{"text":"This is a solid spot - good food, lots of choices. Only complaint here is that there's often a wait (because its good), and when its full the servers and kitchen are too busy too stay on track. The staff are all friendly but they need more people on busy shifts."}
{"text":"Quite frankly the worst Eggs Benedict I've had in my life. Eggs were fried instead of poached, hardly any hollandaise sauce, basically just a drizzle. And unbelievably it came with lettuce, soggy wet lettuce to be exact....for breakfast? Then the kicker was they charged me extra for home fries.  It had the potential to be one of the best because I was excited about the short rib, sadly was the opposite, won't be back here again I'm afraid."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite spot for brunch. The biggest plus for me is that it is a very child-friendly restaurant without being a crappy chain or fast food. The food is good and so is the service. When I take my 13 month old with me the staff are always friendly and accommodating (they will often bring some banana slices for him to munch on..no charge)  There are so many yummy choices on the menu it is often hard for me to decide. If I feel like eggs and something more savory I usually get the veggie overload omelet with feta cheese. It is so good and full of lots of veggies not just onions and green peppers...which I find at a lot of other restaurants. If I feel like something sweet I get the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, light and almost crepe-like compared to the standard buttermilk. The food is fresh and satisfying, not extremely greasy or salty, more like how you would cook at home.  My only cons are that the seating can be tight when the restaurant gets crowded..especially on weekends. The tables are so close along the bench seating it can be hard to squeeze between them to get to the bench (and I am on the slim side) Also, the menu changes a bit with the season, so if you find favorites you might be sad to find them off the menu at times."}
{"text":"I'd have to say that Square Cafe would be my top pick so far for brunch in Pittsburgh.    Its a pretty standard brunch place with cute decor and crowded saturday mornings, with people meeting up to catch up from the week, but it also has a great menu selection, lots of seating, and the portions are on the larger side.  Only complaint I have is that coffee is a little pricey and I know some people like the little mugs they use, but I felt like mine was a little dirty :(.  So far I've only tried the breakfast foods, and all were quite tasty.  Service was also pretty good, even though it's always crowded at Square Cafe.  They also have a large section of seating outdoor, which I love!"}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my food. It seemed that the cook had neglected to put any salt in the food whatsoever. Presumably that was intentional as I have experienced this more than once."}
{"text":"Food is as the bad reviews say: Raw eggs, over cooked sausage and a bland pancake that only has taste of protein powder. The only highlight was being seated right away at 8:30 on a Saturday. Otherwise service was rushed and as unfriendly as you can be without getting fired."}
{"text":"First time in. Tried a breakfast sandwich with chicken apple sausage and provolone. It was just ok, nothing exciting. The sandwich was really hot, or maybe specifically the eggs, and I kept burning my mouth with every bite. Not sure if I'll become a regular but might give it another try sometime (after all, I do live a few doors down)."}
{"text":"This place is cute an kitschy and hip all at the same time! They are very, very vegetarian and gluten-free friendly and helpful with substitutions on almost any menu item. I love the Brussels sprouts galore this fall, and lots of healthy veggie options.  There's a cute latte and milkshake menu, and bottomless coffee from kiva han.  My tofu scramble was light but filling, and the hot sausage burrito was perfectly filling and spicy without overdoing it. This is one of the very rare places that could please me and my family if we came here as a group... That is rare!"}
{"text":"The food was good.  I'm impressed at the number of vegetarian options!  Unfortunately the waitress that served us this morning just can't wait to get us out of there.  She gave us the check without being asked and took the plates away from the table when I asked her for more hot water for my tea.  Very unpleasant experience ..  I would give it another chance due to its vegetarian options and hopefully not have the same waitress."}
{"text":"Came here the first morning I was in Pittsburgh and it couldn't have been better.  Two words.  Perfect.  Bacon.  The Breakfast Eggrolls?  Awesome.  The Bacon, Eggs and Asparagus?  Really good.  Great service in a family friendly, quirky room.  I'd be back all the time if I lived there..."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 5 star now because of service. They had made a slight mistake on my order with the tot mess and did not put a scrambled egg on the top. I asked our server if this was a change in the item but he said it was just a mistake on their part. I knew they were busy so I knew it was an insignificant problem, but our server returned our bill taking off the tot mess because of the small hiccup. I genuinely appreciate this small act of kindness. Having a business care about their customers like this will undoubtedly make me want to return. Thanks Square Cafe!"}
{"text":"Square cafe has the best breakfast I've eaten in Pittsburgh. It was a short drive outside the city and completely worthwhile. The place was packed, but the hostess was extremely professional and efficient in getting everyone seated in a timely manner.  It took only 15-20 minutes on a Sunday morning for us to get to our table. We had the corn beef bene, which was absolutely delicious. It was big chunks of corn beef over rye with braised leaks and poached eggs. It was a very unique spin on eggs Benedict and was perfectly balanced.  We also gluten free pancakes, which I was a bit skeptical of. I have tried many gluten free items before (bread, bagels, muffins) and have always been disappointed. However, these pancakes were by far the best gluten free items I've ever eaten (that classically should contain gluten). They had an amazing texture, which is incredibly hard to do without the use of flour.  I love the classic Pittsburgh spots (Pams, Deluca's), but this place is far better than both."}
{"text":"Decent, unique food but overpriced for what you're getting. Biggest issue was how small the restaurant was. We had a table in the middle and constantly knocked chairs with other tables. Getting to and from the table was the most expensive, makeshift maze money can buy."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, my favorite is the chicken and spinach crepe with Parmesan cream sauce."}
{"text":"A perennial favorite.  The Square Cafe always impresses out-of-towners for breakfast or brunch.  I typically order the specials, but standards like the caprese scramble never fail.  Although you may have to wait for your table on a busy weekend morning, the service is friendly.  The tables are close together, but we made friends with our neighbors.  I was a little disappointed with my most recent visit.  I ordered the polenta special, and the polenta was dry and clumpy.  That being said, the eggs over easy were perfectly cooked.  The coffee hits the spot."}
{"text":"My most visited Pittsburgh spot. I love the colorful decor and staff (who are the epitome of friendly and accommodating). I always look forward to their creative specials, but have a few favorites to fall back on if they don't tickle my fancy. I am also obsessed with the unique square mugs used for all of their incredible hot drinks.    You are destined to find a favorite dish here and fall in love with the cool, quaint cafe in the hip little neighborhood."}
{"text":"The ambience of Square Caf√© is hip and fun, and it's a nice place to take kids, but its food is mediocre and overpriced and the dining area is cramped. My $11 pesto and mozzarella omelette was okay tasting, but overcooked and rubbery. The $2.80 coffee was weak. At least my daughters' French toast was good. Still waiting to find a brunch place in Pittsburgh that serves excellent food.  Our server was very pleasant and the food was served in good time, despite a full house.  UPDATED REVIEW We have since been back to this restaurant on several occasions and my impression of it has definitely improved. Coffee has been consistently very good, pancakes are amazing, and the breakfast burrito I had there recently was fantastic. Not sure if they've upgraded their cooking, but we have been very pleased with their dishes on the whole. Still too cramped, but there's not much they can do about it as long as they are in the space."}
{"text":"As we entered, waitress quickly made eye contact with a smile and had us a table right away. The place has energy and the paint colors and the artwork help keep it up Super friendly staff. The square mugs for coffee are a nice touch for the namesake. Coffee is typical diner coffee. OJ was fresh and cold.   Tons of veggie options - tostada tofu was my choice. Crispy toasta was fine but the tofu, black bean, pepper combo was right on - the salsa tied it together, and for a nice punch, I requested olives on the side. I could do without the aioli, but that's a personal preference. Also got the Challah french toast - can you say HOLLA?!!? Very yummy.   Def will be back when visiting the 'burgh again."}
{"text":"Came with a party of six and left with six happy smiles. Each of us ordered completely different meals and we were all extremely satisfied."}
{"text":"Food was just awesome . I had the crab Benedict . It is so fresh , the servers were nice and it was so nice to sit outside and eat on a calm Sunday morning ."}
{"text":"Ur service suks m8 it took 3 minutes for them to get me a slice of cake while others at my table got it in less than 30 seconds"}
{"text":"Sooo good. I love this place. I've only gone once but can't wait to go back. If anyone is from the Pacific Northwest, you will feel a little bit closer to home when you see all the lumberjack types with beards and non-traditional families (and traditional ones) that fill the small restaurant. I don't know how they can have such a large menu when the dining area is so small. It's definitely worth the wait, though.   They have interesting and delicious ingredient combinations. The miss-matched dishes are cute, everyone is jammed in and having a great time and great food. The pumpkin walnut pancakes are delicious and so are the veggie omelets. Really, it all looked pretty amazing. Like I said, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here numerous times. The food is amazing. Service is friendly. Shakes are delicious. Great atmosphere. It never disappoints."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh salad, crepes small but yummy, ample stuffing in omelets.  Love the bottomless coffee and tea. Friendly and professional service."}
{"text":"Food: many, many options for palates of all varieties, many vegetarian and vegan options, great breakfast/lunch/brunch choices, just got a new menu with even more options, everything we've tried is at least good if not great from breakfast burritos to veggie burgers to pancakes to green eggs and ham (really!)  Price: slightly more expensive than a typical breakfast diner, but well worth the cost of admission, the food is fantastic and they offer so many choices you won't be disappointed  Drinks: coffee is amazing, the smoothies are even better, and the coffee bar is great as well, plus try the homemade lemonade  Atmosphere: slightly cramped seating inside but only because there is always a line to be served because the place is so damn good, outside seating extends down the street and is more spaced and cozy, tables and chairs outside are very nice  Service: friendly and fast, always seated quickly even when there is a line, all meals come out together  (+): the location isn't great (see below) but it is right next to Dz Hot Dog Shop which is the best Six-Pack shop in Pittsburgh, the food is phenomenal, anyone who doesn't rate this as one of the top 10-15 restaurants in Pittsburgh hasn't been here  (-): location (who wants to go to Regent Square?)  Would I go back again? Absolutely"}
{"text":"I was anxious to try this place after hearing many good things about it, but now that I have, I will not go back!  My 2 friends and I meet for lunch every year during Christmas time to catch up and exchange gifts. We planned to meet at 11:30, thinking that the breakfast crowd would be winding down; yet before the crazy lunch time started. Not so...I arrived a little early (11:15), thinking I would get the table and have a cup of coffee only to find out that they will NOT seat you until your entire party has arrived. We were not seated until after Noon. That's a long time to stand in a very tiny entrance way. We ordered salads which were OK, and coffee. They refilled our coffee twice, and the waitress was nice, but she really wanted us to eat and get going, as the long wait line was still growing after 1pm. When we asked about desserts, she said that they had biscotti and a few cookie choices at the counter but weren't really offering any real desserts. We felt so rushed that we left without exchanging our gifts. This is not a cafe where you can sit and leisurely enjoy a cup of coffee with friends; but rather a \"wait, eat & run\" type of place...too bad!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Sunday around 11am, very busy but I was seated within 15min.  My server was prompt and friendly. The cinnamon swirl pancakes with chicken sausage was delicious. Everything was hot, fresh and delicious. Almost forgot to mention, I had the best chai tea latte ever! If you're in the area definitely give this place a visit."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast spot in my life right now!!!! I crave the lemon berry pancakes regularly. Deliciousness. Manfriend enjoys the omelet specials and frittatas too. Tasttttttyyy indeed."}
{"text":"Very yummy food. Great specials and large selection of organic, vegan, gluten free, etc. meals. Amazing pancakes. Usually a wait but still so worth it."}
{"text":"Square Cafe is one of my favorite breakfast or lunch spots in Pittsburgh. Delicious coffee in their unique mugs ( I loved them so much I bought a couple for myself). Friendly staff and vibrant atmosphere. Must get the Brussel Sprout hash and if it's on special the Corned Beef hash. Also love their Chorizo Tostada and Salmon Crepes.It's also fun to sit outside and dog watch in the spring, summer, and fall. For Sundays if you can get there early before 9 (?) or very late in the day is best, though the early crowd generally equals quite a few screeching children (which is fine if that suits your needs - it's nice that it is so accommodating to families in the neighborhood). I like going closer to 1 on a Sunday (or just on weekdays) so I don't feel rushed to clear a table and can keep enjoying another mug of after breakfast coffee."}
{"text":"Square Cafe is a great concept: the menu was full of items made from fresh ingredients with unique combinations. The restaurant had a colorful decor and lively patrons. However, I was not super impressed with my brunch, I felt that something was always missing from my food.  One of the pros of the place was that all the food items had a home-style feel while being unique, which I liked. I got the breakfast burrito: chorizo, eggs, and veggies all wrapped up in a flour tortilla. Coming from Southern California, I was expecting one of those famous Mexican-inspired breakfast burritos you can find in tons of mom-and-pop restaurants, full of meat, cheese, etc. However, what I got was mostly eggs and a sprinkling of the other stuff, aka an omelet wrapped in a tortilla. In summary, the overpowering egg was under seasoned and lacked the Mexican spices I grew up loving. For the price, I did not feel that I got what I paid for.  We also got the Cinnabon-inspired pancake. This was amazing. It tasted like a cinnamon roll.  In terms of the service. I understand it was a busy day, but the lady who was taking people's names in line was extremely rude to my girlfriend. She (girlfriend) accidentally stood in the doorway and apologized after she was asked to move. Even after apologizing, she received an eye roll and scoff. I realize that should not influence the rating too much, but it really set the dining experience to an off-note. I prefer not to start my meals being angry.  My experience was not the greatest. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing. I would love to give this place another shot because it has such great reviews and the menu items sound so promising."}
{"text":"i heard the place was \"pricey\" but by living in coastal california as i do i found it to be affordable, reasonable and serving portions to be worth the price point. the staff was rather nice. they were friendly. i recommend the steak and eggs with butternut squash. if you are in the square looking for a nice place to have brunch, this is the place."}
{"text":"**Warning: $1.00 per egg surcharge for any egg dish**  This is excessive, if not predatory price gouging, for an alleged egg shortage that might be true for one area of the country (Midwest) but certainly not in PA nor is it a national crisis as they seem to suggest.**. Otherwise, the place is a nice contemporary breakfast/lunch eatery. There is a decent veggie/vegan selection, usual breakfast fares but not greasy like most. The youngish staff are cordial."}
{"text":"Place is always packed (sometimes like sardines), and food is consistently delicious. Try the lemon berry ricotta pancakes--TO DIE FOR! Milkshakes and Nancy B. cookies are also great options."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast which included really nice fresh vegetables as part of the omelette/hash."}
{"text":"The best thing I have ever had from them is the lime pancakes, it's not on the regular menu so I enjoy there Nutella crepes until the lime pancakes come back again"}
{"text":"Home is where ever I'm with you!  We're staying at a hotel and our daughter said: I want sunny-side up eggs & pancakes like you make them mom. The service was great! The food was amazing! And our daughter was extremely happy + their hot chocolate hit the spot!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently good here.  The items are a little overpriced, considering you can get the same quality and more quantity at Pamela's.   But for locals it's the only offering,  so I go.  Let me reiterate that the food is consistently good, so I don't mind paying a little more for a good bite.  The filet and sweet potato mash is by far the best thing on the menu for the price,  On the down side pancakes and crepes are generally a la carte, no side of any kind is served with them.. I find that annoying.     The atmosphere is my biggest problem with this place.  The dining room is very small and the foot traffic is a nightmare.  This might be really good new$ for the owners, but it is off putting for those who want a relaxing breakfast.  The seating is not handled with as much grace and poise as I have seen at other busy restraunts manage this blessing of a problem.  Loads of people are crammed into the doorway, there is not a designated waiting area.  You either feel like you are making others uncomfortable by placing your rear in their face as they eat their breakfast OR you are on the recieving end of that discomfort, it's a lose lose.  I am a young 20 something year old, but I have come to Square Cafe with senior relatives, it is certaintly not accomodating to their needs in terms of space or seating.     I would like to give a 2.5 star, which is earned solely by the consistently good food, however a half marking is not possible.  2 is too low, as you will most likely enjoy what is going into your mouth."}
{"text":"I only ordered a organic coffee but this place was super fun inside and the food looked great! My coffee had great flavor. Staff was very warm and friendly. I would enjoy going back some time for breakfast. Indoor and outdoor seating both looked nice.  UPDATE: I went back! I ordered the Holy Lux and it was very good smokes salmon. I loved it!!! My friend ordered the veggie crepes and that was extremely good too. Would definitely eat breakfast here next time I'm in Pittsburg"}
{"text":"They serve Eggs Benedict everyday all day. Awesome.  Great selection of breakfast fare in general with a menu to feed the pickiest eaters to the food adventurous.   Simple atmosphere and a great service staff who can pour a mean shot espresso.  Perfect for catching up with a good friend."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and, unfortunately, my opinion has not changed. While I try my best to support locally owned, neighborhood businesses, they also have to do their part...by providing something I'd like to come back to.   Service was lacking for the price and quality of the decor. Our server displayed what I can only describe as \"attitude\" when we politely asked for a substitution due to a dietary restriction. First she was silent for about 60 seconds and then simply said, \"Ummm NO - we don't do that.\" Well, thank you ma'am!   Also, while I appreciate the fact that they seem to have gone to lengths to put gluten-free options on the menu, unfortunately they were not the tastiest options. The gluten-free corn pancakes had a sour flavor that maple syrup didn't cover...avoid. Also, I thought the homefries my companion got with her omelette were some of the worst I've seen...they were...completely deep fried...more like tiny squares of french fries. In my experience, homefries are supposed to be made from boiled potatoes cut up and sauteed on the grill with onions, etc. and I would expect nothing less for a place that serves $12 omelettes."}
{"text":"We met friends here at 8 am to avoid the rush.  Unfortunately the waitress' agenda of getting us in and out was at odds with our hopes for a relaxing breakfast with friends. The food and coffee was very good as usual but the pushy service made the experience less enjoyable than we had hoped.  I expected better from you Square Cafe!"}
{"text":"I ordered the egg white omelet that had apple chicken sausage and asparagus and it was delicious. It came with fresh fruit, and was definitely filling. The coffee is great also. My boyfriend ordered the salmon crepes that were pretty good, but not worth the price. It definitely was not enough food for him. I do like there many healthy and gluten free options on the menu. It's also nice that you can order a single crepe or pancake if you want to just try one. Yes it is a little pricey, but still worth giving it a try. And like most people wrote the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I came for brunch on a recent Friday. I had the Brussel (sic) Sprout Hash; my companion had cornmeal pancakes and a side of sausage.  The hash was absolutely phenomenal. I normally experiment with different dishes, but if I return to Square Cafe, I will simply order it again. The sprouts were done as perfectly as I've ever had sprouts (tender, but with a little resistance left in them), the ham and onion provided a good counterpoint, and the ensemble was served over (quite good) grits and under a (nicely runny-yolked) egg.  All the flavors worked well together, and the portion was just right for a robust brunch.  My companion allowed me to sample her cornmeal pancakes, which I found to be a competent version of the offering; the berry preserves were excellent, and pairing the pancake with a bite of sausage is quite nice. The portion size was large -- we were unable finish them.  She also assured me that the coffee was top-notch; I did not partake.  I intend to return; if the hash is consistently this good, I may have found a new favorite brunch place.  ----  Quick update: returned this recent Friday, had the Brussels Sprout Hash again. Was not as good as the previous trip. Sprouts were hard (needed a little more time), and the yolk of the egg was barely runny (needed less time). Hoping this was an off day for the chef, and I didn't just get lucky the first time.  Update 2: returned (again) and had the hash (again), and it was prepared more correctly this time -- slightly softer sprouts and runny yolk very much in evidence."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but the food's really good.  I really love their Benedicts and my girlfriend realy loves their hashes.  The milkshakes are really good too.    Only thing disappointing is that the menu changes and then your favorite thing is gone.  The thing you wanted to order when you were thinking about going there.  Seasonal menu woes.    Also, the home fries are lame.  They're basically home fry shaped french fries.  No seasoning or delicious onions mixed in, they're just fried potato chunks."}
{"text":"Square has a giant menu and the happiest most bustling atmosphere you can find in Pittsburgh on a weekend morning.  Everything is cooked well and delicious, and they're super friendly as well.  The coffee mugs are awesome.  My wife and I always split a nutella crepe with mandarin oranges...so good.  I've had burgers, hashes, omelettes, and probably other things I can't remember, but I know everything has been good.  It would be great if they used NoWait as it can be a bit of a long wait when it's cold outside."}
{"text":"So far I've loved everything I've had here, but especially the pancakes- i order one on the side to complement my breakfasts.  A pregnant woman's privilege!  My husband favors the white bean hash, which i was surprised to like as well- love the rosemary."}
{"text":"I love it!!  It's always busy, especially on the weekend.  The first time I went here, I got crepes with Nutella and strawberries.  They were amazing!  The other time I've gone, I got peanut butter pancakes with bananas and chocolate chips.  The pancakes were really fluffy and the flavors really complemented each other.  It's like eating dessert for breakfast.  The decor is really fun, and I love that they sell artwork by local artists."}
{"text":"The service was excellent! The staff are all very nice and the food was prepared promptly. Probably the fastest I've ever gotten my breakfast! On top of that, the food was superb! Everything was fresh and delicious. There are options for everybody- lots of vegetarian, vegan, and even meat lover choices. I will be coming here a lot more often for my first or second meal of the day! Can't go wrong at this place."}
{"text":"I'm lactose intolerant.   I ordered pancakes, eggs, and bacon. The pancakes showed up at my table with whipped cream on them, even though whipped cream wasn't on the menu, and the waitress didn't mention anything about them. After craning my neck around for my waitress, a different waitress came to my table, and I told her that there's no way that I can eat the pancakes since the cream will make me sick. She took my pancakes away and never returned. My initial waitress didn't seem to notice that anything had happened. I never got replacement pancakes. Nobody came back to refill my iced tea, ever. The rest of the food was so-so, but the service was so bad that I'll never, ever go back."}
{"text":"Come here for breakfast or lunch, as it closes at 3.  The food is solid, American, healthy and varied. And the staff is cool.  Lots of omelettes, crepes, excellent salads, including white bean salad over arugula (and I'm not a salad lover), including burgers, meat and veg.  It's often packed for weekend brunch, and during the week it's often got moms with kids during the lunch rush.  Nothing super fancy, but healthy, good, food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The food here always tastes very authentic and delicious. I've gotten the Lox of Love before, and I have to say that the combination of the ingredients they put in made me a very happy customer. I also had their lavender green tea, which was heavenly and something I'd absolutely recommend.  One thing to note is that there is normally around a half hour wait for brunch on weekends, so definitely go early."}
{"text":"Veggie omelette was way over cooked,  hard and dry ... Not good at all ... Very disappointing since I had had better food there a couple of years ago. My companion experienced the same with her omelette. So my advice ... At the very least ... Don't order an omelette ... Especially given the price."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Square Cafe. Not only do they provide amazing, high-quality food, but they create an atmosphere that is nothing short of absolute relaxation. Depending on how long your party size, the wait usually is not bad--in fact, when I went there with a party of two I was seated instantly outside (which was great!).  Regarding the price of food, I did think that it could have been cheaper; however, I did feel satisfied by the food/drinks that were ordered even though it was around $40 for two people. The prime factor that runs up the tab is definitely the drinks (milkshakes are about $5 each, which is a tad expensive...they are very good though!).  Overall, I think everyone should give the Square Cafe a try--it's hard to go wrong here folks! (By the way, if it's nice out, SIT OUTSIDE! It's great!)"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there with a GroupOn coupon.  Parking is free on street.  Braddock Avenue is a busy street but we were fortunate to find a space near the restaurant.  It was 11 a.m. on a weekday and the caf√© was busy but not crowded.  Service was excellent.  My wife requires GF menu and they have a number of gluten free choices.  She had the Brussels Sprout Hash and said it was very good.  I had the Monte Cristo.  It was excellent although I could have done without the greens.  Good sized portions of food.  We would go there again.  Menu is seasonal."}
{"text":"There is always something slightly wrong and rushed about the food. Yesterday, the root vegetable medley had undercooked potatoes which overpowered the other meager root veggies, no seasoning, overcooked egg and burnt ciabatta. The server saw me eyeing the toast and asked Is that too burnt for you? What? Don't serve it burnt! The place is always crowded and clearly they can get away with this.  But shouldn't want to."}
{"text":"Whenever we visit our daughter in Pgh, we always come for breakfast at Square Cafe.  The menu is so creative.  You want bacon and eggs? Fine.  But you want something unique, you will find it here.  I normally won't wait more than 10 minutes for any meal, but i will wait, however long it takes here.  While waiting outside some guy pulled up and asked me why the long wait.  I showed him the menu. on our 8/18/14 visit, i had corned beef hash and eggs.  Whatever image you have of this in your head is wrong.  We are talking chunks of salty lean corned beef, mushrooms and shallots lightly sauteed in sweet butter with tiny potato halves.  All of this sits under two perfected pan cooked over easy eggs.  Add some perfect rye toast and a stunning pottery mug (I bought two) of coffee and you have an unique breakfast for less than what you'ld pay at Dennys.  It is my must visit any time i come to Pgh."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place.   I came here for brunch with some friends and our waiter was AMAZING. He was really really wonderful. He brought our drinks out super quick and took our orders without us having to wait around for a ridiculous amount of time. We all really liked him. Also, Square cafe also has many options that are vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free which is definitely a plus.  What I didn't like was how ridiculously LONG the wait was here. If the food was AMAZING - I could understand the lines of adoring customers, but to be honest, the food is just okay. I feel like they nickel and dime you for additions to your meal like if you want sausage in a breakfast burrito that consists of eggs and cheese. My friend got one of the vegan options and didn't like it that much either. It was just okay... I've had better brunch/breakfast foods elsewhere. I also think that the prices are a little steep for what they're serving.   One thing that really turned me off about this restaurant is how everyone is a vegetarian or a vegan, but they want to make it KNOWN that they are. I don't mind if you don't eat meat or dairy products. Even my friend who was with me who is a vegetarian thought it was obnoxious. We felt like we were living in a real life skit of Portlandia. Someone actually got pissy that the restaurant didn't carry vegan butter. They followed up by saying, \"ugh, I don't get it, it's so easy to make.\" During this conversation this person mentioned MANY times that she was a vegan as if NOBODY within hearing distance didn't hear her the first 9 times she said it.   It was so lame. I hope this place doesn't turn into a pretentious place where people hate on you if you don't eat a gluten free diet.   I just have mixed feelings. There were things I liked and things I didn't. I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here for breakfast during a very short visit to Pittsburgh. The people working there were super friendly and made us feel very welcome. We both ordered iced espresso drinks from their \"Summer Drinks\" menu and they were delicious without being overly sweet. I had their yogurt with honey and granola and added half an avocado (loved this option, even if it *was* a tad pricey) and a side of their chicken apple sausage and loved every bite of my meal!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my boyfriend because I heard great things about it. The place is very cute and cozy, and you can opt for outdoor seating too.   Both of us got the Square Breakfast (choice of protein, pancakes and 2 eggs) but we were pretty disappointed by the portion size. I paid around $12 for my plate, which wasn't worth it at all as we both left hungry.   I probably won't come back for the food, but I'd love to try one of their square specialty lattes!"}
{"text":"The cute decor, friendly staff, interesting menu, and good coffee made Square part of my weekend brunch rotation, but on more than one occasion I've walked away not 100% satisfied.  I find that a lot of the menu items are overpriced ($10 for crepes with ham and cheese? what?) with a lot of additional dollars and cents for cheese on your sandwich/meat with your omelette, etc. The homefries are good but don't satisfy a hungry stomach... and the breakfast sandwich is quite dry.   Oh. The salsa is very very tasty -- but the menu says its made by a local retailer and not the cafe themselves! Hm."}
{"text":"Square cafe is cute. It's not the most amazing delicious food I've ever had, but it beats Denny's. Their lattes are also really good. I'd avoid eggs and go for the pancakes or French toast."}
{"text":"Tasty brunches, cool mugs, lively decor, and reasonable prices.  Also, a brie crepe--whoa.    This is a place I feel excited about visiting for brunches, but also feel like I can afford.  I think they even have free wifi!  (And, yeah, I can walk there.)"}
{"text":"This place is local, quaint, reasonably priced, unique, and friendly. I absolutely loved it. The sunny latte (cinnamon and carmel) is heavenly. It is a new local spot for me!!"}
{"text":"Okay, went for lunch last week.  Not the best lunch in the 'burgh!  Daughter had hamburger, she said it was fine (not as good as Burgatory).  I had Hoppin Johnny which was an egg, rice, blackeyed pea, and greens dish.  It said spicy in the menu.  I say it lacked flavor and was dry!  I asked for Red Hot or Tabasco!  Word to the wise:  when you go, order breakfast (during breakfast time)!  Honestly, I've never had a bad breakfast here until this meal."}
{"text":"We stopped in for the first time yesterday and to say that the entire experience was awesome would be an understatement. The food was amazing! I am a vegetarian and my wife and son are not. They had a menu that accommodated both, and it wasn't light on the vegetarian options either. I had the breakfast burrito with soy sausage, my wife had the breakfast sandwich, and my son had the chocolate chip pancakes. Everyone was impressed with the food. Now the service, I am sorry I didn't get her name, but the young lady that waited on us was above and beyond what a waiter or waitress should be. She should seriously teach a class on how to treat customers! She was quick, refilled our glasses before they were empty, spoke to my son like a person. I would go here again and again! VERY HAPPY WE FOUND THIS PLACE! Great job everyone!"}
{"text":"Great coffee.   Great staff.    Great ingredients and inventive menu.   Prices are higher because of this...but considering the above they are worth it."}
{"text":"I suggested to my brother, one of my best friends, and his two sisters and girlfriend that we try The Square Cafe last weekend for breakfast, and I am glad that I did. The food was incredible - I had the Square Protein breakfast with a Trail Mix pancake on the side - and the coffee was excellent as well. We had to wait around 20 minutes to get a table, but it was 11:30 a.m. on a Saturday, so a wait for good food is to be expected.  The ingredients are organic, the food is prepared well, and the presentation and service is excellent. You get what you pay for, and in this case, you get quality food. Then again, I don't mind paying for high quality items and service. The bottom line is that good food costs money.  I very much enjoyed the coffee and saw nothing wrong with it. Most people are used to drinking rotgut coffee, so perhaps the coffee at Square Cafe is just something foreign to them. It all depends on what you like I guess.  I will most definitely be back here for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"I usually go to square cafe on weekends and I love the outdoor seating and that dogs are welcome. My only complaint is that I wish there was a better wait system. The location makes it difficult to wait because of the size of the space. but not much can be done about that. Food is always excellent and the service has no room for complaints. Love it!"}
{"text":"It's a good thing I don't live in this neighborhood because Square Cafe would have all of my money.  The smoothies here are creative and delish.  I crushed a Butter Bean in less than 10 minutes because it was so tasty.   The cafe is on the smaller side so when it's packed on the weekend you can feel overwhelmed. That wouldn't stop me from coming during the morning breakfast rush but some people might mind.  Very large and diverse menu with dishes for just about anyone.   If you're in the area and looking for a good breakfast spot, Square Cafe is your jam."}
{"text":"I had heard so many great things about this place, so when Tim suggested it for brunch on Saturday, I immediately grabbed the car keys.   We opened our brunch with a specialty latte. My Sunny Chai was heaven in a cup. His Cinnamon Bun was a softer, more subtle flavor.   For food, I ordered the Chorizo Crepes. I was upset because they were so delicious, but incredibly spicy. I couldn't take more than a few bites. I had some rye toast to tide me over. Tim had the special - Short Rib Benedict - a brioche bun topped with short rib, an egg, and hollandaise sauce. OH MY. It was the most delicious thing I'd ever had for breakfast. We finished up with some coffee and singing.  The atmosphere of the Square Cafe is so on point - bright, cheery, merchandise for sale, attentive and fast service, delicious food, and a great music playlist."}
{"text":"Food is really bad. They spoilt a nice morning with tasteless food that included bad breakfast and very slow service. Also the menu is expensive. Try Pamela's"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast/brunch with family, including small children. Service was great and food was delicious. Kids gobbled up their French toast. Would definitely go back when visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"had the pancakes and bacon both were good, also brussels sprout hash, very good, this is a place that is busy but worth the wait, theres a reason there's a long line , friendly staff our waiter was very good, would go again"}
{"text":"I come early to avoid the children and the social commentary. Never had a bad meal here, ever. I've had roughly 3/4 of the menu. Their salads are so huge and tasty that men eat them. They keep it local, seasonal, fresh and classic.   The people who say the portions are small probably want Pamela's -- the Primanti's of breakfast."}
{"text":"You should know up front that I have a special attachment to the Square Caf√©. I grew up in Regent Square, so I've been rooting for its success from the very beginning. Boy, am I happy to tell you that this place just Keeps Getting Better.  The crowds of people waiting to get a seat (sidewalk caf√© al fresco style if it's warm) should not deter you. The staff is efficient, so get close to your neighbors in the teeny waiting area and just enjoy the local flavor. The good stuff is on its way sooner than you think!  I love that the walls are decorated with local artwork for sale, and the atmosphere just makes me happy. Very bright, clean and retro-modern.   Breakfast/Brunch: A resounding yes. Anything I've had has been delicious. While the menu has changed slightly over the years, I can recommend the side of potatoes (perfectly bite sized, crispy and salty) the tofu scramble that even meat eaters will enjoy and the breakfast burrito (ole!). Meals usually come with a slide of toasted ciabatta. Do yourself a favor and forget your no-carb diet, add a healthy smear of jelly, and ENJOY.  Lunch: I get the same thing every time for lunch, just because it's so good: chicken salad on a wrap with lettuce and tomato, with a side of fries. I almost don't want to write about it, because it will make me HUNGRY. I always promise myself that the next time I'll try something else, because it all looks so good, but I can't cant give up an opportunity for this sandwich. It's creamy and crunchy in all the right places, and the fries will knock your socks off. (The sweet potato fries leave something to be desired, however. Stick with the regular.)"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful and the staff excellent.  There's always interesting specials and something for everyone.  Weekends are hectic but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked omelets, the most delicious hash browns, bottomless coffee in cool mugs, and friendly, attentive service!"}
{"text":"I appreciated that they were very kid-friendly but we were served the worst pancakes I've ever had at a restaurant. Unfortunate since we live so close but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food was excellent and a lot of great selections on the menu.  The atmosphere was relaxed and  comfortable.  I will definitely return.  I had the Greek omelet,  the best!"}
{"text":"My first visit to the Square Cafe was fabulous. We were there on a beautiful, sunny Monday and it wasn't too busy. We were seated quickly and our server was prompt and friendly. The atmosphere was so nice--everyone seemed relaxed and happy. Our food was great...there's something for everyone. I have not one bad or even ambivalent thing to say. Would DEFINITELY go back."}
{"text":"Good food, though a bit nuts on the weekend. My biggest complaint is actually a compliment: I wish they were open at nights -- my favorite time to eat breakfast food! Please extend hours!!"}
{"text":"Really awesome breakfast and brunch. I got a crab and spinach crepe which rocked! Service is good and they are friendly!"}
{"text":"There was definitely good and bad about Square Cafe.    First, the good: I had a fantastic brunch meal.  I had the Brussels sprout hash (caution: not vegetarian) and a single order of the pumpkin walnut pancake.  My hash was served over cheesy grits and had an over easy egg on top.  It was delicious.  The pancake was sweet but not too sweet.  But there was bad: We were forgotten about.  Which is fine, and understandable on a very busy Saturday morning.  But we were made to feel bad about being there, about being forgotten, about wanting more than one cup of $3.00 bottomless coffee, about one member of our party's food being left unmade, about not leaving.  It was such a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Sunday breakfast 1/14/18 for four of us - had a great time and great food! Our waiter Joe recommended things that were a home run - who knew brussels sprouts could be good for breakfast?! Nice vibe, and the staff were all very attentive. Don't get to Pittsburgh very often,  but will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"A local gem! Great family-owned business. Wonderful sense of community, with local artists' work showcased everywhere. Pancakes that are out of this world. Service that is polite and efficient. Very kid-friendly, yet other patrons were all ages. The best breakfast we have had in Pittsburgh, hands down. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I had brunch here with a friend this morning and really enjoyed it! The cafe was very busy but we were seated within a few minutes of arriving. Some of the servers seemed a little grumpy, although our primary server was friendly. I ordered the \"Hopple Popple\". This dish features three scrambled eggs with a variety of veggies including peppers, onions, chopped fingerling potatoes, spinach and mushrooms topped with Amish cheddar. I loved it. My friend had the salmon crepes, which had smoked salmon, light cheese, herbs and oven-roasted tomatoes. This dish was outrageously tasty and if you're in the mood for a salmon brunch dish, I would highly recommend it. The pieces of salmon on top were a bit dry but, eaten with the sauce, it was delicious. The homefries were serviceable but plain - no onion, peppers, or discernible seasoning. I noted to myself for future reference that they have breakfast burritos on the menu.  They also have a coffee bar with stool seating that offers a wide variety of specialty coffee drinks and teas."}
{"text":"Oh, Square Cafe. I wanted to like you so badly. I've been meaning to come here for years. Then I moved to Chicago, and on subsequent visits to Pittsburgh never made it to Square Cafe. Recently, I saw a Groupon for this restaurant and decided to use it on my trip to Pittsburgh this weekend. I was looking forward to it; the menu looked great and the reviews were good. I went there yesterday, and my entire family was disappointed.  Service was okay -- not the most attentive in the world, but it was decent. The food, though, wasn't good. I had the lemon-berry ricotta pancakes, which weren't cooked all the way through. The middle in two of the three pancakes was uncooked batter. My mom said her hamburger tasted like a frozen patty from the grocery store and had a strange aftertaste. My dad's eggs were cold. And my brother, who will usually eat everything on his plate, ate less than half of his chorizo tostada. My brother and I took our meals in to-go boxes (I figured I could heat up the pancakes the next day and fix the problem of them not being cooked all the way through, but I tried to eat them this morning and they still tasted bad). My mom's burger was mostly uneaten, and to his credit the server asked if there was a problem. My mom said she didn't like it. Most restaurants would take it off the bill at that point, but Square Cafe didn't.  I'm giving it two stars because the restaurant is cute and the coffee is pretty good. I asked for a to-go cup for my leftover coffee, and the server actually brought me a to-go cup of fresh coffee, which was very nice of him. That was one of the few things that bumped this review up to two stars.  Also, it's expensive ($50 for four people before the Groupon). My dad said later that we could have gotten similar, better-tasting food for half the price somewhere else."}
{"text":"Tons of selection. It's always packed so the wait is never fun, but the food is so worth it! Very dog friendly too- they have milkbones in the waiting area and water bowls out front :)"}
{"text":"expensive! four of us for lunch was over $100 not including tip. but so good! daily specials are awesome. pumpkin pancakes. red velvet pancakes. turkey sausage. kill me now. so delicious!"}
{"text":"Square cafe is a perfect brunch spot. As a Pittsburgh native, I'm familiar with the other local chains and this one is by far my favorite. A lot of variety and solid service. Pittsburgh restaurants tend to start out great and then slowly deteriorate over time, but Square Cafe has avoided this curse.   I give it 4 stars because although the food is really good, it's nothing exceptional. Also they do not offer any alcoholic beverages ( I don't think)."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and drinks, friendly staff, and a great atmosphere filled with local art. This is a great place to check out if you're visiting the city or showing some visitors what's great about Pittsburgh. If the weather is nice they even have some nice sidewalk seating to let you drink in the sights and sounds of regent square. If you're looking for a great spot for a delicious and satisfying breakfast or lunch you can't go wrong with the square cafe."}
{"text":"Went to brunch there with a friend and the food was great! My friend had a great groupon so our food was super cheap. The waitress was really friendly and served our food on time, despite the place being packed."}
{"text":"The food is really good, but a little expensive for what it is; the service is apathetic, but not offensive. The milkshake and hot drink menu is expansive and delightful. I really only go when I have out of town visitors, it isn't worth the line or prices if you live in Pittsburgh. But it is perfect for taking out of towners to brunch because it has something for everyone. Square has an extensive menu that is especially great for your vegan and vegetarian friends while still being great for meat eaters- a rare feat."}
{"text":"What a long wait on Sunday morning but totally worth it. Love the location and outside seating if the weather permits... Nice flavor and friendly staff ... Will definitely go back !"}
{"text":"This place is such a little gem. We went on a thursday morning that my husband and I randomly took off work. It's a small place and was very busy. I can't imagine weekends. Food came out super quick though and waitress was really friendly and attentive. Coffee was served in awesome mugs. I might buy one next time as they have them for sale. We both had the brussel sprout hash (amazing!) And split an order of apple cinnamon oatmeal pancakes (fluffy vanilla apple deliciousness!) A little pricey but definitely worth it, especially when you're supporting a local businesses!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my sister. I have been wanting to go here since they offer vegan options. It's a quirky and young cafe.  I first ordered the johnny cakes with bananas and chocolate chips. On the menu they were marked as vegan, so I was excited. When it came out my sister noticed a slab of butter on the plate, so I took it back. It turns out that they're not vegan and the menu was misprinted. They didn't even know, and I had to show them.   I also think the menus were their new fall menus as well. But they were nice about it, and I got the actual vegan fig pancakes instead. It was an inconvenience and they need to fix it. I also wish they had more vegan possible options on the menu. My sister ordered the crab crepes without a problem.  Both of our meals were still good, they just new to fix their vegan/vegetarian items on their menu."}
{"text":"Love this place and its atmosphere. Always a great spot for a weekend brunch or week day breakfast if you are playing hookie!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to the Square Cafe, and I'll absolutely return.   When my roommate and I arrived today, we were greeted to full tables (both inside and out) and a long queue of people waiting to be seated.  Although this looked like it would be at least an hour wait, we were told it would only be around 15 minutes.  Deciding not to wait for a table, a counter seat became available just minutes later, and we took those instead.  Although it was crowded, there was good flow in and out, so I don't doubt that the 15 minute estimate would have been close.  The food.... amazing choices here.  I'm vegetarian and my roommate is vegan, which poses an incredible challenge in Pittsburgh for no apparent reason.  The selections were clearly marked \"V\" for vegetarian and \"VE\" for vegan, although we were told that many of the V can be made VE quite easily.    As others have noted, the coffee here is fresh, bottomless and served in cool, square mugs.  No doubt, the squareness of the mugs adds to the taste.  I had the breakfast burrito with some added soy chorizo.  It came with sour cream and salsa.  Good vegetarian food is more than just a combination of plant-based ingredients.  When done right, it's truly amazing and makes you go, \"wow!\"  My breakfast was a home run!  Just the right size, and just the right combination of flavours.  My roommate had pancakes that were flavoured with pecans, cinnamon and other good things that reminded me of a big coffee cake-like-something that my mom always used to have around the house for company.  They were quite tasty as well, although I could never eat all that fluffy pancake mass by myself.  He could barely finish his meal.  After breakfast, I had a lemon bar (out of this world with just the right tartness and lemony goodness).  These are hidden on the counter, so  you need to look there when you go.  One of my biggest gripes with restaurants in Pittsburgh is the service which generally ranges from lackluster to downright awful.  Not here!  Sitting at the counter, we had the chance to talk to several of the folks that worked there.  The owner came over and introduced herself.  We didn't wait for anything (even the food, which came surprisingly fast for the crowd they had), but we were not pestered in search of a big tip either.  One important thing was apparent... everyone who works here really likes what they do and it shows.    Additional points to the staff for knowing that some of the ingredients in certain items were not vegan.  That's pretty rare, and often requires a trip to \"ask the chef.\"    I left here happy today and that's saying a lot for a first trip to a new place.  There's nothing I would have changed, but so many other things I want to try that I'll HAVE to go back!"}
{"text":"I typically LOVE Square Cafe (which is why I'm giving it 5 stars) but I just got take out from there and the brussel sprout hash was almost inedible because it was so salty. I'd think twice about ordering that, but everything else I've ever had has been delicious. And the wait staff are always very nice."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Visiting home and most of the food available was meat and potatoes...But not here!  Definitely a cut above and interest beyond the norm! Allergy aware and may delicious and interesting options to try.  And the coffee! best coffee we had in the Burgh - brewed or specialty.  Had brewed regular there and got a latte to go!  What they are doing, they are doing well. Also square mugs??? Thought it would feel akward in  my hands, exact opposite.  Brought one home to the ATL and only wished I had brought more."}
{"text":"Such an awesome hipster place! Great food, great atmosphere  You got to try the brussels sprouts hash, most excellent.  Come for breakfast or lunch you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Jumping local breakfast joint, and one of the very few places in Pittsburgh to get a vegan breakfast.   I ordered the the vegan pancakes, with fig compote, which were great. What was disappointing was that there were only 2 vegan mains on the menu (quite a few more were vegetarian). I also got a side of fruit, which was OK, although the grapes might have been a little moldy. The coffee was great though.   Gf's breakfast burrito (not vegan) apparently was pretty bland, and because of the limited options, I can't give it 5 stars.   Still, for vegans, this is still one of the best places to go. Just go early, since it's very busy."}
{"text":"Absolutely adorable. I love the Square Cafe, and if I lived near here, I would make it a weekend breakfast tradition. The staff here are amazing, very nice and laid back. The decor is cute, but not in-your-face. Even the plates and glassware is cute! I ordered the key lime pancakes, which I was a little on the fence about. It was their special for the day and I love key lime pie, so I just ordered it and decided to take the risk. The pancakes were amazing!!! It was key lime with some berries, a perfect balance of tart and sweetness. I was really happy with the decision. My friend ordered the fruit crepes... I won."}
{"text":"We were traveling through Pittsburgh on a road trip and some friends recommended this place as a good place for plant based, vegetarian / vegan meals. We decided to try it out. We waited 30 minutes to be seated which was okay since it seemed like a really popular place. Our waitress wasn't very welcoming. I asked if we could have plain buttered pasta for our son and she asked in the kitchen and said no special requests. I then asked if they had any raw veggies or plain fruit and she said no. My chickpea sandwich was good but my mixed greens weren't edible. The lettuce was wilted and brown, who ever made up my plate obviously didn't care about the quality of the food.   I appreciate a restaurant where the menu has healthy choices but it seems that the staff and chef should be more concerned about the happiness of the customer.   Wish we had went to the East End Co-Op instead."}
{"text":"I was passing through Pittsburgh on a road trip and Square Cafe came highly recommended from several people as a great breakfast/brunch/lunch spot. 2pm on a Monday it was pretty empty since they were closing soon but man am I glad I got to try it. Brussels sprout hash for the win! Wow! So so so good! It was so fresh, filling, and delicious, the perfect lunch for fueling a long car ride!  The restaurant itself is absolutely adorable too, and located on such a cute small town USA-type of street. The service is good, food comes out quickly, and the prices are great too!"}
{"text":"Square cafe is where it's at in the weekends! If you are looking for a place that has a great variety of food choices and amazing coffee, this is the place to go.   The menu is vast and has options to satisfy many food restrictions, both for breakfast and lunch. They offer vegetarian options as well as carnivore options. One of my favorite dishes is the French toast with the vegan compote. Tofu scramble is a really close second. Chocked full of earthy veggies and delicious flavors, it won't disappoint.   The venue itself is on the smaller side. During the warmer months, tables are set up outside and the available seating expands by close to double. In the winter, it can be tough to get a table inside. There is typically a wait but it's definitely worth it. The seating is a bit cramped, which is the only reason it doesn't get a full five stars. Parking can also be challenging in Regent Square, and side streets are your bet option.   If you're looking for a new place to try, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tucked in the middle of Regent Square, Square Cafe is a neat breakfast spot to check out. They specialize in their vegetarian and vegan dishes and their full service coffee/espresso bar at the front of their restaurant. I ordered the breakfast burrito. It was filling and flavorful! I also got a vanilla latte which was a warm addition on a cold, windy day. If you're looking for a place that offers unique breakfast combinations (try the lemon berry ricotta pancakes) then you should definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast place, very small, always a wait.  Menu is ok not great"}
{"text":"I heard so many great things about Square Cafe and couldn't wait to try it.  It is located on the cute street of South Braddock in Regent Square and always has a huge crowd of people waiting outside. Get there early to get a seat as it is packed on the weekends.  We went on an early Sunday morning and were able to get a seat for two outside with no wait which I wasn't expecting but it was perfect!  I had the avocado bacon omelet which was amazing-stuffed with bacon and tomatoes and topped with fresh avocado.  We also tried the breakfast tacos but beware they are super spicy.  On a past visit I had the oatmeal pancakes and French toast which were simply delicious.  Great place for kids and you can sit outside with your dog."}
{"text":"The only thing square about this place is the tables. Their menus and interior was really well done, but their portions are insanely small. It felt like I was having a kids meal.   I got the square breakfast for $10 which included 2 eggs with a choice of meat and pancake. I emphasize pancake, because you only get 1 piece.   For $10 you could've easily given me an extra pancake, or an extra piece of sausage, or use bigger eggs?   To whoever reading this, go elsewhere if you're hungry because you won't be full here."}
{"text":"There's a lot of good going on at this place. Was first introduced through recommendations of friends who raved about it, so that was encouraging. As I've tried it on several occasions, thought it was time for a review. I've generally liked my experiences here, but what I appreciate most is the family friendly, community vibe. They're also known for their support of fellow local businesses. I've tried their sweet and savory dishes. In the past, I've had the root medley, brussel sprout hash, breakfast burrito, pancakes, and seasonal coffees (have more pics than shown here). The lemon ricotta pancakes are what have stood out the most, and I'll definitely go back for those! They change up the hot bevies seasonally which is fun. I chose the standard square breakfast this last time, it comes with your choice of meat. The menu for my meal says \"and toast\", but I was charged extra for it. Not sure if I misinterpreted something. The dish was okay, and that's generally how I feel about their food. It's not been consistently good in each of the dishes I've tried. It's in the middle of the road cost wise, but that's because of the quality of their food and their local sources, which I understand. My last check did take me aback for a simple breakfast though. A fellow yelper pointed out the plate share fee, which I have never seen or heard of. With that said, I do like this place, for the cozy neighborhood vibe and friendly customer service. Great outdoor seating during warmer days. Place gets packed so plan ahead!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, I had the corned beef Benedict. Very busy the service not that good."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd enjoy floppy pancakes, but somehow these were amazing.  A little sweet and packed full of flavor.  The sausage was also ridiculously good.    Square Cafe has inspired me to start a new list...  I got there a little after it opened and it filled up quickly thereafter."}
{"text":"Square is great!  I'm a vegetarian, so having the soy sausage, tofu, and meatless dishes available is wonderful.  I've never had a bad meal there.  I also love that they typically offer a fill up and to-go cup for your coffee before you leave.  I was recently there with my son, who loves it as well (very kid friendly), and I got one of their signature dishes - the Brussels sprouts over cheesy polenta, with a soft boiled egg on top, and some soy sausage as a replacement for ham.  OMG - best.breakfast.ever!  I ate the whole, HUGE, dish.  I will definitely be back for that.  I think the two big drawbacks to Square are these: 1.  A bit pricey.  This isn't your typical corner diner.  Even though we live close, we only go once in a while.  Its a great place to take guests from out-of-town, or to go for a special treat.  However, going on a weekly basis might break the budget a bit.  2.  Seating.  Most greasy spoons have horrible seating though, right?  Especially during peak times (Saturday and Sunday mornings).  People are practically sitting on top of each other, and wait staff has to do magic tricks in order to get orders to tables.  This is annoying, but its a popular place.  If you're looking for a quiet breakfast on a Sunday, Square is not for you."}
{"text":"This is primarily a breakfast place? REALLY??? I ordered my eggs over medium and got overcooked leathery eggs. If you can't serve up an egg correctly, you have no right serving breakfast. They are overpriced and the service is mediocre at best...  Does this place have anything going for it? The menu has lots of variation and is a standard urban mix of of what appear to be high quality ingredients... but if you don't cook them well, what am I paying for? A for effort and F for follow through?"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast food here. They have a variety to choose from and their shakes/smoothies are bombb. The first time I came I think I ordered one of their pancakes... but I came a second time today and ordered their Square Breakfast. I asked for scrambled eggs, breakfast sausage and a buttermilk pancake. Unlike other breakfast places, the food here isn't too greasy and heavy. Everything tastes clean and fresh. I would get their tiramisu shake if you can!   There's also outdoor seating which is really nice when the Pittsburgh weather clears up. I understand that when it gets busy, the service goes down a bit but both times that I've come, the service wasn't the best."}
{"text":"This is truly a great place to brunch (and I know my brunch: see my list for further details). I've only been here twice, mostly because it's a bit further away than other places in the East End and also because the wait here is generally a day and a half. The wait makes me want to bump this down to three stars, but I don't think I can because of the quality of the food and service. When I brunched here two weeks ago, they event put out blankets on all of the seats outside to keep the brunchers warm! But seriously, the people who work here are very nice. I've gotten the pumpkin pancakes (yyyyuuuuummmmm) and some sort of banana chocolate pancakes (double yum). And I love the cute coffee mugs they have for coffee and tea. I'll continue to stop in here once in a blue moon for my brunch needs."}
{"text":"This is place is adorably cute! I've come here on weekends and not waited a long time for a table for two. However, this place can get super crowded which lets you know how great the food is! I usually get a breakfast item, and they just changed their menu. An Egg Benedict dish seems to be the speciality, because I saw several of them upon entering the restaurant. Outdoor seating is available."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service! Home made corned beef hash was amazing! So was the lemon ricotta pancake."}
{"text":"Square Cafe is charming and is worth visiting in the warmer months when you can sit outside. The menu is extensive although they did remove one item that we liked and kept us coming back. The food is delicious. I have always had good service despite being pretty busy. The only reason I rate it 4 stars is because their prices are excessive. It's worth visiting at least once for all of those who haven't tried it. I recommend purchasing a Groupon so that you aren't paying $20 pp for your breakfast."}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite breakfast spot in pittsburgh. Been here many times and it never disappoints. Super friendly service, amazing food, great coffee, cool space with local art on the walls. Also, very popular. Expect to wait for a table just about every time.   Here's the lowdown on food today. I ordered uncle Charley's hot sausage burrito. Eggs, sausage, beans, green peppers. Salsa. Sour cream. Delicious. Also had the home fries. Cooked and seasoned perfectly. Brussels sprout grits was also spot on. Very tasty grits. Pumpkin walnut pancake on the side that was the perfect sweet treat. Wash it down with their coffee and you've got a winner. Eat it!!"}
{"text":"Square Cafe was INCREDIBLE & SUPER ACCOMMODATING to our large party! My entire family was in town for my cousin's college graduation, & we were wanting to find a local brunch spot. Since we had a party of 14 & Square Cafe is a little small, the host and I figured splitting the group in half would be the best idea. It ended up working out perfectly because the entire party didn't show up right away, and the host was so kind enough to reserve a table next to our table despite the Cafe being busy and crowded! In the end, the entire family was able to enjoy brunch together!!   I wish I had taken pictures of our food because everything was amazing! I got the Brussels sprouts hash, & I would definitely order that again! My family was raving about the burgers, & the salmon omelette! Not to mention their coffee & breakfast food was delicious as well :) We had the best server, Steven, who was super friendly and patient with our family. He even gave us some of his chalk calendars that he made as a little souvenir! Go check them out if you're in the area!!"}
{"text":"I'm actually disappointed with my first Square Cafe experience. I ordered the Nutella crepes or I thought I did. When my food came out... I only received one crepe. There was an option to order one, but I ordered the crepeS --- plural. I didn't bother saying anything to the waitress about it because we only saw her twice the whole visit. Additionally, we had only one set of silverware, and I waited for well over five minutes before I was able get someone on the wait staffs attention. I also ordered bacon. 3 bacon strips for $5. Didn't really seem worth it to me to be honest.   Overall, the wait staff wasn't very attentive (they were busy, but It should not have taken me as long as it did to flag someone down for silverware) and the bacon was disappointing. However, the one crepe I had was really good. I wish I would have received the full order!"}
{"text":"I love love love Square Cafe. We drive by often in our way to work and the place is always bustling at breakfast. We stopped on a weekday around lunch to avoid the rush, and had a Groupon in hand. No issue at all using it, like some small businesses. My husband had a breakfast quesadilla of some sort that was fantastic. The tortilla was freshly made, eggs were light and fluffy and the sausage was perfectly seasoned. I'm a big breakfast fan. I had the hazelnut pancakes. They were good. But not as good as my husband's dish. There was plenty of seating inside and out. We finished brunch with a fresh smoothie, which was light and not sickeningly sweet. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"This my favorite place!  I go every other Saturday so the nostalgia of my first experience doesn't ware off!  I absolutely love this place.  Every time I come I am never disappointed.  It heathy, delicious, and happy eating.  The workers are friendly, and so are the people who done.  Every month they feature a community artist work on their walls.  I have tried just about everything and to me it's all delicious!!  My absolute favorite right know... Since the menu changes every season... Is the Short Rib Benedict.  It comes with corn fritters topped with slow cook short ribs, caramelize onions two eggs over easy and hollandaise sauce served with fresh greens. Yummy!!!  I also love their Gluten Free Berry Pancakes serves with fresh berries and a drizzle of honey.  No syrup needed!  I recommend this place to all who want fresh, delicious options for breakfast and lunch!!!  You will enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it five stars because of the ambiance!  I walked in and was immediately greeted. It was packed full of people who seemed very pleased. Probably a lot of regulars.  Very clean and hip. They have outdoor seating and good iced coffee  The workers were very nice. I didn't get the chance to eat here because I already had breakfast but I plan to come back the next time I'm in town.  There's a get-go gas station at the corner and a theatre and several shops. Nice neighborhood."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast spot in Pittsburgh!!!! We knew we stumbled on to a winner when we pulled up to the restaurant and the line was pouring out onto the sidewalk. We figured the food must be good with such a long line and almost left thinking the wait would be too long. The host told us the wait would be about 20 minutes and he was almost exact in his timing. So glad we waited!!   The place itself is very bright and cheery. Very colorful, interesting and locally sourced artwork. I knew I was in the right place when I saw the staff wearing T-shirts that said \"Love Each Other\" with unicorns and rainbow artwork.   Now on the the food - First of all it came out extraordinarily fast, cooked to perfection and prepared just the way I asked. I had eggs, homefries & Italian Chicken Sausage (which was amazing). For the table we shared the Lemon Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes, which were out of this world and the Brussel Sprout bowl which was superb!   Everything was amazing and the staff was excellent. Also, they serve a bottomless cup of Joe for $2.80 AND they will give you a to-go cup, which was greatly appreciated as we were making the long drive back to the Philadelphia area after brunch.  If you are looking for a delicious, reasonably priced meal in a beautiful, warm and accepting space, Square Cafe is your place. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A great versatile brunch/lunch spot for any kind occasion.  I ate the Say Uncle sausage and my friend ordered a cheesesteak crepe. The crepe was especially tasty with a really savory sauce on it.   I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a good brunch spot in the burgh! If you're sick of Pamela's go check out Square cafe!"}
{"text":"Awesome and creative menu, really good food and a fun atmosphere. They have the coolest coffee mugs too! The staff is the icing on the cake.. they are the sweetest. You are missing out if you have not dined here!"}
{"text":"Yes, the staff is fun, attentive, helpful and super. Yes, the food is fabulous, inventive, hearty and delicious. Yes, it's a great place to grab breakfast and lunch outside during the warm days and inside during the cold days. These things have all been said before and will be said forever because Square Cafe is wonderful! You should also know that they mix some of the best milkshakes in Pittsburgh, which I feel not enough people remember about this place. They also cater off site, so you could still have their tasty bites when they're not open. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Ok. I admit it. I love breakfast.   I have been wanting to try this place but its a little out of my way so it took a while. The place is bustling and colorful!   Pros: Interesting omelets, creative menu, quirky coffee mugs, fast service, Nancy B's Cookies.   Cons: Smaller portion side  Overall: If I am in the hood I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Most of the stuff on the menu here is standard, but they do have some unique dishes. They also have a TON of Veg options, which is nice. I got the mushroom melt... It was ok, but a friend got the special, which was croissant french toast.. It was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a cute place and a nice, bright way to start the morning.  The service is awesome.  Lemon ricotta pancakes are definitely where it's at.  I wasn't a big fan of the pulled pork eggs bene..kind of dry and bland.  It's a bit overpriced for a breakfast spot.  Coffee is really great, and I love the mugs that it's served in."}
{"text":"Square Caf√© is a great place with a diverse menu that includes vegan and vegetarian options. The space is rather tight and crowded, but that's a good sign that they are always packed. The food is always delicious and unlike anything you can get at a typical breakfast or lunch chain. I wish they'd open a few more locations around Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"By the time we'd arrived at Square Cafe we'd walked four miles through Frick Park and to two restaurants that were reportedly open but weren't on the fourth of July, so I figured my review might be tainted by the fact that I was ready to eat tree bark when I got here.  But even once my initial hunger was satiated, it was delicious.I mean, really crazy delicious. I got chicken crepes with mushrooms and I could have eaten a second...not because they are small, but because they are the type of excellent food that encourages me to overeat. My brother got salad and pancakes (he's weird like that) his wife also got the crepes and I think he felt left out. They were that good.   Super adorable interior and friendly service. And reasonable prices.  When I think of places I'd like to live if I move back to PA, Regent Square comes right to the top of the list and I have to give the square some kudos for factoring the neighborhood into consideration :)"}
{"text":"I lived in Pittsburgh for a bit 20 years ago and still like to visit when I can. The food scene has just been exploding in wonderful ways, and this place is a fine example. The ambiance is clean and bright and cozy, if a little snug. Beautiful, funky decor. Service was fantastic, friendly but not a surveillance state. The coffee was sooooo gooood! And my pesto scramble was a great brunch. Tasty brioche toast and potatoes came with it, and I also got some maple sausage links. Price on all this seemed quite reasonable. Many great looking menu items ensure I'll make another visit next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Square Cafe is absolutely my favorite place to go for breakfast/brunch.  We have been there more times than I can count, and nearly every time is wonderful.  The food tastes so fresh and delicious.  I also love how great they are towards kids AND dogs!  We take our son and chihuahua there in the summertime so that we can sit outside and enjoy the day.  Most of the time they'll bring her over some water to drink - very nice.  The choices as far as food goes are great, and the coffee is (almost) always very good!  I'm a vegetarian, so it's really nice to have a place that is veggie-friendly with lots of choices (that's also very rare).  And the breakfast potatoes are AWESOME!  The only reason I give Square Cafe four stars instead of five is because of their prices.  They are pretty overpriced actually.  I almost always get the same thing (Veggie Overload Omelet - yum!), but it's painful to have to pay over $2 extra to add cheese to it... sigh... but I still do it.    Square Cafe will continue to get our business for a many yerrs to come."}
{"text":"I've heard the praises of square cafe for years but have resisted it's indirect advances as best I could. I gave in today, and I'm super happy about it. We had the Brussels sprout hash and tot hash and they were both insane good. Gemma, our waitress, is maybe the nicest person ever. I want to be friends after this. Great coffee, I'll be back to try more and high five the waiters all over the place!"}
{"text":"Love Square Cafe! Live nearby and have gone several times. Outdoor seating is great. Today I sat indoors which is just as nice. Super kid friendly. I would recommend going during the week opposed to the weekend. Less busy and no wait time. I have ordered several things off the breakfast menu and its always good. Today I ordered the chorizo omelet and that did not disappoint. This place would be 5 stars if everything was about $2 less."}
{"text":"The Square Cafe has good food and solid coffee in an independent atmosphere serving more \"ethical\" and healthy food than most diners. This makes it a little more expensive than most places you get bacon and eggs, but the food and service are solid.   Breakfast places are usually a greasy and comforting start to my day- bacon, eggs, toast, hash browns etc. Square Cafe has all these, but they get all their food as locally and organically as they can. The food tastes great, and the coffee is good, but be prepared to spend more here than you would at Denny's or Eat'n'Park, or Pam's. The bacon is thick cut and awesome, the eggs are done right and the coffee has caffeine.   The staff is great- attentive without hassling you and sitting outside is a great experience."}
{"text":"I just can't get enough of this place. Love it here. I am dieting and have lost 24#. It was important to me to be able to stick to my diet. I PM'd Square on FB and asked to create my own meal. They said no problem but then I got there and looked at the menu and said I am having what I want and I will just be responsible to stay within my calorie limits for the day. I had the Latke Lox. Incredible!!!!  It is a potato pancake topped with smoked salmon, sliced tomato and two eggs then sprinkled with red onion, capers and more tomato. I kept my hollandaise on the side so I could control this delectable sauce.  This is my new favorite. I say this after almost every meal here. And life it too short not to have a Stormy Chai. So silky smooth and tasty. I only had a small. I miss my usual 20 oz but 12oz is better than 0. Now I enter everything I eat into MyFitnessPal. I needed to know how many ounces of salmon I had so I asked. I briefly explained that I was logging all my calories and greatly appreciated her help. She asked if I wanted to see all the ingredients from my Chai so I could accurately add it to my diary. How thoughtful of her. She did not have to do that but that is how Square employees roll. They go above and beyond every day for their customers. And let's not forget that they told me the day before I could create my own breakfast which for the record was going to be half an English muffin topped with saut√©ed spinach, smoked salmon and one egg. Hollandaise on the side and topped with diced red onions and tomatoes. How many restaurants will agree to that?  If you have not ever been to Square Cafe you must go. Don't miss this Pittsburgh gem."}
{"text":"I had the Brussel sprout hash with scrambled egg. It's was pretty good. Wait time for 2 on a Saturday was about 20 min. Servers were nice. Would definitely go there again. They have a big menu."}
{"text":"We lucked out on our timing for Saturday brunch here and did not have to wait for more than 5 minutes. If we were 20 minutes later I think we would have been waiting a while-which also helps with a positive review.  The place had a very friendly atmosphere, we had seats at the bar which kept things lively and ensured we had great service.  Husband is s coffee drinker and he had positive things to say. I think he also liked the square mug it came in (well....maybe that was more me than him-super fun and they sell them onsite).  He had the burrito, it was really quite good (but not outstanding for any particular reason). I had the eggs Benedict and they were quite delicious - would get them again. Also the menu is quite extensive-many options for all palettes.   We ended with a crepe with Nutella and bananas-great ending to a great meal!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast places in the city. Went with a group of six people with everyone getting a different meal and everyone loved it. I got the eggs with corn beef hash with a side of rye toast and a cornmeal pancake with banana and chocolate chips in it. All of it was great with my main meal being a perfect portion size. I was full but not stuffed. I have to stay the price was great apart from the one cornmeal pancake I got at I think $3.89 for one. But wroth it. I tried my girlfriends white bean hash skillet and it was really really good as well. This place is a must try for Pittsburgh!  It's clean and a nice relaxed feel with good service.   Only bad thing and it was not a big deal. The waitress did not offer fill up the bottomless coffee or our waters but since we did not ask it was not a big deal and she was busy."}
{"text":"The different eggs Benedict options they do as specials are amazing. Fresh, honest, homemade, local. The specialilty drinks including coffee and teas are very good.  Lemon ricotta pancakes are amazing. The menu changes, but you know that specials give you a taste of things all year round.  I loved the holiday season pancake: pumpkin, nuts, etc. Amazing.  THis place is worth the wait in line and worth your business regularly.   This restaurant has a good soul, in its people, its owner and most importantly in its food."}
{"text":"This place is very cute and has a nice diner vibe to it! My friend got the chicken pesto wrap and I got the breakfast burrito. Both very good dishes. The fries that came with the chicken pesto wrap were awesome--light, crispy, and full of flavor! My breakfast burrito was also great; it could've used a little more salt but other than that it was great!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty decent, but I don't get the hype (or the wait times). I didn't care for the regular coffee at all, and to me, that's a big part of the breakfast/diner experience. If you're going to brave the crowds anyway, try the crepes!"}
{"text":"Always solid food ... Wish it was a bit less expensive and had longer hours, but it's a great little place for breakfast.  The hot chocolate is amazing."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Square Cafe, considering the long line that's always out front. Overall, I was disappointed, especially after waiting outside in the cold for half an hour.   I ordered the Veggie Benedict. The hash browns were way too salty, the veggies were undercooked and bland, there was so little hollandaise sauce on the eggs that I couldn't even taste it, and the side salad greens were underdressed. I wanted to ask for more sauce, at least, but the server never checked in until we were nearly finished.  My husband had the Pulled Bacon and Sprouts. He said it was ok but the bacon was dry and so were the side salad greens. His coffee was also just ok.  The menu at Square Cafe is interesting, but the execution is poor. I much prefer Kelly-O's in the strip district - there are fewer menu options but everything always tastes great. They also usually have a wait, but the line moves much faster and the servers are totally on top of things."}
{"text":"Square has been a family favorite of ours for years. My parents will literally drive 2 hours to come here.   Our favorites are the Brussel sprout bowl-cheesy grits and brussel sprouts? Yum!! And the breakfast burrito. I normally order from their specials menu, and my favorite special has been the cinnamon roll pancakes. They are to die for!   The drinks here are fantastic, and I love love the square ceramic mugs. We all have our own set at our homes. I'm a chai fanatic, and theirs is delicious.   This place is super small, so it's tricky to get a table at peak times, but it's worth the wait. Great for kids too."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience at Square Cafe! The food here is great for breakfast and lunch.   It's pretty artsy in here; you can literally purchase the art off of the walls. The only downside to Square Cafe is how confined it is. There's always a wait, which is no big deal, but it's very packed once you do get seated.   Their menu is filled with so many different options - sandwiches, breakfast bowls, crepes, vegan options - everything!!  It's well-priced. Nothing too expensive. Worth every penny though no matter what you order.   Love coming here and would absolutely recommend it to a friend!"}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch.  Although they were busy, we got a table outside quickly.  The \"Monte Cristo\" (eggs and ham in French toast) was good.  The only downside was that it took a little long for our food to arrive, but the ambience made up for it."}
{"text":"I've had my eye on this little spot for a while and I finally got time to stop in today! Let me tell you! It's so amazing everything was wonderful from start to finish my latte, server and chicken asiago crepes were outta this world! You wolnt regret eating here."}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on a local PBS show.  On the show the restaurant looked great, the staff was excellent, it was family friendly and the food looked great, so I was looking forward to trying The Square Restaurant.    In reality the space is fine, the staff is great, it is very family friendly but the food isn't worth the hype.  We were greeted by a welcoming staff member and told where to sit.  Our waitress was  friendly and was at our table within a few minutes, if that.  I ordered  the Square Breakfast with coffee and orange juice and DH ordered  shrimp and grits with coffee.  Are beverages were brought to us, again, within minutes.  The coffee was served in big square mugs,  hot and had body  The orange juice was disappointing but the menu does not state it is fresh squeezed.  We received our selections within ten minutes.  My over easy eggs were medium well, the homefries were deep fried 1/2 inch potato squares, the ciabatta bread was very lightly toasted, not having any browning and the soy sausage consisted of two very dry sad 2 inch round patties.  My husband's grits were well cooked although not as creamy and buttery as they should have been with the shrimp unseasoned and to the side. This is  unlike the traditional dish when they are seasoned and served on top of buttery grits.  He was happy with the taste but they were not up to the standard shrimp and grits we've had in North Carolina for many years.    I'm very willing to pay the price for a good meal but in this case the meal price was far to high for what we were served.  The staff is friendly, the restaurant is very family friendly, the space is over the top noisy, at times making it difficult to have a conversation.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant unless you have young children and don't care that much about the food quality.  It's too bad as the staff is great and should be serving much better food for the service they give."}
{"text":"I went there with some friends for brunch and had an amazing experience.  We sat outdoors on a gorgeous Saturday noon.  I had a strawberry blueberry smoothie that was delicious, and they gave me an extra half cup when we accidentally spilled a little bit of it.  For brunch, I ordered a chicken and spinach crepe that was absolutely heavenly -- I ate all of it, and I normally have leftovers whenever I go out to eat.  The service was excellent and friendly, and the atmosphere was nice. I'd definitely come back to try other things on their menu, such as the green eggs and ham.  Maybe a little bit overpriced as some others have mentioned, but it didn't even cross my mind when I was there."}
{"text":"After being on the wait list for 30 min, we'd walked around the neighborhood to work up an appetite, as opposed to obsessively standing outside like most other people do, waiting to hear their name called. You just know this place has got to be worth waiting for!   Seating was cramped, but they we also very busy. Service was warm and never let our waters run out. They were quick with the check,  ever had us waiting after the first time!  :)  I ordered one plate of the protein breakfast, which was 3 eggs, choice of meat (I picked spicy sausage), and a cinnamon chocolate protein pancake.  Everything was delicious, perfect sized portions.  My partner ordered the BBQ pulled jackfruit/ fingerling potatoes/ mushroom scramble, and one SINGLE order of the PB&J pancake. The jackfruit is getting really popular as a pulled pork substitute in vegan cooking, so I was thrilled to see it here, being delicious!  My partner and I agreed the pancake could have been more peanut buttery, but we still loved it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is AWESOME! My husband and I eat here every chance we can!  The hubby is even willing to get up early, if I entice him with breakfast at Square!"}
{"text":"Two of us came in for a weekday lunch, looking for a break in our usual routine. And we found exactly this: a charming lunch menu with many vegetarian options and fresh ingredients. I loved the brie-and-apple grilled cheese, and my boyfriend enjoyed the enormous veggie burger. Neither of us ordered drinks, partially because the espresso drink prices were so expensive (like add a dollar to drink prices at Starbucks expensive).  I want to come back soon for brunch!"}
{"text":"Oh man, the pancakes are amazing. Fluffy, tasty, and served with a side of syrup. I tried the cinnamon bun pancake with the cream cheese icing. Fantastic. The pancakes were large and filling.   This is a rather small cafe that was busy and pretty loud. It's a pleasurable dining experience, where you can be in and out. I will certainly be back for more."}
{"text":"Good breakfast food on a great menu.  Very popular, especially with students from CMU.  Expect a wait, but not long, and the experience is worth it."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times, hands down my favorite brunch spot in the burgh.  The Food: It's the perfect mix of greasy spoon meets health nut. Everything uses simple but flavorful ingredients, with chocolaty to salty to savory.  The Tot Stuff is my favorite meal! The chorizo is also delicious.  They also offer a wide selection of specialty drinks from lattes to milkshakes.   The Staff:  No nonsense, quick, and they aim to please.  They always offer a coffee to go! Thy also let their staff practice a bit of autonomy in their dress/jewelry, which adds to the vibe.   The Ambience: Has the feel of a artsy, breakfast dinner.  The art in the walls is done by local artists and most is for sale! They also serve coffee out of really cool handmade coffee cups."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere that is very welcoming and new. The baristas are very personable and kind. The food is five star quality and the choices range from traditional to a milkshake with bacon. I got lemon-berry ricotta pancakes and they were very good. Prices aren't cheap but aren't expensive. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Stopped for a late lunch on a Monday. The menu is varied and I had a hard time choosing what to get. Though I really wanted to go for the lemon berry ricotta pancakes, I knew I had a long day ahead of me and decided to go for the more robust waffle biscuits and Brussel sprouts scramble. My companions had a salad and chickpea burger with sweet potato fries.   Our food came quickly which was awesome. My scramble was two biscuits in waffle form with a Brussel sprout and carrot hash topped with pulled bacon, scrambled eggs and asiago cheese. A little salad was served on the side   The biscuits especially were awesome and very dense. The pulled bacon was tasty but a bit on the salty side. The eggs were perfectly scrambled and the Asiago was an awesome touch. The meal was PLENTY of food for the price and I wasn't able to finish about 1/4 of the dish. Probably wouldn't reheat well so I didn't bother taking it home but I totally would get it again. Everyone else enjoyed their meal and felt the portions were plentiful as well.   Service was good, my coffee mug never got chilled or even close to empty. Coffee was tasty. I'll be back -- especially to try the pancakes!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch while in town visiting a friend! Little wait, but not long for a Sunday morning.   Matt was our server! Amazing! Super friendly, happy to be working, welcoming & attentive! Really just all around awesome.   Food was great! I personally got the veggie omelet! Amazing! Also the chicken sausage was pretty great too!! Menu had a wide variety. Tons of options for any tastes. Omelettes, crepes, pancakes, salads, sandwiches, etc...  This place is a great find & I'd suggest to anyone."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Square Cafe and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I ordered the Hoppin Johnny which consisted of black-eyed peas, rice, sauteed onions and peppers, greens topped off with two eggs over easy. It was delicious and completely unique in comparison to what I'm used to. The one thing I didn't like was how crowded the cafe was. However, I rather it be crowded so I know it's definitely worth the time and money than empty and a bit skeevy.  To sum it up, it's a great place to get breakfast/brunch and I'll definitely go back sometime soon."}
{"text":"Despite hearing good things about Square, I hadn't made the trek there in the many years I've lived in the East End. Along with a group of coworkers, we decided to pay a visit on a weekday morning for brunch, excited for an opportunity to do so on a rare free weekday. As mentioned by other reviewers, the ambiance is lovely, though it is (like many similarly billed brunch spots in the area) on the smaller side. We came in expecting a wait for our large group, but what I didn't expect was the annoyance that we encountered by more than one staff member regarding our group's size. When we first went to place our names in our a table for 10, our host responded with a sarcasm-laden \"Great.\" before she eventually told us that she would do the best she could to seat us in a timely manner (which, to her credit, she did). Our waitress was similarly annoyed while taking our drink orders as we all had squeezed into our little corner of the room, though she had relaxed by the time we went to order our entrees. I should mention, however, that we had a woman who appeared to be a manager stop by our tables to check in at a few points during the meal, which I appreciated.  As for the food itself, I got the Square Special, which is your standard eggs-meat-carbs brunch combo. I was easily able to substitute one of the specialty hotcakes (orange cranberry) for the standard buttermilk pancake, for a surcharge ($1.75, I think). Though my three pieces of bacon were thick-cut and cooked to a perfectly delicious crispy/chewy perfection, the rest of my meal was lackluster. My pancake was dry, as were my scrambled eggs (i.e. in the style of the powdered stuff). One friend got the Tot Stuff, of which I sampled a tot which was deliciously salty.   Overall, I was sadly underwhelmed by Square Cafe. Like other reviewers, I felt that while the price point wasn't dissimilar from other brunch spots in the area, the quality of my meal didn't match up to what I ended up paying. Additionally, though our waitress did a good job with our large group, the annoyance that accompanied our visit was disappointing. I absolutely understand that having such a large group in such a small space is difficult, but despite our offer to split into smaller groups in order to facilitate seating, we were faced with bad attitudes by more than one member of the staff. Of note--I, at least, wasn't aware until we got the check that they would not accept more than two credit cards per table (which, in the era of transaction fees and Venmo, is understandable for the merchant and workable for the customer). I don't anticipate that I will be returning to Square anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a hard review to write. I will start off with the fact that we're from Cleveland, so we only get to come to the Square Cafe a few times a year, but we have included it as our Sunday morning breakfast spot each time, so about 6 times in the past year. I've seen some changes in the food quality during that time, but maybe the past 3 times we've gone have just been off days for the cooks? I don't know. The previous visits, I could not say enough about the food, which is why we haven't given up on them. Our visit this past Sunday may have us trying out some new places on our next trip though. My boyfriend ordered the succotash hash, no egg since he tries to stay vegan as much as possible. I ordered the vegetable crepes. Our food came out, his hash was topped with eggs, we just scooted them off and he was left with a very small dish of Lima beans and corn with a few other vegetables mixed in. My crepes vegetables were barely heated. Raw onion is not appetizing at all. We left there and asked why?!? What happened to the place we visited a few months ago when we had yummy breakfast dishes and couldn't stop recommending it to friends?!  I think maybe we'll take a break for a bit and then try them again, so we're not going to break up with them just yet."}
{"text":"What can be said that hasn't already been said over and over by others? This is just the place to go! Friendly staff, welcoming vibe. Only issue is it can get crowded due to lack of space--but, hey--maybe that's part of the charm."}
{"text":"bustling place with great outdoor seating. had a really nice breakfast here. the menu says the veggie crepes are a favorite, but I think the scrambles are the can't-miss items. just wish they had better coffee (from one of the local roasters, for instance)."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite brunch spots in the city! They have a bunch of vegetarian and gluten free options to choice from. I always get their Brussel sprout hash that has bacon and cheese grits. Their pancakes are also really good."}
{"text":"Favorite Brunch in the 'Burgh.   Pumpkin Pancakes are worth a flight home (Although the Lemon Ricotta ones were pretty amazing as well). Bottomless coffee for 2 bucks is the best deal in town, and their tofu scrambles are a rare gem for vegan breakfasts.   Come early because the place fills up quickly! But make sure to get their seasonal specialities...they're usually the best bet and enjoy getting a fabulous meal for under 10 dollars.   I knocked a star down just because over the last few years they have changed the menu so much that I continue to be frustrated that some favorites of mine are now gone. Maybe less change is a good thing Square..."}
{"text":"This is one of those reviews where I really wish yelp would allow us to give half stars. I would like to rate Square Cafe a 3.5, because there have been a few disappointments for me. I know a few people who LOVE Square Cafe, but I've been there at least 10 times and have only been \"wowed\" once (ordered Nutella crepes with strawberries on the recommendation of the server). Every other time was just \"good.\" Not great, not terrible, not \"meh,\" but a place you would go to if you were in Regent Square area and wanted a decent breakfast.  Okay, let me just break it down as clearly as possible: PROS:  1. Crepes (most breakfast items actually) 2.Vegetarian options/healthy options 3. Milkshakes 4. Unlimited coffee in really cool ceramic mugs 5. Decor and cleanliness 6. Service (Usually really good, besides the time I brought my mom who was moderately impatient and you could tell the server wasn't having any of that.... which is somewhat understandable.)   CONS:  1. Chickpea sandwich/burger thing- It was dry and tasteless and kind of looked like canned catfood. This is actually the lunch I ordered that made me stop going to Square regularly.  2. Breakfast potatoes- They are also dry and boring, and definitely not worth the calories. I don't know how so many people enjoy them.  3. The wait time- Prepare to wait at least 20 minutes for a table for two most weekend days. If you're a table of 3+, you could probably be asked to wait 45 minutes or more. You'll also probably be outside, or squashed into their tiny entryway that was definitely not meant for patrons to be waiting for their tables.  Overall, check it out. You'll probably like it. Don't order that sandwich."}
{"text":"Square is one of my absolute favorite breakfast/brunch spots in the East End. I absolutely love the square coffee mugs, and I think the coffee tastes even better just because of these adorable mugs.   The atmosphere is cute, almost diner-esque, and they have an adorable litte bar when you can sit and order their signature lattes and a full breakfast/brunch/lunch if you like. They have a variety of table sizes considering the small size of the restaurant, and I have come here in groups of two, four, and six. There is plenty of room if you come early on a weekend morning.  I generally order their scramble special, as my favorite Hopple Popple is not on the menu year-round. They always have delicious things that they mix into scrambles on special such as avocado, house-made chorizo, brussel sprouts, etc. The veggie omelette is delicious as well, and my sister loves adding goat cheese to it to make it creamier and even more delicious.  I love coming to Square with my sisters when they come to visit. It's kind of our thing, and everyone loves it, even my picky eater sister. Though I'm not a sweet-in-the-morning person, my sister swears that the pancakes are out of this world.   The signature lattes/chais are great, and the barista can adjust any of them to your preference. It's always fun to try new things at Square! Plus, because their ingredients are so fresh, you don't leave feeling sick and stuffed."}
{"text":"Really, really good food.  Four stars because one time I went, ordered a milk, and it didn't taste right. They brought out another one and it was fine, though."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite, we go there whenever we pass through Pittsburgh, service friendly, new art every time, great funky fun atmosphere, best breakfast in Pittsburgh. We love the pancakes, ciabatta (amazing), home fries, and quesadillas. This time I tried the ranchero omelet and was disappointed to realize it's just a Denver omelet with salsa (a very good Denver omelet with great salsa). But after coming here for years, that's the only dish I haven't loved. The food is a good combination of hearty, flavorful comfort food that is creative enough to be interesting."}
{"text":"Yes!  All about Square Cafe.  It was crowded but they have a decent amount of space so I don't think our two-person table took us more than ten minutes to snag.  I did call ahead of time and they informed me they don't take reservations (this was a Saturday morning).  If the weather had been a tad nicer, I would have insisted we sit outside as there is just enough room on the sidewalks to eat and for people to walk by.  Food came out quickly ( I had Cinnamon protein-packed pancakes) and I really enjoyed the vibe of the staff.  There was art on the wall available for purchase - I liked that a lot.  Parking was rough for us to figure out since we don't live in that neighborhood but there are enough side streets to make do."}
{"text":"I love this place and have visited frequently to try their different menus. The Square Cafe has a seasonal rotating menu that uses mostly local seasonal ingredients. It is only open for breakfast and lunch, closing daily at 3pm. They have an awesome coffee bar with great specialty drinks, but no alcohol. Bloody Mary and Mimosa-seekers must go elsewhere.   This place is very accommodating for different dietary needs like vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free. Menu items that accommodate special dietary needs are clearly labeled, and many dishes can altered to fit your diet. I'm a pescatarian (vegetarian + seafood)  and while this place has absolutely delicious smoked salmon incorporated into most seasonal menus, I usually order vegetarian because the options are so numerous and interesting. They always have great scramble options mixed up with delicious fresh vegetables and cheese, and dishes usually come with a side of toast or mixed greens. The mixed greens don't really thrill me, so I usually substitute rye toast with no issues.   My favorite item on the menu is the nutella crepes with carmelized apples. My boyfriend and I split an order of these every time we come here. The crepes are perfectly cooked and extra thin, and the apples just blow me away. Make sure you order CARMELIZED apples though. Once I forgot that crucial qualifier and ended up with raw apples (even though this is not an option on the menu). They were not nearly as good--not even close--but I ate them and didn't say anything since it was really my fault for ordering wrong.   My only complaint with the square cafe is the prices keep creeping up every season. What started off as a place where dishes range from $8-$12 has quickly crept up in price to a place that ranges from $10-$15. Every season when they add a new menu, the prices go up ever-so-slightly. For a place that is only open for breakfast and lunch and doesn't serve alcohol, these increases are a little annoying and I have been going here less and less often. I hope the prices stabilize a bit so I can continue to frequent this place, but I'm fast-approaching the tipping point. I want to give this place 4--heck, even 5--stars, but the constant price increases are a huge problem for me."}
{"text":"Like the great Chuck D said \"Dont believe the hype\"  Square Cafe is situated in the bustling Regent Square area, sure to draw all the vegan-pesco-yuppielandia types. I dont mean that in a bad way, as they sure know their target market.   That being said, it was OK. I had a Chorizo sort of frittata thing. Chorizo can generally make anything awesome, but the meal was fairly bland. Pumpkin pancakes were decent, though I can really make them just as good out of some mix at home.  This place was packed, though we were seated very quickly. The service was quite good.   You can take my review with a grain of sea salt, as I am a breakfast snob. Call the whambulance."}
{"text":"Love it. Super cute, great menu, great location. My boyfriend and I live near by but we would still pick Square over any other breakfast spot in the area! We are fortunate that we go most on weekdays, because the weekends are extremely busy. Get there early :)"}
{"text":"Breakfast is just okay in my opinion. The wait is not worth it for overpriced food with disappointingly limp bacon. Typically, when I've gone, the bill for two people has always been at least $40. For less money and better food, without any of the pomp or wait, I would recommend checking out Nancy's instead."}
{"text":"Ate here a few months ago. Lemon ricotta pancakes were the bomb. Service was great. Nice breakfast spot."}
{"text":"This place is straight-up legit.  One sunny winter day a few weeks back, I was lucky enough to have off from work, allowing for a heavenly 2pm brunch with my favorite person in the world.  Our meal consisted of two items: feta cheese and veggie omelet and pumpkin pancakes.  Absolutely fantastic.  So freaking good.  Makes you want to slap yo momma.  Fast service, great pricing, and they bring out the ketchup and hot-sauce immediately after you ask for it.  Seriously, what more in life could you want?  The restaurant is bright and inviting.  Decor is nice, but the only thing that bothers me about this place is the fact that there are circle prints on the walls.  Doesn't seem fitting, right?  Whatever.  Keep making food like this and I'll keep coming back or more."}
{"text":"The food here here is decent, but I stopped bothering bothering due to extremely long waits, and getting snubbed by a frankly rude wait staff. Basically, we put our names in, stood about ten feet from the hostess (outside) and waited waited for 45 minutes to be told they never got our party and it would be another 30. Nope."}
{"text":"Square Cafe is in no way Square (usage circa 1940-1960).       Some items to note: 1.  I get up early and I like breakfast.  Get there early.  Like before 8 am early or you will be waiting.  The quaint interior has maybe 10 tables, but remember breakfast is quick, so turnover usually is fast.   2.  Listen to the server. There are always specials.  And the specials are always awesome. (as I post a picture of the brussel sprout hash ---menu item. Sorry :( ) 3.  Don't get overwhelmed with the menu.  It is slammed packed of breakfast-y goodness, sweet, savory, heavy, lite,  meat, vegan, you name it.  I ordered one pancake once (it wasn't on the menu) 4.  Take in the surroundings.  The tables are close, so you get the warm feeling of an overpacked living room on Christmas morning surrounded by your close and distant relatives.    From the mugs to the happy employees to piping hot coffee, Square is a great local joint.    Don't be a square and get there.  In the words of Huey Lewis \"It's hip to be Square.\"  I am done now."}
{"text":"Update 1st: I want to sincerely thank the management at Square Cafe, you responded to my review quickly and with concern. They also provided me with a gift card to try again which I look forward to doing in the near future. More updates to come!  Original: Too bougie to bear. That's my current take on the Square Caf√©. When it comes to food, I don't mind spending money. But when you walk away having spent $40 for two fair breakfasts - well, that's TOO MUCH. Such was our experience on Saturday. We arrived around 11am and expected to wait. The wait wasn't too bad, and once we were seated at the bar, the service was fine though a bit snooty. I ordered an orange juice and breakfast burrito and Jonathan D. ordered the Pumpkin Pancakes with a side of sausage. The orange juice was small enough that I could've obliterated it in one gulp, and his sausage was so pathetic looking it was hilarious. The main courses were decent, but in this city of endless brunch possibilities, decent no longer cuts it. I think Square was once the bastion of brunch in an otherwise brunchless town, but has failed to keep up with the incredible offerings our city now enjoys. Sorry, but #overit."}
{"text":"I love Square Cafe--haven't had a meal yet that I didn't like & their coffee is excellent.  I just wish that they were less expensive so I could eat there more often."}
{"text":"I _almost_ like the breakfast burrito here. The way it comes by default is a little sad: three eggs, saut√©ed peppers, onions, mushrooms, and one little tiny scoop of salsa on the side. However, if you modify your order a bit, you can make it much better. Order it with two eggs, potatoes (home fries), ham, extra salsa, and ask for some hot sauce. Too bad this isn't the default!  The coffee here is pretty good, and comes with free refills. Make sure to tell them you don't want cream if you don't plan to use it, otherwise they'll bring out a huge cup of it and it'll just go to waste.  Big plus: they use NoWait, so you can add yourself to the wait list before you even arrive for Sunday brunch. If you don't use NoWait, plan to wait for thirty to forty five minutes! Breakfast on weekdays is much more manageable and you can basically just walk in and sit down. They open early which is a plus!  PS: the pancakes are pretty good here too."}
{"text":"Bright uncomfortable sitting area. We get it, it's a happy place : -). The wait is horrible on the weekends. The food is excellent though."}
{"text":"1. Good food 2. Personalized service 3. Reasonable prices 4. Family owned with focus on other local small businesses. 5. Generous portions 6. Salmon Salad was filling 7. Sides are a good idea 8. Garbanzo Burger was good and filing 9. Scramble  Eggs were good. 10. Will surely go again if I am ever in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"we had breakfast at square cafe 3 (count 'em!) times while visiting pittsburgh and all three meals were great! my SO had the square breakfast with bacon and fruit in place of potatoes and the sub was graciously offered at no xtra charge. my vegan pancakes were brought to the table exactly as requested: nada on them. fresh fruit is really fresh; our server told us the fruit bowls are cut up every morning. coffee is served in quirky square (of course!) mugs. my ice tea was really good and I was offered a to go tall cup before we got the  check.  sweet.  our servers were all prompt, really pleasant and told us the list of specials before we had to ask. this is our fav goto breakfast place when  we return to the 'burgh. thanks, Square Cafe!"}
{"text":"Bobby gives 5 stars. I give a solid 4!  Stopped in this past Saturday around 230pm and I'm glad we did. Ive been wanting to try this place, but Bobby is not much of a brunch person so it's not very often we venture out before 4pm for a meal on the weekends.  We should have just sat outside and I would have given 5 stars if we would have, but we sat inside.  I have to deduct one star from my rating because although we were there not long before they were closing, the floors were absolutely filthy: dirt, footprints, used napkins, straw papers and food. All over.  I know they are busy throughout the day and might wait to sweep until it dies down, but there was literally so much crap around me I almost asked to be moved outdoors to eat.  There was only one other table seated inside besides us. It didn't bother Bobby though, so I sucked it up and we ordered our food that was nothing short of amazing.  I ordered the Tot mess with the vegetarian chili, scrambled eggs, sour cream and cheese all over tater tots.  It was a huge serving and it was everything I've ever hoped and dreamed of. Bobby ordered the Cinnabon pancakes....................... and they were even more amazing than they sound.  Our waitress was super friendly and took good care of us.  I ordered a Mallownut (toasted marshmallow and coconut!) latte on our way out and it was very good and very sweet.  Just how I like it.  I got the thumbs up to make a second, third and fourth visit to try some other things on their menu in the future so hopefully we will be back in time before it's too cold and we can eat outside on the adorable patio!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot! I love their classic buttermilk pancakes. They taste like something your grandma would put on the table. Only downside is the limited space and long wait on the weekends. I definitely suggest going early/avoiding peak brunch times, so you do not have to wait too long."}
{"text":"So I've only been to Square Cafe once...and maybe I had a bad experience or just chose the wrong items, but I doubt I'm gonna be heading back ever again.  I am NOT snobby about my food...especially breakfast food (if you give me decently cooked bacon & eggs, I'm a happy camper), but this food was severely lacking.    I ordered the Fennel Sausage & Ricotta Frittata, which was clearly not cooked to order.  It was rubbery and lukewarm.  It looked like it was cooked the day before, sliced up into individual orders, and heated in a microwave.  The WORST part, however, was the \"side\" it came with....a pile of lettuce (described as \"mixed greens\" on the menu).  Seriously, just a pile of lettuce.  No dressing...no additional veggies...nothing but a pile of lettuce. A guy next to me ordered the \"Chickpea & Tofu Hash\", who seemed like the type of person that might enjoy eating a pile of nondescript lettuce...but no, he just pushed that crap to the edge of the plate (like a kid who's trying to fool his parents into thinking he ate some of his veggies).  I mean, c'mon!!! I just paid $9.50 for a slice of day old frittata and a pile of lettuce?!?!  My boyfriend had the the Leek, Pancetta, and Mozzarella Omelet, which was OK enough.  It at least came with homefries (and not the lettuce), but they looked like they were heated from a frozen bag...nothing special, and definitely not worth the $9.50 price.  The coffee and service were good (only reason why I give 2 stars).  Maybe we just ordered the wrong things.  Maybe if I were vegeterian/vegan, I'd love this place.  I just do not understand why people wait here for hours on the weekends to overpay for subpar breakfast food.  I'd much rather wait in line at Pamelas and pay less!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Only had one napkin... & im a messy eater. I had to ask for a straw. Nothing major. Pleased with the service."}
{"text":"For me, this is a tough review.  We were seeking a step up from the traditional greasy spoon that permeates Pittsburgh, particularly for a joint that offers vegan options  and the Square Caf√© came up as top choice.  It definitely has a nice balance of healthy fare and alternatives that are a healthier slant on traditional breakfast fare.  Ambiance is wonderful.  Really bright and cheery on a blustery snowy Pittsburgh day.  The coffee was rather strong, but good and I loved the mugs that they are served in.  I imagine they are locally made.  Service was fine.  Friendly.  My hesitation is that I think it's a bit pricy for what it is.  Breakfast burrito with meat is $12 and doesn't include any sides.  Granted I didn't finish it because it's huge, but a side of toast or potatoes would have been nice.  Also, unfortunately, the scrambled eggs that were a dominant part of the burrito didn't have any kind of seasoning so the overall taste was bland.  Amish Cheddar was the cheese, and I forgot that the Amish tend to be pretty bland so it didn't add anything to the dish.  I did sample the pancakes, and those were pretty awesome.   I'm not sure that I would return for breakfast, but I would be open to giving lunch a try."}
{"text":"Favorite place for brunch!!  Never get tired of coming here.  The red velvet pancakes are a must if you happen to go when they're having them as a special."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly.  However, they allow pets. So, you will likely eat your food next to a begging barking dog. Also, there was HUMAN HAIR in my food. Did they bring me out another order? Yes. Was there hair in my food that horrified me? Yes!  Service also is normally great. Not today. Yes, and if you post something they do not like they attempt to get it removed. I'm glad I have multiple \"platforms\" .  Needs to be cleaned."}
{"text":"Worth the wait for Sunday brunch  I like to eat here after my Zumba class nearby. It was just me and a friend but the wait was 30 minutes. Square also seats the counter, so don't sneak up there unless you are called. Seating in general is tight, so get cozy and don't talk about private stuff. Actually this would be a great place to break up with someone... very public.  There are a ton of vegetarian options including jackfruit, Brussels sprout hash, and soy sausage. I like the pancakes best. You can get any pancake as a single if you want to try a few or can't eat a stack.  Also, their espresso beverages and milkshakes are amazing! You should splurge on them if you can."}
{"text":"Review update! I returned twice in the past month (yes, I'm obsessed) and tried their crepes as a brunch item, rather than their strictly breakfast items. Their asparagus and Bavarian ham crepe is incredible! The asparagus was prepared just right and the flavors all together was a party in a mouth. The asiago cream sauce was to die for as well. I basically licked the plate clean. Same goes for the chicken and wild mushrooms crepe as well. The same sauce was served with this crepe and the flavors were wonderful. Have to say my favorite out of the two was definitely  the asparagus and Bavarian ham crepe. Service is always awesome! And I just had to purchase one of the awesome mugs, $18 may be a little pricey for one- but they are hand made and unique ! This place deserves nothing less than 5 stars:)!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past two days. The food a amazing the protein pancakes were everything and then some. The staff was super friendly and easy going and quick to attend to me"}
{"text":"If you're the mood for a good ole homestyle breakfast, make your way to Square Cafe. Located in Pittsburgh's East End neighborhood, Regent Square, this cafe is serving up seasonal menu items using locally sourced ingredients. Be sure to get something off their espresso menu, caffeinated beverages are served in a beautiful mug."}
{"text":"The food may be ok here - but don't plan on getting a table anytime soon if you have more than 2 people in your party.  Not because they are so popular, but because they don't seem to understand how to efficiently seat people (speaking as someone who has worked as a restaurant hostess).  They take up big tables with small groups, which then leaves bigger parties waiting forever for a table.    At my visit, after watching how this went for more than 45 minutes, my party gave up and went elsewhere.  I wish I had never bothered to try this place, and I won't try again.  What a waste of time."}
{"text":"Maybe my favorite breakfast place in Pittsburgh, which given this city's obsession with breakfast foods, says a lot.  The interior is adorable, and its always busy, whether it is on a weekday morning at 8 AM or the weekend brunch crowd. Their coffee, something usually overlooked at these sorts of places, is awesome. So much better than what you get at Pamela's or Deluca's. And the food, OMG. Their Lemon Ricotta Pancakes are absolutely amazing. They are so different than anything that I have ever had. I crave them. Their cinnamon bun pancakes are also great.  One thing I LOVE about Square Cafe is that you can order individual pancakes so you can mix and match to get a breakfast instead of ordering one full order.  If you are in Pittsburgh for breakfast, you really should go. It is a treat!"}
{"text":"I've eaten brunch at Square Cafe more than at any other restaurant. They have delicious food. I'm a big fan of the Square Breakfast. Always full when I leave. Their coffee is tasty and strong. Servers are always friendly and helpful. Only downside is the long line."}
{"text":"I ate here this past weekend for brunch with three other dining companions.  We arrived around 10:30 and the place was packed forcing us into a bit of a wait.  The restaurant is fairly quaint with vividly colored walls and a bar on one side.  For brunch I decided upon having the andouille sausage with jalapeno jam with a cup of coffee.  The coffee came out and was not that great but was in a very cool glazed pottery cup which they seemed to also be selling.  Thankfully the meal was much better than the coffee with a big piece of andouille sausage, two eggs over easy and grits with some jalapeno jam dabbled over the sausage and onto the plate.  The jalapeno jam was not what I was expecting as it did not have any spice that I could detect but it was still delicious with a somewhat sweet taste.  I ended up mixing all of my food together which gave it all a great taste.  I was also able to try the shrimp and crab omelet which had a nice remoulade but a bit too fishy of a taste for my liking.  The Brussels sprouts and bacon hash ordered by another dining companion looked very good and I am looking forward to coming back in order to try it.  The bottom line for me is that this place is great and I will definitely be back in the future.  It is a unique place which has some great food combinations that I have not seen elsewhere."}
{"text":"I just love Square Cafe.  It is consistently wonderful. Maybe because I love going out for breakfast.  Maybe because they have such original choices on the menu. Maybe because it's in Regent Square, an area that reminds me of the old nabe in Brooklyn.  Or maybe it's the coffee served in the square mugs.  Whatever the reason, I always look forward to a Square Cafe meal.  Last time I was there, I had the root vegetable hash and eggs.  Fantastic.  When I'm there, I always wonder what a Square Cafe dinner menu would look like.  But that's just me daydreaming.  I already know it would be great.  Love you Square Cafe!"}
{"text":"I visited for brunch at 1pm today with a friend.  Although they don't accept reservations or use No Wait, they got us in surprisingly quickly (in 10 min., despite an estimate of 20-30 min.).  We were seated at the table closest to the door, but I found it quite warm, and didn't feel chilly at any point, despite the constant stream of customers.  Between us, we ordered the following: Sun dried tomato scramble with goat cheese and spinach (me), brussels sprout hash (my friend), side of bacon (split), and two 16 oz specialty drinks (regular cinnamon bun latte for me, decaf gold star (?) latte for my friend).  The food came out quite quickly--less than 10 min. after ordering, I believe--and our waitress was quite efficient, despite being one of only two working with a large crowd.  Generally, we were pleased with the quality of the food.  My one criticism was that the ingredients could have been more evenly distributed throughout the scramble--some pieces consisted only of egg, and all of the goat cheese was concentrated in one area.  Once I mixed up the ingredients, the flavors and textures combined, complementing one another nicely.  The addition of some hot sauce, salt, and pepper enhanced them even more.  The spring mix was served with my entree undressed, but I used the orange garnish to add some juice, which dressed it up nicely.  The bacon was cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of crunch and give.  Finally, my latte was just sweet enough (not overly so), with a good milk:coffee ratio, rounding out the savoriness of the scramble and bacon.  Although I didn't sample my friend's dish or latte, she enjoyed them, as well.  As others have mentioned, I felt that the portions were on the smaller side, esp. given the price (our check came to $34).  Fortunately, I had a city dining card for this place ($10 discount), but even so, after tip, I paid close to $30.  For this reason, I'm tempted to knock off half a star.  However, because I liked the vibe, was pleased with the quality of the food and the service, and appreciate the fact that this place offers several healthy, vegetarian, and GF options, I'm awarding an even 4 stars."}
{"text":"Creative vegan dishes with a great diner like atmosphere. The service was friendly and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Square cafe is awesome for breakfast. The place usually has a line, but I've never had to wait long.  Pricing is good.  I've had the pancakes, waffles, and omelettes. It's tough to decide on which is the best."}
{"text":"Simply and honestly one of the best meals I've had in recent memory. White bean \"hash,\" really a sort of breakfast cassoulet, w/ pancetta, mushrooms and a garlic/cream gravy. Wanted to lick the pan, but my kids threatened to leave. Had to settle for toast mop-up. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Our party of 2 went in on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch. It was a nice day and there were many people sitting outside, but we opted for a table inside. Service was prompt and fuss free. We ordered the Brussels sprout special bowl, a meat omelette, and a single lemon ricotta pancake. Everything was delicious - i like that the omelette came with a side salad instead of potatoes. The Brussels sprout bowl in particular was amazing - everything combined together beautifully. Will definitely be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"You know, I'd seen this place many times 'cos I have a membership at the Regent Square Theatre.  Anyway, after a Halloween party last night, I wasn't in the mood to cook breakfast, so Rick and I headed over here.  It's a nice neighborhood place with an extensive and somewhat eclectic menu.  Some of the more unusual dishes include a mushroom tart and something called a \"Hopple Popple\".  Heh heh, not for this girl.  After last night, Susan wanted her eggs, meat, and cakes so she ordered the Square Breakfast with scrambled eggs, chicken apple sausage and buttermilk pancakes (pump that insulin, Susan, pump!).  Hey, after last night, I was hungry and I wanted to chow!  I'll have to try this place for lunch sometime."}
{"text":"Staff very attentive. Food cooked well with fresh ingredients. Price point perfect for what one orders. Took off one star because space has some creepy photos on the wall for sale, I guess a local artist."}
{"text":"There is always a long line but the food is worth the wait. The pancakes are truly delicious and the bacon was cooked just right. They have custom milkshakes that are simply amazing."}
{"text":"Good food that caters to a wide range of tastes and dietary restrictions! I personally enjoy their omelets the most - always stuffed with cheese or veggies (or whatever you like) with the usual homefries and toast on the side. Solid. I have tried the crepes and french toast as well and they are delicious! Portions are for the most part pretty filling, although if you're willing to leave room, their specialty lattes are incredible! Hot drinks also come served in beautiful mugs that can be purchased to take home :)"}
{"text":"I can't even say enough good things about Square Cafe! Sherree and her staff are fabulous. I usually visit on a weekend morning, so it is packed. The staff is super helpful and work diligently to ensure every guest is seated in a timely manner.   Then, once you are seated the fabulous service continues until you walk out of the door. They are friendly and efficient which makes the experience even better.   The food! Oh gosh, the food. I haven't had one dish I dislike! However, I HAVE to get a pancake with whatever I get. They are TOO good!! I love how the menu changes with the seasons so you always have different options. It is especially helpful since everyone seems to be a regular! The coffee is also delicious as well as the specialty coffee drinks.   I HIGHLY recommend going to Square Cafe at least once every weekend :)"}
{"text":"Square cafe is one of our favorite spots in the East End. It's an upbeat, clean, refreshing looking diner, with new takes on your grandaddy's style diner.   We don't get a chance to come here as often as we'd like as they are usually extremely busy and we don't normally have the time to wait too long. But today we had a Groupon(look to see if it's still available: $50 voucher for $32) and we had nothing else to do this morning.   We tried the ahi tuna bowl and a classic favorite of mine the breakfast burrito along with a couple specialty coffees.   The vibe here is so nice and friendly, it's such an enjoyable meal Everytime we come. Check it out while the Groupon is available!"}
{"text":"I love brunch.  As far as I'm concerned, if you're a brunch place, you're already starting ahead.  But I love weird brunch and my husband is more of a meat and potatoes kind of guy.  Enter Square Cafe, which has become our go to brunch place because I can get a tofu scramble and he can get all the meat and potatoes that his fat heart desires!  Square Cafe, as some have noted, is in a fairly small space, and gets crowded on weekends.  That being said, in the 10 or so times I've been here, I've never had to wait more than 30 minutes for a table.  Their specialty lattes and milkshakes are not to be missed.  I've dinged them one star for the food, which is typically quite good, but I've had a couple \"misses\" from their menu (as excited as I get for gluten free pancakes, these are not the best, fairly dry and leathery).  There are plenty of VERY good menu items, and they do rotate seasonally.  Right now, I'm all about the Cold Weather Crepes, which are full of Gruyere and butternut squash, or the brussel sprout hash, served over some gooey-amazing cheese grits.  Finally, as busy as they get, I've never had anything other than good service here, and typically it's excellent.  Every so often, the coffee bar gets backed up and you might get your food before that delicious fancy latte that you ordered.  That's not a big deal to me at all. If Maddie is your waitress, you'll be in great hands!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh! It has such a cool atmosphere, and the food is absolutely delicious. The lemon blueberry ricotta pancakes were fantastic. I also recommend the white chocolate ginger milkshake, which I got the last time I was here. I'll always make the trip out to Regent Square when I'm in town to get in some good, healthy, vegetarian food."}
{"text":"This is a great local business.  The menu changes with the seasons and everything is so fresh. I love the latte selections! Today my husband had short rib Benedict over grits. He said it was amazing.  I had the square breakfast with bacon. Simple, but tasty."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had Sunday brunch last week. We ordered to-go, thank goodness, because the line was clear out the door and PACKED. I ordered the breakfast burrito and she had a cheeseburger.  The breakfast burrito came with egg and chicken apple sausage. They toast the outside (maybe a little too much), and sprinkled it with spices on the outside which was unique. It came with pretty standard salsa, not much spice at all. All in all if say it was just ok.  Now the cheese burger looked great. Hearty bun, nice big patty, and fresh lettuce and tomato. My daughter sad it was delicious!  Pretty good overall, would recommend."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Square Cafe and bring all of our out of town guests here! We impress them with how awesome Pittsburgh is when they experience the quality of food at Square Cafe. The specials are often incredible, so be sure to look into them. On a nice day, it's a great spot to sit outside and drink some iced coffee. I'd rather eat here for breakfast than anywhere! I may even need to go tomorrow now that I'm thinking about it..."}
{"text":"Square Cafe is one of my favorite brunch spots. The menu is extensive, unique, and vegetarian-friendly, and they almost always have fun daily specials - this is not your typical pancake-and-eggs place. I dined there the last two weekends and some of the specials we ordered were deep-fried pierogies with cajun ranch and German chocolate pancakes with a mind-blowing coconut creme sauce. I personally love the brussel sprout hash, the vegetable crepes, and the bacon.  That being said, there is often a long wait to be seated on weekends (a testament to how good it is, make sure your whole party is present or else you'll wait longer) and the service is often spotty. There's one server (I don't know his name but he's been there for a while and has lots of tattoos) who is fantastic. However, this past weekend, we had another server and it was pretty terrible - she was basically MIA and could not answer any of our questions. The worst part is that I made a slight special request to my dish (asked for a certain sauce on the side, which I've done countless times) - my meal arrived without it, I asked for it again, there was lots of back and forth with significant delays, she said she'd place the order, only to return 15+ minutes later with no sauce and no apology. I asked for sour cream instead and had to wait another 5 minutes, by which point everyone else had long finished eating. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Square Cafe has been one of my favorite brunch spots for years. I don't live in the area anymore, so last Sunday I was pretty stoked when my friend asked if I wanted to get SC post-workout grub and a latte for the 1.5 hour drive home.  During my visit, I ordered the tandoori jackfruit bowl with two fried eggs, a cinnamon (bun) protein pancake, and the Smokin' Mocha to wash it all down. The bowl was loaded with huge chunks of jackfruit, diced sweet potatoes, sliced mushrooms, and scallions all tossed in smokey tandoori masala spices - which was perfect on it's own, but even better with the runny egg yolk from the two fried eggs I added. The cinnamon protein pancake was the size of the plate, fluffy, and topped with a generous smear of cream cheese glaze. The Smokin' Mocha (chocolate, spiced brown sugar, and cayenne pepper) was sweet and spicy and perfect to sip on while waiting outside on a cold day for a table. I love chili and chocolate together, so I was immediately sold on this before I even tasted it. The portions are always bigger than I remember. Our entire meal was under $40.  The wait for a table on a busy day is always estimated to be 20 minutes, but is never more than 15 (if that). Our service was great, too, of course. No matter how packed the house is each time I've visited, the staff keeps it together and never seems to miss a beat. The friendly fellow who waited on our table was prompt and a pleasure to have as our server.    The menu changes seasonally, so there is always new stuff to try each time I return (I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the lavender, white chocolate, coconut latte they had on the menu a few seasons ago makes a comeback). The atmosphere is pretty laid-back and the service is always good. I never get tired of eating here and appreciate that the menu caters to a lot of dietary preferences."}
{"text":"The menu is filled with interesting options from omelettes to pancakes with great variations. I miss the jalape√±o grits that was previously on the menu but other than that I've never had a complaint. The servers are friendly and kindly accommodate the messiest of families... Like mine. I can't recommend a better breakfast on the east side of town."}
{"text":"So I used to think Coca Cafe was the greatest brunch that ever there was. However, I am delighted to be proven wrong by Square Cafe. First time there (on a Sunday) our wait was less than 20 minutes, which I'd call pretty good for Pittsburgh. Our waiter set us up immediately with coffee.  Let me just say - I am SHOCKED by how wonderful, and well-thought-out their menu is. As in, I cannot wait to go back and try every single item. I ordered the chicken and mushroom crepe, and it was perfect. My friend (from New Mexico) got the southwestern hash and had only the highest praise. My gluten free husband got an egg dish, and a side of gluten free fig pancakes, and rhapsodized about them.  Square has unique (nonalcoholic) coffee mixed drinks! They have crepes, eggs, benedicts, pancakes, TONS of vegan and gluten free options.  Honestly, do yourself a favor and get yourself there! So worth a trip!"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot in Regent Square that serves breakfast all day and fresh diner/lunch items. This place is gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan friendly as well. You can order a lot of additions to your meals with a nice a la carte menu.   My mom loves the gluten free pancakes (made from buckwheat), omelettes, and pretty much all of the sides.   In terms of food allergies, there are quite a few options no matter what your allergy is. I stuck to the fresh salads and was pleased to find out that a few of their salad dressings are soy-free. Those of you with soy allergies know how rare this is. I absolutely loved the mixed green salad with strawberries and balsamic vinaigrette.   Give this place a try but be prepared to wait during the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"Yum! I've never had a bad meal here. My go-to is the veggie wrap, which is always fresh and delish, but sometimes I'll switch it up for Nutella crepes, which is as amazing as it sounds! Our organization has its board meetings here, and they're always well attended because everyone loves the menu.  love the Square !"}
{"text":"I had heard really good things about this place, and so was pretty excited to meet here with friends for breakfast this morning. I ordered the 'Square Breakfast' which is 2 eggs any way, choice of meat, and either a buttermilk pancake or home fries with toast. I ordered my eggs scrambled, with ham as the meat, with a pancake. They bring out ONE undercooked, sunny-side up egg, bacon, and the pancake. The server was gone before I could question my order, so I ate it anyway, since I was starving. It wasn't until I got home that I realized I only got one egg instead of the two promised on the menu, and 2/3 items were incorrect. For 9.50$, I was expecting way better service and at least the proper type and amount of items I paid for. I feel pretty cheated. Sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"Our server was great, and the ambiance was fantastical. This brightly colored gem set the tone for our last day in Pittsburgh. We dined on a Sunday afternoon and expected to wait as the line was out the door. The 20 mins wait wasn't terrible and we were seated during the window. I choose the Brussel Sprout bowl, Lemon Berry pancakes which was so good and bottomless coffee (which they give you a to go cup of when you leave!) Our server was great and gave excellent honest reviews of the food. I'll definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"The Monday after Christmas was rather busy, but we had good service, good food, and pleasant service. As I currently live in the Baltimore-Washington area, I thought the prices were reasonable and appreciated the breakfast menu moving beyond eggs and pancakes and other generic \"Eat and Park\" kinds of food (not that there is anything wrong with that). I had polenta cakes, sauteed butternut squash, and caramelized pears with a side of chicken sausage. Pretty good stuff! I thought the coffee was pretty good too for drip coffee, despite what some of the other reviewers have mentioned. We liked William our server, Bonnie the owner and the rest of the friendly staff who were very welcoming to a couple of out of towners. Thanks for a good meal before we hit the turnpike."}
{"text":"Oh, Square Cafe, you make it SO hip to be square!  I absolutely adore this place for weekend brunch! While I can't say that I've tried any of their other fare, their brunch is just so fabulous that I'm not sure I can come back for anything but. I've been here a few times (with a Groupon once - which they were kind and accommodating with) and ordered several different items and everything has been delicious. Highlights include their custom two-flavor milkshakes (I always choose peanut butter and banana - yum!), the breakfast sandwich with seisage, and the seasonal pancakes (both the lemon one I had in the summer as well as the pecan? or pumpkin? one i had in the fall were amazing). It seems they've mastered both the savory dishes as well as the sweet, which is a rare talent for a place that's fairly inexpensive. Boy, I get hungry just THINKING about Square Cafe!   The prices here in general are pretty standard for breakfast fare (about $10-15), so no complaints there. I love their efficient staff that always seem to know how to hustle and get the job done, despite the fact that it's Hangover Hour (aka any weekend before 1pm). I don't think I've ever had that awkward waiting time between finishing my meal and waiting for my check at Square Cafe. Only downside is that it's definitely not a calm and relaxing environment - people are always rushing about, but I find that somewhat energizing.  Also, every time I come here I want to get one of their mugs! I believe all the pottery and glass sold there is made by local artists, so I definitely support that. (Yelp Shops Local, right?!)"}
{"text":"Delicious and creative dishes!! I highly recommend the roasted veggie Benedict. Just be prepared to wait a long time for a table on weekends."}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast in the 'burgh!  They have lots of Southern-inspired breakfast items (hey, the South does have the best breakfast in all America) like cheese grits, biscuits and gravy, and andouille sausage.  Their eggs have a nice flavorful yolk, and they're always cooked perfectly.  The coffee is fantastic, and the service is prompt and friendly.  For you veg-heads and health-conscious people out there, Square Cafe has a variety of delicious omelets and breakfast features like butternut squash hash. Their menu changes from time to time, which keeps ordering interesting.  I've also recently forayed into their lunch items with the wild mushroom gnocchi, which can only be described as sublime.    Square Cafe is pretty popular, so there can be a wait (5-15 minutes, usually).  Just grab a cafe au lait and chill out until your table is ready.  Then be prepared to have your culinary world rocked!"}
{"text":"Five stars all the way.  This place has so many amazing breakfast options that I am always excited to go back.   On my last trip, I had the short rib benedict, which was every bit as delicious and hearty as I wanted it to be.  A fair serving of meat and caramelized onions on top of nicely textured corn fritters and under top perfect eggs.  I got the hollandaise on the side because I don't like too much of it, but it was delicious as well.  The side of greens needed a bit of dressing, but that was my only complaint.  I didn't even mind paying $18 for breakfast, which is saying something about this place.   You get what you pay for - and you get a top notch breakfast here."}
{"text":"Our server, Joe, went above and beyond with suggestions today! He suggested a lemon pancake with blueberries, and much out of my comfort zone I went with this suggestion. It was easily one of the best pancakes I've ever had! The wait was only 10 minutes, but the service and food would've been worth a longer wait!"}
{"text":"I really like Square Cafe. It can be a long wait on the weekends (in the winter especially because they lose all of the outdoor options) but the winter/summer menu switch is wonderful. I usually get their breakfast menu options because the few lunch options I have tried are the reason I can't give a full five stars. In my opinion the lunch options just don't match the tastes offered on the breakfast menu and aren't really inspired cooking. I will recommend trying their specials and it is good to remember that you can order their sweet specials as a half order to share since they are almost always too sweet to eat a full serving alone. The coffee and free Wi Fi is pretty nice too.  Sometimes the servers at the tables can be a little flakey, but you will also find really attentive servers too so I feel like you can't hold it against the whole staff when one of the servers is having an off day. The main thing about all of the staff is that they feel like real people, and you will never once confuse them for an automated restaurant-o-bot who just goes through the motions."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast at this cafe near Frick Park. The range of menu choices is wider than at most such breakfast and brunch cafes and everything was fresh and well prepared. The staff is friendly and the place has a nice neighborhood feel. Moreover, you can walk off all those calories in nearby Frick Park."}
{"text":"My friend and I have been trying to come to Square Cafe for a year.  Last year, she made a reservation for my birthday, and when we called to verify, they said they couldn't guarantee us a seat.  Uh... what is the point of a reservation then?  We finally tried Square Cafe for the first time a few weeks ago.  I ordered a breakfast burrito, known as Uncle Charley's Hot Sausage Breakfast Burrito ($10.99), and my friend ordered the leek, asparagus, and cheese frittata ($9.29).  My breakfast burrito was good and tasted delicious, but the portion was very small for the price.  I ate the entire thing with no issues, and I weigh just over 100 pounds.  My friend's frittata wasn't very good, though, and the side of grits she ordered were just ok.  The food was good but not notable enough for me to be dying to come back.  Our server was a nice guy who explained the menu really well.  When he brought over the bill, we found out there was a pay it forward chain going through the restaurant.  We paid it forward in the server's tip, but it's cool that this place is into that kind of thing.  The ambiance is good!  A big problem:  It was really cold in the restaurant because despite having double doors, they propped the second set of doors open, which let all of the seventeen degree air into the space.  This was the difference between 3 and 4 stars for me.  I cannot enjoy a meal when I'm cold.  I really wanted Square Cafe to be the trendy cafe where I could regularly enjoy brunch, but in the end, it's just ok.  I would come back if someone suggested it, but I don't think I would come back here on my own."}
{"text":"YES YES YES!!! I love it, this place is very hip, as you walk in there are these very bright colors on the wall, Blue, Green, and Orange! There is a bar with about 10 stools and plenty of seating inside and a few tables outside. The staff is very friendly and know how to wait tables etc.. I got a glass of whole milk and an order of french toast with caramelized apples and whipped cream on the side, I also put some peanut butter on them! This french toast was so yummy! Challah bread mmmm."}
{"text":"Another fun find due to a groupon offer.  The food was fantastic.  I had the quinoa lima bean dish which has an over easy egg on top.  Unbelievably good   I am looking forward to going back.  The restaurant itself was cramped, and it looks like it is usually very busy.  It is so cramped that a guy getting out of his seat hit my arm which was holding the coffee cup from which I was drinking.  It jammed the coffee cup against my lip and spilled some coffee.  So be careful!!"}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast and lunch - service a little slow and little pricy for such basic ingredients."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here at the Square Cafe having a wonderful dish of corned beef with fingerling potatoes and eggs over easy and a sense of  redemption . Allow me to explain.Two weeks ago I ordered one of their signatures dishes, pulled pork Benedict and it was just so so.The problem was with the pulled pork, which was generally tough and hard to chew.i don't know if it had been overcooked or reheated but it left me wondering if  the Square Cafe had started resting on its laurels as can happen with very popular restaurants . Based on today's meal I would say  the pulled pork was a one-time misfire . Square Cafe is redeemed in my book!"}
{"text":"UPDATE 3/17/17: Ate at Square for the first time today for the first time since I've had increased dietary restriction. Our waitress had great knowledge of the menu's specifics and was willing to make alterations for me if needed. My only complaint is that I asked for no onion in my scramble, and there were two tiny bits of onions in the scramble... I know I'm being picky here, but it could have been an issue for me if I did not see spot them and ate the onion. I know Square will read this review and take extra care in the future. Regardless, I was content with the meal I received and it made me and my body happy! Keep it up, Square Cafe.  Perhaps my favorite breakfast place in Pittsburgh, Square Cafe is a delicious, family friendly brunch and breakfast location. The menu is diverse, appealing to more traditional American grease breakfast fans, but also to the more health conscious and dietarily restricted. Square Cafe even manages to successfully craft dishes that fuse traditional breakfast items like eggs and bacon with less traditional items like brussel sprouts and braised leeks (try the Brussel Sprout Hash).  They usually have two special dishes at a time, and switch them up every few weeks. One tends to be an egg centered dish, and the other a griddle pastry dish. They once had a delicious \"Green Eggs and Ham\" special that featured basil pesto with eggs and ham. I had no idea that the two would mix so perfectly! If you vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, or have other dietary restrictions, fear not: the menu has items for you, and the staff is more than willing to accommodate your needs.   Waits can be long, but the surrounding area of Regent Square has pretty neighborhoods to explore on foot as you wait in queue, or feel free to get one of their assorted beverages in their signature clay mugs as you wait!"}
{"text":"A gem of Regent Square, Square Cafe always delivers.  I've now been here several times since moving to Pittsburgh, and it very quickly became one of my favorite places for brunch.  The scallion and goat cheese frittata is a must try; the fennel sausage adds a bit of bite to the otherwise rich dish.  The seasonal specials, like the fresh berry and cream crepe, also highlights the cafe's utility of fresh, local ingredients.  Be prepared to wait on the weekend, but also know that it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Came for Sunday brunch and was anticipating a busy crowd, slower service, louder than normal ambiance, yet I still wanted my food to come out in a reasonable amount of time (less than 45 min) and for the quality of the food to be good. Got seated quickly, but our service was slow and inadequate. Server refused to give us bread options for our sides and rather enjoyed saying he was either out of that option or they didn't have it. No wheat, English muffins, or sourdough toast-Really?! Ran out of orange juice too. Coffee was mediocre. Waited 50 minutes for our food while watching our server blatantly ignore our table. Had to ask host twice for refills. Got up and tracked down our server to see where our food was-he ran to the kitchen and came out 10 minutes later with our food in tow. Food was warm but my salmon omelet was inedible...tough brown pieces of salmon inside. Potatoes looked to be out of a bag. Green eggs and ham basic and no taste of pesto as advertised. Server made no attempt at noticing us picking at our food and choose to continue to ignore us along with remedy the situation. Won't be back.  Prices are a bit over the top too. $4 for a side of potatoes?!?! $5 for one pancake?!?! Not worth it. Go down the street to the small bfast spot or even across the street to D's instead."}
{"text":"Menu has changed, they no longer have our fave items like the Benedict, corn beef hash, asparagus omelettes, etc. Our waiter and breakfast burritos were awesome though! However, the woman who brought our food out was extremely rude. Didn't grab her name, but she has tattoos on her arms, wears glasses, short blonde hair, and is quite fat. She slammed my fianc√©'s food on the table and then slammed my hot plate of food on my hand and didn't even apologize. Instead, she rolled her eyes and quickly walked away. Seriously? We just got off a 13hr shift saving lives and we don't treat people that way ever...and still held our tongues because she looks psycho. No one deserves to be treated that way, Ever. Just chill crazy lady, it was only 8am! What a bad way to start your day. I kinda feel sorry for her now. Womp womp"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots in Pittsburgh. Go early and you'll get a seat, this place fills up. The lemon ricotta pancakes are a dream and I love the funky vibe of this place."}
{"text":"Great brunch but didn't live up to the hype for me.  When we arrived around 1PM, they quoted an hour long wait for a group of 5 and it only ended up being a 30-minute wait, which was good news.  Atmosphere and service were awesome and the menu was very vegetarian friendly which was perfect for the group I was with.  I really can't say enough about the service.  They were very attentive, and we were seated outside where I often think service can be a little slower and less attentive.    I ordered the oatmeal pancakes with the peach compote and was a little disappointed based on previous reviews.  Ridiculous, I know, but they were too much like dessert for me and there just wasn't enough oatmeal in the pancakes.  Having said that, they were tasty just not what I had anticipated.  I also sampled the tomato bisque and pesto and fresh mozzarella grilled cheese.  Both were good but just didn't live up to my high expectations.  Still, one of the better brunches in Pittsburgh and I'll go back again to try something else from the menu."}
{"text":"We had about a 40 min wait for 3 people on a Saturday morning, which seemed reasonable. Their pistachiOMG shake was really nice. Be careful if you're getting the turnt turtle - it's really hot.   I tried the creamy chicken crepe, which was brilliant, and the Chocolate chip protein pancakes, which was ok. We had a really long wait of about an hour after placing our order."}
{"text":"What a great place to go. I have only been here during the week and not normally first thing in the morning but they are always busy. We have never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for a table so you can definitely get in and out if you have an hour to spare. The menu is huge and the portions are large.  I know breakfast food does not always travel well but you will likely need a to go box. Don't think that you are going to get out of here without spending at least $10 but I still think it is worth it. The other nice thing about this place is that they offer vegan and gluten free options."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh! Not only is the service amazing but the cafe makes every meal with love and with the customer in mind. I wrote an awesome essay about this joint for my food writing class and the owner was so sweet in giving me feedback. Couldn't help but write a quick review on here! Keep up the great work :)"}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend and we walked from her house down to the Square Cafe for breakfast one morning. Yum! The coffee was in big, square pottery mugs, the food was delicious and the prices are reasonable.   Their website says they're only open for breakfast and lunch and that they close at 3 daily."}
{"text":"Had a great brunch experience at Square Cafe last weekend. My friend and I went on a Saturday around 1:00PM. We didn't have to wait more than 15 minutes for a table - we asked for \"first available\" and were seated outside. I ordered the Purple Haze latte and it was amazing! Definitely could taste the cayenne pepper but it was not overpowering. For brunch I had the Veggie Benedict and it was delicious.   Everything was great and I can't wait to go back and try another dish!"}
{"text":"2.5 square encased stars.  This morning I splurged on a $9 vegan breakfast burrito and here's what I have to say about it:    * Portion was huge. * Potatoes were nicely spiced and perfectly cooked. * Too much \"chorizo\" and not enough veggies or avocado in the burrito. * Chiorzo a bit heavy on the cumin making for a powdery spice mouth feel. * Salsa was not very flavorful, mostly tomato. * Not enough salsa to sufficiently moisten the burrito. * Salsa served in disposable ramekin. Needless waste. * Franks Red Hot, yes! * A fair attempt but definitely missing something. Roasted garlic and/or fresh cilantro could really set this thing off. Ooh, and pineapple!   Place was pleasantly bright with uplifting decor. Service was absolutely good. Interesting \"Choice\" of teas (Choice brand). I will probably try some sides a la carte next time."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Expect a small, packed dining area, with a line going out the door (dress for weather)...suck it up and wait,  it's worth it! That is, if you're looking for some creative dishes of flavor magic. These foods are DIFFERENT and I mean in a good way. I got some breakfast dish with cheesey grits, brussel sprouts, pancetta and eggs...it was perfection and who would have thought of brussel sprouts for breakfast?  This place."}
{"text":"Very solid breakfast. I'm not a big fan of waiting, so I came on a weekday before a golf outing. Everything I had was on point. Eggs, hot sausage, Lemon berry pancake. I live in Green Tree, and I prefer Gab n' eat or the Dor-Stop, but I'm sure I'll be back here occasionally."}
{"text":"We ordered the latke lox benedict, ranchero scramble, and the Chocolate chip protein pancakes. The best was the latke lox benedict, it was absolutely delicious. The pancakes and the scramble were good but not particularly special.   We also ordered the oh snap! latte and the matcha peacha smoothie. The smoothie was very flavorful but very thick and leaves a dryish aftertaste. The latte was excellent. Not too sweet with a nice hint of nutmeg and gingerbread.   Environment and ambiance was cute and quite busy. Would come here again!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for breakfast. If you haven't been you simply must. It's consistent, delicious, and a staple in my week. I usually get the same thing but really when I branch out I am always happy!"}
{"text":"I had brunch here with friends a few weeks back, and overall it was a nice experience.  We only had to wait about five minutes to be seated.  I ordered the omlet ranchero.  It came with toast and homefries.  I stuck with water, and one thing I remember about the meal was that the water came in strange glasses.  I can't remember exactly what the situation was, but they were awkward.  The omlet was pretty good.  It could have been done for another minute or two.  The homefries and toast were decent, nothing to write home about.  To me the prices were slightly high for what you got.  At $10 for basic eggs, homefries, and toast, I would expect more.  I'd go back again, and maybe order lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Just arrived in the area and stumbled upon this cafe. We are always seeking allergy friendly dining choices.  My son had the adult burger with sweet potato fries.  Sadly I always forget to take the pictures \"before\" but, as you can see, he hates pictures but loves his burger! Everything thing we had was delicious.  The server was amazing and understanding of his allergies.  They have designated gluten free, vegetarian and vegan choices on their menu.  You can even purchase the art right off their walls from local artists!"}
{"text":"The service is excellent.  Everyone is very friendly and attentive.  I used to really like their food too, but my last several visits have lacked luster.  e.g. my \"Veggie Overload\" omelette was underloaded.  Also, be prepared to be courted to attend someone's performance or a charity cultural event.  I like that they promote community in that way, but it can sometimes come off as a sales pitch at first."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the Veggie Wrap, which is highlighted on the menu as a \"Square Favorite\" and described as \": \"Saut√©ed onions, peppers, mushrooms, zucchini, squash, spinach & sundried tomatoes on a grilled wheat tortilla with lettuce & feta cheese; served with French fries\". The fries were there and they were good.  As for the rest:  the tortilla was small and not grilled, there was no feta cheese, no sun-dried tomatoes, no squash, no peppers, and no onions, as far as I could tell.  There was mostly lettuce and a few pieces of zucchini. There was a faint flavor of cumin, but nothing in the wrap--like feta!!--that might have given it some moisture and possibly some taste. It was a very disappointing and tasteless dish. My husband also disliked his Veggie Wrap, but said it had a lot of zucchini but not much else.  $9.50 would have been reasonable for the wrap as advertised.  As served consisting of a tortilla, lettuce, and 2 or 3 thin slices of zucchini--not so much.   ( I thought of complaining at the time and I am sorry I did not.  We were meeting up with an old friend and were busy talking and catching up and it didn't seem to be appropriate to inject this issue into our get-together.)"}
{"text":"Pittsburghers sure love their brunch! There were as many people waiting as there would be outside a Pamela's on a typical weekend, but they got us in pretty quickly (under 10 minutes). The place is quite trendy, with cool decorations and cups and shirts on sale. We were directed to the \"bar,\" which to me was a new experience for eating brunch. It was nice watching the waiters/waitresses take orders and make milkshakes. As for the food, the short rib scramble was nothing short of fantastic. Lots of delicious meat mixed in with yummy scrambled eggs, along with onion and mushroom. I don't think you can go wrong with any of their choices, as they have all sorts of interesting omelettes, scrambles, and wraps."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once, but I was not overly impressed. I ordered a tofu scramble, and it was a small portion, and very bland. It seemed to me that the cook didn't know how to cook tofu properly. It wouldn't have been so bad, but it was incredibly expensive for the portion and quality.  The waitstaff was very pleasant though, and the location is beautiful. A nice sidewalk cafe in Regent Square to catch some sun and people-watch throughout brunch. Plus, they sponsor a softball team in the Steel City Softball League. Last I heard, there was a new menu, so I'll definitely give it another shot and get some eggs next time."}
{"text":"How boring, another 5 star review for the Square Cafe!  This place is incredible. It's always packed and once you've tasted this amazing food you'll get it. This isn't greasy diner breakfast food. It's art. Vegetarian? Vegan? Gluten-free? No problem, so is most of their menu. Daily specials often tempt you away from your original choices. Stand outs for me are the asparagus and goat cheese scramble (my stomach growled as I typed this), the square breakfast which I can get with soy chorizo(!), the breakfast burrito with homemade salsa, and don't even get me started on those pancakes. What a truly special restaurant. Only negative for me is location, I'd prefer not to get on the Parkway if I'm jonseing for breakfast.   Wait in line. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Well the Square cafe is highly rated, personally I think there are a ton of better breakfast places out there. I got a classic breakfast, so it should be basic but this was too basic. No flavor in the home fries, I mean how hard would it be to add salt and pepper or some kind of store bought seasoning. It was fairly busy but I'd call it a normal rush; however before I finished eating I was handed the check. I think they they probably are nice or friendly but I didn't experience it. A combination of so-so food and not great service make this the one and only time I will be visiting."}
{"text":"Risotto bluberry pancake - tasty but I felt like they could use more blueberry, or more risotto? Seemed a bit plain without the whipped cream butter.   Seasoned potatos - got a side order of these which were very well seasoned, big hearty portion that we struggled to finish, but we did because, well, potatos!  Chicken crepes - loved them. I got that guilty feeling while eating it... It was smothered in some delicious white sauce which you known isn't healthy for you but you don't care, kinda like when you slurp up the hollandaise on a benny. But its OK because I ordered salad with it.  Service was prompt and straight forward, no issues."}
{"text":"First time back in Pittsburgh and this was a brunch place my friend suggested. They offered many different flavored lattes, scrambles and pancakes. My husband and I got the lemon ricotta blueberry pancake and uncle Charlie's scramble. I liked the pancake more than the scramble. The pancakes were light, fluffy and not too sweet.  The scramble was a little plain."}
{"text":"I've managed to stumble in the door on two separate occasions, both on weekend mornings, and the place was packed with people who clearly had excellent taste. The servers are friendly and the menu packed with delicious options. I had omelettes and coffee both times, and I couldn't find anything to complain about for either of them. The food was excellently seasoned and the coffee delicious. They also have a selection of espresso drinks and various smoothies that I hope to sample in the future.  Nevertheless, it was quite busy and crowded. I'm not surprised, though, and didn't fault them a bit-- they service was quick and friendly regardless and I just hope their business stays as vibrant as ever."}
{"text":"I love Square Cafe!  When I lived in Pittsburgh, I took all of my visitors there.  LOVED IT!!  I ate here at least 3xs a month.  I had to stop myself from eating there all the time.  Get whatever the special is.  Sauces here are amazing.  I love their food.  The hot chocolate is delicious.  The eggs benedict.  The huevos rancheros.  The toast can be a little too crunchy but the butter is delicious.  Just go there, eat and enjoy."}
{"text":"I use to live up the street from this place and was there on one of the first days it opened. I was pretty excited to find out that it was two women running the cafe and so excited that I could walk up the street to get breakfast on the weekends. Before this place opened you really had no where else to go for breakfast in Regent Square except across the street to the coffee shop.   My friends and I started to frequent the Square and found the wait was long, the service sometimes off  (unless our friend would wait on us) and to me the food was a bit over priced. But I kept hoping they would get some of this stuff together and thinking they just needed a couple more months and it will work out. Then I moved away.  Four years later, they still don't have it together! I was visiting Pittsburgh and met up with my friend  here. The line was out the door and when my friend went in to ask if we had to put our name in or what the deal was no one knew! Then we see 4 people come in and just jump right in front of us. After 15 minutes we saw no one around to take names or anything. You are suppose to put your name somewhere? But no one really knew! It was like we needed a secret password to just get in the door. If we guessed right perhaps we could get a seat?   It was so disorganized and reminded me of when they first opened. Perhaps its better to go during the week but seriously, how hard it is to have someone take people's name and greet them? The menu still seemed a bit over priced just for some basic items. We ended up going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch place! We came here around noon, on December 31 and had a good 30 minute wait. But once we were seated the service was fast and efficient. We tried the Quinoa & Lima Bean Skillet (which was just so healthy and delicious). We had the breakfast burrito too, which was sooo good! Their drinks menu looked so good, and we weren't disappointing! We had some of their specialty coffee drinks,and they were really good! I am waiting for a chance to go back there again :)"}
{"text":"Went here for a midday lunch on a Saturday. We didn't have to wait for a table which was nice. We got vegetable soup as a starter which was delicious. However the chicken pesto wrap, and the eggs with salmon and capers, left something to be desired. The decor is cool and maybe we just made bad choices but we weren't impressed by the Square Cafe."}
{"text":"I come to this cute cafe with an eclectic flair whenever I want to get in touch with my inner tree-hugger.  Ernest, friendly servers. Solid brunch fare. Price a tad on the high side.  Also, it opens for brunch on Saturday. Many restaurants in Pittsburgh, even those that ostensibly serve brunches, only do so on Sundays. The Square Cafe offers a (somewhat) healthier alternative to Pamela's."}
{"text":"I had a taste of  the most delicious breakfast I've ever had this weekend. Spinach and portobello mushroom florentine over foccacia and topped with a runny egg. Words would not do it justice."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to visit here ever since we saw it was features on food channel. I really wanted to like here. But everything we ordered was a disappointment. We ordered Asparagus & Bavarian Ham crepe, pancetta omelette, and Quinoa & Lima Bean Skillet. None of these three impressed us. The price is high, the service is friendly but average. Besides their rather unique menu, and offers vegetarian and vegan dishes, the tastes were really not that great, the ingredients were not that fresh. Crepe was too dry, omelette was so-so, the quinoa & Lima bean skillet sounded fancy, but tasted strange.    Still thinks Pamela is a better choice."}
{"text":"The lemon ricotta blueberry pancakes were some of the best pancakes I've ever had and my boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his chorizo eggs benedict. I love that the menu changes from season to season. The atmosphere was awesome, but the tree above had small leaves falling all over the place and into our food. But the food was great and I highly recommend going here!  Update: I have since been back and the omelettes were not up to standards and were a bit overcooked. The matcha pancake was good and tasted exactly as expected, but the waitress seemed annoyed when I asked questions about it."}
{"text":"Cute & eccentric cafe! Great service even when it's packed. The venue is small, but worth it! There is something for everyone on the menu, I appreciate the meals prepared with health in mind. The beverage menu is awesome, A LOT of selection from coffees, lattes, smoothies, shakes, etc. The breakfast was simple & tasted delicious. Definitely want to go back!"}
{"text":"I woke up today hungry for breakfast. A LOT of breakfast. And basically wanted it all. Luckily the square cafe had just the menu item I was looking for.   Not overly busy like the last time I tried to come, Thursday morning was a good day to go. I am very impressed by the menu; perfect for breakfast or lunch and plenty of vegetarian options. I ordered the square cafe breakfast which included 2 eggs, a protein, and either potatoes and toast or a pancake. I ordered it with the pancake and got a side of the potatoes because I really was ready to have it ALL!   The waitresses were both really nice and fast and the food came out fast too. The pancake was perfect, the scrambled eggs were nearly perfect (I am picky and like them softer rather than harder) and the potatoes were plenty. I ended up not having enough room to finish the tofu so I took it to go.   I will definitely return (on a weekday preferably) and try a veggie burger or other breakfast item!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that it is extremely hard for me to have a relaxed dining out experience. I have absurd food allergies, all with anaphylactic symptoms, so I carry my Epi-pen on me at all times as if it were a part of my body. At Square Cafe, I achieved what I would call the perfect dining out experience for breakfast. They are sensitive to dietary concerns, allergies, and intolerances and their menu is unique and offers up some delectable options for everyone. I devoured the goat cheese, sun dried tomato omelet scramble and sipped on an almond milk latte. Both were a true delight for my taste buds.   Pros: -Almond milk option for coffee -Delicious food and drinks -Blankets if you sit outside and get cold -Outdoor seating   Cons: -They charge extra $$ for almond milk, however, it is not posted on their menu or their blackboard above the barista bar anywhere. -Very tight indoor seating, cramped location -If you are going with a group, if your full party is not there, they will seat others before you even if you put in your name."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I've been coming here for years! I know the owner Sherri and she's awesome! The food is always on point. I get the veggie omelette each time and each time its amazing! My boyfriend got the ranchero omelette and he loved it as well. The potatoes are to die for highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"A nice alternative to Pamela's and without the wait. The space is very clean with typical diner decor, service is great. I liked their coffee a lot, a latte that comes with proper foam is hard to find in a diner. For food, I had a brunch combo thing - sausage (that actually turned out to be a sausage patty but that's alright because I like those better anyway), eggs and potatoes. Unlike Pamela's, their breakfast combo doesn't come with pancakes, you can choose either eggs or pancakes. Sad but it's plenty of food.  The eggs were great and they have a nice selection of cheeses to scramble them with. Potatoes had a nice spicy flavor but were a little dry. I'm definitely adding Square to brunch rotation."}
{"text":"To describe this restaurant I would say an intracet, delicious, original cafe. The food is always exactly as you order and always hot. I usually order the special every time. Very good breakfast and not to much to order for lunch but what they offer for lunch is terrific. There burger is delicious. Also there milkshakes and lattes are great."}
{"text":"So I never in a million years would of tried this place if it wasn't for a great groupon deal I found!  Went here on a Friday for brunch and it was amazing!  I tried the Bacon, eggs, and asparagus OH MY!! It was a very interesting combination which I ended up loving. First there was a bed of crunchy hash browns with a layer of bacon and asparagus covering them. I got it topped with 2 eggs over easy along with a side of wheat toast. Everything was cooked perfectly to my liking with decent portion sizes too.  Then my brunch buddy for the day opted for a special they were having which was a mushroom frittata with cheese along side fresh greens. The greens looked delicious and he was very happy with the meal. I didn't get a chance to taste it but the greens looked fresh but the frittata seemed a bit unappealing to look at. I was told it tasted fantastic and to me thats what matters.  The wait staff was very nice and informative on the menu and our food came out in a timely manor.  The decor was very interesting as well. There was a local artist showing off her oil paintings which was awesome they support the local art scene only part of that I didn't like was someone stopped at our table and started taking pictures behind me of the art work which was a bit uncomfortable since I was shoveling food in my mouth lol.  Like to try this neat delicious little spot again and explore the menu more"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, staff was really great. Unfortunately the food wasn't and really over priced. You can tell they try very hard to be different, unfortunately that hurts them more. I will try them again maybe for lunch but breakfast was a let down. I got scrambled eggs since they didn't have regular white bread for dipping, and they had a strange texture part dry like they were over done while other parts were runny.. I dry heave just thinking about it. Bacon not cooked very well the fat squishy and I opted for a pancake instead of home fries also just mediocre. I hate to be so harsh but that was my experience with the food the most upsetting part was for this \"meal\" I paid $10 bucks. Hubby did like his $12 dollar breakfast burrito, his only complant was that the actual burrito was bigger than items inside of it. It is also one of thoose places that krams you in like sardines. When we got there they were pretty busy so I was excited about how great it would be sadly it was just disappointing and honestly makes me not even want to try them again if you can't even get breakfast right..."}
{"text":"If the line is not out the door we love Sunday breakfast here. Delicious sweet and savory selection. the coffee is fresh and better than most places. All the servers/baristas are friendly and helpful. Menu changes frequently so I can't really recommend what is my favorite. If you go on a Sunday be ready for a decent wait 30 mins after they open."}
{"text":"The food here is okay. Not amazing enough that I would come here often but I would come here again at least once more. I ordered the pumpkin pancakes which are seasonal. I love pumpkin flavored food and basically anything pumpkin so I was a little disappointed that I couldn't really taste any pumpkin in the pancakes. They seemed like regular pancakes to me with some cinnamon, cloves, etc.   The service here is very friendly though. Waitress was nice and recommended seasonal items to us. They use some kind of phone app to take orders which is pretty interesting. Since this place is a cafe they have free Wi-fi. I went on a weekday so not sure what the weekend is like but the atmosphere was very calm and quiet. Seemed like a nice place to relax and have a chat with a friend or complete stranger."}
{"text":"Update June 2018: Today I had a veggie bowl that I just loved! First, the egg on top was done perfectly - crispy, translucent whites and runny yellow. I thought the only way to get eggs like that was if I cooked them myself!  This bowl had quinoa as the base and was filled with grilled veggies including zucchini, mushrooms, peppers, broccoli and cauliflower. I can't wait to replicate this at home. It was so delicious!  I had the special Brussels sprout has, grits, and one egg overt easy. Delicious! Perfect! Our server was friendly and efficient. He kept our coffee filled and checked back after our food arrived to see if we needed anything. The check was delivered promptly. Another friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes and noted how light, airy and delicious they were.  Another friend the shorty rib crepe which she seemed to enjoy. We sat outside as it was a beautiful day. Will definitely check this place out again despite being a long ways from home!"}
{"text":"\"There was a little girl and she had a little curl right in the middle of her forehead. And when she was good she was very good indeed, and when she was bad she was horrid.\" This rhyme from my childhood always comes to mind when I think about Square Cafe. I've had wonderful food there, and I've had stuff that should never have been brought to a table.   I was there the first few years, and the food was awesome. Then it was terrible. Then the former partner (Sheree?) returned and took over the business and the quality went up - but over the next 12 months it dropped off again. At some point they hired a new chef (don't know her name but her beau was working the coffee bar) and everything was very good (Johnny Cakes were awesome) but apparently she's gone now too. They took my favorites off the menu (including Green Eggs and Ham, temporarily, because they said they couldn't make it in the winter - WTF? Basil grows in a flowerpot, man!) and started making blueberry pancakes with frozen blueberries. Who puts frozen blueberries in $11 pancakes?   When I moved to Regent Square 6 years ago I went 2-3 times a month, and I usually got an egg sandwich on ciabatta. Every time it was different. Sometimes it was dripping oil (I swear some cooks buttered the ciabatta and some didn't). Sometimes it was joy on a plate. Sometimes the bacon was hard as leather. Once when I got pancakes instead, I paid the extra $2.50 or whatever for banana and received a plate with 3 banana slices on it. No kidding. That's $0.83 per slice.  In spring 2010 I went for a weekday lunch with some friends. They got breakfast food, which seemed fine, but I ordered yogurt with granola. What I got was a dish of plain yogurt with about one tablespoon of oatmeal sprinkled on top. And for some reason it tasted like onion. This \"yogurt with granola\" was $8!   The coffee has always been good, as far as I can tell. But a friend of mine once noticed that he had been charged two different prices for his coffee on two consecutive days. Apparently the coffee with refills - even if you're never offered one or accept it - is $2.80 but if you don't get a refill it's $2.19? That's just weird.   Bottom line: Food quality is a crapshoot, but it's _always_ expensive. And that's just not worth the 2-block walk from my house."}
{"text":"Like I have mentioned before if you read my reviews I'm a three strikes you're out consumer. Also with the help of social deals like groupon it may get me back in the door sooner than later. So with my deal in tow I took \"Mai\" back to square cafe for breakfast. Out the door by 9:30am and we were on our way to run errands and enjoy the 80 degree weather.   I don't work Mondays bc I work weekends Repping so when everyone is back at work I get to enjoy low key, uncomplicated, minus the masses dining at this normally unavailable restaurant. FREEDOM!!   Today at Square Cafe I had a sublime breakfast with \"Mai\". I have been craving crepes for awhile and since I am avoiding sweets I decided on the Vegetable Crepes, Sauteed zucchini, mushrooms, onions, peppers, spinach, and sun-dried tomato spread topped with just the right amount of parmesan shavings.  The crepes were thin with the right blending of flavors from the light veggies, sundried tomato matched well adding the tang, acid, and fruity balance.   Sitting outside on a day like today is faultless and makes the stress of running around after a horrible weekend much easier to look forward to."}
{"text":"Great experience here a Square Cafe. The food was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend's egg sandwich with apple smoked chicken sausage was incredible - I never knew a breakfast sandwich could taste so good! My pumpkin pancakes came out undercooked the first time around, so they took them back and re-made them for me (and then they were delicious). Why only 4 stars instead of 5? The service wasn't great..our server was very nice, but slow. Apparently their computers went down while we were there (she didn't take our orders until at least 25 minutes after we got there). And when they re-did my pumpkin pancakes, they didn't come back out until everyone else had finished eating (so it took quite a while). Would I go back? Definitely!"}
{"text":"We went at noon on a Monday and there was no wait (it was also 4 degrees or something). I've been here a few times before and I have always been pleased with what I have gotten.  Today, though, I wish I got what my husband ordered!  He got the Tahini Chickpea Burger with feta cheese and olive tapenade.  It was really delicious.  I think the patty was a little bland on its own, but the feta and olive tapenade really brought it all together.  My veggie overload omelette was pretty ordinary, but I always love the home fries.  They had this cayenne pepper saltiness that make them very crave worthy.  Good atmosphere, nice menu.  It's a great place to go when I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"First and foremost it needs to be mentioned that hipsters flock to this place as if they were handing out penny free trade coffee and slightly worn had knitted sweaters. Be prepared to stand in line for at least 15 minutes to get seated. Other than that the food and coffee here is amazing. Seriously the last unicorn lavender latte is one of the best coffees I've had. This place is just the right mix of gourmet and comfort food."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Square Cafe for the first time for a Saturday morning brunch! Place was full, but it was just a short wait for seats at the bar. Excellent breakfast options! I really appreciated the small portion choices, as well as the protein pancakes and omelettes, too. With a wide range of yummy options, your whole crew is sure to be satisfied. Coffee comes in really cool handmade mugs, too. Service was fast and servers kind. The vibe of Square Cafe is fun and hippie and the morning I was there was full of a diverse crowd of people.  One thing to note, you can't put your name on the wait list until the whole party is there, and they don't take reservations. Otherwise an excellent establishment!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Always a great breakfast or brunch. The only downside is a super crowded space and you're practically sitting with the people next to you but the food is worth it. There is usually always a line out the door to be seated."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular, although this was my first visit. This place specialized in vegan fare as well as carnivorous.   As I looked over the menu I was surprised to see vegan omelets, but the egg wasn't egg substitute, it was real egg. Kinda defeats the purpose of being vegan.   So as I searched the menu I found the obligatory vegan burger that everyone offers. This veggie patty was made with mushrooms, onions, peppers and black beans, seasoned to perfection with cilantro, curry, and cumin, served on a kaiser roll... Yawn! Been there, done that, and I bet it will fall apart when I lift it off the plate and drip out of my roll when I take the first bite. Yep I was right,  All over the plate, it's like a huge black bean mom gave birth to a bunch of black beans. Seriously if you insist on having a veggie burger on your menu, please just serve a Boca burger and top it however you like. I'm really tired of home made vegan burgers that leave an empty bun in your hand after first bite.   Next time I'll do the vegetable wrap, it looks more appetizing with mixed greens, saut√©ed zucchini, mushrooms, spinach, and feta with a sun dried tomato spread.   So I hope the menus for these so called vegan friendly restaurants start coming up with imaginative offerings other than black bean burgers on white rolls. BORING!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and I like that it's all locally grown. It's an adorable little cafe. My only complaint is that there's never a good time to come in without it being packed."}
{"text":"Really tasty breakfast/brunch spot. Was with a party of 5 and though it took a while to get seated, we enjoyed our experience overall. Their coffee is delicious and all of our plates were a step away from being licked clean. The food was delicious - Brussel sprout hash with bacon and cheesy grits was excellent and innovative. Plates are moderately priced around $10-13 per plate, however the servings were a bit on the small side for some of our plates but i didn't feel ripped off. The only other drawback was service.. our waiter never checked in with us for refills and was moving fast so it was hard to flag him down. Despite this, We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Square Cafe is my standby when I have guests in town or when I want a special breakfast. Here's why:  Unique options: Square Cafe's menu changes seasonally, so there's always something new to try. There are classic dishes that stick around year after year too. My current favorite is the Short Rib Benedict (pictured). Before the Benedict, my favorite was the Breakfast Burrito.  Fair prices: You get what you pay for. Sure, breakfasts at Square are a few dollars more than some of the local diners nearby. But at Square you get golden-colored yolks, fresh greens, and local ingredients.  Great service: I've always had friendly and attentive servers. Plus, many servers have worked there for years so they are experts. It does get very busy on weekends, but I've learned to time my visit before or after the big brunch rush.  Coffee: Their coffee is \"bottomless,\" which means you can get a free hot or cold refill to go!"}
{"text":"This place holds a strong monopoly on the Regent Square brunch crowd.  It is packed on the weekends, and usually hopping during any given day.  My biggest complaint is really that it's terribly crowded.  It almost pains me when there's nothing really to make fun of, but from the food to the waitstaff to the decor, everything falls above the line at the very least.    Everybody goes there for breakfast, but they have delicious lunch options as well.  Well shit, I guess there's really nothing wrong with this delicious, well staffed, well managed restaurant.    But don't come here please, because it's difficult to find things to do in Regent Square when I have to wait for a table.  And that's how crimes happen...when you're waiting for brunch...first world problem."}
{"text":"I am updating my review for Square Cafe, as promised, because in the past few months they have changed their menu a bit, and their coffee has improved substantially.  These two changes make a big difference.  The new menu, while still trying a bit too hard, now has flavorful food.  I don't know whether they changed their coffee blend, or just their process, but it's now been drinkable several times running.  So I give you permission to eat here again.  Congratulations to Square Cafe for solving the coffee issue!  Two things anyone eating here should still be aware of:  First, the portions are too large, which is certainly not going to bother most people - but if you're coming with a group, or with kids, just keep it in mind.  Second, ordering a la carte or off-menu is very, very expensive, so think carefully before you ask for an omelette that's not on the menu."}
{"text":"When moving away from the South Hills and the delicious Dor-Stop, I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to find a unique and tasty new breakfast spot in the east. Well, thankfully, good friends quickly introduced us to Square Cafe.  I highly recommend trying their specials. My first time dining here, I tried the pineapple pancakes topped with burnt almonds. They were delicious (though sadly a couple of the pancakes were raw in the center). The fruit crepes - which are always on the menu -  are also amazing. I was expecting the crepes to be heavy, especially since I ordered them with Nutella, but they were filled with fruit and seemed very light, dare I say, even healthy.  I've also been very impressed with the restaurant's staff. They're helpful and friendly. We've been seated very promptly (even on busy Saturday mornings) and received our food quickly.  This is a great, must-try breakfast/brunch spot!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat at Square Cafe for the longest time and last week I was able to get one of my friends to come with me to check it out.   When we arrived that morning it was busy; most of the tables were filled but there was no long waiting line. My friend and I liked all the bright, colorful paintings that were hanging all around the cafe. So far so good.  My friend ordered the special of the day, Turkey Devonshire, and I ordered the Omelet Ranchero. I was surprised by how quickly the food came out and I wondered, is the food any good? The food was actually better than good- it was amazingly delicious! I can't remember what was in my friend's Turkey Devonshire but he finished it in several minutes! The portions were more than adequate! I only ate half of my Omelet Ranchero because I had gotten full. My omelet had cheese and chunks of ham so I had a pretty high protein breakfast.  We had a great first experience at Square Cafe and I will definitely return soon with one of siblings."}
{"text":"After seeing the Groupon available every time I open the app to check for deals, I finally caved and bought it! Not to mention that my fellow Yelper Meghan B. adores this place so I wanted to try it out. I'm so glad I did!  We went on a Friday afternoon and I was surprised by how packed it was. We ended up sitting outside just so we didn't have to wait. We didn't mind, though. The outdoor seating is pretty cute! Our server was prompt and friendly and understood that we were going to order a lot due to having a $40 towards food (we only paid $20 for it!).  I wanted to try something different, but after an awesome chest day at the gym, I wanted some meat and ordered a burger. It was awesome! Now, the patty did appear to be frozen, however the garlic toasted bun and beautifully positioned toppings totally made up for it. Nothing wrong with frozen patties, but I just expected it to be a little more gourmet. Not complaining. It was still very good considering the place isn't a burger joint. I had a side of fries that were crispy and delicious and cole slaw that wasn't too heavy.   We also ordered a Nutella/Strawberry crepe. It was my first time ever trying a crepe and I fell in love! I'm not really one for super sweet meals, so I don't think I would order this as a breakfast entree, but it totally hit the spot after my burger. We also split a Chunky Monkey pancake. Wow! Not too sweet, but just sweet enough. You really didn't even to use much syrup. It had bananas, chocolate chips, whipped cream and topped with coconut.   I have officially fallen in love with this place and can't wait to go back and introduce more people to this delicious goodness! It's a shame it's only open till three, but from the looks of it, they make enough during the morning and afternoons to close their cash registers comfortably."}
{"text":"Really a 3.5.  We did brunch/breakfast on a Saturday, and the menu is certainly well conceived, and stretches beyond the normal eggs, bacon, and hash. There are some great combos (brussel sprouts and lima bean hash), and some great egg combos with great cheese options beyond the norm. Service is good, execution of the dishes is good enough, but the rating would be better if they pulled off a few of the option with a bit more quality - it is busy on the weekend AMs - but I would recommend it to anyone. Pretty good stuff."}
{"text":"Great place, excellent breakfasts, everything done with a creative flair.  Cornmeal pancakes, lemon ricotta pancakes, tiramisu pancakes.... too much to choose from, that's my only possible complaint :-)"}
{"text":"This is a bustling cafe with a variety of menu options to choose from. Most guests would be able to find something on the menu easily. The food here was decent but not good enough that I would come here that often. The cafe is only open until 3 pm so it's more appropriate for breakfast, brunch, lunch or meeting a friend to catch up. The prices were decent and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"This place is so colourful and happy. Maybe the vibe of this place stood out to me so much because it contrasted the dark, rainy morning we went in. Either way, quite memorable.  The menus are very cute with the unicorn. Very cute. I'll admit I got probably the most boring item on the menu - a small bowl of oatmeal. There are so many options I got a little overwhelmed and stuck with something simple.  The service was very fast. I did notice there were lots of servers, and from other reviews it looks like this place can get pretty busy. On the particular day we went it wasn't crazy but it was certainly mostly full."}
{"text":"I only spend a few weeks in Pittsburgh out of the year, so I judge a restaurant based on whether or not I would want to come back during my short visits.   Definitely want to come back here. They have a ton of vegetarian options which means you're not confined to eating scrambled eggs and potatoes, and the menu is big enough that everyone should be able to find something they like. I had the Veggie Scramble, made up of fingerlings, squash, parsnips, and carrots and topped with an over-easy egg. It wasn't super flavorful on its own, but with a little added salt and pepper and a dash of ketchup, it was delicious.   The coffee, which isn't great but also isn't terrible, is served up in an adorable square mug that really encompasses what this place is about. It's cute and quirky, but you know you're going to get a good meal. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"** Extremely crowded / popular on weekends with waits around 45 minutes. Solid lemon berry ricotta pancakes but possibly lacking on savory foods... Wish there were more options that gave you both.   I came here after church for brunch on a Sunday, so naturally this place was packed. We were told the wait was around 25 min but maybe ended up being closer to 45. Since it's so busy, it definitely feels very crowded and people are rushing around and squeezing by each other just to get around. So if you are looking for a more chill place where you can sit for longer and relax, maybe this isn't the place.  I am typically more of a sweet breakfast person (although I usually like a combination of both) so I ordered the lemon berry ricotta cakes ($11, 3 pancakes). There was a very unique and subtle hint of lemon that really complimented the sweetness of the pancake, which was nice and moist. A light drizzle of syrup and I was digging in.  Though the first pancake was amazing, I do have to say that eating three of them definitely grows on you. I was also eyeing the square breakfast which has 2 eggs, a breakfast meat, and pancake since it gives a lot of variety which is what I like best. The only reason I didn't get it was I wanted to order something more unique considering I waited for so long, but it looked great from what I saw when other people ordered it.   My friends all got savory options such as the ranchero omlette which they didn't seem to think was anything special... Can't comment on it because I didn't have it but maybe they need to step up their savory game."}
{"text":"Visited this past Friday thanks to a wonderful Groupon. We decided to try lunch this time, having had breakfast there a couple times before (which we always enjoyed, but found a bit overpriced for what you are getting). I tried the Square burger (to which I added Amish cheddar and bacon). WOW. Now I know where I can get a tasty burger around here. Delicious. So juicy, just the right amount of greasy, the Amish cheddar was nice and sharp and tangy, just the way I like it. Thick slices of bacon cooked crispy, the way it should always be. And their fries are great. Mike had, and much enjoyed, the chicken and leek crepes. We also got a vanilla milkshake which I must say was very satisfying, if not a tad bit pricey. All in all it was a great meal; I just wish they were open later!  And I hate to admit it, but the fact they their name is Square Cafe and their logo is a circle is, for some reason, incredibly irritating to me. I suppose I am too cynical to appreciate the irony...lol"}
{"text":"We always enjoy the breakfast and yummy coffee in the awesome square mugs, square is amazing!! Great food, great atmosphere, and I seen they sell cool art.  I strongly suggest giving it a try."}
{"text":"OMG I love this place they have a great breakfast lunch and dinner here ... So bring a friend or your boo and have a good time .. P. s yes you can sit outside"}
{"text":"I went here with a new friend since she recommended it. It was a Sunday and it started snowing. The place was packed so we had to wait in the foyer type area with a heater. I didn't mind standing around and chatting as I heard such great things about this place. We were seated and quickly greeted by our waiter who was such a nice gentleman. He told us about the art on the walls and I inquired about the mugs we were drinking out of because I kind of loved them right away. I had green tea and the smoked salmon scramble. I found everything to be delicious and would go there again. The only thing I wasn't too excited about was the noise level and how closely we were sitting to two other people who I felt like were listening in to our conversation the whole time."}
{"text":"Groupon for here so good discount.  We both had crepes which were very good!  Sweet potato fries were sad and a little soggy.  Fries shouldn't be served in a bowl either, they tend to get soggy.  Milk shake was mostly milk, not thick at all. Cute Waiter! GRRR!"}
{"text":"The owner, Sherry is the nicest woman on the planet. You may get a hug from her, even if you are meeting her for the first time. By moving my table to accommodate some diners next to me, I got mad hugs. And a nice chat about our rescue dogs at home- always a huge fan of that. The wait staff is always super laid back and friendly as well and seem to go above and beyond to be real and chat......so ok, on with the food.  So SC may be a tad overpriced, but they serve a great brunch. The veggie omelet is always solid and always chock full of steamed veggies. They do a really great soy latte as well- served in these cool, square mugs.   Beware- the place gets packed during brunch! There is a coffee bar area where you can sit and wait, so I suggest bringing a laptop with you while you wait."}
{"text":"Square Cafe is a unique place to eat.  My friends treated me there for my first experience yesterday as a birthday get together.  There were a lot of unique options for drinks and dishes.   I had the gluten free pancakes with chocolate chips instead of compote.  They were good - they tasted like normal pancakes, which I miss.  They must've been careful about cross contamination because I didn't get sick.  Hooray!  Drawbacks: they will not seat you/put a table together for you until your whole party is there.  Also, they do not split checks.  And you can only use two forms of payment per table.  So if you want to split it more ways than two, bring cash.  They didn't warn us until we checked out."}
{"text":"Over-rated.  I was in town for the weekend and wanted to have a nice vegan brunch before heading home so by the power of Yelp, I ended up at Square Cafe. I was honestly torn between Square Cafe and the hot dog joint across the street, and I should have had a hot dog.   As others have noted, there's a wait. But I'm patient. I was seated in about 20 minutes and got a cup of joe with almond milk really quickly. My fiance ordered a fancy coffee (something about a unicorn?) and that arrived a short time later. Maybe it was our seat location or maybe it was because I looked like someone who likes getting jostled around, but servers kept bumping into me the entire time we were seated. That was kind of a buzzkill.  For some reason, it was also a million degrees in the restaurant. I was super uncomfortable. Equally un-awesome was my meal. I ordered the tofu scramble. I counted 3 pieces of mushrooms in it. However, there were lots of undercooked Brussels sprouts. To add to my misery, our waitress keyed in the wrong order for my fiance, and my food was whisked away while they remade his meal. Then they brought back my lukewarm food and his side of flavorless home fries. I patiently waited to eat my meal until my fiance's food arrived, and was just underwhelmed by it. I slathered on some hot sauce, but that didn't even do much. He did like his white bean skillet, so that was the highlight of our dining experience.   Overall, I had a mediocre meal and wouldn't come back. There are other options for vegan brunch in the Burgh, and I'm guessing they have to be better? Right?"}
{"text":"I totally love the food and vibe of Square Cafe! I love the coffee/tea mugs that are awesomely shaped.   What I don't like is waiting for so long and being super crammed in to the place, feeling like I'm in the way of everybody. My two tips for the folks at Square Cafe are: 1) Get the NoWait app service! and 2) Open another location!   The only reason I don't go to Square Cafe more often is that I know I'm going to have to wait for a long time and then be packed in and I know that the wait will be done through an antiquated system of waiting. I would go even more often if there were another location maybe in Shadyside/East Liberty area, since there's a lack of brunch spots there!   Pleeeeease open a new location - everyone loves you! Give more people the opportunity to do so :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my girlfriend. This place is a cute little place that serves up some delicious and tasty food.  I had the salmon scramble and my girlfriend had the vegetables with eggs benedict on top.  The food came out very quick and was eaten very fast because it tasted great.  The reason I give it 4 stars it because the service to get our check was very slow and took 25 minutes but all in all a good experience!"}
{"text":"Hippie menu, small portions and no attention to presentation.   I ordered the tofu hash while my friend ordered the breakfast sandwich.  I was so disappointed when the plate came out, more than half the plate consisted of..plate. There were 3 brussels sprouts (not exaggerating) and a few potatoes with tofu thrown together. I've made hash better and it was cheaper.  The sandwich was dry and small, barely enough to feed a child."}
{"text":"In the words of Arnold, \"I'll be backkkkk.\" No, really. As soon as I can.  This place nails service, food and vibe. You're probably looking for menu teasers, so I'll get down to it: order the lemon ricotta pancakes. Then, have your friend next to you order the pulled pork eggs benedict (piled on grit cakes and covered in country gravy and scallions) with a bed of field greens. Can you say \"splitsies\"? Why throw all your balls in the \"sweet\" or \"savory\" courts when you can have both, right?  Also, take note of their creative cappuccino menu with reasonable prices. One more thing, they allow you to order pancakes in single orders (big fan of restaurants that do this). My sister was all about her smoked salmon omelette (cream cheese and capers), if that sounds up your alley.   Big props to our server for handling our large group like a pro. His strong voice was the perfect match for our madhouse family."}
{"text":"Every time we go to the square cafe is it nothing short of delicious perfection. The staff is extra friendly and they are always packed because their food is to die for. So delicious. Great atmosphere. Wonderful all around. Kudos!"}
{"text":"I went to Square Cafe on a Sunday afternoon for brunch and found my meal to be decent.  My boyfriend ordered the Square Breakfast with Chicken Sausage ($9.50) and I ordered a single packed of the special flavor of the day which was Sweet Potato ($4) and I also ordered a side of Cheese grits with Swiss cheese.  My boyfriend enjoyed his Square breakfast but said that it lacked flavor. However, it does cover all of the breakfast bases if you're looking for eggs, meat, potatoes and bread.  My Sweet Potato pancake was actually not all the way cooked through. The edges were done but the center was still very creamy and not firm. I have had sweet potato pancakes before and know that they usually add quite a bit of moisture to baked foods but this pancake was just plain undercooked. My  Cheese grits were good though."}
{"text":"Came to the Square Cafe for brunch on the weekend, so the wait was a decent amount of time - but well worth it for the food. The cafe was packed so we all crammed into a booth, but the interior is super cute and colorful. I got the garden bowl, which was absolutely AMAZING. It was packed with flavors and definitely \"hit the spot\" in a way that left you feeling satisfied but not overly full. The service itself was a little rushed, but that's understandable since it was so busy. Would come back anytime for the food."}
{"text":"eeeeeee I'm sorry Square Cafe, but I'm taking a star away.  Don't hate me.  I still really like you.  I'm just downgrading from \"love\" to \"really like.\"  I have tried a few other food items besides the Hopple Popple, and none of them have been 5 star worthy brunches.  I just came in Saturday around 11 (and, delightfully, we barely waited for a table), and the menu was all different.  That was exciting.  I decided to try the Green Eggs and Ham - pesto scrambled eggs with ham.  It was all pretty good - eggs didn't have quite as strong of a pesto taste as I'd like (my boyfriend's mom observed that they tasted more like \"basil\" and less like \"pesto\").  But the ham was pretty tasty.    I tried my boyfriend's fried chicken and biscuits, and I was super not-impressed.  No.  Where to begin.  Chicken was boneless, and breaded in a coating similar to what you get when you get fish 'n' chips.  It was sort of like....a chicken finger....in fish breading.  I can't explain it any better.  But it was sort of bizarre in that way.  The gravy had a strange taste to me, a little too sweet perhaps?  And the biscuits were more crumbly, less flaky.  Also my boyfriend's mom got the sausage and ricotta frittata, and she said it was pretty good, but didn't have much sausage to go around.  I tried it too - the sausage was tasty, but definitely not plentiful.    The last few times I've been in, I've felt this way - like the food isn't quite as good as I remember it.  Still, service is great, atmosphere is adorbs, and I still just like being there.  I should also say that the one time I didn't have good service, the manager dealt with it FABULOUSLY, and was hugely responsive to me.  It gave me a great vibe about the place and encourages me to keep coming back and trying more brunch items."}
{"text":"I've lived in Pittsburgh for a year now, and I have been so disappointed with the brunch options. That is until I discovered Square Cafe. This place was adorable, and the food was incredible! When we first arrived with a party of 4 there was a huge line and we anticipated a long wait, but ended up only waiting for 15 minutes! It was a bit chilly and they even brought outdoor heaters and blankets to stay warm! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Brought the man friend here for birthday brunch on a sunny and beautiful Thursday in the 'Burgh. I've seen the line on weekends from D's, but weekdays are a breeze. We were sat right away at a nice sidewalk table.   We brought champagne, so were greeted with a pitcher of oj for mimosas. It was great, just way more oj than we needed (I am a \"heavy on the champagne\" type of mimosa drinker). It wasn't a big deal at all, I just felt bad for wasting.  The meals were both perfect. I ordered a vegan tofu scramble, that was served with plenty of roasted veggies and mixed greens. BF got the salmon crepes, and he was in love. The food came fast and the waitress was friendly, as well as the guests around. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday morning looking for breakfast because it seemed to be a well-praised location on Yelp. The place seemed to be decently occupied with Regent Square locals and the waitress was pretty friendly, checking up on us multiple times throughout the meal.  The interior decoration is a bit quirky. There's a diner vibe with the tables, chairs, and bar counter, but the whole place is pretty colorful. From the bowls to the spots of color all over the place, color was indeed all over the place. I appreciated the local art hanging from the walls.  I decided to order the protein breakfast ($10) with scrambled eggs, bacon and their protein cinnamon pancake. My boyfriend tried their sweety white omelet ($11) which came with a side of fruit as well. We also ordered a side of sweet potato fries ($5) and OJ ($2.50). When the food arrived, we were ready to dig in. The OJ was maybe a little more than a cup in volume? and it was priced at $2.50, and another $2.50 for a refill! Definitely not worth it. The fries were super thin and unsatisfying, small portion size as well. The omelet, pancake, and eggs were okay. Nothing too outstanding about them. My boyfriend seemed to appreciate their thicker cut bacon.  Overall, for the price that we paid, I expected better. Either better quality or greater quantity. It was only an average meal and I don't believe it's worth its price."}
{"text":"Really great food! Like it is all good! However, they are super busy on the weekends - so be prepared to wait. Also, the 4 stars is because the staff (while super nice!) they do tend to rush you through your meal - I get it, they are really busy - but if you want a long brunch, to catch up with friends - I would skip this place and go to EASE up the road."}
{"text":"Today wer enjoyed another delicious breakfast at the Square Cafe.  Luckily we had Matt again as our server.  He previously recommended the Brussel Sprout dish that I adored (and inhaled).    With the new Spring menu,  he suggested the Tot Mess - tater tots with vegan chilli,  peppers, egg, etc.  Matt did it again - I LOVED my breakfast!  It's truly the perfect bite if you enjoy a savory breakfast.  Chilli and tots AND eggs?  Yes, please!   My only recommendation would be to select a runny egg (over easy,  poached,  or sunny) instead of scrambled.  The yolk mixing with the chilli and tots would make this breakfast irresistible!   Thank you again to our server,  Matt, for a great time and meal.  I cannot wait to go back and try another Matt suggested meal :)"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful! We came in on a Friday morning and the place was packed. Luckily, we were just a party of 2, so we were still seated immediately.   The service was good, we always had coffee and water. I got the Hopple Popple, which was really delicious. The cheese was on point, and the eggs, potatoes, peppers, ham and onions were really well seasoned. My boyfriend got the basic breakfast, and the homefries were really good -- and a tad bit spicy, which was great. I'd totally come here again!"}
{"text":"Not just for Squares!  This Caf√©'s coffees were amazeballs. The breakfasts were really yummy too. I loved the green mochi latte and veggie omelet.   Unfortunately, this place is outgrowing its shell. The line was long but moved very quickly. I'm sure in the summer, when they have outdoor tables, things would run smoother.   Overall, a great place. Clean, friendly, pleasant, and delicious!"}
{"text":"Hello my new favorite cafe in Pittsburgh!! A colleague and I came here for lunch on a bright, sunny afternoon and opted for a table outside. We love the neighborhood as it is which made sitting outside even better. I had the pancakes and my lovely lunch date had the eggs. Very nice! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Should I start with the negative or positive....okay, let's start on a positive note! Pro: the location makes it easy to get onto the Parkway East and the waitress was friendly. Yep, that was it for the positives.  The cons: andouille sausage that was lukewarm with casing that was unchewable - not pleasant to have to dispose of that on the side of the plate...one taste was enough. Cheese grits devoid of any cheese flavor, but packed with hard lumps of uncooked grain - the largest of which was walnut-sized. The eggs were done well, but the entire dish was topped with a sweet jam that had no relationship to the dish whatsoever.   My dining companion had high hopes for her goat cheese, leek and pancetta frittata topped with greens. Yet another fail. She proclaimed it dry with very few of the fillings to be found...but TONS of greens on top.  Odd.  Maybe the regular cooks were off for the holiday. Maybe they were overwhelmed by the crowd...although truth be told, we didn't wait for a table even though it was packed. I wish I could have had the experience that all these four and five star reviews had,  but after my first try, it isn't worth going back again. Pittsburgh has far too many great breakfast and brunch spots to bother with less than mediocre."}
{"text":"I liked the house made chicken sandwich. The ground chicken breast was moist and flavorful and topped perfectly with the caramelized leeks, asiago cheese, tomato & lettuce on the grilled kaiser roll. I chose the sweet potato fries instead of regular fries.  I loved the fact they were shoe string cut and fried to a crispy perfection.  I washed it all down with a brewed ice tea with a lemon wedge. What an enjoyable meal!"}
{"text":"As of today, I'm a big proponent of brunch. Before, I might have tagged along with friends to a cafe or a bar/restaurant for brunch, but I placed more weight on catching up on my sleep (rotating 12-hour shifts can do that, you know). You also would have never found me taking part in brunch alone.  After taking a 3-hour exam in the morning, I realized (well, my stomach and my glucose-deprived brain realized) that, with the exception of some iced coffee on my way to the testing center, I had been fasting for almost 16 hours (yikes!). (Note: if you're going to take an early morning exam, I don't recommend that you do what I did). I flopped down into my car and opened my Yelp app for some breakfast/brunch places close to where I live in Shadyside (I wasn't in the mood for a burger or salad). The first couple of places didn't pique my interest...then up came Square Cafe. This place had great reviews, the pictures looked legit, and wasn't top far away.  After I parked, I walked over to the cafe. By this time, it was around 11:30 AM. There were 4 groups of people eating outside in front of the cafe. I walked inside and was immediately greeted by an employee before I had the chance to breathe in the smell of coffee or listen to the chatter of the customers. Speaking of the customers, there was very little indoor seating left except for several open seats at the bar. I opted to sit there. Within a minute, the waitress brought me the menu and asked if I wanted coffee (of course I did).  What I like about their menu was that it wasn't too short or too long (like, Chinese-restaurant-long); it had a wide selection of breakfast and lunch dishes; it had quite a few gluten-, vegetarian-, and vegan-friendly options; and their prices were reasonable. I chose to get their vegetarian scramble with Swiss cheese and wheat toast. After around 10 minutes, I got my food. The scramble looked good and not too messy. The cheese seemed to have helped keep all the eggs and vegetables together. There was a side of hash browns, and four small pieces of buttered wheat toast with a side of strawberry jam.  The scramble itself was great! The egg was cooked just right, the vegetables were cooked but still crisp, and there was an even amount of cheese distributed throughout. It was maybe a tad salty...but I generally don't eat too many salty food, so I might have a lower threshold for saltiness. The hash browns were also great. They were cooked just right without any pieces being burnt or undercooked, and salty or bland. The buttered toast were good...but then again, who can mess up buttered toast? I finished most of my plate; I left several pieces of toast and some hash browns because it was a lot of food.  I am pretty impressed with the diverse clientele. There was a good mix of younger couples in their 20s having a brunch date, business people having a power lunch, and older people in their 60s reading the newspaper. I didn't feel out of place eating alone because the bar was almost full halfway through my meal. By the time I left around 12:30, a line was forming outside the entrance.  I will definitely come here again for breakfast, brunch, or lunch any day. It would be even better if they could serve Bloody Mary's and other cocktails...but I'm content with their selection of healthy shakes and smoothies that are made with vegan protein powder and whole fruits."}
{"text":"Brussel Sprout hash is a must-try. Groupons now available. Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place as everyone raves about it. But I couldn't.  There are great things about this place. The wait wasn't long at all (15 minutes for a Sunday morning!). The staff was awesome. Buuuut the food was just.. good. They do have a lot of (cringe but) \"unique\" options where almost everything sounds great. But I wasn't impressed.  I paid Meat and Potatoes brunch prices for Pamela's quality breakfast.  Breaks my french toast loving heart because this place is really cute and probably awesome for coffee and outdoor seating. Just not for me when I'm trying to do some serious breakfast."}
{"text":"I like Square Cafe and try to be supportive since it's an asset in Regent Square. But breakfast today was disappointing.  My over-medium eggs were runny, side pancake very dark on the bottom and chicken sausage under cooked. My dining partner had the frittata special which was good but not a 'wow'.  For the prices, I have higher expectations."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch.  Everything from the food to the decor to the service is warm, welcoming and fun.  Their recommended menu items are awesome."}
{"text":"Well, call me a fan. A super-caffeinated, stuffed-with-oatmeal-pancakes fan.   Ain't nothin' \"square\" about this place, totally hip to the groove! (Greg Brady voice)   Square Cafe was on point in every regard. My colleague (the one and only Rachel C, pancake master) arrived around 930 and were quickly equipped with waters and appropriate hot beverages. My coffee (which I needed desperately) was refilled graciously and often. We ordered up the lovely oatmeal pancakes, tricking ourselves into thinking they were \"healthy.\" Maybe slightly moreso than say...Snickers Bar pancakes, but these bad boys were very decadent, topped with mucho butter and pecans and peaches. I mean, really? REALLY!  We also split the Ranchero Omelette for some protein, which was fluffy, full of cheese and flavorful. Only complaint was homemade salsa was a bit runny, and wet eggs ick me out. Still though, I persevered.   I loved it so much I hung out an hour after breakfast at a table outside sipping a half chai/half coffee at a sweet sunny spot.   Then I left FLYING. Whatever is in that coffee...works. Whew.   Service, food, ambience all exceptional. Great breakfast/brunch/lunch places."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday with a group of seven knowing it would be busy.  Things seemed to be moving fine.  After waiting for 35 minutes with two kids, the waitress told us that they cleared a table for us and were waiting for the table beside it to finish up so they could seat us.  A couple minutes later the second table finished so we were expecting to sit soon.  All of the sudden they sat another group of five at those tables when there was space for them at the bar.    We asked what was going on and their explanation was \"sorry but it's Sunday\".    I can assure you we will not be going back with that attitude!  Can't say what the food is like but the attitude is poor."}
{"text":"Nice upscale keyword-clean diner style restaurant in a residential neighborhood. Prices are quite a bit higher than its competitors serving more greasy dressed down versions of the food. Other than the price, this place is fantastic."}
{"text":"Love this cute spot on Braddock! It was my first time in this area, and it left an impression. There's a strip of cute shops, cafes, restaurants, coffee shops, and a movie theater. Anyway... I equate this cafe to Pamela's but ~better~.  This cafe is fun! I love the cartoon-y menu and and funky mugs for coffee; they reflect the casual vibe and uniqueness. They have an extensive food and drink menu. I ordered the Square Breakfast while my friend ordered the Brussels Sprout Bowl. I highly recommend both!   * The Square Breakfast ($9.50): 2 eggs anyway you like, your choice of breakfast meat, and a single pancake (or home fries + toast). I love that they have so many breakfast meats beyond the basic 3 even offering tofu. I tried Uncle Charley's Hot Sausage, and I wish I ordered 2 more... Tasty and personally, not that spicy!  * Brussels Sprout Bowl ($13.00): Cheesy grits topped with saut√©ed shaved Brussels sprouts, braised leeks, bacon, mushrooms and 1 egg over easy  I'm coming back to get a pancake dish. They have a lemon berry ricotta, pumpkin walnut, and cinnamon bun pancake... doesn't that sound so good?"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. The service was perfect. The food was delicious (I'm still dreaming of the brussel hash). I would love to see a cafe like this in my neighborhood in NYC!"}
{"text":"In Philly, brunch is like a sport.  We do it well and I am a skilled athlete.  Gold medal Olympic skills son.  Perhaps brunch is not a sport on the other side of the state.  Maybe brunch in the burgh is just an exhibition game?  We went to the square cafe on a Sunday morn.  Brunch was in full swing at this tiny place.  We put our names in and took a quick walk around the block.  Back at the cafe, the place was still hopping.  We were a party of 3, difficult to seat when places are busy.  They sat another threesome at a large table and the waitress came over and asked if we wanted to share the table to reduce our wait time.  Sure.  No worries.  Even though we sat at the same table, we exchanged a few smiles with our table buddies and said nothing the rest of the time.  Kinda weird.  Anyways, the menu was full of options.  I had a hard time deciding, but went with a western omelet.  My friends went with nutella and banana crepes and a veggie omelet.    The staff was good.  The omelet was ok.  The potatoes that came with the omelet were so so.  They were kind of a downer actually.  There was a hitch with the crepes, but they were quickly fixed.  The waitress was really nice and attentive.  Odd because our table buddies complained about her to management.  Then again, they complained about everything in their lives, or at least when I chose to listen in, that was all I heard.  I was told this is one of few places to get an awesome brunch in Pittsburgh.  Perhaps because of that, I was a bit let down.  If back around these parts, I will probably look elsewhere.  Its just not a fair match for me."}
{"text":"v yum  they served us with only 5 minutes before closing time.  5 star service"}
{"text":"Square Caf√© was recommended as 'the best' place in Pittsburgh for breakfast, so expectations were extremely high, especially with so many other really good breakfast options in the area. Unfortunately, my experience here did not live up to those expectations. My meal was good and my guests enjoyed their meal as well. The staff was friendly and helpful. Perhaps some of my disappointment is with the menu which is what I would classify as too avant-garde for what I was looking for this particular morning. At breakfast, I prefer the traditional favorites, while this menu focuses on some really experimental flavors. For me, I would find this place more enjoyable at lunch rather than dinner."}
{"text":"This is a nice little spot for a morning or afternoon bite. I had bought  groupon earlier that week and decided to take go on a sunny friday afternoon. It's really busy on Saturday and Sundays so I try to go during the weekdays.   My hubby called off on friday so I was lucky enough that he could join me. We arrived shortly before 2, found  a parking spot right in front. Lucky us! i was wearing my sweats and felt a little under dressed but i didn't let that bother me. My money is as green as the next persons. We walked into a onslaught of bright and bubbly colors. Oranges, blues, greens and my favorite color red. We walked to the bar where a barista greeted us and asked which seat we'd prefer to sit in. I liked the high back seats at the bar so we choose to sit there. The bar itself help a  lovely grey top that kind of neutralized all the bright colors and gave it a really retro feel.  When our menu came i ordered the veggie omelette and my hubby ordered the omelette that comes with fingerling potatoes and some greens. My omelette was ok, nothing special but i could definitely taste all the fresh veggies but i guess the omelette had no salt or was cooked in cooking spray because it lacked that good egg flavor that only butter or oil can bring out. My hubbys omelette on the other hand was very good. Those fingerling potatoes tasted sooooo good. They were soft and perfectly cooked and blended into the omelette. My side dish was ciabatta bread and home fries and he ordered extra wheat toast with his greens(salad). I was sad about my potatoes because they came out cold and lacked that crispy crunch you enjoy when they are fresh. His salad was really good and came with a homemade lemon and oil dressing which i loved. Lemon is a flavor my taste buds cannot resist.  After finishing our meals we noticed a list of espresso with some really interesting combinations. We settled on the unicorn which comes with lavender and vanilla. All i can say is mmh mmmh mmmmmmhhhh!! I'm not much of a coffee drinker but this drink tasted more like a hot chocolate than coffee. I enjoyed how smooth it was  and the barista lauren who waited on us divulged that she came up with the menu. I was very happy that she was the one who not only created my drink but served it up as well. The service was great, the atmosphere was really comfortable, I do however wish that my potatoes were fresher."}
{"text":"Breakfast food is my favorite type of food. Square cafe is one of my favorite breakfast places. Really good food. Generally good service. They seem to always have interesting specials. The place is pretty big, and has a lot of outdoor seating.   I have had several breakfast items, and really enjoy their savory items, like the Veggie Omelet, but I think they are really good at the sweet items. French toast sticks with a caramel sauce was a special once, and they were AMAZING. I also really appreciate their special options, as they always offer something different and good.  Their coffee is pretty good too.  Will and have been back and its a place to take friends."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here this past week. The service was excellent. Everybody was so attentive and I could tell the owners spend a lot of time training their staff. The place was packed and not once did the staff miss a water or coffee refill. I had the breakfast sandwich and I was extremely underwhelmed. I thought the presentation was incredibly sloppy and looked like it had been made by my two year old daughter. The bread was over buttered and under toasted and the sausage was falling out( only one small sausage link cut up in the entire sandwich). The cheese was 3/4 outside of the bread. There was no garnish or fruit are anything that came with it. For $9.50 I would have expected for it to be a little more filling. Perhaps a small side of hashbrowns or a little something extra should have been included. I left hungry. Props for excellent service but just ok food in my opinion."}
{"text":"Visiting in town over the long Thanksgiving holiday weekend.  Was about 20-30 minute wait for seven people around 10:30-11:00 on a Saturday.  Understandable since it is a small space with not many big tables.  Great service - staff was knowledgeable and attentive, but not intrusive.  I had the andouille sausage / cheddar grits, with a johnnycake on the side.  Both were fantastic.  I am not normally a grits fan because they are bland when plain, but these had a great flavor.  Try them before they rotate the menu items.  Don't forget to check Facebook for the secret word / phrase of the day for free bottomless house coffee!"}
{"text":"You can pig out AND feel healthy/hot guilty about it? Sign.Me.Up!  I've been here twice and I've enjoyed both experiences.  Most recently, my boyfriend and I were here for brunch on Saturday.  We had about a 30 minute wait (y'all know my feelings about waiting for food, but it wasn't that bad) and were eventually seated in a larger booth with another two-some at the opposite end.  It would have been nice to be asked if this seating arrangement was okay, but I would have agreed regardless so I guess that's a moot point.  Anyway..  I ordered the Brussels Sprout Hash and he got the Cornmeal Pancakes (with a side of bacon - can't be THAT healthy ALL the time).  The hash was delicious.  It was served over cheesy grits and had sauteed Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, and pancetta.  The grits weren't so cheesy that I couldn't actually taste the grits and the veggies were cooked so there was still some snap to them - perfect.  I just wish the Brussels sprouts were smaller and more flavorful.  These were the big honkin' ones that don't taste like much.  I hit a wall with a few forkfuls of grits left but I still managed to eat some pancakes.  They were delicious - hearty, flavorful, a little gritty (in a nice textural way), and surprisingly fluffy.  Also are gluten-free.  The coffee is good and served in thick mugs.  The servers are friendly and efficient.  The bacon vanilla shake will be mine next time."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised at all the stellar reviews on yelp, which is why I visited. Regent square must not have many places to choose from because while not bad, the food was nothing special--typical diner fare--and overpriced at that. I'd have given it another star if the prices were more in line with what they're serving."}
{"text":"Went to Square Cafe on a Saturday around 11 expecting a long wait. I went in to give my name and was a little confused as to if I went somewhere or if I waited for someone to come around. The lady took my name after I asked her, \"can I give you my name\" and she took it. Forgot to ask how long it would take but we figured we'd chance it and run across the street to check out the beer case at D's. We left just in time as when we got back to Square Cafe the woman came outside and called our name.  After looking over the menu the dining partner ordered the Square Breakfast with over easy eggs, chicken apple sausage, home fries and ciabatta. I ordered the spinach pancetta omelet. I was delicious stuffed with feta cheese. We liked Square Cafe because it was something different and special for a nice brunch. It reminded me of Coca Cafe, not a place you would go every week but a treat you can look forward to!"}
{"text":"I had a power protein shake which was good. Also had the chorizo bowl... Tasty but nothing special. My mom had the Asian salad which was really disappointing. The ingredients were not fresh to the point of almost being inedible."}
{"text":"I came across Square Cafe, because they were offering some great deals on Groupon. I was extremely surprised to walk into such a cute cafe (you never know what you'll find on Groupon). There was a small wait time and it was crowded. So we opted to head straight for two empty seats at the counter. No wait time and quick service! They had outside sidewalk seating, normally I would have preferred to eat outside, but I was STARVING!  Besides being super cute and popular, the food is very good. They have a lot of healthier options, which I found refreshing. Also, they offer some really great typical items (like the breakfast burritos and pancakes). They have lattes, smoothies, and milkshakes as well. I ordered the Chorizo Benedict for my meal and I couldn't pass on trying a latte. They have the coolest mugs! Check out how they stack them next to all the coffee making machines at the counter... very cool.  I already know I'm coming back here, soon."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast spot. It's great for everyone including my wild toddler who loves the thick sliced bacon! They always have a great menu of unique lattes and I'm currently loving the Whoopie Pie flavor. The have great standard fare like the Square breakfast- eggs, toast, bacon, and home fries and more lively dishes like the chorizo bowl- tater tots topped with chorizo, peppers, grape tomatoes and a half an avocado.  Delicious everyday and they cater too!"}
{"text":"I was such a fan of this restaurant that I went to breakfast on both Saturday and Sunday! Both times there was a wait of about 15-20 minutes, but that is to be expected since the restaurant is not very large. On Saturday I ordered the crab and avocado omelet and on Sunday I ordered a breakfast sandwich on chibatta bread with bacon, smoked Gouda and eggs. Both meals were fabulous, but if I had to chose one I would say the omelet was superior. The sandwich was pretty straight forward, and if a place is known for breakfast, it is pretty hard to mess up. The omelet though was unlike any I have ever had. It was full of crab meat and topped with a creme fresh reduction. It was one of the best omelets I have ever had. Also both times I ordered an Iced Vanilla Chai tea with soy milk and it was really good. They have a huge drink menu though, filled with very interesting drinks that you don't see all the time. My brother in law ordered the Gingerbread Chai tea and said it was very tasty. All in all, I had a great meal both mornings and would recommend this place ."}
{"text":"Nothing special in the flavor area but it is fast and clean. Just average.  Glad I tried it but probably wouldn't come back for lunch,  maybe breakfast.  I had the fire braised chicken sandwich, i guess I expected more flavor from the menu description."}
{"text":"So, I've heard about this place and I've wanted to stop by.  However, every time I go past the restaurant, the line is out the door and down the street.  I just don't have that kind of patience anymore, especially when it's the type of neighborhood place where people don't have a problem lingering over ham and eggs for hours.  You know that type of place... \"Come sit down with your New York Times crossword puzzle and take as long as you need.\"  Good for generating neighborly camaraderie, but bad for folks who just want to eat good food and go!  Well, during a recent bank holiday (President's Day to be exact!), my daughter Muff and I had the chance to stop in and eat without waiting in a line.  Yippee!  Skippee!  (It didn't hurt that it was probably 1 degree outside at 8:00am).  We were seated quickly and I honestly couldn't make up my mind as to what to eat.  Muff quickly settled on the Pumpkin Walnut Pancakes and Chicken Apple Sausage.  I kept scanning the dining room to see what looked appealing in person.  Finally, I settled on the Crab & Spinach Crepes with a Fruit Cup.  As stated in previous posts, I'm a crabmeat fiend.  My only hesitation is that some people don't know the difference between a crepe and a pancake. (There's lesson here for self-taught chefs who don't know the basics.)  The last thing that I wanted to eat what a mile high \"pancakey crepe\" with crabmeat, mushrooms, spinach and parmesan cheese sauce.  Yuck!  This dish was not that.  It was delicious with real crabmeat and not that weird fake stuff.  Nothing was overwhelming and everything melded together nicely. The fruit cup was also a nice accompaniment to the crepes and  was also a wonderful \"dead of winter\" touch.  Someone actually took the time to cut fresh fruit. (I know that sounds crazy, but do you know how often fresh fruit comes straight from the can?)  Muff's pumpkin walnut pancakes and chicken apple sausage were also nicely comforting and delicious.  Square Caf√© is a nice homey place where you can tell the owners and staff care about their food and their customers.  I guess that I'm just jealous that I don't have a similar place nearby that serves high quality ingredients in a relaxed atmosphere.    Hey Square Care owners, can you open a place near me?"}
{"text":"Hopefully I can re-review this review another time. I arrived for a late breakfast with my son, we sat outside, coffee and OJ arrived quickly. So, I thought good start right? Well, I was wrong. His meal came out just as quick and so did mines. However, his was cooked and mines not at all.   I ordered the Pumpkin pancake, and it was RAW! I waited nearly 10 minutes for a wait staff, and eventually went to seek one on my own to let them know.   They were truly kind about the matter, and quickly brought out a new one. Unfortunately that too was raw, pasty and flat. I didn't even bother putting it in my mouth. I showed the waiter, he too agreed that it was raw, apologized and took the $4 off my bill. Unfortunately that was it , so I left with a stomach filled with only coffee and a $17 and change tab to pay for waiting 30 minutes for a meal I could eat."}
{"text":"It really is about as good as it gets as far as breakfast joints go in Pittsburgh.  We often don't enjoy eating out for breakfast for the simple reason its often nothing special.  Square Cafe is a refreshing change of course.  They have the breakfast staples, yet manage to execute them better.  Not greasy, always fresh, and always leave happy.  They do a lot of twists to make things more interesting.  My personal favorite are their takes on eggs Benedict.  Their summer menu had it made with beef short ribs and side of salad greens.  The fall version uses crab cakes with a side of salad greens.  It is a perfect breakfast, tasty, hardy, but not overwhelming.  Their crepes, pancakes, and anything they do with smoked salmon are also great.  They have brew a great cup of coffee as well.  Their breakfast prices are somewhat more than some other establishments, but its worth it.  We always leave feeling that we made a right choice for breakfast."}
{"text":"Brunch time!  My wife and I were definitely a fan of the Square Cafe.  This review has been a long time coming since I almost forgot I had eaten here.  FOR SHAME! We really enjoyed sitting outside on the sidewalk in the cozy little neighborhood of Regent Square while sipping Squares quality coffee and having a nice brunch.  The service was great and friendly and our food was almost very very good.  I had the Square Protein breakfast with eggs that were oozing that yolky goodness.  And my better half had an omelete with spinach and feta, she didn't speak much during the meal, so that's a plus.  LOL.   I would highly recommend spending a nice late morning/early afternoon meal outside of Square. I also heard they have tons of vegan and vegetarian options, but why?!"}
{"text":"Extremely underwhelming. My Brussels sprout hash was hardly cooked. The mushrooms and Brussels sprouts were nearly raw and had no flavor. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and coffee. The restaurant itself is really cute. There's a chalkboard people draw on in the bathroom too, which is not super special or anything, I know, but it's the little things that make cafes like this fun.   There's a nice coffee bar to sit at if you're by yourself too.   I had the short rib omelette which was very good. The coffee is good too and they come in these cute \"square\" mugs.   Seating is indoor and outdoor, but if you're sitting outside there are some awkward moments when people are parallel parking next to you. Otherwise, it's fine.   As with any brunch place in a trendy neighborhood, be prepared for a wait on weekends! On weekdays, seating is plentiful, and they open early."}
{"text":"After getting over paying $4 for 2 biscuits I got comfortable with the scene. The food is great. I had the special of the day and destroyed my crab cake sliders in record timing. I'm glad before ordering it I asked the stranger next to me how he was enjoying his because he was right it did need a little bit more sauce. I ordered extra sauce and drizzled it over the crab cake and it was necessary. It also elevated it quite a bit. The first time I was here I had breakfast and a smoothie and it was delicious. This go around I decided to try their lattes. The Rocky Road one was okay. It wasn't sweet enough but I guess that's a matter of preference. I like my espresso to taste flavorful with a splash of coffee. The staff here are pretty awesome and accommodating as my friend who I was with was pretty demanding about her hash and the bread it came with. I'd definitely say this place is up there with Pamela's Diner it's just a bit pricier."}
{"text":"I'm serious about my breakfast and this place lived up to every expectation. I love to try to make healthier versions of my favorite foods and they seem to do that with some of their options as well. The atmosphere was really nice. Located on a somewhat busy street, the outdoor seating did not feel like it at all and the cozy tables made me nostalgic for the quaint cafes located on the streets of Paris. The staff was friendly and the place was bright and cheery.    My husband ordered the chorizo bowl and loved it. It's hard to go wrong with eggs, meat, cheese, and veggies on a bed of tots.    I ordered the pearly white omelet (which was more of a scramble but i don't care about titles). The pesto was such a nice touch and they let me swap the tomatoes for mushrooms with no problem. I'm a little hesitant when fruit cup is offered because it's never fresh but their fruit was so crisp and delicious. After much of my own experiments with protein pancakes, i know that they can be pretty dense but they kept a good amount of fluff and the chocolate chips were a nice touch! I love that they offer a single pancake because i never like to get the pancakes for my meal because it's always just a bit too much for me in terms of sweet and since food is my love language, i love to try as many things on the menu as possible.   If you're in Pittsburgh, this place is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I love LOVE the square cafe! it's such a cozy little cafe filled with neat local artists work and they offer amazing drinks and food!   i had their pumpkin chi tea and it fit right into my tea fetish! it's creamy and full of spicy flavor, way better than Starbucks chi tea.          I always get the shrimp and crab cake sandwich, it's filling and the taste is just what you want out of sandwich. It's food you know is made of a good quality and they offer good vegetarian options.         If your like me and tired of nasty second rate chain restaurant food then you feel right at home here!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot with plenty of vegetarian and vegan options. The line builds up early on weekends so get there as soon as you can or you may find yourself waiting 30+ minutes (I once had to wait over an hour). However, I've frequented this restaurant many times while attending college in Pittsburgh and any potential wait time is definitely worth the wait. I'd recommend starting off with some coffee, served in their signature square mugs. Then, I typically get the veggie scramble with goat cheese as my entree. This is served with toast, a couple orange slices, and home fries. The legendary home fries are HANDS DOWN the main reason I've frequented Square Cafe so much. The potatoes are the perfect level of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a nice seasoning of salt and pepper. I may even go as far to say I like these potatoes more than Pamela's potato hash... but you can be the judge of that on your next brunch here ;)"}
{"text":"The theme of this place is a little useless:  there are many things in the cafe that are shaped like squares of rectangles, including the mugs -- which I feel are a pain to drink coffee from, and I like my coffee comfortalbe.  They have vintage lunchboxes on display on their wall, so be prepared to have them become the center of your conversation every time you go there because The Last Starfighter will spark a blast from the past.  You should do that over one of their cookies because their baked goods are off tha hook.  I went with a big group of my boyfriend's friends on New Year's Day after a night of partying, and they were open!  Everyone's food looked delicious.  I ordered the green eggs breakfast which may sound like barf-o-rama but actually was phenomenal: the green comes from pesto."}
{"text":"As cute as the Square Cafe is, it just just kind of... square. I visited the cafe during July, so my group of three wanted to sit outside. The inside was kind of tight, anyway. We waited for over 45 minutes to get a table and awkward around all of the people sitting outside but there wasn't anywhere else to stand. When we were finally seated, it took our server forever to even bring us our drinks. Later, when the food finally arrived, I was disappointed. If I'm going to wait for an hour and a half in total to get my food, it better be amazing. This was pretty average."}
{"text":"It's been ages since I have been to Square Cafe...when I say ages - I mean years.  But I had a surprise Friday off - so it was a perfect day to meet a friend for a scrumptious breakfast.  We were looking for a place close to both of us that wasn't a chain - I finally remembered Square Cafe and was so glad I did!  While it was a Friday at breakfast time (8:30a) we were easily able to get an inside table.  Unfortunately it was a little too chilly to take advantage of the outside tables.  But I very much look forward to taking advantage of them soon!  Our waitress was awesome, the food was amazing.  The best part - they didn't mind that we sat there for a bit longer to chat.  My friend got a coffee - they even offered her a cup of it to go!  Anyways - get to Square Cafe.  It is SO good, so fun, and so worth it."}
{"text":"We visited Square two times last month, and we are happy to report that we had a great experience. The service was great, and the food was delicious. Whatever was going awry last summer seems to have been transient. Square, you're back on my list!"}
{"text":"A really cool place to go to eat, and the food is good.  They have some outside seating which is nice on beautiful days!   I had the Hazelnut Espresso pancakes, they were really good.   I'd love to go there for Brunch sometime."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday. It was quite busy, so there was about a half hour wait. We were a large party, so it was expected. The inside has a cute and friendly vibe. My friend and I shared the breakfast burrito and cinnamon roll pancakes. The breakfast burrito was excellent as the tortilla was seasoned with spices, which really made a difference. The burrito was filled with eggs, mushrooms, cheese, onions and came with sour cream and salsa. The cinamon roll pancakes were beautifully presented as they had a swirl pattern and drizzled with a cream cheese frosting. They also tasted amazing as well. The prices are very reasonable, too. A great place to grab brunch!"}
{"text":"Why did I ever give this place less than five stars?  Try the...try it all.  Funky fun and love it here."}
{"text":"Regent Square is never a 'destination' of mine, unless I actually hear of something interesting playing at the Regent Square Theater. Regent Square is usually a 'pass through' en route to the Habitat for Humanity Restore, or a cut off the parkway heading for Squirrel Hill. But this morning a friend was braving the blizzard for an acupuncture session in Regent Square, and we hit the Square Cafe for breakfast.  I had seen the lines when occasionally passing through, and had seen previous reviews talking about the place being packed with a wait, so this morning the blizzard was serendipitous to our being able to get in with no problems.   We only had about 30 minutes to order, eat and run, and so we did just that. First came the coffee...not bad...not quite a thick rich cup that my mouth generally prefers (I am a big fan of coffee with coffee in it, like Cuban, Turkish, Arabic - not just brown Pittsburgh water) but it wasn't just (as my late best friend and I used to call it) TEAffee. It was a decent cup of morning Joe-merican. I do have to say that the coffee cups were a little weird, and took some adjusting to drink out of.  Prices? A little high for breakfast, but manageable. I didn't have a lot of time to scope all of the options, but in the time that I did have, I looked through the crepes and egg options, trying to keep carbs at a minimum. Most of the descriptions included either 'onions' or 'peppers', which my stomach can't handle at the best of times, definitely not for breakfast, and although some of them looked good if the onions or peppers weren't there, I didn't have time to play Meg Ryan in 'When Harry Met Sally', so I just opted for what I knew I could have, and ordered the chicken crepe with leeks.  Very tasty, decent size. I did kind of get the feeling that perhaps the crepe had been pre-made and then filled, because portions of the crepe were definitely cold, whereas the filling was quite piping hot. Nonetheless, it was a delicious and filling quick breakfast option.   The waitress was excellent, fast, friendly, and accommodating, even allowing us to take what was left of our coffee to go, since we were running late for his poking appointment (as we drank coffee, my mind envisioned him getting acupuncture, and then like a cartoon, erupting like a coffee sprinkler system), and she topped off the paper cups for us.   Now I'm not so sure that I would wait in a line for very long for a table, or that I would say 'Hey, let's go THERE for breakfast' since I don't live in the area. But if I was in the area, and another natural disaster prevented the trendy throngs from leaving their houses to stand in a line for some eggs, I'd certainly give it another go."}
{"text":"i would have never even known about this place had i not stumbled upon it in a deck of city dining cards. i'm very glad i did. for the dining cards to give you the discount, you have to spend at least $30. i went with a friend, and we had to order 3 entrees and 2 coffee drinks to even get there! needless to say, the prices are reasonable. i just had a simple coffee, but my friend had some sort of pumpkin latte which was very tasty. we ordered the mediterranean omelet (delish.. anything with feta is good with me), the canadian bacon and avocado crepe (combination i never would have thought of but was blown away by), and the mac 'n' cheese (i can't remember what gourmet cheese was on it, but it was good, although kind of bland.. we added salt and pepper). the omelet came with toast and home fries and the mac 'n' cheese with \"greens\" (mixed greens sprinkled with a little dressing on the side.. not a full salad, but you get the idea). i'd definitely go back, although let me explain the two reasons i gave the place 4 instead of 5 stars. first, the mac 'n' cheese, like i mentioned was rather bland. it wasn't bad, but after trying the first two we were quite disappointed. second, about half way through the meal, they randomly opened the door and left it open. we were sitting at the bar, pretty much right in front of the door and it was freezing outside. we asked them to close it and they did, but really? it's winter, how was that a good idea?"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places! They have a ton of vegan/vegetarian/gluten-free options which is great. They can get pretty crowded on the weekends, so visit them on a weekday morning if you can. Order the brussel sprout hash!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food with lots of vegan/vegetarian options.  Moderately priced and haven't had to wait for a table.  Service is always friendly and knowledgeable.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because they don't have avocados as an option.  My own personal bias, but I love that lesbians come here :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast here two days this past weekend. First day had the tofu scramble which is not scrambled tofu, but rather cubed tofu over \"riced\" cauliflower. I very much enjoyed having a vegetarian option for breakfast that wasn't pancakes. Next morning I had a veggie omelet with the pearl cheese that they make in house. My dining companion had the pulled pork special over grits and liked it as well. Make no mistake, this is a very busy place but the service is top-notch. Especially appreciated the guys at the counter on Saturday. Very pleasant."}
{"text":"Back again!! Sat inside today..... slightly chilly out but as we were leaving I noticed many guests had the same blue blankets on! So cute.   I don't like sitting inside as much but there wasn't a wait. It's just a little too close for comfort. Kinda noisy. But all in an upbeat kinda way.   But. The. Food. Oh man. Totally makes up for it. Got the braised short rib crepes and they were phenomenal. Savory amazingness. Also had the churry (?) chai beverage. Wow. Sooo good.   Our server was super awesome as well. Square Cafe is always a good call :)"}
{"text":"Usually a wait here for brunch, and not a lot of room on the street to stand and wait with the rest of the crowd. Otherwise, the food is pretty good, I like the Brussel sprouts hash and their juices! They have had a group for a while, it's a really incredible deal for good food if it's still there!"}
{"text":"This place is in my neighborhood and, on prime brunch days, there is ALWAYS a line spilling out of the restaurant and into the street. To be honest, I'm not really sure why? I've eaten here twice and both times I left underwhelmed.   I don't mind paying premium prices for meals that reflect the price point but Square Cafe seems needlessly expensive. Four dollars extra for a croissant? You can get an expertly baked croissant at the French bakery down the street for less money than that. Literally. Square Cafe also doesn't participate in the widely accepted breakfast/brunch tradition of including a toast and potato option with one's entree of choice- instead requiring people pay an additional $6.25 ON TOP of a \"meal\" that is already setting you back $9-$15.  I think two tries is more than fair enough. I honestly prefer the Swissvale Eat n Park. Shrug."}
{"text":"A-OK  Had the brussel hash. Very good, large portion. Added an extra egg.   Just wish the dish included cheesy/more cheesy grits. I actually ordered through UberEATS. Food was hot upon arrival, and delish.   Will definitely order or go to try more of the dishes."}
{"text":"The food was good, but not great (I had the vegetable crepes and my husband had the breakfast sandwich). Maybe we ordered the wrong items - but I think that if we want breakfast, we will be sticking with Pamela's."}
{"text":"After going to Square Cafe twice during peak brunch times, I have resolved to come early in the morning, which is perfect. Nice selection of breakfast items from your sweet to savory and for reasonable prices though I feel like they have changed the menu recently so that there are less items. Anyway I don't get the name of the cafe but there are shapes (not just squares) painted on the ceiling in bold colors with local art work hanging so it is a comfortable atmosphere.   The service has been good - coffee is always filled (cups that the coffee come in are shaped interestingly cool) and the waitresses check in at reasonable times with a smile on their face. They are there to get you in and out with a full belly due to the volume of customers.  I've eaten quite a few of their scrambles and omlettes along with their home fries and toast. The combinations of the flavors work well and homefries don't need any additional seasoning unless ketchup. Pancakes are fluffy and sweet, love how there is a dallop of whipped butter and whip cream. I have yet to have the french toast but my boyfriend always orders them with strawberries.  This is a staple breakfast place for us."}
{"text":"So I'm having a difficult time with this review.  I went here around 1 on a weekday, and I was feeling a veggie burger.  All of the omelette, pancake, and crepe options sounded delicious to me, but I ordered the veggie burger and fries. The fries were awesome, but the burger was just okay for me. I blame myself because I should have gotten a breakfast item from the menu.  All of the tables around me ordered breakfast items and their dishes looked wonderful.  Our service was pretty average, and the atmosphere was fun.  I will have to go back and get something for breakfast one of these days for a second opinion!"}
{"text":"We had a large party and needed two highchairs, and even though Square Cafe doesn't take reservations they will make a \"note\" of your party's size and arrival time if you call a few days before hand, which we did and they were able to accommodate us. The hostess was great and worked with us to get us seated as soon as our whole party arrived.   Our waitress was friendly and made sure we understood the surcharge on eggs due to the current avian flu shortage. She refilled coffee and waters in a timely manner, and provided the toddler with us crayons and an activity place mat which was very much appreciated.   Everyone enjoyed their breakfasts and one member of our party really like that she could substitute the buttermilk pancake for a cinnamon swirl pancake with the square breakfast, for an additional charge. Also, the variety of sausage available almost made me change my order from bacon to the chicken apple sausage, oh well next time...   My sunny side up eggs and home fries hit the spot, and my husband DEVOURED his Say Uncle Hot Sausage Hash. Overall, everyone at the table was pleased with their meals.   We'll definitely be back, because I still need to try that chicken apple sausage."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming to this restaurant! The staff (who doesn't appear to turn over--a testament to the ownership) is constantly friendly, despite not being a \"regular\" I'm in enough that they always remember me and greet me with a smile, not to mention the coffee is always flowing! I've never had a bad meal here! Lima bean bisque, Ruben pirogies! You name it. One of these days I'm going to buy a coffee mug too, they're incredible."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch/breakfast several times, I'm lucky that it's only a 15 minute walk from my apartment.  The last time I came for lunch it was busy. There was a wait for a table so we sat at the bar. Ten minutes after we placed our order a woman came up to the bar and complained that her food was taking a long time, the barista kindly explained that everyone's food was taking longer than usual and it will be out as soon as it's ready.  Fifteen minutes later a server came to us with two plates, but only one was correct. I told her that the dish in her other hand was not what I ordered, so she gave my friend her french toast with strawberries (which she loved). My server appeared out of nowhere and all ready knew the situation. She said that the food runner must have given us another customer's order and that my dish would take a little bit longer. I thanked her and told her it was no big deal and I didn't mind waiting. Five minutes later my asparagus and goat cheese scramble arrived, and it was well worth the wait. Although I am not a fan of sun dried tomatoes; next time I will see if they can make it without. Our server apologized profusely for the mistake. I'm a server as well, and I know these mistakes happen. It didn't bother me one bit. A few minutes later our server surprised us with 2 strawberry graham cracker milkshakes!! Although I am gluten intolerant (which she did not know), the gesture was greatly appreciated (and my friend was ok with taking mine home!).  The white bean hash is my favorite thing here! It is gluten free also! It has a ton of flavor and textures and eggs are always cooked perfectly. My friend said the pumpkin spiced latte was the best she has ever had.   This restaurant consistently serves quality meals with great flavor at a fair price. The servers and baristas are personable, friendly, and down to earth. Make sure to stop in and try it if you haven't!"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying out this place for some time now. It was a beautiful day and outdoor seating was available. When I arrived I was told to have a seat at one of the small tables.   I was having a hard time deciding whether or not to go for breakfast or lunch but then decided to do sort of a mix. I ordered the chicken crepes with mushrooms and Asiago cheese. I learned that they promote other small businesses in some of their menu offerings and the cheese on my crepes was homemade. I got my food fairly quickly. Although I couldn't see the crepes for the cheese it was so good!! They have some new offerings on their spring menu including some vegetarian choices.   I was chatting at the next table with someone who had ordered the chicken salad in paninis. It came with French Fries. He told me it was delicious! The place wasn't overly crowded when I arrived and I saw they have two gender neutral bathrooms.  Expect to pay anywhere over $10.00 for your meal but when I compare it against some of the chain restaurants that  charge the same amount you get more bang for your buck here. The food is indeed filling but in case you have room then they serve milkshakes and smoothies. Kids' meals are a flat $6.50. They also do catering here.  Also along their walls they put up various artwork which is for sale. Online ordering is also available. Some of the local vendors they promote are Emerald Valley artisans, King's pearl cheese, and Nancy B's bakery. One final note which is most often overlooked on the menu. There is a sharing fee of $2.50. Please be aware of that when ordering. I am anxious to return sometime in the future to try out their breakfasts. I was told the Brussels sprouts hash is what they are noted for."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  Why is this place super popular?  The coffee is killer and the service *can be* excellent... but the food is mega over priced and mediocre at best.    I've attempted this place a couple times, ordering totally different dishes and have given up.  Either they don't understand how to make food flavorful, or they don't care.    Pancakes shouldn't be batter in the middle, a veggie breakfast burrito SHOULD NOT be $11...unless it's the size of a toddler, a breakfast tofu scramble should not have blocks of saut√©ed tofu in it (are you new?), and I shouldn't spend $40 on breakfast for two people...no booze involved, just food.    I really wanted to like this place but it's honestly not worth it."}
{"text":"Tasty! I had a smoked salmon crepe, my wife had veggie, both excellent. Close to the Frick museum, 1 hr on street parking is free**  **Update 7/23/2014**  Square Cafe sent me a message that the parking isn't timed, so even more reason to visit!  Also wanted to add, our waiter was excellent."}
{"text":"First time at Square Cafe was today for brunch. Couldn't have selected a better place. Started off with the Moroccan mint tea which was fantastic! It took me a good 15 min to narrow down my menu selection. I just couldn't  decide which yummy dish to try. I end up getting the Square breakfast with a side of French toast. The French Toast so was so fresh, light an fluffy!  The bacon an potatoes were perfectly cooked. I can't wait to go back!  Awesome food, great service, super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for Square Cafe that was set to expire, so we were really excited to try it out. There was a line out the door, but we only waited a couple minutes to be seated. The atmosphere was awesome, with brightly colored walls adorned with locally painted artwork. The square-shaped coffee cups also added to the unique experience - especially since their coffee was fantastic.   They don't poach or baste eggs, so my wife ordered scrambled egg whites, which were covered in grease. I ordered an omelet with ham, salsa, and their \"King's Pearl\" cheese, which we were told was similar to feta, but actually was more like ricotta. I'll be honest, I hate ricotta cheese, so I wasn't a fan of it. I understand that some people may like it, but it just wasn't for me. I can't blame them for that.   What I can blame the kitchen for though is that I asked twice for salsa on the side, because I didn't want my eggs smothered in it, and then we both asked for our toast well done, explaining that we like it really crispy. When the food came, the bread was barely toasted and the eggs were covered in salsa. It would have taken too long to ask for the bread to be toasted more, so we just ate it.   I hate giving low ratings, but we just weren't very happy with our breakfast. I don't like to be all negative, so I will say the waitress was very friendly, the coffee was great, and the inside atmosphere was awesome. Other than that, I can't justify going back."}
{"text":"Go, just go to Square Cafe! You don't need to read more reviews!  Attention to detail is on point and it's obvious when you order take out. Food is always cooked properly, eggs are perfect and CRISPY bacon.   I always try to make it to this restaurant every time I visit Pitt and I'm ALWAYS happy when I go there. Have only had their breakfast and coffee and I can only imagine how delicious their other menu items are!"}
{"text":"I found my new breakfast spot...The employees are very welcoming it feels like you're in good company, and the food was GREAT!!! We had the square breakfast and Lemon Berry ricotta pancakes oh my goodness the pancakes were too die for. I can't wait to explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and have not been disappointed yet. The service has been prompt and friendly. They have a huge selection of tea and coffee drinks. Their menu is amazing. They have a huge selection of savory and sweet breakfast items.  I got the lemon ricotta pancakes the first time, and they were fluffy and flavorful. Then I got the breakfast sandwich the second time which was really good too.   This has quickly become one of my favorite breakfast places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Square Cafe offers gluten free options. During my last visit, our server was knowledgeable about Celiac disease and had working knowledge of cooking surfaces and cross contamination. For example, I personally could not order GF pancakes because they are cooked on the same surface as wheat pancakes. Our server checked in the kitchen and I was able to find items on the menu that won't make me sick.  I has the Pesto Chicken Salad with lemon honey dressing and a side of bacon. I ate it all. Phenomenal. Everyone in my party was pleased.  A must go for a great East End breakfast."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and I am so glad that I did! I have been here three times now. I admit it, all three times I ordered the same exact thing- the crab spinach omelet. However, for my cafe choices, I did venture out and tried a different espresso drink each time. The raspberry has to be my absolute favorite, its sweet and loaded with caffeine.. JUST PERFECT.  The seating can be difficult since all three times we've came here that its always packed. We choose to sit at the bar stools just so we didn't have to wait too long. As we were eating, many people would come in, look at the crowd, and leave because they decided not to wait. To those people, i say NAY! Wait the 15-30 mins for a table, the food is absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"It's crazy what people do for eggs and bacon. Getting a table on a weekend is like the Hunger Games: brunch edition. We rolled up pretty early (or so we thought) and the entire block was filled with people waiting to be seated. Fortunately the wait wasn't as long as expected but we still stood around for at least half an hour twiddling our thumbs.   Although everyone raves about their pancakes, I came specifically for the tandoori jackfruit bowl (aaaand also the pancakes). To my disappointment, I hated it! The jackfruit was extremely salty to the point that it was inedible. It came with some kale and other misc veggies so there was no real base to offset all the salt. I also ordered the protein pancake that tasted like cardboard. I definitely regretted not going with a regular pancake.  Our waitress was so sweet and friendly, but naturally with so many people to manage, we felt neglected most of the time. It took forever to get served because the kitchen was backed up. Our table was squeezed next to another couple, so trying to have a conversation with another one going on 5 inches away was quite uncomfortable. If I ever come back, it's going to be for take-out."}
{"text":"The Square Cafe gets really busy on weekends, which is a tell-tale sign that this place is not messing around when it comes to food. I've never ordered something I haven't liked, and the service is always on point. They have a nice selection of beverages, and I will never forget the breakfast tostada they had on special the first time I came!!"}
{"text":"Adorable. Laid Back. Delicious.  The staff is friendly and the place is clean and has lots of character.  The omelette ranchero is so good I struggle to leave my comfort zone.  The square mugs keep coffee hot , delicious, and eclectic.  Becoming my favorite Pittsburgh brunch spot.."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. It's fantastic to have such an amazing diner in our neighborhood. I've never thought to write a review before. The food is always top notch. Never anything short if perfection. Fresh, local ingredients. Homemade and yummy...always!"}
{"text":"Came here for Easter Sunday!  I had told them ahead of time on Facebook that I was coming at 11:30 with four people, that made no difference. Our name was on the list but we still had to wait 20-30 minutes for a table.   I had the vegan pancakes with one of their lattes (they made it vegan for me.) The pancakes were supposed to be peanut butter but they tasted more gingerbread spiced. They were pretty good but not amazing. My mom and brother had the lemon Berry Ricotta pancakes and enjoyed them. My dad had the jackfruit bowl and LOVED it! He wants to recreate it at home. And my friend had their green eggs and ham Special, pesto eggs with asiago cheese and tomatoes. He loved his meal and said it was better than Pamela's/DeLuca's.   I don't know if I'll be back, the vegan pancakes weren't everything I dreamed them to be."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back.   Went here yesterday for brunch with the hubby.  We were told it would be a 15 minute wait, but it was closer to 10 minutes which was nice.    We were seated inside and someone was over right away to take our drink order.  My husband had a sugar free vanilla latte which he enjoyed very much.   He had the bacon avocado omlette and subbed mixed greens for the toast and hash browns.  He really enjoyed it and the bite that I had was delicious and chockfull of toppings.  He did think it was strange that the avocado was not incorporated during the cooking, but I prefered it that way since I don't like warm avocado.   I had the short rib eggs benedict.  This was absolutely out of this world.  The hollindaise actulaly tasted light which is difficult to do considering all of the delicious fat in it.  The short ribs were plentefully and were beautifully accompnied by perfectly cooked eggs.    Like I said can't wait to go back and try more of the menu, but it might be hard for me not to order that delicious eggs benedict again."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to trying out this place after hearing great things from friends and seeing rave reviews on Yelp.   The first time I went was with the groupon. I had their home fries, breakfast chicken quesadilla and the walnut pumpkin pancake. The pancake was amazing - not overly sweet but delicious and satisfying. The quesdilla could have used a little more cheese and hence was a little dry but it was quite hearty. My BF thought the home fries were the best he had ever had, I thought they were good too ;) I thought it was a great deal with the groupon savings.  The second time I went without a groupon and paid full price. This time it seemed a little pricey. I got the mint hot chocolate which was very yummy, but it wasn't nearly as hot as it should have been. I went more classic with the breakfast sandwich which was fine enough, but was a little disappointed that not of the entrees really came with home fries, which is usually standard at breakfast and brunch places. Together the rather basic sandwich, small bowl of cold home fries and hot chocolate was $20+. It was good, but I probably won't go again without a deal or groupon.  Waits on the weekends are quite long and its very busy. The second time we went on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving around 10 AM and were seated at the last empty table at the time."}
{"text":"OH. MY. GAWD!  (This is said in the Chris Farley SNL skit voice)  From the service to the atmosphere to the food, this place is WELL worth the highest possible 5 star rating!!  As the reigning Pancake Queen (how did I get this title? I made it up!) I decided that I would do myself an injustice for not eating pancakes here.  Let me tell you, I was NOT disappointed.  Not in the least!  The Oatmeal Pancakes with peach compote, pecans, powdered sugar and whipped cream was just divine!  I've never had oatmeal pancakes and I think I'm in love!  They were incredible and since they're made with oats I'm just going to go ahead and say they were healthy (they probably weren't, oops).    We also decided to split the Omelet Ranchero.  It was packed with loads of cheesy flavor and a nice helping of salsa on top.  Served with potato's and we were in carb overload!  I almost wish we would have ordered a side of fruit instead of the wheat bread it came with just to redeem the meal into being slightly nutritional.  Whatever though, it was darn good!  The ambiance with bright walls, polka dots and fun modern artwork just matched the bright and cheery attitude of the wait staff.  It made me happy and most importantly, my tummy happy!"}
{"text":"I have been here for brunch on several occasions.  I would recommend that you get there early because you may have to wait.  When waiting there is not an area where you and your guests can stand comfortably because this place is very popular.  The food is delicious and they have a varied menu.  You can bring your friends, parents, and kids to this place.  Great place and great food."}
{"text":"It's a very nice place to have breakfast/brunch with a couple of friends.  Tofu Scramble is good for those who are huge tofu fans.  Green eggs with Ham has a very unique taste which both my boyfriend and I favor!  Their coffee is more than tasty which actually surprised us. Plus, bathroom is clean.  I will suggest to buy their groupon first and go with the coupon.  We bought the option of $13 for $20 value and we will probably go again.   Better go a little early since it's very popular and the line is long.  Wait was 20 mins for us three - we got there before ten and it was pouring !!  By the time we were out of it, the line got even longer. So better go early !!  Serve is nice :P"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times now and am always impressed. It is so nice to have a place with good vegetarian/local options in Regent Square! There are many items on the menu that you won't find elsewhere, which makes it easy to come back to time and time again. On my most recent visit, I rode my bike over from Shadyside, and instead of getting a food coma like I normally do after brunch, I was feeling great afterwards since my meal was not overloaded with grease like many brunch options. I tried the Smoked Salmon Omelet and also got to sample the Veggie Overload Omelet with mozzarella. Both were great! I also recommend the specialty lattes - they are delicious, especially the Snickerdoodle!  The atmosphere is cozy and very cute which its own unique flair. It is very popular for breakfast and lunch (so get there early on the weekends if you don't want to wait), but I can see how it would also be a great to come midday to study or read. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"cant give enough stars. the staff here is remarkable. the are friendly and kind and professional all wrapped up in one. this is a quaint little cafe that offers a nice dining experience. you can eat inside or outside. very casual.  greeted with a smile. we did take out but next time i would love to sit and enjoy the experience. try this place. you will find the diamond in the rough. thank you to the owner and staff for taking such good care of my mom and her family during her illness."}
{"text":"Square is a fantastic place to grab an amazing breakfast! The wait stuff is always friendly, and the food is always delicious!  The wait times can be a bit long, but it's well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Square Cafe is the only place to get brunch up in Regent Square.  There was pretty good sized crowd the last time I went and there was a line around noon so it definitely does get packed.  I had their chicken and apple sausage omelet, which came with a side of home fries and toast (I chose rye).  My companion ordered their chicken and wild mushroom crepes and a side of fries (out of gluttony).  My omelet was alright; it was pretty standard and I've had better omelets before.  I typically like my home fries to be diced into larger pieces with a bit more of a char; they had a nice sprinkling of tasty seasoned salt though.  Also, I would've liked my bread toasted.  On the other hand, my companion's chicken and wild mushroom crepes were absolutely delicious.  The gooey creamy Gruyere cheese sauce brought the entire dish together.  It was topped with some diced tomatoes to add an acidic bite to the dish; I personally found this to be a questionable decision by the chef since the tomatoes contrasted so much from the rest of the dish and didn't really fit in altogether.  Her fries were fried crispy and well seasoned; I couldn't stop stealing them from her plate.  Overall Square Cafe is a nice brunch spot and I might go back once in a while, but I don't think it would be a permanent fixture in my brunch rotation."}
{"text":"Usually get the food delivered via Uber eats. The food always arrives piping hot. The flavors are truly exceptional they are a little more than other breakfast spots, the price is worth the quality of the food you get."}
{"text":"This is a very cute place off of South Braddock, close to the Green Mango. The breakfasts are flavorful, and not too greasy. I have had the breakfast burrito and the veggie omelet, both of which were quite good. My friends got the pancakes, and thought they were delicious. The house coffee is very good, and there are also specialty/gourmet coffees (latte's, etc.), but I have never tried them. This place has an artistic flair, is clean, good service, and also has several tables on the sidewalk that are in the shade during the mornings - nice and cool in the summer. Also, if you are a vegetarian/vegan, this is a very good spot (and one of the few) to go in Pittsburgh, especially for breakfast."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast again this past weekend - again on a Sunday morning with the same friend whom I went with in August.  We arrived at 9:15 and the place was already packed but thankfully we only waited a few minutes before we were seated, and luckily no one needed to wait outside for a table in the below freezing temps.  The menu had some different offerings than the last time I was there so it was a nice chance to try something different.  I ordered the Brussels Sprouts Grits which were Saut√©ed Brussels sprouts, bacon, braised leeks and mushrooms served over cheesy grits with 1 egg over easy.  I also was craving something sweet so I ordered a piece of French toast on the side.  My friend ordered a breakfast sandwich with Amish cheddar and bacon.  I also ordered an almond milk latte.  Overall I enjoyed my trip to Square Cafe more than I did a few months ago.  Maybe they were having a \"off\" morning that morning.  The food was tasty and delivered quickly with friendly service.  I will definitely be returning again for breakfast."}
{"text":"We came here as party of 5 (4 adults + 1 toddler) on a Sunday morning around 8:30 am.  The place is already hopping.  Luckily there was no line yet and we were seated right away.  The place is bright-colored with limited seating outside.  The seating are also tight fit inside, but it's typical for downtown restaurant. I love all the flavor lattes they have and many unique brunch items on the menu.  Between the 4 of us, we ordered smoked salmon omelet, lemon ricotta pancakes, Brussels sprout hash, and chicken mushroom crepes.  I was IMPRESSED on how fast the food came out AND they were all very good!  We also tried the Banaoffee (banana flavor latte) and churro latte - both were yummy but on the sweet side.  I wish I live closer so I can try more things on their menu! On a side note - there are 2 unisex bathrooms - both with changing table AND a little bench for the kiddos to use to wash hands (or sit on the potty).  Very kid-friendly.  Love it.  :)"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant! I got the Brussel sprout hash and it's to die for. Its unlike any other restaurant I've been to. The staff were super friendly."}
{"text":"Having been to Square a few times now (4 I believe), I think it's safe to say this has quickly become one of my go-to's for breakfast in the Burgh. With a fun, quirky atmosphere, friendly waitstaff, and straight-forward fixings, you really can't go wrong starting your morning off at Square.  ATMOSPHERE - 4/5 Polka dots, festive hues of red; green; blue; and orange, abstract flower art hanging on the walls, and funky/retro diner seating. In a word, Fun. Square is about sharing laughs and good times over a scrumptious meal, nothing of the decor of the place would lead one to think otherwise.  DRINKS - 5/5 With a beverage menu nearly as big as their actual food menu, you may need to ask for another minute when your waiter/waitress comes to take your drink order. My 2 cents, you can't go wrong with anything from their specialty latte menu? I've tried nearly everyone and enjoyed all so far. (Pro tip: if you want it to come in the special Square cup, you'll have to order a 12 oz)  FOOD - 4/5 Serving up modern twists on classic diner breakfast dishes, Square's locally sourced, beautifully garnished plates do not disappoint any hungry patron. I recommend their Pumpkin walnut pancakes or Monte Cristo if you're feeling a sweet tooth, otherwise their breakfast sandwich or one of their hashes will do you good. I'll be avoiding their breakfast burrito as my last one was, well, bland, and there are plenty of better sounding options to try next!   Bonus points for their unique idea of giving warm, fuzzy, blue blankets to patrons who sit outside on chilly mornings, was a nice little touch that I won't soon forget."}
{"text":"In terms of breakfast, this is one of our favorite spots.  Among my favorite dishes are the smoked salmon scramble, crab cakes benedict, and the brussel sprouts hash.  The coffee they serve here is also very good and the mugs they use are very unique and add to the experience."}
{"text":"I don't like to give out 5 stars being that it's the mecca of ratings and all, but this place nailed it.  It has it all, great food, great service, and great atmosphere.    I was torn between the Salmon Tartini (I think that's what it was called) and the choriza enchillada.  I'm pretty sure neither would be a miss, but I heard through the grapevine that their chef makes the chorizo.  Thus, I was directed that way.  It was a great tasting dish, perfect for my Sunday hangover.  I also had a peanut butter and banana protein shake which I sucked down like the Hoover Dam!  It was delicious.  If you like a little live entertainment, I'd suggest hanging out at the bar and observing the very friendly, outgoing staff (all good looking women as well, always a plus!).  Before I blew that hot dog stand, I grabbed a coffee to go.  I don't know what it was, but it was the perfect blend of smooth and bold.  I can't wait until next time to try out that Salmon!"}
{"text":"This a great spot for brunch. That being said, prepare to wait, and not just on a weekend - the weekdays are busy as well. I enjoy how they change the menu with what is seasonal, although I'm always sad when I fall in love with a dish and then it's gone... ;). The reason I went with 4 stars is because as one of my dining partners today said, \"Square Cafe is really amazing 1 out of every 4 times,\" and, honestly, I would agree with her. Sometimes the dinning experience is straight up Mary Poppins (practically perfect in every way), and sometimes it's just good. Though square Cafe's \"just good\" is already way above the curve in comparison to other spots in town, even when it's not at it's best. You should go; it's definitely worth a stop - even though I regret adding to the lines... :)"}
{"text":"Square Cafe is a wonderful breakfast place.  The staff is always friendly and quick.  The food is everything from crepes to traditional breakfast food.  There are always a number of groups hanging out and talking over breakfast - everyone is friendly.  The food, coffee and teas are all good.  I wish I got out to Regent Square more often to enjoy Square Cafe."}
{"text":"Square Cafe is like the bougie cousin of Eat'n'Park. Similar to the Pittsburgh chain, Square Cafe is always popping and has a substantial breakfast and lunch menu with local and fresh ingredients that is great for carnivores, vegetarians, and vegans. Despite all of that, Square Cafe is pretty standard family friendly restaurant. I wasn't really blown away by anything on the menu, but I did enjoy the outdoor seating and diner-esque decor of the restaurant. After finishing my meal here, I figured that I would be happy to come back if I was in the Regent Square/Wilkinsburg area, but I wouldn't make this restaurant a destination."}
{"text":"Food was great and service was poor. Had to ask for utensils. Very expensive for lunch, two salads and two coffees = $35.00.  Very crowded seating. Had people squeezing by us to get out."}
{"text":"I eat a work lunch here about once or twice a month and love it. The menu has a ton of fresh choices. I highly recommend the creamy chicken crepes (don't recall the actual name) and one of their exotic iced lattes. We've never had issues with the wait, and the atmosphere is a little crowded, but still friendly and open."}
{"text":"First things first, service was great. If you are here on a weekend or on a holiday, expect at least 15-20 minutes of wait time. Food they offer is totally worth the wait time. I was here with my friend for brunch on memorial day. We had to wait for 20 minutes to get seated. Their menu includes variety of breakfast and lunch items, so we killed the 20 minutes to decide on our order.  We ordered the Brussels sprout hash and the day's special french toast. I was intrigued by the variety of latte flavors they offer and went for the coconut flavored coffee (Smoconut if I remember the name correctly). The coffee is so refreshing and wonderful start to my day. My friend who does not like coffee stole a few sips from my cup! Do try their coffee in the special mugs they have!   The hash is packed with natural vegetable flavors of Brussels sprout, mushroom and caramelized onion served on a bed of creamy grits. I did not even think of seasoning with salt and pepper. You cant stop eating with that rich flowing egg yolk. The grits are creamy, soft and cooked to perfection. French toast is good, regular taste that you get at any good breakfast place.   We will definitely visit again, but next time, we will order the unique items they offer like the hash which I don't get at other brunch places."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, location. You won't be disappointed. I had an egg white scramble with tomatoes and asparagus topped with a crumbled cheese of some sort (forgot the name) served with a side of fresh fruit and an amazing vanilla latte. Everything on the menu sounded so delicious I had a hard time choosing just one! Would 100% recommend and will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This is my new breakfast place! The food is amazing and my friends and I are determined to try the whole menu! Love the atmosphere and service. There is a wait, but it tends to be quick. The coffee is so good too!"}
