{"text":"Bon petit Resto Thaï, apportée votre vin, le rapport qualité/ prix est très bien. La nourriture est de qualité et pourrait être plus relevé.  Le service est généralement courtois."}
{"text":"Been there 4-5 times always 4 star.  This time food still good but service was really poor.  Only 3 tables occupied on a Tuesday night,  but staff all (3) seemed deep in conversation at the service bar.
When very busy on a Saturday th service has always been quick and attentive.  Maybe an off night.
My companions were very turned off by lax service.
Recomend the yellow coconut curry.  Not the wonton - deep fried n a little greasy."}
{"text":"I find this place to offer the best Vietnamese food in Montreal of its kind. The menu offers a wide variety of choices, and at quite reasonable prices. We find it offers the best value to its clients that one could find in it's class. I believe it deserves a 4+ rating. The decor is quite plain but clean and quite spacious. I recommend you try this hidden little gem."}
