{"text":"This place is great if you want to try a variety of Peruvian food. My suggestion is to try the buffet and sample a little of everything and go back for what you like the best. thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic Peruvian meals that transported me back to my time in Peru. Very friendly warm staff who speak Spanish or English and help me with my terrible Spanish.   The lunch buffet is fresh and warm. I'll be back many more times."}
{"text":"Seriously...The very first time i got disappointed such badly. .  The buffet is dry and no flavour. .. The lady server maybe the owner  was so helpful. .. too pricey for such a quality. .. I gave the one star for just the interior"}
{"text":"Very nice lunch buffet. Very traditional Peruvian foods. Consuela is very nice. If first time, let them know and she will explain the sauces to you. Out with a drink for $22 CAD."}
{"text":"Absolute gem!!!! It is a shame that it is difficult to find, but so worth!!!  First, the owners are simply amazing.  Friendly, approachable, they make you feel like family.    The food.  Top notch.  Traveling for a living, getting away from the processed, fried foods is a must.  Tastes of home, and love in each serving.    There is so much on the buffet, i hated not having enough stomach to sample it all.   I will most certainly be back, again and again!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant serves what seems like Peruvian home cooking. This feeling is augmented by the combination of the Nazca geoglyphs painted on the walls, and the ironing board hanging near the cash (no kidding). While the food is prepared okay, I can't give home cooking more than three stars.  Very meat and potatoes. The chicken is pretty flavorful, as are the beans.  If you're looking to go to Humpty's, but want sauces with a unique spice profile, this is an option."}
{"text":"This restaurant, run by a married couple with culinary training, is definitely unique and worth a visit!  We came here because of a coupon, and we'll be back.  Try the chicha morada - a home-made drink made from purple corn which may look strange but is absolutely delicious.  Also great is the rotisserie chicken, lomo saltado and escabeche de pollo.  The bread pudding (with pisco-soaked raisins) and rice pudding/purple corn pudding are both very memorable.    I'll be back and I'll be telling everyone I know about this little gem in NE Calgary!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch buffet and had the purple corn drink. It was very good everyone said they would return. The decor was simple but the food and flavours were great."}
{"text":"I was so happy to learn that Calgary finally has a Peruvian restaurant again that I couldn't wait to try it out!  I lived in Lima for 3 months after university and became addicted to the \"comida criolla\" that Peru is so famous for.  It was definitely as memorable as Macchu Picchu, I kid you not.  I came here tonight with my two sons, a tween and a teen, and you know that this is a tough demographic when it comes to trying new foods.  It helps to wait until they're really hungry, but nevertheless, they were very impressed and loved the food.  We ordered the Lomo Saltado and their specialty rotisserie half chicken.  The chicken was fall off the bone tender and tasty and the Lomo Saltado had the authentic flavor, although a little salty and the fries were a little different from typical, but it did the job. You have a choice between two dipping sauces for the chicken, you must try the spicy Inti one...it was great.  It came with a green salad and the creamy lime dressing was very nice. I was recently in New York and ate at Pio Pio Peruvian restaurant there, and Inti's Lomo Saltado was definitely comparable if not for that added saltiness.  The decor is simple but clean, and the menu is on the smaller side (2 sides of a laminated page) but there is enough variety to keep you interested. We were stuffed, but will definitely be back to try the other dishes and maybe with a bigger group so we can have a greater variety."}
{"text":"This is a lovely little family business. I don't know what to mention first, the great service and friendliness or the amazing food. Either way you can't go wrong stopping into this little place."}
{"text":"Here for the buffet, lots of variety for me with soup, salad, stew, and meat! It taste like home cooking with lots of very neat flavors. Dessert pudding and cakes are the perfect size so that you could try multiple, and they are all delicious! The place looks a little shady from the outside but don't pass it up, you won't regret trying it!"}
{"text":"Once again, Hubby and I ventured out into the Calgary food scene. This time we wanted something different. We came across Inti on Yelp, while searching for a seafood restaurant.  Based on the stellar reviews, and a strong desire to sample another country's food, we made reservations (which by the way you will need, because it is a very small but very popular place) for dinner the next evening.  We were greeted like close family by Consuello. She is a very sweet, kind and warm soul. She insists on making her customers feel like guests in her own home.  We decided to order a typical Peruvian beverage. Consuello suggested a blue corn drink (can't remember the name). It was not sweet but very refreshing and you don't feel like you are drinking suggary soda or mashed up corn.  Consuello suggested that since we wished to sample a variety of Peruvian dishes, that we order the buffet. A great decision! There were lots of different dishes (for carnivores and herbivores) lots of interesting and tasty sauces to sample, salad bar, desert table and two flavoured rice dishes.  We enjoyed the food.They use typical Peruvian spices in their dishes. I ate a flan de leche which was great! It actually tasted homemade, not Betty Crocker! My husband ate his dessert before his food, naturally, which he loved.  The business is family run, all staff are very friendly and helpful.  This restaurant is a little known gem! Help spread the word to other foodies. Inti is awesome!"}
{"text":"Being that I've never had Peruvian food before it's difficult to judge how authentic it was, but I don't really care because it tasted so delicious. And, for what it's worth, I overheard a woman at a nearby table commenting on how much it reminded her of her time living in Peru.  Everyone in my party had the buffet, because the promise of an AYCE adventure is what lured us there in the first place. Buffets can be pretty hit-or-miss and this one is a hit. There was six or eight hot dishes, mostly stew-type stuff. There was a couple beef dishes, a couple chicken including pieces of roast chicken, and something called \"Pork & Nuts\" that tasted a lot better than it sounds. There was also a few kinds of rice, a modest salad bar, and an assortment of different sauces (go for the Inti sauce). The food reminded me of Indian in texture and style, but the taste was South American, which is a rad combination as it turns out.  There was also a dessert bar with date cake, tapioca cake, some sort of fruit sauce, and rice pudding. All good. There was nothing there I didn't like, which is pretty impressive for a buffet.  The service was great too, very friendly and welcoming. 10/10, will eat again."}
{"text":"Good food but quite pricy for the quantity offered. We asked beef hearts for appetizer and it was a really small portion for $10. The chicken with cassava was good, but is a small chicken and 6-7 cassavas. Even my wife was hungry when she left the restaurant. It was my wife's idea to go to this restaurant and she definitely does not want to go back there."}
{"text":"Loved the roasted vegetables and chicken.  The red snapper was decent.  Lovely salsas.  Friendly staff.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We had the lomo saltado which had a wonderful rich flavor -- the tomatoes and onions especially knocked our socks off.  Wish there was a little more of it on the huge portion of fries though.  I also tricked my husband into eating the beef heart skewers, and he gobbled it up and declared it very good until I told him what he had eaten.  He feels ambivalent about them now.  We also shared the purple corn/fruit pudding with rice pudding and it was awesome!  My husband also enjoyed a can of Inca Cola."}
{"text":"Small little place by the hotel i usually stay for business conferences . Really liked it! Awesome buffet with cold and hot peruvian dishes including ceviche."}
{"text":"Our supper club decided to try this little place in the north east. What a gem!   So here is what the man and I had (*Piglet alert*) at Inti:   1) Anticucho: Robustly flavoured beef heart skewers marinated in a spicy sauce with this salsa type sauce and a house mayo with kick. Really good. I loved the  flavour of the beef. 2) Salchipapa: Fresh hand cut French fries with fried sausage. Served on a bed of thin sliced cabbage drizzled in lime juice. This was okay. Basically fries but really really good ones with neat sauces. If you are getting more than one appie to share get a half order of this...a full order is huge. But we ate it all anyway. 3) Aji de Gallina: A traditional Peruvian dish made from pulled Hen in a creamy sauce made from pecans, aji amarillo, and milk. Served over potatoes with rice. This was REALLY good. Unique flavours. Looked like curry but didn't taste like it. I'd go back just for this.  4) Man had: Lomo Saltado Stir-fried tender marinated beef with sweet onions, ripe tomatoes, and julienne aji amarillo in a tangy sauce. Served over fried potatoes and steamed garlic rice. Also really tasty. He ate every last bite  Peruvian food is quite good and very different than anything else I've had before. Usually when I try something new it \"reminds me\" of something I've had elsewhere but this wasn't the case with Inti. All the flavours were new to me which was really a treat.  The service here was also fantastic. They did a great job of making suggestions and helping us pronounce different things without making us feel stupid for not being able to :). Decor is simple but comfortable. It was nice for the group of 8 of us to be able to all talk and hear one another...not always the case when we go out.  Would love to see them add some daily  or seasonal specials as the chef is obviously quite talented and it would be neat to sample some other  Peruvian meals!"}
{"text":"Great service, great place, great food. I had the lunch buffet and they had great options quite a few vegetarian too. The food isn't too spicy, they have sauces and dips separate to add to your meal instead, which I found is very useful for somebody who cannot handle very spicy food."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic and the family that owns it is just as amazing. I love family owned and operated businesses! The food is delicious and the place is nicely decorated and clean. If you want to have a memorable meal.. This is your place"}
{"text":"Quaint and humble atmosphere. The food at this place is absolutely amazing. Imagine being welcomed into a warm, loving Peruvian home - mom and dad in the kitchen serving up quality AND quantity with great enthusiasm.  Go for the buffet!  This is what I had, and how I would grade it:  Flame roasted, char-broiled rotisserie chicken 10/10 (make sure to try all the sauces)  Pulled chicken 10/10  Garlic rice and beef/cilantro rice, both 10/10  Lentils 10/10  Beef/chicken stew 10/10  Chicken quinoa soup 10/10  Fresh salad bar, quality fresh veggies with HOMEMADE dressings. Try them all 10/10  Rice pudding 10/10  Fruit pudding 10/10  To drink I had the Chicha Morada another 10/10.   You pay for quality; lunch buffet + drink + tip came out to just about 24$. Which I think is a fair price for this type of culinary care and attention to customers.   Inti truly deserves all 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Wonderful cozy and traditional.  Excellent food.  Peruvian music.  Quiet and great for a date.  Our host was very polite.  We even practiced some Spanish.  I like the frijoles, the yucca, the porc stew, the candied custard, the fruit drink, etc etc.  They are licensed too.  It is a small place and hidden at the back of a strip mall.  You must go once!"}
{"text":"Came here today for dinner buffet. Place was very clean. Waitress was very friendly. Customer service was awesome.  Food was pretty good. Although the chicken was a little dry, it was still very tasty. The pork in peanut stew was my fav."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Seattle, WA, USA for the weekend, and (hungry at 7pm on a Sunday) decided to try this place out. We walked in 15 minutes before closing, apologetic and expecting to be turned away....instead, we were welcomed with open arms! The waitress/hostess was a total sweetheart. When she found out we'd never eaten Peruvian food before, she made recommendations and took us through every item and what it was, and what it most closely resembles in terms of non-Peruvian fare (it was dinner buffet time). I'm a huge fan of ethnic food and trying new things, so I tried a bit of everything, from appetizer/side to dessert.  What I loved most was the carapulcra (a dish of pork and peanuts that was reminiscent of adobo or mole), although the lomo saltado was also good. My fiance loved the seafood ceviche (which was less citrusy than I'm used to, but for him that was a plus) and rotisserie chicken. We tried all the sauces (the yuca frita is an excellent vehicle for this, as it's basically baked/fried squash) and loved the brasa (spicy), ocopa and inti.   Their desserts were nice, especially the unique Purple Corn Pudding (which tasted like the innards of an apple pie, sans spices, and reminded us both of a Renaissance-era dish). He really liked the coconut rice pudding as well! We split an Inca Kola (something like a bubblegum cream soda) and their non-alcoholic specialty, Chicha Morada (which is purple, fruity, and not too sweet).  There was also a beef stew with parsley and cilantro that was good, but I can't recall the name. Anyway, the point is: it was delicious, and the staff was welcoming and friendly and treated us like friends. It's absolutely worth the money! We didn't find the decor distracting at all- they have fun info snippets about Peru, and it was cheerful. The strip mall it's located in feels a bit run down, and this place was a slice of happy in the midst of sad. I definitely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"I have been to South America several times and the flavors that Inti Peruvian Cuisine delivers is as good as being in country!  One of my Peruvian staff members was with us and vouched for the authenticity as well.    Service was great and friendly, easy 5 by 5.  Food was a solid 5 by 5.   We ordered the lunch buffet and an a la carte order of the seafood ceviché...  so good!      I will be back with more."}
{"text":"Our first meal in Calgary!  My group decided to rent an R.V. to tour the National Parks and while waiting for our vehicle from Cruise Canada, we walked next door and decided to try Inti for lunch.  It was awesome!  My party of four was quickly seated and although we were one of the first tables in that day, the buffet was fresh and hot.  We saw several things being replenished during our meal.  Service was super friendly and welcoming.  Inti proved to be the perfect start to our Canadian R.V. adventure and I am looking forward to coming back this summer and heading straight to Inti from YYC."}
{"text":"I love Inti and have been here countless times and have brought so many people to come experience what I had in Peru. They have also come on their own and even brought their friends as well.   The service is always amazing and I would say there are very few restaurants that resemble what you have traveling abroad let alone be the exact replica of what you had.   This place will not disappoint and I'm always excited to go!  Sidebar... Even when I was in Peru, the papas a la huancaina was served cold and exactly like Inti serves it. (To the user who commented on the papas)."}
{"text":"Having been to Peru, we were interested in trying the dishes we had in Peru to see how they compare.  Instead of the buffet, we ordered the ceviche, lomo saltada, and chicharrón off the menu. We were pleasantly surprised! The fish ceviche was as good as the best ceviche we had in Peru! The lomo saltada was very tasty...almost the same as the equivalent in Peru, except there was a bit more cumin in Inti's version. I love cumin, so I enjoyed it as much as the ones we had in Peru. As for the chicharrón, for me, this was my least favourite dish of the 3 in Peru as I find it dry for my taste, but the taste and texture of this dish was also the same as in Peru, so if you like fried pork belly, give it a try. I loved the beverage, chicha morada, in  Peru and left expecting never to see this again, but to my surprise, Inti had it on their menu! This is a refreshing beverage made of purple corn and with a strong taste of cinnamon... Once again, Inti made it perfectly! So I don't know about the buffet, but if you want a true Peruvian foodie experience, I highly recommend everything we had!"}
{"text":"Great food, welcoming staff, wide selection and friendly environment. We really enjoyed this restaurant and found them very accommodating and adaptable to our large (without reservation) group."}
{"text":"I'm giving Inti a two star, I would have given it a three star if it wasn't for the poor customer service we received. I went to this place over the weekend with a friend as we were celebrating and I wanted her to experience some south american food. What a let down. And let me tell you why:  Our adventure started fine, the waitress was pleasant and brought us the corn crunchies to snack on, we ordered the white wine, she did tell us it was fruity but when we tried it, it tasted more like apple juice with a hint of alcohol. Too fruity for my liking, but I let it pass since I know that in these places you can not expect good wines. For starters we ordered the yuca with chicharron, both items are deep fried so you cannot screw this up. I order the lomo salteado and my friend the papas a la huancaina.   The lomo was OK, I have had much better in my own kitchen. My friend did not like the papas as they were cold, with a yellow sauce drowning the two boiled potatoes cut in half and when you tasted it, the only thing in your mouth was the  overpowering garlic aftertaste. If I recall correctly, these potatoes also come with boiled eggs and olives, but were M.I.A. The manager came over, told us she was not going to take this item out of the bill because there was nothing wrong with the dish, the potatoes where cooked to perfection (boiled!) and that this was one of their most popular dishes (seriously??!!). Even when I've gone to Earls and did not like something, they take care of it, but not at Inti, bottom line, if you don't like it TOO BAD!!   Would I recommend this place to anyone? Absolutely not!! Safe your money and go to Denny's instead!!   Inti, if you are ever in New York, do yourself a favor and drop by Pio Pio, now THAT's Peruvian food with great wine and great customer service!!"}
{"text":"Strange location but fantastic food.  Make sure to reserve for weekend dinner."}
{"text":"I went for dinner buffet and really liked it. Variety of flavors and sauces up to hot. I will be going back for sure. Staff are very friendly. Win!"}
{"text":"I stumbled in late, like always, to another CMYE event held by Wendy. I was glad to see that it replaced the old Filipino restaurant I tried years ago because that place wasn't very good.  I'm not sure if this place is new and is still undergoing renovations but as Terrence said in his review, it's quite minimal in its decor. It kinda bothered me in the sense that I felt like I was meeting everyone in the cafeteria of SAIT but soon slipped my mind the moment I started talking to everyone.  I was worried about the portions of food and quality since my bottled water, which costed two dollars, came in a travel size. $2 for 2 cups of water? Eh?  But before I could snark, smug, sour, and stew about the whole water fiasco, my order came; the PAN CON CHICHARON. Brother/Sister, any dish that has a sing-songy enunciation is a bonafied tastebud treasure. Seriously, the way this review read it was heading towards a mediocre three but Inti redeems itself!  The Peruvian answer to the pork belly sandwhich was no joke: crispy fried pork served in a bun. Oh wait, there were also other precious tasties inside: an avocado mayo, special salsa, cabbage, and a fried yam. Wow this was worth the drive across the city, skipping training, and lying to myfitnesspal.com daily stats, The subtle richness of all the ingredients complimented the salty Chicharon. The crispiness of the bread and meat existed but didn't make the experience of eating the whole thing obnoxious. The taste? Forget it, it's midnight and I have to work tommorow, NOT ENOUGH TIME.  Served with a choice side, I ended up with the yuca frita, which were fried casava chunks lightly salted.   Inti, ditch the bland dining room, the $2 bottled water and get yourself a cozy little truck and roll over everyone else in the city with your PAN CON CHICHARON."}
{"text":"First time ever trying Peruvian food. And I just love it. I ordered quarter chicken with yucca fries and salad. I loved the dressing - it was a creamy lime that tasted a bit like cucumber dressing. Big salad too. The chicken was tender and I liked the two sauces that accompanied it. I LOVED the spicy chicken sandwich - wow - it was a big hot delicious mess to eat. Next time, I'll order the beef with vegetables and regular fries. It just smelled amazing - I could smell the peppers in it. Fantastic prices, great service, and really delicious food."}
{"text":"The buffet sits out all day, and then goes in a fridge at night and comes back out for the rest of the day.  The meat is so dry and overcooked its plain to see.  All the items are kept at respectable temperatures though so I dont think there is a problem with food saftey.  I tried the chicken and casava, it was bland and bland.  For the prices they really are relying on every customer.  The prices are so high that they only need one or two customers to pay the bills.   had the pork belly sandwitch, and I asked for it done very well, crispy!   The waitress said yes it comes crispy, very well done!!  IT came and it was very fat-filled, barley crispied.  Hardly crispy at all.  The fat did not render away from the belly.  So i spent most of the time picking fat off the belly or spitting it out.  I was hungry so I ate it, knowing full well later that my ass would bleed from improperly cooked food, and I did have stomach pains all night.  I left no tip and I will never be back.   *reviews are the express opinion of reviewer and do not represent the views of Yelp or its subsidiaries."}
{"text":"Visiting from Arkansas for the week, randomly stumbled upon this place for lunch. The hostess was completely hospitable, it was our first time there so she walked us through all the dishes on the buffet as well as the drink menu explaining everything, which was very helpful. We all tried some of everything on the buffet and every thing we tried was DELICIOUS. I can't express how seriously well made and fresh all the food was. When you go to a buffet the last thing you expect is fresh made food with ingredients you can feel good about but Inti literally has the best buffet I have ever tried. Not to mention they are almost completely gluten free which is pretty great now a days.  We plan on going back as many times as we can while we're still in town.   Hands down you absolutely must try this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing find. You must come here to try their food. As everyone says try the buffet. Here were my favourites: seco de carne (beef stew), lentejas guisasas, rostisserie chicken and the pork and peanut stew (they said it was spice but it wasn't too bad-I'm not a spice person), ceviche. The desserts were amazing so save room and the mojitos were top notch!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend trying this family owned Peruvian resonant. It has some great vibrant director. I have gone on multiple occasion once for a Vine and Dine and the other times with coworkers.  The people running this place are have the  loveliest people I have ever come across in a restaurant.   I recommend going for the lunch buffet that way you get to try a little of everything. So when you go back for dinner you know what you like.  My favorite item is the cheese potato salad it has a little kick to it!  This was very surprising to me because I typically hate potato salad but you need to try it.   Great spot to switch it up your lunch, if you work close by you need to check it out!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I should definitely check it out again now that they have renovated.   I used to go here almost every Friday for an early dinner. It was always impossible to resist the buffet. You get a nice sample of Peruvian cuisine (or at least a certain part of Peru). They have wonderful sauces that do magic to the dishes. The star of the buffet is \"pollo a la brasa\". It's definitely one of my top 5 chicken dishes in the whole world. It's marinated whole chicken perfectly roasted and then cut up into pieces. It's flavorful and moist.  The staff is friendly and I'm looking forward to my next meal there!"}
{"text":"Buffet dinner offered a nice sampling of Peruvian dishes.  Our favorite was the salted lomo, which had a full and interesting flavor.  The lentils were also excellent.  Other highlights included the yucca, subtle and complex flavored Rotisserie chicken and the desert selections.  Service could not have been more friendly."}
{"text":"Please be aware of the prices, they are rather steep for the food and overall experience. The server was not the most polite, and the menu options are few. Overall, I would rate this restaurant as OK. Could be much better. Food was tasty though."}
{"text":"What a great family run place.  We came in tonight and they could not have been nicer.  The lady (who i think owned the place) just wanted us to be happy with our selection.  We got 3 buffets and one dinner order.  The dinner order was enough to feed 2 people.  The buffet was unlimited so the kids kept going back for more. Very good food and the atmosphere was very nice. With a little music playing in the background.   Id say a tiny pricy but if you want authentic pruvian food, this is a great stop."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service! Will definitely be coming back. The atmosphere was nice and the decor is interesting. Everything feels very authentic. Favourite dishes in the dinner buffet were the chicken and quinoa soup, the baked yuka, a very nice bean sauce for the insanely flavourful steamed veggie mix. Also a creamy sweet lime sauce to pour over everything! The dessert was a coconut rice pudding and the best in house made fluffy cupcakes with a cream cheese icing. I was happy with every bit of this experience. The owner is super sweet and friendly. Best buffet I've ever had!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new one Monday evening, or OK truth be known I didn't feel like cooking, so we stopped into Inti. Inti, if you didn't know, is named after the Incan Sun God. Lucky for us they just so happen to be serving up a buffet.  Excitedly we armed ourselves with a plate and marched to the buffet like good little soldiers preparing for battle. As we ogled all the items, the lovely Consuela, who was refilling the food stations, took the time to explain all the food choices to us. She even brought out some non spicy chicken wings just for the kids. We filled our plates, and rushed back to the table to get started. The prelude to the meal was a Pisco Sour and a Piscojito which hubs and I shared. Both were tasty delights, but the winner for me was the Piscojito, a spin on a Mojito.   The food was so diverse and flavourful it's hard to pick favourites but the standouts for me were the Lomo Saltado, Papa a la Huancaina, Consomme de Pollo, Carapulcra, Yuca Frita and the Pollo a la Brasa. And the sauces, heaven help me. I tried and loved every sauce/dip they had with the exception of ranch and the extra extra hot sauce (didn't try those two).  Executive Chef and owner Hans Puccinelli developed the recipes in the restaurant and was currently working the front of the house when we arrived for our meal. Friendly, helpful and very interesting to talk to, we enjoyed chatting with him as much as we enjoyed eating the food.   This was a great family food experience. Our kids loved it so much they wanted to come back the next day!"}
{"text":"I'm so inti... er.. into the food at Inti! It's tucked away in strip mall ville in the NE on 26th St and just off 32nd Ave. The permit on the door says the maximum occupancy is 56. Yep, nice and cozy.  I've never been to Peru, and digging through my food memories, I'm pretty sure this was my first time trying it. As far as authenticity goes, I really have no comparison. But my flavah feelers know what they like, and they liked what they tasted here.   I started with a Pisco Sour (you've heard of a liquid lunch, right? Well, skip the appies because cocktails are the NEW starter... I kid, don't skip the appies. Have your cocktails and appies too!). Peruvian pisco, syrup, egg whites, lime and ice. It comes in a wee little glass for $7.50, but it's a refreshing sipper of a drink and I'm a fan of the light, frothiness that beaten egg whites lend to the texture of a drink.  For my main, I ordered Frijoles Con Seco De Carne - stewed frijoles canarios with braised cilantro beef and steamed garlic rice served with salsa criolla. Price tag: $14.90. It was a plate full of meat, beans and salad and just a neat little cup of rice in the middle. Not trying to up the ante of the dish with more rice than the rest of the food? Inti, you know the way to a Yelper's heart. The beef was nice and tender, no knife needed.   I only wish I would've had room for dessert!"}
{"text":"When we arrived for a table of 5 at 6:45pm ( They close at 8pm) They were so kind to us right from the get go.   The place isn't big, the decor simple with ancient peruvian pictograms painted on the white walls. The menu is small, and the buffet variety seemed small but certainly it was not lacking as it has the popular items from the menu and was a great way to try different food items of Peru.   The staff were warm and accommodating. When we decided to have the dinner buffet instead of a La carte, the kitchen brought out fresh food to fill the buffet table so that we wouldn't have to eat the \"remaining\" food that had been sitting there as the restaurant seemed to have passed its dinner rush. They were so friendly and so thoughtful, service was excellent! He made me a special ceviche as the ceviche on the buffet may have shrimp (which I have an allergy to).   They make all their sauces in house (all 9 of them!)   If you haven't tried Peruvian food, the buffet is perfect because you can try a little of everything (appetizers, dessert, entree).   $25.90/pp for dinner buffet (I can't remember the cost of the lunch buffet).   Thank you sooooo much to the staff on making our experience a delicious one!   P.s. its in a strange \"U\" shaped strip mall that has a tux shop in one end and a Jamaican restaurant on the other. Inti is located at the very back (bottom of the \"U\")."}
{"text":"Review #9 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012  I've never been to Peru nor have sampled any Peruvian dishes before but I know that when my tummy is happy and my taste buds are satisfied, that's considered good food right? Both criteria were satisfied by Inti.  Service was absolutely great. Servers were friendly, very attentive to the needs of customers and gives good food recommendations. Our food also came right away which was very much appreciated as one of my visits was a really late lunch and my tummy was already growling. Everytime I go to Inti, I get that vibe that the place is very well-kept - decor/color choice that brightens the place and floors and tables always look like they're wiped clean.   Now the best part - the food! I'm trying to stay away from fried food but the crispiness, right amount of saltiness and tang from the sauce of the chicharon con yuca frita is just so hard to resist! If you are in the mood for chicken with lots of herb flavors I highly recommend their rotisserie chicken. If you are in the mood for a light meal of chicken with a little bit of heat then go for the Escabeche de Pollo - the meat's fall off the bone without being overcooked. If you're looking for more heat and a sandwich that's bursting with flavors order the Brasa Sandwich. I have to warn you that it is a little messy (ok it's really messy) to eat but it's so good you wouldn't mind dirtying your hands. When it first came to our table I thought that's a huge sandwich but the first bite was so good, I emptied my plate anyway.  In one of my visits I checked in through Yelp and saw an offer of free dessert so I asked and was told that I can have rice pudding or bread pudding. I never liked pudding so I was ready to leave but realized that I was being offered a free dessert so I said bread pudding. I tried it and my life view on puddings was forever changed. It melts in your mouth and the sauce and whipped cream were just good together. It's so good I will drive across town for it.  It's so good I hope it asks me out so I can marry it, make lots of baby bread puddings and eat my young."}
{"text":"I've never had Peruvian food before but for my first encounter at Inti last night, I have absolutely no complaints about any dish I ate, the service or the atmosphere.  Inti delivers a unique food experience and is a great outing for a large group.  My spouse and I shared a half order of the Salchipapa starter and this was more than enough.  Honestly, it could be a meal for one.  I loved the fries and sausage combo but the mixture of condiments recommended by the server made it excellent.  Who would have thought that mustard, olive mayo and ketchup drizzled over top would be a flavor party in your mouth?  Sooo good.  Be aware that unless you show up at Inti completely starving, an appetizer like this will rob you of much of your appetite because you won't be able to stop eating it.  My main dish was the Aji de Gallina.  Why not go full on traditional while you're here?  When you see the food you expect one flavor but when you eat it, it's something completely different and delicious.  And spicy.  This is a heavy meal because it includes potatoes and rice, but the sauce has wow factor and is worth trying.  My spouse ordered the Chasqui Burger.  Great presentation and the patty looks and tastes home-made.  The burger is massive with the help of a fried egg and angel hair potatoes.  I took a bite and enjoyed it as much as he did.  Olive mayo is on it too, which I knew at this point is amazing.  He ordered the Yuca Frita as a side and he barely had room in his belly for a few bites.  I really like Yuca so will be eating his leftovers.    Inta has the 18% gratuity charge policy for parties of 8 people or more, which applied to our group.  However, the food servings are so large and the prices are so reasonable that for the first time ever, I actually didn't care about this.  I must note that even though our server was amazing, the actual food delivery part was quite slow.  It may have been because of our large group.  They did manage to deliver all of our appetizers together as well as our mains, so no one ate ahead of anyone else.    For those who appreciate dining adventures, I definitely recommend Inti."}
{"text":"This place was hopping when I walked in this past Canada Day.  Being of partial Peruvian heritage, and my folks being in town and having just visited family in Peru, I thought it would be an interesting break from the usual restos.  CBC's John Gilchrist had given the place a phenomenal review, and the buzz was good.  Decor is absolutely minimalist.  There's these Incan designs on the wall, but that's pretty much it.  Stil, it's clean, neat and I wasn't there for the food.  Service was a bit slow to say the least, but at the same time to be fair, there was only one waitress for the entire resto, and I think only 1 cook as well.  Considering it took probably 10-15 min to get a menu after we were seated, and another 10 before our order was taken, it probably wasn't a great day for the server.  Now the food... hmmm...  I've had peruvian in several countries though only my mom and dad have actually have had it home cooked and in the actual country.  It was authentic, but really needed to eventually be expanded.  The Chicken dishes were fine and well, but Peruvian cuisine especially explodes with flavour when seafood is taken into account (presently, there's only a ceveche dish offered under certain times.    Still, the other touches are authentic, from the crunchy corn snacks, to the yucca fries and the bottles and/or cans of Inca Cola.  The chicken was nice, though the rosemary was quite subdued to the point of near invisibility.  The various potato dishes were bang on with a nice touch of heat.  Lime was everywhere when needed.  Pricing is quite reasonable overall, and I did enjoy the meal though as there were particular shortages at the time (we ended up with the last 1/2 chicken of the entire day), and the lack of other seafood dishes were notable.  Still worth trying at least once or more, as some of the other dishes customers had ordered looked actually pretty awesome (my family had opted for family dining dishes as opposed to individual ones).  The only reason why my review is more a 3 to 3.5 is simply because of the limited menu and the shortages at the time.  A bit more depth, and I think they could hit it out of the park."}
{"text":"The buffet variety is a bit small but if you like meats then it won't matter because there's plenty of meat dishes.  The food quality is good, tasty and a good value.  The service is fast and friendly.  I would've given it 4-stars except I think they could do a bit more about the decor and presentation.  With a $16 lunch buffet and $26 dinner buffet price tag I expect a bit of a more upscale ambiance."}
{"text":"The service in this place is just  Excellent!!.. And the food is  incredible Delicious!!... I had the ceviche and the \"lomo salteado\". Both were AWESOME!!...  I was told the ceviche was offered only on thursdays, fridays and saturdays. Additionally, the drinks are  Great  and the prices very reasonable...  I just wish they would have more Peruvian sea food, but unfortunately it is very hard to find fresh sea food in Calgary. I guess that's why they do not offer all the Peruvian dishes we can find in other cities...."}
{"text":"Great Food . Cozy atmosphere . Went for a buffet lunch the chicken and fish were terrific ."}
{"text":"A must try in Calgary.  We've been to peru in the past and this restaurant stays true to its roots. They even serve classic drinks like inca cola and chicha morada. The food is simple but delicious and does remind me of food in Peru. I suggest going for their buffet so you can try a bit of everything. I love yuca fritas and it is always nice to find them in the city. Their desserts are also yummy. The staff/owners are very personable and friendly, when prompted they are always willing to teach us a bit about peruvian culture. Give this place a try if you want a different food experience and to try some peruvian food."}
{"text":"What a great meal!  It's been a while since I could say that.  The appetizer, the main courses and the desserts were all spectacular!   Try the hot sauces.  They're not brutally hot, but actually very tasty, with a little zing to them!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Peruvian food at its best!  What a way to try all types of Peruvian food at the Intl lunch buffet!    We ordered the Chicha Morada - Purple corn drink.  So refreshing.  There was a salad bar with different types of dressings, interesting potato salad and pasta salad.    Where shall I begin with the entrées?  They start with OMG to Fantastic!  There was these lightly breaded red snapper that was so tasty with the various sauces that go with it.  Those seasoned potatoes are so good by themselves but with that Huacaina sauce - hmmm, kick up the spice a notch! Those stewed beans and the pork and potatoes stew was so good on that garlic rice.  There was a spaghetti with beef strips in an interesting Peruvian style and spice.  There was some steamed beans (green and yellow) with baby carrots.  Eat them with some of that delightful sauce.  OMG, how could I forget the most wonderful roasted chicken I've ever tasted.  So tender and doused with the Intl sauce or the spicier version, Brasa sauce, makes my mouth water,   The sauces really wake up your tastebuds with each bite.    There were 2 kinds of desserts.  One was made with the Purple Corn and pineapple pieces and the other, was the Coconut Rice Pudding.  Both were pretty good and not too sweet which was perfect for me.  Very clean and well-maintained restaurant. Kudos to the chef.  The buffet was always supplied with small batches of food so as to keep it fresh at all times.  Kudos to the owners who always came to check on our table to see if we need anything or kept asking us how we liked the food.  We loved it, of course!  We'll be back to eat at Intl.  Gotta try their dinner buffet."}
{"text":"3 for atmosphere 4+ for service 5 for the food!!  As buffet service goes, Inti is great - the food is kept fresh and warm (or cool, where appropriate). Like many commenters here, I don't know \"authentic\" Peruvian - but I know what tastes great. Make sure to try as many sauces as you can. (Why aren't they for sale at the counter?)  My only caveat is that the buffet dinner is a touch pricey at almost $26 - but there's an easy way to justify the cost: come hungry, and eat well.  You'll be glad you did."}
