{"text":"I am WAAAAAAAYYYYY overdue for a visit to Down To The Bone. We found out about it when my wife and I met the owners at a grocery store. I must admit, I can't describe most of the main courses because I can't get past the Pork Ribs. They're so incredibly delicious and melt-off the bone tender that anytime I'm waiting in line to order I look at the meats on the menu, think to myself \"That looks good, ooh so does that, hmm maybe I'll try...\" but as soon as it's my turn to order what flies out of my mouth is inevitably \"Ribs please\". My wife swears by the fried chicken. I have danced my way around the sides though and the Yams have to be tasted to be believed. Beyond great. The mac and cheese is stellar too. This isn't \"light lunch\" fare so take my advice and come hungry and save room for dessert. They have Junior's cheesecake. Now, if you've never set foot in Brooklyn, NY that might not mean anything to you, but if you dig cheesecake give it a go. My wife loves the banana pudding, but my favorite is the Pineapple Upside-Down cake. The service is great, the staff friendly and customers are made to feel welcome. I always feel a lot slower when I leave, but also a hell of a lot happier. It must have been something I ate."}
{"text":"The food was great. Just like mom's cooking. They gave us so much food, we had to get a doggy bag. It was hard to locate."}
{"text":"Clean but divey in a good way...  expect styrofoam and plastic forks.  Cafeteria style ordering.   Friendly straightforward service.  Not everything on the standard menu is available all the time.. when we walked in (6:30ish on a Saturday night) ...we were directed to the handwritten board of what was available now.  Fairly reasonably priced for the amount of food you get.  For four adults it was about $40.   At $10 or so per plate including two heaping sides and a big slice of cornbread or a biscuit, that's pretty good.  It was great to pile it on after drinking pints at The Flying Saucer down the street.     The fried catfish was piping hot, with crunchy flavorful batter on the outside, moist and flaky on the inside.   Not at all greasy.  Collards were naturally sweet and delicious.  Mac n cheese was more buttery than cheesy but still good..  I ate it all with the addition of a little salt.  The fried chicken got good reviews too, and the yams were sweet, with a bit of brown sugar and butter, but not heavy.     All that with great music playing the background and I would go back for sure.  Mmm!"}
{"text":"This place is a huge hangout for cops in the university area. Please don't show up here stoned even though it'd satisy your munchies. :] Ok, enough about the jokes. This little place opened up two years ago in a shopping center. I drove by the \"coming soon\" sign and was hopeful about the place. Well, it lives up to the hype. It really is a great place to catch up on some homemade southern food.  I haven't been in about a year, but I highly recommend the place."}
{"text":"Please support this joint.  The food is great.  I got the BBQ beef ribs and they were classic.  Corn bread was excellent, collard greens great and if you are looking for creamy tasty mac-n-cheese this is the place.  I have tried the fried chicken too and it is fabulous.  The decor is good you will not be disapppointed with the food."}
