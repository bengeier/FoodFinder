{"text":"The staff was fantastic, our waiter was great very polite and with a good sense of humor. The food was excellent along with the suggested wine!"}
{"text":"Montecito was a big disappointment to me.  I was there for a business lunch during the film festival -- the location was convenient, the room was beautiful and it had a little buzz.  On the plus side, it was very comfortable and the service was excellent.  There weren't many in there for lunch at 1pm which I should have taken as a warning.  Our waiter was attentive without being in the way and I was expecting a good meal.  My guest and I both ordered salads and we were both disappointed.  He had the B.C. Prawns and I had the Albacore Tuna Nicoise.  Considering the price of the salads - $22 and $20 respectively - we were both a little surprised at how tiny they were.  He had a small pile of shrimp and a few greens.  I had a lump of what looked like upscale canned tuna, half a boiled egg, four green beans and a little lettuce.  I think the biggest shock was the tuna - I was expecting a piece of fresh tuna and got something that looked like it came from a can.  The salads were okay in taste (except for the tuna itself) and quickly eaten since they were so small.  I also ordered iced tea and got a cloudy amber beverage that tasted like it was made from instant tea powder.  Even the waiter agreed that it was nasty looking.    So - go for the ambience or the convenience or don't order the salads.  Maybe some of the other dishes are better but it felt like a ripoff to me."}
{"text":"Went for a celebration lunch and found this place to be just perfect. Atmosphere was just right, service was on point, good prices for downtown Toronto, and of course, delicious food.  I had had the kale/anchovy/pecorino salad once before and could not stop thinking about it. This time when I ordered it for my main it was too salty but still good.  Also sampled the joe's special, the chicken sandwich, and the bolognese pasta. All a tad salty but otherwise done to perfection.  StayPuft mousse tasted a bit stale but it was interesting to try the sea gooseberry jelly (tart and sour but pleasant). The honey Chomeur cake was satisfying.  The Riesling (the one you can order by the glass) was mind blowing."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Appetizers were delish. Wine was great and the filet/rib was amazing. Server was excellent. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was recently at Montecito for Sunday brunch to celebrate a birthday. Unfortunately,  I found the experience to be quite disappointing. As someone who is gluten intolerant, I found that the staff were not as knowledgeable about foods containing gluten as other restaurants. When I asked the server which items were gluten free, he said he didn't know and that I would have to ask the people at the buffet stations. Ther only person at a station was the person at the  carving station who was serving beef brisket. I had to go to the hostess station to ask someone about gluten free items. One of the ladies (I think she might have been the manager) did walk me through the buffet pointing out obvious items that did not contain gluten (I.e. those containing flour or bread). I then asked about things with soy sauce or other \"hidden\" sources of gluten and she was very unsure about whether or not which dishes were safe to eat. As a result, the only things I felt safe to eat were the beef brisket was assured it was gluten free) and an omelette. Both were very, very salty.  One thing of note... there is no omelette station. The omelettes are ordered through the server and there are only 4 choices of ingredients to add: bacon, catamelized onions, fontina cheese and/or mushrooms.  Given my experience, I would not go back to the Montecito."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding until the end when we waited over 10 minutes for our bill.  The food was all very good, fresh and flavourful, no complaints.  They had roobios tea on the menu which was a rare treat.    We shared the autumn harvest salad.  It was romaine and frisee with some roasted vegetables, very nice.  When our plates were cleared someone cleared the crumbs off our table which I appreciated.  For our mains we had the pasta and the halibut and both were very good.  We shared the chocolate torte for dessert.  It was ok, nothing amazing. The tea was loose leaf and served in a bodum. After our dessert plate was cleared we were ignored for at least 10 minutes.  Finally our server came back and asked if we wanted anything else.  Once we asked for the bill it was handled quickly but it's a shame to ruin what could have been a great experience right at the end."}
{"text":"I was extremely unimpressed with the service at this restaurant. My party and I dine out on the regular and we are real food lovers. From the moment we walked in until we left we felt uncomfortable by the service and surroundings. While the restaurant has a very trendy atmosphere the staff need some major training on good customer service.   After being seated 30 minutes after arriving (and yes we had a reservation), excited to eat we asked our server what he recommends. He quickly answered by suggesting one or two dishes and rushed away without answering any of our questions and leaving us more confused. When we tried ordering drinks he gave us an attitude and took a VERY long time to bring us our order. We must have asked for bread at least 3 different times only to never have him bring the bread.   All in all, the service was complete shit and left us never wanting to go back. As people who dine out a lot and have lived in major cosmopolitan cities around the world I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone I know. Unless they properly train the staff and work on customer service, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I went here for New Year's Eve with my partner, and I have to say the food, service and atmosphere were just amazing. I love the open view of the kitchen, you can see how hard the kitchen staff work at delivering delicious, farm-to-table food. I loved the pork chop with the crab apple jelly! The beef carpaccio was also superb. The DJ they arranged that night also had excellent taste. I'm already looking forward to my next meal there."}
{"text":"As a local I can say that their brunch is a joke and a complete disappointment.  We came here for a birthday and what a let down.  Must be tailored to a tourist because no right minded local would pay $35/person for that sub par continental breakfast. They charge you every time you refill your coffee! For real? They charge yiu for every coffee! Lol  buffet does not include eggs, waffles, pancakes,... If you wanted them they were made to order and would deliver one pancake at a time. They were missing variety, quality, and quantity. Very disappointing for sure and I can say that I will go to the local spots that earned their reputation."}
{"text":"I came to Montecito with a big family group for Mother's day, wanting to treat my Mom and Grandma to a good pizza lunch. I took a look at their sample menu online and saw that Montecito offers pizza at lunch! But silly me, that was the lunch menu and we were actually there during brunch hours, which did not include pizza. It would have been okay but my Grandma is quite picky. I tried to plead with the server but he was pretty unfazed and unsympathetic to my situation. There wasn't anything on the small brunch menu that she particularly wanted so she just picked randomly and picked at her food. I personally couldn't focus on my own food while I worried about my Grandma. The rest of my group seemed to enjoy the food, although it wasn't particularly outstanding.   As their main customers during those hours (the restaurant was pretty empty), I think the restaurant could have made some exceptions to their menu or at least attempted to. When I called to make a reservation beforehand, it was made very explicitly that a service charge would be added to my big group which was fine. But, when I actually paid, the server pointedly exclaimed that tip was not actually included, as if I purposely did not tip. It was awkward. The service ruined my experience and will not be returning again."}
{"text":"Montecito has probably the worst management J have ever experienced in Toronto. A restaurant a this level was a complete disappointment in service and attitude."}
{"text":"Went for birthday brunch buffet. Made reservations before hand.  Had 4 mimosa, coffee, and the brunch.   Amazing service and everything I ate was just outstanding. We walked away rejoicing all the magnificent food, service and ambiance. Loved the inside of this restaurant too. Went for birthday and they even personalized the menu plus put together a special on the house birthday dessert that was to die for.   Not your typical brunch, with the usual stuff. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Have been here regularly for a few months now and have to say the service has always been outstanding! The food's been great, any minor complaints we may have had about the food were always taken care of very promptly. Highly recommend the kale salad, it is one of my favorite items on the menu."}
{"text":"3/5! So I heard raving reviews about this place but I was not very impressed. The JW chicken and halibut were good but overpriced for what you get. There are definitely better options in downtown. Best part about the night is that Bautista was sitting right behind us. This is a great palce to so for star sightings!"}
{"text":"A group of us went to Montecito today for their Summerlicious lunch menu ($28). One of us is a foodie, one of us is very particular about everything and not afraid to ask, and the others (me included) just like to eat.  One of us asked which red wine has soft tannins, and the waitress (sorry, I forget her name) recommended Humberto Canale Patagonia Merlot, which was a soft and velvety treat. Great recommendation.  I ordered the Heirloom Tomato Salad with Buffalo Mozzarella & Garlic Croutons, Grilled Vegetable Sandwich and Cheese Board. I am in no way vegetarian, but if all veg food was this good, I would be. Heirloom salad was delightful, a fantastic mix of flavour and texture, and the presentation was colourful and enticing. The Grilled Vegetable sandwich was fantastic, and it was a struggle not to eat everything on my plate and get too full. So my other half enjoyed the half sandwich I brought home.  For as much as I love cheese, anything beyond your basic mozzarella is pretty exotic to me. The Buffalo mozzarella was delicious, and all three of the cheeses on the cheese board were fantastic.  Service was excellent. The waitress could tell we were office workers and asked if we wanted our mains before we were completely finished our appetizers or would we prefer to wait. Amazingly, were out within about an hour without feeling rushed. Atmosphere inside was great (I especially loved the faux windows with moving images, and that you could see the plating station via ceiling mirrors).  Every bite made me think this might be the place to bring the wife for our 30th anniversary in a couple of months. And she enjoyed the cold half Grilled Vegetable sandwich I brought home, so I think she agrees. We all agreed it was delicious food, great service, and wine so good I took a photo of the wine list just so I could find out if the LCBO sells it (they don't)."}
{"text":"This review is for the Farm to Table brunch.  I've dined at Montecito for dinner in the past (but never reviewed them), and have only recently learned of their Farm to Table Sunday Brunch.  Wow, I'd been missing out for some time!  I've now been twice, and each time was rewarded with an excellent brunch experience.  The offerings were a little different during each visit - on one visit, they had steak with chimichurri and our other visit coincided with Easter, so they had Ham and a Lamb as their meat feature.  During the Easter brunch, they also had a larger raw bar, with shucked oysters which is normally not available during the regular brunch (which still had a seafood bar) with smoked salmon, tuna crudo, etc.  Most important to me is that their famous kale salad was available on both visits, along with chacuterie and cheese boards, fried chicken, and many other goodies.  In addition, they offer made-to-order omelettes (with a choice of fillings) and pancakes (plain or chocolate chip).  And save room for the desserts as their homemade cakes (one time was red velvet, another time was carrot) featured a fantastic buttercream icing.    There was a price difference for the holiday brunch - regular is $39 and for Easter it was $45 per person. Coffee or tea is included, and there's a $5 special for mimosas or ceasars.  I was informed of the premium pricing when they called to confirm the reservation for Easter Sunday, so that's fair.  Unfortunately, I'm not into oysters, so I think I would prefer to go during regular brunch, instead of during a  holiday.    Overall, for the quality of the food you get, and the service, the $39 is well worth it.  I had done some research, and Collette is ~$55 for their Sunday brunch buffet, Toca is ~$80, and most of the other higher end buffets are in the $50-60 range.  Granted photos show a larger buffet, but considering a person can only eat so much, and I'm not hugely into oysters, I'm perfectly content with Montecito's offerings.  There will be more repeat visits in my future."}
{"text":"Just had the most incredible dinner at Montecito. Drove down from Aurora and was blown away by the food and even more by the service. At all times there was staff attending to empty water glasses, napkins that required folding, clearing plates etc. Our waiter was extremely knowledgable about the entire menu and took the time to answer out many questions!! Looking so forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I would have chosen 2.5 stars if given the option. Highlights: ambiance & decor (bar & WCs); and the charcuterie board for sharing.  Otherwise, food and wine is overpriced based on taste and overall quality.  I realize Toronto has a number of overpriced restaurants in the city (I am a local), but do expect  better quality for the price tag. The food here was mediocre at best. Example: I couldn't finish the meatballs ($19) as they were dry & tasteless.  (Maybe I am spoiled from having the meatballs at Little Anthony's).  The halibut was overcooked and a ridiculously small portion.  Though our friends enjoyed the duck breast & pasta.  NB. We dined during Summerlicious (my least fav time to try out any new restaurant in TO).  My boyfriend ordered from the Summerlicious menu which may account for the small portions he received; while the rest of our table ordered from the regular menu.  Finally, the menu is heavy on higher priced wines.  Based on our first experience, it is unlikely we will return for anything other than cocktails at the bar. There are plenty of better restaurants in this city."}
{"text":"Took a long time for someone to greet us but really enjoyed my second visit here.  It was a beautiful night so we sat on the patio. Half price pizzas on Thursday! We also had the Cheese board and my favourite kale salad in the city. Service knowledgeable, friendly and upbeat."}
{"text":"We came to Montecito as a party of six for a birthday, and the food and service were excellent.  We were seated immediately, and (spoiler alert!) given custom menus with a 'Happy Birthday' message on them - great start!  The cocktail menu was comprehensive, leaning toward 'artsy' and away from 'sweet'.  The wine list couldn't be much bigger.  There is a small selection of beer on tap and in bottle.  Everyone at the table had trouble ordering due to the great selection of dishes.  Appetizer winners were the Charcuterie board (amazing foie gras) and the house staple Kale Salad.  Entrees were equally amazing and every plate was clean by the end.  Mushroom tagliatelle was flavorful and full of mushrooms.  Trout was perfectly prepared and super crispy.  Steak was done perfectly and came with neat little onion cups.  Dessert was equally great - I had the 'Chocolate Bar' which blew away my expectations - very delicate flavors and textures for a simple dessert.  Ice cream and parfait was also well enjoyed at the table.  Service remained excellent throughout the meal and very fast.  All dishes were always brought out together by a team of four, and the table was cleaned and reset after every serving.  Decor is great here as well, especially if you like movies.  Even if you don't, there's an awesome fake 'window' that changes scenes throughout your meal.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch @ 12:30...  We came into Montecito for a brunch, and while a little uncertain about a $35 brunch buffet given the city's bevy of options, we decided to give it a try!  We were greeted with a, \"Good evening\" and an eventual admission that our server didn't get any sleep.  Another bartender snidely remarked that \"we must have him confused for someone who takes pride in their work\".  Our waitress for the brunch, while agreeable, brought little warmth to the service and didn't make up for the rest of the tired looking crew.  The food was great, and the sausages, mac and cheese and salads really stuck out. Fantastic food that was worth the price of admission.   However, the entitled air of the staff was too much for the ambiance and quality of the food.  Good response from Management when we informed them, but 2 stars until another potential visit."}
{"text":"Food was great, service excellent.  Love the atmosphere.  It wasn't mindblowing hence the 3/5 star review but it's a definite spot to go to again.    I ordered the roasted squash salad to start and it was really good.  Love the mix of flavours, however, I personally wasn't a fan of the greens they used but I'm sure others would find it enjoyable.  For the main I had the duck confit and it was really tasty, it fell right off the bone - I didn't even use a knife!    The washrooms are well kept and  very quaint, I liked them very much.  I liked the music, it wasn't too loud and overbearing, and it set the tone of the place.  I love the interior design - the chairs were very spacious and the restaurant was dark lit and romantic, yet not so dark you could trip on a stair.  Service was on pointe, the server very courteous and efficient - he was very attentive.    The menu was quite selective, there wasn't much to choose from and I wish there were more options available."}
{"text":"We had a previous poor experience that Jamal, the new GM turned into a great experience. Make sure you introduce yourself to him. It will make a world of difference."}
{"text":"The Charcuterie board (which we didn't post a photo of) was forgettable, actually, we wanted the proper board, but they only brought us the meat board. We couldn't wave our waiter down to get it corrected.   The tomahawk steak was absolutely delicious. Right at the beginning of the meal, we asked for more gravy, and asked another server for it mid-meal. But at the end of the meal, we still didn't get it.   JW potato was ok, the roasted potato was superb.   We were celebrating a birthday and the waiter said he can bring over a dessert on a nice board with the message written in chocolate. My husband decided there wasn't anything on the dessert menu that he was interested in. We asked for the bill, the waiter brought us two dessert on a board and charged us $22 for it, when each dessert was about $8-10."}
{"text":"I am improving my rating for this place. This is mainly due to the Friday Champagne and oysters, which was excellent. We also had pizza, it was good and the service is still excellent. However, I still find the food a bit casual for this place. I find it fits well in the bar but my expectations for the dining room are higher."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and some snacks. Good selection of beer on tap and by the bottle. Some really funky cocktail options. Wine list looked extensive but that wasn't what we were drinking. The charcuterie platter and olive/bread dish were both really tasty. Service was good but not great. Would go back again and have dinner there. Some of the entrees looked really good."}
{"text":"Restaurant was great about accommodating us and getting us a table for 5 outside on the patio.  Waiter was great!  Food was delicious!!  I had the tagliatelle and ate every last bite Had a great time and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing food! Pork chop was big and juicy, vet flavourful vegetable base. The individual mains are great! But if you are coming in a group of 4, go for one of the group menus. Comes with sides and fantastic presentation.   Also check out the menu before deciding when to come. There are specials each day of the week. 1/2 off pizza is a great appetizer for a group. Since its was Tiff week we almost didn't get the 1/2 off pizza, but they gave it to our group since then said the special was available when I called to reserve a table."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one Saturday with 2 of my girlfriends.  Restaurant was beautiful and completely empty except for one other family. Instead of seating us at a regular table, they put us at a larger banquet table with lamps that blocked me from seeing my friend sitting across the table.  So awkward! We had to shift one seat over so everyone could see each other.  We were never offered the prix fixe menu and so ordered from the regular menu.    Bibb lettuce, heirloom vegetable salad ($12)- laughable.  Portion was ridiculous - some lettuce leaves and tiny bits of vegetables.  Buffalo mozzarella, tomato, basil pizza ($15)- decent but not anything special.  There was an egg but it didn't add anything.  3rd dish - I can't remember the name but it wasn't supposed to be a play on steak and eggs except the steak was ground up and tasted like a hamburger patty.   Service was weird- our server talked very slowly and acted pretentious. Everything he said sounded incredibly fake, I'd rather he not have spoke at all.   Overall, none of the dishes were terrible but they weren't special either.  Was expecting much more from the team behind this restaurant.  Will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"A little bit pricey, burger was eh-ok, the space was nice, and the service slow. Would consider coming back in a few months to see if the service has improved. If you're a group of more than 2, don't be convinced to sit in the bar area - the tables are too small for three table settings. Good milk buns! I believe an ode to the kind at OMG Baked Goodness."}
{"text":"I tend to avoid large restaurants because in most cases the food is lacking but not the case with Montecito. Food is innovative, fresh and made with a lot of love. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends after a movie. The service is excellent. The food was delicious.  Three of our group had the JW chicken which was delicious. Would certainly order it again.  The ambiance is Californian and it got a tad noisy at times. Would be a perfect  place for groups or before/after movie fare."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Stopped in for a late night dinner w/ friends and ordered family style. Kale Salad with anchovy dressing, pecorino is a must-order. I would never have ordered this - but my friend insisted and glad she did - it's incredible. Spicy salami pizza was definitely above average - but didn't meet my expectations - not very hearty. I love sauce - and the chef doesn't. Squash Gnocchi excellent . . . Desert: StayPuft Bar, coconut mousse, chocolate, marshmallow ice cream and  Bourbon Cake, candied apples, bourbon-pecan ice cream - both excellent and the presentation was quite elegant. Service was superb. Decor - very open and well-appointed. Movie stills pepper the main dining - very appropriate given the owner's pedigree. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"\" A pleasant, not memorable and somewhat pricey dining expérience... \"   Montecito's \" new American \" cuisine with its comfortable, big room modern decor, should make for a pleasant evening out on the town.  Black and white frames  of vintage tv shows (featuring photos of John Candy, Bill Murray and the like) adorn the walls alongside the soaring high ceilings. The right end of the dining room incorporates digital screens with dynamic scenery and decor to create an techno escape to a garden pond feeling.  And true to its American foodie focus, there is a Julia Child cooking proverb etched on a giant glass panel above the hostess counter by the entrance   Now for the food; their menu changes by the season.  Appetizers are shareable and our group had The kale salad with Parmesan and garlic focus which was memorable ($13), the individual spicy pepperoni pizza was tasty but was overpriced for the portion size ($18), as was the Canadian charcuterie tray ($35) which had a few porscuitto, salami meat shavings, about three table spoons of cheap pâté, a few small triangles of assorted cheeses, some crusty bread slices with mustard spread and marmelade; it was good but nothing we would order again and definitely not worth $35!!! The price didn't match the menu's presentation and portion sizes whatsoever...  For the mains; the 6oz Quebec venison was extra rare and the waiter stated the kitchen Chef does Not want to cook it any other way, hmmm okay..... It was served with braised cabbage and espresso au jus ($40), it was quite bland and the portion very, very small.    The Montecito Chicken was panfried and served with salsa verse over arugula greens ($25); It was a decent sized chicken breast.    The Ontario Grass fed striploin ($38) came in sliced pieces (!) over 2 cabbage leafs, onion purée and mushroom pieces; it was skimpy for the portion but alla And all tasty.    The highlight of the meal was definitely the side of \" Northern Woods Mushrooms \" consisting of an assortment of various wild and unique, extremely tasty mushrooms which were sizzling with scallions in a black-garlic maple vinaigrette and were served in a cast iron skillet charged by a cedar wooden plank for  support ($10)  The dessert descriptions were extremely tempting.  The sticky toffee pudding came with three very tiny pieces of sticky cakettes with two table spoons of cream and caramel sauce; as was the chocolate ganache plate with candied marshmallow  ($12-14).  The dessert items were way way waaaay overpriced for portion and presentation and were not memorable, just okay...     To finish off the meals, we ordered tea and it came in a nice kettle with a press; nice touch!  All and all a pleasant dining expérience although not memorable and somewhat pricey for what you get. The urban chic decor and ambiance alone are not enough as Montecito does not deliver a rounded exceptional upscale experience Its pricing and menu are charging.    Onto other dining experiences in this hip neighborhood! #WayOverpriced #SkimpyPortions"}
{"text":"A very nicely appointed, upscale restaurant with huge comfy seats at the bar (half star for that).  The vibe is thoroughly grown up and mostly off trend (half star for that too). Like...chicken.  Who serves chicken anymore?  Montecito does!  Currently there's an excellent special on Fridays for $1 oysters and \"discount\" champagne - very, very awesome.  So I went for that, and stayed for food; then I went again; then I went again....both times on Sunday night.  The portions are large.  Kale salad is easily large enough to split and very good. Its salty crunch wins over kale skeptics.  The JW chicken & potatoes meet my approval;  the chicken is large enough to share if appetites are light.  The corn, which everyone appears to be doing right now, is also good.  I could be more excited about this place but something about the service isn't quite gelling for me....it could be tighter...or have more personality...the servers come across as a bit diffident. Perhaps they haven't hit their stride yet; or maybe they're usually hungover and tired on Sunday nights.   The overall feeling is luxurious, perhaps even staid with a tight menu.  You can take your mom here."}
{"text":"Loved the mound of kale with deliciously sharp pecorino cheese! My main, gnocchi, was pillowly and light; though, quite ordinary and plain. It would have been nice if the dish was either a little more rich/complex in flavour or more plentiful (the former being preferable). The main just felt so 'short' - incomplete. The desserts though were the stars of our meal!! Featuring a local cherry and peach farm the day we went, the desserts were beautifully plated and, without being too sweet, perfectly satisfying."}
{"text":"Staff are not very friendly,  Not that much of choices. Money-wise , this place is not worth it at all."}
{"text":"The food was good. I ordered a snow crab pasta. Decent quality but it is a little bit on the pricey side for things on the menu. However, it is spacious and normally you don't need to reserve. It is my backup place if I cannot get a table in other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today with a group of 5 and was looking forward to trying the JW/Jonathan Waxman dishes.  I wanted to like this place. Really.  The decor is nice and typically Finance District-feel:  Spacious, modern and open kitchen, high ceilings shared by a dual-leveled dining area, with large hung prints of the Ghostbusters cast and a retro-cute figure of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man that greets you at the door (I high-fived it on the way in, because I'm just *that* classy).  The food, which I believe should be at the forefront of any dining establishment, was OK.  Had the 3-course prix fixe lunch for $25, where I chose a French onion soup, a grilled squid on salad, and a chocolate budino.  I found the onion soup to taste like a beef consomme, and one of my dining companions found it overly salted.  The squid looked like chicken, and lacked the bouncy \"spring\" that one might expect.  The chocolate budino, served in an espresso cup, was pretty good.  Based on the details above, I would've probably rated it at about an OK 2 or 3 stars.  Here's where it all went downhill for me:  the awful, awful service.  The waiter, whom another of my dining companions had immediately described as \"apathetic\" (very apropros, by the way) was visibly annoyed that we didn't order wine or drinks.  I could've looked past this; but it was the service that followed which really cheesed me off.  Er, rather, the service which *didn't* follow.  We were served the first course after about 10 minutes, which is fine.  Our entrees?  We waited 50 minutes for our entrees while the 2-person table next to us was served at least 20 minutes before us. When our waiter noticed our entire table looking to wave him down to inquire about the status of our dishes, he went to the kitchen to ask them about it, without ever coming over to our table to give us an update.  Another 10 minutes later, we waved down another wait staff to ask about it.  She followed up with him, and I suppose upon realizing we would ask eventually, he came to our table with a very nonchalant, \"Your dishes will be ready shortly.\"  No apologies, and no mention that something had clearly gone awry.  He never once asked us if we'd like a refill of water (after an hour long wait? Yeah, water would've been nice).  Never asked us how the appetizers were, nor even glanced at us to recognize we were hungry as heck since we'd been sitting there long enough to dry up like The Cryptkeeper.  At the end of our two hour endeavour, there was zero mention of the fact that we waited, zero compensation for the super long wait (uh, even Starbucks gives you a free drink coupon after waiting ~10 minutes), no question of whether we enjoyed the food, and worst of all, two of our companions had to leave to go back to work where one of them paid for a dessert but never had the chance to eat it (but was still charged for it nonetheless).    It's a known faux-pas to name competitor names in reviews, but this experience left such a sour taste that I'm straight-up calling them out (oh snaps, can't take the Malvern out of the girl).  Montecito is a dime-a-dozen, and I highly recommend that you avoid Montecito and go other restaurants in the area: Gusto 101, Buca, Tutti Matti, Byblos...any of these places would be better than this. Some of these places are also a bit on the pricier side, but at least at those places you're not paying to be ignored!"}
{"text":"I came here for a friends birthday during Summerlicious. I was glad to have not gotten anything from the summerlicious menu as most of my friend regretted it. I ordered the vegetarian gnocchi...which was served cold and was basically canned tomato sauce with 7-8 pieces of gnocchi with some garnish. It tasted so basic and bad that I had to tell the server who was nice enough to replace it with their summerlicious vegetarian dinner...another huge disappointment. Basically raw vegetables in canned tomato sauce.  For an elegant restaurant that is beautifully decorated the chef(s) were not able to execute or make a proper meal. My friends who had also ordered the pizza, steak, and chicken dish complained about the bland taste.   This place is pricy and portion sizes are extremely small so you are basically paying for the interiors and fancy King Street location. The customer service okay and they charge you a \"cake cutting fee\" if you bring in a cake.   Would I come back here? Ofcourse not. For a so called Italian restaurant they sure did not know how to make Italian food. Save your money and time and go to Cibo Wine Bar or even Scadabush, least you'll get a decent meal."}
{"text":"In Toronto for TIFF went with some local friends trying out  the new place. Good points the rest rooms (bathrooms) private each with their own sink and beautiful brass fitting ( my favorite part of the decor) timeless elegant great. There was also music playing in each self contained room. The dining room was nice, I didn't love all of the decor, there was a lot going on but, the general ambience was nice and the acoustics were good (we could here each other talk).  The food was all okay, none super, none terrible. The menu is not great for vegetarians, pescetarians only a few options and nothing too exciting. The tuna crudo was slightly fishy and bland, kale salad good,  not too much anchovy, the green salad tasted like wet fresh greens ( I asked for more dressing it helped). I'd dry the greens better. I had a pasta with butter and herbs. It was homey, very buttery ( your kids will love it). My friend ordered the chicken it was okay but she liked the chicken better the previous night at  Drake 150. Our other pal had the halibut which he said was a bit over cooked. The staff was along the level of the food, not terrible not great.  I haven't seen Ghost Busters so I didn't get the food references.  Are the large moving images through the faux windows Mr. Reitman's view from his security cameras from his home in Montecito? We wondered. Maybe you shouldn't trust a girl that hasn't seen Ghost Busters? Or maybe the restaurant is new and their working out the kinks? I don't live here but I don't think I'd rush back if I did but, if someone really wanted to go I'd give it another chance."}
{"text":"The food here was okay. We got the charcuterie board to start and then spaghetti and pizza for the main. It was a bit pricey but they kept talking about their farm to table movement so I imagine that that drove up prices. However, their service was pretty bad (which is even worse if you factor in the price aspect!). We walked in and there was really no one in the restaurant. They asked if we had reservations and we said no. They said they only had bar seating then. Fine by me especially since I thought they were expecting a huge rush of people since it was a Saturday night. Well an hour later as we were walking out we noticed there still wasn't really anyone there. The restaurant was mostly empty. Very pretentious which goes against a lot of the principles of farm to table."}
{"text":"Not the kind of place I visit normally but it was near the AGO and my best friend happened to know a lot of the staff that worked here.   Right away we were welcomed as if we were long time regulars. We sat in the lounge and chilled at the bar. The bartender was super friendly and he had a good chuckle at my expense for being a bartender at Chez Serge in the past.   We got beers, oysters  (from new brunswick.. I forget where to be exact but they were small and tasty) home-made hummus and the cheese platter. The cheeses were delicious and I'm pretty sure the bread was made in house. Nom nom nom. But I think what I preferred was their house made hummus. Very delicious but not the kind of place I normally would frequent.  If you are looking for a very high end meal paired with great wine, I feel like this would be the place. It was great to chill too but the clientele wasn't the type of people I find myself amongst normally (think professionals that work 9-5s...  I'm a punk at heart.)  I definitely recommend Montecito if you dig oysters and the finer things in life."}
{"text":"Lunch during tiff. The decor is very upscale and beautiful. Our waitress was helpful and pleasant but not knowledgeable. We ordered the bread with cultured butter which apparently comes from Kensington Market. Bread was fabulous but pricy @ 7.00.  We both ordered the Skirt steak, rare. It was chewy but not bad. However it came loaded with soya sauce which totally took over any flavour. That was really too bad."}
{"text":"I had low expectations going in, and they were met.  There's nothing unique about this place.  If you are touting yourself (Ivan Reitman, Jonathan Waxman) as filling a void that Toronto has, or coming in to do something interesting for Toronto, than you have to deliver.  You can't just bring an expensive room with boring food, uninspired cocktails, and expensive to boot.    I thought the service was adequate to pleasant.  Sat at the bar on the main level.  Seats were uncomfortable.  They have coat check, that's always nice.  Bartender was nice, but the drink list and choices were so boring, and nothing was very good.  They give you some cheap popcorn to munch on in a little bowl.  Nothing on the menu looked good, so I decided to order the baked alaska \"stay puffed marshmallow man\" deal.  It was so not interesting and I would expect the level of taste from a Loblaws purchased dessert.    I would never go back and couldnt recommend it to any person I know."}
{"text":"I went to Montecito on Saturday night with a group of 4. We all Loved the ambience. There are screens above the windows showing moving images of gardens, ocean, trees and other lovely sights one doesn't get to see in Toronto at the end of November. The restaurant is spacious with high ceilings and 2 floors.  The service was great but there were some curiosities: They only brought 2 side plates for a pizza we were all sharing No plates or butter with the bread The by the glass wine selection could be improved.   The food was excellent! We had: Pizza with basil and Buffalo mozorella - 5/5 flavourful with plenty of basil and delicious crust.  Lamb sirloin - 5/5 lamb was cooked to perfection and beautifully seasoned. This dish came with a very complex potato side which I loved.   Root vegetable salad - 5/5 this is served chilled. Honey glazed root vegetables atop labneh and a cranberry jelly.  I did not get to try the other dishes, but my friend who had the pasta with meat balls really enjoyed it.  For Desert we had: Cheese cake - 3/5 this was a small whipped cheese cake with the crumble on the side. There was a citrus glaze that I didn't care for.  Peanut butter parfait - 3/5 this was like a cool chocolate peanut butter moose. I loved the contrast of the salty peanuts on the side but overall I found this dish a bit too sweet and rich.   Please keep in mind I am generally not a lover of desert, so you may enjoy these more than I did.  The portions are small ish, but I thought they were perfect. I don't love feeling too full.   We all agreed we would return to Montecito!"}
{"text":"I wanted so much to like it, to love it. But I didn't. I thought for sure this would be the highlight of my dining experiences in Toronto,  but it was so far beneath my experience anywhere else that I'm actually writing the review in the dining room. The space is very nice, the host sat me right away, and the Pimm's cup was excellent,  but that's where the positive part of my review ends.   Service was decent, but the team serve setup was odd.  There were so many staff milling about, and I was likely served by each at some point. One took my drink order, another brought it, still another took my dinner order, and so on.  The corn chowder was fine--certainly nothing to write home about. It was blended to a smooth texture and was made of corn. That's about all I can say. The polenta has no redeeming qualities. It was awful and I feel disgusting having eaten as much as I did out of sheer hunger. It was so greasy! There was so much goat cheese and oil mixed in that it was unrecognizable as polenta. It was like eating a cream sauce. The baked Alaska, their signature desert, failed to wow as well. I've no basis for comparison, having never eaten it before, but it was \"meh.\" Very sweet, but not very flavorful somehow.   Maybe my expectations were too high,  but it was a singularly disappointing experience."}
{"text":"This is a lovely brunch spot. It pleasent lay surprised me for sure. It was waay more relaxed than I was picturing it to be and the service we has was great. Best on a nice day because they have cozy sofas and seating on a wrap around patio which is a very good size for dT! I had their  eggs with ground beef and onions mixed in it and YUM my mouth waters just thinking of it! My Americano had great flavour, not the best Americano I've had but very solid. I like their selection of meats they had for a charcuterie board and it had nice presentation. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Great menu - Northern California Italian is how I would describe it.  Fantastic location, comfortable setting. Decent selection of hipster cocktails.  The chocolate mousse is an 11 out of 10. Maybe even a 12."}
{"text":"Birthday Dinner Disaster!   I recently went to Montecito to celebrate my birthday and had the worst experience ever. This restaurant, its staff and management team need to go through customer care training. I made reservations through AMEX Platinum Concierge since Montecito was one of their platinum dining partners and I would receive a receive a free dessert platter. I choose Montecito based on their online menu and their vegetarian main of the Wild Mushroom Ravioli. The Concierge team had advised Montecito of my dietary restrictions and that I was celebrating a birthday. At the restaurant, I was told by the waiter they they recently changed their menu (different from their online menu) and would not offer any alterations. Their new menu had no vegetarian mains! I told him that I was celebrating my birthday and that I made reservations based on the menu online, he said unfortunately he could not help me and I that I should choose something else. At this point, I was considering leaving and going next door to Figo- I wish I had! I ended up asking for the manager and explained to her once again that I chose Montecito based on their online menu and if they had changed their menu they should have updated it online. The manager- Jenn Gallay asked me if I was the vegetarian who had called in earlier and then offered to give me one of the 3 portions of the Wild Mushroom Ravioli that they had (so it was available!).  After just finishing our appetizers, Jenn had come out with our desserts.. Looking at our confused faces, I explained to her that we were still waiting for our mains. She said their must have been a mix communication with the kitchen because she was under the impression that we were done eating. When we got our bill at the end of our dinner, we noticed that they had overcharged us for the Mushroom Ravioli. I had to ask for the manager again, and when Jenn came by I explained to her that the mushroom ravioli was not the same price as the braised ribs that they charged us. She said that her cooks told her the price and was sure it was correct, I had to pull up their online menu and show her the mushroom ravioli was actually cheaper than what we were charged. I also thought it would be fair for me to explain to her how the night went and my first experience at Montecito- I wouldn't come back again. Jenn, this was the opportunity for you to make it right, apologize for the experience and offer to give me a discount on my meal instead you told me to \"email you\" and you would make it right for my next visit. Sorry but you already lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"I walk by Montecito's every day on the way to and from work, and had been meaning to check it out because I was so charmed by the ambiance I could see through the window. The seating accommodates groups, dates, and more causal lounge diners. They have a really cute bar area that faces Adelaide street. We stopped by later in the evening for a small meal; the three of us ordered the cod main, which was \"fine\", pizza salami, which was good, and I had a trout \"tartare\", which was just terrible. Honestly, there wasn't even lemon on it; it was just chopped up and thrust on a plate with a rice chip. It looked more like mauled bait than anything else. Server kept scowling because I asked for bread (sorry girl, how on earth would you have eaten it?). Treated us a bit unprofessionally, probably disappointed that we weren't having a full meal at 9:30 PM, but she'll do better if she learns to keep decorum. Crowd is older."}
{"text":"Had the most amazing dinner here last evening, the patio was the perfect setting for a date night for myself and my wife, the warm evening of Toronto great music and a gentle wind.  The service was prompt but not intrusive, the knowledge of our waiter was excellent.  I had the lamb pasta dish which at first I thought the portion size was a little on the small side but when I took my first mouthfuls of food it was amazing and the portion size was perfect.  We had a Malbec wine to accompany our meal which was perfect only for all to be topped of with THEE best cheesecake we have EVER had.  Nothing less than 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Had a great dining experience at Montecito. I ordered the Skirt Steak that was served with Chinese broccoli and a black bean sauce, it was fantastic. My friends enjoyed the Spicy Lamb Sausage pizza and the Braised Beef Shortrib. I love how this restaurant adopted a Farm-to-Table approach (I wish more restaurants would follow suit).  The menu changes regularly to guarantee only the freshest produce and meats are being used. It's totally worth paying a little extra for superior quality food, and it's local! You'll feel good about supporting local farmers!  It's also just a fun spot. There are old Hollywood photos scattered about, but it's done in a classy way (not in a Hard Rock Café kind of way). Perfect for a date night or an evening out with friends. The space is huge so they can easily accommodate large groups. Most importantly, this is a great restaurant in the Entertainment District. For all you non-Torontonians who come to the city to check out a show in the Entertainment District, go to Montecito rather than one of those tourist traps around King & John Street. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is a very place a little tucked away from the main stream. The venue is classy enough to make you feel comfortable but the food is more on the comfort than gourmet. Service was top notch and staff was very friendly. I would have given it a 4, but the food is still the main goal of a restaurant I think.  I had the prix fixe for lunch and took the entree, main, dessert combination.  The entree was a onion soup. I was expecting a French style onion while the presentation was nice, cheese and some chopped green onion on top, the soup was on the blend side.  I then had the Orrechiette with fontina (pardon my Italian) and another dish on the blend side.  The fontina was tasteless and altogether it was a bunch of pasta in cream.  The dessert was a banana bread with latte dulce. Not to sweet and just right.  Overall, pleasant place, dished well presented and very good service but lacking taste in my opinion. I imagine that if you are looking for expensive comfort food, it will do the trick."}
{"text":"This is my third time at Montecito, they have the best  kale salad in the city. Service is always attentive and food is always consistent. They serve traditional and classic fare and focus is on food done well. Not the most creative menu but extremely well executed. Do try the Porkbelly Kimchi on a milk bun for lunch, JW chicken for Dinner and always get the Stay Puft Baked Alaska. Will be back for sure and I already recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this new restaurant, and the experience could not have been better. From the courteous and attentive staff, to the delicious food and perfect table for two, we could not have been more pleased. We also found a new delicious drink: The Pimms Cup.  At one point, we did sense that the entrees took a little long to come out, but it's usual for a new restaurant.   The table for two in the main dining room is the best table for two in the city. There is banquet seating on either side with a pillow to make you comfortable and bring you closer to the table which is large enough to seat four. Tons of room!   I must emphasize though, how amazing the hostess and our server were. There seems to be a growing trend of \"indifference to service\", especially in trendy restaurants where it is deemed to be cool to treat people badly, or have an air of superiority over the customer. Not at Montecito. I truly felt that everyone we came in contact with was authentic and happy. Do not ever lose this."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday to celebrate a friends birthday and it was a pretty good experience over all.  Started with the oyster special and they were really tasty and not skimpy at all.  Then the three of us split the bone marrow, black bird bread and tartare. The food was all very good but way over priced in my opinion, which is why I didn't give five stars.   The staff was very pleasant though and added a lot of nice touches for my friends birthday.  Overall I would recommend - especially on Friday for the oysters!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to dining here for a Christmas dinner with my colleagues. Unfortunately the service was poor, food was average and prices were high. The good company is what saved the evening.  A large portion of perfectly seasoned kale salad was the highlight of the night. The burrata appetizer was a nice portion size, but was accompanied by a strange topping of what seemed like sweet cereal. I ordered the snow crab sopresini for my main course. The portion of crab was generous but the salt overwhelmed the entire dish. I also found some pieces of shell in my pasta, not exactly the crunchy texture I was looking for.   If you are in this neighbourhood for dinner, skip Montecito and head to one of the other great restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"- Meatballs were my fav.  - pizza was very tasty.  - tuna was nice.  - prosciutto soup was awful.  - the curry eggplant app had a really nice flavor.  - loved the wine menu.  - ambience was really nice.  - was sat immediately.  - service was great."}
{"text":"Food here was absolutely amazing! I went here with my family on Easter Sunday for the brunch and everything from the salads (kale particularly!) to the pancakes (chocolate - special order) to desserts (apple cobler) were fabulous! Definitely recommend going here if you're in the downtown core! :)"}
{"text":"Just a few bites from our full experience Montecito Restaurant - \"The golden, handwritten sign has a sense of cursive fluidity, yet there is a second layer of coastal landscape giving it depth.\" \"The seating in that large room was also quite neat - double seat sofas for all tables, and, if you are really lucky, you could sit by their staircase on director's high chairs. Too bad we didn't get to try these.\" \"The veggies themselves were lovely deformed abominations, looking very organic with their skins perfectly dark and crusty. I don't think there was a single person on my table who didn't love this dish - it was taking us all back to childhood breakfast tables. \""}
{"text":"Convenient location and beautiful decor, average food, poor service.  Went for lunch with a friend.  Beet and burrata salad was fine but not exceptional.  I had the poblano pepper (healthy option) and it was fairly good.  My friend had the shrimp taglioni which he said was overpoweringly buttery.  We had some sort of chocolate cake for dessert and again, fine but not exceptional.  Service was unequivocally poor.  One server for an entire room of guests.  Waited 15-20 minute to order, another 15-20 for water, etc etc.    Overall: Good concept, nice space but food is average and service is sub par.  Would not go out of my way to go back but if I am in the area and looking for a place to go, may try it again (but even then, so many better choices within a stone's throw of Adelaide and John).  100x better than Figo next door however FYI."}
{"text":"Great place to come for dinner: special occasion, pre/post-theatre, or business in the downtown entertainment district. Food is amazing. Superbly crafted tastes in a beautiful environment. It's loud, but still conversation level. Have been here a few times and it is my first choice when in the area. It's expensive, but not ridiculous.  The Kale salad is a go-to favourite. Delicious, simple, and large enough to easily share for two.  Everything else is excellent, so no other recommendations. Menu changes regularly, so look for what interests you and go for it. Portions of mains tend to be smaller - because they are complex and rich in flavour (and often calories). Sides are large portions - perfect for sharing at a table of 4.  Desserts are intriguing and deconstructed variations on different favourites. All have been tasty and memorable.  The only challenge I've had recently is trying to find vegan options because the chef seems to love cheese in many dishes, but that is normal for most restaurants. The one huge bonus option is the gluten-free pasta which is available on request."}
{"text":"Loved frequenting Barbuto in New York for JW chicken and potatoes, and can now can indulge in TO at Montecito. The restaurant itself, is large and gorgeous, the Scotch list is impressive (sampled a few sips of Talisker Storm) and the only prosecco on the menu is crisp and dry. Our server last night Dylan, was professional and attentive with great recommendations (Trout app and Cod main). He's also friendly and at-ease which adds to an ideal dining experience."}
{"text":"Just came here for a late lunch to celebrate a birthday and had an amazing time. Great American style restaurant highlighting fresh local ingredients. The restaurant is huge and L shape on the corner of Adelaide and side street. There are several private dining areas, a main floor and upstairs and a bar on the side. Washrooms a little far all the way up two flights of stairs. Very nice patio area outside as well. We were seated in the main bar area which had bistro tables and banquet seating. Our server was friendly and attentive. We ordered the Pimms cup for two, tuna crudo, steak Tartare, Fogo island fish sandwich, and Steak salad. For dessert, peach bourbon and the ice cream sandwich. The appetizers were nicely done. Albacore tuna bite sized with just the right seasoning and heat. Steak tartare uniquely done with mustard seeds and chives mixed in. Loved the toasted bread with olive oil and herbs. Fish sandwich was crispy and tender and very fresh. Hand made chips a little too salty. Steak was a little overdone but the tomato salad tasted great. Best peach dessert I had in a long time. Ice cream sandwich a good size and expertly crafted to maintain its shape and good ratio of cookie to ice cream. Today they were getting ready for a private function tonight for TIFF and bringing in new furniture for the stars. Inside scoop that they are expecting Margot Robbie later. Wish I was on the invite list! Overall trendy downtown restaurant with unique interpretations of classic fare. Feels like a place to be seen in. Will return for dinner and drinks next time."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place and upon arrival the room is quite striking with amazing pictures of Ivan Reitman and the many assorted stars he worked with. On one wall there are plasma windows displaying beautiful vistas that worked well. We were greeted professionally and the service throughout the night was excellent.   What lets this restaurant down is simply the food. I personally came to sample Jonathan Waxman's food and simply can't believe this is what his Other establishments are like.   We went for the JW Chicken (what Jonathan is famous for) and I had maybe three bites and literally couldn't  eat anymore and I'm a fat b'stard who is not even that discerning. It was so dry I wanted to spit it out but my wife wouldn't have been impressed. Additionally, the chicken was served with lettuce, a single piece and not a single vegtable in sight. Perhaps there were separate veggies but our waiter failed to mention it and I can't recall seeing any on the menu. My wife had the steak with mushroom butter sauce. The steak was thinly cut and certainly not any better than we get from the grocery store. They made me wish I was at the Keg and I hate the Keg. The sauce was bland and overall was just flavorless - oh, and it's the most expensive entree at $42.   If Tom and Padma came here from Top Chef, Jonathan Waxman's would surely have to pack his knives and go."}
{"text":"I went for brunch a couple weeks ago and all I can really say is I was underwhelmed.   I had a brisket hash that was pretty much just some potatoes.   I felt like a Wendy's commercial, where's the beef???     It was reasonably tasty, but lacking in the main ingredient.    When we left I took a quick pole of the 3 other diners, none said they would be back.   The consensus was it was ok, but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning. The woman at the front had some sass which was unexpected since it was Sunday morning (who has sass on Sunday morning?!) and the place was not busy at all. Maybe like 3 other tables. Anyway, ignored her terrible attitude and we went over and sat at our table (group of 6).   The place is nice. It's got good decor, clean and a nice vibe. Everyone ordered coffees, teas as we continued to look through the menu. It took maybe 10 minutes to get our drinks. I got an americano that was honestly a disgrace to any type of coffee I've ever drank. It was overdone and came in a pathetically small cup. It could of likely fit an espresso cup. Not off to a great start.  We then ordered our food. The table got the following: buckwheat pancakes, eggs Benedict, mushroom frittata, and some side sausage for the table (some people ordered similar things). The food took a longggg time to come out despite there being maybe 2 other tables. The portions are tiny and the overall food was weaksauce. So weak. The pancakes were 3 paper thin measly pancakes, the eggs Benedict looked depressed and the frittata didn't come with a side of toast (what the frittata?!). The weirdest part was that I asked for hot sauce (to spice up my flavourless frittata) and the waitress asked \"did you try this hot sauce\" while pointing at my friends dish. Like she whole heartedly expected me to ask my buddy to dip my frittata in his hot sauce (which came with his fried chicken) instead of getting me a new one (was this an attempt at save the world, save a dish kind of thing? I repeat, what the frittata?!). Anyway left here disappointed on so many levels. Would never recommend this place for brunch."}
{"text":"Decent decor and efficient service but... overpriced for what was very mainstream type food (competently prepared, but if you eat out regularly menu will definitely give you a sense of \"this again?\") and some sketchy sales practices.  We were a party of 10 and as such the bill (a very large one) had 18% gratuity included. Fair enough. However, the server neglected (?) to remind the 3 bill-payers about this at the end of the meal, with the result that one guest added an additional tip on top of this amount. When we pointed this out to the server, the extra tip was refunded with no apology. In fact she honestly seemed miffed.   At the beginning of the meal there was also heavy upselling of expensive \"family style\" options and larger bottles of wine. Likely instructed to do by management but...yuk."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner on a Saturday night at around 9pm. The dining area seemed to be full but we got a seat in the lounge area with no problem. Mix of families, couples, tourists and business.   Around the corner from the TIFF building, its a bit tucked away and never payed attention to it when walking by. The ambience inside was nice, felt large and spacious, warm lighting and plush seats. Service was nice, they also keep your leftovers packed up for you at the front to be picked up when you leave, which was odd but felt like a fancy touch.   Started with the fried zucchini appetizer. It was a large portion to share, I was almost full eating half of it. The zucchinis were cut very thinly and deep fried. The ones on the top were amazing, really crispy but the ones at the bottom got really soggy and greasy at the end.   I got the corn pasta as the main and it was recommended by the server. It was corn puree rolled inside pasta sheets like a cannelloni. The corn puree was good, but I wish there was actual corn it all just felt like mush inside. I also wish there was some sauce, the pasta felt reaalllyy dry.   This place isn't the cheapest but not out of reach, but for an almost $20 pasta, there are much better options around."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience here!!! Great food and atmosphere.  Great place for a date night! I went there for there steam whistle promotion where they brought in steam whistle steam weaver (1970 dodge tradesmen). Had my romantic dinner in the back seat lol Washrooms are super clean!"}
{"text":"Much older crowd. Mostly corporate employees. The hostess at the front were unfriendly and the general vibes are very pretentious although the decor is very well done and the place looks beautiful. Terrible service went for half price bottle of wine waitress messed up our order after I explicitly pointed to it on the menu and we had to pay literally double the price for the waitresses error. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This is a strikingly decorated, spacious restaurant in the heart of the entertainment district. Inspired by Ivan Reitman of Ghostbusters fame, you will find an assortment of memorabilia covering much of the works of Reitman and Dan Ackroyd. Just short of opulent, this is a very comfortable place to enjoy food and drink.   An extended business meeting led to drinks and snacks. I ordered the meatball appetizer on polenta for $19. This is a fairly small dish, with 3 golf ball sized meatballs with a tomato sauce on a polenta base. Nicely done, but not worthy of the price.  An associate had the lamb sausage for a similar price; it too was a small portion.   I didn't order a meal, since my craving for a ribeye was met with a $120 price for two diners. The other meals did not seem substantial or enticing. I'll bet they were good, but my value radar was not confirming.   It's a spendy, trendy place if you feel like a splurge."}
{"text":"We got a kale salad, a cheese and cold meats, the duck and a bottle of wine everything was pretty filling and our waitress was really nice helped us figure out thats really good."}
{"text":"The Kale Caesar was amazing. Main courses were also delicious. Only complain is a little pricey"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was a waste of time. Stale food with service to match. Avoid if possible."}
{"text":"If the restaurant manager is reading this, please train your staffs to learn how to greet. There was no single greeting given when I arrived and when I left the restaurant. Nice try charging premium price for mediocre service. It felt like the servers knew they were going to get 18% gratitude for party over 7 people and stopped trying.   Edit: #HopeYouCloseDown"}
{"text":"Overall, the staff were very nice and professional. If it were not for our particular waiter this review would get 3.5 stars. The hostess was very sweet and genuinely nice (unlike most fake happy hostesses). Our waiter was terrible to our table. He was extremely rude. It's unfortunate because all other staff were all so sweet and happy.   The vibe is nice. The lighting/decor is very pretty. We only had an app to share and the panda cotta to share, both which were delicious.  Other than the rude waiter, experience was okay!  Also to note, it's fairly pricey here. Is it worth it? I'd rather take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Took a friend to celebrate my new job and had an amazing dinner...highly recommeneded!"}
{"text":"Great food! The charcuterie board and pork schnitzel for lunch is the bomb.   The charcuterie board had plenty of great salty pig parts and canadian cheeses.  Pre-olive oiled toasted bread was a nice touch.   The pork schnitzel has a sweet breading with a generous about of arugula on top.  It was more like a pork katsu than a schnitzel but it was a favourite amongst my friends and I.   A little of a pricier option for lunch but you get what you pay for.   Service was also great!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner on a Thursday night around 9pm. We didn't have a reservation and were seated in the dining room right away. Order the Kale Salad and a side of their potatoes. Both were delicious. Highly recommend the salad. Also had the eggplant caviar as an appetizer which was yummy but small. My friend ordered the ricotta pasta which was extremely rich. Too heavy for my liking. Our server was very friendly and attentive. Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Ivan Reitman's Toronto establishment is a welcome high-end addition to the many choices of the vibrant Entertainment District.  We were a table of six adults away from the kids for a Saturday night, and the venue was the perfect setting for dress-casual drinks and dinner.  The server was awkward to start, and the drinks were slow to come from the bar, but the evening picked up from there.  We sampled many impressive items for starters- Eggplant caviar, the Montecito Board (cheese and charcuterie), the homemade cultured butter and baguette, and the ricotta plate.  My food highlight was the Kale Caesar- baby kale, chopped small with an anchovy dressing and toasted breadcrumbs for incredible texture.  My entree was the Fogo Island Cod, and while the fish was tender, the braised tomatoes were unspectacular.  i think I had meal envy with my friends' dishes- the short rib, the skirt steak and the chicken.  The skirt steak looked best.  Reviews were good from all.  Tip- the Montecito potatoes as a side dish are a must: boiled new potatoes, smashed then deep fried.  Yum.  Worth noting our server did a good job of being attentive to the food allergies of one of our group.  We passed on desert to go around the corner to Sweet Jesus, but were sad to see it closes at 11pm.  I am sure it would have been on par with the rest of the food.  Great ambiance; great fresh food with a Canadian emphasis; good service.  The bar area looks worthy of a separate visit.  Apps, entrees, cocktails and wine for ~$150 per head including tip.  Pretty good for downtown.  Great work all."}
{"text":"Enjoyed their Sunday brunch buffet for  $39. Thought it was better value and experience than the brunch buffet at Collette's. You can taste their effort to execute on Farm to Table principles. The spread wasn't as varied but you can taste the difference. Quality and delicious meats, cheeses, kale salad, scones, breads,creamed polenta, fried chicken, sausage and bacon, oysters, ceviche and smoked salmon. Can order fresh  pancakes and omelets from your server. Heartwarming dessert table offerings and coffee/tea. Service was pleasant and attentive.  A good way to relax and indulge on a Sunday!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Great service, great food, highly recommended. It's no surprise this place was rated one of the best new restaurants in Toronto. Went here for TIFF and I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience with the service but the food was superb. Since the bad experience the  restaurant's general Manger has since taken great steps to rectify the issues. This is a place that will turn a bad experience into an excuse to improve."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my Wife for her birthday.  The restaurant is a beautifully designed space that is modern and warm. If you are a movie fan there are some great shots posted of Reitman on set with actors from his more famous films which was kinda cool: ghostbusters, stripes, twins...to name a few.  Heck!  We even noticed he was sitting at the corner booth across the room which was awesome.  Anyways, more importantly the service was attentive and friendly but not rushed, which is always appreciated. The food was very good.  Had the cheese board and split the rib eye which was a quality piece of meat and cooked exactly as requested. Ordered the potatos...so good.  Place has a decent wine/beer list and a few specialty cocktails.  Nice place for dinner to celebrate a special occassion or check out celebs during TIFF."}
{"text":"Went for work dinner, and the interior definitely impressed - very quirky, cool, and hip.  The service was very good, our waitress was attentive and considerate.  We were waiting on two individuals for a long time, there was not a trace of annoyance from our waitress.  The kale salad was FANTASTIC, must try!  The garden salad was delicious as well!  The serving of food was surprisingly large, I ordered the chicken and I couldn't finish it!  Dessert menu was extensive and all the choices looked fantastic!  The only downside was the lighting - a bit too dim for my liking, couldn't really see the menu very well.  Good restaurant, definitely recommend.  PS. The sofa seats were rather deceptive, not as comfortable as I thought it may have been."}
{"text":"Given that Montecito is super close to both the Lightbox and the Scotiabank, I'm surprised it took me this long to check it out.  We arrived at around noon on a Saturday and the place was completely empty. I perused the menu and quickly decided on Joe's Special, which is advertised as \"chopped sirloin, wild mushrooms, greens, onions, eggs, parmesan, grilled toast.\"  As I've made clear many times before, my biggest beef with restaurants is food that arrives at the table warm. This was absolutely the case here. The food tasted as though it had been sitting out for several minutes and was barely even warm let alone hot. The cheese was, as a result, one big piece (rather than the stringy, gooey mess I was expecting).  Far more egregious was the fact that the two sunnyside-up eggs were overcooked. The yolks were completely hard, which is totally unacceptable in any scenario (let alone in a place where I'm paying $18 for a simple dish). The meat was chewy and overcooked, as well.  I feel like the cook was recovering from a Friday-night hangover and consequently didn't put even a modicum of effort into the dish. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Buck a shuck!! Fun with a larger group. Vibes aren't too shabby, but the oysters were good."}
{"text":"I chose Montecito for my dinner meeting because I had never been there before, and the ambience for a meeting to impress a client also with fabulous food seemed promising. But rather than sit down to an enjoyable and hearty meal, I was left embarrassed in front of my client.  Having never been to Montecito before, I had high hopes - there wasn't a lot of variety on the menu, but I thought that at least the food we did order would be superior, as having owners like Ivan Reitman and Jonathan Waxman, I'm sure they wouldn't have it any other way.  My client ordered the $22 Cavatelli pasta, I ordered the $15 Margarita Pizza, and we shared the $15 Kale salad.  But the only half-decent part of the meal was the Kale salad - which was plentiful enough.  The Cavatelli pasta was such a tiny serving, that it could barely pass as an appetizer, and the pork ragu in it was so bad (practically raw), that my client didn't eat that part of the meal. She left hungry.  My pizza was OK, but I too walked away disappointed and that evening, ended up with an upset stomach (not sure if it was from the Kale salad's dressing or the pizza itself).  Our bill totalled $63.23 (my friend also had a virgin caesar), and I left the waitress a 15 per cent tip because although the food was very disappointing, her service was fine.  I emailed Montecito to point out my issues, but never received an email back.   It's one of those \"I'll never return to this place\" restaurants."}
{"text":"Overall: food is tasty but, depending on what you order, portions are insufficient for a normal adult. E.g., the $34 lamb sirloin had 3 cubes of lamb with a handful of couscous, which I finished in 6 bites. My friend's cod had 2 slices of fish    On the other hand, the steak oscar and pizza are 'average' size so...a few of us sat and watched our friends eat while contemplating where to go post-dinner for more food."}
{"text":"I came here for a business dinner while in Toronto a couple of weeks ago. The place is very large but still feels very welcoming. My meal partners and I sat in the bar area at a table. The bartender was very nice and brought us our drinks really quickly. I ordered the French Word: Green Chartreuse, Luxardo Maraschino, Tanqueray Gin, lime, prosecco, fresh thyme. It was delicious and helped me warm up while it was freezing outside.  To start, we ordered the dirty Montecito potatoes, which were basically Poutine but with large potato pieces instead of french fries. They were so decadent and delicious and the portion was huge. 3 of us struggled to finish it and it was a starter! We also ordered the Maple Cured Foie Gras, which was to die for. It was so rich and delicious, I could eat that every night and happily gain 30 lbs for that dish. I loved it.  After those 2 dishes and some beers, we were already quite full so we left it at that. But it was a really nice location to sit and catch up. There is an upstairs dining area for private parties which looked really nice and a great place for holiday fetes. I'll definitely be back for that foie gras when I'm back in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my evening at Montecito.  I went with two friends on what was a surprisingly quiet Thursday night.  We sat in the lower-level of the elegantly modern dining room. I was the second to arrive and our server greeted me immediately and poured water while pointing out the cocktail and wine lists.  Our table of three shared bread, the prosciutto, buffalo mozzarella and asparagus starter, and selected gnocchi, pizza and rainbow trout for our mains. My friends shared the StayPuft sundae for dessert, which they devoured.    All the food was wonderful and my rainbow trout was done perfectly.    The service was on-point: friendly and attentive. We didn't feel rushed to leave which was nice, but also could be because it was a slow evening. That said, I imagine that the level of service we experienced was standard no matter how busy the restaurant happens to be.  What I thought was a really nice touch was that my friend who didn't finish her pizza, asked for it to be packaged up to take home. The bag/box was kept at the hostess stand until we left, when it was handed to her as she exited. A small detail that made a big impression.   Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Went here in a party of 4, for their oyster & champs special. We were seated in the back dining room then moved to the bar to take advantage of their buck a shuck special, the oysters were good however the champ was still pricey so we opted for wine & cocktails instead. The server also recommended some different dishes we all shared. It was a nice night.  It's a shame this place seems to struggle a bit because the service and venue is great! It's much larger Inside then it looks from the outside, it would be great to host a larger party or intimate date night. I think it has great potential, especially if it ran some more events to get some more people in the door? Even a happy hour if they're not already offering that."}
{"text":"Terrible service, really slow and if you flag down a random person they take really long to get your actual server.  Skip the gnocchi, and the panna cotta because those were terrible.   The ambience of the place is nice and upscale, and their pasta was tasty.  It could be a good date place. Oh and the washrooms are impressive single stalled beauties, +1 star for that."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner one night and the place wasn't that busy but for some reason service was extremely slow. We asked to be seated outside and that seemed to be a huge task for the waitress as she actually went to find another waiter to move us... She was extremely slow as she was too busy socializing with the people a table over like Im HANGRY!  I believe the menu changes often but I got the fresh spaghetti dish and it was tastey although the serving wasn't huge and there are many other Italian places I'd rather go to since they offer larger servings and better service.  We came here because it was on a list of the best patios in Toronto and although it was a nice patio I'm sure there are better. I also got the chocolate bar dessert and it was good as well but again not the biggest serving.  I probably will not return."}
{"text":"I went there and while there's a greg's birthday party running, gosh all that greg's friend was talking on microphone, I been listening to wt Greg did the whole night, he's coming to each of them office and  do something unforgettable, my night ended when Greg said a speech about his lovely wife julien. I had a burrata cheese 8/10 The 135$ ribeye 4/10"}
{"text":"If you're a food fan you come for the Jonathan Waxman experience. If you're a movie fan you come for the Ivan Reitman experience.    I came for the former. Although I was exposed to countless reminders of Reitman's illustrious career (posters of Danny DeVito and Bill Murray stared at me the whole time), I was left disappointment by the food:  1.  The chopped salad ($12) was pedestrian (although the blue cheese was magical).  2.  The JW chicken and potatoes were worthy of the name (I would hope so at $24 and         $9 respectively).  3.   The halibut was $32 of horrible.   4.  The Stay Puft baked Alaska dessert ($12) was sweeter and almost as intolerable as Beethoven.  Montecito is big and bold and loud.  The service is as mediocre as the food.  It reminded me of an expensive Moxie's with a little star power (that's not a compliment).    In the end, this restaurant was more like Stop! Or my Mom will Shoot than it was Animal House. In the end, I have to give it two stars in the Waxman world  and two thumbs down in Reitman's."}
{"text":"Came here with the wife for a classy dinner to celebrate our anniversary. Left with mixed feelings on the food and service. We ordered the kale salad which was great and the field greens salad which was descent. Our mains were the JW chicken and the pork chop. Both were tasty but lacked substantial sides so we opted for the zucchini fritti ($15). This was a disappointment. It was heavy, oily, crunchy but wet in the middle. It tasted like soggy fries left to bath in oil. Our main server was good but the supporting cast/staff needs to communicate to make the experience cohesive. When they came to clear the plates and asked \"how was everything?\" They should listen. I said all was good but I \"hated\" the fritti which is why it was untouched. I also told her not to pack it as we had other lefts overs. Sadly that member of the staff just smiled and neglected to pass on the message (I asked our main server if he got the message as we paid and he was apologetic). For an upscale restaurant I hope for better service. Lastly, my wife felt it was odd that the hostess walked around the dining room staring at people's meals and didn't really engage with the diners or ask how things were. I would have shared my opinion on the food. Too bad. I would have loved to love this place."}
{"text":"I think this place is doing so many things wrong from a food perspective, and from a service perspective, I'm just shocked.   But the one thing this restaurant has going for it that just makes it too perfect to not miss, is half price champagne and a buck a shuck happy hour. You just don't find that good a deal in the city.   So is it worth it? Yes, if you're stopping by for champers and oysters after work....just have dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had New Years brunch here with my parents and boyfriend and it was absolutely superb! The buffet-style meal was inviting and extremely well done. The food was high quality, gorgeously presented, and farm fresh. The staff were extremely attentive and made sure we left satisfied. I would go back, as well as recommend this restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"I came here upon a friend's recommendation and I have to say I was incredibly impressed with the service and the food presented in front of us. We shared the kale salad which came in a very large portion and I ordered the pork chop which is one of the best pork chops I have ever had. This was over a month ago and I'm writing this review because it was so incredibly juicy and flavourful in my mouth that it still sticks to mind. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been to Montecito close to 8 times in the past year - it never disappoints. I love this place from the food to the ambiance to the service to the cocktails. Oh my gosh the cocktails are amazing. They are serving the autumn spritz right now and it's delicious. I highly recommend the kale salad and the crispy potatoes - which are also served during Sunday buffet brunch. Yes, BUFFET brunch. You can't get this value and quality of food for brunch buffet anywhere in the city unless you're all the way in Hamilton? Even there it's more expensive than Montecito. They also have an upper floor that is great for private parties. We are having our corporate holiday party there and I couldn't happier with the venue."}
{"text":"Fine dining.. Unpretentious.. California style.  Feels like I'm dining in a open California Estate with understated old hollywood theme. With neat digital projected pictures that alters the mood.   Food is healthy tasting and prepared with a high degree of care.   Service is impeccable!  Recommend: Kale salad and Duck.   Great for a quiet dinner on an off night or a gathering of friends at the group tables."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch and had a lovely meal. Excellent selection of meats, cheeses, pastries and other delicious breakfast dishes. This is one of the better restaurants in the area. One of the best wine lists in the city as well."}
{"text":"Beautiful modern theme restaurant with delicious food.   Came here with a group of friends on a Friday night. I love the decor of this resto. They have really different Styles of tables and chairs that all goes so well together to give that high end and unique look.  When one think high end resto, it is automatically accompanied with expensive food which is not the case at Montecito. You will find most of the mains around $20-$25 which I think is reasonable for this neck of the woods.   Our party ordered an assortment of pasta, pizza and a catch of the day. First off, the lamb Ragu pappardelle is to die for!!!!! The Pasta was made perfectly al dented with a really savoury Ragu sauce.  My next favourite is the spaghetti and meatball. It's traditional, simple yet so delicious. Texture of spaghetti was consistent with the pappardelle and the meatballs was so moist and tasty.  I'm still drooling.   You have to go and try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Went to montecito for brunch and it was overall a great experience. Service was attentive and food was great.   I had the pork belly kimchi burger, it was a bit messy to eat but it was so delicious! The brunch pizza with a fried egg on top was also excellent. I would recommend the kale salad, it's perfect to share as an appetizer.   Only complaint: drinks were on the expensive side, mimosas and Caesars were $14. Food was reasonably priced. Will probably be coming back!"}
{"text":"First time to come to Montecito, right around the corner from my office. The menu looked ok, I decided on the Meatball pasta and specifically asked if there were any chili peppers /flakes in it (I have a nasty intolerance to chilis!) and was told emphatically \"no, there are no chilis\". Great, food comes and looks good, I take a bite and realize there are chilis it? What? We call our server, Heather, over and ask why there are chilis in the pasta? Her response: \"you only asked me if there were chilis in the meatballs, not the rest of the dish\"!  I normally wouldn't mention someone's name in a bad review but I found the attitude and response to this episode particularly egregious; unfortunate because the food was decent."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with a very trendy feel, the staff was friendly and attentive.  We had the special a salmon and though a very small portion it was delicious.   As an appetizer we had the meatballs and they were good, but if you are having dessert go for the cheesecake.  Don't hesitate if you are full because this cheese cake is not New York style it is small and petite and it won't take much space at all but the few morsels you have are fantastic."}
{"text":"Not the fastest kitchen. I don't really get the décor, but I don't really get ghostbusters either. Stunning duck confit. Brilliant execution of traditional French dish."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food and you can't go wrong with wine Wednesday's we had been here for dinner before and it was spectacular. Wine and apps made for s perfect night - the meatballs with plenty were a hit the pizza was perfect and the charcuterie was a delight. Service was perfect we can't believe this place only has 31/2 stars on Yelp. Some of the best service we've had in a long time. Highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic time. Everything we ordered was delicious. Martinis are overpriced, but that's normal for that part of the city (I live there, believe me lol).  Closed the place down and our waiter couldn't care less, he had a blast with us right until the end.  Great job!  We'll be back soon :)"}
{"text":"Every Sunday, Montecito offers a brunch buffet starting at 11 am to 3 pm.  Brunch isn't new at Montecito, but they recently revamped their brunch buffet, and added several new items to the menu. The 12,000-square-foot Montecito opened up its doors late 2014, and is a partnership between Hollywood director Ivan Reitman and Chef Jonathan Waxman. The intricately designed 2-floors space is very California-inspired with several Hollywood motifs throughout the restaurant including Stay Puft from Ghostbusters, and film clips from Ivan Reitman's directorial. Additionally, navigating through the different food stations was made easy as the buffet station was set in one large area. It also overlooked the open kitchen, so you can see the staff cooking away.   Although, the daily menu at Montecito is inspired by both owners' California roots, they are focused on using seasonal, fresh ingredients that are locally sourced from Canadian farms. The Sunday brunch buffet is $39 per person including unlimited coffee and tea, but patrons do have the option to add $5 for either a Caesar's or mimosa. Montecito's Sunday brunch buffet offers a selections of made to order omelettes, and pancakes, fresh breakfast and brunch items, an inventive carving station (not your traditional roast beef), charcuterie, assorted salad, chilled seafood, and an impressive spread of desserts. [I have posted several photos and an in-dept look on my food blog.]  I had an enjoyable Sunday buffet brunch at Montecito, and I noticed that the buffet was always being replenished. I really liked the variety of food, especially the addition of the seafood table. I was too busy taking a lot of photos of the food the first time around, so I am looking forward to returning to fully enjoy my experience (sans photo taking)."}
{"text":"Neat place! Sitting outside was great but it will be a lot better when the construction in the area is finally finished. Going here for lunch I had Jhe's special, chopped sirloin, wild mushrooms, spinach, onions, eggs, parmesan, grilled toast sharing a side of jw potatoes. I thought both were awesome and service was great as well."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday at Montecito yesterday with a group of five and brunch was fantastic!   Considering it was Easter Sunday, I thought the place would have gotten so busy that service could have been compromised. This was not the case at all! Our server was very attentive and even had the Sommelier come recommend us champagne catered to our palettes. He totally hit the nail on the head as we ended up ordering three bottles (they were half off - not sure if it was a one off special but definitely great!).   The Brunch buffet had great variety and hot foods were kept hot which is always a plus. Pancakes and omelettes are made to order and while the omelette weren't a stand out fare, the pancakes were to die for.   I received a call prior to my booking advising me of all the little details that I did not that think of but was great to know beforehand (e.g. seating time limit, late arrivals etc). Although I had known of the three hour seating limit, I never felt for a second like we were being booted out as we even took it upon ourselves to take advantage of the great lighting in the upstairs bar for a lengthy photo opp.  Would definitely come here again to try out their regular menu."}
{"text":"It was my friend's birthday on a Saturday but we didn't make dinner reservations. I checked Open Table last minute, and saw that Montecito had spots on Open Table, so we came here.  There's a pretty bougie feel to Montecito: the interior is very spacious with high ceilings, beautifully decorated, they have coat check, and apparently even host weddings! The upstairs is a nice lounge.   I informed the server of my lactose intolerance and she recommended a few dishes. I ordered a pork chop dish, which was the size of my face (although a chunk was fatty meat).  Overall good experience, this place is comparable to the other King West American restaurants."}
{"text":"We came here for cocktails prior to dinner at another restaurant we had reservations at.  We sat at the bar and staff and ambience there was great.  Bartenders are friendly and know their stuff.  They made some great drinks, appetizer charcuterie platter and warm olives with warm bread were amazing!! I will need to come back to try Dinner here one of these days."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with friends here last night. The service wasn't bad and our server was okay, but the food wasn't great. I ordered the classic chicken Caesar and when it came it was loaded with anchovies. Now, anchovies are a strong specific flavor that completely overpowered the salad. It wasn't mentioned in the menu that thy were there. When I told the waiter about it she was completely apathetic. I've never heard of a class is Caesar having anchovies in it, on top of bacon bits and chicken. That's too many types of meat I you ask me. My friend had the mushroom pizza and didn't finish it, we had the Pappardelle, which was also a forgettable dish. The cheeseboard was nothing special. He only dish that was good at all was the spaghetti and meat balls.  Meh, wouldn't go back here."}
