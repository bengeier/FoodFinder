{"text":"We decided to try the hibachi at Fuji.  They have 4 or so hibachi tables and they were busy mid-week.  We enjoyed the show and really enjoyed the food.  Very good.  It was a fun time!  The only minus is all of the hibachi tables are in a single large room and it can be very loud.  I recommend Fuji."}
{"text":"This is the best hibachi restaurant in Madison, hands down, and I would argue the best in San Diego, Las Vegas, or Milwaukee as well! Chef Han was wonderful, the entire staff was friendly and warm, and I just can't say enough good things about the service! I even got to do the egg roll trick! The food was outstanding, nothing else to say. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Today was our second visit in 8 days. Both times our wait was 10 minutes or less. Our drink and food orders were taken right away. Chef Han was excellent (very funny and entertaining for our kids). Our server Sunny was very attentive and checked in on us often. The hibachi food and sushi were delicious. 
My only suggestion to your management is to speed up the check out process. Both times we waited 15-20 minutes for our bill. Meanwhile there was a line forming out front for tables. Thanks for a great night!"}
{"text":"I've never had so much fun at a Hibachi restaurant. Chef Han was hilarious. We went for my girlfriend's birthday on the weekend there was a little bit of a wait but they had a bar so it was okay. We did have to share a Hibachi Table with other guests but they were all very nice and it made us have a lot of fun. I got the rainbow roll because I'm a little new to Sushi and it was perfect. My servers English wasn't very good but it was still understandable. That would be my only peeve. I will be coming back with a larger group."}
{"text":"Having dinner here was the highlight of my 2 day stay in Madison.  Husband and I (along with our dog) were given the royal treatment by 'Era' on the patio. Meal was fantastic....quite the menu to choose from."}
{"text":"Fuji's is a welcome addition to the area's gastronomical options.

Despite having recently opened, the experience was excellent.  I tried the yellow tuna and spicy tuna rolls, both of which were excellent, well rolled and delicious taste.  The quality was far superior to other sushi options nearby.  At $10.95 for lunch, if memory serves, this was a great deal.

My friend had the salmon bento box, which was also very good and reasonably priced.  The only word of advice would be to include dumplings with the bento box. 

We did try a side of gyoza dumplings, and they were very tasty.

The restaurant has a good vibe, and the service was attentive and friendly.  I would recommend adding low sodium soy sauce to tables/bar as a default option, but it was readily available upon request.

Overall, I would definitely recommend for those in the area.  It fills a longstanding gap in the area's restaurant portfolio."}
{"text":"A friend and I dined early on a weeknight and we were seated promptly. It took some time to go through the menu, as there are quite a variety of options and combos to make (though not as hard to decipher as VIP's menu). Off the bat, I would've liked a few more specialty rolls to choose from...I'd say there were about 10-12. A lot of mixed fish types (i.e. tuna + eel + salmon, etc), so rolls that have one or two fish would have been more appealing. I ordered a blue crab roll and it was excellent--large, flavorful, fresh, and elegant in its appearance. I also had a seaweed salad, a rather small portion I might add, but nice and fresh. Their hot tea is...unique? I couldn't figure out what it was, but it tasted like a combo of matcha, green, and gunpowder and was served in little ethnic kettles and cups. My friend ordered shrimp and mushroom udon noodle soup, which left just enough spiciness on your lips! It was a large serving too, enough to split between two people. I will note my friend did not particularly enjoy his volcano roll--actually said it was the worst volcano roll he's ever had. In comparison to my roll, it did look meek and less appetizing. I will be back, but as a sushi lover, I'd love to see a little rotation in the rolls!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service...  when I get birthday.. I get suprice and free dessert ice cream... we are so excited"}
{"text":"First time here. Sushi was great, timely as well. Service was also nice and friendly. For a Sunday night it was busy... No wait, but still plenty busy. As for noise, I noticed some other reviews complained about it. Look if your going to a hibachi restaurant, it's going to be noisy. In the dining area, where we sat, the noise level was fine. My girlfriend and I could have a conversation without a problem. All in all we will be back, great addition to west side & greenway."}
{"text":"Great service! Food was delicious, and well worth the price. We will be back, and will bring friends and family."}
{"text":"So good it was delicious and especially if you do hibachi it's fun a lot of these people just like to talk to you that's why give it five stars"}
{"text":"Was waiting for this place to finally opened and Now I understand the hold up. They really put a lot of thought into the design of the place.  Beautiful color scheme and colored light accents. Also the booth fabric is so pretty. So the place really had an amazing decor. 

The food lived up to the decor, the bento box was huge and very good. I also got the dumplings which was soft and sweet. And a double crunch roll?? Which was warm and cheesy it was very good. 

Foodie scale: 3.5
Value: 4 for the nice scenery 

I'll be back !!!"}
{"text":"Overall the food was really great and I love the sushi! We sat at the habachi table, the server was very nice to introduce everything on the menu but she forgot to bring us water and mixed our paycheck after. The habachi chef was friendly and he did give us free sample. It was a little bit disappointing that the chef kept making  fun of you. I was so scared and really wanted to left ASAP. If you like quiet places, I will never suggest the habachi table."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken lettuce wraps for pick up. They could handle their customers better. I got handed off and talked to three different people. 

I took them and ate them within the hour. Lettuce wasn't given in the shape to make a wrap, and the chicken, noodles, onions etc was a little too salty and nothing great. 

I look forward to coming in and having hibachi and sushi. Then I will update my review, but as of now I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"The dinner hibachi experience with Chef Dang was AMAZING! He was very funny and made the experience fun and interactive! Normally I hate fried rice but Chef Dang's was GREAT! I had to steal off of my boyfriends plate! Get the filet mignon rare you will not be disappointed! Will be requesting him from now on!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was really looking forward to eating here. Marred by slow service, an uninspiring lunch menu and nigiri that was so poorly constructed that the rice fell off as soon as I lifted it just a bit off the plate. Same happened with the second piece I had. Never had this happen at Takara or VIP."}
{"text":"There is Very Nice place, I had dinner here this evening, the food is prepared well. Nothing overly fancy. I've actually had much worse Japanese food in Middleton!

Definitely recommend this !"}
{"text":"Tried Fuji tonight for the first time with my family and an out-of-town guest. We sat at one of the hibachi tables because our guest had never been to one before, so we wanted to give him the experience. The spectacle of the chef with the tools and such was entertaining. My toddler daughter and our guest got a kick out of it. The food was good-- all fresh and had good flavors. As others have commented, the soup was good and the salad dressing is fantastic. If they sold it by the bottle, I would buy it all the time. Two criticisms of the food... two of my shrimp were not cleaned properly. Ick. And I was a little confused by the fried rice. The rice seemed a little overcooked, so it was fairly heavy, wet and almost gummy and the only thing other than rice in it was egg. I would rather just have a bowl of white rice and will probably order that next time. I will also just order veggies and maybe scallops next time and skip the shrimp. Nothing worse than shrimp that isn't cleaned :( 

One other issue we had was that the seats at the hibachi are too short. It makes you feel like a kid trying to sit at the grown up table. My husband is 6 feet tall and he even commented on it. It's like the hibachi tables are a little higher than a regular table height and not quite as high as a counter, so there is no perfect chair to fit. It made me physically uncomfortable and I was kind of aware of it the whole meal. 

So, next time, no shrimp, no hibachi table. But we will go back. The staff is great, service was great. And there is more on the menu that looked good that I want to try."}
{"text":"I went down to Fuji over the weekend. It is located at the Greenway station. The place is very crowded and the wait time can be a lot. I am not sure if they take reservations though. But the wait was totally worth it. The salad is one of the very best. I wasnt sure of the dressing which was used. But it was very good. Same goes for the soup. The chicken hibachi was very good too. The place is very nosiy though with everyone having a good time. The waiters do seem to be a bit overwhelmed. It took a lot of time to get the food and then to get the bill once we were done."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Outstanding ambience! The chef played to the whole room, not just our table and it was great! Kid friendly. My daughter who was the center of his attention most of the night loved it! She was smiling ear to ear after we left last night. Thanks for the all around great service!"}
{"text":"Well I felt I should review after some of the negativity going on in other reviews; by no means do I mean to disregard anyone else's experience.

My husband and I have been to this location before and both of our experiences have been great. We most recently went back on a Friday night around 515 for dinner. We were promptly seated (if you got there later there would be a wait). Our waiter took our drinks and apps in a timely fashion and got everything right. 
Our chef was absolutely awesome. He was upbeat, friendly, and kept us engaged the whole time. The food tasted great! I had shrimp and my husband had steak and lobster - everything was cooked to our liking. 
The only downside was we got our appetizer toward the end of the meal, but the waiter did a great job updating us on the status; there were a lot of sushi orders in before our app order. By no means a deal breaker.

A few things to address from prior reviews:
-Yes,  On a an evening during dinner, it will be noisy. The grills are in a large open area and each grill can fit 8-10 so it will be loud. 
-Yes, there will be wait times depending on when you go. Call to make reservations, however popular nights (Friday/Saturday) reservations cannot be made so plan accordingly.
-Yes, there may be some downtime between being seated and your waiter/chef arriving. They do their best to max out all the tables to keep the wait times down."}
{"text":"Ordered the filet mignon and lobster tail. Not only was it beyond delicious, but beautifully served. Ask for Chef Han when sitting at the hibachi tables. He's funny, entertaining, really knows what he's doing when it comes to cooking food, and gave us a great first experience! My dining experience was so perfect. I hadn't been on a date in a while, so it was really special for my boyfriend and I. The upbeat tone of this place left us feeling cheerful instead of that heavy drag feeling you get after eating dinner at other places. The manager was spectacular also, Kelvin was very helpful at seating us and helping find our Chef. Keep up the good work guys! Oh and the restrooms are really nicely decorated and clean :)"}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place for hibachi and haven't made it to this place yet.

We had the grill to ourselves on a cold Sunday evening. I wouldn't describe our chef as animated at all but he was polite, remembered all our orders and did all your flipping of the spatulas, egg spin, and volcano trick with a smile.

The course was pretty generous, you got soup and salad with your hibachi dinner. The salad was dressed nicely in a light, ginger vinaigrette and actually contained leafy greens with cucumber slices, carrots, instead of the typical anemic ice berg salad. 

Every hibachi dinner has the option to be served with fried rice for no additional cost.

I ordered the scallop and shrimp dinner $26.25. The jumbo sized shrimps (26/30 or 16/20) were deveined and cooked perfectly.  The amount of scallops were generous and unlike the portions I've seen elsewhere in Madison. Stir-fried carrots, broccoli and onion were crisp and seasoned evenly.

The staff definitely seem like a lively bunch with each other, chatting at the bar the social interaction extends to the patrons as well. The table next to us had a birthday and were showered with a Taiko march and a dessert with a cool tricked out candle that looked like a sparkler until it opened into a beautiful lotus flower.. on fire."}
{"text":"I can not believe how many people actually come to this restaurant. My families food was completely tasteless. No one in my family enjoyed this expensive meal. Our rice we were served was cold, and I could've stayed home and cooked better rice than that. I want my money back for this repulsive meal. Everyone was adding salt, soy sauce, and other special sauces to everything in our meals to make it taste like something. Very cute atmosphere but highly disappointed with this place and I will never recommend it."}
{"text":"For my mother inlaws bday, we took my mother in law and the family out for sushi. Ordered $100 in food. Finished the food. Then waitress finally shows up for refills. When we left, we left 15 for tip. She followed us out asking for more tip. If you do your job correctly and how you're supposed to do it, then yes you deserved the tip. But no!! She was away until we finished our food to refill our water and expect more tip. Never going back to shitty customer service. Feels like vip sushi all over again."}
{"text":"Really fun \"hibachi\" dining experience. Food was very tasty and abundant. The chef puts on a show that's very similar to what the chefs at Benihana do.  I would absolutely come back here if I'm in town again."}
{"text":"I noticed a new sushi restaurant opened in the Madison area so I had to go try it out! I live on the other side of town but luckily it isn't too far from my place of work so I convinced a coworker to grab some lunch with me there. The lunch special options were great. So. Many. Choices. My coworker got the Shrimp and Veggie Tempura Lunch box and it was a huge portion of food. She probably had two more meals worth of food in her to go box when we left. She tried the onion soup and let me have a taste too since I was unfamiliar. It was good! I got the sashimi lunch and was thoroughly impressed with the quality and cuts of fish that I received. The lunch also came with a cali roll and a house salad, how can you go wrong with sushi house salads? I love the dressing they use. I was definitely satisfied when I left and will be back for lunch soon. The only negative I could come up with is you may smell like the hibachi grill when you leave. Like another review mentioned the ventilation could be better but as long as you don't mind the smell of a grill, you've got nothing to worry about!"}
{"text":"When it comes to hibachi, most patrons know what to expect. I would guess that Fuji will check most of those boxes. Service was great and so fast. The ambiance was about what you would expect: separate areas for bar, dining room, and hibachi grills. The menu was also about what you would expect: a wide variety of options at typical prices. The habachi chicken and steak was pretty good, and the spicy tuna roll that I also ordered was even par with the rest of the course. The only noticeable shortcoming was on the fried rice (which I normally love) was sad and flavorless. 

If you're looking for habachi, sushi, or sashimi...you'll likely leave full and thankful for a good dining experience, but probably not looking for a postcard to write home about dinner."}
{"text":"I went here for a quick sushi lunch today and was pleased with the experience. The service was impeccable. I sat at the sushi bar and ordered the 2 roll lunch combo with a spicy tuna roll and an Alaskan roll. The sushi was good, not great. I wish the spicy tuna had been spicier and had more of the crunchy stuff in it (is it bits of tempura? I guess I've never quite known). The sushi chefs were very nice and even gave me a small sample plate of a spicy crab dish. The service was fast and I was in and out in about 20 minutes which is exactly what I had hoped for as I was on a tight schedule. Even though the sushi for me is only a 3, I'm giving the place a 4 because I've had very good hibachi at other Fuji locations and I like the decor. Plus, like I mentioned, the service was great."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place. There is a fun atmosphere and half the restaurant is divided into a hibachi scene where as the other is a little more dining. The seating in dining area is private. The decorations are tacky, yet fun.

Service was very prompt and polite.

We ordered sushi and hibachi. We were impressed by a few unique sushi choices on the menu. The actual taste of the sushi was relatively average. The hibachi was served with soup, salad, and rice. The meats were fine. A good flavor teriyaki sauce on the hibachi but i question if that is meant to cover up a lesser quality of food.

In comparing to other sushi and hibachi places I think this place is relatively average. Its enjoyable and I will return but nothing to crave."}
{"text":"Food is consistent and very fresh. Staff friendly, and they even remembered my order from before."}
{"text":"The tornado room is cheaper... I have to say the layout of the restaurant is spectacular and the sights and sounds are very good... However the restaurant is unbearably hot most of the time and the level of the table in conjunction to the height of the seat makes even very tall people feel short.  I have a few words... Uncomfortable underseasoned understaffed underwhelming..."}
{"text":"The decor in this place is high end & classy. Our chef was talented and amusing, can't recall his name. I ordered the filet & shrimp combo @ the hibachi grill. My filet was cooked perfectly meaning I asked for medium and he cooked it as requested. All the food (shrimp, fried rice and veggies) were cooked well. The problem was with the sauces. Too much soy sauce used for Filet. Too much teriyaki sauce in veggies and fried rice. Other than that the food was quite nice. Since I don't live in Madison, I can't say if and when I would return. However if I return I would definitely tell the chef while he's cooking to ease off on the sauces."}
{"text":"Han Sum was the best waiter I've ever had. Absolutely hilarious and cooked amazing food. Restaurants need more people like him. Great experience."}
{"text":"This was my second hibachi experience and it was pretty similar to the first. Very professional atmosphere. The food was delicious all cooked so well. I had the hibachi combo of scallops and filet mignon and this came with a soup & salad to start and on the side came rice, veggies, and two pieces of jumbo shrimp. The only thing that was kinda iffy was the wait time of the service, it took around 10 minutes to get our water and soup/salad. But other than that. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This is one great addition to Greenway Station!  Nice, friendly staff with a wonderful atmosphere and many items to choose from.  I had the Sushi Lunch $10.50 which came with choice of house salad and ginger dressing or Miso.  I opted for the salad and the dressing was fantastic!  The Sushi was perfect temperature and the California Roll the same.  I would highly recommend that you get a group of friends together and reserve a Hibachi table.  You won't be disappointed in the experience.  They are using high quality and it shows!"}
{"text":"I'm giving them 3 stars because the food is amazing but they need to step up their game in the customer service area. I work in the area and stop by often for take out. When you come in even the manager seems disconnected. Not a thank you just a take it or leave it attitude. Kick it up and connect with your customers and your business will thrive.
Ok so I have my food now and it took about 15 min . No one in the restaurant and 3 guys working the sushi bar 2 watching tv. Really?"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is amazing and definitely worth the price. My boyfriend and I go there often and chef Han always makes it such a fun and enjoyable meal. Chef Han always goes above & beyond for his customers. He even came in on his day off to surprise me and to help my boyfriend propose to me!"}
{"text":"We have gone here a few times and the service is always very good. We have only done sit down and not hibachi. Their lunch specials are great, my only complaint is that at lunch time they should make sure everything is actually warm, like soups. Ours was  lukewarm. And I'm not a fan of their hot tea, or else they burned it with too hot of water because it had a burnt smell and taste. We continue going  because we like the food in general and the great service."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Our chef was so cool and funny. He made the experience memorable. The food was made really well too!  I would go back"}
{"text":"Delicious rolls and awesome atmosphere. Service was reeeeeally slow but we weren't in a hurry, so it was fine. Definitely a good (but a little pricey) sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"The only reason I will give them even one star is because the food was phenomonal. The price was reasonable and we were seated fairly quickly. The portions were perfect and I truly feel like there was an excellent variety. That being said, this is the absolute worst restaurant experience I have ever had. I have never even written a review before and it was bad enough to prompt a review. While the wait was short and service was prompt, the experience was truly, truly awful. I was with my husband and his parents for a dinner while they were in town and we were seated fairly quickly in the hibachi section. A few moments later we were joined by a bachelor party of EIGHT 20 something men. While we were waiting for our table they were sitting at the bar doing shots, which I did not think much of. During dinner the experience was a constant pounding on the table, yelling,  and consuming of sake bombs. Literally, it was constant. I stopped counting at SEVEN. They were still going at it when we left. Who knows how many they had before that. Not only that, but the management and waiters were taking shots with them. If I wanted to go to a rowdy college bar, I would have done so. Our food was quite delayed because the waitstaff was more focused on their drunk crew at our table. There are private rooms to either side of the main area where we were sitting and it would have been much more appropriate to seat this group in another room. There were children and families on either side of us. One young man next to me almost passed out in his chair as he was so drunk. All we wanted was a nice family meal and I could not run out of there fast enough. The setting was not even suitable for conversation. The language was vulgar, the drinking was excessive, and it was not stopped. While my husband paid the bill I had to excuse myself from the restuarant as the bachelor party was about to take another round of sake bombs and I could not bring myself to watch them take a tenth or eleventh drink in a family setting. We were excited for this place to open and truly, truly enjoyed the food. The experience was so awful that we will never come back and we felt uncomfortable for hours afterward."}
{"text":"The service was pleasant. Ian waited our table and he was very friendly. We had maki rolls and bento boxes. Bento box had chicken tempura shaped into shrimp tempura. Mushroom like soup instead of miso soup. Everything else was okay. Not out of the ordinary. The maki rolls were good. Each had 6 rolls. The hibachi section was loud. The place is little on the pricer side. I have eaten better Japanese food in Madison."}
{"text":"Great service and rolls! DELISH!!! All the rolls were very tasteful! Definitely recommend! The drinks were good as well!"}
{"text":"Kelvin and Shine are awesome and the food was great! Great environment! Please bring the fire back or give people the option of having fire or not! Love celebrating our birthday here!"}
{"text":"Yummy filet, scallop, and lobster hibachi!  I loved the crab rangoons too.  My husband had a little bit of a miscommunication as to what was included in the deluxe combo, but he still enjoyed his meal.  I'm not a sushi fan but will definitely return for the hibachi, and my husband will just order specific sushi rolls next time!!  Very friendly service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here twice for lunch. Both times, service was slow. Slow as in waiting a 1/2 hr to get drinks, place orders, and the food arriving.  Great if you work in the area, not so much if you only have an hour for lunch and a 10 min drive. We thought it'd leave us plenty of time. Yes, the decor is impressive and  that helps set the environment as contemporary and indulgent. 

We ate the sushi roll lunch specials and made the mistake of ordering some spicy rolls. The fish mixed in were too mushy and had a smell of less than fresh. Definitely using scrapes there.

The 2nd time around, I ordered the three roll special and deliberately ordered one spicy tuna roll to see if the quality was the same. Yes, overly mushy and still smelled the same. I didn't bother to finish that roll. My order of a yellowtail with scallion roll was replaced or wrongly put in as a tuna roll. When I got the bill, it did show yellowtail with scallion on the list of rolls. The tuna and shrimp tempura was good. 
My hubs ordered the sashimi lunch with 7assorted pcs and a California roll. Great presentation and fresh tasting, but he expected more of an assortment. He received multiple cuts of the same type of sashimi. I enjoyed the California roll more than what I had, so that was a surprise to me. 

Overall, for sushi,  I'd stick to what's closer to the west side and maybe try the hibachi at another time."}
{"text":"Sushi was okay but nothing spectacular.  Decent variety of rolls to choose from and flavor was pretty good but we've had better. Also the quality must not be very good because my husband and i were both belching fishy burps the rest of our evening.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Just had my first experience here. We were lucky enough to be paired with their most charismatic hibachi chef. He put on a great show even though we were just a table of 3. The food was amazing. I had the filet mignon chicken and shrimp. I asked for the steak rare and was not disappointed. The chef had an eye for steak. The only reason I'm not giving a 5 star is the drink service was a touch slow. Still great food and atmosphere. Also everyone was extremely friendly. Our chefs name was \"some random asian guy\". Well worth the visit and I will be going again."}
{"text":"I'm glad our friends took us here because it's really good. My wife ordered the Black Dragon roll and Fuji roll and loved it. I was a bigger fan of the Fuji roll. I ordered the chicken tempura meal which had a lot of chicken and vegetables coated generously with tempura. It tasted great with the spicy chili sauce that reminds me of Mae Ploy's sweet chili sauce. The server was friendly and checked on us regularly without overdoing it. Next time we go, we'll try out the hibachi grill."}
{"text":"We went to Fuji last night for hibachi to celebrate my birthday and my mom's. It was a TERRIBLE experience. The chef was absolutely rude--accused my mom of being racist when she asked me if the rice was white or brown, and saying, \"I do speak English you know!\" (she was commenting to me about the rice, not him, and really her comment to me about her food is not his business). He kept going, making fun of her. My mom was mortified, it ruined our dinner completely. Her hearing is not good and he was mumbling insults--it was appalling and I regret inviting her. Then the chef went on to make fun of pretty much everyone at the table including saying to my Latino husband, \"this meat is like what they use in burritos, Senor.\" Yeah, they don't eat burritos in Venezuela--seems like someone who goes out of his way to call out others for racism shouldn't be obviously racist to a customer. 

DO NOT go to Fuji to celebrate an event. Our birthday dinner was absolutely ruined, I will never go back. Terrible, rude, unpleasant, mean-spirited."}
{"text":"This review is just for the sushi at Fuji. We did not try the hibachi. 

The sushi is decent, not bad but not great either. They have several rolls to choose from, which is nice. Not a lot of sushi places in town offer the variety of rolls offered at Fuji. We ordered the Middleton roll (we like this the best), the fancy rainbow roll, and the super crunchy roll. This last roll we liked the least. The pieces of fish were almost none existent in the roll, it felt like mostly avocado and cream cheese. The crunchy part was good though. The fish in fancy rainbow roll was at room temperature which is not good, it makes the fish feel too soft and mushy. Only this roll was like this, so it could've been a small oversight. My last gripe and this one is just a matter of taste, but they put too many sauces on the sushi. The sauces make it hard to taste the actual sushi. 

I know that from reading the above it may look like I hated the sushi but that is not the case. I did enjoy it. I'm just a little too picky with my sushi. 

The place is modernly decorated, very unique. The staff is very friendly and attentive. We sat down in the dining area, which is right next to the hibachi area. We could hear the hibachi chefs animating their tables and it sounded like a very fun experience. We'll have to come back another time to try the hibachi."}
{"text":"Was optimistic but slowly faded! Poor service,  slow, super small servings.  $12.95 for the veggie hibachi and it was maybe a cup and a half of mixed veggies. Sushi ok, didn't taste all 5hat fresh.  Kept asking for plates, water ....not impressed."}
{"text":"Great food and prices! Food is served hibachi style or regular table/booth seating. I had the dinner bento box and enjoyed it from the onion soup and salad to the sushi and teriyaki chicken and tempura. 

The mango mochi ice cream was light but refreshing. The staff is extremely friendly and great explaining the menu."}
{"text":"Visited during lunch hour with family.  We expected a little better Japanese restaurant since I have been hearing a lot about this place from media.  

The place looks really like a Chinese restaurant.  And the food was ok in terms of the distance from oceans but no better than other Japanese restaurants in town.  The service was really good."}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing but the hibachi portions were so small in comparison for the price.  Go to ginza for hibachi!"}
{"text":"I'll start out by saying that the sushi was good, the rolls were on the small side but still good. The highland roll was great. That being said, the service we got was awful. We were told a 15-20 minute wait and that turned into an hour wait. It wasn't until I got up to ask about our table did a table magically appear. It was not particularly busy when we got there but it did by the time I asked about our table. Once we got our table the waitress kind of forgot about us too and didn't really check in on us after our food came. I went there for my birthday and got so frustrated I didn't want to stick around for another hour for dessert. It was a bad experience for my first time visiting."}
{"text":"I go to WI a couple times a year for training and have always looked forward to each trip, to try new cuisines.  Fuji I went back to twice!  

So they have the teppan grill if you want dinner and a show, but we have plenty of those in ABQ.  So I went the first trip for the sushi.  Because I was in Middleton and it also had mango on it, I ordered the Middleton Roll.  It's a shrimp tempura roll with mango. OMG.  FAB-YOU-LUST.  Hubs and I always gripe in ABQ sushi bars because, even when mango is plentiful, it's hard to find rolls (like Spicy Tuna Mango Rolls, for instance) on the menu.  But Fuji rocks the mango.  I also had coconut shrimp appetizer.  Very nice....oh and the Plum Sake Sangria (both times)...stop at one...two will make you stumble back to your hotel.  

Second visit, I went back...this time for the Hot Pot...a little sweet for my taste but otherwise very nicely done.  Meat was tender, veggies were plentiful.  The menu is huge on other options of Asian cuisine...so no matter what your taste buds crave, you can probably find something here for everyone in your party.

If I venture back, will have to do the Teppan grill to see if the chefs measure up to my standards of humor and skill.  But the sushi menu is my fave so far!"}
{"text":"Bright, as an obnoxiously bright with fake wood scape and some pond waterfall thing.  That was the first thing that hit me.  Second thing that I got hit with is the smell. It's not a bad smell as an wtf is that smell but rather they have really bad ventilation and your taking it home with you and then to the dry cleaners. After that I walked out.  Im sure the the food is ok since it's hard to mess up sushi but...."}
{"text":"Super fun and tranquil restaurant with hibachi grills!  The koi pond in the front entry is kept clean and allows you to see the beautiful fish swim.  The artwork throughout is well curated.  The small bar up front seats a few quests so I recommend getting a table for drinks and apps if the bar is somewhat busy.  The hibachi grill is comfy though a bit loud if you're looking to converse with those across the grill.  The hibachi host does their best to make it a fun and exciting experience by putting on a show using fire, cooking utensils, and commentary.  The sushi was absolutely amazing and the presentation was stellar.  Would visit again."}
{"text":"Came here for  lunch with friends.  super friendly staff.  Fun atmosphere.  They offer a hibachi side of the restaurant and a dining area.  We opted for the dining since we were just ordering sushi.
Everything tasted good and came up quickly.
Drinks were refilled regularly."}
{"text":"I would like to echo what Jeff said as I am assuming we had the same hibachi chef.  Everytime we go there we hope we don't have him although tonight unfortunately we did.  His name was \"han sum\". He thinks he is funny but is not with his racist political comments.  He beyond crosses the line with his inappropriate comments.  We had a 4 and 6 year old and were utterly embarrassed by him.  It is unfortunate because the food is great and my kids love going there. He calls your spouse your roommate and talks nonstop about the wall trump is building.  He didn't do a single trick for the kids and just seemed to mock everyone at the table.  We spoke with Kelvin the manager who apologized which is appreciated..just trying to answer questions from my kiddos about his comments.."}
{"text":"This restaurant is called Fuji Sushi & Hibachi. I know this because every single dish at the restaurant reminded me. Fuji is quite overzealous about its branding! 

My experience was fine. The service was fine, the ginger dressing on the garden salad was amazing, and the sushi was pretty good. It's a nice restaurant to visit, and the food isn't bad by any means, but I personally don't think Fuji's sushi outshines Sushi Muramoto's sushi.

Some people might find the decor at Fuji to be pleasing, but I personally find it quite gawdy.

Fuji probably won't make it on my list of favorite restaurants in Madison, but it's an okay place."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is really good. However the customer service from the manager 'Rebecca' was really bad. They made a mistake when I placed my order and charged me the difference to fix it. I hope it was worth it to get my extra few dollars to lose a customer :("}
{"text":"If you made it here.... Congrats !
The set up is awesome. All the decor felt nice and showed thought went into it. The colors were loud and live ;). They had booths, bar area, tables, private sections all that.
The service was awesome from the friendly wait staff to the funny hibachi chef walking around with his hat on fire being super entertaining. My table could not stop laughing at his jokes. Great energy was contiguous. Just mixed with ours and lol it spread to a night of laughter.

The sushi and hibachi dishes were awesome. I can't say anything but great things about the delcious sushi. The presentation and taste were superb! 
It's hard to believe the food could taste as fresh as it did considering this is located in Wisconsin but that explains why it took so long. They must have just killed the fish ;)

If you want sushi , pay this place a visit!

Enjoy the videos and pics ;). I hope they paint this experience even better than my words!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Would give five stars but they don't do the fire anymore at the hibachi grills and that breaks my heart so I had to take away a star...but the food and staff are both fabulous. Bring back the fire and I'll give you 5 stars"}
{"text":"Don't go for the sushi. Looked good but lacked flavor and the rice kept falling apart when trying to pick up the pieces. We went for a date night. We were seated very near the hibachi grills so it was very noisy. My opinion may have been better if we had been in a quieter section."}
{"text":"Chef was very entertaining.  We had a great time and will stop here when we get to Madison again."}
{"text":"It is a neat interior and good service. I tried the Bento box lunch. On the pricey side. I feel that VIP on Odana is a better place for the good and cost."}
{"text":"Tried out Fuji last night. I was happy to see that it was pretty busy since it just opened, seems like business is doing well. Overall we had a pleasant experience. There was a mistake with our sushi order and even though we said we would eat the roll that we were given by mistake, our server still asked the chef to make the correct roll for us. I was impressed by that. My only complaint was that I found the counter at the sushi bar to be sticky and the mat also was visibly dirty. The mats are a nice touch for the decor, but it seems it may make it harder to keep the sushi bar clean."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Where have you been all my life?

Our friends took us to Fuji recently for a Friday night dinner and my husband and I were crossing our fingers hoping this place wasn't 1) packed and 2) fantasmical (my words, never his). Definitely did not disappointment.

At 730pm, we didn't have to wait for a table and seated right away. Our server (can't remember his name) was friendly, engaging, and comedic. The overall atmosphere was busy, but never once did we feel like we had to grab his attention for even something as basic as water refills. He was on top of his game. 

As for the food, it was amazing. My husband and I love VIP asian cuisine over on Odana Rd. and we had a lengthy conversation in the car afterwards about how Fuji has probably topped our sushi list. We ordered the Black Dragon roll, Fuji roll, and Chicken Tempura meal. The rolls had plenty of eel and the flavors were perfect. The chicken tempura plate was plentiful. My husband looked overwhelmed with the size, but no food is really safe with him. We saved some of it and brought it home for a snack. The soup and salad that it came with was typical, so nothing to write home about.  We also tried the Sunny roll from our friends' plate and that was a really light and fresh sushi roll wrapped in soy paper. We can't wait to come back again for more!"}
{"text":"I recently ate at Fuji because of the 4 star Yelp rating. I was pretty disappointed. 

When I arrived I noticed that the environment was well planned but that was about where my enjoyment ended. 

My waitress came over and it was immediately clear that she didn't speak English very well. I asked her what beer they had on tap and she replied with Root Beer. Not quite. After trying to communicate for some time, I finally had to pantomime the motion of a tap. She informed me that they didn't have beer on tap. (Bummer)

Next I tried to order food. I was hoping to see a nice bluefin or fatty tuna on the Nigiri menu but all I saw as an option was Tuna. 

So I turned my attention to the rolls. I have food allergies to wheat and eggs meaning I can't have tempura or mayo. It was interesting to me that almost every roll contained one of those two things. To me, that means that their fish must not be of the highest quality. 

I did finally find a tuna plate special that came with three types of Nigiri and a tuna roll. Unfortunately the roll had tempura flakes and mayo on it. However, I'm usually extremely successful with modifying sushi rolls so I forged ahead. 

I asked my waitress if she could make the necessary modifications to the roll. She said she couldn't because it was \"pre mixed\". Even the tempura. That's kind of gross. And are the rolls already made? Because otherwise they could have just not used the mix...

Anyway I finally said, just bring me a tuna and avocado roll instead. Which she got. 

When my food arrived, the plate smelled overly like bathroom cleaner and the sushi was so bad that I couldn't finish it. 

To top it off, flagging my server down for anything was near impossible. 

I sincerely don't understand the 4 and 5 star ratings. Must be from people who either just ate Hibachi or rarely eat sushi. 

This place isn't much less expensive than Sushi Muramoto and Sushi Muramoto would win on sushi taste and quality 10x over. 

If you love sushi, be warned."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place last Friday as Muramoto had a 45 min wait for take out (?!?!) As soon as I walked in the door, I knew it was a mistake.  The decor was super cheesy, seemingly mostly geared toward hibachi.  It's prob great for kids, but I get nervous about eating sushi in a mid continent state and this place did nothing to ease my fears!  On to the sushi- it was fine.  That's it- not good or bad.  Pretty blah and plain.  I don't think I'll come back unless maybe for hibachi- but my clothes smelled for days!"}
{"text":"Very good with attentive friendly service! We elected to sit in the dining room rather than at a hibachi table for a late lunch. All the hibachi choices were very good...they ask how you want your steak cooked & it comes out as ordered. The bento box was also quite tasty. Drinks kept filled, and our waitress had a lovely smile always.  The aroma of the hibachi tables as we were leaving made us want to stand around the table and breathe in the goodness. Great choice for lunch!"}
{"text":"Our sushi and bento box was delicious!  We had the fire rolls and teriyaki chicken bento box! The bento box was huge and included lots of good! We eat at a booth, but next time will definitely do the hibachi grill! It looked so entertaining from a distance! Also, the interior decor was so beautiful!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty and seems to offer a lot  and the staff is good. I come for the sushi and I haven't had the hibachi. The sushi is really beautiful and a flower (orchid I think) on every plate so beautiful. You can sit at the sushi bar or a big booth. I prefer to sit right by the sushi bar there can be kind of an intense smell by the hibachi. Tons of drinks on their menu, many items something for everyone. A lot of their specialty rolls is mostly shrimp tempura, tuna and crab but whatever I enjoyed everything I have had here. So I usually get tuna and salmon sushi. My last visit I had the fire island, sunny roll, spicy lovers roll which was a special isn't always on the menu. All super delicious I love like the combination with the spicy mayo on top"}
{"text":"The worst Asian food in the area. We had soba, udon and sushi. The soba was over cooked, the seafood in my soup was over cooked. My husband had udon, but it was spaghetti. Then sushi was ugly and warm. We are not coming back again."}
{"text":"We walked up to the restaurant and declared for all to hear that we were ready to be disappointed!  Only because restaurants like this seem to always end up being a gamble and you really feel like you've lost the bet if it's a on the higher end of the price scale.

I'm happy to report this wasn't the case.  We were given the option of a seat at a hibachi table, booth or sushi bar and chose hibachi because we had checked out the menu ahead of time and both wanted hibachi meals.

There was one other party in the room with the hibachi grills and their table was full so we got seated at an empty table wondering if it would be just us.  Shortly thereafter we were joined by a couple and then another couple making it six total.  Because of the timing of when the other couples joined us we were wondering how it was going to all shake out.  We had already placed our order and received our sushi before the first of the two couples arrived.  The waiter apologized to us since we were now waiting on the other two couples to first choose a drink then an entree.  We certainly didn't mind.  Unlike a post work weekday eat-out we weren't in a hurry to get in and out.  However we felt the waiter did push the other two couples to quickly choose their meals likely because of wanting to make sure we were happy.  They still opted to take their time which was certainly fine with us.

I chose the dragon roll for my sushi entree because unlike most of the rolls it didn't contain mayo.  Since when is mayo a staple of sushi?  Anyway, the sushi roll was good, but not great.  Not very impressive looking and it wasn't a party in my mouth or anything.

We got the standard mushroom broth soup and small salad prior to the hibachi chef arriving and both were very good, likely in part because we were both starving.

For dinner I ordered the hibachi vegetables and hubby got the filet.  People commented here that the vegetable entree was small, but it was the right size for me.  I included a picture of the portion because of previous reviews.  Hubby was pleased with his quantity of steak but would have liked more vegetables for himself.  My vegetables were cooked well and very flavorful.  The vegetable hibachi meal wasn't supposed to include the two shrimp appetizer that all hibachi meals receive, but it was offered to me and I took it.

Like other hibachi restaurants, this would not be the place to go if you have food allergy concerns or you are a strict vegetarian.  The fried rice, which was delicious, was full of eggs and the steak and vegetables were cooked in close proximity to each other.  However, different serving utensils were used for first, the raw meats, and then once they were fully cooked.

No bean sprouts, like Ginza does, were served at the end of the meal which was just fine with us.  We'll be back and next time I'll choose a different sushi roll or skip it all together.  Probably didn't need the additional calories anyway."}
{"text":"We've been shying away from Fuji because it seemed like a chain....that was a very stupid decision.

My husband and I came on a Friday around 5:30 and got seated immediately on the patio. While walking through the restaurant, we both noted the decor was awesome, and that we'd have to come back for a chance to eat inside. Our server was attentive and kind, and pretty knowledgable about the menu considering it was his 5th day in Madison!

We got the Goyoza appetizer (DELICIOUS!) and split two special rolls. My husband got the crawfish roll and I don't remember the name of mine, but it was absolutely phenominal. Prices were fair, and beer prices were great (hellooo 4$ spotted cow!)

There were a lot of rolls on the menu that we will be back to try! Great find in Middleton!"}
{"text":"Went for my moms 60th birthday and had a blast. The wait was a little longer than I would have liked but well worth the wait. The hibachi chef put on a great show and made my mom feel extra special. The soup was tasty and the tempura shrimp appetizer was fantastic but expensive for only getting two pieces.  

Our group ordered, lobster, filet mignon, shrimp and the kids steak hibachi. The filet mignon melted in your mouth, and the shrimp was delicious. The lobster was a little salty but still really good. Dishes were also served with fried rice and vegetables which were also really good. 

If it's your birthday the staff gives you ice cream as well as sings you a fun birthday song! Highly recommend coming with a group of friends or family. Tables seat 10.

One downfall is they do not take reservations on the weekends."}
{"text":"Fuji has always been a favorite until the final straw today. I order sashimi and I request my California roll with soy paper rather than rice. The chef not only exclaimed his disappointment in my order but the waitress- as she hands me my salad- actually tells me that the chef finds my order \"too hard\" and in the future not to order it. Why is your chefs lack of training and generally crappy attitude my fault? And why am I paying extra for it if you're going to complain about it anyway? Why are you making me feel bad about my order? Will not be patronizing this location anymore, which is a shame Considering the frequency myself and coworkers visited- who were also present when this happened."}
{"text":"Kudos to Fuji to buck the trend of open format dining rooms with natural lighting. Instead, they took a wide open space and compartmentalized it adding faux waterfalls, faux timbers, a sushi bar, a regular bar, dining room and a separate hibachi room all under one roof.  A literal maze with blue, green, and red lit ceilings. I simply don't understand it.
Menuwise, Fuji has your standard offerings-appetizers, rolls, sushi, sashimi, as well as a few entrees.  We opted for goyza, the sushi appetizer, yellowtail roll and a tuna specialty roll.  The rolls were well made and the sushi was cut well.  The specialty toll, Crazy Tuna, needed something more as the \"crunch\" that it was advertised with was missing.  Service was attentive although a little confusing as our waitress came to our table talking into her microphone (they all wear earpieces) and we thought she was addressing the table.
While the food was ok, the whole experience came off as gimmicky-from the decor to the chef walking around with the top of his hat on fire (at least I hope it was a gimmick!).  Just a strange experience overall."}
{"text":"There are a couple big reasons reason Fuji is not receiving 5 stars. 
-First the place is really smokey from the grills. The ventilation is atrocious. 
-Second Fuji is loud, I mean very loud! You can not have a conversation the chefs are loud, the grills are loud, everything is loud.

Why it received 4 stars.
- The food was absolutely delicious. (My Teriyaki chicken bento box could have use less sauce teriyaki sauce but I could scrape it off.)
- My 9 year old had a perfect portion of honey shrimp, which came with a side of rice and soup, and loved it. 
- The staff sang a birthday song for my 9 year old.
-  fuji's menu had chicken nuggets and fries on it for little picky eaters.
- And our dinner service was very fast."}
{"text":"I have never had such fast service and tasty sushi at any other location! I love this restaurant and I now come here at least once a week! I love the salmon roll, Alaskan salmon roll, smoked salmon roll, and rainbow roll! Everything is so fresh and I usually don't even have time to finish my miso soup before my meal comes out! This place is the best and I hope it stays open for many many years to come! You won't be disappointed! The decor is lovely and you can take a peek at the water feature while you're waiting. The staff is so friendly and always refilling drinks before you even need to ask. Best sushi at a great price!"}
{"text":"Good, fresh sushi. Sake is very reasonably priced. Hasn't been busy any time that I have been."}
{"text":"Decent food, mediocre atmosphere, and inattentive, appalling service.

We sat at the bar to have drinks and a bit of food.  Including ourselves, there were a total of four people seated at the bar.  

Not once did the bartender (get a proper fitting shirt and tuck it in, by the way) ask us if we'd like to order a drink - we had to solicit his attention twice to get drinks.  His attitude was short and terse.

A poor start to the evening, but what really set us off is this: while we waited to even be asked if we'd like to order a drink, the team captain, Kevin, helped himself to a beer right in front of us (and continued to drink throughout our visit).

When we tried to order food - straight off the menu, no special requests - the bartender looked at us bewildered and frustrated and explained this isn't his gig.  Finally, he got a server to punch in the order.  

The food was decent.  We had an appetizer, a few pieces of sushi nigiri, a standard sushi roll and a special roll.  

While we ate, the bartender complained about other guests and decided to have dinner and a drink at the bar, right in front of us.

It's pretty clear the management here couldn't care less about prompt, courteous, and professional service.  To let staff eat and drink in front of paying customers is simply inexcusable."}
{"text":"Had to create a yelp account to express my terrible experience at fuji. This was my third time at fuji, the previous times all great experience. This time was a HUGE experience. Waited 1.5 hours to get served hibachi. The manager Kelvin hid from our party as we waited for our chef to arrive. He finally arrived and I went to find the manager to express my displeasure. He took ten dollars off my overall bill. Extremely disappointed and will not return."}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights

1) friendly service
2) ambiance leaves something to be desired
3) gluten free friendly

Visited Fuji on a Tuesday night with no reservation hoping to do hibachi! We only had to wait about 5 mins for a few spots at the hibachi table to clear up before we could sit down. Fuji is pretty new, and the exterior looks new/modern but the inside is quite different. The ambiance is kind of tacky and looks like it is from the 80's, not 2016! 

The service is VERY friendly and goes above and beyond to make sure you are having a great time. Our server asked about food allergies and upon learning that I had a wheat allergy, explained that the hibachi is actually not gluten free. No worries though! He simply sent my order to the back kitchen to be prepared separately. I thought it was nice of him to ask and provide an alternate option.

The price is reasonable for hibachi given how much food you get. But the food is really just ok, nothing to write home about. 

There were a few birthdays the night we were there. The staff sings and plays a drum so it's get pretty loud! Fuji probably isn't a place I would go for a quiet night out. 

We had a fun time, but we probably won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"The specialty sushi rolls were good and the price is great compared to other similar rolls..... BUT I got sick a couple hours later and remained sick the rest of the day.  Unfortunately the sushi seems to be the only possible cause."}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious- the best we've ever had. The restaurant was clean and beautiful. Our experience would have been 5 stars however, the bartender was so obnoxious! He kept repeating himself loudly, singing, dancing around, and taking shots! It was very disrespectful to the patrons. (We visited 2/22/2018)"}
{"text":"Great special rolls. Nice service as general. 
However: we order \"grilled tuna\" - rare.....we make sure the server understand...and - the tuna arrives \"done\" to \"well done\". 
No one ever should serve tuna that cocked medium or over. It is not ok. And for sure it is not ok for the server to argue with us if it's \"rare or not\" - especially when it was \"burn to death\""}
{"text":"Service was good as was the salad. Sadly, the Hibachi vegetables were mushy and the sushi had very little flavor."}
{"text":"We had a blast at habatchi. Gil was our chef and if you can request him.. Do it. He's funny, engaging, and a great chef. We went with friends, and got something different. Sea bass, scallops and shrimp, chicken, and just shrimp. We also had a side of sushi. The fish was sliced perfectly and extremely tasty. We heard a few birthday party songs from other tables.. I almost faked it was my birthday just to get the cool little fire flower they give you.. 

Prices vary but habatchi is on the pricey side. $22-$45 depending on what you get. Worth it for the scallops and sea bass. 

We will all be back for sushi at some point!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a Hibachi dinner and some entertainment and I really wanted to like the place but I was let down, especially for the price. Our party of four all go a Hibachi style dinner and a couple rolls were split as appetizers. The soup and salads were okay and steak and and shrimp were good, but the Hibachi skills of our chef were lacking. It was late in the night and said he was new so I am hoping he finds his way. But I have some badass knife skills and can show him up and that was the main reason I was there. The filet mignon was good but I was going for steak I would have gone to a steak house.

The ambiance was nice, the hosts were accomodating, and the Hibachi chef was fun and friendly, just not the tricks and moves that I am used to."}
{"text":"Blue Crab Roll is good, but at the same time unlike any blue crab roll I've ever had. Tempura, way over done. Fried calamari, way over done. Lighten up the batter and drop some of the fry time. I'd go back, but just for a roll or two."}
{"text":"Clean, nicely lit, fresh tasting seafood, responsive service, and really good sushi.  Pricey, and the hibachi seemed overpriced compared to what we got, but the quality was apparent."}
{"text":"I can't see myself going back to this place unless someone drags me.  If you want an ok meal and the loudest and most obnoxious place to dine,  then this is the place for you.  My husband and I went on a Friday night and between the loud drum banging, yelling and singing, we could hardly hear each other talk.  We were on the opposite side of the room from the Hibachi grills but the odors stuck to our clothing and hair so badly  that we had comments later of people asking us where we had been.  The décor is gaudy as well.  So much for Japanese zen...."}
{"text":"Seems like they put more emphasis on their decor than food. Right when you walk in you see great decoration, beautiful setup and intimate setting. One side is hibachi and the other is sushi dining. I went for sushi and was seated in a nice tall booth, very cozy. The menu was large with lots to choose from including non-sushi items. Price range was the usual and Sunday is dinner price/portion all day. We placed our order and after that rolled in the disappointment. 

Beef negimaki bento box came with soup and salad. But the salad was soaked in thousand island dressing served with super hard croutons. The mushroom soup was flavored with lots of sodium. Not much to it, it was pretty much broth. 

It took long for the rest of the food to come out which was two special sushi rolls. We started to share the bento box because I didn't want my friend to wait for the rolls to begin eating, the food was going to get cold. Finally the sushi rolls came out. The bento box was near complete. And I don't know why most sushi joints I've experience tend to always bring the bento box way before the sushi rolls, but this wait took way too long.

And the wait wasn't worth it. This place lacks a lot in flavor. They seems to be heavy on the sweet or salty side. The sushi rolls even though had multiple ingredients had one flat note to them, no excitement whatsoever. Their wasabi and ginger had no bite. Even the soy sauce had a weird smell and taste to it.

I am not sure I'll be back a second time."}
{"text":"First, let me say that Chef Dang and his brother were too very funny gentlemen! Chef Dang was such a great Chef! The food was really good and the service was excellent! We will most definitely return! A must try for date night or any night for that matter!"}
{"text":"I only want to echo the review below by Ceri I think we had the same chef a few nights ago.. he thinks he is funny.. apparently from what he said he previously worked at a comedy club... Maybe that's why it was previous as he is not funny.. his racist comments were totally not welcome and were nonstop

I love the food and atmosphere normally and will go back but sure hope he is not my chef again"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the weird looking blonde guy behind the bar was quite strange. He was in the parking lot, smoking, when we arrived and he starred at my fiance and as we entered, he then followed us in. We sat on the sushi bar side, this guy was the bartender. He continued to stare at me, very noticeable by myself and my wife. He also made it a point to walk past our table several times, for no apparent reason. When we were finished and leaving, he followed us out, got in his car and left."}
{"text":"Had a great and entertaining lunch. We had Han Solo as our hibachi chef, and he was amazing! Will certainly go back again."}
{"text":"The Hibachi Teppanyaki chef was a blast & I enjoyed lunch with a group of co-workers. When I returned for a sushi dinner I was not impressed. Limited selection of sushi, especially for someone like my husband who is gluten free and allergic to shrimp. It was loud, overpriced and the service wasn't great."}
{"text":"Let's talk about how much I love coming here. A ton. Like a lot a lot. Argue with me all you want, but it's hands down the best hibachi in town. 

Whenever we go, the first thing I'm asked if if either of us have any food allergies. That alone would get them 2 stars, even if every other aspect was awful consistently. Luckily for all of us here, it's great every time. 

Servers are amazing, and the hibachi chefs always have been upbeat, even if it's just me and my husband at the table. They give 100% effort if your party is 2 or 6, and that's hard to find. We've been to other places where they'll just phone in the whole act. 

The filet mignon is so good. It's never tough and I've yet to have them cook it poorly. 

The sushi is fresh and reasonably priced. We don't always order it, so I can't gush about it like the hibachi. 

Service has always been friendly and prompt. I can get 3 or 4 refills at the same meal, in great time if I need it."}
{"text":"Oof! A 2nd trip back with other friends who came into town was less positive. I don't want to unfairly bring it down to 2 because we did have a very positive experience before but it did chip away at my opinion.

For starters -- we came to the bar and it was busy but we sat there for 15 minutes without being asked for a drink order all the while newcomers would be asked for theirs. That's a HUGE red flag.

It became very apparent that half of the restaurant was filled by an office party but the focus of the wait staff was almost 100% on that party.

Unfortunately it caused the rest of our experience to suffer. We wound up leaving the bar without ordering because we were never approached despite being one of the only ones actually *at* the bar. 

Our friends arrived and we sat down for hibachi and we had a rather lackluster / inept chef who did his best to do the usual tricks but consistently failed. Perhaps he was new -- and that's forgivable (again -- I don't want to go down to 2 -- it may have just been a perfect storm).

Ultimately -- for the price -- I'll probably give it one more shot which'll be the \"make or break\" for me. Their hibachi is expensive and if the service and performance doesn't meet the price -- we'll definitely be looking for an alternate \"fun hibachi\" site in the Madison area."}
{"text":"This place is so clean and modern looking, and more spacious than a normal hibachi restaurant.....however our cook acted like he was in a rush to finish with us quickly and we went during a time when not many people were there at all. If it wasn't for that I would have gave it a 5.

I tried to respond to a comment left by REBECCA P. From Fuji but I could not figure it out so I'll just edit my review. I had the hibachi chicken and teriyaki salmon. Soooo good. Like I said everything was great except for the customer service. I do have a suggestion.....Ginza of Tokyo has closed and they were the only hibachi restaurant that offered kogane and garlic options....maybe you guys could offer those?"}
{"text":"Nice place, but food was just OK.  The restaurant itself was very nice.  Everything was new, clean, well lit and open.  We ate at a hibachi table.  Our chef did almost no \"show\".  We saw other chefs doing fun things, but ours did nothing.  He was nice and friendly, but you eat at a hibachi table for the show.  The food wasn't bad, it was just OK.  Everything tasted the same.  Everything was cooked in the exact same sauce (which didn't even have much flavor), the vegetables,  the shrimp,  the chicken,  the steak all the same.  Made for a very bland dinner."}
{"text":"I wasn't crazy about this place at all. Poor wine list. Drinks are cheap and sugary. I thought it was going to be a high end sushi place but it isn't. Sushi is so so. Overall it has a cheap feel. Better places to go in Madison."}
{"text":"The staff Was great very warm and accommodating. Tia was our server and chef Dang was our cook at the Hibachi grill. Both made sure we were having fun and the food was wonderful cooked to perfection.  Loved the food, the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant. I will defiantly return! If you haven't been yet I highly recommend it. A must visit."}
{"text":"Not fantastic, but not bad either. If you're in the mood for Hibachi Style Japanese food this the place to go to.  In fact, it's the only place to go in the area. 

I had the filet mignon and shrimp combo. Again, the food was pretty good but the  host, wait staff and chef made it very good. 

When I'm back and definitely in the mood for Hibachi, I'd come back here."}
{"text":"I'm not a sea food person but like Hibachis. I came here with my family for the first time and brought friends with us who have never tried a Hibachi before. This place was not disappointing. The chef was a funny and skilled guy who made excellent food for us. Everyone was happy and had a great time.

The only suggestion I have is that the beer should be much colder than it was. Otherwise, everything was very good."}
{"text":"Had dinner at the new Fuji Sushi at Greenway tonight.  LOVED it!  Chef was good and entertaining.  Restaurant is clean, bright and beautifully decorated.  The food was delicious.  I am sure that Ginza will either need to completely remodel/deep clean or go out of business.  Sushi was very good as well!  Only thing keeping it from 4 stars was that server was not as attentive.  Long wait between drinks and getting the check.

Items ordered were: Tuna Avocado Salad, Middleton Roll, Spicy Tuna with crab roll, Hibachi Shrimp, Hibachi Steak, and kids Hibachi Steak & Chicken."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for his place a year ago and now finally, it's opened!
There are two parts of the place, one is the Japanese restaurant and the other is the hibachi grill. 
For the Japanese restaurant, nothing special, but they do come in big portions. Tried the udon and regular entrees, tasted good.
For the hibachi grill, I would say it's more entertaining then having dinner. The steak tasted great. But the food was too salty for me. Still a nice experience though."}
{"text":"Our first experience here was awesome! The food was great and our chef Han Solo was amazing! Very funny and a great showman! All the staff was very friendly and polite and we are looking forward too a return visit soon!"}
{"text":"Saturday's can get very busy and crowded at Fuji since they do not do reservations. I was so surprised on how well the young host handled the evening, he was super nice and patient with everyone, even though it was super busy and customers where complaining about the wait for the Hibachi. I felt welcome at the restaurant. All of the staff are very polite and I'm definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"I've tried 3 or 4 other sushi places but always come back to this one. The rolls are always great and fresh. Service can be a little slow but they're always very friendly."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! We have gotten both the hibachi and the sushi boat, and we've never been disappointed. The staff is friendly, we've never had to wait long, and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Fuji killed it.  My wife and I were eager to try this place as we both love Hibachi and Sushi, and the buzz had been growing for this new spot.  Took a trip over there on a Tuesday night around 6:30pm and were seated right away.

Love the style of the place - bright, colorful, modern, lots of decorations, and a fun Hibachi area that keeps the tables close and social.  This is the first thing that really stuck out to me, as I've been to quite a few different Hibachi restaurants and many of them feel pretty sterile, or like in Ginza's case, run down.  It's a shame because I rarely get a bad meal at any of those spots, but good atmosphere is not a given.

The service matched the décor.  Our waitress was very friendly and good about bringing out drinks on time, answering questions, and having a general good sense of things.  It was also nice that they seat you and start the meal process as you get there, unlike many places where you need a full table first.  We still waited for the table to fill up to get the main courses going, but at least here you get your soup and salad ahead of time.  Speaking of those, the salad was nice, a good flavor and I'm not normally a salad guy.  The soup was luke warm and a little too sour for me, but I'm sure it was just timing.

But then Chef Han (or Han Solo as he put it lol) rolled in.  This guy was awesome.  Put on one of the best shows I've seen, doing all the usual tricks and plus a whole ton more.  He walks in with fire coming out of his hat, and I knew at that point this meal was about to get real.  Dude proceeds to go ape on the knives, fire everywhere, and talks to everyone at the table throughout the meal.  He had my wife come up and bounce the eggs, made all of us laugh a lot, and literally lit his hands on fire.   That's 'effin service.  Don't want to spoil all of his show so I'll stop there, but he was a cool chef and really entertaining.  He talked a bit about his past when I asked, and he's been through a long windy experience leading up to this point.  Absolutely request him if he's around.

The food was good.  Not the best Hibachi I've had but very tasty and I absolutely will return because of the experience and also some custom tailoring that our chef mentioned a lot of them do (7  Japanese spice filet mmmmhmm).  The main thing with the food was that I felt the fried rice was a little bland and soggy (but again still good), otherwise everything else is hot to trot including the delicious shrimp and accompanying oil/sauce.  The vegetables were on point, super great to see Broccoli in the mix as I'm a big fan and it was wonderful with the mustard sauce.

Pretty sure I will be back soon and won't be visiting the other Hibachi joints anytime in the near future.  Next time I want to bring a cadre of friends though, and get their birthday drums going.  

Keep up the fire Fuji"}
{"text":"A little pricy, but sushi usually is. Not the best I've ever had but certainly good sushi. The wait staff was very nice and attentive. The jumbo saki is basically the same size as the small. I would go here again, but I'm not a sushi fanatic, so maybe I'm not the best person to ask."}
{"text":"What a great experience. Our hibachi chef - Shine was amazing.  He was so much fun. The food was great, the chef was so entertaining and the wait staff were excellent as well. This was our first time here and it was such a treat. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love stopping into this place! The staff are always friendly, the sushi bar is perfect for someone who just wants to enjoy time to themselves as I do. I love the green tea and my waitress was happy to tell me exactly what kind of green tea it is so I could get my own for home. 

I've been here many times, on my own and on lunch dates and have always had a great experience. The sushi is great, one time at the sushi bar alone the sushi chief gave me a seaweed salad and it was delicious! Never been a big hibachi fan, but watching in from my tables there it always looked fun."}
{"text":"They don't honor the 10% off coupon on their website unless you print it. How last century is that!!  Sushi is good, Hibachi is ok and really depends on the chef if you're looking for entertainment. Some great and others not so great."}
{"text":"Eek...with some great local sushi spots within 10 minutes of here...we just can't go back.  Sushi is squishy and ingredients are not seemingly fresh.  Prices are affordable, may be an OK spot for a sushi newbie but if you love sushi it's worth the drive to go to Muramoto at Hilldale."}
{"text":"This place is great!! Went there last night for the second time. Both visits I've done the hibachi. When we arrived, it was buzzing with business, yet we had very little wait to be seated. 

We were seated at a table that already almost full, we took the last 4 spots. They were a party of 6ish, and then us. So just two groups. The waitress came and took our drink orders quickly and just a few minutes later all of our soups and salads were being served. 

The soup is delish, and the mushrooms are large enough that I can easily remove them (I don't do mushrooms!). The salad is SO good. It has a ginger dressing on it that is just wonderful. I have had other versions of this ginger dressing at other hibachi places, this is the best I've had yet. 

Our chef came out while we were all still munching on our salads and started the show. He was hilarious! Charismatic, funny, attentive, and very entertaining! 

He cooked up several meats for the table, shrimp, chicken, steak, filet mignon. I personally only had the filet mignon in my dish. Normally I opt for combo-meals with two meats, but I am SO glad I didn't. The filet mignon was so perfect. It was cooked exactly as ordered, melted in my mouth, and was so flavorful. I felt bad for all the saps who just ordered the steak. It is SO worth the slightly higher price to get the mignon. 

When everyone was finished, the waitress, along with several other waitstaff, brought out two birthday plates for the table - one for me, and one for one of the folks in the other party. Someone had been sneaky and told them we were celebrating! They sang us a birthday song in Japanese, and then did a second verse in English so everyone could sing. It was great! 

Overall I was very happy with the whole experience. The atmosphere was great, the food was better than great, and the restaurant itself was tastefully decorated and very modern and fun. I will be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"We got seated in the patio area. We were the only ones in the patio area so they forgot us. Had to go remind them that we were seated 15 minutes ago. 

We did not order any food. Not coming back!"}
{"text":"Disclosure:  we ate sushi not hibachi.   Blue green sauce drizzled on sushi.  Seriously, looked like watered down toothpaste.  Troubling...  also very small portions of everything.  Crab Rangoon: mediocre and tiny.   Miso Soup was room temp. Seaweed salad was okay but very small.  

Positives:  excellent energy to the place. The server was fast and very good with kids. That's why this wasn't one star.

I'm still blown away that turquoise colored sauce can be served over raw fish."}
