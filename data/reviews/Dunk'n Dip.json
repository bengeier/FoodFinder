{"text":"Such a cute little place! If anything, I'd say they need to make it bigger due to customer demand. 

I went with three girlfriends and I got A Piece of Heaven which comes as a skewer of fruit, marshmellow, and a brownie (yum!) and your choice of dark, milk, white, or caramel chocolate dip. It was super yummy and I wish it didn't have to end!

They also offered macarons and gelato, as well as coffee and tea, which can be sold to the public in little boxes. The front counter had glass jars hanging above it filled with candies, chocolates, and marshmallows. The seats were very comfy and the space was sufficient, with a small library stacked with cookbooks and inspirational books separating our table from the one beside us. 

I think the only downside are the prices. They're not too bad, don't get me wrong, but for the portions you get, I would've hoped for a lower price. The portion I got (picture included) was a little under $10 with tax. 

Overall, I loved it and would recommended trying it out :)"}
{"text":"I got the surprise me crepe. One of the crepes had banana and kiwi, another had brownies and custard,  and the third had strawberry and custard. In my opinion,  the brownie custard was overwhelmingly sweet,  and I had to mix some strawberries in it to diffuse the sweetness. The chocolate shot is also a bit much, so I only had a bit of it. Perhaps I will order dark chocolate next time (I ordered milk chocolate and white chocolate).  The wait was a bit long, and they have a sitting area upstairs which is nice but random at the same time as it is a bunch of people waiting restlessly on couches. It's overpriced, but overall it was a good dessert experience."}
{"text":"Impeccable service here at the dunk n' dip.
I took a friend here for her birthday and we hadn't had even mentioned to anyone that it was her birthday yet the guest violinist had somehow overheard me greet her and come up to us asking her to choose one song from his playlist and he would play it especially for her. Not only did he play John Legend's \"All of me\" which we LOVED they even had a server bring out some complimentary sweet treats for her. Coffee here was great and so was the eclair on the stick that I had ordered. We also had some gelato as well which was so soft and creamy. Will definitely be coming back to this great restaurant to satisfy our sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"I don't think you can really go wrong with Dunk n Dip! My sister and I finally went there to check it out. The decor was super cute inside the restaurant! Definitely somewhere you would go on a special date. I had the Cafe Mocha, and I have to say it is the best I've ever had! It was really rich in its chocolate flavour and the underlying coffee flavour was perfect as well. 

My sister had the hot chocolate and I'm not sure which one it was specifically, but she loved it! We both had the waffle burger, which was kind of different since its a burger in a waffle -- never had that before. We got tons of home fries with it that neither of us could finish it. We both would definitely return! 

Great experience."}
{"text":"After seeing an enormous amount of amazing pictures and hearing people rave about how amazing the place is, my friends and I thought we would go check it out. I made sure to call in the morning to make reservations as people suggested here, however, the lady on the phone said they only make reservations for at least 10 people while laughing :| (not sure whats funny lol) When we arrived it was pretty empty which was amazing. I think the food was okay... it was great at the moment but because of how big the proportion was (with a high price obviously) i felt pretty sick after.. the service was great but they were SLOW. They were not noticing customers at all and were standing there smiling (what...)
anyways... would go there again but only for special occasions and not all the time."}
{"text":"Soo I don't normally leave reviews but I feel like this one needs to be done. In my short 25 years on earth this is easily the best dessert place I've been to! The atmosphere is awesome with the bright lighting and fun decor. I had \"A night to remember\" which is cinnamon coated apples on 3 waffles I had it with white chocolate. Rarely would I repeat a meal from somewhere unless I thoroughly enjoyed it.......and let me tell you, I'd probably get this every night if it was feasible.  I also tried a bit of our groups orders which were \"too much not enough\", \"simple joy\" and \"fruit on a stick\". The main commonality between all of them was that although everything is sweet it's not so rich that it makes you feel sick half way through. They were all perfect with respect to flavor definitely not too sweet. And fruits were all fresh and ripe! Overall awesome place I'll definitely be back again in the very near future."}
{"text":"Awesome place for desserts. Cheesecake was really good !!! Will Def come again. Server was quite helpful it also helps that their cakes and cheesecakes don't have any gelatin in them."}
{"text":"This place is adorable and their desserts (and savoury items) are yummy. Everything I've tried here has been heavenly. It is pricier than its competitors but I'd say Dunk'n Dip offers better quality items. I've meaning to try their fondue."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to do desserts on Sunday night, and we wanted to try The Apricot Tree, but who knew? They are closed on Sundays! (Booooo...)

I brought my friend to Dunk'n Dip instead. I wish I did not have any reason to update my review so soon, but the service on Sunday night was incredibly slow, we constantly felt forgotten, and it was just not the same experience I had two weeks ago.

Surprisingly, at 7 o'clock on Sunday night, it was a full house. We waited about 10 minutes for a table to free up. We sat down and waited another 5 to 10 minutes before we got the menus and a lamp, which you light up to indicate that you are ready to order. However, that was not effective at all because our server did not pay any attention to it. We basically waited and waited until she finally looked our way.

We ordered a Snow White to share, and we wanted to add a scoop of gelato. We asked how a junior scoop compares to a jumbo scoop. As if we weren't able to figure it out already, she responded by telling us, \"A junior is small and a jumbo is big.\" It left us speechless... Anyways! We went with a junior scoop of salted caramel gelato just to try and it complemented the waffles very nicely. I wish the waffles were a lot crispier though! The presentation of this dessert was a hot mess... Their signature crepe looked a lot more appealing. 

My friend asked for water when we placed our order but it never came. Halfway through our dessert, she had to ask a second time. Meanwhile, we noticed the table beside us wanted water as well, but they only received two glasses with ice, but no jug of water.

When it came to getting the bill, again, it took a while before we got our server's attention. As we chatted away, 15 minutes went by, and still no bill. We managed to get another server's attention. She apologized for the long wait and in the end, she was the one who gave us our bill. 

Perhaps our server was new, but...she seemed like she lacked training. She constantly forgot our requests, and it was quite frustrating for the both of us."}
{"text":"Their menu offers more variety than expected. I had a steak sandwich (3 waffles, steak, lettuce, tomato, pickles and sauce) served with homemade potatoes. The potatoes were like hash browns. The meal was delicious. My steak was very tender and the ingredients were all fresh. I would have ordered dessert but the meal portion was more than ample. I ordered a cappuccino and it was huge with lots of frothy milk. 
The bathroom was clean and well stocked with items such as toothpicks, hand towels and seat covers."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Management doesn't care about customer service, hostess had some attitude, no one picks up the phone, when we finally sat no one came over to offer us water. We stood up and left within 10 minutes of sitting down, hostess didn't even say anything when we passed by her on our way out."}
{"text":"Chocolate everywhere! Dark, milk and white chocolate!
Dip pretty much anything you want in your choice of chocolate, ranging from fresh fruit to cheesecake!
The waffle sticks were amazing! Fresh, soft waffles!
A must try!"}
{"text":"You have to really really need chocolate to tolerate the service in this cafe. We came in on saturday night, ignored for 5minutes and i had to flag someone down to ask if we could sit down.  We were sent to a dirty table, the previous customers dishes still there.  After 15 minutes, no one yet came to clean the table,let alone acknowledge us, so i went to the counter to ask the same girl who directed us to the dirty table to please come take away the dirty dishes at least, and i picked up 2 menus myself on the way back to the table.  Waited another 15 minutes.  Still nothing, so we got up and left, taking our business elsewhere.  This experience left me queasy at best.  If they neglect customers and dirty tables and dishes like this, i can only imagine the neglect that goes on where we cant see it. Port Credit hosts a number of lovely places to go out to on a saturday night, dont bother with DunknDip."}
{"text":"This place isn't worth the hype.  It was jammed packed busy, so I can see that the local mostly early 20 somethings spending daddy's money like it.  The average age in here, fully packed, was probably 22.  We decided to give it a go anyway.  The food was tasty, which is why I gave it 2 stars.  Food only.  The waitstaff could not keep up with even the basics of filling water glasses.  It seems this place is more concerned with the \"cute factor\" of keeping these little water carafes on the table.  But that equated to about 3 ounces of water per person.  So either bring more carafes or come more often to fill up.  
The desserts were, meh...  Yes crapes,  I get it.. But crepes filled with marshmallows and some sauce on the top for $15?  Pretty pricey.  It looked really impressive, but when you start thinking about what you actually got for your $15 the markup is probably 2000%.  
The kids enjoyed, but it is waaaaay overpriced.  Again, that is why I think it is popular with such a young age group who is not concerned with price because they are spending what their parent's give them, and they are concerned with a pretentious over the top ambiance."}
{"text":"Love the decor and feel of this place. This place is always busy so we expected a wait. They took down our contact info and called as soon as the table was ready. Our server was friendly and prompt at taking care of our orders. We ordered the Godiva Cheesecake (our all time fav) and the Tiramisu Cheesecake (this was ok). The staff was quick at turning tables which is important during busy times. I had a few questions about their dishes and those were answered as well. The only thing is not all their servers are always friendly, previous visits we have had some so so interactions and they are a little pricy. Slice of cheesecake was $12!! The only reason we keep going back is for the Godiva Cheesecake ...."}
{"text":"Great service for a small place. There isn't any space to sit. If you reserve you are told ahead of time that it's minimum $15 per person. It's a great place for desert and occasions. Haven't tried the food but it looks really good. Will try next time. Ask for Sindi she's a great waitress."}
{"text":"Surprised how great the mixed grill was! Have always loved the sweets here but needed more. It's great for sharing...lots of meats, grilled tomatoes, potatoes, even hummus."}
{"text":"Very good food. Got the wrap and hot chocolate. Very delicious. And everyone was super nice and helpful. Would definitely go there again"}
{"text":"This is a cute little dessert shop and cafe nestled between stores on Lakeshore drive.  They have a good variety of desserts to choose from as well as a small menu of cafe items such as sandwiches and soups. It is a tad bit pricey though and the serving sizes are big so it's better to share things instead of everyone ordering individual desserts. 
The eclair on the stick is very good and a must try! I also tried their hazelnut gelato and it tasted just like kinder bueno chocolate lol. 
The only reason I wouldn't give this place 5 stars is because it is very tiny and there is absolutely no place to wait. So while you are waiting for a seat, you are either standing in the way of the servers or intruding on other diners. It is a very cramped space so if you go during their busy hours, expect to wait a bit.  Also parking is tough in the evenings. We went late night so we were lucky to find a parking right in front of the shop but otherwise it seems tough to find street parking."}
{"text":"me my wife kids went on Tuesday evening around 8 pm and i was surprised how busy the pace was. it is a very nice and cozy place. it seemed like a European bistro. they had live music and  the food was amazing. my kids had cake and marshmallow in a crape which they loved we shared the mixed grilled which was amazing. Loved the place. would recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Service was OK....... we were pawned from one server to another. I like the idea of the light on the table that you press when you want to order or need the server..but it would be much more effective if the server paid more attention to it :$ the food was great but your eyes are definitely bigger than your stomach ! One change they could make is using better waffles for their waffle sandwiches. My friend asked for an extra spiced mayo because 2 people were sharing a meal and it only comes with one , the server replied \"when your finished that one\" so they had to scoop half each out of the tiny sauce cup on to their plates and she did a slight inspection before she would bring another...... The \"surprise\" me dessert was amazing ! I couldn't have been happier with my fillings.  I got brownie, strawberry, and kiwi/raspberry. Everyone who ordered it got different fillings inside the crepes from marshmallow to banana ...blueberry...and more...all great ! The pricing is a little high but you don't go there for more than one course (learned through experience)"}
{"text":"Milton Location: If only yelp allowed for 0 review rating. (TL;DR at the bottom)
  
DunknDip was a refreshing alternative from your biggest competitors Spin Dessert Cafe and Caffe Demetres and since my first visit 4 weeks ago, we have brought our whole family for desserts on 3 separate occasions.  The LAVA Cake is our favourite dessert.

On Nov 30th it was my birthday and when I was asked where I would like to go to dessert, without hesitation I picked DunknDip Milton.

This was a mistake.  The staff always made us feel rushed from the moment we were shown to our table.  We waited for 10 min and no one had still come to take the order, let alone provide water.  Cutlery on the table was visibly dirty and when we requested for a spoon the waitress brought out another dirty one.  When my father-in-law finally spoke up to request a cleaner one, she simply wiped it with a tissue at the table-side and mentioned that this will have to be because they are extremely busy.  We looked around and there were approximately 4 tables with guests *one of which was ours*.  Completely unacceptable in service industry.  

Finally after nearly 15 min *our first interaction since the time we were seated*, a waitress came to take our order.  We ordered the \"BACK TO THE FUTURE\" waffles and a Red Velvet Cake.  We Between 5 of us we were ready to get 4 desserts, however given the service we restrained ourselves before placing the order for remaining 2 people.  When we received our dessert, it did not match the description waitress had provided.  After taking one bite each we unanimously agreed that waffles were abnormally cold and tough to break apart with barely chocolate drizzled making it very dry and hard to swallow.  We STILL had not been served water making this experience that much worse.  When we were able to finally capture the waitress's attention, we were served with 3 glasses and a bottle of water between 5 adults.  She promised as soon as she can she will grab the remaining 2.

Sometime went by and we had to request for glasses once again.  No one came to follow up on how we were doing with our desserts.  We finally requested to speak to the manager and to our surprise came to know there was no one on duty.  We were told that Silvia (Manager) would be working the following day after 2PM.  We decided to leave and speak to her about our experience the following day.

This is when situation went from bad to worse.  My wife spoke with Siliva and highlighted the concern.  Instead of offering a solution on the spot she mentioned she will call us back later in the day.  We did not hear back from her.  The following day we decided to follow up with her and called her back.  She mentioned that it was really busy and hence she could not return the call.  We understand that service and food industry can be unpredictable, but we at least expected her to follow up with any sort of updates.  

When we did speak to her Dec 3 around 2PM, she did not offer any proactive solutions that one would expected from a manager to help demonstrate that customer service is of value and priority to DunknDip organization.  We finally spoke out and mentioned that we would like to return with the same individuals in the coming week and hopefully she can offer us complementary desserts as a means to reestablish our trust in customer service at DunknDip.

She agreed and we made plans to visit the place on Wednesday Dec 7.

Later in the evening we received a follow up call from Silvia withdrawing the earlier offer.  She mentioned she had a chance to speak to the waitress, and how it was mentioned to her that the dessert was half eaten and we did not pay the bill.  Although we had already been over the night's experience with her again, we mentioned clearly that in a group of 5 we each tasted the dessert with one bite each before sending it back.  A competent manager would understand that before talking to us in an accusations tone.  

So in conclusion, i'd like to bring this to light in hopes the upper-management holds higher standard of customer service than Silvia at DunkNDip.  

I apologize for the long email and appreciate you taking time out to read this.  

TL;DR - Rushed service, stale/cold waffle, no water for the table. Manger has worse customer service than staff. Invited us back for a complementary visit only to follow up later by telling us we lied to them and ate without paying."}
{"text":"One of the best dessert places in the city and also a very welcoming staff. Would definitely recommend the mousse cake. It is delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food..beautifully plated..all the extra touches...even in the washroom..hand towels...helpful staff...too much food..can share!"}
{"text":"Best dessert place on the face of the earth! 

The most amazing thing on the menu is the Dunk'nDip Specialty. It's a crepe full of fruit and topped with delicious Belgian chocolate and you can add gelato if you'd like. the portions are exceptional and delicious. 

It beats Demetre's by a long shot. 

Great for families and perfect for date night!"}
{"text":"After seeing so many pictures of their beautiful desserts on instagram, my friends and I were so excited to try this place out. We arrived at around 9pm on a Saturday night, and was told the wait would be around 30 min, so we put our names down and the waitress told us to wait upstairs and she would call us down when a table was ready. I'm just confused to as why they have an upstairs waiting area (with tables and chairs) yet they don't serve people there... it honestly seems like a waste of space. 

We decided to order the \"Dunk n' Dip Specialty\" (a crepe filled with fresh fruits, drizzled with the chocolate of your choice - we got milk chocolate), and \"Make a Wish\" (brownies and cream puffs topped with gelato of your choice and chocolate drizzle of your choice). With the crepe, it was good, but nothing special - it looks better than it tastes. The portion size wasn't worth it for the price of $18. We were even more disappointed with the other dessert - the concept is cute (we celebrated a friend's early birthday) but literally it's just 4 two-bite brownies, 4 cream puffs, a scoop of gelato (I've had better vanilla gelato) and chocolate on top. I could make that myself for way under $16. 

The cafe area was really cute - it has a vintage feel to it. The service was decent - in the beginning the waitress wasn't exactly friendly (she wasn't rude but we felt like she didn't even want us to be there) but after we sat down and had our desserts, we had nice chat with her. We split the bill in 3 and it came to around $13 each... which is pretty expensive when we weren't even full (like for example, in comparison to Demetre's which has bigger portion sizes for a cheaper price). Overall, cute concept and pretty desserts, but definitely not worth the price and the wait."}
{"text":"Where NOT to go!
This place opened recently and I was interested to try something new. Well, we did and it seems as though the owner does not have much interest in his employees cooking skills. Perhaps they chose anyone off the street who can boil an egg...?! :) A young girl served me a freezing cold crepe that she had 'just' prepared . I could go on about how terrible the food was but the most amusing part of my experience was after eating only 5 blueberries they still charged me for the crepe which i returned and in turn only discounted a mere 20% off.
Do you not agree they should pay me for all the disappointment?"}
{"text":"Charming place and very friendly staff. Food and dessert were yummy. We ordered creamy mushroom bread bowl soup and crepe specialty with almond gelato, delicious!"}
{"text":"Really impressed with the delicious crepe and the presentation. The cheesecake was to die for as well. What would have made it amazing was if the table itself didn't feel like it was from ikea. The decor can be tacky but food makes up for it. (and the lineups on weekend is a indicative of the yumminess)."}
{"text":"Went here with my husband and another couple.  My husband ordered a brownie dessert and they said they were out of brownies.  ( the waitress told us that the owners were coming and they needed to go to the store... did they buy their brownies at the grocery store?)  My friend ordered a tea and they said they were out of tea bags (with 5 or so different teas on the menu) and my friend's husband ordered a red velvet cheesecake and they were also out of the red velvet cheesecake.  This is all over the course of one visit! Service was super slow. Two of us got our cheesecakes (one had a strawberry and the other didn't) at least 15 mins before everyone else got their orders. We didn't want to be rude and eat our cheesecakes when the others were still waiting.  The red velvet pancakes looked like a messy mix of chocolate, strawberries and chocolate ( not red velvet) pancakes. My friend has to ask twice for cream for his coffee (btw, we were the only table of guests at the time).  Hmmm I'm probably missing something but I'll leave it at that. Never going back."}
{"text":"I am a fan of crepes and who doesn't like chocolate.. However I probably shouldn't have ordered surprise me crepes, I wasn't happy.. One of them was filled with gelato n I happen to eat that one last, so by then it had melted and I ended up wasting it. So my suggestion is don't take surprises. I will visit again to try other things on their menu coz who doesn't like chocolate!!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place.  It was a disappointment.  First off, the first thing I noticed on the table was the knife and fork setting on a red vinyl insert.  It was dusty!  Very bad impression.  Then the waitress gave us a light up call bell for the table.  I was instructed to put the light on when I was ready to order.  In other words, the waitress did not check on us at other times.  Service was poor and slow.  Considering the price they charge for the cake, I expected it to be served on nice plates.  My plate was chipped in at least three places, and so was my dad's plate.  There was also no accommodations for diet concerns.  They do not have lactose free milk so I had water with my cake! The only reason I give this place a one star rating is because otherwise the review would not be posted."}
{"text":"Very attractive flavors and choices  highly over priced food. Paid 15 dollars for a simple dessert. It was worth 6 bux.  Probably will not be going back. I'm positive I'm not going back. It's just not for me. Port credit or not."}
{"text":"This is by far the only place in Mississauga with such an awesome atmosphere, the setup is modern and chic.  The desserts and coffee are excellent, portions well worth the value.  Staff are very friendly and helpful.  If you haven't checked this place out yet, you are missing an experience you won't forget. Go check it out, it's an absolutely must visit."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place, but they were dashed!

My friend and I wanted to try fondue. We made a specific trip here for it. It took a very long time for a server to come to the table, despite the things you tap when you are ready for your order to be taken. (I'm talking 10 minutes from when we were seated, and it WASN'T busy.) We wanted a kind of sampler of fondue. The only one that they had available was the main deal, $30 worth of fondue and items to dip, and we weren't that hungry! We saw, written on the menu, that they had a $12(?) plate of fondue, that came with coffee, or something along those lines. We were told it wasn't available, because it wasn't the right day of the week for it. We ended up not having fondue at all, because we didn't want to have a huge order we couldn't eat between the two of us, and we ordered crepes. They were both dry, and sparse, and the service continued to take a long time. I don't eat potato chips, and they didn't have any other options, at all, for the side! I wouldn't have minded a salad (they obviously have the ingredients for it) but was told they don't have anything else. 

Won't be going back a second time!"}
{"text":"The singer musician Arlene was fantasticDessert \"too much not enough\" was also good.  Decor, washroom, location....good.  Very cool place."}
{"text":"They served us ROTTEN YOGURT. It had gone so bad that I couldn't get the taste out. Thankfully my friend is a doctor and gave me something so I wouldn't get sick. Once I bought it to their attention, they took off 2.50 off my bill and charged me for the full thing. Terrible. I'm at the lakeshore location like twice a week. Certainly never returning here. Hopefully I won't get food poisoning tomorrow either. 

Not only is the food at this location un fresh, service was questionable. 

Stay clear of this location and go to the port credit one. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and overall experience!!! If I could give a lower rating, I would. I had this place bookmarked on my Yelp app for about 3 months and was super excited to finally try it out. I had called ahead to make a reservation but this place doesn't accept reservations for parties smaller than 8 people, which is a little annoying considering how small this place is. Regardless, I was determined to try it out so i went with three other people. When we arrived there were no tables available on the main floor, but the waitress opened up the lounge area upstairs for us and gave us menus. The place upstairs was chilly, quiet and quite uncomfortable. The waitress came back about 15 minutes later to take our order...and that was the last time we saw her. We waited an Hour and 15 minutes and did not even receive our waters in this time! I understand that it was a little busy, but an hour long wait for WATER is just appalling! If the restaurant cannot handle the volume of customers, the logical thing to do is not seat anymore customers...clearly this place didn't get the memo. In the end, my group and I literally took out belongings and just walked out. To add insult to injury...as we were walking out, I had made eye contact with our waitress to make sure she saw us leaving, who carelessly glanced over, SAW us leaving, turned away and continued talking to someone else. I will NEVER be returning to this place again. The service was unbelievably terrible, rude, and unprofessional. I'm extremely disappointed, and quite frankly aggravated at the lack of care and customer service! TERRIBLE PLACE!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and keep trying to give it the benefit of the doubt. But this last time was exceptionally awful. Our waitress was rude and when we ordered she was so unenthusiastic that my aunt had called her out on it (there were 5 of us). The fondue was subpar, there was no light underneath it so after 5 minutes it was cold. 
I most definitely will never come back. Everything is WAY overpriced. 
If i could give it a 0 i would."}
{"text":"This place was great, my first time. Parked right out from, got a window seat. The waitress knew lots about the business and the menu(we were curious how long it had been there, etc). The cheesecakes were to die for, the gelato is one of a kind and the mousse"}
{"text":"4.5 stars! 

I love this place - I've been here twice and ordered differently both times. I was more than satisfied on each occasion and have already highly recommended it to my friends! 

My past orders (including dining partners): 
Hawaiian Breeze Hot Chocolate: 4.5 
Crispy Pearls Hot Chocolate: 4 
Simple Joy (I think - it was the banana and custard crepe): 4 
Dunk n Dark: 4.5 
Banana Split: 4.5 
Brioche: 3.5 (gelato was amazing, could care less for the brioche itself). 

It's a very small, but really well kept and decorated place on lakeshore in Mississauga. They have live music and live jazz on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, but besides that, they are a pretty quiet place for a nice date. They also have lunch buffets during weekday lunch hours. It seemed alright, but I haven't tried it or any of their savoury food for that matter (they have a surprisingly plentiful selection of savoury food). 

I found that their larger desserts (anything not in a jar or on a stick) are definitely shareable. I would recommend that if you get their larger desserts, then either don't get a hot chocolate or share one, or share the dessert and get individual hot chocolates - I found it was much too indulgent to solo both! Coffee might be a better match, or a smaller dessert with hot chocolate. This is good quality chocolate and it's quite heavy. 

Their gelato (do not miss the salted caramel, hazelnut, almond or chocolate) and Belgium chocolate (white, dark, milk) are to DIE FOR. I don't think just any dessert place would do anymore after trying this place! I haven't tried their cakes or macarons yet but I'm pretty excited to go back and do so. Their crepes are just the right consistency and plating is so gorgeous! I've also yet to try the waffles, but they looked phenomenal. 

One thing I docked points off for was that the waitress, albeit meant in a helpful way, offered to microwave our hot chocolates should they get cold and too sweet. I found that a little off-putting and amateur/unprofessional. I believe they should either change their recipe for the hot chocolate to avoid the gradual sweetness overload, and perhaps warm their hot chocolates up more to begin with. It was a nice gesture, but in the hospitality business, microwaving is a big no-no. She was sweet nonetheless, but I believe she should leave that bit out when serving customers. 

All that being said, I adore this place! Even the way they serve napkins is very cool (won't ruin the surprise). It's clean, friendly and delicious. The portions are shareable, and the desserts I've tried have been quite indulgent/heavy, although hauntingly memorable, so be mindful of that when ordering. 

CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!"}
{"text":"I've been to dunk n dip twice now. Our first experience was when it first opened. 
I'm giving it a 3 stars because: good food, nice location, and good space.

Two things that can be improved on are definitely service, menu choices, and pricing. 
 
For the size and the amount of staff they have our group expected a bit better service... We had to remind them twice to get cutlery and water (both of which we had to mention as they did not offer). 

There are several menu choices available, however the selection is too wide and quite repetitive. This made ordering a little difficult as there was too much to choose from. 

Now for the good... The quality of the food as well as the taste are on point. All of our dishes were just enough sweet and not overwhelming portioned like a Demetres cafe dessert. It didn't feel too disgusting to finish our plates. 
The ambience and the overall decor is great, really modern and a young and hip crowd. This is a great place for a first date! 

Overall, the concept is great! The execution just needs a little work :) but would recommend  trying maybe on a less busy night."}
{"text":"Yesterday, I drove for 40min to come to this place, reached at 8:30pm. The waiter asked us to leave and come back after one hour. We asked her to take our name and number. She refused, sayinf she cant its full! We said ok we gonna wait in th store, so we garantee that we will get seated, but she also refused and said sorry u cant wait in the store! 

This is my first time coming, and I have not ever been treated like that!! If its busy you can take our name and number, there is still eough time to take name, as the closing its on 12am. I do not recommand going to this cafe. No customer service, they even dont respect customer. We left yesterday and went to Demetres."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Won't serve at 11:26PM while the store closes at midnight. Entry tables and still no service. Don't bother trying them, go to Dimitries."}
{"text":"Dunk'n Dip is a very brightly lit, fancy looking dessert place.  There's extra details in some of the decor (marshmallow filled table legs) and custom place setting adds extra points to a surprisingly extensive menu including mostly desserts but some savoury crepes/sandwiches too.

You'll realize after a brief look at the menu that everything is quite expensive.  A tea is over $5, and most other desserts are close to $20!  Fortunately, teas come with a small skewer of cookies.  

Beyond this, the actual dessert/cookies themselves are slightly underwhelming.  We tried several gelato flavours which were all good, but really didn't feel like it was worth the price tag.  With that price tag, I fully expected to lounge around and chat for a while, but our (otherwise friendly) waitresses kept coming by to clean up even though we were still slowly working on it.  

One extra star for a live musician on a Friday night.  it really made the whole experience better!"}
{"text":"I have had better crepe but the cool thing here was...fountain of chocolate White, Milk and Dark and you can choose to have one or more poured over you desert. 

The place itself is designed and themed nicely and very colorful. There are various type of seating corner 2 to 4 to 6, chairs to couches but its not super spacious. the service level was decent and the staff was quick to take order and bring the stuff.

Menu was quite large, they have gelato and macarons too. I went for a banana chocolate crepe. we went with option of Milk and Dark chocolate dip. The crepe it self was wrapped around a whole banana and chocolate all over it. Over all  the crepe was average compared to other place I have been to... May be other stuff on the menu are great but will have to try them.

One awesome thing was they bring a tiny napkin and pour water on it to make it puffed and open up for you to clean the hands, which was quite cool."}
{"text":"The land of \"sweet tooth's\"! If you can consume chocolate by the pounds and don't mind 3 cavities after one visit, this place is for you! They have the choice of 3 types of chocolate toppings (dark, milk, white) and you can put them on any of their dessert. 

To be honest, I've been here several times and I have yet to finish an entire dessert on my own and I have quite the sweet tooth. I'd recommend sharing with friends. 

Overall, this place is a fun and light-hearted environment to catch up with friends and go for dessert when in the port credit area"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I made reservations for five girlfriends and they gave us a special treat for that.  We ordered a good selection of food.  I split the turkey club sandwich and it was a huge portion.  Very tasty and the potatoes were perfect.  I tired some of the other wraps which were great too.  Then onto the main event. Dessert can't say anything more 
All amazing and decadent and heavenly
I highly recommend 
Decor amazing 
Prices good
All halal
Service with a smile"}
{"text":"Terrible slow service. We had to keep asking for silver ware and water. Our desserts and drinks came literally one at a time. The first person who got their order was literally done eating 15 min before the last person even got their order, and they had the same dish. Management needs to hire more staff or learn how to time their orders better. Very disappointing service. Only 1 star because some of their gelato flavors are actually good."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Love the monster crepe I devoured!! OMG 

Place looks very modern and decor is very nice.  However, they left the door open and there was a lot of flies inside the place which was kinda nasty.  Servers were very nice and well trained.  Price is decent compare to other dessert and portions are large here.  See pic of  the crepe we got

Def the place to go for Dessert in Port Credit.  They also had the magic towel that grows when you add water. I first saw that in Asia a few years back.  Pretty cool."}
{"text":"Finally, I get to write a review about this place after weeks of waiting. It seemed like every time I was ready to go for lunch, snack or dinner, I would get fed elsewhere and miss my opportunity to dine here. Not on this day! No sir!

Why have I been so passionate about reviewing this place you ask? Well, I happened to visit them the very first day they opened their doors and was immediately drawn in by their unique concept! Chocolate fountains to decorate and flavor everything from crepes to hot chocolates!

I mean, it's like how I imagine every diabetic dreams of going one day, drowning in a sugary fountain of chocolate (and for the record they have 4 flavours - Dark, White, Milk and Caramel Chocolate). They make made to order waffles, crepes, crepe fettuccine, fruit platters, and more and more... and more... and more. 

if you don't want to wait for something to be made they have an assortment of gelato, pastries, cakes, that you can eat and run at your leisure!

But all of that means nothing to me. Nothing! DnD is becoming known as a premium date and dessert place, but I'm here to talk about the lunch I had recently that inspired this review.

I'm talking about a unique in house creation known as: The Torpita

The stuffed love child of a Tortilla and a Pita, more pocket and double the holding capacity. No tears leading to mess and cooked perfectly with your choice of fillings! I had mine with spinach, chicken, cheese, assorted veggies and chipotle mayo.

First of all, there was no shortage of protein in this wrap. Packed! Easily close to full chicken breast. Secondly, cut in half the torpita wrap was easily double the size of anything else I'd ever eaten. THIRD, the veggies were fresh and the wrap looked to be created by an artist as each piece of filling was visible and perfectly spread out (there was no \"clump\" of sauce or toppings - perfectly mixed). FOURTH, the sides of sliced cucumber, pickles and roasted red peppers accented the meal perfectly. 

I had tried samples of the gelato, a mochaccino (made with chocolate fountain chocolate), their fetuccini, waffle on a stick... all of the above were out of this world! But what has made me fall for this place is the torpita!

Thanks to the amazingly well trained staff for their informative explanations that led to this life changing decision!

{"text":"Hidden gem of a dessert place in Mississauga. Crepes are beautifully decorated and portion size is huge, perfect for sharing. The decor inside is really nice with comfy leather seats and good lighting. It's a great place for a date or a night of eating out and catching up.

Things are still pricier than I'd like, which is why this place is only getting a 4/5 stars. We got a Dunk'n'Dip Specialty and the Crepe Fettuccini both with a side scoop of jumbo gelato. This turned out to be over $40 and despite being extremely tasty, I'm not sure it was worth the price."}
{"text":"Great dessert selection and live music! Came here one evening with my family and we really enjoyed ourselves. Suggest sharing!"}
{"text":"Cam here on a weekday night and it wasn't busy.

Pros:
- Nice ambiance

Cons:
- Very pricey for what's offered.
- Food tastes bland. Very tasteless
- Service was sub par. As we asked for the bill we informed the server that we posted a picture of our food online (they offer 10% off if you do so) and she said ok but did not give the discount

Overall would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"We waited for more than 40mn standing on the walkway and no one care it was bad experience I am not sure if will consider it again."}
{"text":"Great selection. Chocolate crepes are very delicious.

One of top 5 dessert places in mississauga."}
{"text":"Dunk'n Dip has a large variety of desserts but not my go to dessert place.

Pros:
- Large variety of desserts, drinks and even food options
- Location is in a convenient part of Lake shore, close to other shops, restaurants and parks
- The food is presented very well and tastes amazing
- The atmosphere is unique and a nice place to hang out with friends

Cons:
- Waitresses take a very long time to notice the light to order is on, we had a table right beside the counter where they worked and they still did not notice us
- Plates, cutlery and miscellaneous objects were dropped by the staff multiple times which ruined the comfortable dining experience
- The portions are very large, I can finish a dessert from other dessert restaurants but here I could barely finish half"}
{"text":"Never was a big fan of going out for deserts, but this place was great. We walked to Dunk'n Dip on a cold day from a couple blocks down. As soon as we entered, we were provided seats and we both felt warm and cozy. Much needed after a long cold day! 

I wasn't too hungry so we decided to share desert tonight. We got a slice of red velvet cake, and a double espresso. Both were great. Can't really screw up an espresso but I like how it came with a tiny chocolate chip cookie. Great touch. The red velvet cake was soft and delicious and was topped with white chocolate. Very enjoyable and not too sweet. 

If I am in the area, I will come by again! Oh I just remembered! This place is pretty small, so don't be too surprised if its full when you drop by! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good food, decent dessert, but bad customer service. Desserts are over-priced compared to Caffe Demetres or Spin, where you can get more variety for less. Nothing special, but would consider coming back if the employees were friendly & polite."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! It is cozy and very relaxing... Customer service was great... One of the best places for desert... The chocolate smell was refreshing:)

They also serve some food.. \"Say you love me\" plate was just Yummmy.. I recommend a couple to share the plate and share the desert because the portions are big.."}
{"text":"The food is great, glutinous fat fest lol. The fruit is fresh, crepes are thin and soft, and the waffles are bomb.

The servers are super nice, but not in sync with each other. I had three servers ask me if I wanted water, I said yes to all but it took a hot minute to get any. They got the order wrong, but we ate it anyway because it looked amazing. We asked for cutlery, there were 4 of us and they brought 1 for some reason. Just little things like that.

Nice atmosphere, clean, great macaroon display."}
{"text":"Love the lounge area! And the waitress was very lovely but for the price you pay you're left a little unsatisfied. More generous portions to match the price would make this place go to a 5. Delicious desserts though!"}
{"text":"Came to this place for the first time with a few friends for brunch.  We loved the food!  They have both sweet and savoury!  Everything looks amazing, the service was pleasant (they took a little long to clear our plates but that's just a very minor complaint).  They have a wide selection of sweets (macarons, cakes, gelatos, waffles and crepes!).  I love their chocolate, it was very smooth and tasty.   I also had their roast beef crepe and it was surprisingly very light, I was able to order the eclair on a stick.  The restaurant itself is very very clean and cozy.  The decor made their food extra appetizing.  Parking was also convenient especially on a Sunday because street parking is free.  I totally recommend coming here for brunch or dessert."}
{"text":"Ambience, service, quality .. THUMBS UP! The waiters were helpful, dessert servings were like dinners .. Balance of flavours was very well managed."}
{"text":"This is my favourite dessert shop in Port credit . Their Macarons, Cakes crepe , gelato and coffee is a really amazing for a quick bite or if you're just looking for a place to satisfy your sweet tooth.

They have a live musician performer to delight your ears whilst enjoying their beautiful decor and sumptuous menu.
 
They have sweet and Savory crepes and fondue . Their crepe called 'Surprise me' allows you to be excited since you never know what you'll get. Mine has marshmallows, strawberries and berries topped with my choice of dark chocolate sauce. Over all this place is amazing.

Tip: Their serving is good enough to share unless you want a lion's share."}
{"text":"When we walked in we found the restaurant was so cute. Great place for a date. The decor emitted such a positive feeling we were excited about our afternoon snack.

The first thing you notice when you open the menu are the expensive prices. A main desert such as a waffle or a crepe is priced slightly under $20. However the pictures in the menu looked delicious so we were excited to try it!

We ordered the dunk and dip specialty (crepe stuffed with various fruits covered in chocolate) and the tiramisu cheesecake covered in chocolate. To drink we ordered the tea.

The crepe was good, even though it was not hot

The cake was old and hard to chew

Tea came with 3 cookies that was advertised as freshly baked but was old as well. Refills not provided.

Total of the bill was slightly under $40 before tax and tip. We felt the food was not worth that price. There are plenty of other alternatives in the area for half the price and better food quality. Would not recommend and unlikely chance for repeat visit.

I rarely do reviews on Yelp, but felt this needed to be shared."}
{"text":"Horrible HORRIBLE service. There were maybe 6 people working on the floor that night yet our server could not be bothered to assist us. There was no cutlery provided when we sat down and we did not get the cutlery until 10 mins after our food was served. After ordering the food, we all got our orders at separate times and they were missing items (no ice cream or wrong sauce). We asked for water which never showed up. We all came out to eat dessert together NOT in separate intervals. 
The icing on the cake of this shitty experience was, that after taking our order our server(Nabeela) was not seen. We could not find her so we asked another server for assistance. All our food/cutlery was served by Megan (who was not our server that night) she was running around doing everyone's job while they chatted near the door!  Our actual server only showed up at the very end to collect the bill and tip. Me and my friend we not expecting 5-star service but expecting there to be spoons and forks at the table once the food is served should be a basic element of every dining experience."}
{"text":"I would be surprised if they remain open after a year or two - or after the novelty wears out. 
Upon entry, it's nice. But if you look closely, the decor is all over the place. Marshmallow under the glass floor, random cakes on top of ikea bookshelves, nice chairs, leather cutlery holders? It's nice... but strange.

I was there with a few friends, and we all decided to order something savoury first. I was surprised to see how big their menu was. So many savoury and sweet options... but there is such thing as too much! 

We ordered a couple of crepes and sandwiches, and the server came up to us 3 times to inform us they ran out of things.
- They ran out of sweet potato...so we can only get home fries
- They ran out of roast beef... so my friend had to change the order. 
- They ran out of \"eggo\" waffles for the waffle burger so they used bread. 

It was a Wednesday, and they weren't getting these items until Friday! I understand... but instead of putting money into leather cutlery holders, why not make sure you get your produce on time!?! Or find a back up solution? None of the items tasted like they were freshly made. Burger meat looked like it came from a box you buy at the grocery store, and it was on the menu for $18?!?

I got the \"Evergreen Crepe\" and this was the first time I've seen raw vegetables in a crepe. The spinach, peppers, and tomatoes were raw, and the mushrooms were cold and pre-cooked, and it had some pickled bell peppers. No seasoning. And the crepe was sweet. They probably have the same crepe batter for sweet and savoury items. It was like having a ridiculous salad inside of a sweet crepe. 

I have no idea who planned this restaurant and menu, but it does not feel cohesive or practical. There are so many things that just don't make any sense. We wanted to order desert/drinks, but decided to just leave. Honestly, the best part of the meal was probably the home fries; the seasoning was really good, and they were crispy. But the ketchup bottle they serve on the table was the tiny glass Heinz bottles you'd get as a sample or something. Ours was empty, as you would expect them to be after every guest. What's wrong with a larger bottle?!

Desserts look good, but don't bother with anything savoury."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent. We were treated well and did not have to wait a long time for the food to be served. A must try is back to the future, dunkin dip speciality"}
{"text":"This place caught my eye when I was going to H-Mart, so decided to check it out on a Friday night with a few girl friends. I liked the decor but the place was way too bright, especially on a Friday night. 

The menu items were much more expensive than expected. We shared the Surprise Me crepe, which were 3 crepes wrapped in 'surprise' fillings, served with a shot of chocolate and gelato. Gelato was good, the crepes were underwhelming for the price - they just looked like big dumplings. The crepes were: banana, strawberry, and brownie. 

We also ordered teas and coffee, for about $5 each. It came with a skewer of cookies, but I would've preferred a cheaper drink with no cookies, especially since we already ordered dessert. 

The live musician was the highlight of the place. 

Sadly, I am disappointed with this place and was hoping to bring my husband - but that likely won't happen."}
{"text":"Interesting place, interesting concept, but may be overpriced for what it is. Good to share, but desserts feel like they're pricier than most meals for the quality equivalent."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to visit during your stroll down Lakeshore, Port Credit, Mississauga. Great tasting desserts and pleasant service. Only drawback is that the desserts fir the three of us came one after the other. Kind if kills the conversation flow.

My wife and I had the Wonderland Waffles and Dunk'n Dip Waffles. The Wonderland Waffles was great but, the Dunk'n Dip Waffles with Pineapples was a mismatch. It was a mistake saying yes to the Pineapples. My son had a Chocolate Fudge Cake and the guy was in heaven.

A very clean place and a romantic red and black ambience. The place was full of marshmallows and found it very interesting.

The servers were very pleasant and was attentive.

I felt though that the desserts were a little over priced."}
{"text":"We've seen really good and yummy pictures of the dessert here and wanted to try out a new dessert place so we finally went there on a Sunday afternoon and the place was actually pretty packed. The restaurant looked great with the black & red theme and cool decoration ( I really liked their chocolate fountain!). Their waffle and crepe were just ok, quite disappointed actually; the chocolate sauce was good though. Overall we think that they quite were pricey for what we were getting. We would prefer Demetre over this anytime."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert and not only is the service subpar at best but the food is not good especially for the price. Asked for water and proceeded to wait 10 minutes and then got a pitcher without cups. The waitresses and waiters seem very confused and unorganized. For $17 I got a shredded crepe covered in milk chocolate with a scoop of grocery store ice cream tasting gelato. Would definitely not recommend if you are looking for a dessert place with good desserts. Save your money and time and go to Demtres up the street."}
{"text":"If you have a craving for something sweet I recommend the red velvet cheesecake, it was amazing and very favourable. The only thing I didn't like was the seating arrangements, they  are really close together. If you don't like sitting closely to others I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tight space. Ordered a plate of fruits dumplings with lots of chocolate sauces. Ate way too much sweet.  Chocolate overdosed."}
{"text":"Great little place in Mississauga!

I went there with my husband on a Saturday afternoon for a cup of coffee. The service was fantastic, ambiance looks great and there is plenty of food and drink options to choose from. It's one of the few places serving Italian Lavazza coffe brand. We came from lunch and stopped by for coffee and tea. Cookies that came with the coffee were very nice too. I highly recommend the place!"}
{"text":"Would not recommend... I had the cheesecake which was the worst cheesecake I've ever had, hard as a rock. I had one bite and that was it. The gelato was not gelato it was actually ice cream. My boyfriend had the crispy crunch which was just a mason jar filled with marsh mellows and rice crispies coated in chocolate. We waited 30 minutes for the dessert (there was only one other table here) .. 30 minutes for the lattes we ordered as well. Also cost over 50$. Server never asked why we only had one bite of each meal. All in all don't come here."}
{"text":"Alright, so my cousin is in town from BC and today I decided to take her to Port Credit.  We went to Port 229 and I was hoping to get a lunch entree.  Turns out they only served brunch on Sundays....so I got my brunch, then my cousin says \"I want something sweet\".  So with the help of Yelp, I find Dunk'n Dip.  

Dunk'n Dip is like a Caffe Demetre executed properly.  She had some type of gelato, which she seemed to like.  Now onto me, I was REALLY in the mood for the sandwich and came across something called a Waffle Sandwich.  YES, I KNOW IT'S NOT DESSERT!, but I REALLY wanted a sandwich!.  

It's basically either a roast beef or turkey sandwich with three waffle slices (top, middle, bottom).  It was absolutely delicious!  Nice crispy texture, very savoury sandwich with honey mustard that had a small \"side\" of veggies and chips.  Still, the best part about it was that it's only $6.64.  Great price for a sandwich.  

So food is a definite 5/5.

As for service, very friendly, pleasant staff that will interact with you.  The shop itself is very cute too.  

This is Caffe Demetre executed properly x10 plus real food!  LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"The place is brilliant! They give you stuff and you can dip it into chocolate (or other sauces, but really, who is paying attention to that when they have chocolate!)

I ordered a waffle on a stick (You guys! A waffle on a stick! Do you see this brilliance I'm talking about here?!) and it came with dipping chocolate of my choice (I went with dark and it was delicious.) Since it was lunchtime and woman cannot live on waffle desserts alone I also ordered one of their salads. Covered in berries, nuts, and greenery it made me feel a little less bad about my dunking waffle. Or maybe that was the endorphins from the chocolate high? Either way, it was dang good and I'd be glad to go back!"}
{"text":"Small and cozy yet modern! The interior decoration is absolutely wonderful, you walk in and just want to explore for a little bit. I ordered the French onion soup in the bread bowl to start which I warn is a pretty big portion, but for those who haven't tried anything like that before I do recommend it. It also comes with a see if coffee and cookie, though I found the cookie weren't that great. For desert I ordered the dunk n dip gelato which comes with a cone & your choice of chocolate topping, I chose white. The ice cream was a wonderful flavor! I also ordered a few macarons but was quite disappointed with the macarons. First off they keep them at a very cold temperature and serve at that same temperature while macarons should be served at room temperature. Second of all they charge a little too much per macaron considering they're not made at the location. You can get cheaper freshly baked macarons at many other places. My boyfriends ordered waffles with fruit & his choice of chocolate one each waffle, we both agreed the waffles were excellent. All in all a great place to come when you want to satisfy your sweet tooth! A little pricier than other places but seeing as it's a desert focused restaurant that is to be expected & the price differences are not huge, we probably payed only $10-15 more than we would have somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm sorry that I didn't look at the reviews before going. Food was decent. Price was ok. But man oh man the service. That ruined the whole experience and the reason I won't be back. 
45 minutes to get 2 dishes. Ridiculous. I understand that there are religious holidays and that's respected, especially one when you're fasting all day and working around food. But to have me order food at 9. wait half hour. And when I finally start questioning it then tell me, oh all of our cooks without exception celebrate ramadan so as soon as the sun went down they went to eat and coincidentally that's exactly the same time you put in your order so there's no one to make it. That's just bad business. Either give the cooks the day off and have someone who can make food, or split them into breaks OR let people know that that's what's happening. 
You know even if they apologized and have taken some of the food off the bill as an apology I would've forgiven. But this is just horrible service. I only give 2 stars because the food was decent but not even that amazing to come back. Beware when going."}
{"text":"Modern. Cute. Cozy. And whoa. When I first walked in, on a Monday night, the place was busy - so busy that we ended up just getting take-out - but I also noticed that the modern and relatively small and packed space had... live music. I think what makes a local yummy eatery better is when they support local musicians by having them play in their restaurant. 

At one end of Dunk 'n' Dip's counter are three big Belgian chocolate fountains - milk, dark, and white. This is the chocolate that they serve on your plates and are what you will be dunkin' & dippin' your foods in. While it's best to go here for their dessert - marshmallows, fruits, and cakes to macarons, waffles, sweet crepes, and small pastries, they also serve savoury crepes and sandwiches if you're looking for more of a lunch or dinner option and not just dessert.  

Tip: if you're a yelper, use the check-in offer to receive 10% off! 

I ended up ordering a tiramisu cheesecake slice and chose milk chocolate out of the three for my dip. It was delicious, sweet, and creamy with a good coffee-tiramisu flavour. The cheesecake also came with one strawberry which added a more light and juicy texture to my bites. However, for the amount I paid (around  $11 with the 10% discount already applied), the cheesecake seemed too small.  If it were a $6 slice, I would have understood but I guess what you're also paying for at Dunk 'n' Dip is the dine-in experience (which I didn't do but got a chance to check out).  

Dunk 'n' Dip is a great local gem - great for dates, family, and friends.  I recommend coming here for dessert because that's what they do well, especially with their chocolate fountains.  The local music talent they showcase on weekday nights is a wonderful bonus which adds to the intimacy of the place."}
{"text":"Banana Split. Brownie Magic. 

I've been to Dunk'n Dip twice now, and failed to try these two desserts, heavy regretting it after each visit. Other people in my group let me try a bit of their portions, and they were amazing. I, on the other hand, had the pistachio gelato and chocolate eclair. They were both also very good. They also offer a house special Dunk'n Dip flavoured gelato which I believe is a mix of chocolatey flavours, which I would also like to try in the future. 

The ambiance of the restaurant is what I find most attractive about this place. Each decoration seems to be meticulously planned, and it shows. From the candy-filled vase table legs to the chocolate fountains by the front counter, the interior designing truly is a work of art. 

To further enhance the experience, the staff are always very enthusiastic and helpful, eager to give their recommendations. 

Just fantastic, Dunk'n Dip. See you soon."}
{"text":"I came for dessert with two other friends in the morning. I thought the store was cute. Near the entrance there was a board full of instax mini photos. There was a lot of stone & wood finishes and red furniture making the space feel homey or like a coldstones
We ordered:
Dunk'n Dip specialty with milk chocolate and a small scoop of pistachio gelato. $15.25 + $3.25
\"Surprise me\" mini crepes with white chocolate $15.25
The restaurant employs a lamp on each table for customers to call servers.
The order took longer to get to our table since the chocolate fountains were being set up. I'm not sure why they weren't up and running during store hours in the middle of the day.
The milk chocolate on the fruit stuffed crepe was amazing! Creamy but not too sweet. The chocolate was warm but as it got colder hardened near the icecream and plate. Ice cream is definitely recommended for any crepe.
The fruit was nice and all but wasn't all that important to me especially compared to th e chocolate and ice cream.
The surprise me crepe came with 3 mini crepes. one had a brownie in it, the second had strawberry and cream? And the third had banana and custard? The white chocolate was almost too sweet especially with the brownie crepe.
  
We overestimated the amount of crepes we could eat. We wanted to just have a snack but instead overstuffed ourselves. For future reference i think one crepe with jumbo ice cream is good for 4 people if you are looking for a snack.

I think everything was pretty overpriced even if you split an order with other people. To get the most value, I would recommend getting a plain crepe with chocolate. That's all you really need. If you want to indulge, add ice cream."}
{"text":"Love this place! We've been going there before it got famous and the place just keeps getting better and better!
Word of caution: it's always full! Make a reservation or you'll have to drop by, leave your number and you'll get a call when they're ready for you.

The salted caramel gelato is heavenly!
I don't like macarons but theirs are so good!"}
{"text":"If dining-in this place looked pretty good, but I came in for a take-out order which took about 20 minutes to get a lukewarm cappuccino which was fairly mediocre (pretty overpriced for what it is, at almost 6 bucks). I don't recommend this place if you just want to get a coffee to go."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to go that we could grab a coffee and the prospect of dessert always sounds good. We got the rice crispy with marshmallows, dark chocolate and milk chocolate. It was pretty insane, in a good way. Coffee was good the dessert was extremely indulgent and the atmosphere is super fun. Downside - its really busy (not a downside for the business at least). The prices are reasonable. I have already recommended this place to a few friends. I am sure we will be back when we are in the area and looking for a few thousand calories to consume ;-P"}
{"text":"I was here exclusively for desserts last night. Can't agree with other yelpers here, this place did not float my boat.

The place wasn't very busy, yet i had to wait 5 minutes before somebody even came and got us seated. They didn't give us any water either.

The server took our order later on and i told her specifically to bring the tea with desserts, guess what? she still brought the tea before it and i asked \"I specified to bring the tea with desserts, she is like yaaah the dessert is coming\", well it came after we were halfway through our tea.

I would have let all of that go, had the food been good. But sadly it wasn't.

I got the surprise me coz i liked the concept of crepes wrapped like a pouch, but the crepe wasn't good. It was sweet, while we all know crepes are supposed to be neuteral. I got the chocolate dip on the side and that was extremely sweet too, i planned on drinking it but i couldn't get meself too.

The only thing good here was the ambiance, it looks very inviting, but imo, they have nothing else going on for them for me to come back."}
{"text":"This place pretty awesome, chocolate fountain galore!
I came on a Friday night..after a super long work week..to such an amazing selection of waffles, crepes, cheese cake (from Cheesecake Factory), fondue, ice cream, gelato and cookies. The selection here is great! I would highly recommend coming with a few friends so you can share. 
In addition, Dunk'n Dip also serve salads, soups, sandwiches, savoury crepes etc.
I have to note that I love their variety of teas, as well as the packaging. They serve specialty teas and each tea has its own benefits. I ordered their 'Be fit' tea which is a green tea with a fruit blend. The tea also comes with a cookie so just in case for those who aren't big on desserts.
Back to the reason that I was here...
The item that we got was a fruit crepe with dark and milk chocolate drizzle. The fruit was fresh and I really liked how we could choose the chocolate drizzle. We also added gelato on the side- pistachio to be exact.  The portion size was perfect to share.

The service was great and although we had to wait a bit on a Friday night.. They were super accommodating in this small establishment.  Staff were super knowledgeable and since I always like to ask for their recommendation they were super helpful.

I really enjoyed this unexpected night out and it definitely is a great place for hangouts and chill time. I will be back with girlfriends next time...maybe for their fondue special.. Mmnoms"}
{"text":"Good deserts. Very slow service. I don't understand why when there's like 5 people working all the time ????"}
{"text":"First and LAST time here. 
I definitely found out why the wait was almost an hour.....THE SERVICE WAS EXTREMELY SLOW!!!
There was lots of staff and it's just serving ice cream, crepes and slices of cake!!! Why it took sooo long - no one understands. 
Ready for the best part?
So as a table of 5, person 1 got their slice of cake (after a long wait), then the patten seemed to be, once that person was completely finished, person 2 got their 2 scoops of ice cream,....I never knew it could take that long to cut a slice of cake and then to scoop 2 scoops of ice cream and serve them in at least a 10 minute span from each other. Then of course our next person (person 3) finally got their crepe once person 2 was finished their ice cream. Then magically the last 2 people got their crepes at the same time! WOW
Getting a refill on water...HA! That never happened. Our bimbo waitress was just standing around. 
Finally after 2 hours, and it taking 2 people to figure out we wanted the bills instead of just the credit/debit machines, we finally got to get the f**** out of there! 
Horrible and soooo expensive!!! My ass that's real gelato.  You don't serve gelato with big desserts like that! You're wasting the gelato name. If you can't produce the Italiano experience, don't even try."}
{"text":"We've been to this place twice since it's opened. The crepes are delicious and the portions are huge. The restaurant is well decorated, with a couple small sidewalk tables for al-fresco dining. You can see that the owners really care; the chocolate in the fountains is high quality, the espresso fantastic and properly prepared. They've definitely spent a lot of time, money, and effort on the place and it shows. If you want some combination of gelato, crepes, fruit, and, of course, melted chocolate, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"cute atmosphere... strange waitress ...
So I found out about this place by accident via instragram.  I thought it would be a nice sweet treat on a cold night. I was super excited to go here because all the fun pictures on instagram.

Being our first time we asked our waitress what their speciality is. She said they didn't really have one and that everything is good...  on the glass wall beside us it said \"dunk'n dip speciality\".
I ordered the rice krispy thing in a jar (can't think of the name) it was basically just rice krispy cereal, tiny marshmellows and melted chocolate layered in a jar. Hmm..
They could have done sooo much more with that... like melted marshmellows or something. Tasty but so simple. After 4 spoonfuls you're sick of it lol

My boyfriend had some brownie thing with chocolate gelato. He enjoyed it and raved about it. I still think there's so much room for improvement with these dishes.

We also shared a peppermint hot chocolate... that was pretty good.

If i go back I would maybe try the fondue"}
{"text":"This is a must if you love chocolate! The place is a bit small but the delicious desserts make up for it. We ordered the surprise me, eclair on a stick and hot chocolates."}
{"text":"We ordered redvelvet pancake and it was alright..the pancake was over mixed, so it was not fluffy at all. it was dense and the strawberries tasted like onion, the cook in the back didnt even clean the knife before they sliced the strawberries...fail"}
{"text":"So I went to this place to try it out. Before going I went to visit their website to see what's up. First thing I notice is (1) they are new and (2) they offer franchise opportunity. For a new restaurant to offer franchising right away screams red flag in my book. I'm old school. Money in restaurant business should be made from food and service before thinking of living off your franchisee's royalties.  So I ordered veges/crepe and dessert for my partner. The whole bill was more than your average for a crepe place. No biggie! But I'd like to be served fresh cut food if you're gonna ask me to pony up at that level for batter and veges. The mushrooms are canned quality. My order on the menu said 'grilled veges' are included, they weren't. The potatoes were Costco quality or something similar. But the one that was unsettling for me were their packets of ketchup and chili sauce. The same packets of hot sauce I would find in a chinese restaurant that offers $1 dim sum. I get it, they're new and still trying to iron out the wrinkles in their operation. I could tell because I had to wait for our orders for 25 minutes and this place is small. The decor is great and is right for 20-35 year old. The crowd who just started to make decent money from their jobs after graduation. The prices they charged didn't reflect the food. The waffle was bland, thin and dull. The should serve fresh and no canned products at the prices they charge. The gelato was good and the cakes they sell here are sourced from Cheesecake Factory among others, I'm guessing. Nothing is made by these guys. I don't mind paying but don't like the feeling I was ripped off. I left feeling I paid for the decor used and not the food. Be better guys. Also, I would re-think that franchising option at this time. You have a lot of work to do. You get two stars because you can go either way on my next visit."}
{"text":"This is a great dessert spot and the atmosphere is great! I find they are always flowing with business and usually have a wait, for a business with so much customers I hope they would see the value of expanding in the near future. The location I went to in Port Credit Mississauga was beautiful but very crowded and it felt like my fiancé and I were in other people's conversations when seated with hardly any space between other tables.The menus were vast with many different dessert choices all very delicious ! In the future we will definitely only order one and split it amongst the two of us because we definitely didn't plan on spending $60 for two  desert plates as well as some of the desserts were just too sweet. All in all I would go again for the great atmosphere and decoration as well as the very pleasant servers !"}
{"text":"After dinner we decided to stop by Dunk n Dip for some dessert.  Their atmosphere was warm and inviting with staff members who are very attentive to your needs. They have a table lamp that you can press when you are ready to order which I found was neat! Their chocolate fountains, cakes, gelatos and sorbets looked delicious.  I appreciated that they had non dairy options for individuals like myself who can't have dairy. I ordered \"Fell in Love\" which is a waffle cone with a scoop of gelato and fruits galore! I overestimated my ability to finish the dessert because clearly it could have been shared between two people. They gave plenty of fruit which I also appreciated as well. They also had live music yesterday evening which was a nice addition to my evening. A great spot for dessert ! (They do also have other hots meals as well)"}
{"text":"After a disastrous experience with their sister location, I had to brace myself before coming here. Thankfully, I had a pleasant time and caught-up with a friend over some desserts with only minor issues.

A slice of cake will run you around $10 after tax and tip. They make the effort to dress it up with some whipped cream, a drizzle of you choice of chocolate (white, milk, dark) and garnish with a dipped strawberry. So not bad. 

When we went to pay, my friend used cash and the staff had a hard time at the till. Turns out they didn't have enough bills for her, so ended up giving her a pile of coins. They were apologetic, so we found it more amusing than irritating. 

Also, have to pay for parking outside!"}
{"text":"Went to Bagel House but got caught here by its bright eye-catching RED. \" It's no harm to have some desserts before a bagel\", my adorable devil whispered over my left shoulder.  The decor here is modern and funky.  Guess the red had increased my appetite right away; flipped though the menu and wanted to try everything.  I had \"Surprise Me\" ($12.75) finally.  The presentation was great.  There were three mini crepes wrapped up like a bag with fruits inside; strawberry, banana and pineapple.  Added a junior scoop of gelato for $2.75  The crepes were topped with Belgium chocolate, and I had added an extra shot of dark chocolate to plunge myself to the deepest of sweetness.  The gelato was smooth and so-melt-in-my-mouth! Come here whenever your sweet tooth makes an emergency call for a lusciously treat : )"}
{"text":"Omg the wait time on VDAY was almost one hour. But that isnt their fault really. Its a popular spot for desserts for good reason. The milk chocolate drizzle is to die for here. I wanted to take a bath in it and just drink it all up haha.

The red velvet pancakes were divine, soft and fluffly. The chocolate drizzle and shot were to die for. My date had the Frozen in Time dessert and she loved it so much too. 

Service was quick and efficient as possible given the crowds of people there. I would come again to try everything else. Check in using the yelp app to get 10% off! 5 stars with a return this summer :D"}
{"text":"Full 5 stars. That's right!! What a gem of a place, tucked away on Lakeshore Mississauga, farther away for the hustle-bustle of Port Credit. And tell you what! This place could give Demetre's a run for their money. 

Deets - 

Interiors: super duper cute and colorful and they had Halloween themed decor! Each seating area is different and there's something for everyone - corner seating for two people, perfect for dates; cozy sofas for a group of friends, and dining seating for families. Did I make the place sound big? It's actually really small... but it's nice to see how neatly they have arranged for everything. Also, the bathrooms are AMAZING! 

Ambience: The place is lively, yet cozy and homely. I actually like that a lot about this little spot.

Crowd: A little bit of every kind... 

Orders: I had 3 soft baked cookies with belgium dark chocolate drizzled on top. And a scoop of the most orgasmic chocolate icecream. My boyfriend got some waffle dessert that looked just as good. The portions are huge and you can totally share... we didn't because I am kind of a chocoholic and he likes some berry options! 

Menu: There's something for everyone and it's all very reasonably priced. They offer their Belgian chocolate on everything... but if you want something healthier, you could order fruits on a kebab stick with chocolate. 

I really don't want this place to close down... so if you are reading this review, do check out this place! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Came here once with two other friends and upon entering the place was nicely decorated and gave some good first impressions. Once we opened the menu, we noticed how expensive all the desserts were? So we decided to get the fondue platter and just split it between each other, still came to about $16-20 pp depending plus tip. Overall, the fondue was subpar and the \"star\" which would be the chocolate was extremely underwhelming and very watery ?? Fruits were good but for the price it just didn't make sense. Really cool concept but execution did not deliver! Also, the service was not that great either. Overall, I would not come back to this place unfortunately- would recommend demetres or cacao 70 for fondue (which is now open in rhill!)."}
{"text":"This place looks like Cupid's condo - it's like Valentine's Day threw up in here, but you don't necessarily have to be here for a date! From the kitschy, charming decor, to the funky yet comfortable chairs, to the chocolate fountains, what an adorable café with both a fun and/or romantic vibe, take your pick. It's a great place for a date, a hang-out with friends, or a dessert stop for the family - this is the type of spot that welcomes all types of groups for whatever occasion, which I love. 

We arrived on a Sunday evening around 6:00 PM looking for a dessert stop, and the place was packed! Luckily, they had a table for 2 by the window and we were seated right away. We ordered: a fruit crepe drizzled in different types of chocolate sauce (I believe this is their Dunk 'N Dip special) and the Frozen In Time - an actual jar with frozen goodies, ice cream, and delicious chocolate sauce. It was absolutely delicious - super sweet, but exactly what we came in here for. 

The menu has lots of variety, so whether you're looking for something sweet or savoury, chances are, you'll find something that'll satisfying your cravings here. 

For two people, with tax and tip, our total came to a little less than $28."}
{"text":"I went here for a dessert date with my hubby. The restaurant was jam packedddd on a Sunday early afternoon! The decor is lovely. Loved the chocolate fountains. The servers were polite and friendly. 

We ordered a Belgium hot chocolate with multi coloured marshmallows, and a Brownie Crepe. I think the hotchocolate would've been way better with just whip cream or plain marshmallows. The multi colored ones gave it an odd taste. Now people, if you love chocolate and have a serious sweet tooth... This is your kinda place for their crepes. I lovvvveee chocolate but even this crepe was wayyyy too much chocolate for me. I did like the fact that there were large pieces of brownie inside my crepe. Again... Too much chocolate though. I don't think we'll be back. Nothing really wowed me."}
{"text":"This was our first visit at Dunk'n Dip, but a series of unfortunate events left me hesitating to come back.

Food 1/5
----------
We were excited to try their gelato because the photos I saw looked incredible and creative. I'm a big fan of cookies 'n cream, but due to popular demand, they had very little left and wasn't planning to bring out a new batch. They did have a new batch of pistachio flavour gelato so I'd be satisfied with that. After exploring the menu, I was going to settle for the their \"Fell In Love\" which is a waffle cone with fresh fruits with a scoop of gelato all on one plate. Sounds delicious! Well, my sweet tooth quickly became salty when the waitress informed us that their gelato refrigerator wasn't working and any gelato on the menu were unavailable, Bummer! We came here wanting to try their gelato too.  We were definitely disappointed, but in our attempt to be optimistic, we went for their hot drinks. We ordered their Cafe Mocha and their Hawaiian Breeze which is hot chocolate using Belgium chocolate, coconut syrup garnished with toasted coconut shavings. Well, just when we thought nothing else can go wrong, the waitress melted our smile away and told us they ran out of coconut syrup. Really? Doesn't that pretty much defeat the purpose of this drink? We were offered for an up-size or waffle bits in the drink with no extra cost. We settled for the waffle bits. 

The Cafe Mocha tasted bland, I honestly couldn't taste any caffeine. Whip cream was surprisingly tasty and I normally don't like it. The Belgium hot chocolate was tasteless. It wasn't sweet at all and it tasted like chocolate powder mixed with hot water. If there was anything positive about the drink, it was the waffle bits which tasted pretty good in the drink. 

Service 2/5 
----------
The waitress that served us was friendly and did offer us the waffle bits to the Belgium hot chocolate when they ran out of coconut syrup. The place have a lamp that you can turn on when you want the waitress to come over. I found it pretty neat and thought it was effective. Well, the light was on for about 10 minutes before the waitress came over (it wasn't busy either). Guess I was wrong. She also offered us water, but it never came. Overall, the service could have been better.

Atmosphere 3/5
----------
The place looks clean and modern. I really liked how they display their dessert, especially the chocolate fondue. It looked like they had limited seats for big groups, so prepare to wait if it gets busy. We were seated next to the door, so it was distracting when customers came in. 

Overall, Dunk'n Dip left us feeling disappointed when we left. No gelato available, tasteless hot chocolate, and a lack of service made us question if we should give this a second chance. 

~Heads up~ we came here last Thursday and we overheard that it might take up to a week for them to fix the gelato refrigerator."}
{"text":"I've been to dunk n' dip at this location before, but I Came here tonight with a few buddies as I thought I would give it a try again since there is new management there now. All I have to say is what average to me before was now awesome. Noticeable difference in the items and quality of the food I personally ordered the Dunk n dip club sandwich, D-licious. Service was on point and took care of us. Will definately come back here again to try different stuff, the dessert looked very tempting but i managed to control my sweet tooth tonight but I did notice new flavors I will definitely try. Forget plain old jane Demetres, this is the place to be

5/5 easily tonight"}
{"text":"I wish I'd read the reviews before coming here. The ambience and decor is nice, desserts are just ok. This place is VERY pricey, average $20 for each item. We tried the waffle burger, the burger patties were dry and over cooked, but worst of all, it seems they used Eggo waffles! We also got the Lovers dream, a dessert advertised as waffles with fruits and 2 scoops of ice cream. The 2 tiny quarters of waffles in the dessert were at least made in house, but I had asked for 2 different flavours of ice cream, instead both scoops were the same flavour. The servers are nice, but they kept forgetting to bring us cutlery. Overall I don't think the price is worth the food here. Other dessert places charge way less for the same things."}
{"text":"After commencing my journey for an everyday English \"cabane a sucre\", I visited Hollywood Cone in Oshawa and then finally decided to give Dunk'N Dip in Port Credit a try. I actually decided to give it a try after driving by the new location near Square One in Mississauga.

The reviews for this place must be based on the decadence of sweet desserts and not on the overall quality of the food. Yes the interior is modern and charming with small table lamps that you touch to light up and get service. The food offerings consist basically of anything you would dip, dunk or pour chocolate onto. In short, a very expensive chocolate fondue. The makings of this place include a waffle maker, an espresso machine, three chocolate fountains, a gelato counter and a sandwich press. 

My review is favorable because we were able to get a table for four, for just two of us and we felt comfortable hanging around the sweet smell of chocolate. If two of us had to jam into a packed room, I don't think our experience would have been as great. As for the prices, they are a little high at $5.65 for a cappuccino that was on the very small side and some fruit skewers and chocolate that were close to $11.00 each. And while taking orders on cute little mini iPads seems very contemporary, having the waitress ask what we had (because of a system failure), and providing us with hand-written receipts made the check out process longer than normal. Or perhaps it was the pound of sugar we just had that tested our restlessness.

I would recommend Dank 'N Dip at least once. And would recommend going at at time when it's not so busy. From the looks of both Square One and Port Credit, I still prefer the latter. However I heard they also just opened in Milton. Sweet!"}
{"text":"This place is a blessing especially for those who follow a Halal diet. I've gone here for a couple of years and have yet to be disappointed by the taste and quality of the food. This time around, my guests tried both of the bread bowls (veal steak & chicken) and I had the Montreal style crepes with a side of homefries. Portions are generous and we couldn't be happier.

For dessert, we had the chocolate brownie crepe (a fan-favourite); next time, I'll be sure to try the tiramisu cheesecake which sounds divine.

Just a quick warning, the restaurant opens at 2:00pm not 12:00pm (weekdays) like it says online; unfortunately, we found out the hard way, but came back anyway."}
{"text":"Great dessert place.. and the chocolate fountain looks so inviting! we shared dessert, portions were quite decadent! The dark chocolate brownie was amazing, as was the cheesecake we ordered. Service was good, long wait on Friday if you walk in, so make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Great location at Lakeshore, now a new one at Burnhamthorpe Rd W. The menu has a large variety of items, however it's a little on the pricier side. The desserts are all very similar, either a brownie, crepe, or waffle with a topping of some sort and the usual melted chocolate from the chocolate fountains. Also, they have a dessert with four two bite brownies and charge a lot for it. The ambience is warm, cosy, and laid back. Overall a good cafe. The tiramisu cheesecake and the waffle covered with marshmallows was my favourite."}
{"text":"The concept and atmosphere of this restaurant is cute. It kind of reminds me of the comic Archie, where the gang would go hang out for some milkshakes and burgers. 

We were craving for some crepes. And this was the only place that was opened late on a Sunday.   We ordered a sweet crepe, with bananas, strawberries and your choice of Belgium dark, milk or white chocolate. We ordered it with the milk chocolate.  The whole thing was just ok. I thought it was overpriced too. 

They do offer other options for desserts, like waffles, cakes, and even french macaroons. As well as a savory menu.  But, overall experience was just ok."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for a change because we always go to demetres and love it. Our meal was small for how much we paid and the fact that we had to pay extra for gelato was even more ridiculous. I told the waitress that we did not enjoy it at all (even though it was obvious because most was left on our plate), but she just said oh and if we wanted the bill. I can tell many people like it, but in my opinon if you see a customer isn't satisfied you do something and that was not don't. Definitely will not come back because it's more tastier and you get double the food for cheaper at demetres!"}
{"text":"Ok - this place is definitely not OMGEE you gotta check this place out. 

The desserts are better than the savory food. 

Soup is a bit watery and doesn't taste particularly good - just salty and not much else. The soup bread bowl comes with either a soda or an americano - no subbing for tea. The americano is ok - decent, but not stand out. 

Desserts are the winners here, but pricey. Expect most of the dessert plates to check in around $20 before taxes - they are big enough to split between two people. I would recommend sharing to avoid a sugar overload. 

Service is a bit weird though and definitely hit or miss. The staff is nice and they come by and clean up the table often. However, some servers seem more confused than others.  

Overall, Yeah, just ok - the pricing is more expensive than Cafe Demetre - however I am not really sure if it is worth the price premium and the weird service."}
{"text":"Service - great! Friendly staff and server, who was also willing to review the menu items with us. 

Venue - two tables outside; inside is a bit tight on space, but vibrant decorated and ambiance is nice. 

Food - we only got the waffles, which I felt were undercooked and were still sticky in the middle. Weren't anything special and neither was the chocolate. I found the menu to be priced well above average compared to similar venues, and the items were much too sweet with an overwhelmingly large amount of chocolate. 

On the plus side, they did have interesting non-dairy (vegan) sorbets, and while intrigued with the blueberry basil, I found the texture to be a bit off putting (and really unattractive to eat as I realized later on I had basil stuck on my tooth) lol"}
{"text":"Chocolate, coffee, tea, dessert, chocolate, if you like any or all of these things then you need to check out Dunk'n dip. This place is like a smaller Willy Wonka Factory without the crazy snacks and you don't need a golden ticket to get in. I had the cream of broccoli in a breaded bowl soup which was pretty good, but I was hoping that the soup would have been a bit warmer. Also, all of their main courses come with a free coffee, but they don't have anyway to upgrade from the coffee to a tea. Saying that, I tried some of their tea and it is worth the additional money. We finished off our me with the dessert \"surprise me\" which is 3 crepes stuffed with either fruit, brownie or strawberries and cream, plus you get chocolate to cover all over it. Please forgive me that their is no photo of the dessert, but when it came out all I did was start eating. 

Oh yeah they give 10% off to Yelpers. 

Definitely recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, enjoyable ambience and atmosphere and the ice cream was delicious but the prices are too expensive for what it is. 

Would come back and order the jumbo jumbo again but the crepes, waffles, plain waffle cone and ice cream with fruit are so overpriced. Would rather go to Demetres or Spin desserts for those items. They also don't have any tea lattes (London fog) and wasn't impressed by their drink menu."}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to meet up with my friend for desert. It was my first time trying this place and I have to say I wasn't realy impressed. I decided to try this place because of the high Yelp rating and I have to say I was a bit disappointed with my experience.  When I first walked into the place,  I got seated and the server at the time was very helpful in helping my friend and I with our order.  However, beyond that point it started going downhill. The desert wasn't that good and the prices were pricy. I have been to other desert places that had cheaper prices and better deserts. What I didn't really like was the constant asking from one of the servers whether we wanted to pack our food or whether we were done. It made me feel as if I was being rushed out of there. Overall, I was expecting a relaxed desert experience. But what I got was a so so desert dish and a feeling of being rushed out of the place.  I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"Totalllyyyyyyyyy loveeeeeed it !!! Been to Canada twice and I can't miss visiting this place. Everything I have tried here is just amazing . The food , ambience. Loved every bit of it. Best part is that they server halal. Please open up your branch in US ny/ nj . There's not much halal good options like these in US, with great ambience.Keep it up !"}
{"text":"A cute little spot on Lakeshore Rd that gives you a red carpet entrance. When you arrive, you know you're there. The interior is super cute and the option of sitting in the front (more for a quick bite or small dessert) or in the back (more comfortable chairs and more of a sit-in feel) gives it that option of \"getting something light\" or \"dinner and dessert\". I thought it was strictly dessert on the menu, but there were many savoury crepe options and full meals as well. I got hungry after reading through the menu and ended up getting a waffle burger and home fries. I did end up taking a chocolate shot (melted Belgian chocolate in a shot glass). The staff also were very friendly and allowed our table of 3 to try every flavour of gelato before placing our order. Great food, layout, decor, staff, menu, variety and all-round great experience. I want to go back soon."}
{"text":"Nice live jazz musician. Good European-style desert crepes. Will be back there when in Port-Credit again."}
{"text":"We had dessert here on a Friday night after seeing this place in and around Mississauga... I have a major sweet tooth so was super excited to try this place.

Upon entering.. you are seated at a table with all custom-branded products..from little boards for your utensils..to the salt & pepper shakers.. to the plates. Everything in here is nicely themed red, white and black. The décor is very modern and IKEA-esque.

There are lights on the tables that you are supposed to tap for service.. not quite sure what the point of this was as it is quicker to just flag someone down.

I ordered the Jumbo Fambo ($22) to share with my husband and our initial thoughts upon looking at the menu was.. wow these desserts are EXPENSIVE. Aside from the price, the dessert was really good and very sweet/filling.. definitely a cheat-day kind of dessert.

Overall, I don't think I'd come back here as the menu prices are extremely high (probably to fund all those unnecessary custom print utensils and lights they have, lol). I'll be sticking to Demetres or Spin!"}

{"text":"The desserts we ordered are pancake with berries and a chocolate fondue. But neither of them tastes good. They are way too sweet and taste bland. I do not think so it worth the price. I would rather go to demetres for desserts next time."}
{"text":"My son insisted on going to dunkndip, so we went to Lake shore location. We got parking just in front of the place so that was good.  Nice comfy looking place.  The servers were okay, not very welcoming.  Our server gave us the menus and said to tap the center piece which would light up indicating that were are ready to order. That was a cool concept. I haven't seen that before.

The names on the menu items are unique and eye catching.  You will find dessert names like a piece from Heaven, love me tender earthquake in heaven - just to name a few.

We ordered the dunkndip specialty, which came with a crepe filled with different fruits drizzled with chocolate, it was tasty and fresh. We also ordered Back to the future, this was like 3 tiny waffles with dark chocolate drizzle with pieces of brownie, it wasn't so tasty, and velvet cake. I found that this dish was not fresh."}
{"text":"We both had the waffles but with different toppings, one with brownies and the other with strawberries. I tried both dishes and absolutely loved them. Will be trying the crepes the next time I'm here!"}
{"text":"Chocolate heaven! Chocolate on everything! I had the Godiva chocolate cake and it was amazing! The covered it it chocolate and I was in my happy place, they have 3 or 4 different chocolate fountains and they can dip anything in chocolate and they have a wide range of items for your to chose from. For obvious sanitation reasons you can't actually touch the fountains yourself. Thank god cause I can see that going horribly wrong when some idiot decides they're gonna stick their hand in it ( let's be honest there's a lot of stupid people) so to avoid that issue the staff logically made the fountains away from the reach of the germ public!

The staff is friendly and serves you quickly, then hand you a menu with has all the chocolaty goodness they serve on it! The place has the coolest decor and makes me feel like I'm in Charlie and the chocolate factory! Also super cool the way they give you the hand towel!!!  It's one of those expanding ones and they do it right at your table extremely willy wonka-ish love this place will return soon!"}
{"text":"We ordered the cafe mocha, Snow White waffle and the dunk n dip crepe. 

Ahhhh all of it was absolutely amazing. Service was incredible and the the decor and atmosphere made it feel like we weren't even in Toronto! 

Go just go."}
{"text":"Can't begin to describe how much of a hidden gem this place is. Absolutely fantastic display of dessert on a  plate; no matter what you order, and the taste is nothing short of the way it looks...delicious."}
{"text":"Horrible service, I walked in and placed an order twice for gelato to go. The lady said \"OK\" twice and didn't get me anything.  Literally stood there like an idiot for 25 mins.  What the hell is this crap? First time here, never coming here again."}
{"text":"Even though I've read enough supporting reviews/participation in Yelp events, for some reason, I've been hesitating to go to Dunk'n Dip.  Possible reasons:  I don't like frequenting places like Demetre's, I prefer pastries/ethnic cafés, and aside from the chocolate fountains, I didn't know what Dunk'n Dip was all about.

(Well, if like me, you're wondering the same thing, just check out the menu - it'll give you a better idea!)

Dunk'n Dip features some soups, salads, wraps, 'n sandwiches + of course desserts such as crepes, cheesecake, waffles, slices of cake, cookies, mousse, gelato, & caffeinated drinks/tea.  As per the name, some of these sweets are dunked, dipped, &/or drizzled in your choice of white, milk, or dark chocolate!

The goodies from Dunk'n Dip is partially made in-house as well as imported from places like Cheesecake Factory for their cheesecakes.  As per the server, other stuff that's brought in are the gelato and coffee is Lavazza.

I had a trio of 3 small mousses that I was able to choose the flavours.  It was just under $6 and out of raspberry, mango, & white chocolate, the white chocolate was my least favourite because it was more of a foam, i.e. it didn't set properly.  Raspberry and especially mango were nice!

If you are looking for a non-chain dessert place that makes most of their decadent sweets AND is open late, this place is for you!

Tip:  Unless you have a huge sweet tooth/appetite, MOST if not all of the desserts should be shared.  The plate of 3 mousses was a bit much for me, so I should've just gotten that...to share!"}
{"text":"Great concept but bad execution.  4 of 4 orders wrong, had to ask for water several times. Chocolate, gelato and brownie is not great quality and the fruit was not great either.  The manger or owner was just lurking around making us feel uncomfortable.  Seat was sinking in.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Heard lots of rave reviews and the place was definitely cute. I had hot chocolate which was amazing but to be honest most things on the menu didn't pique my interest. It seemed like a lot of the same flavours and combos over and over again."}
{"text":"Awful. I'm sorry to write this negative review but it was just a gong show. To summarize, we were here for two hours and after waiting over an hour for my food, I left without eating. We had five people at our table and ordered some main and dessert dishes. In total we had 6 dishes at the table which included 2 mains (turkey club, veggie wrap), 1 side (potatoes) and 3 desserts. Here are the main problems we had:


- drinks took more than 30 mins (3 cans of pop and 2 teas). One person's tea took an extra 15 min.
- two tables beside us who arrived at least 45 minutes after our order was placed received their food before us 
- our food took well over an hour to arrive after ordering.
- once some of us finally started to receive food, my order was missing items which I noticed had been substituted with other things. I honestly thought they gave me someone else's plate. I called the waitress back to ask and she came back and said that was the dish I ordered but unfortunately they'd run out of some of the ingredients. I just sent the entire dish back because it wasn't even what I had ordered from the menu anymore and I had lost my appetite with the wait.
- one person was still waiting for a side of potatoes which finally arrived 20 mins after others had started eating
- one dessert was still missing 15 mins after that... We had to remind them and my friend just asked for it to go since we were frustrated 
- when my friend arrived home, her dessert order was missing items.

Also it is overpriced here. $18 for a wrap with a salad inside?!"}
{"text":"This place is a prime example of why it's a horrible decision to hire teenage girls as the majority of your staff. Rude, unenthusiastic, and extremely passive service. The workers seemed to talk amongst themselves as if they were gossiping at a slumber party. Absolutely nothing special about anything on the menu. If spending $20 on a waffle with chocolate drizzle is your idea of fun, this is definitely the place for you...You can probably make similar food at home that tastes much better."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night after reading all the rave reviews. Glad we did.
Be warned the place fills up fast. You may be waiting a few minutes to get in but its well worth it. 
It's easily the best dessert cafe in town."}
{"text":"SECOND VISIT 

Came here again to give the place another try. However the service I received is still the same. The waitress here provide horrible service. Besides getting my order wrong they are still very disorganized. One thing that bothered me the most is the fact that when we were ready to pay the lady comes and cashes my friend out and then tells us that she will be back. But she ends up going to the other table to let them pay for their bill.. like how can you just leave to cash someone else out when you're not even done with cashing out one table. That's very rude and people don't have time for you to partially do things and make them wait ... We asked for the bill first and when you started servicing us you should've finished our table and then go on and do whatever you need. But even after she finished cashing the other table out she didn't come back to let us finish paying. We had to call her over again. Horrible experience ever. 

Never coming back. Avoid this location. Go to Port Credit!"}
{"text":"Been getting visiting this dessert place over the years. It's been my favourite. However, my most recent visit surprised me. Service and quality declined.  

Ordering the desserts off the menu was simple. However, selecting the gelato was difficult because they no longer label their gelato in the display. You would not know which flavours are which. 

The dessert was as usually good. The waffles were soft and the gelato was delicious. But the problem is that they did not give you any forks for the waffles and crepes. Or any tissue.

Presentation wise, the desserts are pretty poorly presented. They aren't as nice as they used to be. 

The coffee was decent. But pricey. However, the tea costed $5 and the quality was so poor. I'm paying a high price for tea and my cup of tea comes with a broken tea bag. All the tea leaves were floating on the top. I informed the waiter about the tea leaves and she said the tea is supposed to be like that. I suppose I'm supposed to drink the tea leaves too right... ? Because that's how we drink tea.. I asked her for something to drain the tea leaves she said they don't have anything that could do that. All she can offer me is a new cup of hot water... Hot water... not even a new cup of tea. When I moved my tea bag over to the new cup of water. The tea bag already lost flavour, the tea pretty much tasted like nothing. I had to also hold the broken tea bag up to prevent the tea leaves from going into the new cup. 

I mean like this is extremely poor service. I'm paying $5 for a cup of tea. That's not cheap. The least you can offer is a new cup of tea with a new tea bag...... not just hot water. 

Typical pricing. The place is pricey. The bill came up to about $60 for two desserts, 2 coffees and 1 tea. 

Dessert is still okay but will not recommend ordering the teas. Service is pretty slow and bad though..."}
{"text":"Delicious food, amazing desert and wonderful service. I will go back for sure. It is a little pricy, but worth it. Good for date, and friendly meeting."}
{"text":"Was looking for dessert place In mississauga other than the usual marble slab, bubble tea etc and decided to try this place with a friend. 

First off the interior is bright with colors (kinda reminds me of a room in willy wonka). Next, they have a big selection in their menu. For instance, under their hot chocolate I got one called \"American marshemellow\". Was very rich/sweet, but nothing that great. I followed that up with an ice cream and waffles. My friend has a pistachio ice cream (very plain looking) and a macaron and tea set. Her experience wasn't too great. The ice cream was plain, the tea presentation was good but the tea again was meh (this tea option was actually pricey) n the macaron did not have the lightness to it.

We came around 3 ish in the afternoon. There wasnt any other customers so we didn't know why the prep time was longer than normal. 

I have mixed feelings about this place. Although taste wide my experience was decent,  i can't say the same for my friend. If you are in the neighborhood n really want sweets (or want to click it off your bucket list) then sure try it."}
{"text":"Great idea but very disappointed in service and quality of the deserts mostly store bought toppings not like described freshly made"}
{"text":"One of my friends recommended this place so I was excited to try another dessert place.

Price Range (Not including Taxes and TIp): Desserts were about $7-$15. Meals were about $12-$20. The dinner stuff seemed more expensive than at similar places. Desserts I would say were a bit more expensive for what you got compared to others. 

Food Quality (Taste, Serving Size, Menu): 4/5
I had the Krispy Crunch and the Crispy Pearl. I definitely ordered way too much, 1 of the two would have been fine. I really like the Crispy Pearl, it's pretty much a hot chocolate. It tasted rich, though I expected it to be a bit bigger for how much I paid. The Krispy Crunch though it tasted good and was unique, it was hard to eat and kind of a struggle. They have a pretty large menu full of a lot of food, dessert and drink options. 

Atmosphere : 5/5
I really loved the design of this place. The decorations were amazing, they had a lot of dessert themed items around the store. It had a nice modern look. It's not overly big, so I'd recommend a smaller group of 4 or less. It's in Port Credit so the parking is just street parking which is free after 9pm on weekdays. 

Service: 4/5
The person that service was really nice and even laughed at my friend's lame jokes. They have this lamp thing that you click to let them know you're ready which I thought was pretty cool. The food came at a reasonable time and they came to check if our meal was good or if we needed more water once in a while. 

Would I go again?
I would, going to order only 1 dessert next time. 

Lash's Recommendations 
Crispy Pearl - If you're into hot chocolate with a few extras, this is your drink!"}
{"text":"The almond gelato is so good! I love that there is chocolate on almost everything. I think that this place has great potential, but they need a bigger space. The atmosphere is nice, and the decor is cute, but the seating and being too close to other people is uncomfortable. However, I do plan on making it a regular choice for dessert."}
{"text":"The place is halal. 

The service was more than excellent. The Belgian chocolate was quality stuff! I sometimes times order one of the desserts to go. I put the liquid chocolate rice krispy and marshmallow dessert in the fridge to get cold and it becomes a solid dessert I can break into chunks and eat over a day or two.

Dunk N Dip is a fun n cafes with lots of different cool and interesting eats, from bread soup bowls to waffle burgers. They have such attention to detail by the way that the plate your food, the containers they serve the food in and the decor. They also have a light that they put on your table so you don't have to keep waiting for the waiters' attention; when they see the light on they just come.

The setting was beautiful, the bathroom was clean, and the menu options were plentiful. 

The desserts are so cool. I would totally return."}
{"text":"My friends and I chose to go here for our monthly night out, hoping to get something unique and fun to eat. On a scorching weekday night, we occupied the only 2 patio tables and scoured the menu for something amazing.

The menu is large and does offer quite a bit in terms of savoury. Surprisingly, we all went for a sandwich. 3 out of 4 of us got the waffle sandwich, and we were not impressed. Waffles were very much Eggo in style. Nothing fancy or unique there.The accompanying \"salad\" was confusing with a strange taste. When asked, even the waitress was unsure how to describe it. She said it is \"sort of a coleslaw\". The only redeeming factor on the plate was the fried potatoes in a waffle cup. But its pretty hard to screw up deep fried potatoes.

The 4th in our group got a crepe sandwich which she described as \"a salad in a crepe\". Again, not what she was hoping for either.

We did finish our meal with a scoop of ice cream. We all had different flavours, and they were amazing. So, despite my mediocre rating, I will be giving this place a second chance. Next time, it will be for dessert. It seems like they do that better than savoury."}
{"text":"Our experience was nice until we found a bunch of ants in our chocolate fondu plate. They were in the marshmallows and were crawling all over the place. We possibly are some as we didn't notice until all the fruits were eaten. No apologies from staff however they did take the platter off our bill."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed in my visit to Dunk'n Dip. The service was good and everyone was really nice but the highlight of my meal was my tea. I think it was lychee flavour. I really do love tea but back to the food. Both of my friends ordered a wrap and it was BLAND. Man oh man, you should of seen how happy I was that I did not waste my money on that. I was considering ordering food and dessert and decided to order dessert and eat of my friends plate. I didn't even end up eating off their plates because the wraps sucked. I ordered the surprise me crepes. Three crepes filled with surprises! I loved the concept but not the execution. One was filled with strawberries (delicious) , brownies and profiteroles. Filling a crepe with a carb is too much. It's really dry and sticks to your mouth. They serve it with a side of Belgium chocolate to drizzle on top but chocolate inst as moisturizing as syrup or ice cream. The textures just didn't work together. Sadly, I probably wouldn't go  back unless someone else really wanted to try it."}
{"text":"Loved my experience! 

The staff were very pleasant. Seated us and served us promptly. 

We only ordered dessert as we already ate at another restaurant. Ordered the \"Surprise me\" this was a fun experience because you get four crepes that are closed and you have no idea what's inside. We all had fun opening them :) the Hazelnut gelato was deliciouuuuus! Absolutely loved it. Also ordered the cookies n cream milkshake, would've liked mine to be thicker though. The pancakes with the cinnamon on top was very tasty. Also the brownie stuffed crepe was yummy but should be shared because it's crazy sweet. 

Very clean interior, yummy desserts, great service.. highly recommend this one! :)"}
{"text":"Was firing to try this place, we finally did and it was awesome. I got the crepe with all the fruit in it with milk chocolate it was so delicious I didn't want it to end. My bf got jumbo jumbo the gelato was okay we've had better. He wished there was more chocolate on it. I will definitely go again for crepe yummy"}
{"text":"I had the worst experience here. I came to try out this place on a Sunday. This location is severely understaffed and has the worst customer service. The servers are rude and pathetic. They made us wait for our dessert for 25 mins and when we went to ask about it, our server said we should leave. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Depends on what you're here for! Only come for desserts. The meal menu is over priced and the flavour combos can be odd. There is nothing special about the classic menu items. 
The desserts are great but are on the priced side (avg $15-$23). Everything is covered in chocolate from their chocolate fountains. The service is okay. You turn on the light on a lamp to call for service so it's pretty basic. Also no pop refills. 
Will come here for delicious dessert dates to splits but not as a regular."}
{"text":"Always great. Great quality desserts. Fresh fruit, quality chocolate. Great location, even has a patio in the summer. It's very busy do make sure you're prepared to wait a while but it's worth it"}
{"text":"HALAL

We heard about this place a lot from fellow yelpers and finally got to try it out.

This place is amazing! Atmosphere is great. Ambiance is great. Service is friendly. Food is delicious. Portions are large. What more can you ask for? 

We came to this place for a late lunch and it was worth it. We ordered the french onion soup bowl and the club sandwich. Wow! Portions were large! The way the plates were presented and set-up was great and the taste of the food was delicious. 

Then we wanted to try the desserts because we heard so much about them. We got the Surprise Me which is 3 crepes filled with different fillings (a surprise) and drizzled in either dark, milk, or white chocolate. Again, huge dessert plate and it was so hard to finish. But it was delicious! 

Definitely a must-try!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the pearl hot chocolate, the description was amazing and it tasted good . Also the hazelnut gelato was decent but nothing I would crave for. I long for that rich sweet hazelnut Ferraro richer like gelato. There used to be a place on college street in Toronto but that closed down. Anyhow, I also ordered the tiramisu cheesecake. Our server wasn't very good but the more seasoned waiter assisted her and was great at explaining the menu. She helped me pair the cheeecake with the didn't chocolate by describing how the coffee taste would be best paired with a sweet choc, how dark was bitter, milk was sweet, white was very sweet. I really enjoyed the tiramisu cheesecake. I never used to order the cake before however after trying a lot of their crepes I decided this would be the best time to
Try something new. I had a feeling this would be good and my instincts were correct. I wouldn't say there's a lot to be fixed with their crepes but there's definitely
another level they could get to that they have not. House of crepe on queen
St is much better. Had it not been
for my chatty friend I would've complained about how it took 40 mins to get a scoop of gelato, cheesecake, and regular coffee and hot
Chocolate. Was my cheesecake made from
Scratch? I'm
Sick and tired of Ontario restaurants slacking in some ways. Where is the accountability? I have previous serving experience so I know how service should be. You have people in charge who clearly get away with subpar efforts as long
as the seats are filled up. Hate to say it but
I see this location shutting down in another 5 yrs. you don't have a grip on the market, your uniqueness is not enough to overlook the flaws. Their savoury items are decent but if you market yourself as a dessert place you should step it up. This place went from something special to another Demetries. There's no comfort or luxury in this place. Perhaps the newer locations are better."}
{"text":"The Dunk'n Dip Speciality! Wonderful dessert large enough to share. Great service but had to endure a really long wait for a table. I would recommend calling ahead and booking your table so you wait time might be shorter. The staff were very friendly and offered fast service. Nice atmosphere and deco. Loving this place."}
{"text":"The service was great but the food I found was really overpriced. I got 2 mini scoops of gelato - pistachio and strawberry cheesecake, in a cone shaped glass with topped with kiwis, strawberries and white chocolate drizzle for about $15. The pistachio gelato was okay, but the strawberry cheesecake tasted like frozen yogurt with strawberry ripple. My friend got a skewer of fruit with some milk chocolate for dipping and that was about $10. 

For the price, I'd rather dine at another dessert place and get more bang for my buck."}
{"text":"Overpriced vs quality of ice cream. Also badly operated, waited too long to check us out."}
{"text":"Very disorganized 
No one knows what their doing
Waitress kept coming to us asking did you order this??? No we did not??
Very dirty
Dirty cutlery 
Will NOT go back"}
{"text":"My partner and I went when they had just opened for the day. Luckily, we were the first customers and were seated promptly. We ordered a big scoop of salted caramel ice cream and a red velvet cake. However, it was a surprise to us that our order took close to 20 mins to receive it since we were the only ones there. The ice cream scoop melted slightly when it came. I was a little disappointed with the ice cream since the cup it came in made it look bigger than what was actually contained inside. The red velvet was nice, but the icing was slightly too sweet for our liking. Bill came to $30 for a medium scoop of ice cream topped with fruits and a red velvet cake. It wasn't really worth the price or hype, you're basically paying for the food presentation and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Never miss the esclar sticker dipping with the dark/ white chocolate. It tastes so goooood! Nice place to relax and hang out with friends"}
{"text":"My fiance took me here knowing I'm a chocolate fanatic and with high hopes that our experience will be one we can re-experience, but that was not the case. 

Let me start with the service, it was very slow and inattentive. We didn't know who was our server because the girls kept getting switched up. 

The music in this place was horrible. I'm pretty sure it was just the radio blasted to its fullest extent. So irritating.

The prices I felt were very high for a lack of food quality and quantity. The mild collate fondue tasted like an ordinary melted chocolate bar. Nothing distinguishable at all. 

Overall I would not come back due to a lack of service, food, music, and overall atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had a great experience previously, but the most recent visit was a nightmare!

I was bragging not about this spot to a friend who has never had the Dunk N Dip experience, so I had to bring her in to indulge (or so I thought).  We came in and were told we would have to wait 45 mins for a seat, even though there were two tables open I noticed shortly afterwards. I tried to get the attention of one of the servers to point it out. It took another 20min of standing around awkwardly waiting for someone to notice us. Once they gave me the time of day and I pointed out the empty table, I got a \"oh yeah...\" and were told to go sit. Another 20 minutes went by without anyone bringing us water or menus. At this point my friend grabbed the menus herself from their shelf. I had to flag someone down to bring the waters. We ordered a cheesecake slice and a crepe - the sever proceeds to tell us that they ran out of crepe batter and are trying to make another batch which will take at least half hour. Instead she suggests we order a waffle - at this point I was really confused, isn't it practically the same batter?! Anyways sure, we went with the waffle. The cheesecake came and we ate that. We waited and waited and waited for this waffle - a total of another 40 minutes wasted waiting for the waffle she suggested. At this point I walk up to the cash and ask if they forgot about our order. Another server tells me they ran out of batter so they are still trying to get the recipe right.... why the heck did our server recommend waffles in lieu of the crepes if they both came from the same batter, that was unavailable?! At this point I'm P'ed off for them wasting my time and we cancel the outstanding order.  Our table was right up against the kitchen, and for the duration of our experience I've been watching the guy continuously pouring batter and then scraping it off the grill. How after being in business for so long, do they still have problems getting the recipe right for the batter??? It was just nonsense! Needless to say, it seems this place has gone downhill since my first (and wonderful) experience here. I won't be bothering coming here again! Super disappointing!"}
{"text":"A little on the pricier side for dessert, but the portion sizes were huge and the food was delicious.
The decor was lovely and our waitress was lovely. 
Definitely visiting again :)"}
{"text":"Yummy chocolate!!! delicious chicken wrap and the surprise me crepe was a hit! Definitely worth trying :)"}
{"text":"Chocolate is delish! Had the Dunk'n Dip Specialty.. Big portion n def satisfies sweet cravings! Their brownies r also a hit :-) I just found out today that everything is halal including marshmallows yay!"}
{"text":"I have never felt so disappointed and cheated with dessert.

I literally just came home from having dessert from here and really felt the need the write a review so that others are cautioned before coming here. I'm angry, and this made me write my first yelp review - here's why.

I came here because I've been craving dessert and ads for this restaurant kept coming up on my fb feed and I'm a dummy who didn't bother to check reviews before (btw pretty sure those two 5 star reviews below left by men are the owners)

The only good part about this place is the ambiance and that it's nicely lit. Decor is pretty too. From outside, it looked nice (don't be fooled, this place is a catfish). Then when we went in, it went downhill.

SO - my sisters and I ordered the brownie waffle ($16) + creme brulee cheesecake ($12) and they were MINATURE and extremely pricey, which is consistent with other reviewers' feedback. We also wanted the red velvet cheesecake but they were out (running out of dessert at 7pm when the place closes at 12am??). The brownie waffle dessert consisted of 3 small palm-sized waffles with a smooshed piece of brownie (definitely the two bite brownies from walmart) on top. Nothing special. The cheesecake was pathetic, underwhelming, and barely had any creme brulee taste to it. And it's really weird that the server has to ask whether we'd like three types of chocolate drizzle on top of our desserts... like of course, with the price we're paying we want all three drizzles, and how about 3 more waffles while you're at it?!

What's even worse is that at your table there are service lamps where you press it for service. Typically when restaurants have this, they'd have a service bar in the back to indicate which seats have their lights pressed. BUT NO - we realized this is LITERALLY JUST A LAMP (???) and so we had to flag our waitress for our forks, after they served us the cheesecake without forks??? 

For two desserts, the bill came up to $32. Such a huge disappointment. It was pretty busy on a Sunday night too, so I think everyone else was also there for their first time. Do NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Their chocolate is to dive in and to die for. This place is must , had their crepes, sandwiches, waffles and everything is good"}
{"text":"Don't have much of a sweet tooth, but those desserts looked too tempting! A decent variety of meals, desserts and specialty coffees at a very reasonable price (especially with the 10% off when you check-in on Yelp). The red velvet cake tasted a bit stale, seemed like it was sitting there for a while. Besides the AC not working the day I came in (felt like I was in a furnace!) and the disappointing cake, I was pleased overall. I recommend checking this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Ambiance was good. Food is delicious but a bit pricey  
 Wait time was 1:40. The whole 2nd floor was waiting area. It would've been great if the 2nd floor served food as well instead of just being used as waiting area. The demand clearly out weighs the supply. This place has good business potential and it is good if they take advantage of that demand. 
 Limited street parking."}
{"text":"Upon reading the consensus of reviews I was hesitant to write this. If you're looking for a nice quiet date night- turn away.

If you choose to proceed with Dunk'n Dip, I would not recommend going on a Tuesday or Wednesday. On these nights they have live music crammed in to the entrance area. Given the small size of the restaurant, the music prevents you from being able to hear the people you are with, and frankly gave me a headache. 

We ordered 2 cappuccinos, which contained 2 teaspoons of coffee and a whole lot of foam. The gelato with soggy waffle bits was unsatisfying, the chocolate served with it tasted stale. I really wanted to like this place, but it came up really short."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is a must visit location. The food is great, the serving sizes are great, and the vibe and look of the place is so nice! Really love it. There's even a waiting spot upstairs, that's the best part lol it's like a little apartment. Really cool. We did have to wait 1.5ish hours the first time we went... it was annoying obviously but like I said there's nice couches and they bring free snacks and drinks to enjoy while waiting so that was actually great! The menu selection is large, but the prices really are... yikes. You're paying around $60+ for 2 peoples, no less but definitely more. Lol oh well I would definitely visit back again. Oh and the customer service is great!"}
{"text":"Food: nice idea w the whole chocolate fondue thing but delivery was just okay. The dark chocolate wasnt good. The milk chocolate wasnt all that special. Nice presentation though. Fresh fruits. Not sure if I am rushing to come back for more. The crepes was good but honestly go easy on the chocolate sauce. Put it on a side and let people pour it over the crepes. It was more like chocolate soup aka diabetic in a cup and a dabble of crepes and ice cream. 

Atmosphere: nice. Lovely waiting lounge. Tables too close to other people though so lacks privacy. Good music. Nice decor. Modern. Clean.

Price: typical. Similar to demetre. Not expensive.

Service: stellar. Our waitress was nice and so was the hostess."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat dessert in Canada by far this place has all the dessert a person can crave for from their mysterious cake to multiple flavor icecream. You can make the dessert extra sweet or mild sweet. Of course, the popular the popular items are the cheese and chocolate dip, but I like crepe with brownie the most. Also, I love the inside decor, which is all decorated with all  cakes and candies! I heard Dukin dip is halal, although I haven't had the chance to eat from their halal menu. Cannot wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are usually doing nothing on a Friday night so I decided to plan a little outing. I've never heard of Dunk'n Dip but when I saw the high ratings for this dessert place I decided that we would go here.

There is only paid street parking in front of the dessert cafe so we parked a few blocks away and walked over. There's a small lot with free parking for 15 hours beside the organic food store.

Dunk'n Dip is a very cute and small cafe that would be great for date nights and small group outings. There are plenty of things to look at while you're there, such as: the chocolate fountains, the teas on display, and the Halloween decorations. Service was good at the beginning but kind of so-so by the time we called for our bill. It took a lot of waving down and eye contact to get the bill brought to our table. 

That night we shared a red velvet cheesecake and he got a tall espresso. The cheesecake was delicious! It was the perfect size because it wasn't too big or too small. Just the right size to share with one other person. My boyfriend enjoyed his espresso and it also came with a cute tiny cookie on the side.

If you're not into sweets that much they also offer actual food there, such as: salads, sandwiches, crepes, and soups.

I would definitely choose Dunk'n Dip over Demetres because the portions are not as  ginormous and the atmosphere is nice and cozy."}
{"text":"Excellent desert. I ordered Snow White waffles with vanilla chocolate. The service was great too. Must visit place for summer 2014."}
{"text":"beef steak waffle sandwich.  TBH the food is very overpriced and bland. the beef and chicken waffle sandwhiches had no flavour.  soggy and poorly constructed waffles were falling apart as I struggled to take one bite. the ambience however is gorgeous. just wish the food taste matched the atmosphere and presentation."}
