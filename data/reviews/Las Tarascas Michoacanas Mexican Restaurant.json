{"text":"The food was delicious and fresh. The salsa and bean dip was great. The fideo soup was like home made. The waiter was kind and polite. The only thing that's was not too good was the coffee. It was cold. The prices are OK. Good place for some good mexican food."}
{"text":"Do not pass this one by.   What a pleasant surprise.   The food was absolutely outstanding.   The only thing that could top the food was the service.   It is a family owned establishment and you can certainly feel the pride this restaurant has in delivering a fantastic dining experience.   We will be regulars here."}
{"text":"The food was great. The beer was extremely cold. That's it I'm sold. Ask for Viri she was amazing Thanks"}
{"text":"Second time  here and I would have to say i am definitely coming back for more. Super friendly service and very nice decor, makes me feel like I'm at my grandmas house. I enjoyed a specialty cocktail called la Michoacana, the perfect combination of sweet sour and alcohol. Then queso fundido came out sizzling and tasted just as
Good as it looked. Next table side presentation of ceviche made just the way you like it. Finally my entree of chicken fajitas did not disappoint, I heard my plate sizzling across the room made for an exciting reveal. Very good! my new go to place for Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to take a minute and review this place! Great clean atmosphere. Hard to find good authentic mexican retaurants around the east side. Staff is always friendly and very attentive. Prices are very reasonable and food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a group of 5. The options were plentiful and a great price/value. The staff was very friendly and attentive. You would never know from the outside how great it is. Don't just drive by! Stop by and try this delicious Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how bad the food is. The place looks nice and the staff is friendly, but the food was the worst of my entire life. The salsa was very bitter and not edible. The soup was store bought alphabet soup, not anything remotely Mexican. The queso was just melted and charred onto a skillet and was very rubbery, so you cannot even eat it with chips. The cheese enchilada had more tortilla than cheese, the wrong kind of cheese, and the sauce almost made me gag. The tamale had store bought bland tomato sauce on top and just tasted bad. We will NEVER go back, and please do not be deceived by the new appearance and good staff."}
{"text":"I worder to go. Overall I think the hostess should work a little better on customer service. Food was okay expected more Mexican flavors... was a little Americanized. I will go and dine soon."}
{"text":"Great service.  Tasty, authentic food.  Yummy complimentary appetizers.  Delicious margaritas!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple of times but the last time I was here really stood out to me and will make me a local for this Mexican joint. We came here a week after my girlfriend's birthday. I ordered my girl one of those bomb mango margaritas...frickin delicious! But as we were finishing up all the employees, cooks included came out of the back and sang happy birthday to my girlfriend! Mind you I didn't even tell them it was her birthday. They must have noticed the date on the ID when checking her age. They got her a churro cake and a shot of tequila on the house!! We were both blown away and had me cracking up the way they made her take the shot! Lol love the crew here. Family owned local restaurant check them out!"}
{"text":"You know?..there are plenty Mexican restaurants in town, but every now and then you you run into one that totally stands out from all the others and lucky for me this is the case with Las Tarascas Michoacanas. The food is amazingly good!
 The place is nice and clean with minimal decorations and although it lacks some more Mexican colors, the arches on the wall are a nice touch giving it a feel of authenticity.
 Service was great, this is a family owned restaurant and they really make you feel like you are part of it. They constantly check on you to refill your beverages and to make sure you're enjoying your meal to the fullest.
I ordered the gallina Zamorana, thats chicken covered with a special strawberry sauce and mushrooms, something I never had before and it was delicious, specially with the freshly handmade tortillas. We also tried the enchiladas Doña Andrea and we loved them but let me warn you, this are authentic Mexican enchiladas and not the ones most people are accustomed to here on the states, so if you're a \"green grow\", I recommend you try the regular enchiladas.
We really had a great time here at Las Tarascascas, ask for Viri (I think that was her name) she will definitely take good care of you! I can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu that sounded delicious, the only bad part is that I live so far from this place, but as my friend would say..... I usually don't hang around on this side of town but when I do I eat at Las Tarascas Michoacanas.....don't stay hungry my friends..
try them!

It's  an alcoholic beverage, comprised of mango, lime and a couple other fruits and tequila."}
{"text":"TBH I was a little skeptical to go to this place, my wife had to drag us based on the Yelp reviews. Once we arrived for lunch, I kind of liked this place when got inside, cozy, clean, decorated authentic mexican. They brought us the best chips, salsa and beans u can get. Then we got some awesome appetizers and then the main dishes which were also great. All authentic, you feel like you wanna plan for a trip to Mexico while eating."}
{"text":"Cannot speak highly enough of this restaurant. Practically right outside the gates of Nellis, it's a gem in the rough. Wonderful service, polite waitstaff, outstanding value, live music, great portion size. How could you ask for more? Try it out! We'll be back."}

{"text":"I have known Lalo Castaneda de owner of Las Tarascas Michiacanas for over 20 years, he has worked in several other great Mexican restaurants in the past and has always taken care of us, the food he prepares us excellent and the service is always first class, this new restaurant he opened last year is with out a question his best yet."}
{"text":"Amazing service,  amazing food, great place to hang out with my love while we talk and stuff our faces. YUM coming back for more tamales for sure."}
{"text":"From beginning to end this restaurant surpassed my expectations. Started with the queso fundido which was so rich and sweet yet spicy enough to capture the heart of your tastebuds. Then moved on to the shrimp cocktail with the perfect balance of ingredients inside. Moving on to my entree was the mojarra Frita just like my mom used to make and I couldn't have asked for anything different. Just to finish the meal fried ice cream to cleanse the tastebuds so delicious I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"First time here earlier today 

It's so hard to find good restaurants in the east side but I found this place on Yelp and it had high reviews do I decided why not let's give it a try 

 this place is great everyone was so nice and helpful (I don't speak spanish lol) nor does my grandma 

They were very helpful with helping us make selections I usually eat the same thing but I saw somthing that sparked my interested I forgot the name but it had strawberry cream sauce which I thought was interesting? I must say I wasn't disappointed it was super yummy 

I would totally go back I've never heard anyone recommend this place to me before but it totally needs more publicity!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Love the food and the service was great. I had a  taco and chili relleno."}
{"text":"Had to try this restaurant since we LOVE Mexican food and we were very happy. The food is fresh and hot. Salsa is unique, very tasty and the bean dip w chips are awesome. The fideo soup was fun with alphabet pieces (kids will love it)  but has a great flavor. I was pleasantly surprised when our server, Cesar, brought us lightly sautéed onion and jalapeño slices. Very fresh and tasty.  I ordered beef taquitos and my son, Chris, ordered carne asada tacos. Yum to both. Definitely recommend this restaurant. Nice and clean too.

Alan told us about the weekend special that his grandmother makes called Corundas. Gotta try them!!!!"}
{"text":"If your looking for real authentic michoacan dishes this if definitely the place to be, it's family owned and can taste the home style cooking in it... excellent service they absolutely go out of there way to make u feel welcomed so thank you very much \"Viri\". The corundas and uchepos is definitely worth the drive for me since I clearly live across town in the SW area. I definitely appreciate how they went out of their way to make sure I had my cravings taken care of since they noticed I was pregnant lol, which proves that they thrive to make sure u have an excellent experience."}
{"text":"This place was amazing...servers and bus boys were great help and very nice....food was extremely delicious...had a chance try the corundas and absolutely loved them...will definitely go back."}

{"text":"Ate here for New Years Eve dinner last night with the hubs and my 4yo. Got a groupon. It was really good! Very nice & attentive service, good food & drinks."}
{"text":"This place is always packed and every time that I have been here it is very good. 

For something near the base that isn't full of shady characters it is great. Yes, it is on the east side which isn't that desirable. 

The food is always spot on, family friendly(which is hard to find in Vegas) and the staff has always been friendly. 

Yes, it is very hispanic but what do you expect for a true Mexican restaurant? 

I can't say that I have had anything that is subpar here or that just isn't very good."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited for the first time on Sunday evening. As we were walking to our table, my husband passed out. The establishment immediately called 911 and while waiting for their arrival the family and entire staff were extremely attentive. They continued to do so for our entire stay once the paramedics left. Both my husband and I were impressed and very
touched by their care.
By the way, once all was ok we stayed and had a delicious dinner. No doubt, Las Tarascas will be our favorite place...yummy food, good prices and GREAT HUMANS!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had written a review on this Restaurant, but for some reason it got deleted. I just want to say that they have genuine Mexican Food here!! Very fun and exciting environment. We decided to come here for a friends birthday party dinner. We were a party of 15 people, and I must say service was exceptional for a party of 15. I never had to ask for a refill because our server was very attentive. The food was delicious! Great portions for the price!
I recommend this Las Tarascas for all of my Mexican Food Lovers!"}
{"text":"Amazing Customer Service From Viri our server And The Entire Staff food was deliciouse and freshly made to order this will be my family place to be once a month also great music and just an amazing enviroment!!!!! I am born and raised from los angeles california my wifes parents are from michoacan mexico and let me say the corundas bomb.com and preparadas too!!!! Descent prices as well!!!! Def recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great new find. The place doesn't look like your usual Mexican Restaurant but dont let that fool you. The food and service is great. I had the Vaca Moreliana New Yotk steak and it was the best steak I had in a very long time."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday and I really thought this place would be packed, to my surprise it was not, there was one other family there and then a few others got there after us. 

We were sat by the entrance in a 
booth to what they added a  table which I think was a little hard to get in and out for the ones that sat inside the booth. 

They have a great selection on the menu, we all order different plates and they were all pretty tasty. They don't have a drink menu but do have good drinks. I had the \"michoacana\" it's good but I just wish they had different tequila selections. They have different brands but it's all silver tequila. 

There was a duo playing songs for free (tipping is highly recommended on my part) it made the ambiance just perfect. 

If I were a local this would probably be my go to spot. Customer service is average, they are nice and check on you plenty of times. 

We will be coming back next time we visit Las Vegas! 

P.S.  Ladies restroom is creepy, the fan makes a terrible noise. It will be nice if they replaced it."}
{"text":"Omg we were driving by didn't know this was here but we decided to stop since everything was closed at 11pm (including this place) we went in and they had karaoke and we asked if we could still eat and they said yes! Excellent service super impressed and to top it off it was deslish!!!  I'm so coming back this will be the new after game kick it spot! Must have the ceviche!!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Not in the best side of town but totally worth it. Had great queso fundido con chorizo, hubby had the carnitas which have an wonderful citrus flavor and I had the Vaca ranchera which was excellent. Can't wait to come back. :-)"}
{"text":"Everything was great! The server, Daniel, was one of the best servers I've ever had at any restaurant. He was friendly, passionate, and knowledgable. He seems to know everything about each dish. All the employees we met were nice and we will request Daniel in the future.

As for the food, huge portions that are delicious. We got the jalapeños with shrimp and chorizo as well as a four item combo. The four item combo was massive. Had to box up half of it. My dad got the fried fish and they let him try multiple sauces. One of the sauces had strawberry in it and was the only thing I didn't like that I tried. The fish was great though and the garlic sauce was amazing if you're a garlic lover.

We wanted to try desert (they have fried ice cream) but got too full. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I love their attention to their customers. Even before we came inside someone rushed to open the door and right before we left same thing. Food was amazing and very authentic. The drinks were pretty good too. My dad loves Lindo Michoacan made a comment that this is his new favorite place! The waiter, Lalo and hostesses were so friendly! Definitely coming back! Thank you :)"}
{"text":"So disappointed with this place after seeing it was a 4.5 star joint and I seldom make it out to the beautiful section of Northeast Vegas (cough). 

We walked in and 90% of the customers were Mexican...usually a good sign and that's when it all went downhill...

We ordered: Corundas Tarascas (13.99) and Bracerito a La Meseta Tarasca For Two (38.99)
and here's what went wrong:

THE WAIT
Waited almost 90 minutes for our food. Even the waiter said, \"You guys haven't gotten your food yet??!!\" When he saw our drowning looks after an hour and fifteen minutes...and we were close to just leaving.

DISH UNO
The corundas tarascas was supposed to have pieces of pork, I counted 4 small pieces in the sauce. $14 for some corn bread in a red sauce...no bueno.

DISH DOS
The Meseta Tarasca for two...I've had these type of mixed \"paradilla\" (or whatever each restaurant likes to name them) plates before many times and I'm familiar with how they're grilled and how they come out...it's like fajitas for two with a shitload more meat (hence $40 tag). The entire dish was completely burned and overcooked, embarrassing to even bring to a table. The steak was beyond well done..gray and tough, destroyed. The chorizo was black and dried out, inedible. The pounded chicken breast was so overcooked and tough I couldn't cut through it with a regular table knife. The beef ribs were both burnt to black...and the sauce that comes out on top of the dish that many yelpers took photos of (and is on their website) was non-existent. 

ACCOUNTABILITY
The waiter saw we weren't too happy and apologized and said he'd bring the manager over. I guess he knew he served up a plate of embarrassment because I didn't even ask to speak to anyone (wouldn't want them to replace the burnt food anyway because who knows how that really goes) but an older woman comes over and I said, \"We waited an hour and a half for our meal and look, it's completely burnt.\" Her response, \"Yes, ok.\" with a smile...and that was that.

THE SERVICE
Had a guy and a girl serving us...very friendly, but totally incompetent. We were asked if we wanted corn or flour tortillas. We said, flour...we got neither...20 minutes after the food arrived I had to ask for them. Also, the mixed meat dish was supposed to come with a skillet of melted Mexican cheese as is shown on the menu, on their website and is on all the yelp pics. When I asked for the cheese the waitress said it doesn't come with cheese. I then had to point it out to her on the menu that it does in fact come with the \"melted cheese\"...\"oh ok, I'll get that for you.\" This was 30 minutes after the food had already arrived and I was just wanting to bounce...maybe she didn't want the extra work of grabbing what I paid for or it was her first day of work...I'll go with the first."}
{"text":"Excellent! Best Mexican restaurant I've been to in a long time. Had the carne asada burrito and tacos, it all was very good. Food and service is great."}
{"text":"My visit was on April 6, my moms bday! The food and staff A+! Everyone in our party ordered a different dish so we can pick on each other's dish  to try it and everything was good! I had the enchilada combo, yum! I was impressed with the tortillas, loved both corn and flour (they give you both!) & my stepdad is very picky & I mean picky when it comes down to Mexican food and he loved it and wants to come back! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Friendly staff the moment you walk in ! 
Very clean environment, music was not to loud which is perfect when your having a conversation with family members. 
Food was amazing we all loved it! 
I would recommend to anyone and I would most definitely come back !!"}
{"text":"I came here about a week ago and was definitely impressed! The restaurant had a nice ambiance, and was nicely decorated. The service was excellent! Our waiter, Cesar, offered great and friendly service. He always made sure to check in with our table. Chips, beans, and drinks were always refilled before they were even gone, which is something that is usually overlooked by other restaurants I've been to. I ordered Chicken estilo Zamorana, one of their specialty sauces, with their homemade tortillas from the lunch menu. The portions were not only generous, but delicious as well.  I also tried their specialty drink \"La Michocana\", and it was so good! It was the perfect drink for hot days. Definitely make sure to stop by and try this authentic Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in , we felt the great atmosphere. They were very nive to my friends and I. There was a mariachi band that played some great songs for us . i give it two stars because of the food. The beans were horrible . they tasted like can beans . the sopa de fideo had no flavor , couldn't made it better my self. I asked for alot of onions and limons to give all the food flavor. The drinks are delicious bit food is terrible. Fell bad saying because they were really friendly but i have to be honest. Its to expensive for the quality. I think all the comments are misleading ."}
{"text":"I can say this is home made mexican food. Compared to other Mexican restaurants. this is one of my new favorites. The customer service was above expectations.
First time coming here and I will be returning!
We went for my friends birthday party.
We had a party of 15 people and I can't complain about anything. We sat down and right away they got our drinks ordered and appetizers and in less than 5 minutes we were eating! Food was full of flavor. 
Lalo was our server he was very attentive and on top of everything. I didn't even have to ask for a refill, because he was very attentive and he made us all feel welcomed. 
I really recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is no longer in business. Sad to say as they were nice people, but the food went downhill the last couple months and we could tell things were bad."}
{"text":"This place is a find! The first impression is that it's very clean and welcoming. The guacamole is made table side to your taste and so fresh and delicious, tortillas are hand made, margaritas are perfect and not too sweet. Our dishes were very authentic and cooked perfectly. Everything was so delicious! We plan on going back again and again to work our way through this very unusual menu. Cascor and Manny gave delightful and professional service. This truly is the best Mexican restaurant we've eaten at anywhere in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I am loving it!!! Great customer service, super friendly staff and well treating.  Love when u first sit they bring a small samples of chips and 2 salsas with yummy soup.  Incredible delicious food and well served.   I definitely recommend this place for everyone!!!"}

\"The Best Mexican Food I've Had In Las Vegas.\"

Food/Drink: For starters,  I ordered the combo of the Beef Tamal and the Chicken Enchiladas which came out pretty yummy. First it was served with the bean dip and chips. The chips were fresh and the bean dip was hot and tasty. Also their salsa is to die for! (it really doesn't need too many seasonings in it because the flavors of the chili are fresh, well ground up, and blended). It was also served with a soup that came with it on the side as a nice little surprise and that also was very tasty.

Service: when I first walked into this place I was greeted with a smile. The servers here look very polished and the ambiance here is warm. From the waiters bringing timely service and having the food brought out in a short amount of time to the manager coming out to offer discounts for his new business all seem too good to be true from a place that look like it was a hole in the wall. 

Atmosphere: the inside of this place looks absolutely fantastic the TVs are set up to listen to music and watch Spanish videos and the decor will make you feel like you are in a five-star classy yet traditional restaurant in Mexico. Only reason why I gave it before is because from the outside it looks like a hole in the wall and that takes away from how wonderful this place truly is!

Price: I paid a little less than $11 for a 2 item combo which came with a very generous portion of hot beans, salsa, and even soup. The prices here are reasonable for what you get!

Parking: there is parking available in the front of the restaurant.

MY THOUGHTS? I am absolutely amazed by this place and can't wait to tell my family and friends about it. I have now found somewhere on the east side that I can enjoy coming to instead of being worried about weird smells, insects, and the food tasting like its been sitting for hours. Also, the service with a smile is definitely a nice touch. 

RECOMMENDATIONS: just try it! is my suggestion! Take it from a hard core foodie like me who takes my food personally....the food and service is 5 star!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing- and not solely due to not being as busy.  They were accommodating and attentitive in addition to having amazing soup and salsa to start out the meal.  I would recommend the hotter salsa due to better flavor than the regular just ask the server for the hotter stuff.  We did the 3 item combo definitely recommend the cheese enchilada and chili verde burrito.  They smother the cheese enchilada with cheese."}
{"text":"Came on their grand opening! I got to try \"Viri's Specialty Drink\" while enjoying the music by live mariachi.
las Tarascas had very friendly staff & tasty Authentic Mexican food! I couldn't stop eating"}
{"text":"Love the food n service!!! They not only brought chips n salsa, which I didn't really care for, but also brought bean dip n grilled onions n jalapeños!!! When I asked what they used in their mole he brought me a sample to try!! Super friendly n hospitable!! And the food was very good as well!!! Definitely recommend!!!"}
