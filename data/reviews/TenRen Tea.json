{"text":"Nice milk tea, bubble tea, & hot tea.  I would not eat there. Their food is too greasy & salty.  I usually just pop in to get a drink.  Good for meeting up with friends if they are into bubble tea."}
{"text":"It was bad -_- The drinks, the food and the service. I've always liked Tenren and I wanted to try out this \"new\" location out. We ordered:  MILK TEA The milk tea was so bitter and tasted so bad. Its so watered down.  SESAME MILK TEA The whole drink tasted like undissolved powder - It was so bad. You can see the two sections in different colours (one for the undissolved powder and another is the watery substance).   PU-ERH BEEF NOODLES  It wasn't even the green noodles that we get at the other Tenren locations (shouldn't all franchise locations have the same menu?). It was just plain noodles which weren't very good either. Soup base was sooo oily. We proceeded to ask the waitress about the noodles but her response was that only the Highway 7 location had the spinach noodles (Which is not true because other locations provided this dish with spinach noodles).  Will not return."}
{"text":"I love the meal and it tastes quite delicious. I do not know why some other reviewer gave so low rates. Maybe the store is improving its service as well. It is close to the movie theater. I love to try the meal before movies."}
{"text":"This restaurant is ok. I've been there plenty of times for drinks (mostly because my friends like it there and it's pretty close to the Cineplex) and all the time I was almost satisfied. I've tried their food few times. In many instances the taste was OK (nothing memorably good) but the portions are pretty small. Quality varies.  Last time I went for food, they gave me a dish that was rice soup + chicken + vegetables. First two parts were OK as usual, but the vegetable part was awfully horrible. Seems like they put all the vegetable bottoms in there (the part that they probably should have thrown out) and it tasted really odd. Even the waitress felt that oddity when she was serving the food and started explaining that the cooks told her that it's a kind of alleged bok choy, but she couldn't finish her sentence (showing that she didn't know what she was talking about - probably because she wasn't explained by the cooks properly that wth was that). She was like: \"the cook said it's kind of bok choy, but umm... I don't know... um...\"  I usually don't send back servings to the kitchen (maybe because I'm a bit shy when it comes to that), so I just accepted it and tried to finish my rice soup and chicken. Thinking back, maybe I should have really sent it back this time.  Realizing that cooks there treat their customers like an idiot and try to justify their poorly made food with not even a proper explanation to what it was makes me not to go there anymore. It felt like they thought \"OK this guy probably wouldn't care/question what he's eating, so let's just put whatever in his dish and it'll be alright...\")  Not to mention every time I go there, my shirt gets smelly (that doesn't happen with other restaurants) which shows the bad restaurant set up and probably non-standard ingredients in their food... My friends admit that too.  I gave them two and not one star because their drink is good, but the mentality that I think was behind the last food really disappointed me."}
