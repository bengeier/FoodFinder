{"text":"Honestly, if I could give this place no stars, I probably would. I live in the Pittsburgh area, but am not originally from here and I had heard great things about this place. My family and I were excited to try it, especially because the location is in a really cool part of Pittsburgh. I'm all for trying the dives and small town \"institutions\", but this is one that I can't get behind. I so wanted to like this place and our experience was just awful from start to finish. Our service was appalling- there really wasn't an service at all actually. If we needed anything or wanted to add something on, we were SOL. Took our order, dropped our check with food and never saw him again. Unfortuantely, the food wasn't much better. Between the 6 of us, we got a pretty large variety and none of us really enjoyed our food. My 4 year old son wouldn't eat his pancakes at all; they're really quite different which I don't always see as a bad thing, but they just were not good. I felt like our bill was extremely overpriced for what we got and our overall experience. It kinda shocked me that people think so highly of this place, especially after looking at our bill. It would be one thing to put up with all of this if it were because it was a bargain. But, alas, it was not. I'd be hard-pressed to ever want to return."}
{"text":"Pamela's is good if you feel like being a Glutton.

The pancakes are enormous (fill a plate) but are thin with crispy edges.  The bacon is good but seems kind of like that really thin chewy kind that is sold as pre-cooked bacon.  Nothing seemed overly greasy.  My pal got the pancakes stuffed with walnuts and bananas - these looked yummy but very indulgent.

The restaurant is a bit squishy - lots of tables and chairs to weave between until are shown to your seat.  The service is good and the food comes out quickly.  We went around 9am on a Saturday and there wasn't a wait.  As we left, a line was forming.

This isn't my favorite breakfast place in the area...but it is a solid option depending on which  neighborhood you're in."}
{"text":"Food and price great but this Pamela's definitely missed the usual hallmark this local chain establishment is known for of great CLEAN, and nostalgically-hip decorated.
Bonus points for super survive.
But really Pamela's close for a few days to clean,paint and give us the touches of you we love so much!
Until then I'll drive to see you in one of your other locales!"}
{"text":"They sell Costco brand pre-cooked microwave bacon as their \"cooked\" bacon. Paper thin. Do not waste your money. Location has gone done hill lately."}
{"text":"Unhealthy food. Cash only too:(
I also don't respect people who are too political
With their opinions."}
{"text":"Good food. Pancakes are unique. Somewhere between a pancake and crispy buttery crepe. Only complaint is being stuck by the door with the hoards of people waiting to sit down."}
{"text":"I will never understand how this place gets good reviews.
the coffee is horrendous.
all of the flavored are muted, nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast places in Pittsburgh -  besides any other Pamela's locations and Deluca's in the strip.  Anyone that is still going to the smiley place for rubberfied eggs served alongside dried out potatoes is missing the boat.  The lyonnaise potatoes are perfection, the spinach and feta omelet is something I always order and the pancakes are to die for."}
{"text":"The Mt Lebanon site is the best of the 2 other sites that I have frequented (5 total). Hotcakes with strawberries is the consistently the most delicious breakfast in Pittsburgh. Longer wait times during peak hours (the Diner is adjacent to 2 churches).  Somewhat surprisingly, other entrees are also quite delicious especially the corned beef hash. Modest surroundings - one huge room with tables crowded together."}
{"text":"I visited Pamela's recently and ordered \"the morning after\" with a side of potatoes! The pancakes were amazing as was my ham, eggs, and potatoes! The disappointing part was the bacon my bf ordered! The bacon was not done at all and was not edible! Besides that, it was great food, and we didn't wait long in line either!

Also, cash only! For anyone planning to visit"}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast - they have excellent pancakes and potatoes.  I ate a burger here for lunch once and was not impressed.  Perhaps I should just stick with what they do best."}
{"text":"I always enjoy going to this place after a good night of fun! The servers are usually really friendly and I don't mind giving them a good tip. The only thing is that the wait is always crazy but other than that, I really enjoy coming here!"}
{"text":"I'd always heard how amazing this place was and of did not love up to the hype in my opinion. I didn't like the lioneese (spelling?) Potatoes but the hot cakes were good. Don't know if I'll go back"}
{"text":"Horrible service -
Just returned from breakfast.   While food was good, experience was ruined by inattentive service.  No one came to check on us to see if all was ok or if we needed refills on our drinks.   When we left, were not told Have a Nice Day or Thanks for Coming In.   Will think twice about returning to a place where my dollars aren't appreciated."}
{"text":"I adore this breakfast emporium.  Shonda is the James Brown of servers-------{\"The hardest  working woman in show business\"-----er, at least the diner business--------and with the prettiest smile}.

And the potatoes are to die for.

The Tex/Mex omelet is beyond heavenly.."}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome, fast, friendly service and delicious food. It's already a tradition! Try the stuffed crepes. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Terrible treatment. Extremely hard to find parking. Cash only. And they won't seat you unless your entire party is standing there squished in like sardines. I was there this morning with my baby in a carrier and my mother. We were waiting for my husband to find parking and while there were at least half a dozen open tables, they would not seat us. So I had to stand there holding the baby carrier by the cold front door.  Totally idiotic. Won't be back. I'll stick with Shady Side."}
{"text":"This is a favorite for a lot of people I know, but I can't get past the noise, the subpar food, and the lack of parking.  The food is just ehhh.  There is nothing on the menu that makes me excited to go there.  I would rather go to Bob's Diner for an egg dish or The Original Pancake House for pancakes.  As far as lunch goes, I tried it with my mom and she wasn't impressed either."}
{"text":"Family dined here for lunch.  Daughter ordered a cheeseburger here. It wasn't even cooked all the way! Raw, took pics! Talked to the server about this, he said that there wasn't anything he could do, he said I've only been here 3yrs????What??? So, we went to pay told  the cashier about the problem, she said se would talk to the cook! She removed it from our bill, which was \"THE  RIGHT THING TO DO!\"  I was more worried about the part of the burger that she ate!  I notified the owners to let them know about this, so it wouldn't happen to anybody else. and they never got back to me!!! \"THEY REALLY CARE!!\""}
{"text":"How can this place only have one review??? I know that I've checked in here multiple time before??? One the weekends I would be surprised if you won't wait. I can't find anything to complain about. The service is always right on and the food is delicious, from their crepe style pancakes to my personal favorites \"Gail's Favorite eggs\"and the \"Tex-Mex\" Omelet. Just so you know this joint is CASH only, with no ATM on premise, so plan accordingly. Don't worry though you shouldn't need a a lot because the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is bad. It doesn't seem like they are happy to have you. While I love the strawberry crepes, fighting the crowd, standing in line pushed up towards the door,  being told \"cash only'  and being served bad coffee makes me wonder why I went there in the first place."}
{"text":"Wife had banana chocolate chip pancakes, I went for the morning after special and both were phenomenal. I'm a breakfast sausage guy and it was nothing special but certainly edible. We loved this place."}
{"text":"Order the strawberry pancakes and you will not be disappointed. (The waffle was pretty good.)"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant,so happy it's easy to get to.  The parking lot is awful, way too small, but sometimes you can get a spot out front. Food is fantastic those pancakes are wonderful, as are the potatoes.  The employees are all friendly and professional. My sister loves this place, and she is hard to impress!"}
{"text":"Great diner food and service!! Breakfast was good and The lyonnaise potatoes are and a yummy option to take home, as they reheat very well in the oven."}
{"text":"Almost 3 Stars, but not there yet. Food was fine, but not so good that you want to eat there again and again. Service seems to be a team effort, which was good because some of the team members were good, others, well, not so much. It's a breakfast diner, so don't expect too much and you will feel fine when you pay."}
{"text":"This is a famous place in Pittsburgh for its Crepe Pancakes. That's what I would order.
The other breakfast choices are not prepared with finesse at all rather just cooked and thrown on the plate. But the Crepe Pancakes are unique and great."}
{"text":"Excellent. Every time. Got the Tex med omelette. Fast service and really tasty.  A little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"It's a diner and the food is good diner food. The staff me and my son had were friendly, helpful and observant. Now, that that's out of the way.....let's move on to what really drove me to write this review.....SPACE CAT.

you might be, what? Have you been smoking the crack? I assure you, no, I have not been smoking the crack. 

There is a whole wall mural and within that mural is the city of Pittsburgh and a cat in an astronaut suit and that cat is space cat. The wall says something like, whenever he visits, apparently space cat is a he, anyway, whenever he visits earth, space cat stops by and eats at p&g's or something close to that. I don't know, I only read it once because my son sat right below space cat and since I sat across from him, I couldn't help but to look up at space cat and there's something about this cat that pulls you in, maybe it's the eyes? 

I would've taken a picture but honest to whatever you may believe in, I don't have a smartypants phone so you'll have to take my word for it.

I highly recommend going if not for the diner and food and stuff but for the chance to gaze upon space cat."}
{"text":"I came in 15 minutes before closing (Something I usually try to avoid doing, having been in the business for ten years myself). I was the only customer left in the place and they were clearly getting ready to close for the day.  Still they sat me with a smile.  The interior had that old Towne diner feel but was clean and bright.  The food was ready in five minutes. The coffee and the food were hot,  fresh,  and delicious. I had the morning after breakfast special,  simple but elegant and the most unique and delicious plain pancakes I've ever had! The scrambled eggs were real and flavorful,  and the sausage had that perfect pop when you bite into it with a juicy savory interior. If they can make a simple breakfast staple taste this good, I can't wait to see what else they've got.  I'm definitely coming back.  Franchise anyone?"}
{"text":"This will probably turn out to be one of my shortest reviews; here goes:

I love this Pamela's. It's super close to my part of town. They know exactly how to cook whatever you order, from pancakes to omelets. Everything is delicious. Even the actual place, despite being small, feels super welcoming and open; I love their decor and exploring what's up on and around the walls. I've actually ordered lunch sandwiches here and at the Oakland location and loved them, but not nearly as much as breakfast. Breakfast is Pamela's specialty no matter what part of town you're in.

Others have mentioned the long wait during peak hours, but that's true of ALL Pamela's locations. Similarly, all of the locations are cash only, so I can't hold this against them.

I'll be back soon, Pamela's!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  The service was excellent.  The manager Ben took care of a slight problem we had very quick and even gave us free coffee.  We had heard it was the best breakfast in Pittsburgh and it is!  Great start to hopefully a good day and a Steeler win against the Bengals!  Go Steelers!!"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try Pamela's for awhile and I wish it had lived up to the hype.  Sadly we were both disappointed in the meal and experience.  The portions were very small and didn't not equate at all to the inflated prices.  The Tex-Mex omlet was OK but VERY small.  The bacon was downright awful.  The meat and eggs was also very small and there was no way that it equated to 2 eggs.  Service was ok but certainly didn't go out of their way be very friendly.  With so many great places for breakfast in the area I would suggest someplace OTHER than Pamela's."}
{"text":"Food and service were amazing by far the best French toast in town. Will return for more croissant French toast"}
{"text":"If you haven't had Pamela's Pancakes (Hotcakes..?), well, I don't think you've lived a single day in Breakfast paradise, like me. Pamela's is great from their food, their speedy service, and their pricing. Their location is right off 19, so parking might be a little bit of a problem, but I live right down the street, so I just walk. Problem solved.

Back to the Pancake. Pamela's has clearly set the precedent for all the pancakes in the world. These things are the bees knees. I don't think I've ever had a pancake so good in my life. They seriously make every single pancake I've ever had before taste like mush. These cakes have so much flavor, and they're paper thin too. How do they do thattt???

I cherish having Pamela's right up the street from me, and I will continue on coming in and ordering their bangin' pancakes as frequently as I can."}
{"text":"I walked in the door only to be told I couldn't be seated until my other person was here (table for two). I wanted to be seated and have a coffee while I waited I was told I had to wait. I could see if I have a large party but it's just two and their are plenty of tables....there were now i stand next to the cold door and watch all the tables fill so now I'm on the waiting list to get a table when I came here early to make sure I had a table. I will never be back just based on the poor service I received from \"Eddie\"."}
{"text":"Pamela's Diner is a great place to go if you are looking for an awesome breakfast. We went there on Sunday around 10 and the place was very busy but we immediately got a table and it didn't take too long to get our food. The one negative is that it is very loud, my boyfriend could barely hear me talk. They do have outdoor seating so that would have been a better option for us. Also the place only accepts cash which we did not know before we arrived and had to leave before sitting to get money from the bank. But overall the food is yummy. We both got the famous crepe pancakes and bacon as our meat. I couldn't even finish mine I was so full! Our waitress was also very sweet but our host was a bit gruff. In the end, a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"The food overall is nothing special, we were disappointed in the quality of bacon. The reason I am giving four stars is because the pancakes were to die for. They are not the cakey sicky sweet they are crispy and delicious. I would only recommend glut back for the pancakes. I thought it was a little overpriced for mediocre quality food at breakfast time."}
{"text":"This location is going down hill. Used to be our favorite. The past few times, the quality of the food has really decreased. My ham and cheese omelet has less and less ham each visit, and the eggs are often over-cooked. The bacon is microwaved - unacceptable. The pancakes are still good, but we've been disappointed in everything else lately. Feels more like a \"fast food\" type of place. We recently went to the one in the strip and it's sooooo much better!"}
{"text":"The service and food at Pamela's in Mt. Lebanon is exceptional.  Seldom do I find a place that is so warm, friendly and efficient.  They go out of their way to make you feel welcome, make sure you are satisfied with your food, and keep your cup full.  Edie and the crew get a 10 in my book!"}
{"text":"Pamela's did not live up to the hype. I ordered a veggie omelet the veggie inside were okay. When I get charge for a three egg I expect 3 eggs not one and half liquid eggs burned no less. My sons hybrid pancake crape was burned and crunchy. It's not working go one way or the other better yet offer both. The only saving grace was my wife's chorizo hash. But not enough for a return trip. I worked the breakfast for years and cracked countless eggs for omelets."}
{"text":"My meal - crepe-style pancakes & turkey sausage patties - was Excellent. Pancakes were light & delicious, sausage flavorful. Service was Outstanding! Staff was happy & friendly & made sure I had everything I needed & was enjoying the meal - they were all \"my\" waitress."}
{"text":"Great food. Great location. Prices are absolutely fair. I wish they served alcoholic beverages with breakfast but oh well. 

Food comes out hot and fast. Service here is very speedy because they're usually packed. You might have a short wait to get in and sit but absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"The hotcakes here are crepe style, and are served rolled up with any fruit and toppings in the middle with a dollop of sour cream on top.  My wife had the strawberry pancakes and loved them - the hotcakes had a great buttery crunch to the edges.  I had the texas french toast, which was batter-dipped buttery goodness incarnate.

All the portions were ample for the price, no one went away hungry.

The only downside was parking.  The lot is minscule, and on-street parking was a minor pain, but not unexpected for a Saturday brunch (11am).  The other downside was that during said saturday brunch rush, the close-packed tables can be loud when the place is full of people."}
{"text":"This place is good. The Tex-Mex omelet is the closest thing to Tex-Mex I've had since moving to PA from Texas and that includes the Mexican restaurants!

The banana chocolate chip hotcakes are more like a crepe than actual hotcakes. The Dor-Stop has them beat on banana chocolate chip hotcakes. 

The famous lyonnaise potatoes were delicious. Very rich and tasty. The potatoes were better than my hotcakes and the Tex-Mex omelet was the winner by far. 

The staff were friendly. It's a little hectic inside when it's busy. Trying to get in and get your name on the list while other people pile in causes some tension on making sure no one line jumps you. 

The cash only thing is a little absurd and behind the times. I'd be interested in knowing the thought behind that. But if you're prepared its NBD."}
{"text":"I don't get the local fascination with this place.  The food is always swimming in grease and is so oversized its unnecessary.  

This was the second time I tried this place.   The taste is ok if you can get past the grease for any eggs and the pancakes are varied and tasty.   But nothing can kill a place like unsanitary conditions and bad, rude, inattentive service.  I would like to see my server more than once  and not feel like I'm bothering her!   The multiple, persistent flies on every sticky surface, at this sitting, was so off putting I finally just left my meal.  Waitress watched us battling flies (I'm not talking one or two, but a dozen or so over tables, food, windows, everything) and didn't apologize or seem fazed or ask if anything was wrong with my mostly full meal pretty much left untouched.   I regret that we paid, but we did, and we left.  Definitley wont be returning."}
{"text":"I heard about \"The Best Pancakes in Pittsburgh\" on the Bubba Show so I had to try them. I love pancakes! They were delicious! Definitely not what I expected them to look like but nonetheless amazing! The food and service were good but that restaurant REALLY needs a good cleaning!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience! 
Great for brunch. Should start accepting cards too 
Potatoes are delicious!!"}
{"text":"We decided to try somewhere we'd never been before and found ourselves at Pamela's this morning. There was a little wait, but that just means people enjoy the food!  

After 15 minutes or so, we were sat and our waitress came over to grab our drink order & returned promptly with them. We requested to have a few minutes with the menu. The kid got 2 chocolate chip pancakes, ham & rye toast. Hubby got French toast, bacon & rye toast.  As much as I wanted crepe style pancakes, I am on a no wheat diet, so I chose Gail's Eggs. 

We all liked our meals, which came out incredibly fast, especially for how busy the place was. The fellas enjoyed their meals more than I did mine, but only because I'm not a big onion eater and there were a lot of onions in the potatoes that came with my eggs.

Coffee was good, decor was 50's space agey (which is quite unique) and the service was good, as was the food. Will definitely give it another try and pick something else on the menu to savor. 

*Take CASH with you as they are a cash only diner*"}
{"text":"We've been here twice and they have good breakfast food. Both times service was just ok but the food was pretty good. Not the first place I'd choose for a breakfast spot, but good enough for the convenience of how close it is."}
{"text":"Honestly some of the best pancakes I've ever had. Super good, although they don't take cards. Only cash"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!!  Love the retro diner look but better yet it feels like a cozy retro diner. Great food, friendly and fast service, a whole pitcher of coffee left on our table which, as a coffee fanatic, I enjoyed very much. Went on a Tuesday around 8:30/9am so no wait and half the tables full. Can't speak to how it is on a busy weekend but overall enjoyed the experience!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. Go here! Tex mex omelette was the best thing ever. Salsa, guac, chorizo, sour cream.. Seriously I died and went to heaven. Their bread is like thick Texas toast or something, to die for. And their potatoes--seriously amazing. And the price is so legit. Not expensive at all. My boyfriend got something with pancakes and they were like crepe style pancakes and he was drooling over them. So awesome. 
And the service was great. Our server was friendly and I honestly think the food came out faster than it would at an actual fast food place. To some that may seem weird but when I'm hungry I hate waiting so it was awesome for us!
It is kinda of a small place. And it is cash only. So keep that in mind. But please get breakfast here ASAP. 
Oh, they do have some lunch items as well but their menu is on the small side in general."}
{"text":"Really can't review a diner when you wait so long to place an order that you realize if you want to eat you need to go somewhere else. I always have enjoyed the P&G diner at other locations, the Mt Lebanon one is a new low for me. My recomendation is to head somewhere, heck anywhere other than here. I'm at 15 minutes and still waiting."}
{"text":"I used to go here after work almost every Sunday morning on the recommendation of one of my coworkers.  Man I love that girl for introducing me to this place!!!  I don't even like pancakes and I had theirs almost every week.  SO GOOD!!  The lightness, the crunchy, the yummy.  Also, best limeade I've ever had.  And I hate when reviews say that.  But OMG yes!  Lyonnaise potatoes?  YES PLEASE!!  I want to go back to Pittsburgh just to eat here daily during my visit. Yummmm."}
{"text":"Never disappoints! If you're looking for traditional diner food, this is it. The pancakes are definitely a staple item here, but make sure to try their omelets with lyonnaise potatoes as a side!  The service was also spot on."}
{"text":"Love this Pamela's diner! I have eaten at the Strip's location and this one. Smaller than the original. BUT amazing food and a speedy, pleasant and efficient service. The pancakes are what I come for but I stay for the Lyonnaise potatoes!! Turkey sausage, toast and eggs were also perfectly cooked. My only caution is parking. It is a small and tight parking lot."}
{"text":"The food was great and I got a generous portion. The waitress, Shonda, was fabulous."}
{"text":"I just....come on, Pamela's. I usually enjoy my experiences at this chain but they have some work to do to make me want to keep coming.  This review is representative more of this particular experience than the company as a whole. 

Everyone who's been to Pamela's knows that it's cash only at this point,  but I do find that a little ridiculous in 2017. They aren't a single restaurant anymore, or a small diner in a small town - they are a thriving local chain in a major city, boasting-I believe-7 locations.  If I can accept a payment from a credit card using my phone,  Pamela's can install a credit card reader. 

Went in for lunch on a Wednesday.  There were 4-5 tables seated including ours and two servers to cover them, so not busy at all. However, ours ignored us after getting drinks and didn't take our orders for another 20 minutes. A couple that came in after us was eating before we even got to order. He said he thought we just wanted coffee, though we gave no indication for this and were very clearly looking at the menus? And even after he apologized for that and said he'd be right back, he disappeared for 5 more minutes-cleaning behind the counter, refilling other customers' waters, etc. I eventually gave up on trying to catch his eye and had to call out and flag him down. I hate doing that.  

The food was ok.  I've never ordered anything but breakfast there before and I won't again. I got the Greek chicken wrap. The spinach was overcooked and bitter and the wrap could have used more cheese.  The worst part was the chicken though.  They use the reconstituted chicken breasts and you can always tell.  Rubbery to chew and not a very pleasant taste.  The lyonnaise potatoes,  however,  were delicious as always. 

The worst part of the experience was HOW.  INCREDIBLY.  COLD.  it was inside the restaurant. All but two people were eating in their coats. My hands were cold. My toes were cold. The food very quickly got cold,  which definitely did not help me want to eat it. I kept drinking cup after cup of coffee to stay warm. A pair of diners got up and left before placing their orders and told the wait staff that it was because it was just too cold. They feigned surprise, which was just silly. The kitchen staff were all wearing hoodies. One even had his hood up. The staff in a restaurant kitchen were *that* cold. If you've ever worked at a restaurant before, you know this is kinda unheard of. My friend and I went down the street after our meal to a coffee shop to warm up just from being inside Pamela's.

If something is wrong with your heating system or it's too expensive to heat your business to a comfortable temperature, you shouldn't be open in the winter-at least not if your business is a restaurant. Don't make customers suffer. You'd think that all the money they must be saving in credit card fees would enable them to actually heat the place... 

I don't think I'll be back to this location, at least not until summer."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Pamela's since college and have never been to this location. It's just what I remembered. Still cash only though! Insert eye rolls. Food was good, service not the best but I understand they get busy for breakfast but having silverware to eat is important. I loved my corn beef hash and you can't go wrong with the stuffed pancakes!"}
{"text":"We went for brunch after Sunday mass and were not disappointed.  Thanks to inclimate weather, we were able to get a seat quickly and were indulging in the most delicious banana-stuffed pancakes shortly thereafter.  This is probably not the place to try to stick to a diet, as the menu is laden with tempting brunch options.  I would also skip the group, as the restaurant and parking lot are small.  Most importantly, don't forget CASH.  No credit cards are accepted."}
{"text":"Best pancakes in Pittsburgh! Fast and friendly service, a must-have if you are in the city!"}
{"text":"I had spinach and feta omelette with rye toast coffee 
It was hot fast and price right service was excellent 
Only negative was the food was salty"}
{"text":"Wow! These pancakes are to die for! I was visiting Pittsburg for a quick weekend trip and was advised by several locals to go to Pamela's. My first concern was how long will the wait be on a Saturday morning. The wait was surprisingly short. We were quoted 30 minutes, and to my delight, our table was ready in 15 minutes. We ordered the famous pancakes, banana pancakes, and another dish off of the favorites menu so that we could try the lyonnaise potatoes. The pancakes were remarkable. They were super thin, cooked perfectly, and the edges were crispy. The banana pancakes were stuffed with fresh sliced bananas, walnuts, and whipped cream. So damn good! I also enjoyed the potatoes but the pancakes really were the star of show.  Pamela's only takes cash. Stop by an atm and get cash so you can get these pancakes."}
{"text":"I am giving a 2 star because.... This \"diner\" is just not what it used to be. Compared to other breakfast/diners in the area, this is not as unique and special as it once was. The food is good, but not worth the weekend morning wait. It is only a cash joint (\"never trust a pig farmer\"). I also have to add that the folks I dined with, including myself, were \"sick\"toward the end of the day. I am not always so negative on a place, but for all the hype that is always given on this place, I am disappointed."}
{"text":"Overrated and the staff is unfriendly. The cash only rule is ridicules especially since there is not an ATM in the joint. So they don't want to pay a swipe fee and they also don't want to pay any ATM charges pushing the complete burden of paying on the customer....luckily there a ton of other places that will accept my card that can fry eggs and batter."}
{"text":"Immediately upon walking in you get that old diner feel. Lots of chit chatting and people waiting for tables as the busy waitresses hurry to wipe down tables. We didn't wait long, maybe 5 minutes at the most on a Friday morning around 10am. 

We ordered three meals for the two of us, two savory and one sweet. It was all fantastic. The toast was a little too soaked in butter, but what did we expect from an old school diner? Still delicious. 

As tourists, we didn't know we had to pay in only cash. But the ATM was right around the corner and a very convenient 45 second walk. 

It could have been a little cleaner, but they were very busy. Good service for how busy they were. 
We would eat here again solely for the croissant French toast. Yum!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here and at the place on the strip multiple times.  I will sum it up like this.  breakfast doesn't have to be greasy, sugary and disgustingly bad for you.  It doesn't.  You can get great potatoes without having to have your heart stop.  Even the eggs come out swimming in fat.  The bottom of my plate is just one big oil slick every time I go there.  The pancakes are thin because they're weighed down by 1000g of fat and again swimming in fat on your plate.   They're heavy, rich and just not necessary unless you're ordering them for desert and then I would serve 1/2 an order.  Nothing they make that I have tried is prepared with any care or finesse.  It's all over the top and it's not funny anymore.   Buy quality ingredients, prepare them properly without too much fat or sugar, season them properly and let them sing.  

Breakfast is one of my favorite meals.  I should really start a Yelp list of some of my favorite places come to think of it.  I'm always sorry I ate here every time I get sucked in.  By the way, do something to filter your water because it tastes awful and is probably why the coffee is so bad.  Probably one of the better breakfasts in the Pittsburgh area if you're comparing regions which tells you about the quality of the food here.  I think Deluca's does a better job if you insist on eating out for breakfast in the 'burgh."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday, late morning, for brunch and had to wait 15 minutes for a table but it was totally worth it. I ordered 'the hangover' not because I was hungover but because I felt gluttonous. Everything was awesome. Cash only."}
{"text":"This is a bigger and less crowded location for Pamela's. It's also a bit out of the way in Mt Lebanon, but it has arguably more parking than the other locations (small lot, as well as plenty of street parking close by).

The quality of the food here is consistent with the other Pamela's. As usual, get the hotcakes, and their famous Lyonnaise potatoes. I have *never* found potatoes anywhere else that tasted half as good as these. Of course, don't forget the corned beef hash!

Don't forget that they are cash only. That bites me every single time."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for breakfast, Pamela's is one of the Pittsburgh staples you have to try! I will first start by saying it is CASH ONLY! I didn't realize that until I was inside, but luckily my friends had enough to spot me haha It can be pretty busy during breakfast, but they get people in and out fast! 
My boyfriend ordered the morning after breakfast which came with pancakes, sausage, and eggs.  The pancakes came out looking like beautiful sunbursts! Super cute and super yummy! He also substituted the eggs for Gail's favorite eggs, which are scrambled eggs, cream cheese and scallions, this may sound like an odd combination, but it was creamy, savory and delicious!  I ordered the 2 eggs, sausage and potatoes and it was perfecto! The service was also really great! I know I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"If you are a breakfast person you MUST go here!  My two favorite items on the menu are Gail's Eggs and the Hot Cakes. Gail's eggs are scrambled eggs that come with cram cheese and chives. I thought it sounded weird but it is delicious!!  It comes with home fries and toast. It's a very savory breakfast. If I'm in the mood for sweet then it's all about the hot cakes. They are thin-not as thin as crepes but very close. They have vanilla in the batter which makes them wonderful. They are crispy around the edges so you get soft hot cakes with a bit of crunch. You can get them with chocolate chips and bananas or other combinations or even filled with strawberries and whipped cream but I love them plain. 
It's a CASH only place so hit the ATM first."}
{"text":"Service is good. Pancakes are about the only thing going for this place. The eggs seem mass produced and any kind of cheese tastes like an unopened kraft single- nothing you can't find down at your local UPMC cafeteria."}
{"text":"Best place I've had breakfast since grandma's house.. I haven't had food this good anywhere in ct that's even close. People were extremely friendly and service was great! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Really great breakfast place  fast and friendly service.  The lyonnaise potatoes are too Goodrich pass up,  love the unique pancakes"}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh and was looking for a brunch place.. since I love brunch.  I came to Pamela's a while back because of some word of mouth from some locals.  I was told that Obama was here, his only regret was never going to Pamela's.  Hearing that, I had to come.

I ordered the strawberry hotcakes and their famous lyonnaise potatoes.  I was surprised by the hotcakes.  These were crepe-style and included sour cream.  I've never had sour cream sound so good for breakfast.  I always associated sour cream with mexican food.  No longer!

These hotcakes were beyond delicious.

Then came the lyonnaise potatoes.  These were to die for as well.  They were crispy and soft the way potatoes in the morning should be.  I was in guilty forbidden foods heaven.  The only regret was that I couldn't share this food with my loved ones, as they were back home in California.  I took plenty of pictures just so I could share.  

The ambiance was great too.  It had a very retro feel with 50s decorations.  I wish I could pick up this Pamela's and move it to the Bay Area, just so I could enjoy it more!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in The Burgh!  Crepe style hot cakes were perfect by the corned beef hash KILLED!"}
{"text":"Note #1: This is likely common knowledge now, but it bears repeating in the service of awkwardness avoidance that Pamela's is strictly CASH ONLY.

Note #2: On Sundays, Pamela's only serves breakfast.

Note #3: Pamela's menu apparently differs depending on location as this Mt. Lebanon restaurant has items the others do not. 

Dateline: Sunday May 15th-It's time for Kay to take me home to Brookline from Beaver Falls. Kay is craving pancakes like a zombie longs for live human flesh. She wants to go to Dor-Stop again, but they're only open until 2PM. It's just after noon, and we're 45 minutes away. 

Enter Pamela's: As it turns out, there's an outpost of the Pamela's franchise a brick's toss away from my neighborhood over in posh Mt. Lebanon. I have been meaning to visit one ever since The Prez made the chain famous during a recent trip to our steel metropolis. Renowned for their pancakes, they're open until 3PM everyday including Sundays! Eureka! 

We were greeted by a lovely white-haired woman that I'm sure is ranked in the top 1% of sweetest grandmothers in the world. From there, despite how bustling the place was at the moment, we were seated almost immediately. 

Demeter, how I have pined for scratch corned beef hash. The stuff from a can will and has to do for my bachelor self from time to time, tasting just fine, especially in the form of a sandwich (I'm an Aquarian, we're strange like that). When I saw the words \"famous\" and \"homemade\" in the menu's description, I instantly knew what I wanted. The fact that lunch was unavailable on that day made my decision easier by narrowing my choices. There would be no burger on this early afternoon, no, no... Let There Be Corned Beef Hash and Eggs...over easy!

The phrase \"cooked to perfection\" seems to be the bane of at least one online food critic who finds it overused, particularly on Yelp, a site he seems to wish would go offline.  How else to say it? \"Prepared precisely?\" \"Crowningly coddled?\" \"Faultlessly fried?\"  \"Simmered sublimely?\"

The corned beef hash itself was ample in texture like a loose meatloaf, its flavors richly saliferous, dancing playfully on the edge of being overly so. The generous, lightly yellowed chunks of potatoes underneath were at that ideal point between solid and soft, the way properly cooked breakfast and salad potatoes need very much to be. My over easy eggs were equally indefectible, their yolks runny, warm, inviting dips from the duo of burly, buttery, bodaciously boss toast slices that came with them. The whites of the eggs were pillowy, breaking gently at the touch of fork and tooth, the seasoning dead-on. 

Pamela's must employ Zen Masters of short order cookery; there is no other explanation for such uncannily made staples of morning fare. These culinarians are warriors, the best of the best, the kind trained clandestinely in remote locales that involve fire pits, spiked whips, throwing stars, poison arrows, and monks wielding quarterstaves. 

Kay had Gail's Favorite Eggs and uttered not one complaint about them, eating quietly, seriously like a scientist studying the human genome; the mark of a superior meal being consumed.

Now it was onto the main event: A Pancake Tag Team Match.

In this corner at a total combined weight of errr...several pounds, The Chocolate Chip Banana and Strawberry Hotcakes.

In this corner at a total combined weight of...none of your business, Darren and Kay!

You get two pancakes to an order, each of us taking one Chocolate Chip Banana and one Strawberry.

Of repeating this maxim, I  tire not: Pancakes are dessert, a reward at the end of the rainbow, something to build towards, not a main breakfast course. Eating them with meat and eggs is a crime for the proteins distract from the lusciousness of the flapjack, Pamela's being especially so. Crepe-like in their thin structure, delicately crisp on their margins and exterior, palatial and butyraceous internally, I was positively enraptured. 

The Strawberry Hotcakes are pumped full of brown sugar, sour cream (and that is so exquisitely Polish), and of course the freshest, most plump, juicy, and sweet strawberries. Clouds of whipped cream adorn them. The other sleeping bag of batter not only had whipped cream atop it but inside it as well, smothering the perfectly ripened banana and melted chocolate.  No syrup required. 

A Pamela's breakfast is plateful of revelation: Simple diner food can be extraordinary. Fellow gastronauts,enlighten thyselves, journey Southward to Pamela's at dawn. 

P.S. The service was genial and more than competent.

P.P.S. Our tab was just under $25. Had we simply split one dessert pancake dish (again there are two to an order, so it's easy to do), the bill would have come out to less than $10 a person, making Pamela's economical as well as delectable. Good food doesn't have to be expensive. Pamela's proves it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why everybody thinks that this is a great place to have breakfast or brunch because in my experience the food is mediocre at best the service is terrible and quite frankly the restaurant is is dirty and there's no place to park."}
{"text":"Another Pamela's.  Type of place you love or it is just OK.  Had a group in for the Holiday's and though this would be good place to go.  I know Obama likes the pancakes which are thinner and like crepes, so I tried them.  Not my cup of tea.  But my cup of tea was good.   Also, tried a vegetable omelet, and veggies were still cool.  The Lyonnaise potatoes are good.  Place was crowded and had a line waiting for tables, then service was slow and had trouble getting the check.  

Decor is art deco 1960 combination."}
{"text":"A great place to take out of town guests as they are always pleased. That is typically the only time I venture to this Pamela's. It is a small location and parking is a hassle with the attached lot being super tiny. 

I typically get the morning after breakfast special, which is 2 hotcakes, eggs, and ham. It is always satisfying and hard to finish but nothing extraordinary. The hotcakes are just very thin crepes. I have also had the tex mex omelet, which was very filling but nothing memorable.  My friends always enjoy the stuffed hotcakes such as the banana chocolate chip, but I just find them too sweet. 

I will say their lyonnaise potatoes are quite delicious. I will make an effort to order a side of these if they don't come with my meal. Overall, I don't understand the hype about their hotcakes. It is worthwhile trying once but thats it."}
{"text":"Service ridiculously slow  there was only 3 parties totaling 7 people in restaurant and I waited over 8 minutes to be recognized and was never even offered coffee 
I politely said thank you and left without eating a thing.  They need to add more help and be more efficient.

Gave it one more chance complete opposite 
Service was great and so was food"}
{"text":"Yikes the hotcakes here are FREAKIN FABULOUS!!!! I'm not kidding. They're def in between a pancake and a crepe-- large and not super thick like a crepe, and yet fluffy with pancake texture. There was a brown sugar crispiness to it. The blueberries were fresh and not of the jam variety. No need for syrup. Amaze...balls. 
Chorizo hash is also a super win. Spicy and filling!"}
{"text":"I had their pancakes-the ones some rave about. PAMELA'S: Please understand  this-- I don't like greasy food. My pancakes were practically doing the backstroke in grease, and not at all gplden brown or even crispy.   I didn't see the server, nor did she check back. I was outside, and a guy (dishwasher?) poked his head out, so I asked him to get a server. No server. After 10 minutes, I paid inside and left.

Coffee was decent. Passable. 

Sad to see Pamela C. (Owner) was all OVER  Larissa's review from 7 months ago. Me? Not a peep from her. Sad, but not surprising. Why reach out to an unhappy customer to try to do better, or make her happy? That would just be good business acumen."}
{"text":"The banana pancakes are so clutch. Friendly fast service and excellent ice tea also reside here! Check it out."}
{"text":"Their pancakes are amazing! I do however, agree with the other reviews on here that say that the cooks have a tendency to be  over the top when it comes to the fat content of your meal. I'm sure that it's possible to get something somewhat healthy on the menu but that's probably not why you would come to Pam's. If you want egg whites, broccoli, nuts and seeds for breakfast ...You probably shouldn't eat here. But, if you want the occasional (and I mean occasional because you shouldn't eat this way all the time) light pancakes fried in butter and then stuffed with fruit, sour cream, and brown sugar with whipped cream on top (YUM!) then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Did you know you could get healthy options at Pamela's? I sure didn't! Although I would love to stick my face in a plate of their Lyonnaise Potatoes, I'm trying to be good (snooze). 

I recently discovered their spinach and feta omelet, which I love, so I just health-ied it up with egg whites, whole wheat toast sans butter (because they tend to be heavy on the butta) and a side of fruit. And you know what? It was still tasty! I was even surprised how awesome the fruit was! It was a big bowl full of delicious banana's and strawberries! They also have turkey bacon and sausage. I was tempted to add that one, you know, for more protein, but I stuck with my little satisfying dish.

This location is very tiny, so I'd strongly suggest going during off hours. I've been during peak and you wait forever! Plus, there's very limited parking on the side of the building. And most importantly, it's CASH ONLY, with no ATM for a couple blocks.

So eat up, with loads of delicious calories or not!"}
{"text":"When the in laws come to town I automatically think yay we are going to Pamela's!  Their Lyonnaise potatoes and strawberry crepe hot cakes are delish!   The potatoes are fried with onions and the crepe hot cake has strawberries, brown sugar, and sour cream rolled up then whipped cream on top!  

If you go for breakfast on the weekends be prepared to wait a little bit for a table then the food takes about an additional 30 minutes.  It's totally worth the wait in my book!  Everyone is so friendly at this location too!  CASH only peeps."}
{"text":"Love those crepe style pancakes!  Never had ones like them and I really enjoyed them.  It can be very busy on the weekends but if you aren't in a hurry I think it is worth the wait.  The strawberry hotcakes are my favorite.  They have fresh strawberries, bown sugar, and sour cream in them.  SO GOOD.  The waitstaff is probably one of the highlights.  We take our daughters there and the waitstaff is wonderful with them (dancing in the isles to entertain them!).  This will be my go-to brunch place."}
