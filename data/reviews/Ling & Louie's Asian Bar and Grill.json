{"text":"I have been here a few times tonight was an exception as I was waiting for a to go order in the bar my bartender Theresa was exceptional. She made me a Mai Tai which was very good while drinking it I found a different recipe and without hesitation she made it to perfection. Theresa IS my bartender from now on. I have drank in bars from Quebec City to Panama and my friends she's the bomb. Yes Jack she's better than Cindy. I forgot the food was good."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this spot! Really good food and the service really made our visit special! Seafood hot pot was delicious simmered in a coconut curry broth. Frozen Thai mai from the bar was so tasty especially on a hot day! 5 stars all around, check this place out"}
{"text":"Ling & Louie's is getting one start from me for very poor customer service. I ordered take out last Friday, the place was busy and the bartender handling the bar and take out orders was overwhelmed. After waiting for him to acknowledge me, he handed me the bill and got my order. I paid and even gave him a tip (which I now regret) because he didn't return my credit card. Mistakes happen and it's as much my fault for not realizing I didn't have my card. The problem is... I called the next morning and told the person who answered the phone what happened, he said \"oh yeah, we have it\" - that's it. When I drove all the way back to pick up my card... I walk in and the same bartender who kept my card was there, I said... \"Hi, last night .....\" he said nothing... he just looks at me, hands me the card and says \"thanks\"... FOR WHAT???? No apology, no nothing... At the very least, the guy could have apologized.  Not sure I'll be back...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time in 1/2016. We shared the sizzling shrimp & scallops along with the orange peel w/crispy spinach and rice dish. We loved the flavors of both dishes and couldn't say one dish was better than the other. We'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Well menu looks promising so off we go. One order of coconut shrimp, noodles and beef , noodles shrimp and chicken. 2 margaritas and a beer.  The shrimp was tasty , noodles were fairly good but margaritas lacked something, alcohol! . Extremely poor attempt at a margarita. Now was the time to see if the service was all talk and no action if you actually did not like something . The waitress attitude was that's how we make them and not a lot she could do. But when pressed she talked to the barman and we received a much better margarita.  So overall food was average and service lacklustre"}
{"text":"Great potstickers. I had the Kung Pao Beef however it was served more Korean style meat with the peanuts all chopped up tiny like you would sprinkle on an ice cream. I prefer it traditional with bigger peanuts. My other guests had a great meal and the chicken miso soup was AMAZING. great service and atmosphere. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was actually happy hour which they have from 11-3 on Sat and Sun. Service was a little slow to greet but other than that he was spot on and made some great recommendations. The Asian Nachos (1/2 price during happy hour) were amazing! Crunchy, cheesy, spicy...just the way nachos should be including this tasty hoisin BBQ sauce and Asian guac. The flatbread and sushi on happy hour are also a steal at 1/2 price. The only complaint is about the Moscow Mule we ordered which was not a purist version of the drink which is okay but there was no description on the menu to lead us to believe it was an Asian fusion Mule. Overall, good food and service, great happy hour specials plus a cozy patio to boot! We will definitely be back for a weekend happy hour sometime in the near future."}
{"text":"Exceptional restaurant.  Ling and Louie's styles itself as where \"modern Asian meets American comfort food,\" and the menu does not disappoint.  They also offer a new drink menu, and I had the Pak Chee Martini, delicious!  My husband was thrilled with the draft beer selection and that it was very cold!  There is a \"Lou's Brew Crew\" draft beer promotion for July where you can receive a glass or t-shirt for drinking certain drafts, how great!  For food, I ordered the Buddha's Feast with Chicken (substituted with shrimp) and the flavors were full and varied. Shrimp extremely tender and the asparagus, mushrooms, and red onions were perfectly prepared; loved the hint of Thai basil.  My husband ordered the Sizzling Blackened Chicken & Pork.  Again, incredible flavors; blackening added flavor without overwhelming the chicken or pork tenderloin, and the jasmine rice on the side was the perfect complement.    No room for dessert but we had our eye on the Chocolate Volcano, which we will most definitely have on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Hostess was extremely rude; she just walked off without saying anything after we told her the number in our party. Most people would be like \"please follow me.\"  Ordered drinks - pear martini (fairly good) & strawberry limeade (limeade was terrible, had an awful aftertaste & it had an identity crisis, didn't know if it was going to be sweet or sour...)  Ordered 2 fried rice dishes, which ended up being extremely salty. Would not recommend...  Only good thing about the whole experience was that our waiter, Doug was really nice."}
{"text":"Ling and Louie's is the best place Eva I don't care wat people say. Food, service and drink are unforgettable their life changing."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to eat here this past Saturday around 9pm, just to kill some time before we went upstairs to Airia Nightclub.  We were a group of five and since there was an hour wait for a table, we opted to sit at the bar.    Food: I didn't have time to peruse the menu since I was too busy chatting, so I chose the first thing that caught my eye - the New Wave Pad Thai ($13.99).  The other gals ordered the Korean Sizzling Salmon ($14.99), Thai Mussel Bowl ($11.99), Spicy Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll ($9.99), and the same Pad Thai dish.   I was pleasantly surprised by the generous portion of my New Wave Pad Thai; it was enough to feed at least two as a full meal.  There were plenty of chicken breast chunks and shrimp.  The sauce was a bit on the tart side, and although not a groundbreaking dish, I enjoyed the flavor. (See pics.)  The portions for the Spicy Ahi Tuna Tempura Roll and Thai Mussel Bowl were also generous.  I tried a piece of the sushi roll and was not impressed; the \"tempura\" was too crunchy, probably a result of being over-fried.    Drinks: Four of us tried the Forbidden Dragon (looks like a Mojito / $7.99) and the other tried the Frozen Thai Mai (not Mai Thai, mind you / $7.99).  The Forbidden Dragon consisted of pineapple rum, mint, lime juice, pineapple juice, and was served with a floater (shot) of absinthe.  My drink wasn't strong enough for my taste, but still, I liked the flavor - had a hint of licorice (from the absinthe).   Pros: - quick and attentive service by bar staff - generous food portions at reasonable prices - interesting menu with lots of choices - located downstairs from Airia Nightclub   Cons: - lack of ambiance (too bright and smoke/noise from the casino floor filtered in through the open spaces where windows should have been) - not enough alcohol in the specialty drinks"}
{"text":"Do not confuse this place with a restaurant. It's bar with an incomprehensible assortment of foods that just are  not good when compared to real restaurants.   A far cry from good restaurants."}
{"text":"Better than PF Chang's. There is nothing I don't like about this place except I wish it wasn't such a hassle to have to walk through the casino. Drinks are great , portions are more than generous , and who the heck doesn't love a mongollion beef made with freaking filet mignon?! This place can get a little pricey, but you cannot beat their lunch specials! I love the small and intimate atmosphere, the bar is even great when it's a little crowded in the dining room. As far as some recommendations they are as followed- honey walnut chicken or shrimp. Mongollion beef. House chow mein. And you must get the coconut shrimp that has a mango salsa that will blow your mind. Love love love!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend has taken me here twice and I really loved the food both times. It didn't take long after we ordered for our food to be done. The strawberry limeade is a DELICIOUS drink but I didn't really love the miso soup, wouldn't order it again. The dish I ordered was the beef and broccoli...AMAZING both times. First I ordered it with fried rice which was okay, the second time I ordered it with regular brown rice and this was better. I just felt like I could enjoy the perfect flavor of the beef and broccoli more when the rice \"had a little less going on\".   We will definitely go back to Ling & Louie's for the food (and the limeade) but I really can't say much about the service here. The hostess was friendly both times but the wait staff wasn't great to us either time...not rude but nothing to rave about either. Also it was a little awkward for me to have most of the staff in my direct line of sight standing in the kitchen area either A) eating, B) fooling around with coworkers, or C) standing around doing nothing...both times we were there.   The food is awesome though, so we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Our server Trixie was AWESOME!!! We tried the Thursday Combo Heaven daily special. What a wonderful sampler. The firecracker chicken tacos were delicious with just enough spice. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Per tradition the birthday celebrator gets to pick the dinner location; the choice this year was Ling & Louie's.  Only two of us had dined there before and the recommendation and menu were certainly tantalizing.  After some miscommunications regarding the reservation (well, the two reservations that were somehow BOTH forgotten) we sat down, perused the menu and started calling out what tempted us most.  We ended up opting for a family-style feast so we could sample a bit of everything.  The service was absolutely excellent.  No question.  Our waiter worked with us crafting the best selection of dishes, making modifications to dishes and cobbling together some special requests.  As the appetizers were delivered I was slightly disappointed; somehow I'd gotten the expectation that each dish would be a fusion specialty in and of itself.  Instead, the selections were more a survey of different Asian cuisines (with a few curve-balls thrown in for good measure).  The Beijing Chicken Nachos were the absolute standout here, but none of the other options disappointed.  We struggled to find room on the table for our entrees.  The Orange Peel Chicken was exceptionally light and refreshing; a favorite of all.  The Evil Jungle Princess was another standout.  We passed on the seafood dishes due to food allergies, but I'll surely go back to try those at a later time.  We finished off our celebration with a shared Chocolate Volcano.  It was lighter than expected and perfectly blended the sweetness of the ice cream and fruits with the richness of the chocolate souffle.  All told, we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and each of us plans to become a repeat customer."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here, I had the Firecracker Chicken Tacos and I've been addicted ever since.  It's what I always get.  I'm not usually into spicy food, and these are just right- a little spicy, but not so spicy I can't stand it.  I think the Bleu Cheese gives it a unique flavor for a taco, and all around these things are just too good.  I also love their crab puffs... real crab and tons of cheese!  So, so yum!    I just wish they'd bring back the duck flat bread... that thing was really delicious too.  If you eat in, be prepared because I have never, ever seen this restaurant quiet or empty, except for right after they open.  Otherwise, it is hopping and there's usually quite a few people waiting for tables... but it is totally worth it.   Their outside seating is really nice, and they do have heaters for those brief times it gets slightly chilly here :D"}
{"text":"Looking for Asian Fusion Happy Hour, this is your place.  Although several reviews seems to like the happy hour aspect of Ling & Louie's, this review is only for the dining and service presented after coming here twice.  The decor is clean, but decor seams a bit dark.  I suppose this is more for the ambiance of a bar and those enjoying happy hour.  I had the vegetarian fried rice which was nothing more than fried rice topped with fried tofu on the top.  I didn't like the presentation of the dish, but the taste was better than it looked.  My wife and the ahi sliders which were creative and tasty, but her toasted buns were a bit burnt on top.    Our waiter seemed to be friendly and present however after the bill was paid, you couldn't find him to get a refill on our water.  (I suppose this would be what is expected in an Asian restaurant)  ROA (Ratio of Authenticity) #Ethnic patrons/#Total Patrons = 0.1 (This includes my wife and myself.  Not very authentic, but if you are in the mood for Asian Fusion it is worth a try.   If you find this useful, cool, or funny, please check below."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices. The crab won tons are fantastic. A nice meal after shopping at the nearby outlets."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for lunch and dinner.  I love the creative fusion options-- and the fusion does not take away from the flavors you expect to find.  I'm a big fan of the honey walnut shrimp, and my wife loves the evil jungle princess.  Make sure to accept the up-charge and order the fried rice with your meal!  It's so flavorful!  Cute patio.  Buuuuut.... service, especially at lunch, can be a little slow (I hate having to wave someone down for a water or tea refill)."}
{"text":"This is Ling & Louie's flagship store which they are using to work out their concept so that they can franchise many more.  Unsurprisingly, they still have quite a few kinks to work out.  The cuisine is Pan Asian which is not easy to execute given how much variation there is.  Taipei Pepper Beef had a nice kick and the filet mignon cubes were beautifully charred.  The sauce was very tasty but don't know why they have to put it all over rice so that you have no control of how much rice to eat with it.  In fact, this dish needs way more rice given how strongly flavored the sauce is.  The Lemongrass Mahi Mahi was a big letdown after starting on such a high note.  The firm flesh of the fish just does not lend itself well to deepfrying and the lemongrass is such a delicate herb that all flavor is lost in the frying process.  The fried spinach leaves were not crispy and the sauces that accompanied the dish were sweet and boring - contrary to their tagline \"Not for boring people\".    Our waiter let the general manager know about our reaction and he immediately came over to speak to us.  He offered to take the Mahi Mahi off our bill and comped us another Taipei Pepper Beef to take with us.  Service is great and I'm hoping the food will catch up to it.  I'd definitely go back for the Beef dish and will hopefully have  a better experience with other dishes.  So until then..."}
{"text":"We eat here sometimes twice a week.  Always great food and excellent service.  The quality of the beef in all the dishes is amazing!"}
{"text":"Went to Ling & Louie's with a friend for dinner tonight to discuss upcoming photoshoots and design work.  We walked in and were greeted by the bartender, and then we waited to be seated for what seemed like forever.  Finally the bartender ended up seating us and was very friendly, however, once again we waited, and waited, for a server to greet us. I have been in the service industry for well over 10yrs and this kind of treatment of customers is just completely inexcusable.  I was glad I was in good company because otherwise I may have walked out. Once we were greeted by a server, she didn't seem very personable or attentive to out needs or making sure that we were satisfied. She didn't really even seem to care that we were there or not. We ordered appetizers and dinner. I was very pleased with the calamari that came with semi spicy sauce. I ordered the ahi tacos which were also amazing!  I was so stuffed that I didn't get a chance to try any dessert. If It wasn't for the awesome food I would have only given one star.  Not sure I would return unless it were just to hang out at the bar and only to be served by the sweet bartender."}
{"text":"Tried Ling & Louies for the first time, different than the traditional for sure. Service and food were both excellent. We tried the duck sliders,lucky lo mein rice, orange peel chicken & beef & broccoli."}
{"text":"I've been here when the food and service is spot on and husband and I love eating here. However, we were very disappointed tonight. Soup was like warm and too salty to eat. Server got the drink order wrong and served brown rice instead of Jasmine. Never checked back. Waited forever to get the check which was wrong. Waited another 15 minutes so we could get it corrected. Asked for the manager who was insincere with his apology and offered a $10 discount on our next visit.  He then came back with a re-adjusted bill and a $25 discount on a future visit. I hope they bring their standards back up.    Just visited again and they have redeemed themselves. The food and service were awesome. Haylie our server checked with us often, made great recommendations. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Chicken soup was especially tasty.  Pad Thai was a generous portion, lettuce wraps weren't the best but certainly passable. Will visit again."}
{"text":"First let me state that the only reason I am deducting a star is because I didn't like the entree that I ordered, but due to the fact that the quality of the food was great I would return to try a different entree on the menu. I also really enjoyed their lettuce wraps, so that would bring me back again. :)   The service here is amazing! Our waitress, I believe her name was Ashley (cute blonde girl) did a fantastic job! She was professional, knowledgeable, and personable. The manager was also great... He came to see how everything was, gave us a coupon and invited us back.   The atmosphere was very modern, cute, laid back and fun.   I really enjoyed my experience here and as I stated previously, I would return to try something different on the menu! :)"}
{"text":"Have been here on other occasions and had a just fine dining experience. We returned last night and had absolutely horrible service and management does not have a hold on anything. We will not be returning unless something drastically changes. It's rather expensive to receive horrible service and for them to be out of the several selections I wanted to order."}
{"text":"I did the check in..... now asking for a review.... I'm quite done...sorry Do Love this place.sooooooo much....!!!!"}
{"text":"The Asian Nachos are to die for!!!! My husband will go there specifically for the nachos. These guys have an amazing happy hour. They have a great patio to sit out on during nice weather. You also have to try the Calamari. It's super sweet and not like your normal calamari dish."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The food is creative and delicious.  The Pad Thai is amazing.  The customer service is good but what I mostly noticed is that it's SUPER clean!  I love that they offer some local beers too!"}
{"text":"The food was terrible! The kids chicken was charred to a terrible taste.   The noodles in the noodle salad were flavorless and the shrimp was tasteless. The kids noodles were charred and inedible. :( The service was so-so. ;("}
{"text":"I order the fire cracker chicken and it was just delicious!! The spice mixed so well! By far the best! I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight and got there ate 730. When we put in our name they said it was an hour wait, no big deal. After 2 hours they finally called us, at this time the restaurant was only half full. Prior to seating us the host told us the kitchen was backed up and meals would take an hour to get out. How is this even possible? My wife and I said this place sucks, that's when the host told us \"yes you do\". Wow, completely rude and ridiculous. Now I will never go back to anything associated with this casino, even concerts. DONE!!"}
{"text":"Honestly it has been good before but kind of greasy.  I ordered miso soup and it never came and wasn't on the bill,  and my wife's soup came out cold after her entree. Waitress said after the fact kitchen \"lost our ticket\". Terrible service"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!  I had tried Ling & Louie's when it first opened a few years ago and thought it was ok.  I gave it another try recently and have been back 3 times in 2 weeks!!!!  The Ahi sliders are to die for.  The service is EXCELLENT.  Paul the bartender is a GEM!  Hardworking, personable and clearly takes pride in his job.  His customer service is top notch!  I will continue to be a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch there this week.  Crispy scallops were delicious my dinning companions had the pad Thai and it was also excellent. we are anxious to return.   Service was also very good and they had a busy lunch crowd.  All in all a home run...and after our awful experience at Jade Palace we needed to to find a good, local oriental restaurant...hallelujah!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's still a bar and grill, but with an Asian flair. Sushi is pretty much vegetable or crab- it's not a sushi bar. But they've got great dishes. Salmon and sliders are my favorite. That and their spinach strawberry and candied walnut salad- to die for. The atmosphere is nice, nice enough for a casual business dinner, to take a client, out for a date, or family dinner. It's a bar and grill yes, but don't compare it to Applebee's either. It's much nicer, and more quiet. For servers, Danyel and Michelle are my favorites. Always smiling, and remember my drink and favorite dishes every time I'm in, so I always request their table if one is working.  Prices aren't bad either, nothing outrageous."}
{"text":"The service was top-notch, which is half the battle.  For a sit-down restaurant inside a casino, my expectations were limited.  I was pleasantly surprised to have had a good experience.  The appetizers were tasty and nice size portions.  The main dishes were  presented well and were also flavorful.  One thing I noticed was that they did not try to substitute spice for flavor.  The dishes were tangy without killing the flavors of the food. We will return."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the BBQ Chicken Flatbread- it was delicious! Everyone at our table enjoyed their food and I would return again to try more on the menu"}
{"text":"Horrible. I wanted to love my dinner here. The new casino is wonderful and I figured this restaurant would be as well. But, from our first order everything was far sub-standard. The worst was the sushi roll.  Seriously the worst piece of sushi I have ever tried. One bite and I could tolerate no more. The Lo Mein was no better.   I will never, ever eat here again. Please take my advise if you love good food and avoid wasting time and money here."}
{"text":"Not really Asian but an interpretation thereof.  OK for what it really is. If you want Chinese or any other type of Asian food this isn't the place for you. If you have a taste for Asian but want something different then this might be your place.  The Pot Stickers and Chicken Nachos are tasty starters and might be enough portion-wise for most. We also had Sweet and Sour Chicken which was very different from traditional S&S but tasted fine and the Firecracker Chicken with Broccoli definately had heat and was good. Food is plated with rice (at least in our case) so family style dining would be ackward at best. This is a local chain with 3-4 locations in AZ and CO.  Bottom line is that I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Ling & Louie, hmmm, I'm having a bit of hard time to define this place. The menu serves a wide range of Asian foods, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai and Vietnamese (from my first glance of the dishes and its names), then there is a full bar, Happy Hour menu such as Asian fusion 'flatbread' and 'tacos', it just made me more confused, a place serves many kinds of Asian food but nothing is specialized? Just because you put a description of 'asian sauce', makes a taco Chinese? Then there is this interesting looking clock on the wall next to the kitchen, a clock consists '12' on the top as normal, but the rest numbers are replace by a '5', that just made you start singing, 'it is five o'clock somewhere', and 'let's drink'! So yeah, this is a bar with many kinds of Asian fusion foods. Do not come if you are craving for a more authentic asian cuisine, that was my mistake, yeah..."}
{"text":"I don't give out 5 star reviews very easily, but when I go somewhere multiple times and it is always consistent, I think it is deserving.  Ling & Louie's is best described as Asian fusion, I mean there is meatloaf on the menu for goodness sakes!  But they do an excellent job modernizing some of the classics, and it is never greasy!  The orange chicken and crispy spinach is divine, the walnut shrimp so tasty, and I love the fact that they use filet for the beef in all their dishes!  It is always cooked so perfectly and the meat is so tender it just melts in your mouth!  They do a great job on appetizers too, potstickers, sushi and the soups are all excellent, especially the chicken and rice, it has just a hint of spice.  Their drink menu has lots of fun and fruity drinks too, but if you are looking for something nonalcoholic, try the fresh squeezed limeade....it is soooo good!"}
{"text":"I love their sushi as well as their pad thai. Of course it isn't a super fancy restaurant, but the food is pretty good for the price. The service is friendly and relatively quick, and the prices aren't bad, especially happy hour."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I have had since moving to Scottsdale.  I ordered Jeweled Beef and cleaned up the plate.   The filet was medium rare and oh so good.     I saw several things on the menu that caught my eye.  I plan on returning and trying them all."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing!!! First time eating here and we will definitely be regular customers! Everything we ordered was so flavorful and fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Great asian food! The nachos are soooo good! And the banana dessert is something everyone in their life should try! I've been a few times and can't wait to go back again! Four stars only because of the service...sometimes it's great sometimes not so great!  Alicia in the bar is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice and always great, favorable food! Good customer service and located in a nice area."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour with a few friends. I loved the atmosphere and had excellent service. The flat breads were my favorite. Only downside is the noise and feeling a little squished. Other than that, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We have been dining at Ling and Louie's regularly since they opened their doors for business.  Not sure what's happening but I'm thinking they have either changed management or maybe we just hit on bad days lately?  I used to give them 5 stars but as of lately bordering on 3 and 4 so I'll go with the 4  Friday and Saturday nights are almost always packed with waiting which is a good sign that the food is good. Tonight (Sunday) we went and the restaurant was not busy. Seated immediately and drinks and app ordered.  (Pot stickers should be parboiled before frying because the dough was chewy. ) Our order came nice and quickly but our server did not do a quality check and we couldn't see her to flag her down afterward to order some chili Sauce. My husband and our friend were finished their meals and he went and found a server to ask for some.  Then we ask for water which she brought for 2 of us but didn't ask or bring for all of us??  Server needs to be brushed up on the common sense stuff ...  we were all thinking maybe just a bad night?? But to be honest it seems things have slipped a bit on the hospitality side . Food is still pretty consistent and good. Portions definitely seem smaller then they were but to be honest they are definitely big enough."}
{"text":"I could literally drink their Tom Kha Gai like water. And their jeweled beef is like something out of a guilty pleasure romance novel. So sinful and good. Sometimes I add shrimp. But when that happens, I have to be rolled out in a wheelbarrow because I just can't stop. Plus Houston and Ashley are the best. Super personable and service is always ."}
{"text":"Love the happy hour menu...the food is awesome.  The food and drinks are yummy.  I love the outdoor bar and have met many friends here for meetings..  Great service and the bartenders always remember my name.  Kind of like the show Cheers...."}
{"text":"good food, prices, service and staff, very children friendly, always get a table although it is often full, great happy hour drinks.....only con is the last time we got child's menu with nuggets that seemed re-cooked and not as fresh as on previous times, but the manager was quick to bring another bowl .... of the same. Rest of the food was great!"}
{"text":"The meatloaf is excellent.  I recommend asking them to slightly burn one side - it gives a nice carmelization.  The sauce has a slight sweetness that goes very well with the Wasabi mashpotatoes....so good!"}
{"text":"Food looked great on menu. Smelled delicious. I stood there for over five minutes waiting for someone to even acknowledge that I had walked in let alone find me a seat so sadly I had to leave without eating. PS it was a Thursday night."}
{"text":"Ling & Louie's is a favorite place for me when at Wild Horse Pass doing some gambling.  I have had the ahi tuna, the firecracker shrimp and the orange chicken and all were delicious.  The service can be a bit slow at times, but always friendly and the food is always hot and fresh.  The fried rice (it's an upgrade...go for it...double down!) is worth it.  Soooo yummy.  And the food always tastes better if you can get it comped from your casino host.  :-)"}
{"text":"I use to enjoy this restaurant I had appetizers on happy hour which was good had a couple of Thai Mai and at the end felt I was over charged for both meal and drinks.  It's an expensive place to dine in."}
{"text":"I've been here twice before over the last few years and raved about the Mongolian Beef. It's been a while, but I had out-of-town guests and around 4pm on a Friday, hoping to beat the dinner crowd, brought them for an early dinner.  First, there is a new amazing front door.  A little heavy, but on the cutting edge of style.  It's almost like one large rustic wood slice of a revolving door.  Also, there is a new patio area with the bar a sort of indoor/outdoor which in Arizona weather is very crowded and fun. It was happy hour on a Friday and the place was beginning to hop. At first seated in a booth by the door we had to move because the glare of the bright sky from the bar was too much.  Reading the menus it was apparent the prices had gone up.  Well, OK, that was to be expected.  Appetizers were 1/2 off, though.  Cool. I had to mention to the waitress that my menu needed to be wiped off as it was sticky with obvious signs of dishes being laid on top of it on both sides. When the appetizer was brought out with the little individual plates, one of the plates had to be sent back because it arrived with a clump of food the dishwasher could not wash off. The food was delicious and since there were only a few tables filled when we first ordered, wait time was very short.  We ordered potstickers and they were great. Then we had mongolian beef and orange peel, which is crispy chicken or shrimp in a citrus-soy sauce.  All the food was outstanding.  We saved room for desert and shared both of the ones they offer.   They were fine, the ice cream being the best part of both.  About halfway through our meal the place started to rapidly fill up and the din was overwhelming.  We could not have a conversation.  I hadn't ever experienced this here before, but had dined on different days at other times.  The waitress and food runners and bus staff did an excellent job.  Fast, polite, efficient, smiling and gone.  When I got the bill I noted to the waitress that the prices advertised on the tabletop desert menu were old prices, noting that each had gone up a dollar, but insisted she let it go. I don't see how anyone could concentrate in that crowd with that noise.  The table next to us was within arm's reach.  There were no specific aisles left to make our way out, so we managed to get stuck in the no exit patio area.  We finally shimmied out behind the bar stools and people waiting to be seated had to shuffle over to make room for us to exit and not to get hit by the huge door which part of would swing inside.  One of the ladies was an extra \"fluffy\" lady, and the other elderly who walked unsteadily with a cane.  It was so immediately peaceful outside, that we remarked about the silence.  In my opinion, at least on Friday nights, this is a happening place to see and be seen and meet up and hook up.  I will try one more time on another day to see if the serene peacefulness of my earlier dining experiences has been retained.

{"text":"This place is fantastic.  We walked in and were welcomed by Neil who immediately told us about the happy hour specials.  We noticed that he greeted all of the guests with the same enthusiasm.  The drinks are priced very reasonably and the appetizers were phenomenal.  The crab rangoon (crab filled wontons here) were filled with real crab and came with a delicious sauce, the best we have ever had.  We also had the potstickers. They were very good, but the sauce was exceptional.  It was a similar to the ginger-soy sauce that usually comes with potstickers, but it was thicker without being sweet.  We didn't catch the other bartender's name, but she was great as well.  We will definitely be back again, this is a great place with a serious kitchen that works hard to earn repeat business."}
{"text":"Went there last Friday for Happy Hour and had the Coconut Shrimp as our Starter.  Absolutely delicious.   I had the Wango Mango Chicken while my mother had the Buddha's Feast with Chicken.  The Wango Mango has quite a kick and they give you so much food that we could've split one of them and still had some left over.   The Buddha's Feast was absolutely awesome!!!   I had the Mango Thai Mai to wash it down.  Yum, yum!!   I would definitely go there again and I plan to take out of town guests there for dinner. Food is great and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Working in Phoenix I decided to stay at the Wild Horse Pass hotel and Casino. Which I do not recommend. Before I went to my room dinner was needed. I walked around the casino and decided on Ling and Louie's.  the resturaunt is very nice. I sat at the bar and ordered a rickshaw margarita. It had a refreshing mojito/ margarita taste.   On the waitperson recommendation, I ordered the sizzling blacked pork and chicken platter. It came sizzling and definitely on a fajita style platter. (Applebee's style) the Vegetables were fresh and the rice was good. The platter was.... Just average. If the most memorable item was the broccoli then it missed the mark.   They did have a nice selection of beverages on tap. That made the meal memorable."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. The bread less calamari is my favorite!!! The service is always good! And there are so many healthy options if you want to go that route. You have to try this place out!"}
{"text":"I eat here two or three times a month. Service has always been consistant and food is excellent. Favorite is Fire Cracker Shrimp and the Green Tea is awesome! I look forward to my visits, but ponder why there is not more 5 star reviews. Thanks to Yelp! everyone thinks they are a critic! Too funny."}
{"text":"I went here with my family the place is decorated very well and is a perfect place in the casino. We were seated right away by your typical casino worker. The server came over and you could tell the service was going to be the same it was slow service that is typical for a casino no one in a hurry. The food was a different story it was amazing! The fm flavors were perfect if I am around again I will defiantly be back for the food."}
{"text":"We've eaten here/ordered take out about once per month since January and I really am a fan!  I tried the Kung Pow! Filet Mignon on the first trip and I haven't been able to order anything else yet.  They give you a good size serving and the filet slices are tender and delicate in contrast to crispy veggies and peanuts, the sauce is pretty spicy too which I love.  Husband enjoyed the Pad Thai on the first trip but has been hooked on the evil jungle princess with chicken since our second trip.  Service has always been great during our dine in trips and the frozen mai tai is so good it's dangerous.  I do plan on trying other menu items at some point soon (writing this as I wait for my husband to come home with our kung pow and evil jungle princess take out)......"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that we have ate at Ling & Louie's numerous times during our visits to Wild Horse Pass.  On Saturday January 28th we went to eat at Ling n Louies.. there was a wait they gave us a beeper it was approximately 7 o'clock and they said it would be about an hour and a half.. at 8:30 we checked in and they said there was two groups in front of us a three table and a two table and that the kitchen was extremely backed up and they wouldn't seat us until the kitchen got caught up. We finally got seated at 10 o'clock to eat dinner. I spoke to several people and no one seems to care that we had to wait 3 hours for dinner and they wouldn't discount our bill they did bring a free dessert for the birthday in our group and the food was good but I am extremely upset that we would have to wait 3 hours to eat dinner!!"}
{"text":"Four words: seven-hour happy hour. I've only dined in a couple times, but taking advantage of their $5 specialty cocktails while waiting for takeout is well-worth showing up early!  Although their extensive menu comprises mostly standard Asian-fusion fare, Ling & Louie's changes it up a bit with the addition of some \"American comfort food\" options for its less adventurous patrons.   Aside from the spectacular drink specials and speedy take-away service, L & L's best culinary achievement is its tenderloin - particularly in the \"evil jungle princess\" entree. If you like spicy food and high-quality meat, this dish is definitely a top pick.  Overall I'd say this place is a 4/5, but I give it a 5/5 as far as Asian-fusion restaurants are concerned. The service is consistent and the food never disappoints - Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place hands down is phenomenal. The food is always amazing and the service is superb. Today we went in as a large group of 9 and the server Tyler was incredible. He was extremely attentive and was clearly loved his job. The food had so much flavor and was perfect. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My biggest beef with this place is portion size. Their lunch portions are tiny and their dinner portions are only slightly better.   It's a good standby if nothing else sounds good.   The bartenders always seem rushed and out of breath - even when there is nobody in the restaurant. Kinda strange..."}
{"text":"Before our review...I've got to say that I've never seen such extreme reviews.  People either love or hate this place and that almost dissuaded us from going but we thought we'd give it a try anyway.    The food is OK (certainly nothing special), the service is good enough but the ambiance is on the low budget side.  The pot stickers were over-priced at $10 for 6 mediocre tasting pot stickers, the lettuce wraps were below average and not very flavorful at all.  The \"signature\" meat loaf was average at best.  The loaded sliders were better than average.  The winner was the french fries that came with the sliders...they were excellent but we don't normally patronage a restaurant because they have great fries.  On top of that, the restaurant is open to the disgusting smells of the smoke-infested casino, so there's no escaping the smell which, to us non-smokers, is a definite turn off.  All in all, there are about a thousand better Asian restaurants around the valley so unless you're stuck at Wild Horse Pass, you're bound to find better Asian food elsewhere for less."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give this location a try yesterday around 4:30.  We stepped inside and the entire restaurant and bar were virtually empty.  A young man came to greet us and we asked to be seated in a booth if possible.  The young man looks around and says \"I can seat you here in a half booth\" and point to a half booth near the entrance.  I ask again if we can sit in one of the booths on the far side of the room near a window.  He replies \"Those booths are for parties of six\".  We are astounded at his reply since the place is empty!  So then he says \"where would you like to sit\" without so much as a smile.  I replied \"in another restaurant\" and turn to my husband and said \"let's go\".  We ended up next door at Salt and Lime, had a wonderful meal with very friendly and professional wait staff.  After reading some of the other negative reviews I am glad we walked out.  We will never go back because of the way we were treated."}
{"text":"Just picked up a Togo order I'm starving I just took my state board for cosmetology today and ran back packed my thing and ordered bomb..."}
{"text":"Ordered the Thai mussels for lunch. There were about 4 dead ones, they didn't open after cooking like the others. I think the chef should've taken notice and replace those in the dish so I get the full order. However it was DELICIOUS! Service was fast and perfect in every way including fly-by checks. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Eh I wasn't to thrilled with the food here. The location, ambiance, and server was great! I had the Louie's calamari which was great! It was cooked perfectly and the sauce was a perfect. It wasn't too spicy, just had a hint of spice. I ordered the mongolian beef with fried rice. It's a very small portion but the beef was cooked perfectly; however, it was just way too sweet for me. Mongolian beef is usually spicy but this had no spice just a lot of sweetness to it. To top it off I had more rice than the actual entree. I really couldn't even tell I was eating fried rice because the sauce from the mongolian beef drenched it. It was just way too much sauce for me, maybe next time put it separately. Would I come here again? Maybe but not too much expectation the next time."}
{"text":"We stayed at Wildhorse for a few days and stopped into Ling and Louie's for a late dinner. Plenty of seating for our party of 5 and the service was quick and friendly. We had the lettuce wraps and pot stickers for an appetizer and ordered entrees too. Overall good food. Some of the other reviews mentioned that the food was salty, I would agree."}
{"text":"I have been frequently visiting this restaurant for about 10 years now. My favorite dish is the Evil Jungle Princess Chicken & it never disappoints. Houston, Paul, Robbie, & Sherry are all very excellent staff members & Happy Hour Specials are excellent. One of my favorite go to restaurants. I always bring in my out of town guest to Ling and Louie's & they love it."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the tenderness of the beef in the Bai Gha Li Beef entrée. The taste in that dish was amazing! The server Alex was very helpful in her recommendations and I will definitely be back again very soon! You must check it out if you haven't already done so."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in Arizona I always make it a point to stop here for dinner. Granite I always thought it was called Lincoln Louies so I still call it that haha. I do not recommend the chicken pad Thai but everything else is fantastic. They always have great drink options... And have a great pour. Try the Japanese whiskey it's fantastic. Here are some points to remember:  - pad Thai no bueno - General lings was good; yum; very good!  - plain chicken and rice is a good choice - vegan plate was okay  - lettuce wraps are great - kikori whiskey is white (weird) - uncle fu is okay - Fried rice with ginger garlic soy is the way to go (get a side next time)"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had yet... The calamari was incredible as well as my \"surf &turf\" main course. I will definitely be coming back for more.. The service at the bar was a bit lacking, but once seated, our waitress was great! My wife had the Lo mein and was very happy with it as well."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the city..not a close second.."}
{"text":"This is one our favorite restaurants.  The food is delicious.  I have never had a bad meal.  We took a party of 10 there for my father's 85th birthday. I called in the morning and told them we would be there by 7. They were waiting on a table to finish.  We'll those people used squatters rights and wouldn't leave.  So we waited a long time for others to leave so they could accommodate us.  It worked out and with out a prompting from us the management made our evening very special.  They went above and beyond for us.  And everyone LOVED what they had ordered. Not one complaint from 10 people. L&L rocks!"}
{"text":"Although my original review still stands the business did contact me in an attempt to make it right.  I just wasn't interested in going back to the restaurant having been disappointed twice.  I do commend them on trying to make it right and believe they are genuine. I just won't be going back there."}
{"text":"Somewhat like PF Chang's but at this location you can gamble! The food is no gamble however, it features tasteful  well-prepared Asian fusion. I shared 3 of their starters with my wife (spring rolls,pot stickers and Mongolian flatbread ) and enjoyed them all. Also,the serving size made this a fully satisfying lunch."}
{"text":"Went there back in feb. with a party of  8 had two waitress one grumpy one happy. Food had seem to change from previous visit and not for the better. Won't be going back might try Tempe location."}
{"text":"Service is sub par. We weren't greeted upon entry, which is almost always a preview of how your service will be like. Although our server was friendly, he was not very attentive. I looked around at the other tables and it did not appear that servers were checking on their tables. Unless it's a Scottsdale thing where people like to be left alone.   Three stars is for the food. I want to be fair and the food is pretty good, not great, but worth a try. We ordered beef lo mein, which had the most tender pieces of beef perfectly medium rare; however, the entire dish had the burnt wok taste. Kind of like what it tastes like when the grill needs to be cleaned. The honey walnut shrimp was served on a bed of rice. Clearly the food here is served for individuals rather than family style. We shared everything family style anyway. Lastly we ordered the meatloaf. Not sure how this fits into Asian fusion and it was just okay."}
{"text":"Lunch was very good!  I had the Orange Chicken.  The chicken was crispy, and moist on the inside.  The crispy spinach was actually very good and helped give the dish some very nice flavor.    My friend had the Mongolian Beef.  Lots of flavor, nicely charred on the outside and moist on the inside.  This place is a higher quality Chinese restaurant.  It's not the cheapy Chinese food most people are used to getting."}
{"text":"Typical casual dining fake asian food.  Five spieces edamame- super excited about this because it was free with a foursquare check in and I'm a cheap asian, but it was cheap anyway especially during their everlasting happy hour Black orchid ahi- really mediocre, the soy sauce that came with was gross Evil jungle princess with chicken- completely overrated, basically a huge bowl of generic sauce and oil dump"}
{"text":"I had the privilege of getting to try out Ling & Louie's on Shea for work (yes my job is rough), and I really enjoyed it!  The atmosphere is casual and fun and the staff is SO nice. They were very accommodating and attentive. We got to sit next to the kitchen where you can actually see your food being prepared, so you know it's fresh.  The food was great. You can't go in expecting traditional Asian food or PF Changs. The food at Ling & Louie's is more of an Asian meets American Comfort Food. We started out with a shrimp & avocado tempura roll. I thought it was okay, however my friends thought it was fabulous. I was more of a fan of the Emerald Spinach Salad...fresh, light and freakin' tasty! You can't go wrong with strawberries, walnuts and blue cheese.  For entrees, we tried out the crab cakes and the Evil Jungle Princess, which is a signature dish that even has her own twitter handle (@EvlJnglePrinces if you're curious). I enjoyed the crab cakes, but loved the Evil Jungle Princess. It's chicken and fresh veggies in a peanut-red curry sauce.   And if you're in the mood for some drinky drinks, get a Guava Tea. It's Guava Rum meets Arnold Palmer. Light, smooth and refreshing...dangerously deceiving.  Definitely go check them out...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I craved Chinese food tonight (and let's face it, I'm a sucker for crappy Chinese food), I was hoping this place would hit the spot.  The decor was decent, had a good look. The overall theme was cohesive.  It's the food that missed the mark for me. I had the Crab Wontons for appetizer. They were.... eh. I couldn't tell if they were cold in the middle or if they were just in so much cold sauce that it sapped the heat from the fried goodness. The consistency was off too, I found the filling to ooze out all over the place, which was a little awkward considering I wasn't given an appetizer plate.  For the main course I had the signature dish, the Evil Jungle Princess Chicken with the fried rice. It was a disaster. I had expected a chicken dish with a side of fried rice. It all came in one bowl, like a trough of food. I couldn't really make any distiction between the fried rice and the underwhelming chicken dish. There was nothing  memorable about this dish, just a steaming pile of disappointment.  I will not return here by choice."}
{"text":"Calamari was tender and cooked perfectly.  It had a little heat, just enough to give it a slight bite, enough to split the meal.   Best Mongolian & Jungle Princess meal we had in a long time. The Mongolian beef was sauteed, tasty and tender served over white Jasmine rice. The Jungle Princess was ordered with brown rice and had grilled shrimp, it was bursting with flavor. I can understand why this meal made them famous! Also had a spicy Bloody Mary. Went at Happy Hour which begins at 3 pm.  Prices cuts with everything we ordered. Large portions too!  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Huge portions.  Had the chicken and shrimp pad Thai.  Excellent. Super friendly staff. Great patio!"}
{"text":"Yuck! Had dinner with a group of four on Saturday.  None of us would eat here again. Any other restaurant in the casino would have been better."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a bit different, it's like American Asian. The food reminds me of PF Chang's with a twist. It is priced normally at 10 to 15 bucks. I don't think I'll go back because there was nothing striking about it. However if it's your first time then give it a shot."}
{"text":"When looking for a new place to try I always try to scope out the menu before going.  The menu at Ling & Louie's has some awesome looking items on it.  When we first entered the restaurant there were no employees around to greet us.  It was initially confusing on whether we had to seat ourselves or wait for a host/hostess.  Finally someone walked up and greeted us and took us to our seats.  The server was pleasant and explained the restaurant well.  We ended up ordering the hand-wrapped potstickers, lettuce wraps, new wave pad thai, and miso soup.  I also had a ginger-lime margarita and 22oz Ling's lager.  The food was EXTREMELY disappointing.  The potstickers were by far the best of the items we ordered.  The lettuce wraps (not the lettuce) and the pad thai tasted so strongly of GAS from the wok that it was very difficult to swallow.  The pad thai was lacking flavor and spice and was just so overpowered by gas from the wok that any other flavors it may have had were unnoticeable.  This goes for the lettuce wraps as well; the lettuce they use is fine, however the chicken mix they wok'd was so gassy tasting that my wife struggled to finish it as well.  The miso soup was equally terrible as it was full of thin stringed seaweed.  Miso soup should not have more seaweed than liquid.  It was awful.  To top it off, I ordered my 22oz lager in hopes of having something to wash down the gas after-taste we were suffering through.  I received my beer 16 MINUTES after ordering it, and the bar was NOT busy, as this was a Wednesday night.  That to me is just unacceptable.  Drinks should be the quickest and easiest thing to get customers.  This restaurant receives 2 stars for good potstickers, and a good margarita, subpar overall service, and lackluster food.  If you like your wok'd food tasting primarily like GAS then this is the place for you!  Just not for us.."}
{"text":"Came for restaurant week as we were a fan of this place. Service was bad. Had a full on conversation about Carmel, she forgot I didn't like it, all over dessert. Getting and running the check took forever. We had credit card on table bc we wanted to go. She left it to go get check, then said she'd be back again. Seriously. Not to mention, she avoided us ordering restaurant week, had to ask for menu, and didn't get the said \"bonus\" for ordering. We just moved back to area and this was in rotation, not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Second visit to L&L.  The first was at lunch with a group of moms second with my family.  The service was excellent which is saying a lot.  They didn't have to ask what we needed they surveyed the table and kept the meal moving.  Which I appreciated since we had the three kids with us.  This is not traditional chinese, so get the asian nachos.  They are a giant appetizer very unique and quite tasty.  EVERYONE enjoyed their meals and the happy hour deals are pretty good.  I see more visits in my future."}
{"text":"The service was ok. The food was salty. The sushi was full of rice and not enough filling. The lettuce wraps were ok but pei wei has better ones that have more flavor other than salt. The reason for two stars instead of one was because my drinks were very tasty! I had the ginger lime margarita and the daily mule! I won't be back for the food or the service but maybe for the drinks!"}
{"text":"So we've eaten here twice.  Last night was our second time.  Each time I've ordered something different.  Trying to find that  one item on the menu that will become my absolute favorite.   Honestly, it's pretty good...its not the best in the west, but it's good and affordable compared to what I've eaten at other casinos here in AZ.  Greg is an awesome server and the Manager is a cool guy!  Thanks for taking care of that chic with that wicked hackle evil witch laugh that would frequently erupt throughout the entire restaurant.  One major complaint though...Please do not ever, ever, ever run out of SAKE again.  Not everyone will like the pear or plum sake.  You must ensure that you have regular sake on hand especially on a Saturday night.  Me and BF were ready to get lit and we didn't really care too much for the pear sake.   We'll be back again as I had my eye on something on the menu."}
{"text":"Happy hour is lacking compared to other location in scottsdale. Same with food quality. It wasn't bad but definitely miss other location since we moved. Service at bar was friendly."}
{"text":"We came here with a large group. 14 people. We had a reservation at 8:30 and we were sat pretty close to that. The waitress was perfect and even split the bill without asking.   The food was good. We got crab puffs they were AMAZING.  I got teriyaki  chicken. It was good.  The pear saki sucked though! :(   Everyone loved their food and they didn't mind our rowdy group of 14 girls who had been drinking the last 8 hours.   I would recommend this place for dinner."}
{"text":"This food was great! I wish the hotel here was a good of an experience. Happy hour was good, food was good! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars- attention to the tables. Bussing, pre-bussing, refills. Very slow. My friend to to take another friends water because she couldn't get a refill for so long. I'd love to go back!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the ginger margarita. Love the candied ginger served with the drink. The drink itself is so refreshing and goes down so easily. Dangerously tasty."}
{"text":"Ling and Louie's is one my family's favorite restaurants.  We usually go there or get pick up from there once a week.  Love the atmosphere with very friendly staff and fast service.    The food is always good with a ton of choices.  My go-tos are the firecracker chicken, Ling's meatloaf, and orange peel chicken.  Although I have never tried a meal there I didn't like.    They also have a great happy hour and lots of specials in the weekend. You won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Love to come for HH! Great prices, food & Drinks. The only place I like to do HH!!"}
{"text":"I wanna steal the manager who is on TV all the time to be a chef in my restaurant ;) The bathrooms are awesome and clean, and that is how one REALLY knows if a restaurant is good. Great food, big smiles, sumptuous drinks...what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I've been to Ling & Louie's a couple times now and I really feel it is a solid place.  The one thing that does make it stand out over places with a similar feel is their service.  It's great.  They really are attentive and friendly, which to me, is just as important as the food.  The food here really is A-OK.  I haven't had anything that's blown me away, but I have had some good food that isn't too expensive and leave me satisfied.  Last time we went I had the chicken and rice soup, which was light, but flavorful.  We also had the nachos, which were very unique and decently tasty.  I can't remember what I had the first time, but it must have been good because we came back.  Given that this restaurant is in a good location for us, I am sure we will be back.  I would say it's worth visiting and a nice change of pace from your typical chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Discovered this place a few months ago and have since been about 4 times - the wonton appetizer and vegetable fried rice are awesome and my husband loves the fish tacos. Pretty decent happy hour as well. They have a cozy little patio which is perfect for this time of year. Service is decent -- they're nice, but be prepared as your drinks and food could take a while. Not bad enough to deter us from going back as it's a great establishment and service can always get better :)"}
{"text":"Not sure why I'm giving them 2 stars.   I guess I'm just happy I didn't get sick from my meal at this faux Asian Restarant.  As several other reviews have stated, they use a ton   of salt or salty soy sauce in everything.   We complained but we were basically told that's they way it's made.   The server really didn't care that our meals were inedible.  On the plus side, the margarita was pretty good.  However, I don't think I have ever tasted tap water as bad as they serve!   My god, sever your little bottles of water not river water.  Again, another plus, I won the wasted $65 back on a slot machine.   I left financially breaking even but with a bad taste in my mouth, figuratively and literally."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem for vegetarians + the best service in town.   While we veggie folk know that most Asian places will substitute tofu for any dishes in lieu of meat, we also know it is hard to find a place where the tofu isn't a crappy tasting substitute that they don't really want to serve ...   This is not the case at Ling and Louie's. The fried tofu in just about everything and in every sauce is delicious. I kick it way up the spicy meter with 2 or 3 dishes of chili paste and mix that in with my (off the menu) Evil Jungle Tofu. It is so good that I am actually happy that the portions are too large for me to finish. I can nosh on this dish all night ... well after I've left the restaurant.   I'm a pretty simple beer and whiskey drinker, but I my wife loves the great drinks that they make here. They come in blue, red, purple, and green ... I don't know what's in them, but she loves them.  The servers treat you like family and are always extra nice to our little one. They don't put a hot plate in front of a 2 year old like most restaurants and have a vast selection of items for the mini me in your life. The staff is always quick to grab a high chair a few crayons and a fun kids menu.    Every time I've been, it's busy ... but not uncomfortably so. We're always sat quickly and never rushed. The decor is cool and it's casual enough for the entire family and nice enough to impress a date.   Don't miss out on this one. A real 5 out of 5.   - Jason -"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this restaurant for several years, but a lot more lately. Right now they are running a special menu with several different noodle dishes. I am crazy about the garlic noodle one which is very spicy. I have never been disappointed in the food or service here. I love their newly remodeled patio eating area, also."}
{"text":"We are regulars here and we truly love it!!! It's really good service and food (something you don't see often now a days). I always get the blackened chicken and pork vegetables on the side with white rice and I love it!!! In summary I love this place and I can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"First timer today for lunch. Great atmosphere and location. Had the orange peel chicken with jasmine rice. Delicious. Funny thing is that there was meatloaf on the menu. Definitely a fusion type restaurant. My lunch partner had a shrimp and scallops dish and he loved it!"}
{"text":"Best food in the state of Arizona.    Next level everything, sizzling skillets are out of this world.   Never had an issues with service either. 100% will be back."}
{"text":"Upscale, modern appearance and progressive with some really very unique dishes and specials. They have a variety of unique dishes and wines. Handled a group of 10 with no problems. Delicious food, great service and atmosphere, we will most certainly return on our next visit."}
{"text":"This is our Go To Neighbor hood Restaurant. . went 6-1-2016..  always has been great~~! but the Ahi Tuna Salad was a total Bomb. . Special Shanghai Scallops was a very small serving to split. . will be back June 11th for My Birthday. . Maybe~!!"}
{"text":"i love, love, love Ling & Louie's. we live close by and visit somewhat frequently and we've never had a disappointing meal or less-than stellar service. if you like seared tuna, the black orchid ahi tuna dish is super delicious and filling (the portion is huge!). i always have a tough time deciding between that, the monsoon chicken and shrimp, wango mango shrimp and drunken shrimp (i like my seafood!). oh, i will say this - the starters are pretty good but we were a little less than impressed with the ahi lettuce wraps - really wasn't our thing but i'm sure it's quite tasty to someone else. we actually brought the boyfriend's mom here when she was in town for 5 days - on her last night she insisted on going back to L&L for a second time in her 5 day visit! the cocktails are decently priced even not during happy hour. i think the thai mai is around $5 and it's a pretty sizable glass with a good pour."}
{"text":"Omg yummm ... I love that they have a lot of gluten free options and healthy options. Prices were pretty good for the area too. Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, great food and friendly service. I recommend the happy hour menu for excellent prices, especially on  sushi."}
{"text":"Food: Just another Pei Wei. This is not chinese food and it is drowned in salty sauce.  Service: friendly but only one waiter on a Sunday just couldn't keep up."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt one of my favorite restaurants in the valley.  The Chopstick Chicken Salad and Long Life Chicken Soup is life changing...Buddha's Feast with Chicken is also a personal favorite!  The service-servers here are all fantastic.  Kham, Marta, Laura, etc are all fantastic.  Very good value with excellent daily specials.  Never had anything I didn't like here.  Always a treat, and I eat here weekly.  Try it and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot, and if there is an open spot outside make sure to snag it! The drinks are ok, but the food is great. The poke appetizer I could've eaten as my entree. Seriously it was just that good! Plus the portion size was great. Also ended up ordering the mussels and couldn't have been happier!"}
{"text":"This is our family's favorite place for lunch or dinner. Everything on the menu is mouth watering. The ahi tuna is the best around!"}
{"text":"I remember it being really good even though the prices were a little high.  I was asked to suggest a restaurant for a family get together with out of town relatives.  We all agreed on L&L.  Reservations were made.  When we showed up there the place was closed with a note saying they decided to close on Superbowl Sunday.  Not nice having cousins showing up from all parts of the valley and out of town.  They had a contact number.  Why did they accept the reservation and then not contact to inform us they would be closed?  Bad business."}
{"text":"I went here recently with my family. Being seated in a booth, I have to say my first impression of the place was not great. It's never a good thing when restaurant booths are set up in a claustrophobia-inducing style, with the tables and seats so crammed together that the tabletop is way too close to your body.   I followed the Yelp app announcement and signed up for their email list in order to get the free lettuce wrap appetizer, which was decent. For my entree I ordered the Evil Jungle Princess with shrimp and fried rice. It sounded really tasty on the menu, but the dish ended up being very bland, and it all seemed kind of... mushy or overcooked. It wasn't the worst thing I've ever eaten, but I would not order it again.  Our server seemed friendly but wasn't the most attentive. My mom was waiting to get her water glass refilled for quite a while, and ended up just flagging down a different server. Overall not impressed with this place."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but not great either. Kung pow was passable, but chopped peanuts gave no flavor, chicken was lacking too. Veggies were nice though. Service was good.  Not many other choices way out here but will not be back to this one."}
{"text":"Very poor quasi-oriental food. The service was approximately on par with the food though the wait staff were very nice--just not very together. My suspicions began when our order of two dishes came out of the kitchen in fewer than five minutes, and was only half right. We had a Honey and Walnut Shrimp that was overly sweet and that was not improved by the mushrooms mixed with the deep fried, over-breaded shrimp, though the walnuts were nice. And, because this was the dish that was freshly made, after we pointed out that we hadn't order the Mango Wango Shrimp, it was hot. We also had an Evil Princess chicken that suffered from the same problem that most dishes made with thin strips of chicken breast and all dishes not freshly made suffer from. I had to struggle to give this restaurant a second star and unless I hear from a trusted source that they ate here recently and that it was excellent, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years however something has happened in the kitchen that seriously affects the quality of the food.  It is no longer as good as it was formerly. Over the last 3 months or so meats tend to be overcooked and their dishes are full of overcooked rice with little ingredients, such as broccoli, that the dish should contain.  Either the kitchen is trying to save money by cutting recipes short or perhaps they need a new chef.  We will not go there any longer.  This is sad because this place is near our home and we used to go there often, taking many guests there."}
{"text":"Love Ling  and Louie's.  Everything we ordered had great flavor!  They have quite a few items with a good amount of spicy hotness to it!!!   For those of you that prefer no meat, they also have choices on the menu where you can choose vegetables instead.  We had great service and our server was spot on with her favorites.  They also have a great happy hour in my opinion. The lettuce wraps and ginger lime margarita, were yummy, and love the outdoor patio and bar area."}
{"text":"Awesome, somewhat hidden gem in north scottsdale. Great, unique menu with many options. The vibe is always lively here and the place is usually loud and busy-- which i like."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for lunch, arrived at 1145ish and sat at the bar. There were two others sitting when I arrived. I sat there for 15 mins while the bar tender did not even greet me. I had to get my own menu from the wall right as you walk in, and the only way I knew where they were is because I saw 4 parties get sat and that's where the servers were pulling the menus. I was finally acknowledged after I had my menus. I then asked for an Iced tea, and it looked like I was bothering him for asking. Again it was about another 5 mins before I received my tea. He was too busy dealing with take out orders, and seating other people as they walked in. It was about another 5 mins to place my order and when I did he looked at me and said I drank my tea to quickly. Who says that? To top it all off there was a lady that walked in a few moments after I received my food and sat at the other end of the bar, and the way he spoke to her was astonishing. He could barley hear her as she was soft spoken while trying to order, and at one point he threw his hand up and said never mind lady. I could not believe it. He gave me his name but I'll keep it to myself as I am not that guy. Poor service and I was ready to walk out before I even received my tea. Will never come here with that type of service. The food was perfect tho so if you feel like being ignored and want to wait 20 mins before your order is taken, then this is the place to come and sit at the bar. Unreal!"}
{"text":"The wait service was HORRIBLE.  Seriously.  We had to wait about 15 minutes to even place an order for drinks and then another 15 minutes to get them.  Do they not know the bar is where you make your money???  We were in a party of 10 - which can result in a very nice tip if the service is even mediocre at best.  Not so much.  Someone who may have passed as a manager walked by and glanced at our table, but never bothered to ask how we were doing.    The tuna was good, but the sauce was salty.  The coconut shrimp were okay.    We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was prepared to like this place. Really I was. Very attractive exterior and cute name.  What a bonehead I was - should have done better research.  Ling & Louie's is as if P.F. Chang and Applebee's had a love child.  The result is unfortunate - a \"concept\" formula made expressly for \"franchi$e opportunitie$\", and there's nothing especially good or unique about it.  Friends don't let friends eat mediocre food."}
{"text":"I really love this place! I must eat there once or twice a week. Its a comfortable atmosphere and the food is not only very good, but reasonably priced.  My favorites include the ahi tuna lettuce wraps, and the tum yum soup. Their sizzling beef and surf and turf  was also delicious. They also have a happy hour that you cannot pass up cause its everyday!"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. First check and first review. This is a great place for lunch and dinner. The menu is a funny mix of Asian and American dishes that all hit home runs. My in-laws have to eat here every time they are in town.   Big fan of the fire cracker chicken and the meatloaf. Also, they have amazing potstickers. Happy hour has great prices and drinks are very reasonable.   I am a big fan of patios, and theirs is perfect. I highly recommend a try."}
{"text":"There were 6 of us that ordered our food \"out the window\" it took almost an hour for last members of our group to get  their order, and ours took almost 40 min. so I won't do that again. My tempura was lukewarm when I got it, so there is some sort of a break down with the staff. Every one else enjoyed the food, although it wasn't warm, and small portions. Thought it was on the pricey side for what you got."}
{"text":"So-so Asian Restaurant  A mixed bag at our recent Restaurant Week visit. Waiter Mike was cheerful and tried to please but service was very slow. It wasn't busy and there appeared to be plenty of staff but our beer samples took forever, then a looong wait for our lettuce wrap appetizer (how much prep time could there be?) Entrees were tasty and abundant. The highlight of the night was the Volcano Cake -warm, gooey, lovely strawberries topped with ice cream and whipped cream.  Patio looked nice and is dog friendly so we'll probably give it another try."}
{"text":"Went for lunch while visiting Phoenix and fell in love with the Wango Mango chicken. I just moved to AZ and can't wait to go back and try the other unique dishes."}
{"text":"Great Asian fusion restaurant, excellent and extensive cocktail menu as well, the frozen Mai Tai was delicious, had a hint of brown sugar or molasses, Mojitos were delicious as well.  The New Wave Pad Thai was delicious, full of shrimp, chicken, fresh veggies, tender rice noodles and the sauce was unique and very savory.  The Orange peel chicken, was crispy, tangy sweet and citrusy from the orange peel, moist chicken served with fried crunch spinach and brown rice.  The Evil Jungle Princess Chicken was a balance of hot, spicy, creamy coconut and curry a delicious savory dish. We also got the Uncle Foo's fried rice, a delicious umami blast with a unique soy sauce/oyster sauce flavor, and some sort of Malaysian spice, soooo good.  Huge portions, better share everything. Great service by a very knowledgeable wait staff."}
{"text":"Cute place, I went for lunch on a Friday with my coworkers. We were seated right away. The waiter was really nice, he explained the concept and menu to us. Most of the table got the shrimp lettuce wraps. The wraps were ok, the sauce was really good. I also got the crab wontons, I wasn't really impressed by them though. Overall, the food was ok. I can say that I tried this spot."}
{"text":"Ate here this past Friday and the food was delicious! Something that really stood out for me was the F'n Loaded Sliders. Filet Minion mixed with blue cheese and a bottom less basket of garlic fries! It was so good and the prices are not what you'd expect for such a delicious meal. Your getting P.F Chang's but without the hit to your wallet and in my opinion way better food. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Move on over, Pei Wei, PF Changs and Totties Asian Fusion!  Ling and Louie's is on my radar!!  I think, in my humble opinion, that Asian food is rather difficult to find here with any quality. PF Chang's is okay. Sometimes, Pei Wei is pretty good, sometimes, not.  Tottie's Asian Fusion location at Scottsdale and Lincoln Road's is pretty good, but the original has slipped.   Ahhhh, just when I was going to give up, I see Ling and Louie's!   What a delight this was from the get-go! Friendly personnel, a wonderful menu with Thai, Chinese and Japanese flair and selections. And quality, delicious food. Really delicious...  The Black Orchid Ahi sashimi was fresh and fabulous.   The entree we decided on was their Surf and Turf, which is filet of beef, sliced with lots of fresh shrimp, mushrooms and onions on a sizzling platter. We ordered a side of fried rice, which wasn't anything to wrote home about, but satisfactory. The Surf and Turf was to-die-for FABULOUS!   Definitely try this yummy restaurant! You'll never go back to the other Asian places..."}
{"text":"My bf and I ordered takeout and thought the food was just ok. I wasn't really impressed, I've had better  tasting asian food (I grew up in the Bay Area) and thought my meal had too much grease from the sauce. Idk, maybe I'd come back but I'd rather eat Panda Express for the same quality with a cheaper price point."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Ling & Louie's.  We enjoyed it.  The food was awesome, my 10 year year old daughter & I split the mussels as an appetizer, they were delish!  I had the seafood hot pot, it was some of the best green curry I've had & they don't skimp on the seafood.  My husband had the evil jungle princess with scallops & said the same thing about the amount of scallops in his dish.  The wine & beer list was good & service is excellent & friendly.  My only complaint is we were seated in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen, my clothes & hair reeked of Asian food when we left - eek!"}
{"text":"The service was fantastic and decently priced! Our sever named Chad was amazing! We ordered the crab rangoons, coconut shrimp, and potstickers to start! We then ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and the fillet with asparagus and mushroom! It was all so delicious. And you can't leave without trying the chocolate lava explosion for dessert!"}
{"text":"This restaurant kicked butt for our group of 12 when we came in for dinner on a Saturday night. Our reservation was for 7p and they were ready for us with a big table toward the back (I definitely recommend sitting as far from the front as possible - the open \"windows\" to the casino mean you see and hear all the casino noise and smell the cigarettes.)  I think Asian fusion is overrated to begin with, so I didn't find this place any better or worse than a PF Chang's or Bamboo Club, food-wise. The prices were on par with both those chains, and their offerings similar as well. I wasn't starving so shared the Ahi lettuce wraps and fried wontons (with real crab) with a friend. The wontons were excellent, not too greasy with a good balance of cheese and crab inside and wonderful sauce drizzled outside. The Ahi wraps were nothing special, in fact I found the filling to be nearly flavorless. Everyone else at the table was incredibly happy with their entrees - that included the meatloaf sliders, evil jungle princess (yes, she totally ordered it just for the name), and the sizzling salmon and asparagus to name a few. Aesthetically speaking, the sizzling salmon looked absolutely incredible and the perfect serving size.    Serving our large party went off without a hitch, and that is worth three stars alone. There wasn't a single order missed, late, lukewarm or wrong. Though we did have a mysterious order of chicken lettuce wraps show up randomly. I never had to crane my neck to flag someone down for another drink (again, really hard to pull off with a large party), and from the hostess to the server to the manager (who came by to help out and drop off a few items) were cool and genuine. And big points for asking us up front if we all wanted separate checks to avoid awkwardness/confusion at the end of the meal.   They get that fourth star for the really impressive service.   Great job Ling and Louie's!"}
{"text":"Tonight we stopped in again, cuz i just love this spot. Ordered the pad tai, chicken soup, and chopstick salad . All were delicious.  The salad was a tad over dressed, but our server and bartender, Brett, took care of this no issues! We will continue to frequent this place. With service and food like this!   Kudos to Brett and Matt for being amazing!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. At a time when there are waiting lines outside restaurants; Ling and Louie's was at most half full. We waited 5 Minutes for an employee to greet us and seat us. Not a great start. A round table for 6 was great but service poor. Ultimately the food was good but having to ask the server multiple time for refills or table setting just took away from the experience and as I said previously; restaurant less than half filled. Too many other choices in the area to even give this place a second try."}
{"text":"The place is very clean and everyone was friendly. The food is fresh and tasty. All four of us were pleased with our meals.   Laura waited on us and she was attentive and friendly. She knew the menu well and made good suggestions."}
{"text":"I SOOO badly want to give this restaurant a great review, especially because they have gone above and beyond to improve my experience.  Christine (of Ling & Louie) has been wonderful, sending me a couple of coupons, along with a list of her appetizer suggestions and a description of why each is so good.  She has followed up to ensure that I received them, and again to ask if I have visited the restaurant again.  I did.  I was back on Monday night.  I tried her suggestions.  And yes, the Black Orchid Ahi Tuna was terrific.  Really good!  The Ahi Lettuce Wraps I was much less impressed with, and the Emerald Spinach Salad was quite flavorful.  And the bartender (we were seated at the bar) could not have been more courteous.  And then.....  Whether it was the spinach, the raw tuna, or the chicken...we became sick.  Almost immediately, or within 20 minutes of the meal.  Thank goodness I have a 2 bathroom condominium!  So, Christine, I am certain you will understand when I say, I'm sorry, but I have two additional coupons that I will not use.  I went with the best intentions, hoping for the best but...I just can't.  I just can't change my review to anything more positive right now.  Thanks for your understanding."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants, but since we moved to another part of town, we don't get here very often. Last Saturday night, we had a rare dinner out, kid-free. Seriously, it's been probably a couple of years since it was just me and my wife out to dinner. So we visited Ling & Loui's. The food was great, as it always is, but what made this rare evening so enjoyable was Tanner, our server. He's so pleasant, happy, so good at his job and making us feel special. He was truly a part of the \"experience.\" Even a little thing, when we placed our order, we ordered a third dish to take home -- but asked him not to have it prepared until just before we were finished. That's an easy thing for a server to forget, but without us prompting him, he told us as we were wrapping up that he'd go ahead and place that order into the kitchen.  And he was that attentive with ever table we saw him at. Busy night, and he was fabulous."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and nice interior! Very friendly staff and very helpful. Excellent menu perfect for anyone whether you like Asian or not. I highly recommend embracing the fried rice with any meal and try to the Honey entree... One great fact, is that they can make any dish with tofu so it's very accommodating to any dietary needs. Looking forward to going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Been to the casino mant times and never tried Ling and Louie's till last night. The wait was an hour but no problem as we planned a little gambling first. We got seated in a booth and the service and food was spectacular !! We ordered the combo fried rice and the chicken yakisoba. Both meals were loaded with meat and the taste was amazing. We will be back !!"}
{"text":"Had lunch on April 10 with 3 others. 2 orders of Evil Jungle Princess by new diners received rave reviews. Others loved the honey walnut chicken and meatloaf. At noon, very busy and quite loud. Patio looked inviting but too hot this day to be outside. I prefer this restaurant to 2 other wildly popular Chinese places nearby. Since this was a special occasion, we were deeply disappointed that the chocolate cake dessert was unavailable due to an oven not working. We went to the ice cream store a few doors away and they had a few cakes/brownies, non-ice cream based, and they were wonderful, lemon and ricotta is what we ordered. None of us are ice cream eaters but their selection was very appealing. We will be back."}
{"text":"My daughter had lunch here and really liked their Caesar salad she said it was delicious and she also like the fact that they had lettuce wraps and low-carb options.  So we decided to have dinner here. Entering the restaurant first thing you notice is the large door that kind of swings open! Into a busy bar to the left.  We ordered the crab wontons for our appetizer  , it was delicious the sauce that came with the wontons was also delicious. These are probably some of the best crab wontons I've ever eaten. I had the emerald salad which is kale and strawberries, tomatoes pecans or walnuts either way they were delicious oh and it also had blue cheese. My daughter also had a salad that she really liked but honestly I was so busy enjoying my emerald salad I didn't catch the name oops!.  I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu! Our waiter was great and we even got another waiter to help us get our check paid quicker which was very nice of him."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is great here -- good specials for drinks and appetizers! We've enjoyed dinner here too.  Love the Evil Jungle Princess (chicken). I've had it twice.  Want to go back and try other offerings."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. We ordered the 3 sliders with fries, and they were amazing. The food was fresh and the meat was juicy. We also ordered the delicious orange peel wok. The citrus taste blows up in your mouth. Also, the pork fried rice was amazing. The pork was very juicy. The water was also good, especially with cucumber in it. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I went to Ling ad Louie's not knowing exactly what to expect.  It was like a version of PF Chang's but maybe a little more casual and with better food.  There was ample room inside and they had a nice outdoor seating area complete with misters.  I was alone so I sat at the bar.  It was Friday at about 6:30pm  but there were a reasonable number of open tables inside and out.  I would say it was about 3/4 full.  I started with the crispy calamari (got for Happy Hour price of $5!).  It was a portion large enough for several individuals.  It had sort of a mayo/ sriracha sauce drizzled on it and it was very good.  I coupled it with a 4 Peaks IPA....mmm I had the Kung Pow beef for my main course.  I guess I was expecting a low quality beef but was pleasantly surprised by the quality and large chunks (it seemed like filet but the server said it wasn't....maybe sirloin?)  It was super tender and the veggies were done just right too.  Service was excellent and it was a fun, festive atmosphere.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Really great food and happy hour. Our server Nathan was very helpful and attentive. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best Asian restaurant in Scottsdale!! The food is spectacular, and the service is ALWAYS on point!! My wife and I go there at least once a week, and we always have a wonderful experience!! If you haven't been there yet...you'd be a fool to not check it out!! Ask for Marcus...he's the best! (Although the whole staff is really good!)"}
{"text":"Because we had such a good experience in July, we decided to dine here again.   That seems to have been a mistake. Our waiter was personable and willing to comment on choices though I don't need to be told everything is a good choice or a personal favorite.   The calimari was stuck together (which I have never seen before) and luke warm. Was it prepared earlier and microwaved? The potstickers were chewy (which I have never experienced before) and not warm though they tasted good.  The lettuce wraps tasted good but two of the five lettuce leaves we're too small to wrap around anything so it was more open face than wrap The Mongolian flatbread tasted good but the ingredients were not evenly distributed. Some pieces had one or two fragments of topping with a sauce covering the rest of the space.  I had a provencal rose and tried a couple of the cocktails, all of which were tasty...best part of the meal.  Restaurants have good days and bad days. The place was not busy. Some staff were kibitzing at a table. I don't know how to account for the difference except to think the kitchen might be inattentive."}
{"text":"Really don't understand why there are such high reviews for this restaurant. The ambiance is nice and the bar area is quite inviting - but the food - truly sub par. Gloppy, overly sweet sauces, inconsistent and confused seasonings (I suppose the work \"fusion\" is supposed to excuse this - it doesn't) overly solicitous wait staff typical - corporate fare dumbed down for unsophisticated American palates. If you've ever been anywhere in Asia and experienced what true Asian food should taste like, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Place was ok, kinda small to have a business meeting with corporate executives. Had all the appetizers, nothing really was special."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Half expected a lame PF Chang wannabe so was very surprised at how excellent and fun it was!  Specials were terrific and cheap, and the bartender Paul made us some of the better drinks I've had in town."}
{"text":"I've been to Ling & Louie's a couple of times for lunch only and was never disappointed. The \"Firecracker\" is a great blend of spice/heat with blue cheese...definitely not your typical Chinese food (of which I generally don't care for), but incredible. If you get there early enough for lunch, there is a good chance you'll get amazing service. Otherwise, as it gets a little more crowded you may have to wait a bit, and take your time. Leave any impatience at the door, because from my experience the servers are friendly but busy, and the food is really quite good."}
{"text":"If you don't mind restaurants that rely heavily on deep fryers and copious amounts of soybean oil in a wok to cook food, then you may like this venue.   It is Asian style, but it is certainly not authentic in any way. I only went there because I looked at the menu beforehand and thought there were a couple 'safe' foods I could get that couldn't possibly get screwed up by anyone.   The ambiance is okay. It seemed a little dark and dank, a little dirty, a little \"Ew, what is this on my chair?\" It's the type of venue where after handling the menu you look around desperately for a bathroom to clean your hands with the concentration of a surgeon.   I ordered a California Roll and a salad as my meal. My hubby ordered the appetizer-sampler-type option and walnut shrimp for an entree.  The appetizer came out with crab wontons, pot stickers, and shrimp. Everything was greasy and oily, the wontons and shrimp heavily soaked in oil. I know lots of restaurants are slaves to their deep fryers, but this was clearly soaking in oil. To the point that even my non-discerning husband was afraid to eat the entire plate because of the potential havoc that may occur later in the intestines.  So, after passing on the appetizer, out came my 'California roll' and salad. The salad would have been okay, but there was sooo much sugary 'raspberry' dressing on it that I felt like I was eating candy. Topped with candied walnuts and yellow, dried out chicken.. it didn't float my boat. The California roll was clearly not rolled by anyone who does that for a living. It was mostly long grain rice packed around a teeny tiny amount of cucumber, avocado, and imitation crab in the center. I don't quite know why it tasted so off, but I couldn't choke it down.  My husband did enjoy his walnut shrimp entree. He thought it was as good as any other he's had from other restaurants.  I must mention that our waitress, Trixie, is probably the best waitress we've ever had. She was so kind and polite, took her job seriously and really strove to make our dining experience pleasant. I felt horrible saying anything bad about my meal because she was so awesome. However, Trixie is perceptive. She could see it on my face when I wasn't satisfied with my meal and without question, she offered us a dessert to make up for it. What a surprise!! I didn't expect or ask for anything and she was so observant and eager to please. My husband and I really valued and appreciated her excellent service and I hope they treat her well at work.   My advice - Go for Trixie, not the food. ;)"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place.  I usually go at night with a group of moms and we love it.  The food is very good.  I finally tasted the Evil Jungle Princess Beef that my friend raved about.  It was really delicious.  I love the Black Orchid Ahi Tuna. I went for lunch with my husband and we had a great time.  The bartender, Paul is great.  My husband's house margarita was really good.  The prices are so reasonable.  I can't wait for my next moms night out."}
{"text":"Rockin good food here! We had calamari, seared ahi, lomein with tenderlion of beef and wild rice soup....all excellent! The banana thingie for desert was soooooooo good you gotta get it. It's a $15 desert but out of this world worth it!  Houston was our server and he rocked as well!"}
{"text":"I live nearby here so it is great that they offer take out! I have tried multiple menu items and highly recommend the Korean salmon and the surf and turf. I also really like the crab crunch sushi roll it is delicious as well. The bartenders are also all super friendly and provide great service"}
{"text":"I had the chicken fried rice (yeah, I know--boring).  However, all the veggies were amazing (crisp green beans rather than soggy/overcooked ones) and so was the chicken (all white meat and tender).    This place isn't \"authentic\" at all but if you're looking for yummy, high quality product...then this is your place.    They also have a great take-out system that is quick."}
{"text":"I picked up an order for take out and the bartender in charge of take-out was a total JERK! (his name is Paul according to the receipt) Food was pretty good, pricey for the portions but I don't need attitude when I'm spending my hard earned money at their establishment when I could easily have gone elsewhere! Management needs to get on the ball because I'm not the only one who feels this way about \"Paul\" and NOBODY should have to deal with an ass with attitude! He didn't even say thank-you! I will not return...there are plenty of other restaurants just as good or better where the staff is grateful for my business and friendly to their patrons!"}
{"text":"You have to have a frozen thai mai from here! They are amazing. I also order the honey walnut shrip minus the mushrooms. The bartenders are amazing and always ask if i have a food allergy to mushrooms and will put it on the ticket. The bartenders are very friendly which is why ive never sat anywhere but at the bar."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely friendly.  I ordered the cashew chicken.  It was so light and fresh.  The sugar snap peas were so crispy and sweet.  The sauce was not heavy at all.  Everything melded together beautifully!"}
{"text":"Love Uncle Fu's Combination Fried Rice...great for breakfast, too!"}
{"text":"We found ourselves in this area and someone suggested we stop in  The casino and go here for lunch. We were seated right away and the staff was very pleasant and attentive. The menu is smaller than the usual Chinese restaurant menu but the selection is still quite good and they offer a small selection of lunch specials.  We started with crispy calamari which was quite good. I always seem to end up with rubbery calamari but this was not case here. I ordered the orange chicken lunch special which came in a bowl over brown rice. It was perfect serving size for lunch and reasonable for the location at just $9.00. The other diners at my table ordered full size entrees which run between & $15.00 and $19.00 depending on the protein you add and twice the size of the lunch special. Everyone's dishes looked tasty everyone enjoyed their meal.  You do get a bit of the casino noise in the restaurant but not enough to distract from you meal."}
{"text":"Eaten here more times than I can recall.  Food, Service, and Atmosphere have always been a 10/10.  Highly recommend the calamari and the evil jungle princess (beef).  However it is one of those restaurants where you will want to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"My family and I were in Ling & Louie's this past week.  We have always liked it as it is fast and can get us through in a quick time- which is good with kids.  This week was off though.  Not sure what happened.  We did not see our waitress very often and kept trying to order.  She did get the kids meals in early at my request.  But when they came out- they just didn't give my son the French fries he ordered and left an open container in his bento box.    The Surf and turf was my favorite by far and the first time I have tried it.  I will get this again.  I will go back but we were trying to get through quicker and everything was very slow that evening.  It made for a late night on my daughter's birthday."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Food and service was top notch! All the ingredients were fresh. Atmosphere was pretty good considering it was at a Casino. I was raised in Vegas so no surprises for me in that department!   The combinations of flavors in the various dishes ordered left me feeling like I had traveled to another country in my mouth! The chef staff really know their spices! The menu is friendly and offers a wide variety for different tastes including sushi! The prices are reasonable and you get a good amount of food for your money. Good bye PF Changs....This is much better food!  http://spoonfulpersuasion.blogspot.com/"}
{"text":"I enjoy Asian fusion, but this was disappointing.  First, we had to wait 25 minutes to be seated. Which would be fine if it was worth that wait... Started with a cocktali which was highly recommended by the waitress. Shanghai Tea or something like that? It was nothing special. We ordered some Edamame to start, and it never came. I guess someone forgot. Very unfortunately considering how hungry we were.  I had the orange chicken, which was okay. It was too salty,didn't really taste like orange chicken so much as salt chicken... so I wouldn't get it again. My husband got the Evil Jungle Princess Chicken and he didn't seem blown away by it. I tasted it and it was not that flavorful. Dessert was probably the best part. We got the banana spring roll, and it was pretty tasty.  I don't think we will bother going back."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and it wasn't busy at all. Had to ask for menus. The bartender took our order and my wife and I both asked for soup before our food came out. Her order came out and they brought the wrong order for me. The bartender thought I ordered that and it didn't sound anything what i did order. My wife is almost finished with her meal cuz I didn't want her to wait for mine and hers get cold. They finally bring mine out and it's bland and it's supposed to be spicy. Then they asked if we needed anything else and I said our soup we ordered in the beginning like an appetizer would be nice.  They finally brought that out and that  is supposed to be spicy as well but was not.   Was not the experience I was hoping for. My wife's dish was delicious but that was about it. As we are trying to pay our check she still proceeded to over charge us!!  Meanwhile 2 spots over are dirty dishes and a lady comes to sit down and she ask the bartender if the spot is open and the bartender says yea why are you going to sit there. The lady says if was clean I would.  The bartender said I guess ill clean it and acts like it was a hassle for her to walk around the bar to clean the dirty dishes off the bar. Then she tosses a menu down and the lady says really, the bartender reply oh yea did you want it wiped down too!!!  not the best service we got."}
{"text":"Good food, great happy hour - all day!  The beef and broccoli is made with wok charred filet mignon.  Very tasty!  I like the ahi salad too - above average.  Nice menu - lots of creative dishes."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for a good Chinese spot in AZ since I haven't found one after the Flo's in Sky Harbor closed. I got pad Thai....i know, i know...not Chinese. It was decent. Not California caliber, but I'll go back. My friend had fried rice with extra meat, she ended up paying more for her meat than the original fried rice...pretty crazy. But, all in all that was good too."}
{"text":"Always great food, service and ambiance.  My fav dishes are the sizzling salmon or the sizzling chicken.  You have the option of adding on soup or fried rice for about $2 extra.  We have been dining here since they opened.  They recently built an outside seating area, so I am looking forward to sitting out there when it gets cooler."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place because we had won a gift card at our daughter's school's silent auction. We arranged for childcare and went out to the casino on a Sunday night. The ambiance is seriously lacking due to \"windows\" that open up into the casino allowing sound and smoke to invade like a flock of rabid pigeons at a garden party. We were seated at a tiny table in a corner in front of the aforementioned windows. This definitely was not adding to the desired \"date\" feel.   The menu was that of a posery \"Bamboo Club\" but lacked much of the club's appeal (and that's not saying much). We are very familiar with Asian food as my husband is Chinese and I was raised in a Chowhouse. The food was definitely not what one would could authentic, but more of a merely adequate take on fusion. We started with the Ahi appetizer. I believe we enjoyed the slaw it was served on more than the fish itself, as it was none too impressive. We decided to share an entree because we wanted to do three courses. For this we chose the seafood hot pot. I thought the sauce was good, but did not warrant the green curry label. I also thought salmon was a strange choice for the fish chunks in the dish. A white fish would have taken on the curry flavor much better. Salmon isn't something I really expect in cooked Asian dishes. When we ordered this dish, the waitress recommended that we not get the fried rice because the dish was \"more like a stew\". We hadn't even discussed fried rice because we knew what what we were ordering. Maybe this is a suggestion that should be reserved for people who ask for fried rice to avoid sounding condescending.   The desserts were decidedly not Asian, despite making a dessert spring roll. We tried the creme brulee because I'm a sucker for it. A little bit grainy IMO but it had a good flavor.   When it came time to settle the bill, all love was lost. They do not take Ling and Louie's gift cards! This was the sole reason we tried this place. The manager was sent over and dealt with us in a very patronizing (emphasis on very) tone about how he just couldn't do anything about it. When the waitress (Brittani?) returned she inquired what he had done to help and we told her nothing ,and that we were pretty angry. She then left for awhile and came back, telling us that she had asked him (the manager) to take off the entree and my hot tea. He did this, but only after she told him that we had considered leaving our gift card and splitting. Seriously, I have never considered a dine and dash until this jerk spoke to me like I was a four year old who had eaten too many cookies. Thanks Brittani, you're doing what it takes to make customers happy. Your manager, however, will rip the proverbial mask from the lackluster ambiance and flavors and expose this place for what it really is, a casino food stand. Think I'll go to Panda Express next time."}
{"text":"Classic case of a good thing going south... or something like that. Always great food, but time and again they just can't get the execution down. Service just slips more and more seemingly every visit. Gotta get that right."}
{"text":"I was trying to wait till I tried this place again, but decided eh, why not just write it now. The restaurant is located inside the Wild Horse Pass. The food is delicious too bad the service SUCKS big time! We had a plethora of appetizers and not one of them let me down. Our party was big so the service sucked at the worst time. They took our orders in order, then when serving the entire meal; each dish was yelled out by the servers deli style and then handed to our guests to place on the table themselves (if we wanted to serve ourselves we would have done a buffet). They did it very rude too. My plate was supposed to be served sizzling, but somehow the waiter forgot to serve it, as it sat on the table next to us for 5 minutes, then served lukewarm. On our way out (to dance) I witnessed the bartender reach into the ice bin with the actual glass she was serving the drink in (isn't this a violation?). I wonder if the service sucks because the menu is so affordable and delicious they are counting on return business? non the less I won't be back."}
{"text":"There are weekly specials so check with your server.  On the night we went it was 1/2 off a bottle of wine. We have been going here for years while visiting the Mayo Clinic.  Food is good and the services is friendly.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Yum!  I loved the chicken and rice soup and the mongolian beef (with filet) that I ordered.  The service was great, the atmosphere was nice and the food was especially good!"}
{"text":"My husband, son, daughter and I went for a Sunday lunch. My little girl who is only 2 did not want to sit still and cried so we left so other people could actually enjoy their lunch. Husband went back to pick up our lunch so we could enjoy it at home. We were very pleased. We will be back."}
{"text":"My coworker and I ordered a take-out @ 12noon, was told it'd be ready by 12:20pm, got there at 12:08, paid the bill and the food was ready!  Impressive, right?  Got back to the office, opened the Lettuce wraps that we ordered and disappointment rushes in.  We had two orders but we have ordered the same Lettuce wraps in the past and the container was fuller and the lettuce larger.  The container was less than half full, with a tablespoon of noodles!  What the heck?????  It was as good and tasty as it was in the past but the portion was very disappointing..."}
{"text":"I decided to try a place I hadn't before with the new Ubereats app so I chose this. I'm so happy I did. I went with the ahi poke tacos and the crab wontons. I only eat seafood so I'm slightly particular about it. The tacos were hands down some of the best I've had. Bigger than street size and you get 3. Amazeballs! The crab wontons also had a rich filling better than most. I wish they had dessert options for delivery but that's a minor detail. Highly suggest!!!"}
{"text":"Food is always great, as is the staff and management. We eat there very often. The menu changes occasionally , but they are always happy to make anything for you that was taken off or no longer offered. We take many people there for their first time and they always go back repeatedly"}
{"text":"Came for lunch, had spicy chicken (Like pf changs but not battered) and some basil spicy noodle dish with filet.  Filet was terrific and enjoyed the whole noodle dish.  Chicken dish was too sweet for my taste.  Also, the food was served on top of the rice... lots of sauce...  soaked up all into the rice.  Some like this, I do not.  I like my rice on the side.  Also, chicken didn't look cooked all the way... server took it back right away to get us a new one.  Service was great but food was just okay for me. I would opt to go to George & Sons at FLW and Via Linda if you want Asian food."}
{"text":"Yummers! Not a five star review just because something so juicy should never be put on an almost flat plate. Not true to the picture I got more rice than soup, but if you are in the mood for something exquisite and you like seafood... This is it!"}
{"text":"I love the American Asian fusion of the choices here. Adds a nice twist to familiar flavors"}
{"text":"I thought I was going to have a \"normal\" Asian lunch.  I was pleasantly surprised by what I experienced.  Based on my buddies suggestion, we started with a Mongolian Beef flatbread.  For our main course we each had the F'n Sliders.  The food was so flavorful and delicious!  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"After an upsetting first experience, we were welcomed back by the manager to give it another shot. I was very impressed how quickly they contacted me back to make things right  We went during happy hour and both the food and service were outstanding. We had a variety of appetizers off the happy hour menu. I think the potstickers and flatbread win personally, but everything was great  We will definitely be back and am happy we gave it another chance"}
{"text":"Amazing - chicken wonton nachos , tom kha and firecracker chicken.. Top notch Service was great and the food was fast. Must try copper ale - in house microbrew"}
{"text":"You know, I had dinner here  the other night for the first time and the food was good, just above ok but no where near great.  Our server was nice but didn't know the beer menu at all.  Also, It took forever for our main course to arrive. Overall it was meh."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Happy Hour. Food is great! Speciality drinks are great! I recently had the meatloaf. I know...why try the meatloaf?? Because it's under their specialties and every time I go I see the meatloaf but thought the same thing, Meatloaf?? I can make my own meatloaf at home...But this has an Asian gravy with wasabi mashed potatoes and Szechuan green beans WOW. Its not mom's meatloaf or mine, lol. I finally broke down and ordered it. Btw make sure you are hungry it's a nice size plate. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Sorry. Disappointed I'm used to the great service and food at whp casino. This place is shabby looking no flavor to the food and the old guy behind the bar is goofy"}
{"text":"Great food Asian concept with American feel Plates are generous Wish it would be more spicer  Awesome drinks Awesome happy hour special   Great service"}
{"text":"Disappointed with this place. Went there for lunch, ordered from  \"Louies favorites\"  the blackened chix & pork. Tasted like fried pork & chix No flavor or spices and definitely the chef forgot the spicy garlic ginger soy sauce. The waiter brought our plates of food & his THUMB was in my bowl of rice. REALLY!!! Yuck!! Mediocre food. Should have received 1/2 star. And their menu says \"not for boring people\", your food is boring."}
{"text":"First day in Arizona.. 1 hr after checking in our hotel at Wild Horse Pass hotel and casino.. we decided to try out this asian spot. it was pretty good.. but not as good as the asian spots in Cali where most asians lived. the food was a bit too salty. the lemonade drink thing i got was too bitter. wished it was a bit sweeter. my bestie and i ordered the Pad Thai and Filet mignon dish.. both were a bit salty. the Pad thai was drowning in msg and sauce. it was a bit too much for me =/  Service was great tho!!! the asian man who was our waiter was very attentive and hooked us up.   next time i wanna try their Sliders. the burgers looked HUGE O_O"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. It is always good food and the price is just right.   We love the pad thai. So flavorsome. The meatloaf is great. It has such a great meaty flavor with that sweet vinegary glaze.  For lighter fare try the chopped chicken salad.   The drinks are very inventive."}
{"text":"Not often I hit the 5 star button. This place has every box of mine checked. The burger is just crazy good, avocado and Asian influences and just awesome. The salad with the Ahi seared tuna, a must have. I have also tried many items on the Asian menu all really good. What makes me give this all the stars is that the offer inside/outside dining, have great beer selections as well as full bar with some daily kool cocktails plus, food selections from American and Asian and some fused in between, a great bar staff and the prices for the greater Scottsdale area well in line."}
{"text":"This is an average food spot with really good service. I'm not really big on all the wok stuff, so I had to find some alternatives...and, there really aren't many. We had a good time and our service was funny. I'd go back."}
{"text":"I would have given this spot a fourth star but because it's inside of a casino with an open panel front where the smoke and noise finds its way in- I couldn't. Other than that, the service was excellent, the staff was friendly and the food was great. I had the hot pot which was filled with; scallops, sausage and salmon...in a green coconut ginger curry. It was most excellent! I'd get it again...  My guests had the poki and ahi salad, from the looks of it and tastes- it was great.   Not a bad place, but I think the only way I'd be back is, if we stayed here again."}
{"text":"We went for lunch today, we love this place! From the giant swivel barn door at the entrance to the hilarious signs and interesting decor inside. Comfortable seating. The wait staff and bartenders seem to work as a team, we didn't feel rushed, and all staff very friendly. The potstickers are the best we've had in AZ, sure made us homesick for Hawaii. Entrees were Evil Jungle Princess and Firecracker Chicken Tacos, both done perfectly, spicy but not killer spicy, and very flavorful. The bleu cheese crumbles on the tacos - an interesting unexpected fusion of flavors. Even the restroom was decorated nicely and very clean. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I dined at Ling & Louie's on a Friday night. The place was mobbed and I had to wait 1/2 hour for a deuce to open up. They seat people that call in and say they'll be right over first before they seat live body walk-ins. Now that I know the lay of the land I'll be prepared for next time.  There will be a next time because the food and the service rocks. It's hard to believe this restaurant is at 3 1/2 stars on Yelp given all the people who showed up this past Friday. My wife and I started off with the rice and chicken soup. What surprised me was that there was hardly any rice in the soup but plenty of chicken. The soup was too peppery plus there was another spice in there that I couldn't put my finger on. So the soup was a solid 2.5 to 3 stars.   Now for the main course, I ordered the Kung Pow Beef and my wife had the Thai Pad. The Kung Pow Beef consisted of filet minon, broccoli, green onions, bell peppers and hot peppers over rice. I definitely enjoyed this dish. My plate was piled high with delicious food and had a flavorable spicy kick to it. I would definitely order this dish on subsequent visits. My wife enjoyed the Thai Pad and was definitely happy that she had plenty of leftovers for subsequent lunches. Again, very generous portions for this entree.  I can't wait to try out the rest of the menu, this place definitely is head and shoulders above it's competitors such as Flo's and PF Chang because the food definitely tastes better."}
{"text":"I love Ling & Louie's.  Their food is SO good.  Hubby and I eat here A LOT.  I've tried a few different things but always come back to the Sizzling Chicken & Shrimp skillet.  Oh so tasty.  The fried rice is REALLY tasty, but I've been trying to eat healthier and have been getting the brown rice which is always fluffy and good.  We've always eaten at the bar and have had great service.  The only reason I knocked it down a star is because it's a little pricey.  But still worth it..."}
{"text":"I met a few friends for lunch here during the week and it was pretty busy.  They had a decent lunch drink special which is always a plus!  We shared the mongolian beef flat bread.  It was delicious.  I was tempted to order another one to take home but didn't.  You can order a lunch special during the week for $7.95.  My friend and I shared the Kung POW Beef.  It was just enough for the two of us, but probably because we are busy talking to each other instead of eating.  The service was ok...we waited a really long time to get our tab.  Otherwise, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"It's not \"Asian\" food at all, it's (someone's) \"Asian food concept\". I thought everything was either bland, or hot for the sake of being hot - no complexity in the flavors.  Most ESPECIALLY if you're from the Northeast or California,  I think you will be sorely disappointed.  (Now I must tell you here that I am a \"traditionalist\" - being from NYC & Boston, and having family in San Francisco, that is the yardstick I go by.)  Also, their menu is written slightly cutesy - which I usually find annoying, and even MORE so in a Chinese restaurant.   \"Chop-Chop Lunch Specials\"?   It's definitely a chain-style restaurant - and we already have PF Chang's up the wazoo here in the Valley. I didn't have any problems with the service, but I've only been there on weeknights.  Twice. Won't bother again."}
{"text":"They keep amazing me! Every time!!!!! The consistency is there! I can't imagine not eating at this restaurant less than 3 times a month!"}
{"text":"We have tried Ling & Louie's several times for lunch in the last few months and have enjoyed each meal!   Décor/ambience. Clean, tasteful modern décor. Yes the restaurant is in a casino, but we have not noticed much of a smoke-smell or intrusive noise.  Service. Has been excellent on each trip! No complaints here at all.  Food. We have mainly been trying the skillet dishes as they've been running $4.00-off  specials (regularly $14-17) with our favorite being the Surf & Turf (hard to go wrong with filet mignon, shrimps, asparagus, onions, and mushrooms!) Uncle Fu's Fried Rice is $1.99 extra, but is VERY GOOD! That being said the brown rice is also good. There are 8-10 lunch specials ($9.00 each). You don't get soup or eggroll or anything with it - but you don't need it as the portions are ample (especially the sizzling platters - we recommend sharing one). Their signature meatloaf is accompanied by Wasabi Mashed Potatoes and Szechuan Green Beans is all very good, but the meatloaf seems more like home-cooked and not what you think of for a Chinese meal. The Firecracker Chicken with Broccoli and Chicken Lo Mein were just average with both needing more sauce and oomph!  We are looking forward to our next trip!!"}
{"text":"Super cool vibe! Love sitting outside in the booth and watching the TV! Really great place for a date night! Also, they have really great specialty drinks and great service. The food is amazing as well. I recommend the General Ling's chicken!"}
{"text":"A great classic local place with top service and consistently great food ... If they offered Beefeaters it would be perfect, but five stars non-the less..."}
{"text":"Here lies the remains of my Ling & Louie's review, may it rest in peace. A once colorful and insightful diatribe, (at least in my opinion) is now rotting somewhere in the depths of a dark and dingy Yelp dungeon. (see below) I'll give it another try. Here goes.  Ling and Louie's is a nice retreat from all the madness one might expect from an Indian Casino and its trailer-trash, octogenarian patrons.  Their Evil Jungle Princess is 8.95 and average, nothing to get excited about.  I took sanctuary in Ling & Louie's after I caught drift of what the Summer's Eve challenged old lady on the slot machine next to mine was cooking, my nose hairs singed beyond recognition.  As I said, safe haven for under ten bucks is a deal, even if the food is average.

Our Support team has determined that it falls outside our Content Guidelines (http://www.yelp.com/guidelines) because it contains inappropriate content."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place got such mixed reviews.  I went and all the food we ate was dee-lish.  We took the advice of our wonderful server, Jill (definitely ask for her - she's great!).  She recommended Fire Rock Pale Ale, the Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll, Jewelled Beef Noodles and the Surf and Turf with Vegetable Fried Rice.  Everything was perfectly spiced and sauced; the beef was very tender and veggies were fresh.  It can be a little pricey, but check out their daily specials.  I'll definitely pop in here again!"}
{"text":"Fits the bill for a quality lunch.  Plentiful options, fairly priced lunch specials, prompt service, and a comfortable atmosphere.  Their take on Pad Thai is  unique, light, and flavorful."}
{"text":"I'm not grading this on authenticity... just on taste and value.  As Scottsdale das developed and evolved the hipper cooler places have moved north.  After several places closed between 2008 and 2010, good food was getting harder and harder to find in 85259.   L&Ls has great tasting food, love the Mongolian beef flat-bread and the Honey Walnut Chicken.   The service is excellent and location is great.  Adequate parking and not far from 101 but not buried around 90th and 92nd St.  And Carol, the meatloaf is probably only on the menu for kids (or adults) who choose something safe sounding... don't think its fair to grade them on meatloaf...  I don't critic meatloaf (even when it just 3 stars) on a Asian/fusion/whatever-it-is menu!

{"text":"Stopped in after trip to mall.   Very prompt service although I am not a fan of the handheld ordering devices as it seems to prevent servers from making eye contact.  And as someone who waits on bar patrons, I prefer that they do not write down or enter the order while at the table.    But Jamie was very friendly and efficient and the potstickers and crab puffs were unbelievable.  The sauce served with the potstickers was absolutely delicious.   Just the perfect amount of heat.  Definitely recommend.  We have come in for happy hour several Times and it is a really good happy hour menu.   I am updating my review in January 2017 they have eliminated the I pad order takers so the personal service is back. However it was so cold in there on a rainy Friday afternoon.  I asked three different employees to turn the heat on and close the door to the patio but they would not make the smallest effort. Unfortunately as good as the food was the experience was awful. It was not just me and my daughter. Several other tables commented on the cold.  I felt really ignored over the fact that they would not close the door at the very least.  We probably will not go back and this was o e of our favorite places.  I am Once again updating my review of January 2017. I was very frustrated with the response from the staff when the temperature of the restaurant belied any attempt at comfort. I was immediatly contacted by John. With a follow up from Brandon the store manager. They assured me that they had already taken steps to change procedures to put The comfort of their guests first.  The quick response of both John and Brandon have completely changed my feelings of Not wanting to return.  The food has always been amazing and I am confident that my January visit was an outlier and should not count toward my review of Ling and Louie's.   Thanks John and Brandon."}
{"text":"Love this place. The Mongolian beef appetizer is the best ever. Everything I've had there so far is awesome."}
{"text":"The prices here are extremely high for the quantity of food you received. The wait time here was in sane for lunch time, which includes being greeted, getting our drinks, ordering the food, getting the food, but when it came time to pay for the food the waiter was miraculously around. We ordered lettuce wraps and was told it is their biggest appetizer, there were only 5 SMALL lettuce wraps. We order the General Louies Chicken and Mongolian Chicken. The food was good, but the portions were extremely small. I am not sure if I would come here again, for paying a good amount of money, I expected left overs for dinner."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  My husband and I stopped in for lunch after the Farmers Market in the same strip mall.  I liked the warm feel of the place, and that the menu has some options that only have an Asian twist.  My F'n Loaded sliders (3) with filet mignon, bleu cheese, and bacon came with a garlic-ginger soy sauce.  At roughly $12, they were a little pricey, but the filet was very tender and I had a snack for later.  The garlic-parmesan fries were ridiculously addicting, and I found myself continuing to eat them past the point of no return...meaning, I just ate them until they were gone.  Then I was offered more, and had to make the difficult decision to decline.  Definitely worth a try if you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. The food was interesting and NOT in a good way. Dined here with Family after the show at Wild Horses Casino. It's apparently Asian food, supposedly. Yet from what region? Who knows? The rice is definitely not your typical jasmine rice, Asian rice that is fluffy and soft and can take on any flavors of your meal. Their rice is solid, harder and super uniformed.   PASS on the following: Honey Walnut Shrimp - it didn't look like anything I have ever had. It had mushrooms in it and had an odd cream brownish sauce that was super tart/tangy. Strange appeal and so was the flavor.  Seared Ahi Tuna-obviously was thawed out and lightly seared and prepared who knows how long before it was served to us. It was dry and appeared to have been sitting out for hours.  I also ordered coffee to help me keep up. Yet, once requesting a refill I was told by the waitress, \"you don't want to order it, it's not fresh and who knows how long it's been sitting out and we are closing soon.\"  ????? WOW.  Simply put, THIS is NOT Asian food period."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Houston the server/bartender was nice, and made amazing drinks.  Happy hour is GREAT, especially since all of the food and cocktails are fantastic, it's an extra bonus to get them for just $5.  I had the Thai Mai (AMAZING and seriously a steal for $5 on HH), the Ginger Margarita, crab wontons, crunchy crab roll and Beef fried rice. No joke, all were 10/10. My only criticism would be more meat in the fried rice entree -- there were only about 8 pieces of the beef, but of course it was delicious.  I'm sad this place is so far out on the north east valley, but if you ever find yourself in the area, make sure to stop in.   The selection of food is awesome as well -- I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"So we have eaten here several times and each time the food and service has been very good. We usually sit at the bar for drinks and food. I love sushi but do yourself a favor and skip it here, very disappointing. The sizzling platter surf and turf is addicting. Sliced fillet Mignon, shrimp, veggies, I crave it! The mister got the Jeweled Beef on the last visit. Fillet Mignon, Asian noodles and veggies wok fried in a chili sauce. Our server warned him on the heat level but he ordered it anyway. If you like spicy food this one if for you. I had one bite and it was way too hot for me but I am a bit of a wimp when it comes to spicy foods....damn you acid reflux!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on my way to Sprouts.  Tyler greeted me with a business card (RicE to MeeT YoU), directed me to a seat, explained the specials and took my drink order.  Nice service.  Despite hearing the specials including a noodle dish with tender duck I came to try the Korean Sizzling Salmon as shown in a newspaper ad.  The Atlantic Salmon smothered in hot sesame ginger over a bed of asparagus was really sizzling.  Tyler put it on the opposite side of the table and warned how sizzling it was.  Yes, indeed it was sizzling and the salmon stayed very hot for the duration (even the broccoli).  The sauce masked the underlying farm raised salmon but was tasty.  Not my favorite preparation technique but an acceptable alternative.  While shopping at Sprouts I noticed some sauce on my arm so beware of the sizzle if you give it a try."}
{"text":"We have ordered twice from Lin & Louie's using UberEats and the first time wasn't so bad but we ordered again last night and only basing this off of the food and it was awful! We ordered the lettuce wraps, chicken fried rice and tom kha gai soup. I started my meal with the lettuce wraps and the piece of lettuce was sooooo small it only held one spoonful of mixture. I moved onto my soup and talk about mushroom overload! Once I got to a bit of chicken something tasted off. The entire time I was eating it the chicken tasted funny but thought it might be because it was in the soup broth. My boyfriend had the lettuce wraps and the fried rice. He also only had one lettuce wrap as it was so small and super salty. His fried rice was also super salty and he couldn't even finish it. Skip to a few hours later and my stomach was making all kinds of sounds....well, guess what...I got sick! My stomach has been messed up for 12 hours now and I know it was from the chicken in the soup. This was extremely disappointing and we will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"We used to go there all the time for the great food. Hadn't gone in a while so I decided to take my wife on a casino date. Found the menu had changed. Ordered egg rolls or spring rolls for an appetizer. They no longer had either. What Chinese restaurant doesn't have egg rolls or spring rolls?!?!  Dinner was just ok. I ordered a dish with two indicators of spicy. I guess salt is a spice as mine was way over salted and I like a lot of salt!  I hope we just hit them on a bad day because we used to love this place and just for that will we try them one more time."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and crowd here. This is an Asian / Mexican fusion place.  Good place for a fun girls night out  or a HH with friends . Tons of cocktails to choose from, i like  the jasmine star  it is a nice sipping cocktail. Service is super friendly and  has always been on pointe.  Highlights after multiple visits- the chicken lettuce wraps. beef with asparagus dish(pepper seared beef)  really delicious. The Miso soup isn't bad ( i have had better). My son loves the firecracker chicken with broccoli .  Prices are decent  we always enjoy our time here."}
{"text":"This place is always great for HH 3-6. They have good drink specials & food deals. They revamped their outside patio & its a lot nicer. We normally sit at the outside bar & our drinks are never empty. Love the Mongolian flatbread & lettuce wraps! The original mule is mainly what I drink. Nice casual atmosphere & chill vibe. If you want loud.....go next door to Salt & Lime."}
{"text":"Can't beat the happy hour specials. I've tried most of them and they are all fabulous."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was exceptional. I almost always go with the Jeweled Beef and ask them to make it a bit spicier. The bartender (Mike) was friendly and very attentive. My only \"complaint\" is the portion size for the price. I'm typically still hungry after dinner unless I get an appetizer as well."}
{"text":"Had a lovely, long date night dinner here last night on the AZ Restaurant Week fixed menu. While the ambiance isn't really all that romantic, we were able to wind our way slowly through drinks and dinner. Lettuce wrap apps were tasty, the Surf and Turf (Beef and Shrimp stir fry basically) was flavorful and the chocolate volcano cake was delicious. Paired it with a nice bottle of WA Cabernet...I'm not dying to get back, but it's not a bad place to go for sure."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about Ling & Louie's, but between the high prices and the mediocre food, I've simply had much better Asian cuisine elsewhere.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  I will say that both the service and atmosphere at Ling & Louie's was great, with abundant seating and really strong servers who handled our table of six without issue. Star.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  The prices at Ling & Louie's are high, and I was pretty shocked to find that my 'New Wave Pad Thai' came to a whopping $14.25. That would be expensive back in Los Angeles, and it's certainly expensive in Scottsdale. No Star.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  This New Wave Pad Thai, which I couldn't entirely differentiate from most standard Pad Thai, was fine, but none of the flavors blew me away. You had all the essentials, but it really just tasted like a sum of its parts. Single Star.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Ling & Louie's is fine, but I wouldn't come expecting to be blown away; and there are better Asian options in the area. No Star."}
{"text":"Nice Variety of items on their menu.  Love me some good soup! The Tom Kha Gai soup is delicious and filling."}
{"text":"Ventured in late afternoon, just missing happy hour (11-3). Sat at bar and Ryan was just coming on. This was the second time we sat at bar with Ryan.  We got a few cocktails instead of beer, I got the Geishas Gimlet, substitute gin for vodka because wifey does not approve my behavior on gin... lol. The Gimlet was very good. We ordered crab puffs, lettuce wraps and general li, wit chicken. Chicken lightly fried and breaded. Very good. The crab puffs were exceptional!! Overall very good atmosphere and experience."}
{"text":"Been here many times in the past. Usually good all around. Came in today for lunch with my kids. Only a few tables occupied and a few people at bar. Bartender ended up being our server and she was fine. Decided to order drunken pretzel app. Thought my kids would like it. After ordering it and lunch, was told they will cook it fresh so the app will take like 10 minutes. No problem.   Well, 10 minutes turned into 30. Server apologized but said they are coming out of the oven in 45 seconds. Ok we've waited this long. 5 minutes later still no food. Now we're at almost 40 minutes and I was hangry!!!  Walked up to server at food service area. No food for me so I told her we were leaving. Pissed me off. No manager or anyone did or said anything. Nice."}
{"text":"First time here and will be the last!  Food just had no taste. Portions were big but I would rather go somewhere else.  Ordered the cashew chicken and pork dumplings."}
{"text":"Cowafee Tawk -- Restaurants in Casinos - Yes? -- No?  Unless, you're in Vegas, you shouldn't expect much from restaurants in Casinos around the valley.  They are what they are and L & L is fake Chinese food.  Surprised!?  Well let's just say the food is okay compared to my cooking (I don't cook).  They're tad bit better I guess I can say.  I got some sliders \"Asian Fusion?\"  and it was edible -- I like my fries :)  The service is actually very good.  My water glass was always full -- almost too full at times.  Thankfully I didn't spill.  The ambience of the place is tad bit rowdy and too bright for my taste.  I'd appreciate less lighting, and it's not to say I like to eat in the dark :)  - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I drove by here so many times and always wondered what it was like.. Finally I decided to stop by for a quick dinner the other day.  I started my dinner with frozen Thai Mai.  When the server said something about pineapple, it sounded sweet and good.  It sure was yummy. I think I like drinks with pineapple.  For my dinner, I ordered honey walnut crispy shrimp with brown rice (dinner choice is jasmine or brown rice).  She mentioned with extra dollars, they can substitute to fried rice.  They put main dish over rice when they serve (it doesn't come separately), I thought fried rice will change the main dish taste.  Friendly service with nice smiles. I can't explain it but I just felt pleasantly comfortable dining there.   When it came time to pay, the server swiped a card by my table. I just thought it was comforting (although I wasn't doubting anything) that she didn't have to walk away with customers' credit card.  It was weekday dinner but they were busy, so I sat at the outside patio (with heater of course...)  As I walked back inside to leave, I saw the sign Toledo 1,900 miles...(can't remember the exact numbers).  It just made me smile. I didn't know but Louie is from Toledo. I think I will be coming here more frequently."}
{"text":"This place was nice.  maybe a little pricey but we all had a good time. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Food wasn't.  Except the chicken letters wrap that was fine Ant the banana desert taste unique"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to dinner here over the weekend. We've only gone to the new Gila River Casino once since they did the overhaul and the first time we visited we just ate in the food court area.     We got there around the dinner rush so it wasn't surprising when we were handed a little pager for when our table was ready. We took the pager and went to walk the casino while we waited. They said our wait would be 20 to 30 minutes but the pager went off at around 15 minutes.   We were there on a Saturday night and they seemed to be rather well staffed. Our waitress was nice, friendly and helpful when it came down to questions about the menu and the alcohol selections. My husband ordered the Lo-Mein which he liked once he dug under and got to the noodles that were under all the carrots. I got the surf and turf. The steak was cooked to perfection along with the shrimp and the green beans were steamed perfectly.    All in all my husband and I enjoyed our experience at the restaurant. Next time, we'd like to get there at a time where we could actually be seated on the patio so that we can enjoy our food outside."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4.5 star. Today we went there, met Uncle Fu aka Paul (patron saint of their fried rice and an all-around awesome kinda guy). Despite my friend nearly stomping on his foot with her stilettos while he was chatting up some other clients he is an amiable, witty character and actually remembered us from a previous visit) and ordered the ahi lettuce wraps for an appetizer. My mouth was sooooooooooo happy! What a delicious and wonderful change from the regular chicken lettuce wraps (although they offer those too, but I haven't tried them).   I ordered the strawberry limeade and the Evil Jungle Princess with jasmine rice and the flavors are such that you wish the meal could go on forever...even as your tummy is telling you that it's time to stop the madness.    This place has earned it's spot in our lunch rotation. Yummylicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service.  We had Firecracker chicken and Mongolian Chicken and both were spectacular."}
{"text":"The manager reached out to me & we tried again. It was an Uber Eats delivery & everything really was great.  I ordered potstickers , honey walnut chic & shrimp ( not over rice ) , pad thai , tuna tacos. Honestly , I did not expect it to be this good. Hubby was very happy after working so hard coming home to this !! So glad I tried it again :)"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for happy hour. They really have a great assortment of items on the happy hour menu.   I opted to get the california roll and the lettuce wraps. I've had much better california rolls and wouldn't really recommend it. The lettuce wraps were really good, though, and i had enough to take home leftovers. I had the pinot grigio wine and it was quite nice and sweet.   My friends also had sushi (vegetable roll and crab crunch roll) and potstickers. They both enjoyed their items.  the best part of it all were the prices. all 3 of us ate and drank for under $40 total. MY NY self was in shock at how cheap the bill was.   I would definitely come back and try other things"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for happy hour and sushi. Was surprised to see they took off sushi from the menu and the happy hour menu has changed significantly. Food still good but was extremely disappointed as we were both craving sushi."}
{"text":"Great food - two favorites by far are the Evil Jungle Princess (w/ fillet Mignon & noodles) and the sizzling blackened chicken and pork. The flavor is unreal - they know what they are doing. Everyone comments about how it's not \"real\" Chinese food but I am telling you - it's better. Don't waste your time or money at Flo's or Jade, I have eaten all three many times and Ling is hands down better tasting food."}
{"text":"7 of my friends in family are in town for my brother's wedding tomorrow so I decided to take them out to Ling and Louie's that I have been coming to for years. Never again. I made a reservation just before noon for 7pm. We get to the restaurant and they forgot to hold a table for us. They had me sit with my guests outside in the heat and made no effort to accommodate us. I asked to speak to the manager, Houston, THREE times and each time I was told he would come to our table. He never came. Houston was clearly avoiding the confrontation because he and his team were definitely in the wrong. It would have been courteous to at least come and apologize. We left drenched in sweat. To top it off my glass was grimy and they ran out of cups. Have you ever heard of a restaurant running out of cups? Houston feel free to call me if you want to chat. You guys took my number when I called and made my \"reservation\" at 11:57 am today."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood to this restaurant.  When it first opened several years ago we went once and found the food to be comme ci comme ça.  After a year we gave it a second try and are sure glad we did.  We not frequent the restaurant once a week and always get the orange chicken without the spinach, walnut honey chicken, or firecracker chicken.  If you are thinking take out the orange chicken does best as the honey and walnut lose their crispiness before you get out of the parking lot.  The service at the bar for takeout is great.  They make a point of remembering their customers and prepare food quickly.  I don't often dine in."}
{"text":"Go check this joint out!!! Paul and Houston behind the bar are great! The banana desert is to die for!! The long life soup is the best soup I have had in AZ!  Great lunch destination!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I called in a togo order at 645. We were told it would take about 10-15 minutes. We live about 20 away so I figured my food might be cold but at least ready when I got there.  The two girls in the bar were not friendly. No smiles, no \"ill be with you shortly\",  nothing! So after a few minutes one girl asked if I wanted to place an order and I told her I called one in. She said it wasnt ready it would be 10 more minutes (it took me about 35 minutes to drive there any park) even though I was quoted 10-15. 10 minutes go by....nothing. I ask again and the other bartender said that its still not ready. I ended up waiting 1 hour and 20 minutes from when I called it in to receive my order. I checked the ticket and the order ticket wasn't printed till an hour after I called it in. So clearly some one messed up and forgot to ring in my food and doesnt own up to it. Im giving three stars ONLY because the food was absolutely fabulous! ! Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection! ! We have eaten here before with great service but today was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and wide selection of beverages. The potstickers are hand made. The crab wontons are some of the  best I have ever had. Hand made with big chunks of what appears to be crap with a sweet citrus sauce. GreAt appetizer."}
{"text":"Very good food! We loved sitting on the patio, it was very dimly lit and relaxing. We enjoyed the potstickers and wine very much! The staff was really attentive as well. I would have liked to try everything on the menu!! Next time :) thank you for a nice evening!"}
{"text":"You know what sucks... this place is too far away from my house in Gilbert! We went here one night while at the hotel and wow was it tasty. I ordered the ahi tacos and I'm still dreaming about them. The sushi was tasty and the drinks were delicious. The fried rice was a bit odd and not really want you expect. However, I think I'll be back for the sushi and the Ahi taco's real soon!!!! Oh, the service was WAY quick and very friendly! We were told 30-40 mins, we went to play a game and we were buzzed over. Very impressed!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Asian restaurant. We had a gift card here that we just didn't use for over a year. Finally came in and the host / bartender was quick to accommodate our family of six. My kids and my wife loved all the food. Get the Evil Jungle Princess. phenomenal. Our server was awesome. Lady with full sleeve tattoo. Only thing odd was the music choice in the restaurant. Ranged from the Doors to Black Sabbath, U2, and AC/DC.  Anyways. Definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"The food was good but having to walk thru a smoke filled casino was really bad. It looked like you could access the restaurant without having to go thru the casino, but you can't.  The calamari appetizer was good. My wife is gluten free and they have a pretty good sized gf menu.  The service was good, not excellent.   I will try another, but will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"Had the General Lings for lunch...fantastic. food came up quick and was delicious.  Service was good and the price is right."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was the smoke from the casino that dried out my eyes or the overly sweet and saucy entree. The draft beer wasnt fresh but the decor was nice and the service was good. I wouldn't recommend this place mainly from the smoky environment."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time when they opened their location in the new Wild Horse Pass Casino. This location is kind of hidden on Shea but definitely worth stopping in. I love that they serve their Orange Chicken with crispy spinach. Not quite as good as the Bamboo Club but that is hard to beat in my mind. The food was very tasty and if you sign up for their text club when you sit down you will get a free order of edamame. Also, they have lunch specials for around $7 so that might be a great time to stop in."}
{"text":"I must admit that Ling and Louie's was a good dining surprise. We came starving and ready to eat not expecting much - expecting something like a Pei Wei. We walked in and the restaurant was pretty busy on a Monday night. There was a cute bar on the left and a hostess to seat us. It was loud, really loud but such a cool modern Asian American restaurant. The menu was extensive so we needed some time to review.   We finally decided on sharing the Asian seafood hot pot with fried rice and miso soup. Our server was awesome! He was so friendly and because we decided to share, he made sure the kitchen split the dishes for us. The miso soup I wasn't a big fan of but the hot pot made up for it. The flavors of the hot pot was superb with the coconut broth, fried rice, mussels, salmon, shrimp and scallops. Oh my it was so good!!   The portions were generous because I couldn't finish my half of the entree. Kind of like a frequent flyer program, they have a dining loyalty program where you earn a free meal after ten visits. They also offer happy hour M-F from 3-7p, Sat 11a-3p, and 9p-close.   If I'm in the area again, I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Walking by the restaurant, we peeked at the menu and the unique items on there caught our interest, so we popped in for a bite.  There's a lot of interesting combinations of Asian, Mexican, American, Italian style food on the menu.  After a few minutes, we decided to order:  Edamame, $4.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg?select=dQv6EXMRrGXzekKHPrWCBQ#dQv6EXMRrGXzekKHPrWCBQ Potstickers, $7.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg?select=IujYeFio8lXyFxtXlS7aZQ#IujYeFio8lXyFxtXlS7aZQ Firecracker Chicken with Broccoli, $11.99  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg?select=TNdXgXqP1vHHewqCcS5CDQ#TNdXgXqP1vHHewqCcS5CDQ Meatloaf Sliders, $11.99 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg?select=Nnk3lac4Z-WL2PadKfHXlQ#Nnk3lac4Z-WL2PadKfHXlQ Garlic Parmesan Fries (Came with the Sliders) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tAEKCC7h9h9A79SfYx0Prg?select=5L5xBaNpKxIVuF7iv3g4rw#5L5xBaNpKxIVuF7iv3g4rw  The food came out pretty fast.  The Edamame was very good, The Potstickers were delish.  The Meatloaf Sliders was the one that I was most interested in, but it came up short.  The Meatloaf was a little bland, lacked a full flavor that I was expecting.  The Garlic Parmesan Fries were very good and full of flavor.  The best item though was the Firecracker Chicken w/Broccoli....nice Spicy flavor and the Sauce that the Chicken was cooked in complimented the dish well.  Overall, it was a decent experience.  There are many more items on the menu I'd like to try.  Return Factor - 87%"}
{"text":"Worst service ever - we waited 20 minutes (waiving madly) before someone came to take our drink order - so we gave him our full order.  Then we waited another 25 minutes for dumplings that were tasty but not particularly warm.  30 minutes later our food came - well, 2 of 3 - another 5 minutes for the third dish.  The restaurant was not full - not even close - so it was not that they were busy.  This is just a very, very slow kitchen.  By the way, the food was OK but not good.   We have been to Ling & Louie's before but it will be a long time before we go again - life is too short! By the way, I can't check good for kids below because you would have to have kids with amazing patience to avoid a melt-down."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the food. Ordered crab wontons as an appetizer, which were delicious. For an entree, I had the general Lings with fried rice. One word, delicious! You won't be disappointed when you make your way over here ."}
{"text":"For my birthday dinner I enjoyed my \"usual\" dish... the Sizzling Surf and Turf... shrimp and filet mignon... can't go wrong! Get it with the wasabi mashed potato upgrade. Worth it!   My wife really enjoyed her Evil Jungle Princess Chicken... I couldn't keep my fork from snatching bites while trying to distract her.  We also KILLED the Chocolate Volcano for dessert... which they bought to the table for my birthday. It was incredible!  As always... a good meal at a good place.  My wife really enjoyed her"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Monday night at 6:45. Ask to sit outside and got seated. Had menus given to us. Sat there for over 10 minutes and no drink orders, water, not a thing was said to us. Waited 5 more minutes then got up and walked out. A server stopped us and said are you leaving? I said yeah I waited 15 minutes and did not even get a glass of water? Lots of restaurants on Shea want my dime so I'm out. Another server apologized but there were just 5 tables on the patio.. They were not busy.. I've had drinks there at the Bar and the bartenders were great but I guess sitting away from the bar is a bad idea. Anyway went to Jade Palace and had amazing moo go gai pan. Update: 2/21/18 as you see the customer service manager contacted me, I gave him my number and he said they would be in touch. Still yet to hear from them about my experience."}
{"text":"Came in here because the service and wait at salt and lime next door were complete shit. So glad we did it was way better than we expected. Everything was so fresh, way generous portions and service was unstoppable. I couldn't believe the kids meal. I liked it almost more than my own meal. They also have sushi burritos here!!!!! Lots of options for the non fish or Asian food lover. Steak, chicken, pork, bowls, salads, ETc. pay to upgrade to fried rice!!!! You won't regret it"}
{"text":"Wow! I ate here today and I have to say... I eat here about every week. Usually I frequent here with senator McCain. We have a quiet booth in the corner and drink our house made limeaide discussing upcoming ballots. This place is a landmark. The jeweled beef is a Scottsdale commodity along with the firecracker chicken. We get the best service I've ever received. I couldn't imagine not being able to have this hideaway. The history here almost makes it a historic landmark. South beach failed, black and bleu was a let down, and seasons should've known that in AZ we only have one, HOT, and if you can't be hot don't come I. Here!"}
{"text":"LING & Louise  is inside Wild Horse Pass Casino. The service started out a bit slow, our waitress took our order than 2 more tables order so and this was after it took about 10 min to get water and limeade and it wasn't crowded at all when we arrived but once the appetizer came out the entree came about 5 min later. The food was plentiful, couldn't eat it all but was very tasty.  I gave it a 3 star for the slow start."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite restaurant in all America. I'm not even kidding. The service is always wonderful and the food is just amazing. So many options! You can substitute tofu in any dish and that's a dream for any vegetarian! They have seasonal menus so there's always something new to try. The drink menu is amazing as well. Definitely a must try. Especially if you are staying on property at the Sheraton (which is also my favorite hotel in all the land ) ENJOY!"}
{"text":"All the food was excellent, especially the sliders. Our waitress was excellent. We have been here many times and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"We were there on Thursday night. The special was a shrimp and chicken dish. It was EXCELLENT! Please add to your menu. Houston and Ryan are great, and very accommodating."}
{"text":"The Emerald Spinach salad is THE best salad I have ever had. And the staff is very helpful and friendly.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my 7 year-old daughter. It was a mixed experience. We walk in and there is a sign instructing patrons to wait to be seated. So we wait. And we wait. Strike 1.   No host or hostess ever shows up, so eventually the bartender points to a booth and we go sit down. And we wait. And wait some more. Strike 2.   So now we have been in the place about 10 minutes and still no server, no drinks, no menus. I start to explain to my daughter why I think we should just get up and leave, and just then a waitress finally shows up. She is pleasant and she brings us menus and drinks. But I notice that the people next to us, who have a different server, are given a menu containing specials. So I ask our server to see the specials since she did not bring those to us. Strike 3.  The menu is amazing. We order, and the food is delivered super quickly. And it is delicious. So far, all the problems we have faced here are service-related. The kitchen appears to be performing optimally.  I get up to use the bathroom and it is occupied. I get up later and try again and it is occupied. I get up a third time to use it and finally it is free. Why the hell does a restaurant this size have a restroom for only one person at a time. It clearly needs a larger restroom. Strike 4.  I ask for the check and it arrives quickly. I place my credit card on the check and we wait. And we wait. And we wait some more. Strike 5.  The place was not very busy and the service was still awful. But the food was delivered quickly and tasted great. My advice for managers is to do some serious re-engineering on your service quality with a particular focus on servers and hosts/hostesses. And while you're at it, give the folks in the kitchen a pat on the back for a job well done."}
{"text":"Its good food.  Its just not the greatest food for the price you pay.  I had a spicy chicken of some sort, and they dont mess around when it comes to the spicy stuff.  This stuff was HOT.  I enjoyed it quite a bit, but I just didnt feel like the food justified the price.  $11 for a lunch special?  No thanks.  I would give the food 4 out of 5 stars though."}
{"text":"Came here with the s/o for Arizona Restaurant Week. The experience started off amazingly with a Yelp reservation that allowed us to add special requests. We requested a booth (which we never do in-person without prompting), which was graciously accommodated.  We ordered the beef lettuce wraps, the bibimbaps, and the chocolate volcano to finish up the meal. The waitress was awesome: super on top of things and funny to boot. The beef lettuce wraps were AMAZING. The s/o never has good things to say about lettuce wraps, and actually liked these ones quite a bit!e The freshness of the lettuce and the sweet spicy tender beef all came together in just.. the best way.   Unfortunately, the bibimbaps were not so impressive. The waitress said that this was the most popular thing on the menu that people raved about, which honestly, given the number of good korean places around the Valley, surprises me. Bibimpbap is one of my favorite dishes in any cuisine, and I've never had a bibimbap that I didn't love, except for this one. The \"bibimbap\" was just fried rice with a chicken and veggie stir-fry on a skillet (that wasn't even hot enough to cook the egg a little (thankfully, I like my egg runny)). No gochujang, no separation of the different veggies to have different flavors.... all in all, really disappointing. The flavors were fine, but it unfortunately didn't feel like an homage to Korean food, more like an insult."}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in town! Best things on the menu: calamari, lettuce wraps, firecracker chicken tacos, seafood hot pot, but honestly there not much on the menu that isn't good. The staff is unbelievably friendly and you can tell they like their regulars. One of my favorite things about this bar is their beautiful patio that is also dog-friendly!"}
{"text":"My cousin lives in the Phoenix area and suggested we meet her here for dinner.  We headed over from our hotel and found a 45 minute wait for a table, so we signed in and sat at the bar.  The bar had 4 employees behind the bar, but it still took them a while to get to us (hate to see them work a Vegas bar), our bartender asked if we would be eating at the bar, we replied NO just wanted drinks.  I asked him if they had any signature drinks that he would recommend, he looked at and said, \"we have them, but no one orders them\" then handed me a menu and said here look at these.  His lack of confidence in their signature drinks made me rethink them QUICKLY and I said, \"never mind, I'll order an old favorite of mine.  I'd like a Grey Goose martini, up with a lemon twist\".  Hubby had to throw his order in quick, because this boy was already turning away from us.  He poured me a shot of Goose with a lemon wedge and handed me the drink.  I looked at hubby and shrugged, hubby was handed his drink we cheered and I went to take a sip and realized my glass was VERY broken.  I flagged the bartender down and he actually gave me a side look with a FINGER (not that famous middle one) and told me to WAIT.  When he finally came up to me with ATTITUDE, I gave it right back to him with.  LOOK (as I lift the glass in line with his eyes) do YOU see a problem with THIS???  His face fell, attitude dropped, apologized under his breath and then grabbed the glass and was going to leave, when my husband decided to explain to him in step by step instructions on how to make a martini.  I finally received a martini with a lemon twist, so he did know what they were.  surprise surprise.  When my cousin arrived and sat with us he NEVER came to get her order, in fact he never even looked our way again.  This bartender needs a MINUS star review   When our remote went off, hubby went and told the hostess that we couldn't get our bartender's attention and could she please forward our bar bill to the table.  We never got charged for our drinks, (his apology? or ?)  The restaurant has lots of space, I loved that they do not shove in as many tables as they can, and even though we were in the center of the room, we still felt private.  Our server was fast and very attentive.  They have a nice menu, but the food is neither traditional or fused enough to stand out.  It was an OK dinner, we enjoyed our company better.  We ordered the crab ragoons, they are very generous with the crab mixture, chili sauce tastes jarred.  Nachos, were not made well.  each ingredient was measured and placed on the plate, but nothing was spread over the entire area of wonton chips, became hard to eat and get that perfect bite.  Wonton chips were very thin and broke easily, you definitely need a fork for assistance.  Edamame, again, salted but only on top in a small area.  Uncle Fu's fried rice, it was ok and cousin loved her chicken rice soup, I think it was called Long Life.    Biggest stand out for me, because this is VERY unusual, I had to order bottled water with my meal.  The tap water was so disgusting in flavor that even with the lemon wedge I could not power through it.  They brought their casino labeled bottled water, I wasn't given a choice.  All in all not one of my worst or favorite meal experiences."}
{"text":"Always great food and service here.  I probably eat here twice a week.  Love sitting outside at the bar while the weather is nice!  General lings chicken, the orange chicken, and the Buddha Feast are my goto dishes."}
{"text":"I've missed this place because it's sort of \"set back away\" from Shea Rd, IMO. Or, maybe I drive fast and just blur by it.  I'm glad I stopped last night to try them out. Granted, it was take-out, but I was lusting for some Pad Thai. They do a nice one - excellent/vibrant flavors and generous chunks of moist chicken and shrimp.   Tried Chicken Lo Mein as well. Noodles were of good quality and nice and firm. Flavors worked well and ample chicken pieces.  I wish Take-Out orders would be handled by Hostess or other, in lieu of Bartender at very busy bar. I felt like sort of a tool and \"in the way\" standing by ppl seated at bar w/not a seat free.  Not a huge deal though. :)  *NOTE: Parking is viciously competetive around 5-7pm on weekday evening, if you're cheap like me and don't valet. LOL"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time after reading a couple reviews. Don't know what these people had but we only  had pot stickers and calamari and spent the next day on the toilet!!!! Since I had nothing else to eat before our late lunch or after we ate here it was no question what caused the problem. We will never eat there again.  EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!"}
{"text":"Been eating here since it opened and we really like it.  The food is consistently good and unique, the service very good and the price reasonable.  They have added an open bar and patio that we can't wait to try when it gets warmer.  (yes, I know it's warm if you're from Chicago.  I'm not)  We had some of the old punch cards and they not only honored them, they gave us two free lunches!  Unexpected and appreciated.  Very unique place, great to take visitors or someplace new to go."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Ling & Louie's for the first time during our recent vacation in Scottsdale. I had the Kickin' Kal-bi Sumo Roll. I did not realize the roll came with a dressing/sauce inside. I asked if they could remake it for me without the dressing/sauce and they were happy to do so. Kevin had the Shanghai Shrimp and Scallops. He enjoys a lot of spice so they offered to add some sambal paste to his dish. Both dishes were generously sized and full of amazing flavor. Ashlee provided stellar service - we really enjoyed chatting with her! We will definitely visit Ling & Louie's again during our next visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I was surprised at how good the food was.  I had the beef asparagus and mushroom dish, I forget what they call it  they use really fresh ingredients and it shows.  Its cheap compared to the same restaurant in Vegas and I would go there on the reg.  I like spicy food and asked for my dish spicy and it was so so. Service is at or below average, but not terrible."}
{"text":"This place is one of the few legitimate Asian Fusion restaurants in the PHX/Scottsdale area.  Great service, very tasty food, a full bar and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was a really disappointing meal for us while staying at the hotel. We started with a tuna appetizer. I almost gagged after the first bite. The fish tasted spoiled and smelled pretty rotten. We then had a chicken and beef dish. The beef dish was okay but not much for the price. The chicken dish tasted like it was something that you pick up in the frozen food aisle of the grocery store. The server was great but all in all not a good experience and would not go back."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese food. We had the tofu and veggies lunch special. It was okay, and was a lot of food for the price. The best part was the soup. They charge $1 per person for tea.... I guess the days of getting complimentary tea at Chinese restaurants is fading away."}
{"text":"Fun place,  great HH prices,  and Ashley was an awesome bartender. It was close to closing time and she made sure everyone was taken care of. She wasn't concerned about trying to rush everyone along so she could go home. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love the food here and typically love the servers. I eat here at least twice a month and the food will never fail you, its that good of quality. Noramlly get the coconut shrimp, edamame and sushi off of the appetizer menu and the jeweled beef or Buddha's feast off of the entree menu. Our server this time around had zero customer service skills and zero personality.  She walked up to our table and was like 2 ft away asking what we wanted to drink.  Didn't introduce herself or anything. No smile at all...seemed miserable. If it wasnt for the food i would be giving this place and experience this time around 2 stars."}
{"text":"I love the Strawberry spinach salad. I kniw crazy choice for an Asian restaurant. I've had it probably 6 times. Paul the  bartender is great. You bnb would think he owns the place based on his  service and knowledge"}
{"text":"This place has become a Favorite of mine, from the bathrooms to the AWESOME service, to the overly delicious Food, Ling & Louie's is a Big Hit!  The Chicken Lettuce Wraps blow the pants off of  PF Chang's.  And during Happy Hour they are 5 bucks along with the Crispy Calamari which was the BEST tasting Calamari I've had anywhere! We also tried the tacos, Both the Firecracker Chicken and the Ahi Poke explode flavors all through your mouth leaving you wanting more and more. The tacos came with an Awesome tasting Fried Rice for a $1 more I believe, steamed rice white or brown are the other choices to go with your Tacos.  We washed it all down with the with a warm flavored Inkberry Shiraz Cabernet & a Great tasting Kona Brewing Co. \"Big Wave\" Golden Ale. Prices are Right on Time during Happy and I am a fan for life of this restaurant.  If you can get a seat in Amanda's area you will be treated King and Queen. She knows a lot about everything on the Menu and almost all the drinks. She and the rest of the staff seem to enjoy their jobs and walk around with lots of Smiles! Management came to check with us after our meal and I pretty much told him I be back and others will too!"}
{"text":"We recently ordered takeout for a family get together from here and then drove to pick it up. The service was extremely fast and friendly. We placed the order, they told us it would be ready in 20 minutes, and when we walked in the restaurant less than 20 minutes later, our food was just coming out. It was packed nicely and easy to transport. My husband and I tried the miso soup, pot stickers, and the Jeweled Beef. All were delicious! The beef in particular was extremely tender and juicy. Very flavorful as well!   The food was so good, my husband and I decided to come back and try them for happy hour/dinner. During happy hour, they have a menu of drinks/appetizers that are only $5. There are a lot of HH items and we have tried the pot stickers, chicken satay, crab crunch roll, and crispy calamari. For drinks, we've only tried the Frozen Thai Mai but it's so good. I would highly recommend it! They do have some signature Mules, so I might try one in the future.   On a lunch trip, I tried the New Wave Pad Thai. It was different from other Pad Thai I've had, but it was still delicious. It came with both chicken and shrimp. My husband tried the Evil Jungle Princes with shrimp. He said it was delicious.  Overall, I love Ling and Louie's. It's a great place for Happy Hour, lunch or dinner. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fire the red headed \"Chuck\"ie doll he was so awful only came to our table once never refilled our water and took forever to serve us it wasn't even rush hour it was a chill sunday afternoon and we saw his coworkers countless times being so helpful to other customers the food was ok Thai Basil is better and cheaper  Update: john b i didn't ask u what u thought was necessary"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for many reasons. The food is very unique large portions, many locals sitting at the bar, because bartenders are totally on top of there customers service. Not to mention the patio so cool"}
{"text":"2.5 stars. I'll round down rather than up as 3 is far too generous.   This is not Chinese. It's (only somewhat) Asian-esque.  Essentially the flavors are Asian, sort of, but it ends there.   Service is adequate if unpolished.   L&lL fits right into the Phoenix area, certainly not known as a city for serious food devotees.  People seem to like this place. The food is decidedly unserious (but not in a good way); horribly sweet, poorly presented, much like \"Chinese\" food one would find in any food court in middle America.  L&LL wouldn't last two weeks in any city with a clue but as this is Phoenix, well...   Not recommended."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  The food is exceptionally good and very fresh and full of strong flavor.  I describe this cuisine as Americanized Asian food.  I like that they offer an option of brown rice with all the meals, and you can substitute most of the meats for tofu if you like that.  The Evil Jungle Princess is my absolute favorite.  A sweet and spicy peanut sauce on top of chicken, mushrooms, onions, and crispy fresh green beens that are cooked just the right amount so they snap when you bite into them.  I also love the Wango Mango chicken with big chunks of mango.  Everyone always loves the New Wave Pad Thai.  The Teriyaki Salmon is cooked to perfection, on top of a bed of wasabi mashed potatoes and green beens.  The Firecracker chicken tastes like wing sauce, so if you like wing sauce you will like this.  Otherwise you might want to pass.  The best part of this restaurant is the kids meals.  They serve them in a Bento Box, with little square compartments for each portion of the meal.  It's a great value that comes with a main dish of either noodles and chicken or wonton chicken, and edamame, and fried wontons with sweet and sour sauce, and a whole large bag of M&Ms, that the waiter was smart enough to secretly hand me on the side instead of serving it up with the rest of the meal."}
{"text":"I went with a group for lunch on 3/15/18.  Had heard about this place so thought I would try it.  I had the New Wave Pad Thai.  I don't know what was new wave about it.  I have had better pad thai from the frozen section of Trader Joe's.  This place is pricey for the caliber of food you get.  Tried it and won't be back.  I have had much, much better Asian food in the valley."}
{"text":"For us, if we don't want to travel too far for Chinese food, we come here.  This evening it was cold, windy and raining, but that didn't keep the diners from patronizing this restaurant. Even tho' it was packed, there were still one or two tables available. We both ordered hot tea to start with. It's not your loose leaf tea, but an assortment of your flavored tea bags. The hot water comes in a cast iron looking tea pot, but once you start using the hot water, it cools down pretty fast. After ordering, we placed the menus on our table which stayed there until we left. Good thing it was a table for four. Since Happy Hour is from 3-7 PM M-F and 11AM-3PM Saturday and Sunday; nightly from 9-close, we ordered the Crab Crunch Roll which was just as good as the last time we had it. My wife ordered the Sizzling Chicken and Pork which she enjoyed and ended up taking half of it home. I had the Lucky Lo Mein with Pork. There was fresh sprouts, carrots and green onions on top of the noodles. The noodles seemed a little bland and tad greasy. The pork was cut into chunks which made them settle to the bottom of the bowl. I think the meat should have been sliced thinner so that when you picked the noodles the meat would join the ride to your taste buds. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I want to be clear that I am picky about places with Asian influence as it is one of my absolute favourite kinds of foods. Long and Louie's takes the California fusion bistro concept way past the more famous rival PF Chang's! I want to say that I might be being stingy and unfair by not giving full marks but they probably deserve it. My two visits have both been satisfying.  I have to stress that I am very picky when it comes to Asianesque cuisine a it is my favourite food.  Ling and Louie put creative thought into the fusion bistro cafe concept and they indeed seem to \"approach love and cooking with reckless abandon\"!  I am a fan. I am probably not being fair to them by being a bit stingy with the fifth star, but... I am sure a few more visits and drunken chickens later and I can be swayed to loosen my clench.   I am a fan of their crab wonton. This classic is done tastefully and not just laden with cream cheese. You can actually identify the crab meat in them! And the sauces sweet with gingery tones. Yum. I went a ahead and also tries their signature rice dish...Uncle something... I don't remember Uncle's name but I'm crying for mercy with the blessing of this light and simply delicious offering . I'm glad they don't spoil this one by trying too many things with it: just good quality ingredients. I had a chicken and shrimp combo."}
{"text":"Ate here on a lunch date today. Excellent fare.  Ordered calamari, crab puffs and seared Ahi Tuna.  Simply fantastic.  I ordered Pad Thai and my wife ordered honey walnut chicken. Both were top notch. Everything was out and on our table within 20 minutes.  Great timing and service. I highly recommend the place for lunch.   I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I have only been here once, but it was a great experience. The servers seem to make a point to ask and remember your name which is nice. I had Ling's seafood hot pot, which was great and served in a neat black kettle. There was an assortment of seafood in a green curry broth. It consisted of shrimp, scallops, mussels and fish with your choice of rice. They are not skimpy on the seafood. It was loaded. Great atmosphere and service. I will have to try more of their food if I am in the area again.. And maybe update my review."}
{"text":"My Crab Crunch roll was mostly rice plus cucumber. Bad ratio. Luckily, I brought my handy dandy monocle to see that there was a tiny bit of crab inside too.   The Honey Walnut chicken is pretty good. The chicken lo mein was filling but tasted a bit off.   Service was friendly, but lacking. Maybe they didn't like my monocle."}
{"text":"I really really liked the food here.   We stopped in here after visiting our newborn nephew at the hospital because we were starving. I got the jeweled beef noodle bowl and it was probably one of the best steak dishes I have ever had.   The weird thing was that we walked in and stood for a min because we weren't sure if we were supposed to seat ourselves or not. We eventually started to walk towards a table and finally someone stopped us and sat us. I will definitely go back, just not with great frequency because it's a bit too pricey for what I like to spend on a place like that. But good food."}
{"text":"It's not everyday when you can describe a restaurant as 'different' and it's a good thing.  But, Ling & Louie's is different from what you expect when you go out for chinese, and that's what made dining there a wonderful experience.  The food certainly isn't \"authentic\" american chinese, but it certainly is fun.  Here's a rundown of the food my party of four spilt:  Louie's Loaded nachos. Wonton chips with cheddar-jack cheese, chicken, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, hoisin BBQ sauce, wasabi sour cream and \"asian\" guacamole. Delicious.  I highly recommend trying this appetizer.  Honey Walnut Chicken Crispy chicken and mushrooms in a creamy honey sauce with candied walnuts. Awesome!  The chicken was not too heavily breaded, the sauce was sweet, and the candied nuts were an unexpected treat.  Mongolian Beef. Pretty much your standard order.  This one is perfect for someone just looking for typical asian.  Not bad, but not special.  Beijing Duck Noodles Duck with noodles and vegetables. A good try, but not very good.  There was only a small amount of duck hidden in the dish.  The duck also wasn't very flavorful.  I wouldn't recommend this one.  There's so much on the menu that looks different, interesting and good.  If you're looking for asian, but are tired of the same old, same old, then give Ling & Louie's a much deserved time.  And if you're looking to save a few bucks, Ling & louie's is on local dines (https://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485) with a $30 for $15 gift certificate.  But a word of warning, it's a popular one that sells out fast."}
{"text":"Tried the long life chicken/rice soup & beef and broccoli  tonight.. They were delish!  Will definitely be visiting again soon.. Probably even just for a quick bowl of soup.  Yes, it is THAT good!"}
{"text":"We sat down for dinner and it took 30 minutes to get our edamame... and while we were eating another server came by and was surprised that we already had our edamame as she had another on her tray. When our server got back finally to take our order, we were done eating our appetizer so we just asked for our dinner to go. We got our check and waited another 45 minutes to get our take out. Also, the take out order after waiting 30 minutes for edamame was just fried rice and salad... why does fried rice and salad take 45 minutes to prepare? Worst service I've ever had."}
{"text":"Only thing I miss about working in Scottsdale is Ling & Louie's Orange Peel Chicken. Awesome."}
{"text":"I love the Orange Peel chicken. The flavors are great and the service is always very great too. If you can, try and make it for Happy Hour, $5 apps!"}
{"text":"Eh mediocre happy hour, kinda pricy comparatively, big place, mostly fried stuff, coconut shrimp were pretty tasty. Covered parking would have been nice I parked in back and found shade. Outside seating was hot no misters"}
{"text":"Been back lotssssss of times since my last review. Still love the Asian Nachos best. Uncle Foo's Fried Rice with the Filet is also one of my faves.   Staff is  always nice. Place is always clean.  If I could move in, I probably would. Gonna guess that would be frowned upon though."}
{"text":"My bf and I decided to go to Wild Horse Pass and casino last night. We arrived at the casino and I was starving. We decided to check Ling and Louise. I am so glad we did!  Even with the resturant closing in 45 minutes we still got stellar service, delicious, hot and fresh food.  I got the luck lo mein with chicken and my bf got a Big Burger in Little China. My food was so hot I burned my mouth several times because I was trying to eat it so fast because it tasted so good.  Average pricing seems to be around $14 a plate. Portion sizes are large.  A server was super friendly. He checked on us the perfecrt amount of times and packed my leftovers for me (which I forgot in the car.. devasted)  I also noticed next door was an express Ling and Louise's for a quick bite instead of sitting down."}
{"text":"This place definitely deserves all 5 stars. We came here on a recent trip to Scottsdale and this was recommended to us. We sat down and were promptly met by our waitress. She explained the menu to us and how the menu is set up. They have a great beer selection for Asian fusion and they were more than willing to let us sample a few that we haven't heard of before. Also, if you check in on Yelp, you get free Edamame. The portions are very big and the service was great. Below you will see what we ate.  Food: Edamame: done just right with a good amount of salt Potstickers: You can tell they are homemade. I wasn't a huge fan but I like the store bought ones. The other 2 people I was with really enjoyed them. Lings Seafood Hot Pot: Fantastic- the curry and coconut milk go together perfectly. It had a lot of mussels in it and it was really good. Just spicy enough but the coconut helped calm it. Budda's Feast with steak- steak was done perfectly and the portion was huge. I got mine with the brown rice and it complimented it well. The veggies were cooked to perfection and the sauce was awesome. I am so sad I left my leftovers at the place we were staying. Surf and Turf- Again, another excellent dish. The portion was great, steak was cooked just right, lots of veggies and the shrimp was not overcooked at all. We got the fried rice with this one and wow- best fried rice I have ever had. It was fresh and you could certainly tell.  I very much recommend going there. I wish there were one closer that I could go to again. The only tip I would give to people going there is: don't order too many apps because the portions are big and you will get full quickly."}
{"text":"It's been two weeks since we had dinner here.  Our waitress Alicea suggested ordering two items from the special birthday menu and the dessert is on the house.  The special menu is for a limited time with entrees not offered on the regular menu. For our appetizer we ordered the pork satay. Three huge, tender juicy pieces of pork got our taste buds off to a yummy start. My husband's entree, the \"Evil Jungle Princess\" made with Filet Mignon and a peanut red curry sauce is on the regular menu. He enjoyed every bite...so did I. The red curry sauce is spicy spicy on the tongue, though a sip of the \"Thai Mai\" frozen drink was a quick fix. And speaking of this drink, it's a must to order.  (Much better flavors than the traditional Mai Tai.) I ordered from the special birthday menu. My entree was called \"Crispy Whole Fish\". As a waiter delivered it to our table the other diners heads turned with curiosity. It was a huge Red Snapper and yes the head, tail and fins still in tack! Every bite of the fish was perfectly moist. We forced ourselves to finish the Snapper since it was so scrumptious! This entree needs to be offered on the regular menu. The vegetable fried rice was fluffy and tasty with a hint of spiciness. (It wasn't oily like other Asian/Thai restaurants here in the valley make their rice.) The second side dish ordered was the wasabi mashed potatoes which was a perfect complement to both of our delicious entrees. And last was the complimentary dessert.....the Chocolate Volcano with vanilla bean ice cream.  We had our waitress box it up since we were full from eating all of the above food. This dessert can be ordered from the regular menu.  At home, later in the evening, we ate the Volcano. A great dessert, it was not to sweet. We're headed back to Ling and Louie's this week and you need to try it too!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Ling & Louie's in Scottsdale, but this location is closer so we decided to have dinner here. One appetizer, one entree, and a dessert was enough food for my husband and I. The blackened ahi tuna tasted good and the price/portion was typical, but I wouldn't get it again and would probably just stick with their calamari (it's delicious!) for more bang for your buck. The honey walnut chicken was on point with flavor but the grease in the batter they use for the crispy chicken got overwhelming after a couple bites. The creme brulee was amazing and the fresh strawberries on top were very refreshing.  The food here is great, it is just unfortunate how they don't have happy hour like at the one in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised that this is 3.5 star. The food is amazing the chicken rice soup is the best I've ever had. They use filet in all of there steak dishes and the price is reasonable. I wish it was closer to my house."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food great, but the waitress was horrible. She spilt food on my dad for got my moms drink for over 10 minutes after she had taken her cup. I'm not gonna let her ruin it cuz the food sells itself!"}
{"text":"This is a great local restaurant with great food and fun cocktails."}
{"text":"We have dined here over a dozen times and I've tried many things on the menu. Everything has been really great. My favorite is the sizzling salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes. If you like meat the sliders are great! The honey walnut shrimp is tops too. I love their brown rice it is really tasty. They have great desserts too. You really can't go wrong on this place. The only thing is that sometimes the music is a little loud, but the great food is worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant I love the peppered beef, this is the only place I have been to that can get the beef right and keep it nice and moist packed full of flavor. The staff is nice, the service is quick and the food is amazing. Down to the way they present it, this place never misses a beat"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. We came in for lunch and got the calamari to start. This was good, a solid 4. We also ordered the shrimp fried rice and firecracker chicken noodles. The rice was kind of cold and bland. The shrimp on top was decent though, so the dish overall was a 2. We ended up not eating most of it, save except for the shrimp. The firecracker noodles with blue cheese and fried chicken pieces- phenomenal. I would never have thought to put those flavors together, but they worked so well together. I'd definitely go back just for that."}
{"text":"Fantastic service throughout.  Paul, (Working the Bar HARD) was fantastic.  Best customer service I have experienced in a long time.  Top grade Chinese food and the manager even touched our table to confirm.  Not too close to my office circuit, but will TRY to make this a regular stop based on this experience.  Great Job...."}
{"text":"Everyone gave it great stars, the service was terrible as was the food I ate , Everyone raved about the mussels. The worst ever. fishy tasting over cooked couldn't eat it pita pita garlic triangles  really? and how are you soaking up the sauce? I am a mussel lover grew up in the northwest so that it self ruined it their.   It took for ever to get the food despite their was no one in the restaurant. God forbid you order a drink they poor to a tee measure everything and over charge. The pad Thai no flavor little bang for the buck go to VIG  on 44th street much better better and it isn't even Asian.  We came because it had good rating clearly people don't know food or they had bad cooks that day.   I would not recommend or ever go there again."}
{"text":"Hostess on both visits was a little slow and didn't seem to want to work. After being seated, the experience sky rockets. Both times, Kham was our server and he is awesome! He gives you privacy as while interacting with you often; a great balance in a server. He's always moving a mile a minute and cares about guests' needs.  The food is amazing! We've had the chicken skewers, jeweled beef, evil jungle princess, firecracker and the deep fried banana with ice cream. All the ingredients have so much flavor. I hate it when I go to a restaurant and it tastes like something I can whip up on my own. I don't know how Ling and Louie's packs so much flavor in their food, but I love it!  I can't forget to mention the atmosphere. The decor is great and kind of relaxing. Even though it's in the casino, you feel more in a restaurant. The smell just pulls you in. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Pricey, but I would go back again. Nice ambiance. I had a noodle dish (I can't remember its name). Friendly bartender."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience with my friends at Ling & Louies yesterday. I used to worked for Ling & Louies so I know that the food is awesome! If you like food with a spice this is the plafe for you. We had a great time and I enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Omg every time I go to Ling and Louie's they Never disappoint the food is awesome and delicious I had the chicken and rice soup a little spicy and taste wonderful then I had the ahi  tuna the coleslaw there is so good and I'm not even a coleslaw fan and for my dinner I had chicken and pork sizzling skillet amazing I would recommend anyone to go to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Michelle was the worst server. If you don't like your job and have a bad attitude find a new career.   We ordered drinks. (2 of us)  it took 15 mins.  We ordered 2 appetizers and asked to keep the menu as it was our 1st time there and would like to order more... One app was a crab crunch roll the other was an order of lettuce wraps. Crab crunch had a hair in the side of ginger. Lettuce wraps were alright.  We never saw our server, we had to get our own chop sticks and soy sauce.   We waited 25 minutes for the apps. Our drinks were gone by the time the apps came.  WE NEVER SAW OUR SERVER!!  She knew we wanted to order more as we explained.  When she finally came back we asked for the check and she was so rude. We explained how we had a hair on our plate, drinks were empty, we wished to order more, and we haven't seen you in 30 min.  She was the worst server we have ever had. Will not be back. I will also tell everyone I know not to go there.  We even asked the bartender to get our server. Which he did and she yelled at him.  We are shocked at the service. Whoever hired this girl needs to rethink!!!!"}
{"text":"Glad we tried. Having finished an appointment in Scottsdale early, we pulled over to look/phone search for a place to grab an early lunch, and Ling & Louie's Asian Bar and Grill was starring us in the face, looked up some Yelp reviews and decided to give it a try.  We were greeted and seated right away. our server Sherry (nice touch on the card) was excellent. We ordered the Edamame, Tom Kha Gai (Green curry coconut broth, tomatoes, mushrooms, diced chicken, cilantro and Thai basil), Orange Peel Chicken (Sweet citrus-soy sauce, freshly grated orange zest, served over crispy spinach Crispy Chicken), New Wave Pad Thai (Ling's modern take on this Thai classic. Rice noodles with shrimp, chicken, egg, fresh vegetables and chopped peanuts in a sweet tamarind-chili sauce), and Ahi Poke Tacos (Three tacos filled with wok-seared sashimi-grade ahi, onions and cabbage, topped with spicy aioli and Asian salsa)  The Food was very good, fresh and tasty. The service was excellent. I would definitely be back for lunch. I also signed up for the Wokstar rewards card and was pleasantly surprised as I log into the web site that there was a location in Chander which is much closer to us."}
{"text":"Overpriced Ok food.. a few bad/fake servers (grim reaper  tattoo girl)"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and really want to love it ....but just can't.    Lunch this week was just okay.  Our server Jill was very enthusiastic and efficient.  For some reason this place is noisy in a very annoying way.  We endured clinking, clacking and other such kitchen/bar distractions during most of our meal.  Try having a conversation!    We ordered meatloaf sliders w/ fries (I know, at an Asian place no less!) and pad thai.  The sliders were okay but at $11.95 not a value.  Pad thai lunch-portion was $7.95 - a bowl of noodles w/ some chicken & shrimp and a few onions & shredded carrots.  I guess next time I want \"Asian\" I'll go all the way to a Real Chinese restaurant.  On the upside, I counted 7 different kinds of sake on the menu.  If you're a sake drinker, maybe this makes up for the so-so food?"}
{"text":"Food gets 3 stars - service gets 1. Stopped in around 8:15 on Saturday night. First service was thinning out and we were seated immediately. Server greeted us after 15 minutes for our drink order. It wasn't a good a start and we considered leaving. We ordered the lettuce wraps for an appetizer with our drinks - given we had ample time to read the menu. Three waters and a coke arrived quickly. The lettuce wraps were out in 5 minutes, but for an unexplained reason, it took almost 10 for my San Pelligrino to arrive. The lettuce wraps were fair at best. The five small pieces of dehydrated romaine contributed to a disappointing first course. The three main dishes arrived 40 minutes after we ordered them. Two Dishes were cold. The third was fresh and hot. We were starving so we did not complain when Marcus finally checked on us half way through the dishes. We put the chop sticks down at 9:20 full and relatively satisfied. We waited 15 minutes for our check. We were getting impatient and scanned the restaurant for our server Marcus. I decided to stand up to make it clear we were ready to go. Marcus emerged and asked if we needed anything. I said, \"the check please, we need to get going. An hour and fifteen minutes is too long for dinner without drinks (cocktails).\" This is when our experience went from fair to bad. Instead of apologizing, Marcus replied in a frustrated tone, \"I checked on you four times.\" My guest quipped back, \"no you didn't.\" Marcus walked away mumbling under is breath. Then we heard him complaining to fellow employees loud enough for us and other guests to hear, \"what do they expect on a Saturday night. An hour and fifteen minutes not fast enough...\" When he repeated his rant, I approached him and said, \"you're gonna take the feedback personally and call me out in the middle of the restaurant? Not professional.\" I could have let it go, but have never experienced this kind rude behavior before. I walked away, paid the bill and left."}
{"text":"Ling and Louie's is Asian meets American. Always great. Happy Hour is awesome. Calamari, lettuce wraps, and Sushi rolls are to die for. Atmosphere is always up beat. They have such a great variety of drinks from beer to liquor to wine. You can tell the Owner/Chef or managers, really care about your experience."}
{"text":"The location and the atmosphere is inside the casino, with dim light, very comfortable for family or romantic mood ;)...and they still open late after 10 pm (score!) plus they have a very nice setting bar aside.  Crispy calamari was great, crispy, not salty or oily, although no dipping signature for this menu. Black Orchid Ahi, is my new favorite here! the sauce was tasty especially if you sprinkle lemon before you start eating. The service is great, fast, helpful, and friendly. Although they don't have ponzu sauce, they replaced it with sliced lemon and soy, quite close :). Overall, I had a great experiences here, I would like to go back to try something else."}
{"text":"I think this place is under new management, they aren't as good as they used to be and I absolutely hate it when my boss wants me to get us lunch to-go there.  The bartender Paul is space cadet among other things and gets my order incorrect at times and he is not pleasant at all.  They need to get rid of him, time to retire old bastard.  Anyway, they tend to put too much sauce on their dishes, even though the sauces are great.  They don't put as much meat in them as they used to and they have changed the menu up quite a bit.  Their meatloaf actually is really good.  The Orange Chicken is good but you have to eat it in house.  They do not have a great happy hour anymore, pretty expensive if you are looking for a deal."}
{"text":"Always delicious. Haylie was our awesome server and happily accomodated our custom request for a dish from their secret menu (past menus remembered by regulars like us). Their happy hour goes til 7 and has some great dishes. Favorite drink of mine is ginger lime Margarita (ask for straight up in martini glass)."}
{"text":"We were wanting to try this place for a while - we entered during lunch time and we were the only ones there so the wait service was awesome.  FYI:  they will only bring you water and chips if you request it otherwise they will not bring them.  I was disappointed in the menu it was not too big and most of there items were on the spicy side which our family does not eat.  Plus we have an allergy to soy and all there items have not only Soy but Genetically modified soy is the worse stuff ever... the wait staff did try to find me something to eat without soy and they did not realize Soy is the # 1 ingredient in mayo....so could not eat anything except the chips which were really good...They do have a gluten free menu but they should have a Soy free gluten free menu as well - so I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Everything was perfect for my birthday dinner. I got the London Mule drink and my bf got the house draft. We started with lettuce wraps, which were delicious. He got new wave pad Thai and I got the surf & turf. The entrees were great! The sauce wasn't overpowering and we each had enough for leftovers. Make sure to add the long life chicken rice soup. The cilantro and green onion pop in the soup. We finished off with the Banana cake. It tasted more like a delicious fried churro stuffed with banana. It came with fresh whipped cream, vanilla ice cream and strawberries AMAZING!!!! I hope a location will open in Illinois. Oh, and our server, Candy, was very sweet and attentive."}
{"text":"I don't quite know how to feel about ling & louies. On the one hand, the entree's themselves aren't spectacular or revolutionary, but the food is all cooked to near perfection. I would figure a place in North Scottsdale would be a bit more adventurous with their menu; but don't let this deter you from coming. The staff is very friendly and it does not feel canned. We had fun joking around with our waiter the most recent time. THe outside patio, despite facing a parking lot, is still nicely designed and can't be beat on a nice night in the valley. The food is very very tasty. I had the jewelled beef most recently and the meat was perfect and flavorful. My girlfriend for the ahi tacos (nothing like going for asian cusine and coming out of it with tacos) which were also awesome. Mongolian beef flat bread appetizer should be a must for everyone. My only gripes really are the lack of innovative plates and also wish they had more than 6 beers on draught. Regardless, at the very least you should just come for the experience of opening the massive front door...it's a blast. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars for the kids menu, which is very good compared to others we have seen. But when it comes to the regular menu I was very disappointed tonight. In the past, I would have given Ling &  Louie's 3.5-4 stars, always pretty good and a satisfying meal. However, they have changed the menu since the last time we have been and I don't know if that means things changed in the kitchen!?!  We started with an appetizer from the \"featured\" Vietnam menu, Summer Rolls $10.95, which I feel were worth $3.95 from a grocery store cold bar :( about 3-4 small pieces of shrimp with some veggies, very bland, and the sauce served next to them added nothing unfortunately. I ordered the Cashew Chicken Stir Fry and my husband the Mongolian Chicken. I again felt like it was something I could have ordered from a fast good Chinese restaurant, not terrible, but not what I would have expected from Ling & Louie's - same went for my husband. Not what we have experienced in the past from here.  Bottom line, food was mediocre at best and not sure with their prices that we will back now (which is disappointing since it used to be one of our go to places for Asian cuisine that pleased everyone). We defiantly don't mind spending $ for good cuisine but now would rather drive a little further and spend it elsewhere. :-/"}
{"text":"Food was good. And a nice wine selection. Not sure it is a competitive market for Scottsdale happy hour prices.  I would come back...but only for something special."}
{"text":"I ate here last night and ordered the General Ling's crispy chicken on a bed on fried rice. Great food and awesome service! Steve was our server and he was super attentive, punctual, and knowledgeable. Also, great drink! Thai Mai. Delicious! We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here Friday night for dinner.  It's one of her favorite restaurants, and I had never been before.  We sat outside, and had no trouble getting a table.    I ordered the Korean Salmon which came sizzling with asparagus underneath it.  The salmon was cooked perfectly!!!  I was so impressed!  And, it was delicious!  I asked for brown rice with it, which I would recommend doing.  It was a great evening with a great meal!"}
{"text":"I dig this place.  I like their menu a lot and think the filet sliders are the bomb!  The only thing that I have had and not liked that much was the pad thai.  Everything else has been very tasty.  I think I have tried the majority of the menu.  I also like the bar even though I have only sat at it once.  The service was good and the bartender poured solid drinks.  I hope this helps."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their service is friendly and everything I've tried on the menu for the last 2.5 years has been great. The calamari appetizer, half price at happy hour, is the best calamari in the country. And my airline pilot husband and I have traveled and eaten out a whole lot in the last 30 years. Our college student son likes the food as well. The Asian fusion cuisine works. You'll love it."}
{"text":"I would love this place, the waitress was very nice (in more than one way) and the food was delicious. But after feeding only myself for what I thought was one of the least expensive meals I walked out having spent about $25 including drink, dessert, and tip for only one person."}
{"text":"The wine and food pairings that are hosted at Ling & Louie's are the best I have ever been to.  The staff is knowledgeable especially the top managed John.  I have never liked sweet wines and reds that are too heavy but they got it so right. John even accommodated a vegetarian at our table without advance notice, I am impressed."}
{"text":"Great service, clean restaurant and good food! The coconut shrimp is really good. I was really impressed with the Ahi lettuce wraps. Warning: you will have to wrap them yourself so it can be a little messy. LOVED the bulgogi!!"}
{"text":"I'm an avid gambler so I've tried every eatery at the casino off my food comps. I usually leave a fat tip since I get my meals off the comps. I asked for my sizzling chicken and shrimp with spicy garlic sauce but no butter and they made it perfectly to order! The experience, atmosphere, service, and food make this place a must try!"}
{"text":"When Ling and Louie's first opened on Scottsdale, I went there a couple times, and frankly I was NOT a fan.  They were suffering from the \"new restaurant syndrome\" and things weren't consistent and service was off.  Now returning after a year or so, they have COMPLETELY changed things around.  I now consider this one of my favorite Asian Restaurants.  I've consistently had great service.  They always refill your drinks promptly and are friendly.  We've always gotten our food quickly, so I have no complaints.  My absolute favorites here are: -- For Adults, try the Thai Mai.  It's their version of a frozen mai tai with some rum floating on top.  It's to die for! -- the Mongolian Flatbread Appetizer.  OMG can I just say it's a amazing!  The spicy aioli and filet mignon blend perfectly! -- the Chicken and Rice Soup is so rich in Chicken, I'm shocked at what you get for the price. -- Loaded Chicken Nachos are a MUST try! -- The Buddha's Feast Chicken is delicious with huge pieces of Chicken and a lot of fresh vegetables. -- Firecracker Chicken and Broccoli is always a great standby.  It doesn't have a lot of flavor, but it's very spicy and delicious."}
{"text":"Ling & Louie's acts like upscale Chinese (fusion?) but feels like a chain.  The menu is far more imaginative than the usual Orange Chicken - Mongolian Beef oriental eatery, and that really works on some dishes, such as the Heavenly Buddha.  But other dishes are not so satisfying.  Consider a special the day I was there - duck noodles.  First, there was far too little duck.  Second the duck there was tasted like reheated leftovers with a poor flavor and a dried out consistency.  Third, the sauce was one-dimensional (sweet) and overwhelming.  A complete miss except for the noodles themselves.  The chicken and rice soup, which you can get for $1.50 with a meal, is quite a good deal but very salty.  I expect this in a place where the chef is only a cook, but not where the menu is studded with interesting sounding options.  Ling & Louie's is pretending to be something finer.  If it weren't it would rate four stars as a neighborhood quick oriental diner.  But you should try it - you might feel differently."}
{"text":"We came here as a couple of my friends recommended it.  AWFUL! We sat outside where there were only two other tables with customers, yet the service was horrendously slow. Infact we had to get up on two occasions to even find our server.  The soup arrived- COLD... and OMG I've never tasted so much salt. I had the curry soup that was so salty I couldn't eat it. My 11 yr old son had miso soup that was so salty he spat it out- my husband had chicken soup that was so salty he had to drink two glasses of water with it.  When I asked the waitress about the salt in all the soup her reply \"well they shouldn't taste too salty, the only one that does normally taste salty is the miso soup because of the MSG.\"    Then arrives the rest- the pad thai was ok, and just OK.  Their signature dish The Evil Jungle Princess was made with burnt barbecued chicken pieces that did not taste good and added a very odd flavour to a curry dish. They should have used the same chicken found in pad thai. By the end of this awful experience I left the restaurant like an evil jungle princess.   7/3/2017 Im a little late to post an update. After being contacted by the manager we went back- service was better. The soup we test tasted before ordering - they were still horrendously salty-  BUT the chicken lettuce wraps were beyond fabulous- infact they were so we good we ended ordering 3 orders of them--- Id go as far to say probably the best lettuce wraps in the city- they are not served with the usual fall apart/slivers of iceberg lettuce leaves, instead they use romaine  a most definite improvement over other restaurants leaf choice"}
{"text":"Tonight's guest performer, DONNY OSMOND!!! (craaaaaaaaahhhhhh!).  Yes, indeed, it was Friday night on the Rez and as we drove up, we watched the blood-red tendrils of a fading sun blazing the clouds over the Estrella's.  Why do I always catch sunsets like this when I cannot get to a camera?  Oh, well, on to the Casino.  No, I was not there to see Donny, but he was the headliner, and in my head that meant I would be battling a horde of seniors to get a seat in the dining hall.  Heck, according to Denny's I am a senior, but these people.  Well, they were up there.  Getting to the Casino was straight-forward, they have their own named exit on the I-10.  We spun in there about 6 pm and quickly found a spot in a garage with estate-sized parking spots.  I'm talking roomy here.  Heck, each spot here would equal two in California.  Swinging our doors wide, we easily exited and headed for the restaurant.  A short stroll and we found ourselves staring at the automatic doors- whoosh! and we are slammed with a wall of stale cigarette smoke floating on the stench of desperation propelled by the fear of losing that next spin on the gambling machines.  It smells just like every other Casino in Arizona and one would think with the billions of revenue they suck from these poor souls they could afford better scrubbers.  We strolled in like the ballers we are and followed the signs around to the restaurant.  Pushing through the crowds of elderly's, we made it to the line in front of what appeared to be the restaurant.  There were bamboo stalks, so we were pretty sure this was it.  We finally got to the host and got our little buzzer.  45 minutes, sir.  We wandered over to the bar and secured a couple of stools, waiting for something to kill the desire to break for the front door and fresh air.  The very busy bartender eventually came around, a husky white man with an Asian hairdo - the little balled-up ponytail in the back.  I think to myself \"how fucking cliche.\"  We order two \"Red Lotus\".  This is a drink made with Tequila, Ginger Liqueur, Rhubarb Bitters and Fresh Strawberry.  Steven Seagal heads over to the corner and starts playing with his bartender tools, making a big show for the casino-floor waitress while he muddles and shakes and strains our drinks.  Strolling back, he plops two old-fashion glasses partially filled with a vaguely pink liquid in front of us, garnished with a forlorn slice of lime. I'm sorry, he says, I'm out of highball-glasses so I have to use these.  The drinks looked like some kind of shot a frat-boy would order at a sports bar.  Can you at least put some ice in them?, I ask.  Oh, but that would dilute the liquor!  That's okay, I said, at least it would be cold.  The bartender returned with the drinks iced and proceeded to complain about how difficult it was to muddle and strain the fresh strawberries, it was a horrible drink in his opinion as it was too much work.  It didn't taste bad, we slurped them down while watching the other elderly patrons scarf their vaguely Asian looking dishes before the big concert.  90 minutes later, two quick pulses on the pager meant our table was finally ready.  For starters, Steamed Edamame and Black Orchid Ahi \"sushi grade\" tuna with an Asian slaw and spicy soy mustard.  Close to starvation at this point, we scarfed the apps and waited for our dinners.  The wife ordered the \"Evil Jungle Princess\" with seared scallops and I had \"Drunken\" with crispy chicken.  The waitress made a big show of pouring some volatile flaming liquid over my dish tableside, but said that she could not serve it while it was flaming.  So much for show.  My dish could easily be described as \"Sweet and Sour Chicken with white rice\" in most any other Asian place.  The volatile liquid tasted like rubbing alcohol.  I did not finish this dish, it was too sickly-sweet.  The wife loved her scallops, but left the rest of her dish alone.  We did not ask for doggie bags - that would have just been cruel to our little puggies.  After dinner, we sat and talked while our dishes of uneaten food congealed in front of us.  Summary - Atmosphere lame, I mean like food-court lame, service - overworked Casino people just hoping for their shift to end sooner than later. I give the waitress props, she was not that great, but in her defense, it looked like she was working the whole floor.  Price - not worth it.  Given the attitude and the wait time to get in here, followed by crappy food, I'll pass next and head on over to Pei-Wei for my vaguely Asian food fix."}
{"text":"On my honeymoon from Chicago and this restaurant by far has been the most amazing place I have ever eaten asian food in my entire life.  Aside from Matt at the bar which is what kept my husband and I coming back to dine here every single day and almost twice a day for a whole week, the pot stickers and Lord the crab wontons are EXQUISITE!!! Honestly I wish I can hire him and move Matt out to me for the unique inviting and warm individual he is!! My favorite has been the general Lings with crispy scallops as well as the Shanghai shrimp and scallops.  I am an absolute scallop snob and I would travel a whole day just to come out and dine here.  Thank you for making this special Matt and ling loius.... Honestly CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was fair, heavy on the sauce on our dishes and even the kids didn't like their noodles. Service was good, for the quality it was expensive."}
{"text":"Place has a line out the door. Which tells you something.  Their soap and salads are scrumptious. Portion sizes are enough for leftovers.  Pricing is reasonable for the excellent quality. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here. My boyfriend's been here a million times and he loves it, so I thought I would go with him and try it. I've been to a million Asian restaurants in my life and never have I had food like this before. 1st of all, mind you, I threw up 29 times last night, no joke. I had the worst food poisoning I think that I have ever ever had, from their food. I ordered their Hawaiian sweet and sour chicken. You would think that sweet and sour chicken is just going to be sweet and sour chicken right? No. This was super super spicy and to be honest it tasted like shit. I've NEVER had sweet and sour chicken that was spicy. It tasted terrible. They don't make it like that anywhere I've ever had it before. I guess that's their style, but I don't like it. it's gross. And like I said it was WAYYY too spicy. I didn't even finish it because I couldn't take it. And then I ended up like I said getting sick as a fucking dog all night long. I have chronic pancreatitis, so I really didn't need for this to happen to me. Since when do Chinese restaurants make their food spicy?? That is Lame. I won't be back. EVER."}
{"text":"Food are very salty! I prefer Bamboo Club in Scottsdale. Very bad experience, poor customer service. Staffs are not professional. I wouldn't recommended it."}
{"text":"One of the best asian restaurant I visited.Food and service is outstanding. I had the Buddha Feast with a chicken so yummy that I need to go back.  My friend had Evil Jungle Princess for me it was too spicy since I do not like spicy food but she loved it."}
{"text":"The food here is really awesome and delicious. Very flavorful and great full bar too! The ambience is great!  Their shrimp and beef dishes are wonderful."}
{"text":"I couldn't stand this place! I am actually very surprised other people gave it a good review. Aside from the service being very poor the food was nothing too exciting. I did like the spicy chicken and rice soup, however they brought me out the wrong soup the first time. I was also brought out the wrong drink too!   My date ordered a salad which was not bad, but not very good. There was too much dressing and it made everything else in the salad very soggy. I had the sweet & sour chicken, but was not impressed at all.   The food is not the worst, but I can get better Chinese food down the street from this restaurant. I do think the service was so bad that it did bring down the rating, I did get a laugh however because they seemed to mess up on everything we ordered like we were on a hidden camera show."}
{"text":"We were staying at the wild horse pass hotel for a mini staycation and for dinner, we decided to try this restaurant. It was pretty good! We were seated and greeted right away on a Tuesday evening. Our server, candy, gave us some suggestions of which items to try.   We started off with a Siamese chicken pork egg roll appetizer, the egg roll was good, with very crispy skin, but by itself it was only okay. If you use the sauce it came with, it was so delicious! I wanted more!  For the entree, I chose the Taipei pepper steak with brown rice. To me, it was very tasty and succulent. I ate the whole thing. I would recommend the dish to others and wouldn't mind coming back for the same dishes."}
{"text":"It's actually hard to find good Asian/Chinese/Thai. Food. There are dozens of choices but few stand out -- Ling & Louie's is certainly the latter. It's a newer local place that popped up in my Yelp search, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food -- no greasy noodles here, folks. The people who work there are friendly too (the bartender gave me a good lead on where to find more Japanese whisky selections). This is my new go-to place when I get a hankering for Chinese take out. Looking forward to exploring the menu"}
{"text":"Love Ling & Louie's! The Tom Kha Gai soup is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Saw this place many times and assumed it was not my type of place.  I am much more into authentic cuisine and not cutesy and forced.  I received a half price coupon however, so decided to give it a try.  I must say, even at half price it was not worth it.    We ordered the mongolian beef and mango chicken.  Was shocked when both dishes arrived layered over the rice.  If you were to remove the mound of rice from the middle of the plate, there might have been 3 tablespoons left of meat.  Not only were portions tiny, the texture of meats were all wrong.  Seemed artificial, at best.  Processed chicken texture.  Overcooked beef.  They claim it's filet mignon, and while it was tender, it was still not quite right.  Both dishes were very disappointing.  Crab wontons tasted good, but were not hot.  How can a deep fried dish arrive lukewarm?  Leads me to believe they are not freshly fried as you order, but maybe reheated.  Even the iced tea was bad.  After adding 5 sweet and lows, there was still no taste.  I have had that happen on occasion before.  Anyone know what that is from?  How can iced tea be tasteless?  I wonder if sweet and low can loose flavor or is there just not enough tea in the water when they brew it?  Maybe to save money on tea bags, who knows!  Service was casual and friendly.  Bar was busy.  Decent place for drinks I suppose.  Many seemed to like it.   I, however, did not.  We will never be back, not even at half price."}
{"text":"On Friday 3/16, I witnessed the worst customer service ever. The big guy bartender and his sidekick were blatantly rude to a customer at the bar. They were very busy, we all had to wait at least 15 min for a drink, and to top it off the bartenders were short,  rude and disrespectful.  If you're not going to hire enough people then at least employ better bartenders that don't talk crap about customers. Pathetic."}
{"text":"Terrific food and service. Spring rolls and pad Thai were great but I didn't like the shrimp that was on the pad Thai. It tasted like it may have been frozen and then thawed and then cooked well but not grilled or with much seasoning. Our waitress was very attentive and service was great! Will be back again"}
{"text":"Whoa the hostesses need to be trained or replaced!  They were clueless which resulted in multiple reservations delayed over an hour and several \"may I speak to your manager\" requests from different parties.  After an hour past our reservation and still no desire to get a table ready for us, not to mention that there were several tables open in multiple areas, we finally were able to sit down! Whew it was a nightmare!!    The only reason I gave them 3 stars is because the food was amazing and our server Candy was incredible!!  If they figure out their hostess situation they will be a great place to go eat! Thank you again Candy!!"}
{"text":"Our family LOVES this place!  It was one of the first restaurants my wife and I went to when we moved to the Valley in 2011 and it is our go-to \"wanna go out to eat tonight?\" place.  Even my Chinese in-laws love it.  You can't go wrong with the Evil Jungle Princess with any kind of protein, the filet mignon sliders, Asian meatloaf, the fried calamari, crab crunch rolls, etc, etc.  They have a happy hour with some of their apps half price.  Beware, parking is a PITA almost all the time!  It can be a bit expensive, two adults and two 3 year olds usually runs around $45 with no drinks and before tip, but it is a wonderful splurge for us."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant because my wife wanted to check out the Wild Horse Pass Casino. We decided for this asian restaurant and oh boy... I had the F'n Loaded Sliders and let me tell you: best sliders I have ever had in my life! Worth coming back just for that alone. My wife had the Pad Thai and that was okay as well. Visit this place... try the sliders"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last week with some friends on the recommendation of others in our condo. Nice outdoor patio. Lettuce wraps and a sushi roll for appetizers. Food was good as well as the service. Will be back next time for happy hour! $5 apps along with beer, wine and cocktail specials.   For dinner we had pad Thai, surf and turf, salmon and chicken cashew stir fry.  I asked for the chicken stir fry to be a little spicy...it was a lot spicy, so be careful with that request!  Others said their meals were good and there were some comments the appetizers were the best!  I agree!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST place for happy hour food. Ever.  I'm actually glad I never thought about happy hour for food at Ling & Louie's during the three years I worked next door. I would have spent so much money and consumed so many extra calories on the delicious food!  My favorite items are the Asian nachos, crab tempura roll, chicken satay, and the calimari. YUM. I always spend less than $20 here for 2 people to eat, and leave stuffed with leftovers in hand.  Service has always been quick, friendly, and consistent.   4/5 stars!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Asian fusion place. I typically go for lunch but I have also been for happy hour. Their Evil Jungle Princess is really good especially over the fried rice. Their salads are a good size and I love the miso soup. Service can be slow at lunch (and this why Ling's gets 4 instead of 5 stars) but this is still my top choice for a lunch spot."}
{"text":"I have to be careful for gluten-free needs and they were incredibly helpful. I first called down to ask about their GF offerings and were very knowledgeable, which is always reassuring (sometimes I just get a \"maybe\" or a \"come first then we can see if there are options\"). Once we arrived their menu has \"GF\" next to the options I could eat. They have GF soy sauce as well. The server was very diligent to make notes in his ticket order to the chef and I felt very comfortable ordering and eating there. And they didn't sacrifice flavor! It was delicious and we will certainly be back! Thank you L&L for providing a place for me to eat delicious Asian food! I don't get these options back home in my smaller Iowa town. (Pictured is my lettuce wrap made with GF soy sauce)"}
{"text":"Party of four we met here for lunch on a Thursday at midday the selection was wonderful the staff was courteous the presentation of the food was wonderful and the food tasted Marlows. They were running a Vietnamese monthly special and I had the Steak Pho.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"While my partner and I don't normally like chain restaurants Ling & Louie's is an exception. They're a small chain of only two restaurants they are franchising.   We both started with Miso soup which was okay. Then we moved on to Potstickers, on of our favorites. they were very good, but not outstanding. For our entree's I ordered Firecracker Chicken with Broccoli and my partner ordered Meatball Sliders. The Chicken was VERY spicy, but also very good. I didn't have room to try the Meatball Sliders but here they were also very good. All-in-all it was a pretty good meal and the service was perfect."}
{"text":"I did not eat here. Because the service was so poor.  I went to the bar. Sat there for about 5 to 10 min. The persons behind the bar. Wakes back and fourth in front of me 4 times and never said a word. Than went back to the other end of the bar to grab a bill. Waked back across in front of me and went to check on a table and still no greeting or anything. I left and went to stone and vine where the food and service was fantastic.  At 6ft 200lb it was the first time I felt invisible."}
{"text":"Sushi was good. The spicy edamame was really great and unique. The staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and always leave with the same feeling.  Good food, good service, unusual flavors, wanting to go back.  Simple as that!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner here.   The food had its own take which left me without something to compare it too, which is great.  There is a lot of great food out there, but being great and standing out on your own is harder to find.  The food did have a kick to it, but a good kick.  Being pretty mild as spice goes, I enjoyed it.  It was a little higher then my initial comfort level for some dishes, but I enjoy the increase.  I also really enjoyed the whiskey based cocktails.  Never done but with whiskey till I cam here, now I find myself ordering wherever I go.   So thank you for the amazing food, expending my horizons a bit and the great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'd give this place .5 star if I could.  Waited 45 minutes for a table last night - ok so we killed some time in the casino as we waited. Pan seared potstickers were served cold, told the waiter, waited for a 2nd serving, they were cold too.  Famous rice and chicken soup barely had any chicken in it at all.  Spicy ahi roll should be named NO spicy ahi, tons of rice roll - awful!  Sizzling surf and turf platter was very salty.  All in all very, very disappointing.  I've eaten lunch a the Ling and Louie's in the DFW airport it was 1000x better than thisl  Terrible and we will not go back!  How can you serve cold potstickers twice and not have a manager come by to apologize. Awful food, awful experience. I don't think anyone that works in this location cares about anything - not the food, not the customers, not the dining experience...someone better wake up and fix this place or it will not survive - and maybe that's a good thing."}
{"text":"A favorite of ours for birthdays and special occasions. The Evil Jungle Princess Beef is my go to dish!"}
{"text":"This visit was my first to 'LL's can't say I want to return anytime soon.  The service was fair and the food was about the same.  This location was situated in the wild horse pass casino and hotel which was my first time visiting.  My friends took me and my brother here while my visit back home.  Can't say I enjoyed the restaurant very much and that maybe just because the waitress may have had a bad day or weekend but it also seemed qto be bad attitudes around the entire staff...  I have personally always liked eating at casino's, I know super strange but this visit was not ideal and not bad just no fire unfortunately for LL's.  I ordered the evil jungle princess beef, when I noticed it on the menu I just couldn't resist.  I also order some soup which was nothing to rave about.  When my meal arrived the presentation for a $16 dollar plate was very poor.  I have payed for meals under $10 and gotten $30 presentations before but this was bad.  First bite was interesting and towards the middle to the end I just had enough.  I was hoping for more of what was described in the menu detail but the cook failed to sell me on it.  In the end LL's received stars based on performance and taste and I may be slightly more harsh on upper scale places but that's for a reason $.  My return to 'LL's may possibly happen again some day but not soon."}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight... Not impressed. With anything, really. Flatbread was greasy, princess chicken wasn't tasty or spicy as advertised. Spring rolls came with old cilantro- dried out, discolored leaves. I'm being generous with 2 stars."}
{"text":"I had great time here! My boyfriend and I stopped in and had the surf and turf and lo mein. YUMMM. Our server was great I feel awful I don't remember her name. We really enjoyed the atmosphere. We had an excellent dessert which I believe was a banana roll. I highly recommend this place. To top it off the manager came over and checked in with us I cannot remember her name but she was a pretty blonde lady. It was nice to see that the entire staff cared as well as management to ensure we were enjoying our meal.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the casino for many years and never ate here even though I've had countless recommendations. I finally went and it was delicious. I tried the meatloaf because of the previous recommendations and it didn't disappoint. The mashed potatoes were also very flavorful. I know it seems weird to order meatloaf at an Asian restaurant but it's on their menu for a reason. Try it!"}
{"text":"Decided to have my Birthday dinner here so happy with my choice.  Saturday night they had an hour wait.  Food was delicious and well worth the wait.  Food had awesome flavor and we can't wait to come back.  Firecracker chicken was yummy and just the right amount of spicy.  My husband got walnut shrimp it was delicious."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere and waitstaff. Happy hour apps are a great value. Happy Hour drink prices are only ok. Try the crispy calamari...it's excellent!"}
{"text":"Menu is ok, service is subpar. Waitress Amanda was not pleasant and seemed annoyed to serve my party of four. I have gone to this place a few times before but after tonight's experience I will now take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and I've had a great experience every time! The staff are always friendly and the menu is very accommodating for practitioners of alternative vegetarian/ vegan diets. I'd highly recommend the Evil Jungle Princess with Tofu and Brown Rice, it's delicious. Good music, good atmosphere, good food, what more could you ask for? By far my favorite Asian restaurant in Scottsdale, I recommend Ling and Louie's to all my friends for dinner group ups."}
{"text":"The food here is great and so is the friendly staff. Ling and Louie's has everything going for it except the feeling of an Asian restaurant as it's a mix of Southwestern influences...Nothing wrong with that..just not plain Asian..  There are a couple of great choices on the menu especially the Evil Jungle Princess and the chicken and rice soup, and some of the appetizers are downright killers sch as the chicken lettuce cups and the chicken skewers. . A word on Houston; the bartender...that guy is bad ass in every sense of  the words...it's just not the same when he is not there...He is cordial, warm, friendly, fuzzy, extremely kind and just a real pro..I can't say enough nice things about him and even the other bartenders there cannot measure up to him...  My first review of Ling and Louie's was a little harsh at first but all my experiences since then have been consistently excellent. The management is top notch and never afraid of any criticism nor to make up for it...  Upgrading my review to four stars because Yay I'm a fan and yes they deserve it..."}
{"text":"I tried Ling and Louie's this weekend on the recommendation of a friend. I'm not a huge fan of Asian food, so I might have been inclined to go with 3 stars, but my boyfriend really liked it, so I went with 4.   The restaurant has a good variety of popular dishes from different Asian cuisines. We ordered:  Pork Pot Stickers... slightly crispy on the outside with a good dipping sauce. Overall, not bad.   Tom Kha Gai soup... coconut based spicy-sweet soup with chicken and mushrooms. The flavor was a little too intense for me. But the bf was a fan.   New Wave Pad Thai... ordered with out chicken. The shrimp was blackened and good. I liked the sauce a lot. I had one serving with some lime squeezed over it and another with chili paste mixed in. Both were good!  Evil Jungle Princess Beef over Jasmine Rice... I didn't really like my first bite, but as I kept going, I started to like it more and more. What a great mix of flavors!!   Limeade... I really liked their limeade. Good compliment to the asian food.   Our waiter was very nice and attentive. Overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I ordered for carry out and the service was dismal.  First off, I was on hold for 5 minutes when the line disconnected.  I called back again, and was on hold for an additional 5 minutes before someone finally answered.  The person who took the order was very slow, as if they did not know how to put the order in their system.  When my husband arrived to pick the order up, there was no one in the restaurant dining, so I wondered why it took so long for someone to pick up the phone in the first place.  Our order consisted of the Long Life Chicken and Rice Soup, Firecracker Chicken, and the Korean Salmon.  Everything was fine, other than the Korean Salmon.  The salmon was overcooked and dry.  We have eaten there before and the food was good, but I really hope they step up on their service for a more consistent result."}
{"text":"The Beijing Chicken Nachos are a meal unto themselves. Light crisp won-tons, ground chikcen and bbq sauce. tangy wasabi sour cream. Delicious.   My review is based on the appetizer the entree was okay could have been more spicy.   I look forward to going back and trying some other items."}
{"text":"Super yummy food!  Between Thai & Asian influences.  Happy hour M-F 3pm-7pm...yay!  Pad Thai is to die for & so is the Seafood Hot Pot!  Drinks aren't too shabby either...Thai Mai frozen drink so good!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Service was a bit spotty. But, the meals were flavorful and good value.  Kung POW wasn't very POW but did have interesting flavors.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Imagine Pei Wei. With crispy spinach. But without the raids by Sheriff Joe and his posse.  You've just been to Ling and Louie's.  Zang."}
{"text":"Well, this is one of those ratings that I wish I could give an extra 1/2 star on, because a 2-star can be deceiving.  This place is very well decorated, and the personality of the servers is very friendly.  The only problem is the food.  I don't really care how good the service is, or how fun the atmosphere is, if a restaurant doesn't have good food, most other categories don't matter.  The Pomegranate tea I had tasted very watered down, and the Firecracker chicken I had (which was highly recommended by the waitress) tasted a lot like a frozen dinner over mildly overdone rice. The sauce was bland, and the chicken was dry and tasteless.  It might pass for somebody unfamiliar with Asian food.  I was pretty surprised, because the shrimp appetizer we had was VERY tasty.  Too bad. I don't expect I'll be back unless my coworkers outnumber me."}
{"text":"Good ambience and good service.  However a bit overpriced for what we got.   And couldn't shake the fact that it was hot where we were seated. For an upscalish restaurant, feeling  hot doesn't sound right."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service!!!  Surf and turf was amazing as well as the wasabi mashed.  We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place may not be the authentic Chinese food that you are looking for but hey.. It's pretty darn delicious. My boyfriend and I came here to dine before the Billy Ocean concert. Our bartender Theresa took immediate care of us knowing that we were pressed for time. She was knowledgeable and helped us pick our tasty dishes. We had the uncles fried rice with shrimp and Mongolian beef with a side of noodles. We haven't been to their Scottsdale location in years but now we are planning to visit it soon with friends to try out new dishes. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Consistently good; love, love the honey walnut shrimp over brown rice (hold mushrooms), yummy."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and we have never had a bad waiter or waitress. Today we have a very nice waitress her name is Jamie.  Awesome job!!!"}
{"text":"I did happy hour here last night and it was not bad. We got the calamari which was very difrent. It had a spicy sauce on it that was pretty good. We also got the lettuce cups which I normally love but did not like this one. And I got a small chicken and rice soup which was good but not Hot. Service was excellent though. Would like to go back and try other items."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here. Let me just say this, the place is fabulous! The food is amazing! And the service is the best I've had in this price range restaurant. PF Changs, eat your heart out!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in for lunch. It was just free they opened so it wasn't very busy. We started with the lettuce wraps a my hubby is a big fan of them at PF Changs. They were pretty good but a little salty for me.  The honey walnut chicken was good. The sauce was different but I really liked it. The fried rice was ok but nothing special.  Overall we had a good experience but the service was pretty slow so I would hate to see what it's like when they are busy. This was our first visit to the casino so I would give the other restaurants a try before returning."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time a couple days ago. Now enjoying for the second time this week. Food is fresh and flavors are delicious! The miso soup is made with  green onion and ample tofu. The spicy tuna rolls are really good, they come with good ginger and I was impressed since this isn't a place specializing in sushi. Evil Jungle Princess is amazing. Kung Pow is also great. I've tried their mignon and chicken, love em both. I tried my friends flatbread and that was pretty tasty too! I've done take out and dined in. Service was spot on. Not too invasive, but very friendly and quick. Will for sure be back and recommend!"}
{"text":"An hour wait when there was no one in the restaurant. Really..... I'll take my money elsewhere and not to the slot machines."}
{"text":"Not so good service... Arrived 8:00 pm and was seated quickly. Then waited 20 min for a server. Appetizer came and was cold. Lettuce wraps were ok, lettuce was wilted as it must have sat under the heat lamp too long. Had to ask for plates napkins and silverware when the appetizer arrived (delivered by different server as our server was no where to be found). After eating our appetizers with menus still in hand waiter finally returns and takes order. Food arrives cold as it probably sat under a heat lamp waiting on a waiter to pick up? Got lucky and got a water and Coke refill when food was delivered. Then waiter disappeared again had to chase him down to get the bill. Food although cold, it was tasty, can't blame the cooks, just poor non-attentive server."}
{"text":"Ok, so it isn't excactly Ling's, it's more Louie's. I would describe it as asian inspired with a healthy twist.  This is hands down my favorite lunch spot. They make amazing food, and at great deals. Not to mention it is so conveinently next door to Golden Spoon yogurt. :)  The only down fall is this total creep that works the bar. Mid 50's, greesey pony tail, dangly earring..total weirdo. He is a space invader for sure. I go through a state of panic each time i go with the thought that I could end up in his section. He is one of those who thinks he is 20-something, attractive and funny. He gets down on his knees (so he is at your level sitting) and just joins the conversation. It is really annoying and almost enough to make me avoid the joint."}
{"text":"A great spot for Happy Hour!  You can't go wrong with their Tai Mai and many other Cocktail specials!  They also have some fun apps to pair with your dinner."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent Ling and Louie's quite often. The food is always great but the service is usually a little below average. The past few times we have visited the service has been exceptionally poor. Last night they were running a seasonal drink special.   It took about ten minutes to get our initial glass of water, which remained empty through out the meal due to the server not attending to us. The server recommended the drinks to us and it took 18 minutes to get the drinks to our table. By this time we already had our food. When the drinks arrived one was biter and we sent it back. The server assured us that it would be taken off the check and apologized.  When they brought out the check (10 minutes after we requested it) it still had the drinks on it. We waited ten more minutes for the server to come back to ask him to take it off. He never did and we paid and left. Needless to say we will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"I've been to this asian fusion resturant a couple of times and I love that they are not your everyday Chinese or Japanese resturant.  They do have your favorite flavors done in new creative ways. The last time I was there I had the Green Chili Curry Macaroni and Cheese off of their limited March Noodle Month Menu.  It was creamy and cheesy with some red pepper and chicken but definitely packed some heat.  It was not something you would find any where else and I highly recommend you try it before it's gone.  My dinner companion had the Tom Kha Gai soup.  It was delicious with a coconut base, green curry with mushroom, chicken, lime and Thai basil. Our waiter was great, very helpful.  We were seated on the patio and started to get a little chilled, so he lit the patio heater right away."}
{"text":"I can make this overpriced food at home!  I feel confident I can open my own restaurant by going to this place.  The food is actually simple yet slightly tasty."}
{"text":"Not your typical Thai joint, this place is higher end and really nice. The menu has a great variety of dishes you would expect to see with some interesting ones that may surprise you.  Happy hour was great with $5 Thai Mais (frozen blended Mai tai, delicious!) and they didn't skimp on the booze! They also had several appetizers to choose from for only $5.   For dinner, I had the Kung Pao, which had excellent flavor and quite a kick, which I loved! Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We ate here last night and really enjoyed it.  We'll be adding Ling and Louie's to our restaurant rotation.  Think of this place as a step up from Pei Wei and you'll be just about right on the money.  We started with the potstickers which were definitely better than what you get at Pei Wei.  My wife had the meat loaf which I tasted - it was excellent.  I had the sizzling chicken and pork which was also quite good.  She had a Mai Thai and I had Kirin Ichiban draft.  Both drinks were great.  Fun atmosphere.  Casual.  We sat next to the kitchen and really enjoyed the smells.  Cons:  The fried rice wasn't anything special, though it was ok.  The brown rice wasn't *good* brown rice - was dry.  Next time I think we'll be happy with the white rice.  If you're sick of the same few places like we are, and you're looking for something a bit nicer than Pei Wei with full wait service, a full bar and better food, this is a great spot.  The prices are a bit more than Pei Wei as well, but not much.  I'm looking forward to going back to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Cool little spot right in a little shopping center with a few other nice restaurants and bars. They do Asian fusion food have some interesting drinks and appetizers. & a good happy hour."}
{"text":"The service was good, the atmosphere was nice and the food was DELISH!  I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Loved the food and the atmosphere. I had the Shrimp and Scallops- my mouth is still watering. Friends had a beef dish and a shrimp and chicken salad with noodles - also delicious. Definitely will go  back"}
{"text":"Don't let the fact that this restaurant is located in a casino deter you!! There is nothing cheesy or \"restaurant casino\" about it! I'm talking primarily about the food. Service is good. Restaurant setting, nice. Seating, plenty. Blah Blah Blah. Anyway! The menu is very creative for Asian food. I love the pepper steak prepared with friend rice, asparugus and mushrooms. We ordered the sampler appetizer with the traditional pot stickers, crab wontons and coconut shrimp. It was delish! The menu is fun and extensive. F'in loaded sliders, the F stands for filet mignon. They have lunch portions which helps since the food is a little pricey. But I am a firm believer in you pay for what you get! This is definitely one of my favorite Chinese places ever!"}
{"text":"Went with friends while at Wild Horse Pass Casino. The food was tasty and inexpensive I had the Honey Walnut Chicken and miso soup and you get good size helping. I only ate a little over half. Everyone in our party enjoyed what they ordered. So if you want Chinese food that's good and not expensive this is a good place to stop."}
{"text":"Great original concept. Wish there were more & closer. Chicken & rice soup to die for. Great happy hr."}
{"text":"Service was great. Server not that knowledgable about drinks but apparently not his fault, they don't allow staff to try the specials so they cannot recommend - boo. Appetizers not that bad and not that special. The sizzling surf & turf and wasabi mashed potatoes were excellent. Signature margarita not that great."}
{"text":"Great for happy hour, but probably would choose somewhere else for dinner next time. Service is great and good atmosphere, but the food was pricey and comparable to a spicy Pei Wei. I didn't have any drinks but a few people in our party did and said they were good."}
{"text":"Calamari is amazing! So is the long life chicken soup! Most the food has a bit of a bite so order with caution. They take reservations but big parties are hard to seat. We had 13 people and the wanted to seat us at two tables. We ended up pulling the tables together and it worked well."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow and rude! About a month ago I went to Ling & Louie's for take out. The order was more than 25 minutes overdue, and when I simply asked how much longer it would be, the bartender said very rudely that it's not her problem.  She never did check on the order, and I got the idea I was being ignored, so after another 25 minutes I simply left. I decided I would give them another chance tonight, so I went in for my pick up order at the time it was supposed to be ready, and it wasn't ready, and I waited another 25 minutes. I asked the bartender how much longer it would be, and she just said I don't know, with no indication she was going to find out. I asked again a few minutes later how much longer it would be, and pointed out I've been waiting for a long time. She said I could talk to the manager if I wanted, with no other solution offered, so I said yes then I'd like to talk to her manager very much. At that point she spent the next 10 minutes waiting on customers and doing one task after another with out informing her manager that I was waiting to speak with him. Unbelievable!!! I finally just walked out again. That's the last time I will walk him to his ridiculously rude restaurant."}
{"text":"Ling & Louie's is quite alright... nothing that leaves me instantly craving a return trip; but good enough that I'm really glad to have tried it.   We started off by trying a couple of their appetizers; the crab wontons and the coconut shrimp. Both were pretty tasty and were served with a sweet and tangy tropical sauce that I quite enjoyed. I do wish that the crab wontons would have been a bit crunchier though. For our main dish we split the \"F'n Sliders\" which were these mini burgers loaded with strips of steak. They weren't too bad, but were pretty messy and hard to eat without feeling like a slob. The best thing we had was probably the Tom Kai Gai soup... slightly spicy but very flavorful. This is the type of place that'd probably work a little better with more of a Pei-Wei's type of set up,,, it has more of a casual, almost bar-like atmosphere... it doesn't feel like you're at an Asian restaurant when you're here.   In the end... it's a cool concept (Asian dishes with more traditional American fusions) it just didn't wow me like it could have. Still it's a solid spot with a fun menu that you should try. 3.5/5."}
{"text":"We are Happy Hour experts . . . and I have to share this place with you.  First of all, Ashley, the bartender, oozed with making you feel like you were \"someone\" sitting at the bar.  Ashley was professional, yet so genuinely kind and informative.  Although she was busy, I would ask her what's this or that, and she took time with me like I was her only customer, all the time, being extremely patient fulfilling all the other orders from patrons and servers.    The happy hour menu is quite the deal in town . . . and so yummy.  Everything they offer is top notch . . . including the Bartender of the Year, Ashley!"}
{"text":"Have you ever swallowed ocean water (by accident)? OMG the food was saltier than that! Be careful! The water is gross. Order some bottled water if you decide to give it a try."}
{"text":"One star for good food and 0.5  for the ambiance .  presentation was really below average for the price .  Our server was really out of sorts , she didnt have an answer to any question on the menu . Drinks suck big time .  We ordered 2 entrees with substitute tofu for meat. When i got the check each of the entree was up charged by $2 .   On asking the server she mentioned this was because I asked for Tofu , which is ridiculous because their menu clearly says any meat can be substituted with tofu and plus the server never told us that the substitution will cost $2 . The main issue here though was the attitude of the server , she never said Sorry for the confusion , instead at first she was trying to kind of rudely justify the charge by saying the computer adds it and her expressions suggested she was very unhappy we asked about the charge. Eventually when I said this was never mentioned  and the menu (where it said tofu may be substituted) she waived the charge and fixed the check but not once did she apologize. All of this and her expressions of just spoiled the whole experience .    A restaurant in such a great casino should have been more customer friendly ."}
{"text":"You can substitute tofu for most of the dishes! Also if you're not a fan of rice as a side they do excellent wokked veggies. My hubby always gets the sizzling seafood platter and loves it."}
{"text":"So so so horrible I will tell you why. I play at the casino all the time and get food comps. So I receive 150 dollars I food comp. I had to order my food at the bar. The young blonde hair lady with the glasses was horrible. First she ignored me and serving her host there was like 4 people at the bar ordering drinks. She didn't even come up and say I'll be with you just a moment, but in stead rolled her eyes at me. Waited 30 mins to finally get to order food. So I place a huge order. Came back serval time to see if my food was ready and she was like the cooks are mad at me and it'll come out. I kept seeing people go by and and getting there food first. Thought that she forgot to put in my order. I went back again to see if it's ready it's been 3hrs. I'm not kidding by the way. They are about to close. I asked for the manager, and waited again. So I played bj and see how it goes. Took the manager 40 mins to see me to resolve issue. So they came up with a plan for the next time I come I have two entree, appetizer, and free dessert on them. I felt that the waitress/ bartender was discriminating and rude. Wow such horrible service. Never been treated like that. So if you see her don't take any orders from her. The food was overall pretty ok."}
{"text":"Ling and Louie's is hanging around a 2.5* for my single visit, but since it was on New Year's Eve, I am bumping them up to 3* because the volume was probably hard for them to handle.  We got a pager when we arrived and we were told it would be a 1.5 hour wait.  It was right about that, but that was fine because we wanted to do a little \"gaming\" first.  We showed up to the restaurant again at about the 1.5 hour mark to see how much longer it would be.  Our pager went off right as we walked in.  Score!  Those hostesses were really accurate.    We were seated in a prompt fashion and our server took our order promptly.  Our appetizers arrived fairly quickly after receiving our drinks.  We had the lettuce wraps and California Roll that were part of a NYE menu.  They were decent, nothing to write home about, but definitely not bad.  Then our waitress disappeared.  We were having great conversation, so we did not notice for awhile.  As our hunger started building, we noticed that people who arrived after we finished our appetizer were being served their meals.    From that point, we started timing to see how long it would take our waitress to appear.  We saw her approach another table, who did not look happy.  Then she returned back to the kitchen and then back to their table.  She finally came to our table after about twenty more minutes and said \"Sorry, food should be out shortly.\"  About twenty five minutes after that, our food was delivered to the table.  We never saw our waitress again.    If we had, we would have told her that one of our dishes, the Surf and Turf, which was supposed to be sliced filet mignon with shrimp, was so tough it was not palatable.  Of course, we didn't see her.  So, the meat was left undisturbed until...  We flagged down another waitress to see if she could get our waitress.  She informed us that our waitress had left.  \"Left?\" we asked.    \"Yes, she had been here since 10 a.m. and was supposed to get off at 8 p.m. so she left.\"  Yeah, she left us and didn't even tell us she was leaving.  She did not even bother bringing us the dessert that was on the special menu we were ordering from.  She just left.  No introduction to a server who would be taking over for her.  She just vanished.  Well, the other server helped us get our dessert (to go, at this point) and she sent over a manager.  The manager was very apologetic (although seemed incredulous of our account of what happened) and comped us for one of our meals without us even asking.  That was an acceptable solution to us, as my Korean salmon with asparagus dish was quite tasty.    Still, I hope this was a one of situation due to an overworked server (who probably should not have taken on any more tables after 8) and not a repeated offense.  It was good enough that I think I would eat here again while at this casino, but not good enough to make it a destination restaurant by any means.    The service of the manager was very good, though.  As soon as he realized there was an issue, he took care of it quickly.  That, my friends, should be recognized.  I appreciate everyone who works on holidays to serve the rest of us.  I think the bad taste  could have been avoided if the server would have just told us she was leaving.  Everyone gets overworked sometimes!"}
{"text":"Newly covered patio area really ups the ante. The food was already up there in the stratosphere. The patio area (we always dine outside, everywhere, unless it is 110+) was previously lovely but too hot, too cold, too sunny, too windy, and now? Just right, says Baby Bear. TVs, heating elements, misters, sun shades, overhead cover, and more integration with the inside and amenable bar area make it perfect for Scottsdale dining near the McDowell Mountain range.   I love great food and so, obviously, do you.  Try the Asian meatloaf and the Big Little Burger in China if you are a carnivore. Awesome main dishes and veg sides no less the mention. Menu also features many dishes for those not so inclined to the meat."}
