{"text":"I have passed this spot hundreds of times but being a creature of habit, I have never stopped to try, opting instead for Fenwick's (Oh! Fenwick's-- must write a review!)which is almost next door.  When I found a coupon in our Citipass book for a free sushi roll, I decided to give it a try.

Unassuming atmosphere, which I appreciate.  Generally, when I dine, I am looking for a food experience, espeically in this price-point.  They have a very limited wine list, and a very limited beer selection, no cocktails!  Which, again, is all fine... who can't enjoy a Tsing Tao?

We ordered a spicy tuna roll, a summer roll (special roll of the evening), and a crunchy roll.  My husband enjoyed all of them.  I, on the other hand, don't love spicy mayo on all of my rolls, so I enjoyed but did not love.  But, for the price, it is definitely worth a try.  I fear I have turned into a sushi snob :(

Our service was fine.

Tip-- Wear a sweater!  It was freezing in there!"}
{"text":"that coupon was bomb. quality sushi. definitely close to as good as anywhere else in charlotte at least."}
{"text":"Had a groupon and decided to check this place out. Ordered the steamed dumplings for appetizers and they were very tasty. A little small for the price I felt, though. Then ordered the schezuan beef, which came with an impressive amount of beef. The sushi rolls were mediocre. I am used to the buy one get one free sushi restaurants in Raleigh so I have trouble paying double what I am used to for sushi and so expect a lot from this pricy sushi.... The only roll I would order again was the roll with sriracha. Atmosphere was pleasant and service was superb."}
{"text":"Worth the trip give it a try and it will amaze your tired old tastebuds. Lunch special is a great deal too!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi and reasonably priced. Teriyaki dish was subpar. Waitress wasn't pleasant. Ok first trip! We will be back for more sushi."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi - we usually get take-out. Love the \"fire island\" roll and \"salmon dream\" roll! Everything tastes very fresh. Great sushi at a decent price.

Remember to grab a take-out menu - it includes coupons!"}
{"text":"There is one place that each of my many and varied friends can agree on for a delicious and relaxing dinner -- Ginbu 401. This little restaurant is meticulously clean (quite possibly the cleanest restrooms in Charlotte) and tastefully decorated. There's nothing pretentious about the place and a person would feel comfortable here dressed for a show or just popping by casually. 

Of the scores of times I've eaten at Ginbu 401, I've never EVER gotten a single bad dish. The sushi is always uber-fresh and the rice/noodle dishes are tasty. My friends who love ginger particularly crave the ginger dressing on their salads; I, on the other hand, relish the miso soup. We ALL agree the crab rangoon are the best in town! 

There is a great selection of appetizers, sushi, hibachi/noodle dishes, etc. on the menu. Everything is very reasonably priced and represents a great value.

When I used to live uptown (for 9 years) I ordered from Ginbu 401 many times and the delivery service was spectacular.

The owner is hard-working, diminutive and delightful lady who clearly takes great pride in her establishment. She is also gifted with being able to discern which servers and cooks to hire . . . everyone here consistently delivers top-notch food and service.

Ginbu 401 is a simply wonderful sushi/asian-fusion spot which I'm glad to say is one of my very favorite go-to spots in the Queen City.

Currently, Ginbu 401 offers a $20 for $10 deal for customers using the Yelp! app."}
{"text":"Great food, everything was so fresh and fast service and very friendly.  We are going back again today."}
{"text":"Oh my gag. This place was such a big disappointment. I've always seen it when I drive by and I finally tried it. When we went inside there were five people standing around behind a counter. We stood there for a minute and a guy looked up and told us we could sit and pointed to the tables. I noticed two tables had not been cleaned. We ordered our food. Everything came out sporadically. I got my salad. The dressing was good. Five minutes later my friend got their soup. A few minutes later I got my egg roll. Tasted like it came from a box. 10 minutes later our food comes out. My broccoli is cold. Not warm, not just under piping hot, it's cold. I ignore it and start eating the sesame tofu. Yuck. The sauce tastes extremely processed and thick. Not good at all. My friend really loved their sushi. And that's what everyone in the reviews who likes Ginbu seems to rave about. My recommendation: don't go there for regular food. You'll be disgusted."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Really nice staff. Let me place a to go order while they were clearly winding down. Seemed happy to do it too, even though the order was a pain.Yelping them seemed the best way to reciprocate. Best Egg Foo Yung in town! Great when looking for steps up from the typical Chinese joint."}
{"text":"Nice staff, good location and ambiance. Sushi is very good and (specially with the yelp deal) very reasonably priced. Great place, definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Ginbu is a great sushi spot in Charlotte. I think it's one of (if not the) best in the city, actually. It's very comparable to Koishi in Cotswold, but this is much more convenient to me and they deliver, so this is definitely a go-to spot. I've dined in for lunch and dinner and gotten delivery/take-out more times than I can count and have never had a bad experience.

My favorite rolls are the spicy tuna, philadelphia and the shrimp tempura, and they have some specialty rolls that are great as well. My husband frequently orders the sweet and sour chicken and teriyaki chicken, which he likes, but I don't think Ginbu's menu has anything too special when it comes to the non-sushi dishes. In fact, I've ordered pad thai a couple of times and each time am slightly disappointed. Charlotte has great thai restaurants, so I think I'll stick to pad thai from another place. 

If you're looking for consistently great (affordable) sushi  I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Instead of going to the cheesecake factory and waiting 2 hours for a table, which I would be waiting for right now, we saw this place and decided to try it out. Definitely worth the detour. Every roll we got in sushi was great and didn't disapoint. Wasabi wasn't as strong as most so had use liberally.

Staff was great and attentive. Service was quick!"}
{"text":"The sushi I had was pretty solid, and they were great at accommodating my allergy to salmon by replacing it with crab.  Service was fast and friendly and all of our food was delicious."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this restaurant after driving by it for months and seeing the very modest appearance.  After hearing rave reviews from many people we finally gave it a try.   It is now my favorite sushi restaurant in the Charlotte area.  We probably dine in or take out there once a week.   The Fire Island sushi is our favorite dish."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's literally ten yards away from me but if I'm too hungover, I know they'll deliver. There is no better sushi restaurant within 50 yards (I don't get out much)."}
{"text":"I stopped in this little sushi joint after visiting a shop nearby to have a late lunch. I would definitely recommend the sushi combo. Mine was with a spicy salmon roll and a giant California roll. The combo also comes with choice of salad or soup. I got the salad considering its way too hot out for soup! It had a tangy ginger dressing and my waitress was attentive, but not bothersome, as can be the case a lot of times. I will try this place again when I'm in the neighborhood. I bet their takeout is good, too."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy place for sushi, prices very reasonable, satisfied my 13 year old picky eater."}
{"text":"Today was our first visit to Ginbu & it's definitely the last. Overall, the food was decent. We ordered 3 rolls of sushi, soup, egg rolls & a beer. The service was astoundingly horrible. We never knew our servers name, she never said thank you, please or even welcome. Forget her even checking up on us to see how we were doing. She took our order, brought the food to our table & gave us our check. When I was observing her behavior towards other people, she was nice & talkative with them. I have no tolerance for bad service & that's what i got at this place."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery. It came fast and was still HOT! The sashimi was a generous portion and good. The Pad Thai was okay but not great. I am a big fan of the hot and sour soup though. It is tastey with lots of mushrooms, egg and tofu. The broth was not thick, which I also liked. The egg rolls are small and at $1.50 I thought they were a little over priced. Overall, if you stick with the sushi and soup, I think you will be pleased. Th service was great and the food was hot."}
{"text":"My dining experience here was probably the worst dining experience I've ever had. Our waitress completely forgot our appetizer and ended up bringing it with our meal. She apologized when she brought it out saying my food was being remade because they added something I didn't ask for. She finally brought my meal out but this time it had tofu in it. Once again the order was wrong she said \"I didn't know you were allergic to tofu\" well guess what?! The menu said NOTHING about tofu being added. Round three, she didn't include the peanuts in my pad Thai which she later brought and sat the dish right in the middle of my food. The check came and she said \"I gave you a 15% discount\"  A whole $1.89 off my bill even with everything being completely wrong. We asked to speak to a manager who wouldn't even listen to our experience, she walked away from our table. This is completely unacceptable. Save your money and go somewhere that is actually decent."}
{"text":"Pat, I notice in your comment that you say all your produce is fresh not frozen.  What about your proteins?  In a previous review comment, it was noted that your scallops were frozen.

Frankly, I'm a little surprised that your only response is that your produce is fresh not frozen.   That response does not encourage me to give your establishment another chance."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday night.  Place was dead.  Most of the tables were dirty, crumbs and whatnot all over them.  Floor was dirty.  Hostess told me to sit wherever I liked by it was hard to find a booth or table that wasn't dirty.  Server walks out with his hand groping the top of my glass of water.  Hold it by the bottom man, not hard to do.  Place smelled funny.  Roll was tiny and the fish was sliced razor thin.  Do yourself a favor and go to Ru San's... worth the wait.  This place is terrible.  This is my second time in in two weeks, no better than the first."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi and reasonably priced! It is no secret to our family and friends that this hidden gem on Providence Road is our favorite sushi joint in Charlotte. 

If you want the best sushi in a nice setting, look no further. The ingredients are always fresh and the flavors are authentic and super tasty. Hands down, Ginbu is fabulous for their lunch deals or dinner out. They always have specials running as well. If you're looking for the best sushi in Charlotte, Ginbu is it!"}
{"text":"Vegan friendly! 
My 'go to' spot for ACA and Sweet Potato rolls!  Staff is pleasant and attentive.  I live in the neighborhood and walk there regularly.  Never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Ginbu for us, has become the fallback for delivery.  The sushi is decent and at times surprisingly really good.  The delivery is prompt, and the people are nice.  It's fits our needs great.  Other than sushi, we have only ever ordered the Pad Thai and house ginger salad, my advice is skip those two.  However, the Hot and Sour  soup and sea weed salad were  much better.  Like I said before, the sushi is always decent, and at times really good.  If your looking for delivery that isn't pizza, Id try Ginbu.  for what it's worth even know I only gave it a three star, we seem to order from here 2-3 times a month so we do really like it."}
{"text":"I used $15 Groupon for $30 worth of food to order teriyaki salmon with vegetables and garlic shrimp with vegetables. The food was good, but the server needs to be more enthusiastic. I get it that we all can have a bad day, but in the restaurant environment it is nice to see a friendly face. Especially, when I told her we will use the Groupon, that seemed to be unpleasant news to her..."}
{"text":"Ginbu 401 used to be great! I do not know what has happened but both the food quality and the customer service have gone down. The past 3 times that I have ordered the food was bland. This is for the broccoli stir-fry dishes and the lo mein. There is definitely way better Chinese food in the city."}
{"text":"Always get the 401 Maki. It's good sushi rolls and you get a lot of food for the price. We've had the same server the past three times and she's pretty inattentive and has a bit of an attitude. The first time we ever went I ordered a Spicy Salmon hand roll. It had tempura flakes in it which made it very soggy by the time I finished my other rolls. I had taken one bite and I simply wasn't appetized by it and asked if it could be removed off our check. Server shrugged and said no, its not their fault. Went there tonight and ordered the spicy scallop ROLL and got...another soggy hand roll. She insisted that's what I said and again, wouldn't correct the mistake. We found out we're in the delivery zone so we probably will be ordering over the phone from now on. Good but definitely has plenty of room for improvement!"}
{"text":"The name of this place had intrigued me every time I drove by until one drizzling, dismal evening months ago. While waiting for a phone call from a lovely young lady I suspected was standing me up, I stumbled through the door overcome by hunger and dead set upon realizing the exotic, lusty and modern experience the name and sign promised.

Immediately crestfallen upon seeing the decor, I draped my wet coat and hat around one of the classroom chairs festooning the cramped sushi bar. Neither the itamae nor any customers were in evidence. A young woman, American, came from the back and in an unplaceable NPR accent asked me which menus I'd like. Clearly lonely and at the end of a long shift, we spoke pleasantly while a proliferation of drinks was paraded before me.

The water tasted .. odd.  Smelling of a mop-bucket after cleaning a gym floor. Tea next, in the saddest, stalest teabag I have ever seen, pitifully leaking its essence into the mop water. Okay, something bottled and stronger? Alas, the sake was lukewarm and unremarkable.

Somewhere amidst the drinks buffet I'd ordered several courses of food, which came out apologetically, ordered as though the unseen and unheard chef was battling eddies in the space-time continuum.  Entree immediately, then sushi, soup, then, finally, a wilted, miserable salad. The rice was dry, the (chicken?) bland, the vegetables wilted. The soup was the mopwater, but warmer, and salted. Presumably someone had come in advance of me, ordered the entire restaurant's supply of 'interesting', 'delicious', and 'tolerable', then with an evil cackle absconded with his culinary trophies.

My waitress apologized about the order, looking contrite but not surprised.

The shining light of that evening-apart from the cordiality of the young lady who kept me company amidst the dust, faded posters, and ancient paneling-was the 'fire island roll'.  This single element of color, flavor, and spice rescued the night from the Raymond Chandler direction it was taking.

I got my phone call, paid my tab, and left, frighteningly sober and still hungry, my head (and stomach) full of naught but unfulfilled promises.

[ed: it's entirely possible the experience above has been colored in some fashion by the passage of time, and too many detective movies.]"}
{"text":"Food is always fabulous. Service can be rough around the edges if it's a busy time. Since it's so close to my office, it's perfect for carry out or dine in, and my sushi is always on point. The Yelp deal is a GREAT deal if you read the fine print!  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Nice little spot for a quiet lunch. I really like the sushi however. Something different i just cant put my finger on. Service is always fast and polite and food comes out quick, the right temperature and tasty! I think dinner would be nice there. I hear the Delivery is fast as well.
Great spot!"}
{"text":"The sushi was ok but the dishes we had were iffy. The chicken tasted chewy and off :("}
{"text":"Went here at 8pm on a Tuesday night.  The food was good and the service was quick and friendly.

Items tried:
1) Pork & vegetable dumplings.  Got them fried vs steamed.  They were great and dipping sauce was delicious.
2) Fire Island Roll w/o the aoili on top.  This was fantastic!  Will definitely order again.
3) Teriyaki beef entree.  Beef was a little dry but overall flavor was great.  Just added some soy sauce and all was well."}
{"text":"Ginbu is our quick, favorite sushi spot. Many times we get it for delivery (though, they only deliver in a 3 mile radius of the restaurant). Before I write this review, I want to preface it by saying that Ginbu isn't some fancy smancy sushi place (like Nikko, Enso, Pisces, Room 112, etc....though, all these places are delish). It is a smaller, low key, and cheaper sushi option. If you are looking for some crazy designed roll, this place may not be the spot for you. 

-Usually, my husband and I get one of the Chinese meals (didn't really care for the terriyaki but the Ginger is great!) and two sushi rolls. We love the spicy tuna roll.....simply tuna and spicy mayo. Very tasty. We also get one of their \"specialty\" rolls like Cherry Blossom, Crunchy, or Star. I absolutely love all of these rolls.
-We have eaten in the restaurant before, however, I have always felt like this place was our go-to for take out sushi/chinese. Thus, we normally get take-out/delivery. They are very quick with both take-out and delivery
-They have great lunch specials......it's like $8 for two rolls and a salad or soup."}
{"text":"First off 1 star is too much, but I have to give a star. Not to be rude like the waitress there. But try avoiding the chubby younger waitress. She's a smart ass, not friendly, and tries to rush you out. The worst part was when she took the tip money while we were still sitting at the table. As we start walking out, she openly complains about the tip. Yes, it was only $1, but that was generous. It was a completely torn dollar, duct taped together that she'd given us as change. We laughed the whole way out the door as she whined to the boss. Very poor quality, small helpings, and over priced. I'm shocked that place is even running and she still works there. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND! Worst sushi bar in town, quality wise"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Ginbu. Their food taste fresh and they have a ton of options. The dishes are huge so you'll definitely have leftovers. I recommend the 401 Spicy, Sweet and Sour, 401 Sesame, any of the sushi rolls, Pad Thai, and the crab wontons."}
{"text":"I love this little place!  Not very big at all but that's okay, there is still plenty of room.  I really enjoyed the sushi.....we had something that was on special (I forgot the name of it now) but it had tempura shrimp in the center surrounded by rice and veggies and topped with eel.  Yum, yum.  It was also about 10 pieces for $9 which is really, really reasonable compared to other local sushi joints.  There was no fishy taste and it was filling and attractive.  I also had some standard veggie only rolls which were nice and fresh, and again really cheap.  My bf and I spent $25 and both left full and satisfied.  We didn't try any of their hot dishes, but there is a good selection of chinese and thai standards as well as appetizers and soup if sushi isn't your thing."}
{"text":"Their sushi is always so good! Except tonight, we ordered delivery tonight everything was fine until I ate the masago nigiri. The minute I put the nigiri in my mouth I was over come with the strongest chemical taste in my mouth. I spit the food out ran straight for the bathroom and proceeded to vomit for 5 minutes. I cannot explain what it was my boy friend ate the other piece of nigiri sushi and it was totally fine. 15 minutes later the same bitter tasting burn is in the back of my throat. I have tried everything at this point to get it out of my mouth and nothing has worked."}
{"text":"I stopped in when I was here for work.....had the hot n sour soup and lunch special of scezuan (sp?) chicken with brown rice....it was good.....not amazing but all was good.  my only critique would be that the stir fry sauce the chicken and veg was tossed in was very heavy...kind of syrupy.....but the flavor was good, really just a texture fail, I would go back."}
{"text":"Quick service, good quality, and inexpensive. I stopped in this place my first night here. The staff was friendly and ready to serve me even though they were closing.

The dinner serving sizes were HUGE and plenty for 2 people. The sushi was yummy too and fresh. They have plenty of options for vegans... with edamame, vegetable sushi rolls, etc. and fairly well priced. 

I ate miso soup and the ACA roll with asparagus, cucumber and avocado. The ACA roll was so crisp and fresh and the miso soup had a lot of seaweed in it so I was happy. They make your sushi order right in front of you, which I like because you know what they are using. Being a germ freak, I was comforted when I saw them wearing gloves and cleaning the surface before and after making each roll.  

I placed an order to-go and it was ready in less than 10 minutes. Oh! And don't forget- make sure to grab a take out menu for coupons!"}
{"text":"Great selection and the quality of the sushi rolls are always good. Can't beat the prices and the staff is very friendly. Love this place!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite chinese restaurants in the city.  Crab Rangoons are awesome.  good coupons on their menu and delivery is fast and reasonable--free if over $15 but i always tip delivery drivers generously."}
{"text":"The best thing about Ginbu 401 is they deliver...literally.  I've both eaten in the restaurant and ordered delivery from them.  Both have been consistent sushi.  Nothing to rave about, but still good if you are wanting some sushi.  The menu has more basic rolls, but a smaller menu with fewer rolls is a good thing."}
{"text":"I am conflicted about this place.  The food is great - love it!  A great lunch sushi menu that gives you plenty of options for a very reasonable price.  And the \"regular\" menu is very customizable.  Pick your desired sauce and cooking style and then pick a protein.  But....(you knew there had to be one, right)...the service is so bad.  I mean, really bad.  The final straw - and the reason I decided to write this review - happened last week.  I walked in (they let you sit anywhere) and said hello to the folks at the counter.  A guy came by with a menu after a minute or two.  Truthfully, I go there often enough that I don't need a menu and could have ordered right then but - he didn't even give me the option, just dropped the menu and kept on walking.  Okay.  No problem....maybe he isn't the server.  But then several minutes ticked by with no one coming to the table.  Two more tables of folks came in....no one waited on them either.  TEN MINUTES later the guy comes back around and asks if I want something to drink.  (I refrained from saying, \"well no....that never occurred to me\"...but it certainly went through my head)  The drink comes but, once again, he dropped it on the table and kept on walking.  Another couple of minutes go by....none of us are being waited on...so I start to get up and then, lo and behold, a server appears.  I give my order, she disappears, and then my miso soup and sushi show up in a fairly timely manner - although my server never said ONE SINGLE WORD to me.  Not \"hello\", not \"sorry for the delay\", not even \"how is your food\".  

So...I will be back but it will NOT be to eat in the restaurant.  They are close enough for me to pick up a take out order and that seems to be my best option.  

If you want good food...go for it!  But I highly advise getting it To-Go!"}
{"text":"Average. Not bad but not great either. Had a sushi craving and it's a few minutes from my house so it was convenient. A bit pricey for the quality of food. I ordered to go over the phone and it took longer than they initially told me. I have been to several different sushi spots in Charlotte and there are far more places you can get better sushi for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Just moved from Mass to Charlotte and decided to try this place out based on the Yelp reviews. I loves the online ordering and payment option it was fast and easy. I would have given them a 5 star if they were able to deliver to my home outside of their 3 mile radius. I live 4 miles away so that was a bummer. 
I loved the Crunchy role....it was worth the price and drive. I also had the spicy tuna role and the crunchy calamari. I didn't find the spicy tuna roll to be anything special but it was still good. And the crunchy calamari was good as well. I loved the spicy dipping sauce. Will def go back."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for sushi last Saturday night, so we decided to give Ginbu a try since we had a coupon.  The outside and inside aren't anything that you'd \"wow\" over.  They've definitely tried to create an Asian atmosphere, but it's not classy or even \"fun\" or lively.  My partner thought the place used to be a bagel joint.  

Our server was fantastic and attentive.  Sure, it was a slow night, but we never had to wait for anything.  

While the regular menu looked pretty extensive, the sushi menu was pretty short.   We ordered several sushi rolls and all were good-sized and VERY delicious.  The only bad thing was that they were priced the same as a fancier sushi place, so I feel that I didn't get the same value.  The others offer atmosphere, so you don't mind paying the price.  Ginbu, unfortunately, doesn't offer any sort of truly \"wowing\" atmosphere, so I feel they should compensate by lowering their prices on the sushi rolls if they want repeat business.  

Food and service = excellent
Atmosphere = average
Pricing = a bit high for the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch!! 2 sushi rolls and a soup or salad is such a great deal :)"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch and what a great deal.  2 rolls and soup or salad for $7.99.  With only a small up charge for more extravagant rolls.

My visit was pretty straight forward as listed above, so this review will not take long.  I didn't even look at the other parts of the menu, I just wanted sushi.  I came in, was seated quickly and the service was great.  The sushi wasn't over the top amazing, but there's only so much you can do with basic rolls.  It was certainly worth the price.

I would assume there is a wait at peak times as this place is pretty small."}
{"text":"Sushi here is ****-ing expensive for the quality.

I mean, if you want quick sushi.  Do it.  

But, buying the nigiri is the equivalent of opening a second mortgage to purchase a double-quarter pounder w/ cheese when you can buy a gourmet burger 3 miles away for $5 (Ru San's).

I award you two stars and may god have mercy on your soul.

(That being said, I'll probably see you next week.  You're just too convenient)."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with my meal, I ordered the General chicken and the Lemon Chicken. The flavor was very good with generous portions, I will definitely go back again. The server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Used the Yelp deal, and two lunch entrees and a sushi roll later we spent about $16 including tip, what a value. I am toying between a 3 and 4 star review but will give this place the benefit of the doubt until I try more dishes. 

The inside is nothing special, a little on the dumpier side with outlet faces dangling out of the ceiling and bugs buzzing around.

I ordered the chicken pad thai ($7.25) and a roll of the fire island (tuna, avocado in tempura style, served /sriracha, masago and scallion $8.25). The service was extremely fast, helpful and attentive.

As I expected, the pad thai was a little sweeter than a traditional thai pad thai and didn't have the peanut sauce based taste. Regardless, it was pretty good and I between the shared sushi and noodles I had plenty of leftovers.

The sushi was decent, was looking for a little more heat from the sriracha as the server indicated the roll should have a little kick to it. Could have used a little more tuna, but overall I was impressed.

Another bonus for this place... they deliver! Minimum is $15 and I believe radius is within 3 miles. Ginbu just might have become my new Sunday night recovery go-to."}
{"text":"Ginbu is my bf's absolute fave sushi spot in town. We found them through Groupon and have been back more times than I can count- probably because the sushi is really good and the restaurant is chill and lowkey. It's just off Providence and super easy to find. The parking lot is kind of small but we've never had an issue finding a spot. Inside is a small takeout counter and a quaint dining area off to the right. We always grab the second from the last booth on the wall. The first waitress we ever had at Ginbu was really pleasant. All the ones we've had since then have been okay- not particularly kind but not rude either. They get our orders right and our drinks filled so we keep coming back. Yesterday we had the Spicy Tuna roll, an eel roll, and wings to start (we def didn't need the wings). The Spicy Tuna was the best roll I've had in a long time. I ordered the teriyaki chicken and he ordered General Tso's. Both were good but I liked his better because it had more sauce. Their teriyaki dish is a bit drier than I prefer, but now I bring my own shrimp sauce since they refuse to carry it. My bf loves this place so I've made the necessary adjustments lol. Definitely try this place. Be sure to get the Groupon!"}
{"text":"Food was even better than expected. What I expected to be a typical sushi dinner turned out to be way more than that. The staff was great and very attentive too! I will definitely be going back there!!!"}
{"text":"I'm new to Charlotte and am trying to get to know restaurants in the area so I bought their Yelp deal. I do NOT recommend this place!  Very poor service, uncomfortable atmosphere, and poor food quality. 

Atmosphere: The AC was blasting and it was freezing inside.  The tables outside were covered in pollen so i had no choice. I asked the waitress 3x to adjust it.  Meanwhile, there was only one other customer in the restaurant and 4 other servers chatting behind the sushi bar. Mine finally came back and said \"the manager knows.\" 

Service: I waited more and then finally asked if I could speak with the manager. From there she just ignored me and told me he would not come out to speak with me. 

Food:  The fish in the sushi was old and poorly presented. Even after all that, the waitress still had the audacity to have an attitude when giving me the bill.  Can you believe it??  

Again...very poor service, uncomfortable atmosphere, and poor food quality. There's no deal worth all that to me (even if the food was free, it's not worth my time).  If I had not bought the Yelp deal ahead of time, I would have walked out."}
{"text":"There spicy tuna roll and Philadelphia are exemplary versions of classics. The fire island was complex, sweet, spicy, and savory. The garlic chicken came out before the sushi and was sweet and spicy. Will be back again and likely will order the spicy tuna and Philadelphia again along with a spicy scallop roll."}
{"text":"Great for takeout or eating in. I've never had to wait for a table. Sushi is fresh and high quality and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"A great place for lunch or dinner.  I've been to Ginbu more than a few times now and the food and service has always been good.

Their lunch prices are quite inexpensive for the amount of food you get .  You have your choice of 6 different sushi lunch specials which all come with 2 different rolls and a salad or miso soup from $7 to $12.  These are no scrawny pieces of sushi either.

They also have a nice selection of chinese dishes that are tasty...if you like lettuce wraps give them a try here.. of course they are not PF Changs but they deserve a mention.

One other thing to mention...I've never had to wait for a table here which is always a big plus...enjoy!"}
{"text":"Regular food and service nothing much to rave about. But it's close to everything and comes out pretty fast!"}
{"text":"I enjoy my experience here at Ginbu 401 everytime! The sushi is great and I love their miso soup.  The spring rolls are light and flaky with crisp vegetables inside.  When I  come with friends we almost always get saki. The only thing that I wasn't impressed with is the calamari. Oh well.  Everything else that I have gotten was great! I even enjoy the decor,  views and location. Great for a business lunch, gathering friends, or a romantic meal."}
{"text":"Was not impressed...

When here recently on a Friday night instead of another spot...mistake....After straining to see the menu in a dark, dull interior, I decided on the sweet and sour chicken.  I don't know if I just ordered the wrong thing, but the sweet and sour sour was not what I was expected at all.  I was pretty much given two separate sauces and encouraged to mix them together.   I'll just say, it wasn't what I expected (or wanted).  The chicken was a little chewy and the peppers were few and far between.  

The service was good, though the atmosphere and overall ambiance were both lacking life.  

There is a fair amount of parking in a well lit lot, and the place is relatively easy to find.  

There's just better Chinese in the area for equal or better prices."}
{"text":"Came in for a lunch today with a friend having heard this place was pretty good and was I ever disappointed.  The only upside of this visit was the Miso Soup.  Everything else was sub par.  The salmon roll was the tiniest roll I've ever had; especially for that price.  The star roll was a sad presentation and unevenly distributed ingredients on the inside.  On top of that, it looked like it had been cut up and just randomly tossed on the plate.  Finally, perhaps the worst part of the experience, the tomago sushi was DISGUSTING, and this is normally one of my favorite types of sushi.  The tomago was still frozen atop the rice.  There is no excuse for this type of laziness!  This is just a sad display of assuming things are \"good enough\" and forgetting about the passion for food.  I will not be recommending this restaurant to any of my friends."}
{"text":"I love this place! My boyfriend isn't a fan though. They are the perfect take-out place and inexpensive. Always enjoyed their sushi, spicy chicken and broccoli, wontons, lettuce wraps and basically everything on the menu. They are also super fast!!"}
{"text":"Ginbu 401 Rocks!
Again... Hand rolls are great.
Pad Thai... Wow! Fresh, clean and light.
This is now my place when in town..."}
{"text":"The sushi was great! However the main entree (schezchun) left something to be desired ... Next time I'll stick with the sushi."}
{"text":"I'm pretty appreciative when I purchase a Groupon for a place that I may not have gone to if it weren't for the discount. I've passed Ginbu many times, but it never convinced me to stop because it didn't look too busy and a bit lonely on that corner. 

My husband and I recently tried it during an off-peak hour. Even though my Groupon said dine-in for dinner, they allowed us to use it early. Cool. Customer service was great! Our server was very friendly and completely attentive! The pacing of getting our food was great. 

We ordered tofu lettuce wraps (not on the menu, but they were happy to accommodate). They were flavorful! Then we ordered a couple sushi rolls: cherry blossom and Philly roll. They were good. The cherry blossom was made with pink soy paper and it made it look really delicate. The last item we ordered was the Kung Pao Tofu...I'd skip it next time. Not too flavorful. We also got some green tea. The pot was pretty, but the handle was secured by scotch tape...I think at that point it's time to retire it. In Asian restaurants, it's a tad disappointing when the green tea isn't loose leaf, but this tea was nice and warm on a chilly day.

Overall, this place was A-OK. You can get good food and excellent service here!"}
{"text":"Best sushi/Chinese food in south Charlotte. They are quick, very well priced, and the food is always incredible. 

The 401 Spicy (chicken) is incredible. Their sushi rolls (Haku roll and crunchy roll are my favorites) are so fresh and we'll made. This is my favorite Oriental restaurant in south Charlotte."}
{"text":"Have come many times. Service getting worse. Never got saki. Dish had tufu when I did not order. Replacement dish had no flavor. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Crab Rangoon was good, but pad Thai was nasty! I couldn't believe it, isn't that one of the easier dishes? It tasted like 10 lemons squeezed onto the noodles. No peanut taste. We dumped it out and it smelled so bad we put it in the trash OUTSIDE. Never again. I could have done a better job and I've never made it before. Waste of money!"}
{"text":"First time we went service was horrible but the food was decent.  Second time we ordered pickup and the food was mediocre. Tonight we tried it again, pick up.  We ordered a couple sushi rolls, egg rolls, dumplings and \"Dan Dan\" noodles.  Let me say right now that this was the absolute WORST Chinese takeout we have EVER had... period.  I'm not exaggerating, I've had some real crappy Chinese in my day, but this, this takes the cake, wins the blue ribbon, etc.  I swear, the Dan Dan noodles taste like a microwaved lean cuisine dish.  I'm not the kind of person to write reviews, but this was so bad I have to make it for public consumption.  We will never go back.  My fiancé made the perfect statement \"we could have eaten Taco Bell and been more satisfied\".  Sad, but completely true.  

Ginbu - get your act together, you aren't the only shop in town.  

For those interested, we have always had good luck and food with Persuasion over off Park in the Dilworth area."}
{"text":"The father -in-law gave us a Half Off Depot certificate for this place.  Since we made a staycation uptown, we headed straight down 3rd street (oh wait now it's Providence Rd) on Saturday evening to Ginbu 401 for dinner.  The place was smaller than I expected and the menu is somewhat limited; though they have a lot of sushi options.  My lo mein was delicious and my wife's sushi was good, as was her ginger salad.  I liked the un-dyed ginger with the sushi.  The service was good.  It seemed everyone in the place had a coupon of some sort.  It may be a little pricey at menu prices for what you get, but the slight discount evens it out.  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Driver don't want deliver food, He sad if you want take you food you must go down stairs and pick up your food, so.... Don't do delivery order please."}
{"text":"So good! They have an awesome sushi selection and usually some special rolls of the week. Today my friend and loved the Salmon Dream roll and the Cherry Blossom. The Cherry Blossom roll was wrapped in pink soybean paper, so it was pretty and pink like the flower. Girly looking, but delicious. 

I've also had the Mixed Veggies with Chicken and it was great. Tons of veggies in a nice light sauce. I think it was a pretty healthy option. 

Look for the $10 for $20 deal on the Yelp app. Eat in only."}
{"text":"if we are home and lazy to drive and feeling asain, well Ginbu 401 is the place to order.  In Grubhub for $1 delivery fee to our area we thought we could give it a try (our first time) but later we ordered just for their food.  Really good Asian food, we usually go with Pad thai, fried rice, veg rolls, and have always loved it. delivery is fast, good is tasting good, decent portions and great pricing."}
{"text":"Consistently good, fresh food. They will steam anything you want and keep the sauce on the side (handy for a diet) and their sushi is decent."}
{"text":"Ginbu is a quaint spot off Providence. The interior is small but nicely decorated. They offer sushi and Chinese dishes. On this visit, we only ordered sushi rolls. Out of the four rolls that we ordered, none were particularly memorable. The fish was fresh but all the rolls were plain. We usually enjoy more innovative/inventive rolls and combinations. If I happen to be close by and in the mood for sushi, I'd stop again but it won't be a go-to spot."}
{"text":"The worst sushi I have everrrrr had. I typically always bring leftovers for lunch but didn't have any so I decided I would go buy lunch. Stopped here to get sushi and was highly disappointed. The girl behind the counter was far from polite. I asked for a side of the pineapple fried rice. She said they don't do that. They only do regular fried rice, so I said ok and just got the \"meal\". Turns out it's literally fried rice with a couple chunks of pineapple... so why couldn't you just ask them to throw the pineapple in there for a side? My lord. As for the sushi I got the Philadelphia roll and spicy tuna. The philly roll was sooo overwhelming gross I literally spit it out. The spicy tuna was so full of the tempura crunch that a hard chunk of it was all I crunched down on through every bite. The menu didn't state it had the tempura in it so I assumed it was just spicy tuna and nothing more. Disgusting. Absolutely will never return. I'll make larger portions for dinner from now on so I'm not stuck eating at a place like this again."}
{"text":"After a few months away, decided to give Ginbu another shot! The owner had called and profusely apologized for the issue I encountered during the last visit. She also put a credit on my takeout account as a thank you. 

Ordered a call in order at 8:45 PM on a Thursday without any issue and mentioned the credit. There was no issue at all redeeming it and the staff upon arrival was very courteous. The food was ready quickly and was delicious - Lemon Flavor chicken and 401 Spicy. Will continue to give them a second chance!"}
{"text":"Chinese and sushi. Service is decent. Food will come fast and hot. It's a small dining area with a sushi bar. I personally love the food but it isn't anything out of the ordinary. Try it! Cost is $7-14 entree."}
{"text":"Staff was nice and greeted me as I came in the door. Sushi is always good. I ate here before, just my first time writing a review. Normally I get my food delivered, last Friday I went there and there was no where to park so I turned around. Today parking was good. The restrooms was not the best, it was clean but smelled really bad. PLEASE NOTE: ON FRIDAYS PARKING IS REALLY BAD"}
{"text":"Quick service! No frills but the food is always so good! The avocado fries and the mei fun are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Just ordered $30 of take-out: a spicy tuna roll (with whole tuna), a salmon dream roll, chicken fried rice and dumplings.  The tuna roll was good.  The salmon roll was a gross consistency with no flavor.  The chicken fried rice was made with a meat that was not the texture or flavor that chicken should be, and the dumplings were flavorless.  We ate the tuna roll.  The rest we had to throw away because it was literally not edible. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I'm not a Fan of most Chinese food except when it is excellent!  Here the Food was better than many Chinese places!  My Dish today was Bean Bean Sauce with Chicken.  The Service was Fantastic and they handled my complaint very Professionally!  I was impressed!  The Interior is very nice looking.  I guess a Modern Asian decor.  My food was good, though no better than three yelp stars and I'm probably not going to review any places that I can not give three stars or better.  

At 1:00 pm lunch on Monday I got the last Parking Space and the last Table!  This place is very popular.  I would probably eat here again except for better choices."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch from here today and I must say, I was impressed with their super quick delivery service.  They quoted me 25 minutes and they made it!  I chose to order from here because I wanted sushi but I also wanted some good ole' chinese food.  I got a sushi roll with crab meat, shrimp tempura, cream cheese and avacado.  It was $8.95 so I was really expecting something special.  It wasn't special.  

The crab rangoons were the best I've had in Charlotte.  The sesame chicken was OK but there was a small bone in one of the pieces.  I lost my appetite after that.  

Both the delivery driver and the person who took my call were very friendly.  I'll probably give them another try in the future but I wasn't blown away on my first run."}
{"text":"In Charlotte for work and found Ginbu 401 as a place that delivers.  I am used to great food coming from the San Francisco Bay Area but when I travel, I lower my standards.  This place was really good and tasted authentic and comparable to the food back home.  The hot and sour soup had quality ingredients and was delivered hot.  Sushi was also very good.  I ordered a spicy tuna roll and a tempura roll.  I always need green tea so I ordered that as well and only expected to get a tea bag and I would boil water in my room.  I received a large size cup of hot water and it was so hot that I needed to give it time to cool down.  (Good thing). I would've have given 5 stars but the food seemed to have MSG.  I don't believe that MSG enhances the taste and my suggestion would not to add this in the food.  A big plus is that included in my order was all the utensils and condiments along with a cup for soy sauce.  Delivery was fast too."}
{"text":"Decided spur of the moment to snag a Groupon for Ginbu and headed over with my fiancée. The Groupon gave you a discount for $30 of food, so we started out with some edamame, which was great. Just the right serving amount to not fill you up, and the flavor was excellent. 

We split five rolls between us and have nothing bad to say about any of them. We got a spicy tuna, a spicy salmon, a Philly, a volcano, and one of the special tools that they were offering. Preparation and presentation were great and the wait staff was very attentive even though they were very busy that evening. 

Also love the location because it is a short note ride from home. Definitely plan to return to Ginbu 401 soon, with or without a Groupon."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here on a Saturday for dinner and will never make that mistake again. We wanted to try a new Chinese place since there aren't any good ones near Uptown and thought we'd give Ginbu a try... now we know to keep on trying elsewhere. 

They forgot an item in our bag, the General Tsos and Chicken Lo Mein both had no flavor at all, the fried rice is hardly fried with nothing mixed in it so basically just white rice and the wonton soup just looked gross. I tried the broth which was ok but the wonton looked nasty, my husband only had a bite. He only had one bite of his egg roll too, which is unheard of, lol!

Basically nothing here has flavor so don't waste your time. The only reason I didn't leave one star was because it didn't taste bad, just didn't taste period."}
{"text":"ATTENTION SOUTHEND RESIDENTS!!!! This places delivers for only $1. The spicy scallop roll and tempura roll as well as the Hot and Sour soup ( extra spicy) was amazing. This is my new sushi spot. The delivery time was spot on and the delivery man was cordial and efficient."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, although it is known for its sushi, I don't eat sushi, but I love there other dishes... One of my favorites is their teriyaki chicken with brown rice or their veggie fried rice with a spring roll. 
Quick great service and great fresh food."}
{"text":"I have to say that when it comes to sushi, Ginbu is very good.  I usually go during their \"lunch special\" hours.  Other than the ginger dressing (I am not a fan of this concept and I wish that every sushi place would simply invest in v/o or some thing else besides ONLY ginger dressing), I really enjoy Ginbu.
A recent renovation has made it a bit more \"chic\" on the inside, leaving me to admire the cosmetic changes.  But the food, quality or otherwise, has not changed and I will continue to frequent.
Also, the service is usually friendly and speedy, even on busy weekend nights.  Thanks Ginbu, I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi..I had the rainbow roll p;us split the Cherry Blossom both were awesome:) Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"As much as I really enjoyed my sushi roll and my service... My entree was just sad. I ordered chicken teriyaki and when it had arrived to the table i was instantly disheartened. The chicken that was supposed to be fresh (you would hope) and made to order, was indeed hard, dry and cracked when you folded it or cut it. I would compare it to a wood chip or a match. I had brought this to my servers attention and he got me started some steak teriyaki instead which was nice of him and very considerate. By the time my remake was arriving to the table, my lunch break was about to be over and I was unable to eat it anyways. Moral of the story: the server was great, the sushi was yummy, the chicken based products... I don't recommend."}
{"text":"Just ordered from Ginbu tonight and was not happy with our experience. The food took over an hour to get here. We got Shrimp Pad Thai which had no flavor and was very dry. The sushi rolls were mushy and did not taste fresh. The crab wontons however were good. For over $50 I expected better quality food."}
{"text":"This is my goto sushi place in Charlotte. Usually order the spicy scallop roll and the spicy salmon roll and it never disappoints. The other dishes are great too, the quality has been consistent and it reminds me of NYC sushi. Would eat here everyday if I could and can't recommend enough!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese I've had in Charlotte. The deliver was a little late and the delivery man was not so friendly, but I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"I'm still looking for the best Chinese restaurant in town. Ginbu's menu looked good, with solid variety, and the lunch prices weren't bad. I placed an order by phone and picked it up about 10-15 minutes later. The food was hot, ready and the check-out was quick and easy.

The egg roll was ok. Nothing fantastic - pretty much your standard Chinese take-out fare, though a bit skimpy on the filling. 

I went for my old standby of cashew chicken. The portion was large, the balance of veggies to chicken was good. Flavor was good... not exciting, but it worked well for the meal. Good mix of veggies - zucchini, carrots, mushrooms, water chesnuts. The chicken was a bit soft and mushy - in chunks as opposed to slices or thin pieces. 

It's a big enough portion and enough flavor that I'd go back again and try some of the other dishes. I'm not a \"fan\" where I'd recommend it right away, but it's good enough that I'll try it again."}
{"text":"Went for Saturday lunch on our first visit because we had a Groupon. The food was really good. Ambiance lacking. Service was only fair despite the restaurant being less than half full."}
{"text":"I had the Star roll and my friend had the Stir-Fry chicken. Both were very good and so was the service. The only thing was that the shrimp sauce was spicy, and I prefer a spice-less shrimp sauce."}
{"text":"Having recently moved to QC, I needed to find my new sushi place! This was the first place I tried and it was so delicious. A few of my favorite rolls are the Ruby, Star, and Spicy Tuna Twist. The Chinese food is also very good as well. I am obsessed with the pineapple chicken fried rice! 

I have never dined in, usually opting for pick up or delivery. The customer service is always very kind and helpful. The food is ready pretty quick, and I've never encountered any issues with Ginbu. I've tried other Chinese take out in the area, but am usually disappointed. From now on, this is always my go to."}
{"text":"Ginbu is fairly simple, cheap and quick Chinese food and sushi. It's a good place for non-sushi-lovers to go, because I can get teriyaki chicken or mongolian beef while my friends order a variety platter of sushi. My boyfriend likes the spicy tuna or salmon hand rolls and the crab tempura maki rolls. 

It's a good place to get takeout. Plus, they deliver."}
{"text":"The sushi was sketchy and made my stomach hurt, and didn't look fresh. The steak sauce was a little bit too sweet and the steak itself wasn't tough enough. The rice noodles were actually pretty good and the chicken fried rice was AWESOME, but the Sanitation is not the best it was a 93. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this restaurant, but you can try if you'd like."}
{"text":"I was a first time customer so I kept it simple. I love their sushi. I had the spicy scallop and spicy tuna roll. They tasted very fresh. The service is great too. Next time I will be more adventurous and they their signature sushi rolls.."}
{"text":"Style. Culture. Taste 

Literally my favorite sushi restaurant in Charlotte. I've been to many and I keep gravitating towards Ginbu 401. The location itself is great, free parking and plenty of space to park your car so you don't have to walk blocks just to eat.

Friendly staff, they know me by name and exactly what I want every time I walk in the door, something I appreciate for sure. 

The sushi is to die for. Busting with flavor, it's innovative and well worth what you pay. I love their lunch special, it's one of the best deals in Charlotte. 

Family owned and ran, it definitely makes it worth your time coming here for your lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"The food was amazing...the service is not so much  hence the 4 stars.  The portions were a good size and they came out hot and fresh.  Best black bean beef entree I've ever had.  The crab wontons were the best too!  I would come back but would hope that the wait staff would be more attentive."}
{"text":"Never gotten to try the food- ordered delivery but we are out of their range (though 10 minutes away)"}
{"text":"Avocado roll is de-lish.  Pad-thai is okay.  Tofu is inedible.

One of the few places that delivers.  Sushi seems like the only thing worth ordering."}
{"text":"Working at Presbyterian I often feel like I lack healthy options for lunch. Sure there is Burger King and Bojangles nearby but I want something fast and nutritious. Sooooo with my Yelp app I checked what was within half of a mile of my office, Ginbu 401 pops up and only a block away! I checked their website and was ecstatic that they have lunch specials. I always get the spicy tuna roll, California roll and salad with ginger sauce. I once got the miso soup but there was way too much for my palate. Ginbu is my go to spot when I want sushi for lunch, I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the sushi here. The service was excellent! They were very knowledgable and offered great suggestions. The sushi was brought out very quick and the prices were very reasonable. We'll be back! I found out about this place on groupon. It was listed as popular and now I know why!"}
{"text":"Gin Bu offers sushi as well as some common Americanized Chinese dishes. The rolls were not creative, but this would be a good place if you like normal rolls made with decent quality fish. I enjoyed my meal here and felt our waitress was obliging."}
{"text":"The edamame was good. This was a solid deal since I used a yelp coupon. Haha

The food was fine and I'd consider going again even though I saw one cockroach but I probably won't since I rather check out other spots if I'm ever back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"It always seems like a happening spot. The parking lot was full however the dining room was empty so I think some of the workers park in the front. The outside looks great! The inside, completely different story. Very dated decor! Our server had a terrible memory, the dish was tasteless. We won't be coming back, or recommending it to friends. I am shocked it's lasted this long."}
{"text":"The food is great, there is a lot of tempura sushi on the menu, which is sort of limiting sushi wise. The service leaves something to  be desired and it does seem a little disorganized in the kitchhen. Overall food great I just wouldn't go on a busy night"}
{"text":"I got takeout from here the other night for two. We had a difficult time initially deciding on what to get from the sushi menu as all the sushi rolls looked great. Had we not just finished a 6-mile run and been exhausted we probably would have taken advantage of the $20 for $10 (dine-in only) special Ginbu is currently running. 

Nonetheless, we elected on a shrimp tempura roll and split a sesame chicken and white rice entree, all around $20, and we were not able to finish the meal. The portion sizes for the price were excellent. 

I am a big fan of sushi and plan on trying more of Ginbu's different selections. We called in and it took about 15 minutes on a Friday night; I call that efficiency. We arrived to pick up our food and were in and out in less than 2 minutes."}
{"text":"Love Ginbu! It's a great casual option when looking for delicious sushi, friendly service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We got a groupon to this place.  They have good food and we got the lettuce wraps and sushi which were all delicious.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars because the server did not seem like she cared me we were there.  I feel like she gave us menus and walked away and took a while before she came back.  Then she would serve food and not come back.  She didn't seem very interested in serving us and it wasn't that busy.  But overall the food was great and hopefully we will have a better experience next time"}
{"text":"We have eaten Ginbu twice recently. The first time was blah so we gave it another chance, well mostly because it is so close to work. But the second time, terrible. I had the pad thai, probably the worst dish I have ever eaten. I didn't even finish my plate, which was already split in half to share with a co-worker. Also, I'm not even sure that was real chicken, it was mushy."}
{"text":"We had the dragon roll, rainbow roll, shrimp tempura roll, and the nigiri yellow tail. Everything was so good. The wasabi was nice and strong. The sliced ginger was good as well. The waitress was very courteous, attentive and professional. The mens bathroom was pretty clean and they had instant hot water. I used a groupon for my first visit and accidentally bought 2, but that is not a problem because it is worth another visit to try some different things on the menu."}
{"text":"Nice service. Take out was packaged well. Good food."}
{"text":"I love love love this awesome blend of Asian cultures. This food is to die for. One of the only places where I can get q Chinese dish with sushi- so cool! The one and only negative is that the fried rice is not really fried- it's just white rice tossed in soy sauce. If they start frying the rice really well, they will be my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my husband and I's go to Chinese restaurant. I love Chinese and my husband loves sushi and we are both satisfied each time. Definitely don't go without their groupon, it's the best deal in the city!"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite sushi places around. The food is wonderful and the whole atmosphere is pretty laid back. I have only had about one entree there so I'm solely a sushi review on food. My only complaints would be on service, the staff always seems bothered you're there and the one time we ordered a sushi platter and the sushi and samishi was delicious, but the portion sizes were terrible. We would have been better off ordering separate rolls and pieces and paying almost the same amount. 

Plus side, there is always a Yelp or Groupon deal"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Thursday around 7pm and it wasn't busy.  So I was worried but let me say this is such a hidden gem.

Started out with some crab rangoons and pot stickers. Both were awesome. Oh ya and some asian beers. Tried the Laughing Buddha or something like that for the first time ever. Tasted like Michalob Ultra if anything. 

For our entrees I ordered my Pad Thai and my boyfriend got a spocy general Taos chicken. He couldnt stop raving about his dish so I had to try a little. It was very spicy which is why he loved it. My phai Thai was a little on the sweet side for me but I tend to like spicy as well.

The service was great, and the prices were unbelievably reasonable. Can't wait to head back and try their sushi."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT for delivery. Always early, friendly and food is good quality. I recommend the wonton soup!"}
{"text":"Since moving to Charlotte, I have had a lot of mediocre Chinese and Asian food in my quest to find a cheap and tasty one.  Stumbling upon Gin Bu 401 is definitely a very happy accident.

My partner and I were on a quest for a new place to eat, and we could not find the place we were looking for.  We were really hungry, and decided to go ahead and stop in here.  Gin Bu looks fairly unassuming from the outside.  We went on a weeknight, and it was not very busy inside.  

For an appetizer, we decided to try the crab wontons, which were pretty delicious.  They were a nice change from a traditional crab rangoon, although not too much different.  My partner ordered the Singapore Rice Noodles, which came in a tasty curry sauce.  He particularly loved that they reminded him of the noodles he used to get in his favorite Chinese restaurant.  The dish was tasty and quite plentiful.  I ordered the Dan Dan noodles, hoping they would be similar to a soba dish.  The noodles were more like udon, but they were also pretty tasty.  

What I really like is that they also deliver.  We called last week and found out they deliver to our home, so I was all over that.  Our delivery took about 50 minutes, but our food was still hot and delicious when it got there.  I was quite impressed.

Their prices are pretty decent for the food they have.  Both times we have eaten there for less than $25 (well, $30 with tip), and both of us had plenty of leftovers.  Service was friendly and efficient, which is always appreciated.

This is definitely my new go-to place to get Chinese dishes.  Maybe one of these days I'll have to try their sushi as well."}
{"text":"Ginbu has great Sushi and dishes in general, also love their lettuce wraps. It's definitely casual and good for take out as well- but I love that it's reasonably priced and they just do a good job overall. I've been here many times and have never had a bad experience, it's one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE the Rock n Roll Roll and Sunflower Roll! both special rolls that aren't on the regular menu. 

The edamame is a must. We're really going to miss Ginbu when we move to Milwaukee!

Many great memories at Ginbu..."}
{"text":"GInbu 401 has become our #1 ordering place for Chinese take-out and Sushi. That's what's great about Ginbu: they have both, and it's pretty good. 

I don't think too highly of Ginbu as an eat-in place, but it's always fairly bustling, so clearly other people think so. I love the dumplings and the Dragon roll on the Japanese side, and the Chicken Kung Pao on the Chinese side of the menu (order it spicy; it lacks flavor otherwise). 

It's not the highest quality sushi fish, but it's good enough, especially for the price. The chinese food isnt anything special, but it's not bad--it's pretty run of the mill. When you order, it comes pretty quickly, which is why it's #1 on our rolodex."}
{"text":"Ginbu is my go-to for sushi delivery and takeout! I've probably ordered from them 20+ times but never actually eaten in the restaurant. They run coupons pretty frequently and I'm a total sucker for a good deal! Everything I've ever ordered has always been tasty and fresh. Looking forward to many nights at home in my PJ's with Ginbu by my side. ;)"}
{"text":"Ginbu is a great choice for dine in or takeout. It's pretty cheap with good quality for the sushi. It's fast and has a casual atmosphere but can be fun for a date night. The staff is usually friendly but at times seems overwhelmed because there is usually only one server. Overall one of my favorite neighborhood spots and a solid sushi place."}
{"text":"I and my gf went there for dinner. The special roll: \"pink panther\" and \"fun of soy\" tasted really delicious!! The servers there were friendly and nice. Strongly recommend!! Must try! Yummiest!!!"}
{"text":"It looks like they've just remodeled or updated because I saw all their furniture out on the sidewalk.  The lunch prices and options are the best because dinner isn't (or hasn't been) the same as lunch.  I tried the Singapore Noodles there and I didn't like them, but it's a nice (fairly close) option for the Myers Park area."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good.  A nice place to dine in or take out.  Parking can be difficult if you get there while they're busy."}
{"text":"Anytime my boyfriend and I order from Ginbu the vegetarian rolls are good, but the salmon sashimi is always icy.  I imagine the other sashimi cuts are still partially frozen as well if the fish is stored the same way.  The last time we ordered the sashimi still has SCALES for god's sake.

But this is the only place that delivers through Eat24 that has good vegetarian sushi options (or any good sushi options it seems) because there are such limited sushi options in Charlotte (no, Asian fusion bistros where cream cheese and chipotle mayo are key components in a roll absolutely do not count) so like, kill me I guess I'll remain a returning customer to this mediocrity."}
{"text":"Mannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn


order take out threw yelp. That was the best/easiest part of this. 

I had the lunch special 2 roll for like $16 an some change . I had the tempura roll and the spider roll. 

Tempura was decent . 

The spider rolll was pure trashhhhhhhhh. super fishy and the crab was cleaned."}
{"text":"We ordered Gin Bu for take-out. We split the sesame chicken with fried rice and chicken lo Mein with an added on egg roll. 

Positives- Really easy ordering, fast-service, the chicken was nice and crisp, the fried rice tasted great though it didn't have any veggies in it (which is a trend for Chinese in this area I've noticed). 

Negative- The lo mein was a little mushy and pretty bland. The majority of it was not eaten. It was also a tad pricier than some of the other Chinese-American take-out spots in the area.

I don't think I was impressed enough to go back though I just might have to take Suzanne S's advice and check out the crab rangoon."}
{"text":"Finding a reasonably priced sushi place in Charlotte with good quality fish is hard.

Ginbu has mastered this!  Their sushi is priced well and they give you a yellow to-go menu that has coupons that you can use for your next visit.  They almost always have a Living Social, Groupon, or Yelp deal.  The best thing about Ginbu is that they deliver for a $1.00 fee plus tip.  

Atmosphere:  The service inside the restaurant can be slow at times, but this doesn't take away from the quality and taste of their food.  We almost always order to-go or delivery because they are accurate and you can use the coupons on these two options.

Order:   We have had almost everything on the menu.  Our sushi favorites are: Cherry Blossom Roll (This is to die for), Spicy Tuna, Avocado Roll, Fire Island Roll.  Both of their soups wonton and egg drop are excellent along with their chicken fried rice.  

Final Thoughts:  We eat here almost once a week and always get take out or delivery."}
{"text":"Service is slow but I can't really blame the server. There were literally 3 servers in the whole restaurant. I got the Lo mein noodles. Good with a smoky flavor. My fiancé got smoke salmon sushi and he said it didn't taste right. He took the salmon out and it was literally black. He stopped a worker that was walking by and asked if it was fresh and she responded by saying yes it was and that the reason why it was that color was because it was smoked. I have never seen smoked salmon look like that before."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing customer service and delivery. Ordered online at 10pm, had the order to me in 20 minutes - fresh and perfect - though it seems they close at 10:30. Unbelievable. I liked them before, but they are more impressive than words!"}
{"text":"It seems like this is a popular sushi place, but since it's also billed as a Chinese restaurant I decided to try some items off of that menu. However, I was extremely disappointed. 

Their version of the classic General Tso's chicken, \"Spicy 401\", was neither spicy nor fried properly. Although the portion size was generous, I couldn't eat any more after a couple of bites. I also tried their Pad Thai, which was utterly flavorless and felt very cobbled together. I wouldn't recommend either dish, or Ginbu as a whole"}
{"text":"We come here for a slice of sushi and a slice of 'American Chinese' food. Driving around with a mad sushi craving is never a good thing, but with the Yelp deal, this place will hit the spot. The rolls aren't madly inventive or the ambience isn't the next Charlotte hot spot either. But. Last time, their version of General Tso's was surprisingly good, but should be expectedly fresh during a slower weeknight. The sushi rolls weren't small either, and I'm perfectly fine with having some good basics without the trendy $10+ rolls where it takes up three line items to describe what it is. 

The service isn't top notch as the servers seem young and/or inexperienced, but I typically don't ask for much else besides the food here."}
{"text":"I was actually a dine in customer. Our server was not only slow but the food c p ming out was slow. It took a full ten minutes for someone to greet us, and another 10 for us to even get our drinks. Soda not cocktails. Had it been takeout or delivery I probably would have had a better review. Regardless the food was just okay."}
{"text":"Food was fine, a little heavy on the sugar in the sauces. Sushi was good and we would definitely order that again. But be prepared for some weird-ass service. 

My review mostly concerns the delivery. The driver who brought our food actually asked for a tip. I indicated during my order that I would tip with cash, which I had ready when the driver arrived. He was quick to point this out before the food had completely changed hands. 

\"You marked that you would tip in cash.\"
\"Yes..\"
\"Well, are you going to tip?\"

Imagine for a moment you're dining in the restaurant. You're hungry. The food finally arrives. Fabulous! Then the server asks if you're going to tip. I mean, have you ever been asked this? The only time this is acceptable is after a haircut or a massage where someone not-the-service-person is asking you because they're the ones ringing you up. And even then, they are never pushy about it. 

I tip as a rule because it's what one should do, but the staff at this place should be reminded that gratuity is optional and is in general awarded based on quality of service."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Bought a groupon so got a good deal. We tried a spicy tuna roll, Ruby roll, fire island, and a crunchy roll and they were all amazing! The service was also great, super friendly and food came out quickly! Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Can't speak for any dishes but the Teriyaki chicken and \"spicy\" chicken. The teriyaki was dry grilled chicken with teriyaki sauce on the side rather than grilled in teriyaki sauce. Rather disappointing, especially because they don't carry shrimp sauce.
The spicy chicken wasn't even the slightest bit spicy, and I'm not someone that can handle really spicy food."}
{"text":"My cousin and I bought a groupon to eat here.  WELL WORTH IT.
When I'm in Charlotte I'll come back
1. We ordered a lot of sushi. It was fresh and came out surprisingly fast
2. I had iced tea- they refilled it plenty
3. We both ordered miso soup- this was some good miso- it had some nice extra mushrooms or something in it.

Definitely coming back.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"First off, waitress was excellent.  Very good service.  Went above and beyond for a special request.  

We ordered a star roll, crunchy roll and California roll.  All rolls were excellent and had great flavor.  

We also ordered seaweed salad.  I'm picky about this.  I will not eat the neon green seaweed.  Asked the waitress if theirs was neon, she went a step further and brought a sample for me.  It was excellent.  

The edamame was lightly salted and hot.  

The wonton and miso soup wet both excellent. 

And forget the fortune cookies.   A nice ending to a great lunch.  

Everything came out quickly and hot.  Will return!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place. The menu has a great variety and the portions are huge. I generally chose the Chinese selections from the menu (sesame chicken, fried rice) both are delicious. The sushi is also quite good. A solid choice! We have yet to be disappointed when we've eaten here."}
{"text":"I had the luck of working in Charlotte twice this week (sarcasm) and treated myself to lunch while I was down there.  I wanted to try Ginbu because of all the rave reviews on Yelp.  I ordered the California roll for my appetizer and the Cashew Chicken for my lunch.  It was good, but not great.  Definitely have had better.  I will say the sushi was fresh which is always a plus.  The Cashew Chicken was nothing special so I was a tad disappointed after reading all the 5 star reviews.  My service was prompt and friendly-ish.  I definitely was not wooed or chatted up, but it wasn't bad service either.  I was in and out in about 40 minutes.  Pretty much a very strong 3 star experience from beginning to end.  I might go again, but I would probably opt for Deejai down the street."}
{"text":"I always get carry out here and it is very good.  The service is pretty quick.  Everything I've ever gotten was good. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Free, quick delivery, friendly staff, and decent faux-Chinese flavors. Everyone needs a delivery stir-fry place in their lives, and this has become ours.

I've only had one piece of sushi here - the ACA handroll. It was surprisingly good, and the presentation was sweet. Lightly battered asparagus, matchstick cukes, smidge of avocado. Tightly rolled, surrounded by a hoisin reduction. Tasty!

Eating in here is pretty enjoyable - super-friendly staff, comfy fusion decor, but the booth backs are loose as hell so you're going to be doing the push-me-pull-you with whoever's behind ya. Sigh.

They're angels about subbing stuff, so I've given several of their noodle dishes a go - had high hopes for the Singapore noodles, but it's a dry spice curry mix they're using, so it's pretty meh. Garlic sauce is pretty bland. But veggies are various and fresh, rice is of good quality, prices are reasonable (most veg entrees run 9 bucks) and like I said - delivery is quick. So for those lazy stir-fry craving nights, give them a whirl."}
{"text":"Randomly checked this place out as a pre-workout snack.  Prob the worst sushi I've had in Charlotte, but at least it was cheap ($7.99 lunch special for two basic rolls).  Now granted, I didn't get any of their specialty rolls - but it was the fish that didn't taste that good.  It didn't look that good either (I sat at the sushi bar).

Now don't get me wrong, this place wasn't terrible or nasty - but I won't go back."}
{"text":"Good sushi at a fair price. Quality can be inconsistent with takeout/delivery sometimes.
Try the Cherry Blossom or one of their other unique rolls."}
{"text":"I would have given this one star for my experience however the food is typically pretty good. We went on a Friday night for our weekly dateNight. It was 930 when we walked in an hour before they close, and since we already knew what we wanted we went ahead and ordered. We ordered an appetizer, two sushi rolls and a shared entrée..The food came incredibly quick all at the same. We have never felt so rushed to eat our meal. The waitress was too busy cleaning the floors and bathroom to even give us a refill. She brought us the check 15 minutes after we had sat down. Mind you we never asked for the check. My fiancé still had a full entree to eat and she is practically pushing us out the door! We ended up just putting our whole entree in a to go container. We paid for our meal and the waitress had the audacity to tell my fiancé that he couldn't use the bathroom because she had already cleaned it. It was barely after 10:00 at this point...If your goal was to piss someone off to the point that they will never come back again, mission accomplished! You just lost two regulars and many more to whomever heeds my advice.."}
{"text":"This just became my new favorite sushi restaurant in Charlotte. Purchased the yelp deal on my way to the restaurant. Seaweed salad was a bit overdressed for my liking but still good. Dumplings and sushi were both excellent as well as the service (was on of only 4 tables on a Monday night). Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Ginbu twice before and never really had a problem but this past Saturday when my friends and I decided to go for lunch is a whole different story.. 

I always order the pineapple chicken fried rice because I know I can't go wrong with that so that's the only thing worth giving two stars for. 

Sushi was okay (if that).. Presentation is plain (no effort at all put into it) and def didn't taste fresh. You can get better sushi at Harris Teeter.

The meat in the beef teriyaki was mushy and had strange texture to it.. My friend had to ask if they could cook it some more but came back out the same. 

As for service.. Our server wasn't very attentive. Seeing as there was only two other tables, we could've used a little more attention. Now for the lady at the register when we were paying for our bills.. We were NOT pleased with the attitude we were given. Our friend sent back a full plate of food because her chicken was dry and it just wasn't good so she did not feel obligated to have to pay ANYTHING for something she barely took one bite out of. So after that friend refused to pay for that (she did pay for the other item she ordered), this lady decides to catch an attitude while my sister pays, slams the register and doesn't even ask if everything was okay or greet us out the door. I'm sorry but if you have one bad experience with one person in the party, don't take it out on the others. We did nothing wrong and I feel that it was absolutely disrespectful and rude for us to be treated like that. What a shame. 

After this experience at Ginbu, I'm not sure if I would come back unless I'm forced to."}
{"text":"It was a food experience overall, I visited during lunch.  The lunch deals were pretty good, two basic rolls for $7.99 and two more specialty rolls for $16.99, one of each for $12.99.  The sushi was good, I got an appetizer as well, crab wontons! Yummy.  The atmosphere was quaint and quiet, the server was nice as well, I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Fast. Food was great. Service was ok. She was a little upset that the last table hadn't tipped. We made sure to give her extra. Sushi was great! Tea was a bit bitter. The $20 for $10 coupon was worth it."}
{"text":"I am a regular at this establishment.  The sushi rocks!  The price is fair and the service is fine.  The atmosphere is okay.  The \"Spicy Tuna Twist\" is my usual and it is very yummy!"}
{"text":"Great place. Saw it on the side of the road a said what the hell. Best accidental discovery ever!"}
{"text":"As long as you know what you are getting into this place is alright. Had a Groupon for this place and decided to order sushi. Americanized sushi of average quality to say the least, but good enough to hit the spot when you have a craving, but a limited budget. 

The place is super small with maybe 10-15 tables, so keep that in mind if you are going on the weekend. They also serve Chinese food, but I would assume that similar to the sushi it is very Americanized in terms of flavor/preparation."}
{"text":"Ginbu is a neighborhood place for me that I like to walk to. It's really a 3.5 IMHO BUT the food is decent and I love taking my daughter there. She loves ordering the LoMein and the seaweed salad. Everything is reasonably priced and there is always a Groupon/Deal. Can't really go wrong. Ambiance is not good, restaurant is small, things go fast. Service is just - ok.  This isn't a big date or hang out place, but a good meal. I've tried a bunch of the sushi and other menu items and it's always good. Recommend!"}
{"text":"unimpressed. it was obvious that the staff was trying to do a good job, but sadly my overall experience was less than mediocre.
While the folks there were friendly, they were really not attentive towards simple things like making sure we had plates, silver ware or chopsticks once the food arrived. We tried a variety of dishes.. started with a hot and sour soup which was okay, a house salad which was okay too. The chicken lettuce wraps were good until a couple minutes in to eating it I thought there was a strange smell in the food. We also had the tuna tataki (which is an appetizer and came to the table after we finished our main course), but it wasn't bad. For the main course I ordered the sa-cha chicken, and while the flavor was alright there were a couple things that really bothered me
i) the vegetables in the dish were cold - not even slightly warm, they were cold.  
ii) there were pieces of beef in my dish. That would not have been cool, if I was a strict non beef eater.

It's just small things like this which add up, and ruin a customer's experience and impression of a restaurant, thus putting the restaurant on their \"probably won't go back there\" list. But given that there were so many other folks who seem to have enjoyed the food there, I may give it another try, and get take out this time."}
{"text":"Dined in and ordered delivery from ginbu, it has been a positive experience in terms of quality of food and service. I'm usually hesitant to try places that feature multiple cuisines out of fear that they're doing many things poorly instead of a few things well. They've exceeded my expectations and done a solid to outstanding job on various items.
Specifically I've searched Charlotte for good hot and sour soup and good veggie pad thai--things that are harder to find here than one would expect--and ginbu delivered. Went there for sushi also, found they did a solid job and it was a good value."}
{"text":"I have dined in as well as carried out from this location many times. The food is always fresh, hot and the portions are huge for the price. The inside is small but I have never waited for a table, service has been consistently good. I always eat the chicken pad thai, its loaded with chicken... the eggs rolls are crispy and not greasy, my BF always tries something new and has really enjoyed what hes gotten. This last visit we took friends who love sushi and they were super impressed. Its one of the better chinese places around charlotte, you can tell they use quality ingredients and take pride in what they are serving."}
{"text":"I really hate to do this, but after over 5 recent visits, my feelings toward Ginbu 401 has faded and I think I will move on.  Ginbu is not too far my office and also delivers to my home, only a few miles away so I have taken advantage of both, restaurant visits and delivery.
I have typically ordered sushi, which I feel has gone downhill. The sashimi slices seem to have shrunk over the years and aren't the best pieces of fish I have seen/had. And, I don't really feel like they offer a good varirty of rolls, almost everyone includes a fried item or cream cheese.
However, being disappointed with the sushi I decided to check out their chinese dishes and ordered the Sechuan (spelling??) chicken and UGH is all I will say!!! The chicken tasted like frozen chicken and I ended up spitting have of every bite out because it tasted so bad. I resolved to eating the bland white rice they sent and the veggies out of the dish which weren't that great either.  I won't make that mistake again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been coming here for years. They are prompt and accurate with dine in and take out. They are accommodating to my 11-year-olds picky eating needs. Food is great. Always friendly good service."}
{"text":"After more than 50 (rough estimate!) take out lunches from here over the past couple of years, husband and I finally made it for a proper restaurant meal. The sushi was fresh and delicious and the noodles and veggie dishes we split were great too. Service was fast, ambiance was nice and overall it was a very enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"My fiance and I just moved to the Elizabeth area and were looking for a good sushi place near our new neighborhood. Seeing the Ginbu was offering a groupon, we decided to buy it... I mean, what have you really got to lose.

We have since been back to Ginbu 3 or 4 times. They have great, fresh sushi and the service is quick. I love that we can get good food and be in and out. Ginbu is a small restaurant with a tight parking lot, so be prepared to park on the street if they're busy.

Their prices are very reasonable compared to other sushi establishments in Charlotte. I have not tried anything off the menu other than sushi and salad. I am a big fan of ginger dressing, but I must admit that Ginbu's ginger was not my favorite. It was a little creamier than I was expecting, but I would order the salad again.

I have seen a lot of reviews about the less-than-awesome service. I've never had bad service there; I've also never had outstanding service. It's just kind of meh, which is surprising for a smaller, more intimate setting. Nonetheless, I will continue to go to Ginbu because it's delicious and conveniently located."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Friday night around 7pm for dinner. Parking spaces were tight and very limited (but I guess that's the norm for this area of Charlotte). Once inside, it took a few minutes before someone acknowledged our presence and then instructed us to seat ourselves at any available table. The worst part of our dining experience at Ginbu was our waitress. Her name escapes me now, but she was a short, chubby Asian girl with glasses. She plopped the menus down on the table and scurried away without asking if we cared for something to drink while looking over the menu.  After about 5 minutes or so, the waitress returned to get our orders. We ordered the Crunchy Roll and two other maki rolls, all of which were decent, but not memorable. Another person in our group ordered the General Tso chicken. The portion was plentiful, but the chicken itself was overly sweet. Our waitress was MIA for most of the meal. We had to flag down other staff members to refill our drinks. Not once during our dinner did she smile at us or displayed any warmth. Service with a smile is definitely not something they practice at Ginbu 401. 

The whole experience with Ginbu 401 (parking, awkwardly seating ourselves, the poor lighting, and the unwelcoming waitstaff) was very unpleasant. I am unimpressed with this restaurant and doubt I would return in the future. My recommendation to Ginbu is to hire better wait staffs and train them on the importance of being friendly and courteous to customers."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab sushi to go or eat in a relaxing environment at the restaurant. It's casual and they have very inexpensive and good sushi rolls. 

I got the miso soup and the Fire Island Roll. Both were good, nothing crazy. 

I would go back to this restaurant and trust it as a \"to go sushi\" spot."}
{"text":"Great and friendly service is what you will find here. Oh, and did I mention fantastic sushi! It's a perfect place to meet some friends, and order a few different dishes to share. Sushi is fresh, made to order. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a very clean restaurant restaurant located in a great treed neighborhood near a concentration of medical facilities & doctor offices.  The service during my lunchtime visit was efficient, professional and polite.  The sushi was nice-- not fantastic but not bad either.  The seaweed salad was fresh but the dressing seemed a little lacking in flavor.  The fish was moderately fresh but the rice in my nigiri sushi could of been more sticky to better hold up to the dip in the soy sauce.  This place was nice.  I'd need to visit more to see if they can earn more than the three stars I gave it.  But really, I think my rating is fair."}
{"text":"Volcano roll delivery. This is NOT satisfactory. Why spend extra $$ to deliver when you get this?!!"}
{"text":"I am not impressed. I went tonight with my daughter. The food was mediocre as well as the service. We told the waitress to give us a minute to look over the menu and she sat at the bar over 10 minutes on her phone without looking back to see if we were ready. She finally got up when new customers came in. When she brought the food, I could not even ask for anything more before she walked off. She came back when our food was almost done. The staff was just not welcoming or friendly at all at this little place.The food was also just ok including the sushi. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love ginbu for the apps. Chicken wings, crab wontons, and dumplings. Poppin. The entrees on the other hand. Hit or miss honestly. Sushi I would give 3.5 stars. 2 stars for the entrees. 4.5 for apps. Volcano salad is also awesome ."}
