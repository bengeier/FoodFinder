{"text":"It's \"you order we serve\" at this popular Japanese style kiosk that operates a location next to Swiss Chalet and A&W at the Calgary International airport (Level 2 above domestic departures food court).

You can't go wrong with the food, they are slightly overpriced and very skimpy on the protein even when ordering and paying extra for double meat. The vegetables that are saut√©ed are mostly cabbage with a hint, a very small hint of broccoli and carrots so not much nutritional value there for what you pay ($8.25 for a basic skimpy portion, add $3 for a hint more meat and cabbage).

Service is curt and to the point.  Despite it all; it is one of the Healthy options in the food court if you skip the rice and the sweet sauce they lather everything in when they plate your order."}

{"text":"Only issue when taking a 1:40 pm plane is that you have to skip lunch at noon and start heading to the airport. We showed up at the airport at 12:30 and were hungry so we went upstairs before security check and saw Edo Japan. It was interesting how they have poke bowl and not just the teriyaki stuff. So I wanted a poke bowl but we had a hard time understanding what the staff were saying. I thought they only have cooked stuff because the featured poke bowl was California and Tempura poke. that doesn't sound appetizing at all. I mean I like poke with raw fish. 

So then they told me they had couple options and looked up at the menu and have to say it was a bit confusing to read. 

At the end, I realized they have raw salmon poke and so I got that with poke sauce. Overall, it was not bad. Only fall back is that until the very end things started to taste very salty. The sauce were all at the bottom and only until the end it doesn't taste so good. The beginning was delicious. Flavor not too consistent. 

There is not a lot of fish though. 

But this is at the airport and so I don't expect too much."}
