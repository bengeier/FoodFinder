{"text":"This is great sushi!! Their happy hour is also incredible you can get a lot of sushi for not a lot of money. The Las Vegas roll was fantastic."}
{"text":"We loved it here! They have all the things we love: Pictures of the rolls on the menu, which makes for easy decision making A great happy hour And MNF was on (my husband loved that part)  We ordered the avocado rolls, but couldn't choose between avocado rolls or jalepeno, so Sean made us half and half:) they were delish.  Our food came with a miso and salad. Such a nice extra!  We also had a smokey philly, a Nevada roll, and a volcano. All very very good, but the Volcano was probably our favorite one.   Best part of the meal was when we got the check, and saw what a great deal we got on all that food.   Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"So I decided to try Four Seasons since a friend recommended me. We typically have our local favorite, but decided to give it a try. We walked in and the the staff was friendly, but it was empty. We sat down and there was just an off smell. The sushi pictures from the menu looked great so we order a few rolls (Strawberry, Golden C.A., and Caterpillar Rolls) as well as the edamame, beef yakisoba, and soup. The soup was way to salty and was lukewarm and the edamame was hard and definitely didn't taste fresh. I figured okay well we really came for the Sushi so we'll see how that is. The rolls came out on a big boat type dish (presented very nicely) which got me excited. Unfortunately the taste did not match the expectations from the presentation. The rolls were not good. They didn't taste fresh nor look like anything from the picture. We ended up leaving a roll and a half left, as well as the whole plate of yakisoba. I don't know if they were just having an off night, but I would not recommend them."}
{"text":"Sushi here is awesome!  Some of the freshest I've had, I tried the surf clam and it was delicious. Sometimes the servers can be a bit slow, but the quality of the sushi makes up for it."}
{"text":"I moved here a year ago and I wasn't sure if good sushi could be found in the desert, but it is. I have been to Four Seasons Sushi several times with my family (which includes a toddler in a high chair) and the service is always friendly and timely. The sushi is good and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I've come here for lunch a few times, mostly out of convenience, but this place is pretty decent for the value/price. Every time I've been here, I've always gotten the Lunch Combo E: Spicy tuna roll (8 pc) and Spicy yellow tail roll (8 pc) for approx $7.50 with tax. So far, I have not been disappointed, but then again, these are some pretty hard rolls to mess up."}
{"text":"We LOVED this place, and we are very picky about our sushi restaurants. All of our food came out in a timely manner and everything we ordered was amazing! We went during happy hour so the pricing wasn't terrible either. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great place for good cost Sushi! They make it a great value with their always \"happy hour\" prices - the quality of Sushi (despite being concerned about how inexpensive) was amazing!  Additionally, they provide the soup and salad at no additional cost.  Make sure and ask about the special rolls that are not on the menu - for example, the Medusa roll is amazing!  The staff is always very friendly and treats you like one of their family - it is great to go to a restaurant where they really seem to enjoy their patrons!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years.  Great service.  We showed up tonight 5 minutes after close and they still served us.  Great place."}
{"text":"I've been a sushi addict for the past 3 years and have driven throughout the valley to find quality sushi.  What a surprise that this little sushi joint tucked into a strip mall has the best sushi in the southeast part of the valley.  I usually eat here a couple fo times a week and have never been disappointed.  The sushi and sashimi are always fresh and artfully prepared.  They have a large selection of rolls not found elsewhere.  They are always adding new rolls as well.  It doesn't quite have the vibe of Blue Wasabi or RA, but the sushi is so much better.  The prices are very reasonable, cheaper than RA or Wasabi.  The staff is friendly.  They have a good selection of beers and saki.  They have some great Happy Hour specials."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place. Anytime we want good sushi and not spend so much we go here. The only thing I can say is that the service is very inconsistent. Sometimes we get great service, others its not so great. They change their menu a lot, but their rolls stay pretty much the same. Every time we go in we think they must have changed owners because something always has changed.   I would highly recommend for some good sushi!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi spot in Gilbert. We have been coming here for 7 years now and they are always amazing. Great sushi and excellent service every single time."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I didn't really like sushi till i ate here.  They brother runs sushi 101 in tempe but this place is sooo much better. I like that it is nice and small.  They have great lunch specials and also happy hour specials.  I recommend you try the red rock roll and also the lady bug roll...but pretty much everything is good."}
{"text":"My husband took me here a couple years ago & since then we've taken our family & friends here! The sushi is amazing. There's an option for the \"boat.\" It's literally a boat with a variety of sushi."}
{"text":"The bomb! Literal sake bombs are amazing and the staff is awesome great customer service"}
{"text":"Great sushi at a great price. Our family has been going to Four Seasons for many years. They did a complete remodel a few years ago, creating additional seating and a new sushi bar. The food is always quick and awesome. Our favorites are the Sakura roll, Santa Fe roll and Las Vegas roll, among many others. Happy hour pricing is very low, with several 8 piece rolls starting at $5. They do take reservations though we've never had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Great sushi,  it looks pretty small on the outside,  but on the inside its really nice. They had really fresh fish, and they prepared it great.  I would definitely recommend them to friends and I'll be coming back myself."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The interior isn't anything to brag about but the sushi is exceptional. I love the strawberry and cherry blossom rolls!"}
{"text":"Been here 4 times and 3 of the 4 they screwed up the order so bad that half of us got food and the other half had to wait nearly 20 minutes for their food (Awkward). This time is the last time I'll go here. Me and my 5 year old walked all the way up there, I ordered sushi and my kid got the teriyaki rice bowl. Me and the woman had a long discussion on this teriyaki bowl as to what all comes in it. So we get our order and walk all the way home to discover the teriyaki bowl was missing. We walk all the way back up there and the lady says \"sorry, it will be a few minutes\". Eventually she brings the food as says \"sorry about that and that it's her fault that she forgot it\". Then tells me I owe her 8 bucks, I said you should discount it or give it to me for free for making us walk back and forth. She said No, but that she was sorry.  I would have told her to stick up her pants but my kid was hungry so I paid it but never again will I come here."}
{"text":"This has been my go to place for a while. Good prices and good rolls. I bring my kiddos and always order teriyaki chicken, the past couple times it comes out pretty quick and doesn't look too fresh it comes with a macaroni salad which doesn't go with the Asian vibe and it is definetely from a container.  There bathroom area smells kinda weird like something is leaking."}
{"text":"Great sushi and good quality. I haven't had a questionable piece of fish here and I've been quite a few times. They have some interesting rolls here too, plenty for the folks not so fond of sushi as well. Great miso soup that comes with sushi on the house.  They offer to go so you can pickup an order which is nice. Staff is always friendly, never have any issues. Price is great, my fiance and I haven't ever spent more than $40 and that's including alcohol on occasion. Quickly became my favorite sushi spot."}
{"text":"I'm a huge sushi lover and I was excited to find this place close to where I live. We came to eat as a family after I got a new job to celebrate and we so were disappointed...  1. It smelled like someone took the biggest dump in the bathroom and clogged it.  It was disgusting... I gagged a lot and did my best to keep composure. 2. Sushi rolls didn't even get made firmly... it was loose and falling apart. 3. Flavor... was bland  4. Waitress looked super annoyed with us... made us feel uncomfortable 5. Bowls/plates looked grimy   I would never step foot in here at all.  Sad because it isn't a chain restaurant... and looked like the owners were inside working/eating... but didn't care enough to take care of things."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I usually order online and after the 10th time I ordered online, I got my order free! Every time when I go in to pick it up, food is ready and I'm in and out in less than 1 min! Sushi quality is fresh and good. They also have speciality rolls that are to die for. Love this place. Workers are always friendly and polite!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour with affordable drinks, appetizers and sushi.  We had the Angel Crab Puffs to start, great flavor, and the Golden CA Roll and Shrimp Lover Roll were the best."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi in the east valley! ...I'm from Southern California and Hawaii... I know good sushi and this is stuff that I would expect from home!   Cheap, fast and incredibly tasty!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE... in fact, my mouth is watering just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin. Bathroom dirty, service ok, and although tasty, disappointedly small portions for the money.  The sashimi was cut so thinly, that three pieces put together would have made one slice in other sushi places around town. Don't think I'll be back again."}
{"text":"This place has been a favorite of mine for years, great prices and have never been disappointed! It's also nice they give you miso soup  and a little salad too! Owner and staff is always friendly, much rather support a place like this than Ra, Kona, or Kabuki"}
{"text":"Great specials and high quality sushi! Definitely will be coming back! The staff is polite and attentive. Quick service for your lunch break."}
{"text":"This joint offers good sushi for a good price.  Ya'll, you get what you pay for.  I recommend the sushi rolls, not a sashimi fan here."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi! Great prices and outstanding service!! Great way to spend a Sunday! We shared the love boat. And for $22 it was so much food!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm very surprised this place is rated so highly. The food was highly unimpressive. I ordered the Teriyaki chicken and it tasted like they took pre-sliced refrigerated chicken and poured store bought teriyaki sauce on it. I gave 2 stars because the customer service was great. Skip this place and go anywhere else. I would even choose Panda Express over going to this place again."}
{"text":"Not so good; gave this place a shot for their $5 lunch special- and the fact that they have macaroni salad, which is a staple for teriyaki food back home. The teriyaki chicken was very bland, and I question the cleanliness of the restaurant too."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite \"hole in the wall\" places to eat. The prices are great and the sushi is always fresh. They also have some pretty decent appetizers.  The Lemon Roll is very refreshing and you really can't go wrong with their lobster roll either. The only roll I haven't liked is the southwest roll and only because it was so spicy I couldn't enjoy it."}
{"text":"Best japanese food in Pheonix & amazing prices! Excellent staff."}
{"text":"Meh. The food was uninspiring. Maybe because it was later that I went, but it seemed like they didn't give as much F. when preparing sushi.   The sushi bar was dirty. Close to the bus boy station. Smelly and gross.  The decor was cozy and the people were friendly, however."}
{"text":"Great sushi at great prices! But above that what stands out most to me is the incredible staff.  Joe was a great server couldn't ask for more. I will def come back soon. I would get the creamy yellow tail it was my favorite. Candy cane was great as well"}
{"text":"Love this place! best sushi for the price in town. Staff is always friendly and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"When you're craving great sushi at a reasonable price this is where you end up.  Food is very tasty and can't go wrong when you want to try something for the 1st time."}
{"text":"Hands-down the worst sushi I have ever had. I can't for the life of me understand all the great reviews. Seems a little suspect to me. They use a very low grade fish and it tasted awful. Who knows maybe other things on the menu are good but certainly not the sushi."}
{"text":"Never been to this place before so on a whim thought I would check it out once. It was pretty late on a Sunday and not many places were open and after craving sushi figured why not. Can't be that bad. And It really wasn't. However It wasn't great either.   I love sushi and I have been to many sushi places and I would say this place is just average. The fish wasn't horrible but it was not the best I have had either.   The service was pretty good. And that's why I'm rating it a 4 Star experience. Staff was very friendly and very accommodating.   The place was not very large but it was late and there weren't very many people inside but yet we were seated next to 6 high school students. To make matters worse they were drinking. Now I don't have a problem with people drinking and having a good time but these kids did not even look old enough to drink. And the more they had to louder they got.   We ate our food pretty quickly. Paid our tab and left. I likely wouldn't return.   Overall very average sushi place."}
{"text":"Get the love boat. It is the best bang for your buck. I believe it is about 20 bucks, and will feed 2 adults. That's a great value, if you ask me. That being said, this is not the most visually appealing place. It needs a little work in that aspect."}
{"text":"Scottish roll!!!!! It's the best, I love the unique menu at this restaurant. I am always greeted with a smile and the desserts are amazing. The fried ice cream was truly tasty. My children love the teriyaki beef, and the deep-fried cheesecake."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this place. They have some Excellent Rolls and Sashimi, and the service is excellent. I am not sure why the news has not been released, but this place is a gem. I love the sushi here, and frequent this establishment at least 6 times a month.  They have just remodeled the restaurant, and they have a new sushi bar, and have added more seating to the place. Sambo is an outstanding Sushi Chef, and they have FRESH fish. My personal favorites are the Saguaro Roll, Santa Fe Roll, Lemon Roll, Princess Roll, Tuna Sashimi, Red Rock Roll and Spicy Tuna.  They have a great happy hour, and there is a patio for seating during the nice weather months.  I wish more people would frequent this place, as I think that if you like sushi and want to stay to a budget, then you need to have dinner or lunch at Four Seasons."}
{"text":"Still extremely happy with this place, and upon reflection, wish to add the great value here, after going to Sushi Eye on a Friday night and dropping $120 between 2 of us, with a comparable huge meal coming out to be $70 here.  Nigiri excellent rice-to-fish ratio, with the fish definitely being the star of the show."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in az. This place really picked up since the new owner (Sean) took over. I wish he was there when I was a student at ATStill university. Now I drive all the way from tempe to eat sushi but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place, as there was a sushi place less than a mile from our new home.   And it wasn't bad. However, it wasn't great either.   The sushi was average or maybe even a bit below. The prices were good. And the atmosphere was a bit disappointing.   We're giving this place a second chance, though, in the hopes that we caught them on an off day."}
{"text":"Very good!  We ordered salmon sashimi, bulgogi, and two different rolls which I cannot recall the names. One was wrapped with cucumber and was delicious.  The other had eel and was equally good!  We will definitely be back.  The server was wonderful.   He kept our drinks filled and was very prompt with all service."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. If you want Business don't argue with customers. Whatever they are doing with the rice doesn't taste right. I am a regular customer and come in twice a week and I felt very harassed and I didn't feel welcome. The women's bathroom never has hand soap! How are they washing their hands? This place is last on my list :("}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Great prices! The poppers are amazing! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is so top notch.  I love being able to see pictures of the sushi on the menu.  (That is how you know a place is GOOD) Always fresh, and tastes outstanding.  I would eat every roll on the menu if I could, but I highly recommend the Arizona Roll, and the Candy Cane Roll.  Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Priced so right and it's so good! Happy hour all say everyday and you can combine with lunch specials!!! Cheapest white tuna in town!"}
{"text":"As others below have expressed, this is my \"go to\" sushi place.  Over the past 5 years I've probably eaten here something like 50 times -- I may not be unbiased, but I am consistent (as is their food).  I enjoy the luncheon combos -- many come with half a CA roll; my favorite (Combo A) is 4 nice pieces of nigiri & an entire CA roll ($7.00).  Often I have a meal of a CA roll & a shrimp tempura roll (a bit more than $10).  My partner enjoys the AZ roll.  Perhaps because I'm a regular, but the staff is very attentive & friendly.  Not to be a \"homer\" I've given it 4 stars, but as you can tell I eat here quite a bit.  Don't claim to be a sushi expert, but I love this little neighborhood place."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in arizona! I drive all the way from glendale just to eat here!"}
{"text":"Ate here several times and the place it a great place for some sushi.  It is surely not a big fancy Scottsdale place with the glam but if you are looking for a good place to get some sushi for a decent price then check this place out.  They have all day happy hour and their sushi is very tasty.  I've only eaten the sushi here so I cannot comment on the other foods on the menu."}
{"text":"YUCK! I typically enjoy sushi, but the numerous occasions I have been here, it just seems as if the service is HORRIBLE, and the sushi is even worse. It is not fresh, I hate to say this for lack of a better word, but just tastes 'funky'.   The reason it gets at least 2 stars is because it is very cheap, and they have some unique roll ideas. I like the lemon roll. I would recommend that if you want to check this place out yourself. I also got the spicy tuna, and the southwestern roll. The seaweed and veggies that were coming out of the end looked wilted and not fresh.  Try it for yourself, if you are looking for good prices on sushi. If you want good service and fresh ingredients, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We loved this place.  Yes, it's in a strip mall and not much to look at from the outside but the interior is fine - nothing fancy but you definitely know you're in a japanese restaurant from the decoration, the loud greeting from the chef, and the friendly staff.  The food was excellent, especially for the price (and in MESA! - who'd have thought?).  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi I've had. True to price, cheap price = semi decent in taste. Probably wont come back but it was worth a try."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour! The staff is so nice and the fish is fresh - can't beat the prices"}
{"text":"Gave this place a try based on the good reviews.  Beautiful small restaurant with fantastic food.  So yummy.  The sushi rolls were amazing.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place, local family favorite, staff is very friendly and personable. Sushi and rolls are great and reasonably priced. It's my kids restaurant if choice!"}
{"text":"Owners and workers are super nice, prices are really good for fresh sushi. The sashimi is delicious and also very fresh considering we aren't next to the ocean. If sushi is your jam this place is definitely worth a shot. The ambience is nothing special but the food is quality."}
{"text":"What is wrong with people not taking coupons??  Small businesses with small minds!  Manager/owner?? here repeatedly called Entertainment Book a \"fraud\"!  Really??  Wow, that book is how I found out about this place and is why I went here in the first place!  Lame excuses for not giving a few bucks discount!  To be fair, they took my coupon but charged me full price instead of their 5:00-to-closing happy hour prices which negated the coupon and reason I went here looking for something new."}
{"text":"Great sushi and affordable prices. The staff takes good care of you and the sushi chefs are amazing. I've been to other sushi restaurants in the area, but I always come back to Four Seasons. Highly recommend this hidden gem"}
{"text":"If you're in the gilbert area and you are looking for a quick and cheap sushi hit, this the place to be. And since this place is quick and cheap, the taste isnt anything to  go wild over. It definitely fulfills your sushi urges, but this is one of those places you go to secretly and try not bragging about - kinda like when you make that booty call to that woman who could pass for your grandma, but is still pretty good looking - you're not proud of it, but hey, sometimes you dont always have time for the best.  They have a great selection of maki rools,..the california and philly rolls are my mainstays....these rolls are extremely difficult to mess up and this place manages to keep that sentiment going  The Las Vegas Roll and the Southwestern Roll (or it could have been the Santa Fe Roll) are actually 4 star worthy. The southwestern/santa fe roll hsa has fresh jalapenos and has a really good kick.  This place can get busy, so if you are in a rush...call in your order."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed my experiences eating at Four Seasons very much. Not only is the sushi fresh and delicious, the atmosphere are warm and comfortable. The happy hour specials are like no other place I have been. The employees are so very gracious and kind. I find good service hard to find in a good sushi restaurant. I will return to the Four Seasons Sushi Bar & Grill many times."}
{"text":"Slow service, food we received was only so-so compared to Sakana or RA.  They also didn't bring our 6 orders of salmon nigiri and served salads with frozen lettuce.  Bad night for four seasons. :("}
{"text":"The service was friendly and restaurant clean. Free wifi is always appreciated!! Sitting outside was a nice option. The ladybug roll was ok, kind of plain for my taste. The Sante Fe was really tasty. Iced Tea tasted like maybe they used the coffee maker without rinsing the filter? Dunno but it had a bit of a coffee after taste which I am not a fan of. I'd try this place again but not sure if I would crave it. Worth giving them a try. Happy hour prices look really good."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Went during happy hour. Very pleased with service and quality of food. Will definitely eat here again. Normal hours seem a little pricey, but not bad."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow. Cocktails and appetizers left something to be desired, and the sushi rolls had a bit too much sauce and became soggy.   The fish seemed fresh and the flavors of the specialty rolls were good overall. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Like most people with a healthy desire for self-preservation, I am pretty wary about the idea of so-called cheap sushi. Keeping raw fish fresh enough to eat without dire results is expensive, and that is one corner I really don't like to see cut. Given this I was hesitant to try Four Seasons after taking a look at their incredibly low menu prices. But fortunately for Four Seasons and their diners, low-quality fish is not the path they take to keeping prices disconcertingly low.  Their secret? Well, there's a few. There is, as the wait staff will inform you upon seating, a minimum amount you have to spend. I forget exactly what the number is because I have never been in danger of falling short of it. But it might be a concern if you're stopping by for a solo lunch. Also, the rolls are fairly small and not exactly bursting with fish. They try to make up for that with a bunch of sauces and innovative chef creations. Some of these are delicious, like the Las Vegas, Saguaro, and Cardinals rolls. Others are too busy, like the Banzai roll. Some are just weird, like the Albacore and Sweet Onion roll. Nothing's terrible, but some are going to seem like more of a deal than others. The good news is that with these prices you can afford to experiment. Kitchen items like appetizers and yakisoba are worth getting here, though again, they won't knock your socks off.   The interior is well-appointed, the staff is friendly and competent, and there are plenty of great shops nearby to walk to after eating. While Four Seasons is probably not going to top anyone's list of best sushi places, it's combination of very good sushi and low prices might make it a favorite. It's certainly one of my favorites."}
{"text":"New management has led to hiring a new sushi chef and new waiters/waitresses. The service people now speak with normal intonation, and you now get an orange for dessert after every meal.   Unfortunately this still isn't a stand-out place. And the strange tendency to pair Japanese entrees with macaroni salad kind of weirds me out.  Sticking with 3 stars."}
{"text":"ok ok I came  back for lunch lots of specials food was good our wait person was friendly and efficent ."}
{"text":"Great service! Don't worry if you don't know what things are, just ask, and they'll let you know.    Happy Hour is where its at. 5-7PM with specials on appetizers, rolls, and sake bombers. Things are fresh, tasty, and in a cute atmosphere. They also have pretty good lunch specials."}
{"text":"Four Seasons is a solid sushi joint in my neighborhood. Good service. Have ordered takeout as well. Rainbow Roll & Caterpillar Roll is fantastic here. Only reason I take away 1 star is because their version of Las Vegas Roll and Volcano Roll are just slightly sub par to what I've had at other places nearby. Sushi will always vary a bit depending on the chef. Overall, they're a safe and yummy choice close to home."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, reasonable prices, and the staff is always so friendly. Would highly recommend for sushi :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Service is excellent. Sushi is super fresh!!! Great prices on sushi and even better 5pm to close during happy hour."}
{"text":"If you live in the area, this is a good place to get a sushi fix without having to drive 20 minutes to get to a really good sushi restaurant.  However, this place is far from my first choice.  When I have the time, I'll spend the 20 minutes driving to something better.  But I don't always have the time, so this place is convenient for lunch, or dinner when I don't feel like driving 20 minutes somewhere else.  The service is inconsistent.  Sometimes I'm out really fast, but other times I'm waiting for a long time for service.  It helps to tell them you're in a hurry to get back to work by 1 if that's your situation."}
{"text":"Sushi was fine. Definitely not the best place in Gilbert as many reviews say. Sorry you guys haven't had better experiences than this. My biggest complaint is how grimy this place is. I have been here many times , as the sushi is adequate. The sushi bar top seems to have a permanent layer of stickiness.  Very uncomfortable to relax at the bar. I have not had any terrible experiences with the sushi here, also no really good experiences either. I don't really recommend this place, but I also wouldn't say to avoid it like the plague. All the 5 star reviews are suspect or people that just don't get out much."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place before... I frequent this restaurant at least once a week. It is my absolute favorite sushi in this area. The caterpillar roll is the star of this fine establishment. We also really like the the Philly roll, lemon roll, Santa Fe roll, Shrimp lovers roll... Heck we've probably tried them all. The sashimi is always really awesome as well. Go here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here a few times a month for the past year and we have never been disappointed! They have the best tasting sushi at the best prices!! Everything comes out fresh and the staff is very nice and professional. Thank you four seasons staff for taking such good care of us always. :) we will never go to any other sushi place."}
{"text":"The kids meals were larger than expected, food was quick, everything tastes fresh and service was excellent. Came around 730p on a Monday. Presentation of the food made everything look mouth watering"}
{"text":"This place is great! The have happy hour from 4pm - 7pm (I think) and most things are half off. The quality is awesome. This is by far my new favorite sushi joint and its right on my way home from work. This place is small and quaint inside and the staff is super nice. They have huge selection of rolls and everything else."}
{"text":"Sushi tasted amazing! We got the medusa, golden California and popcorn shrimp. It tasted very fresh! And they give you a lot! We also ordered the fried calamari but it tasted a little funky. Once you bite into the calamari it had a weird soggy taste to it. Not sure if it's how it's supposed to taste but I never tasted fried calamari like that. The green iced tea was delicious! My husband also ordered himself spicy chicken bowl and it tasted amazing! Overall not bad and definitely will be back! :)"}
{"text":"The sushi here is good. Go during happy hour, because the prices are great! The service was really fantastic. The staff were friendly, helpful, and polite. My first experience here was a really good one. I'll be back whenever I'm back in town."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on Wednesday evening. The dining room is clean and has a nice atmosphere. The service is great. All our food came out perfect and delicious."}
{"text":"Always great sushi here!  Quick service and oh so tasty.  We like to go with friends and family and we always joke that we're gonna need a bigger boat!"}
{"text":"Someone suggested this sushi restaurant to me while I was eating at another one.  It's about 30 miles from my house, so I waited until I was in the area to try it out.  Finally, after a couple of months, some personal business took me to the area.    I thought this restaurant was going to be in a Four Seasons hotel.  So, I was mistaken on that one.  It is basically in a shopping center type area.    The sushi was fresh and well-prepared, though.  We had the seared tuna, scallops, salmon, yellowtail, ama ebi (sweet shrimp) and seared albacore nigiri sushi (2 pieces each) and a soft shell crab roll.  Each of those was very good.    We also ordered the pork katsu large plate that came with rice, salad, some mixed vegetables and miso soup.  The pork katsu was very good...cooked just right...crunchy but not hard...the mixed vegetables were excellently prepared.   The broccoli was cooked just right...which is rarely accomplished at most restaurants I've been to.    I ordered hot green tea and, contrary to one of the reviewers from back in 2011, it was delicious and came in a large cup...and was refilled at no charge.  And, finally, Thomas waited on us and he was very nice and accommodating.  He was very busy, but always checked in with us to see that we were doing alright.  He always re-filled our drinks and was just a pleasure.  It turns out he is also the manager and it shows.  He takes a great amount of pride in his restaurant.  Kudos to Thomas!"}
{"text":"Great place. Prompt service. Philly roll, Avocado Poppers, and Orange Blossom roll were great!"}
{"text":"What a surprise to find this cozy joint in this neck of the woods!  It's the most authentic sushi bar I've experienced in the East Valley.  The chef was really a Japanese man and didn't speak a word of English, nor did he smile.  He is the type of sushi nazi most small authentic joints employed, ha.  The restaurant layout was very traditional with a lowered bar and stools and curtains splashed with Japanese designs separating the kitchen.  It probably holds less than 20ppl inside.  Just the kind of intimacy I sometimes prefer.  We sat at the bar and ordered a few traditional rolls and I have to say the rice was superb and the spicy tuna was well seasoned and yummy.  Would like to go back again soon :)"}
{"text":"Meh, not bad, not good, just meh.  Came here after a stressful day of school and decided to treat myself to some sushi. We had recently got a doorhanger of their menu at our house so I took a dive and decided to try 'em. Arrived during happy hour (it was dead inside- an omen?) and ordered out deciding on the rainbow roll and two spicy tunas. I figured you can't really go wrong with either selection. The waiter was really nice and even offered me a free drink while I waited but kindly declined since I feel bad taking things without paying...  Unfortunately when they rung me up and I saw my check - DURING happy hour- I should have rethought that free drink!  (Perhaps happy hour doesn't apply to take out?? *note: didn't see it listed anywhere on their in restaurant menu*... but maybe I should have brought my grandma's reading glasses to search for super, fine print *wink wink*.   Got the sushi home and was pleasantly surprised with the amount they gave me. Couldn't wait to dig in, until I grabbed a piece with my chopsticks and at first bite could taste that the fish was quite warm and rubbery....ick, so I threw it in the fridge to give to my cats later. [Even I'll admit, that's probably the most expensive meal my two babies have ever feasted on, but at least someone got to enjoy the rolls!]"}
{"text":"Best Sushi in AZ. My wife is from Hawaii. She approves. We always come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"The sushi is okay. I've definitely had better, but I like this place because it's so cheap! Also it's close to where I live and go to school, so that is convenient. A lot of my friends don't like the quality of this place, but I would say it's above average in terms of sushi places here in Arizona. There's a pretty extensive menu for rolls and the usual nigiri and sashimi. The drink special is quite awesome if you can make it there on time.   The service can be spotty sometimes. I think the worst time to go is during lunch because it is so crowded and people are usually on a limited time schedule. Dinner can get super busy too especially during happy hour."}
{"text":"1st time here.. great service. ..and all the food was great..Also the price for all the food we ate ..can't believe the price..totally coming back"}
{"text":"Our family ended up trying this restaurant by default. We were actually trying to go next door, but they were closed.   We were happy to see that they were priced very moderately. The teriyaki bowls were only like 7 bucks and were a great deal. They are one of the few places that serve bulgogi, and the meat was tender and tasty. The sushi is ok and is moderately priced as well.  (I think the octopus was fake though.) The happy hour sushi pricing made it well worth it!  The service was really great. The only thing I wasn't crazy about is that they served things whenever they were ready and didn't serve them at the same time. Some people were almost finished with their meal by the time others receive theirs. Our drinks were never empty and our empty plates were never sitting around waiting to be taken.    We will definitely be returning here soon."}
{"text":"I am a die hard philly roll lover and this place has really delicious philly rolls!    It's sad they are closed from 2pm to 5pm because often i would like a late lunch/early dinner. But it's their business so I suppose they do what they gotta do."}
{"text":"Great sushi , very friendly staff , nice to see people smiling and enjoying the place , we will be back for sure , great happy hour too !!! 5 stars check them out for sure"}
{"text":"5 rolls and two beers for under $50! Can't beat this place. Amazing prices and even better sushi. Happy hour all day long!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place, it has potential, but the service is not good.  I had ordered a creamy salmon roll and it was awful.  The fish in the middle was hard and I couldn't even chew it.  When I tried to address the matter with my server, she just looked at me sideways.  My guess is she doesn't really speak English so it was hard to communicate the issue.  I was not offered to get anything else and I was still charged for the roll I only ate one piece of.  No reason to return if they can't accommodate"}
{"text":"First visit for us, a couple. Very inviting cozy atmosphere with very attentive wait service. Great happy hour prices and selection. A very large menu selection that we will try on a return visit. If you're looking for good service, good prices and good selections try Four Seasons."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from this place. First and last time going here, don't waste your time or money"}
{"text":"We had lunch here and really enjoyed it. The sushi was not the best I've had, but it was good. The server is what made it a very enjoyable meal, she was very attentive and smiled the whole time. I plan on going back!"}
{"text":"Great sushi! Excellent service and friendly staff...  This IS the place to go! Many regular customers come here and continue to rave indicating BEST sushi I've ever had! Not to mention a regular that was sitting next to me stumbled across this place years ago and comes here as often as he's able even though it's miles away from his home!"}
{"text":"By far some of the best sushi in town. Try the Fiji Apple saki. It's amazing!! Seriously though......best sushi in town."}
{"text":"Four Seasons is one of my favorite sushi places. If not my absolute favorite. The creamy salmon and oshinko roll are my top two must haves. I have never disliked a roll I've ordered. The red crown is my husbands favorite. Great prices and such a fun atmosphere. Amazing staff!"}
{"text":"We have been here so many times and every single time it's delicious!! Always fresh and new fun rolls to try! Miso is on point and the house salad is just the right size and yummy!!"}
{"text":"The Las Vegas roll is a must try, I have had them at many different places but theirs is my favorite! Just know that if you order sushi to go you do not get the happy hour prices."}
{"text":"OMG! The food here reminds me of home! Back in Hawaii we have the best sushi and Hawaiian poke \"raw fish w kukui nut and seaweed salad\" and the service is great. Even tho the ambiance is a bit like a sports bar it is clean and the fish is fresh! Four Seasons sushi will NOT take and arm and a leg when it comes to prices! So if you got that craving for sushi I think everyone needs to cruz on over and enjoy the great treats that Four Seasons Sushi has to offer!"}
{"text":"I think many of these reviewers haven't been here in a while- The place is in transition, so while it may be a bit confusing getting multiple menus, their sushi is cheap.   The waiters and waitresses have always been extremely kind to me, and even gave me samples of stuff their changing on the menu. Sure, it may not be the best sushi EVER, but it's tasty, affordable, and I like the people who work there.  Also, because of the changes it has happy hour prices every day all day. Keep in mind though if you order takeout, you do not get the happy hour prices. I like going there for lunch (I work nearby) because you can pick two sushi rolls and get soup, salad, and an orange thing for dessert, all for about 6 or 7 bucks.  As far as their rolls, I really like their lemon roll =]"}
{"text":"We like to try new sushi places, so this was next on our list to try and I'm glad we did! We had 3 rolls, a side of rice, a glass of wine, and an iced tea -- plus the complimentary egg drop soup and salad they served -- and the total bill was only $27! We were pleasantly surprised to learn it was Happy Hour during a busy time on a Friday night. All the rolls were great and very filling. The service was great and the food was served quickly. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing..... They asked us 5 times if we got our Vegas roll. They made for damn sure we had our food. Our vein popping homie that we nick named broomstick Bram made sure we stayed thirsty up until we paid the bill. If you are a stoner don't go there because you won't get your drinks. You will walk out foaming from the mouth looking like a rabid dog."}
{"text":"Don't go. Period.   The sushi chef is the only thing that's nice here.  I hate to be so harsh but there's plenty of sushi restaurant that will put more care into their establishment. Restaurant appears run down, dishes not the cleanest, and to top it off...dirty floors. Should have walked out the moment I saw this. My mistake.    We ordered a sashimi combo, spider roll, cherry blossom roll, volcano roll, medusa roll, and Galbi. Sushi was all the same sauce with thin slices of fish. Nothing special. The fish seems a bit on the warmer side which makes me question the temperature in wish they keep their raw fish. Galbi had a weird odor and taste. We stopped eating it immediately and left the entire plate untouched. Service was really slow. Our waitress kept disappearing.   Without bashing them any further, I'll just leave this review here for those who do their homework before visiting a joint.   TRUST ME WHEN I SAY...SKIP THIS ONE."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices!! I am not a sushi fan but my husband and daughter love it. I can go and get yakisoba or rice which is extremely yummy. The family loves their sushi as well. They are very nice there and are quick to make sure everything is as you like it. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"the miso? soothing. the salad? dressing taste's like a damn big mac  the tempura? oh now we gettin there.. fire the sushi? fireeeee  the rich roll? absolute f***ing fireee  and decent prices too.   5 stars for having the tastiest sushi and friendliest service."}
{"text":"This place is a little bit of a ways away from me, but I needed to take a break from Teharu, so we headed here for happy hour. They had some great specials, and it looked like they renovated the place since the last time I went there. Prices are good at $6.50 average per roll. My bf and I ordered 4 different rolls, an appetizer and spicy udon pasta and our bill was under $50. Any sushi dinner under $50, I'm a fan. (Blue Wasabi 2 drinks 2 appetizers 1 roll $70= not a fan)"}
{"text":"I love this place.  They always have the freshest fish in thier sushi rolls.  I went to another sushi place in Gilbert the other week and they had chewy seaweed where I thought I would never be able to swallow it.  I have been to Four Seasons many times and have never had anything less than great.  They always have extended happy hour specials.  I recently tried the red bean mochi ice cream and is was fabulous.  Since this place is so close to home it will be my go-to sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"We go back often, but I'd go more!  The sushi is superb & price quite within our range."}
{"text":"Today was the 2nd time I ordered food from this establishment, but the first time I decided to sit inside.   The staff was quick to seat me, got my drink order, and my meal selection in a timely fashion.  The food came out shortly after I orders,, and the presentation was incredible.  The chef even asked me how I enjoyed my meal.  If you check in with Yelp, you get a 10% off your order.  Since I was there for lunch, I did not have to wait long for my receipt and it was handled with precision.  I would definitely  try this place again."}
{"text":"Despite the bad reviews here on Yelp, a friend of mine raves about this place so since I was in the area, I decided to check it out.    Their happy hour isn't anything special.  Mainly appetizers and no sushi rolls.  Their sushi rolls are dirt cheap so you don't even need to go during happy hour.    My favorite roll was the LadyBug.  Try it!  It's delicious.    We ordered 6 rolls and 1 drink and walked away stuffed and under 40 bucks.    Service was fast, friendly and efficient.  Convenient location, right off the freeway.  Place was packed too, always a good sign."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place!!! It is our \"go to\" sushi restaurant! The price is fair and the sushi is amazing! I've also had their fried rice and chicken, yummy yummy! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"So this sushi bar WINS!!  Hands down my husbands and my favorite place in the east valley!! Their fish is always fresh! Seriously we dream about eating here!! Honestly you need to try their Arizona rolls and their creamy yellow tail is amazing!! Also I love rainbow rolls and it's hard to find a good one but wow it's great here! I recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Authentic affordable and quick. I've been going here for years. Really fast service and I recommend the golden California roll."}
{"text":"Came here once several years ago. I think it was our first sushi in the east valley, and we really enjoyed it. The vegetables were crisp, the fish was pretty fresh, and the sushi chef was making the food right in front of you.  We sat at the bar in front of the chef on our visit. Small wait staff, but it is a small restaurant and it gives you the opportunity to watch the chef prepare the food while you wait. We tried a couple of different rolls which were served with wasabi and pickled ginger. We had some soup which was pretty tasty, and I believe we also ordered a chicken entree. I do remember one of the rolls was the princess roll: very good!  Food was well priced, and their website and menu in-store offer a lot of explanation on what different rolls are and what ingredients are in each one.  Clean atmosphere, friendly service, a lot of selection, and good prices will mean we will definitely have to try Four Seasons again."}
{"text":"Let me just say that sushi is my absolute favorite. I eat it as much as I can. I have also tried a lot of sushi restaurants in my search for the best. This place is def comparable to the best places back in LA. Sometimes the service is slow, but that is because they are busy. They are always polite though. Now let's get to the good stuff. The sushi is delicious. It is super cheap for sushi ($6 rolls) and the quality is excellent. I always come here when I want good sushi."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  What I got: Southwestern Roll. Rating: 3/5 Spicy Scallop Roll. Rating: 2.5/5 Yellow tail with Scallion. Rating: 3/5  If you're from the Berkeley area, its like eating at Tako Sushi - cheaper, near campus, but not memorable. I would say spend the extra dollars on going to another Sushi Place.   I only come here with my classmates - when we're rushed and looking for something fast and nearby campus. The two times I've ate here my friend told me that I didn't each much. I replied: \"I generally will eat if I really enjoy the food.\" I felt that I should have used the money to eat here on eating at another restaurant.   The rolls itself were very plain. I asked for spicy mayo in order to eat the rest of my rolls."}
{"text":"I are here for the first time today with my husband, his aunt, and his aunts boyfriend. We walked in and were greeted right away. The service was friendly. While waiting for our sushi, we munched on side salad and miso soup. The miso soup was absolutely AWFUL. The miso here was probably the worst that I have ever had. The restaurant was redeemed when I started eating my sushi. The smoked salmon was amazing. The four of us stuffed out faces. I had one beer and my husband had two. Our bill for all four of us was $70. Try this place. You won't be disappointed and if you are, at least you won't be out of a lot of cash. Great prices!"}
{"text":"The worst $20 I've spent on food. The miso is disgusting. It's free, but I'd rather pay for good miso. Servers can't always understand special requests and substitutions. Some of the raw as well as cooked fish is fishy. Teriyaki chicken is dried out. Teriyaki salmon is fishy. Lunch special comes w salad in a bowl and more on the plate along with really bland unpleasant macaroni salad. Definitely never coming back"}
{"text":"Some kids and I stopped in here for lunch on a whim. I was very impressed. Sushi was excellent, service was excellent and the prices were good as well. I will be back and will be bringing adult friends next to around."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and the food is always fresh and very good. We have tried the crab puffs and they are very good. I like that they have pictures with each of the sushi rolls on the menu. We have gotten the Las Vegas roll (my favorite), popcorn shrimp roll and both were very good. They always bring out miso soup and a small salad which is nice. We have also gotten the volcano and the fish tempura. The restaurant is quiet and kept clean. The food comes out quickly and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Our favorite! Attentive wait staff. We love the rolls especially the Red Crown. My husband loves the Sushi combo 6 piece. I am kinda addicted to this place right now because of the Golden Chilly."}
{"text":"Always here or getting take out. Always yummy. Everyone is friendly and efficient. Favorite roll - Sunrise."}
{"text":"Great fresh fish. Try the spider roll and shrimp tempura. Also a very friendly staff who always welcomes you and appreciates you being there. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I'm gonna go with a strong 4 on this one. I had sushi combination a and the pork katsu lunch. The miso and salad were meh whatever but the actual food was good. The katsu was a bit thinner than I'm used to but wasn't too bad. The maccoroni salad it came with was good tho I still can't figure out how pasta salad ends up in Japanese lunch box plates. I definitely approve of the sushi. The quality is there as is the portion sizes. Prices at lunch are very reasonable at $6-$10 for most specials."}
{"text":"This place has decent sushi rolls at decent prices. I've pretty much narrowed my choices to the baked Alaskan roll that has salmon on top and the southwest roll with slices of spicy jalapeños. The sushi isn't amazing or anything special but it is close to school, has decent portions and price and never has a long wait."}
{"text":"3 Stars for happiness.  I've been spoiled with fantastic sushi from Oregon, Maine, and Hong Kong and so far Arizona had been the suck.  A friend suggested this place so I went.  Being from Tempe, this is a little out of the way and it looks a little downscale.  The service was really very nice to my wife and I and the sushi chefs even chatted with us from time to time (I ALWAYS sit at the sushi bar itself).  The rolls were reasonably priced and most were really well executed.  It can get awkwardly rowdy in there when a table starts shooting Saki bombs.  The confined space makes for a ruckus.  My grades: Food: B (Freshness: B+, Execution: B-) Service: B- (I would like to be visited at least once during my meal to see if I want more tea instead of flagging you down) Price: B"}
{"text":"I came here for the lunch special on a weekday just as they opened. I was the first one there and was greeted and seated immediately. I showed the waitress my Yelp 10% off check-in offer and she said it would be deducted from the check. I chose the Lunch Special combo E. This was a spicy yellowfin roll and a spicy tuna roll. The miso and salad were out first. The miso was ok, nothing great and the salad what can I say, its lettuce.  The sushi came out quickly. I could see the rolls being made behind the glass counter. The spicy yellowfin had a good flavor and a nice little bite. The spicy tuna was good but not as spicy. The dish was garnished with wasabi and ginger. My only issue was it was white ginger, not the pink which I prefer.  The meal wad good and reasonably priced during the lunch hour special, $7.50 The same meal would be more any other time. I would stop in again if I were in the neighborhood and had a sushi craving."}
{"text":"I have called right before coming in due to the fact that I was busy at work.  The staff answered promptly and said that they will honour the prices for lunch for showing up at 3pm but still ended up charging the dinner price at the end.  We went in and they did that.  The service was nice but the criticism comes in food.  The agetofu was lightly fried and has a tart taste to it which means the freshness is in question and low grade dry fish was served.  The Korean sushi chef got my order wrong and gave me smelt fish eggs instead of the salmon fish egg (Ikura) after I returned it and give no apologies.  The Ikura was soaked Sake which means that the caviar was not fresh and had a brown colour instead of the fresh light orange so for someone who grew up in sushi--this is unacceptable.   The squid salad was full of cumcumbers instead of the squid which meant that they cut corners on the final product.  Tea and sodas were filled and the staff were attentive..below average food so I will probably not return again unless these issues are addressed."}
{"text":"Being from CA, I am kind of a sushi snob. I don't like most places I've been to around here but I really like this place. I feel that this is easily the best place in the area."}
{"text":"Who would have known this place has happy hour sushi if it weren't for Yelp? I wouldn't have!  It wasn't quite half off, but a good selection of their rolls and nigiri pieces are $1 off at happy hour. I went on a Wednesday at 6 PM and business was doing well. All the tables were full and people around the bar. The prices are reasonable to begin with, most of the basic rolls are about $3.50-$4.50 so $1 off I think is a great deal. The nigiri is obviously cheaper.   Great quality too and extremely friendly service. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I will not be returning to Four Seasons, due to the following; 1. The beverage I ordered was hot green tea. It was the worst tea I've ever tasted. To this day I still think that it was not even tea. It was a murky, brownish-green color, and tasted like dirty salt water. 2. The waiter could not understand my appetizer order. I ordered vegetable tempura, but he kept on verifying that I was ordering the shrimp tempura combination. This went on for 5 minutes. 3. We ordered miso soup and it never arrived at the table. When I told the waiter that we never received the soup, he said \"yes it is right here on the ticket.\" It took another 5 minutes for him to realize that it never arrived, and was not ingested.  4. The food was sub-par and not fresh."}
{"text":"Super yummy, I did have to place an order and come back an hour later for pick up, but the rolls were fresh.  :)  It's not my favorite Vegas roll, but the princess is good,and so is the Hawaiian and Rainbow."}
{"text":"They have a pretty decent happy hour here for sushi.  The staff is very friendly and the Alaska roll is delicious.  The booths are a little tight so ask for a table if you need more room."}
{"text":"On of my favorite places to go for great sush. Plus, the prices are very reasonably priced. Although the servers always seem to be changing, they are always on top of everything and provide great service. When the sushi chefs are trying new rolls, there's a chance you might even get some free sushi!"}
{"text":"I thought my roll was decent but everything else tasted \"off\". My husband declined to eat the Rainbow roll I brought home for him. The fish was obviously not fresh and stunk to high Heaven. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I was in town for business and this place was right around the corner from the hotel. I am huge fan of sushi and I regularly eat sushi (almost weekly). Living in Southern California I am a bit spoiled by the number of good places for fish, so I was concerned about the number of people (or lack there of) on a Saturday night. Sat at the bar, was given a rundown of the menu and options and told about the happy hour. I ordered away and the food came quickly and was very delicious. Just what you would expect from a sushi restaurant. The salmon was buttery, the tuna was on point and they had tobiko (flying fish roe). Gave the DBack roll a try and it was tasty but not my favorite.  I ate more than my fill for a very reasonable price (under $40). Go check this place out. I think it is a hidden gem. Maybe it needs better signage or something, but if you like your sushi, add Four Seasons to your rotation."}
{"text":"Awful service, sushi is not even worth mentioning. Cannot believe this place is still open. We sat at sushi bar and were not greeted when we walked in or sat at the bar. Same goes for everyone else who came in behind us. They do not have enough staff to keep this place clean or keep the flow going. The sushi chefs are armatures. In the 45 min there, I never saw either of the sushi chefs or waiter talk to anyone. All tables & spots at sushi bar were left sitting dirty with people eating around them. We actually saw them take a plate from a table that was served the wrong order (had eaten off of it) and clean it up and send it out to another table. Makes me sad to see a place like this so busy when there are others that are struggling to stay open."}
{"text":"This is a good local sushi place. I love how there is always happy hour at all times of day. The only downside to this place is that it seems that sometimes they are understaffed and there is a possibility that the food takes longer than normal to arrive."}
{"text":"Best affordable sushi in town! Always great service and attitude from the staff and the sushi is delicious. 10/10"}
