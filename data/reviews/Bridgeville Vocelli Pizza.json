{"text":"Ordered a grilled chicken salad for lunch but there's new mgmt at this location and they didn't check to see that  the lettuce was turning brown. The old mgmt team would check the lettuce before serving a salad that looked this bad. Next time I'll go to subway or Panera."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for delivery. One hour and 40 minutes later and after two phone calls they finally offered me a 50% discount if I were willing to go pick it up at their store. Seriously?"}
{"text":"The management and employees are mostly quite rude, and my business with them was not pleasant. They seemed to care very little about their customer service. The food was okay, but I've had better at other Vocelli locations. This location is for some reason listed twice on the site."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, about par for chain pizza. They had a special the night we were there, but didn't tell us about it on the website. It's ok, we ordered a specialty pizza anyway. However, it wasn't ready when they said it would be. I think they put it in the oven when were showed up to pick it up."}
