{"text":"Definitely one of the single worst service experiences I've ever had. Our server, Heaven, did not approach our table once during the hour we were there. She had a 30 minute conversation two tables away from us and did not acknowledge our presence once. A trainee, the bartender and kitchen staff all were working our table to make up for her lack of service. Not once during the evening did a manager step in nor did he seem too concerned when I shared my experience. This restaurant and complex overall has great potential, but the management clearly isn't there."}
{"text":"OMG was this place amazing. Couldn't have asked for a better experience. Resturant is part of Zone28 but completely sectioned off from the bowling alley and arcade. There are windows so you can see all the action but not hear it, kind of makes for an exciting atmosphere. Our server was great, super fast, we ordered our food and it seemed like 5 minutes later it was at our table. They have all the typical categories of bar/lounge type food (apps, sandwiches, salads, burgers, steaks) but not a huge selection from each category. I'd say that's ok though since what they do have on their menu is made very well. The fries are amazing, get them. Food was reasonably priced, despite being at an entertainment center. At the end of our meal the waitress handed each of us $5 in arcade credits! Apparently they were doing a promotion and it definitely worked on us. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I don't know what was worse the service or the food.  Our server was so overwhelmed and while she was taking our order another server decided to yell at her. 

The food took forever to come out and our entrees came our before our appetizers.   The food was inedible. 

If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would."}
{"text":"We had dinner while bowling, our meal was put of this world, completely unexpected for a bowling alley. The kids enjoyed their personal pizzas, and we were pleasantly taken aback by the loaded fries with pulled pork . The resturant is part of Zone 28 (recently renovated formally Fun Fest), family oriented, cost effective and good food. Well worth the visit. 4 out of 5 stars for speed."}
{"text":"Service was slow; however, the food was good. I'd rate it *definitely* better than the old and somewhat better than diner/Eat N Park-type food. Also, the prices are pretty inexpensive. It worked great for us because we were there for a reward night for our son - so we were able to play arcade games and grab a decent dinner all in one stop."}
{"text":"The food is ok... I had the Italian sandwich, grilled cheese, chicken strips, and a spicy chicken wrap trying to keep it simple. The Italian sandwich should be on a bun, my granddaughter had the spicy chicken wrap she said it was ok, and the chicken strips & grilled cheese you can't go wrong. Treat this restaurant as you would any place where there's kids and games. Keep your expectations low."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I ordered the fish and chips and it was so moist on the inside but crunchy on the outside. The pepper jack cheese bites and the pretzel sticks with cheese were great! The server was friendly, patient and helpful with our large group of 10! I would recommend you check this place out, it's a wonderful place for families, or for date nights!"}
