{"text":"I first went to this place right before I moved in across the street. I was starving and they were friendly and helpful. I only get the cheeseburger special while I'm here, and it's always really good. Yes, the patties are frozen, but they spend a lot of time cooking it and mine is always well done. It takes 20 minutes for me to get my order and it's always delicious. I don't know about the complaints about bad service. Seems like the typical neighborhood mom and pops type of place."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem. Clean and welcoming environment and lovely staff. At 11pm on a Saturday this place was like a blessing. We ordered the meat lovers pizza. Definitely the best choice ever!! For people who prefer halal food , the menu has everything a fast food lover craves. Highly recommended, will definitely return on our next trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the name or the photos. Amateur pizza with flavorless sauce. Very skimpy on ingredients for the price. Ordered once & never going back."}
{"text":"I stopped in to get a hamburger special for lunch. The owner was there in the back, working with pride to make me this hamburger. I had a wonderful conversation with him. He told me that the reason why his food tasted so good is because of his pride. That's why I like this place."}
{"text":"We have halal food restrictions. Tried it for the first time. Bucket of wings was good. Kids loved the pepperoni  pizza. Philly cheese steak was also good.  Lasgna and spaghetti  was ok."}
{"text":"The price of the pizza is very reasonable and they taste really good. The customer service was very polite ."}
{"text":"So terrible, it's not worth going into details, so I'll be brief. 

spaghetti sauce and pizza sauce are not interchangeable
a calzone is not just dough and mozzarella cheese
microwaving frozen chicken fingers for pizza topping is just plain gross and unsanitary, kind of like the conditions of your shop.
One Star."}
{"text":"I went to Italy pizza for the first time a couple nights ago and absolutely loved their pizza!

I ordered one large pizza with pepperoni, beef, and extra cheese, 1/2 bucket of buffalo wings, breadsticks to-go. 

The service was really nice, the man behind the counter was patient while my roommate and I were deciding on what we wanted. 

While waiting for our order to be ready we looked around at their dining area and decorations that hung on their walls. The place seemed pretty clean and they had awards hanging on their wall. I didn't really pay attention but a lot of them were appreciation certificates from police departments. 

We didn't have to wait that long for our food, the pizza was spot on! Not greasy, right amount of cheesy, the chicken wings could've been a bit spicier but next time I'll just ask for hotter wings, and the breadsticks were okay, nothing too exciting  but they were good.


Overall I did like my experience, decibels recommend Little Itally Pizza and I will be visiting them to satisfy late night pizza cravings very soon!!"}
{"text":"We found out about this place on Yelp and believe it or not it is way way better than what you can expect from the stars ranking they have 

First of , the owner was very cool to us , as new guys in town and more in the us ( vacation ) we didn't know what the most thing to eat is , he told us about the Philly Cheese Steak and his CheeseBurger and my brother and I were verse surprised by the taste because it was so yummy and tasty 

To sum it up , it is a very good place to grab something to eat , you'll get your money worth over there with a full belly 

Plus , as Muslims it is entirely halal and they don't sell any alcohol which is rare nowadays lol , the Owner Ahmad was very nice and let us pray in the back 

Muslim or Not Go there you won't be disappointed I promise

{"text":"First time ordering here. 14\" pepperoni was $13. Down the street at Cafe Verdi I can get a 16\" pepperoni for $8 and it's a much better pizza. The pepperoni had a weird texture and flavor. The people working there are very nice and the restaurant looked clean, but I won't go back. I wouldn't even swing buy to pick up a freebie; I couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"Little Italy has the best food around we've been ordering here for 2 years ever since we moved here, the owners and employees are the sweetest people. Delivery is always quick. You have to try their cheeseburgers it's the best I've had!"}
{"text":"OMG amazing pizza very felt like home !! From miami and honest just made me like I was at home but with amazing pizza q
10 thumbs ups"}
{"text":"Very nice service. Very nice food. Owners are really friendly and its entire menu is halal (using halal meat and chicken). Pizza and burgers are good, but not the best, yet it is better than any other halal pizza place I have been to."}
{"text":"What's with all the negative reviews?

First of all, the wife and I have a lot of experience in pizza around threw valley.
We try the exact same pizza in every case (cheese, pepperoni, green pepper and pineapple) and have a few chain favorites (little Caesars, papa johns) but had never tried this place based on these negative help reviews.

Finally I put in An order for our usual and was amazed.

The pizza was hot, fresh, great ingredients, and crust was obviously home made and very very tasty... 

I am amazed that this place doesn't get much better reviews, but we will be back to get the same regular the next time which trust me, is a huge deal for us.

Great work, thanks again,"}
{"text":"Nice setting for family and/or friends. I tried their philly cheese steak and cheeseburger. Burger was quite good; however, \"La Bocce\" remains to be my favorite, by far, when it comes to philly.

Both the burger and the philly come with fries. When I said I did not want any fries, they offered me a free drink."}
{"text":"We came there around 3 .. some dude that worker was being really rude . After i got my food there was something wrong an i told him nicely \" i asks for hot chicken finger \"\" he reply \" no u didnt u should of told me earlier!!\" .. moments later i was going to the bathroom some employee said some thing and then mumble FUCK YOU, after coming out the bathroom my girlfriend told fuck you twice then repeated \"I DONT CARE."}
{"text":"No Italian atmosphere, pizza taste like frozen pizza. One of the worst pizza restaurants. Will never eat there again!"}
{"text":"The pizza is terrible!!! The Sub was even worst. Realistic delivery time is 1.5hr to 2hr easily if you are on the strip at a resort. It is a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I ordered online which was easy and quick.  The food was delivered quickly directly to our hotel room.  Prices were good, pizza was OK, spaghetti with meat sauce not so much..."}
{"text":"was the worst pizza I've ever eaten in my life. It was borned. Vegetables was uncooked."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in town!! The only place a non pork eater can walk in and say, I'll take a double pepperoni, sausage and bacon pizza and know that there is no pork in there at all.. Pizza's are on point there and soooo good, also super affordable for parties!  The owner and staff are very friendly.  A must try for all!"}
{"text":"Delivery arrived very late, 1.5 hours after ordered. Cold, tasteless, cardboard pizza, and ridiculously bland tossed salad. What a waste of time and money. Spend your money elsewhere, otherwise you will be very disappointed."}
{"text":"I have never eaten worse food in my life!!! The food had no flavor and was cold and took an hour and a half to get here. I'm honestly suprised they're still in business!! I'd rather eat my tattoo scabs!!!!"}
{"text":"The server Kevin, thin, tall, and awesome,  made our first night in Vegas special!  His sense of humor, personality,  and menu knowledge helped add to our dining experience. The portions are generous, so be sure to leave room for the Apple Crostada, or just come in for that alone! Great views inside or out!"}
{"text":"Meh , nothing to write home about for sure ... they dont really seem to be proud pizza makers , tourist place . Crust was dense, cheese was just barley melted , i think there was sauce on it , but not much . Tossed it . 
The wings were cooked well though . I liked em ."}
{"text":"I visited Las Vegas last week for Edible Arrangements 10th Convention with my team and needed get some Halal food. To my surprise, the service was great and the food was even better. Anyone in the area looking for Halal Restaurant, this is the place to go. Very friendly service. I don't know the name of the young lady who served us. We went back twice within the same week. 
HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"I'm in vegas for my honeymoon and I was at the strip and wanted to eat something halal so I don't have to eat vegetarian food again so I googled this restaurant I call them and ask them what time they close they said they were about to close but they still stayed open just so I could make it in time and get my food..0 very good service the food was great loved it I would highly recommend it.."}

{"text":"Hubby and I at the philly cheesesteak and it was gr8. God customer service and great food."}
{"text":"One of the worst pizzas I've had in a long time

We had both the garlic chicken pizza and the Philly steak pizza. 

The crust was fluffy and doughy. It was not New York style. The dough was neither Chewy or crisp. It was just fluffy. Nothing to it at all. 

Both pizzas were very light on sauce and cheese. I couldn't taste the sauce on the garlic pizza at all. 
I asked them if I should get extra cheese or if they put a lot of cheese on their pizzas when I ordered. I was told there was a lot of cheese. That was very far from the truth. There was no cheese pull. Nothing 

The garlic chicken pizza had a breaded chicken that had a weird flavor. It just wasn't right. 

I'd never go back. Fast food pizza chains like dominos or papa johns offer a far superior pizza.   I've had better frozen pizza than what this place offers."}
{"text":"We just ate from here .. Food was good portions was nice it was halal .. The owner and chef greeted with Asalamoalikum.. They even reheated my pizza again .. Very courteous .. They let us pray there .. I definitely recommend .. It's a nice and clean little restaurant .. We also ordered Philly cheese burger ...."}
{"text":"This place is open 24 hours and have an excellent fast food/pizza menu. Try out their philli cheese steak pizza. Chicken burger and chicken wings were decent too. Reasonably priced. If i had to choose i will stick to pizza though"}
{"text":"We work for one of the major hotels on the strip.  We work the grave shift and since this place stayed open late, we decided to order from them.  
The chicken fingers looked overcooked and it was stale as were my fries.
We ordered a full bucket of chickn wings-MILD (32 pieces) and only got 1/2 bucket (16 pieces) and they were HOT.
When we called, the owner was extremely rude and made us feel like we were lying.  He asked us if we ate the wings and that he wanted them back.  He never apologized or offered any compensation.
Our order came out to $52...you would think we would get a little bit of customer service.  When we asked how long the driver would be, he said \"he'll be there when he gets there\"!!  Yes!  And this was the OWNER!
When the driver returned, we told him we knew it wasn't his fault but we were very disappointed.  In fact he was the only good thing about this place.  
And guess what?  When we got the wings, the box was melted and the sauce was put on the side in containers and the covers weren't even on.  So all the sauce leaked everywhere.
Wish I could post pictures so you could see how horrible this place is.  DON'T ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"I feel bad writing a poor review about this place because the people working seem like good people. I ordered a calzone w/pepperoni sausage and canadian bacon and though the portion was large and the dough was hot on the outside ...the cheese on the inside was cold and unmelted. The toppings inside the calzone were cold as well. The sauce was straight from a can...This place was slow. No orders came in before or after me and the lady that was cooking my food opened the oven door at least 5 times in the 5 minutes my calzone was cooking...seems logical to me why the toppings were cold."}
{"text":"Lousy food took over an hour to get it delivered cold pasta warm salad,delivery guy didn't want to give me a receipt del said he got lost."}
{"text":"Very delicious,  I had the gyro. Meat is a lil dry but good flavor over all. The fries are yummy, great competitive prices."}
{"text":"Decision was made to find pizza super late at night after bowling.  This was the closest place we could find at the time.  Three of us each ordered a small pizza   I got the meat lovers, and I was extremely pleased.  everything was nice and hot and they served us immediately and made us feel welcome when we came into the store.  I also got the jalapeño poppers and found them to be pretty tasty as well.  overall the service was good and the food delicious"}
{"text":"On my most recent visit, I tried the Philly Cheesesteak with everything and fries for $7.99. It has some potential, but unless mozzarella cheese is not used and unless chef folds cheese into meat instead of melting on top, this sandwich cannot attain greatness. The meat itself is shaved steak, but appears of decent quality and good use of onions and peppers. THe fries were very crispy and in-between thin and thick. Previously I had a really good Chicken parm sandwich lunch special. Probably should try the pizza, but late nite delivery sometimes over rules top quality, although i picked my order up from friendly counter guy."}
{"text":"Ironically, their pizza is nothing worth noticing, with a very bland taste and a war of flavors, in a bad way. The garlic bread though, was absolutely amazing and worth 3 dollars. I will come back to try more food besides their pizzas."}
{"text":"Stumbled on to this place after we went to the Pho place next door and they were packed. Decided to give them a shot, and ordered a pizza half supreme, half cheese. First things I loved about the place was that regardless of the type of pizza, the price was the same. Oh and they stick to their \"ready in 10 minutes\" sign. No kidding, our pizza was ready to go in just under 10 minutes. The crust was fully cooked, the cheese didn't taste like el cheapo queso, and the toppings tasted fresh. If you're in the area, give em a shot. You'll be presently surprised."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. The Philly Cheesteak pizza and White garlic pizza are excellent as are their wings! Food is affordable and 1 mile  away from the strip. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"After moving to Vegas from California, my friend recommended this place to me for some quick and easy pizza. \"Quick and easy\" never really goes with \"absolutely fantastic\" but in this case it definitely does.

I've had pizza here a couple times and it is always delicious. The older gentleman, who I'm assuming is the owner, is super sweet and considerate. The last time I picked up a pizza he had me check to make sure it wasn't cooked too much, seeing as it had been a little well done, and that surprised me a little. It was cooked exactly the way I liked it but how many times have you ordered pizza and they send you some super burnt piece of bread and you end up spending the next hour waiting for it to be recooked, delivered, etc. I really liked the fact that he took the time to make sure it was up to par.

I've also had the jalapeno poppers here and I like that they're made with cream cheese as opposed to the cheddar cheese that seems to be the new craze. Deeeeelicious. 

Only four stars because I've yet to try anything other than pizza and jalapeno poppers but I will definitely go back to try more!"}
{"text":"We (about 25 of us) happened to stumble across this place. Ish (Owner) was very friendly, welcoming and accommodating considering our large party.  

Everyone ordered a variety of things on the menu and there were no complaints. I actually had the spaghetti and meatballs that came w/ garlic bread - TASTY! 
Then I had plain chicken wings with the house sauce (mild hot sauce which was fi-yah in a great way) on the side. Kids and I ate the wings plain and dipped them in the sauces - both were good. Oh and we tried the bbq flavored ones which were good too! 
Had a slice of philly cheese steak pizza and that just melted in my mouth especially when dipped in the house sauce - DELICIOSO! 

Ish was most kind when we had asked if he could be in our group picture with us since he was so nice. Surprisingly one of the workers said it was his birthday so we sang Happy Birthday to him. His workers got him a cake and he was kind enough to share it w/us. 

Overall eatery experience was  and very affordable. Definitely going to be our \"go to\" place whenever we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious pizza , you will never find a clean and delicious food only in this place yummy"}
{"text":"ordered the double cheese steak.  there may have been 3oz of charred grizzle in the sandwich which was greasy.  the chicken pizza with white sauce and tomatoes was a chopped breaded chicken patty.  The pizza was in editable.  called for delivery .25 miles away...took 1.5 hours.  when I called 45 minutes in, the lady said it was on the truck and hung up on me.  Avoid this train wreck."}
{"text":"Great food, close to the strip and really nice and fast service. My work places is close by I come here often their cheeseburgers are really delicious"}
{"text":"For April 26, 2015- 
Just checked in and left a little review with it! Totally in loooove with the food and the service is just as wonderful! Thanks Moe and the rest of the guys! My family had pizzas, Philly cheesesteaks, spaghetti! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service , was just trying to order pizza for the family when this really rude employee answered and was very unprofessional. He wouldn't even give me basic information without a very bad attitude. I suggest going to flamingo pizza instead they were very professional regardless of the time of the night. Avoid this place rude employees and worse service."}
{"text":"We arrived in late to the Rio hotel where they shut down room service at 11pm. We were hungry but too tired to go out and this was the only place we could find that delivered after midnight. Both the phone delivery people were very friendly and our food arrived in about 45 minutes...which I thought was pretty good. My husband had a hamburger and Hawaiian pizza, which he said were both very good. I had a chicken Parmesan sub that was piping hot and delicious. The fries didn't hold up too well, but the cheesecake made up for that! 

In my 30 years of visiting Vegas, this is the first time I've every ordered delivery, but if I ever need to again, I will call Little Italy!"}
{"text":"I love their food, but hate the service. Every time I call to make an order the man is very rude and I hate it. I still order but seeing as theyre always rude and laugh when I mention something about it makes me want to stop ordering from there. Get better people with actual customer service to work there! Always sound so bitter over the phone."}
{"text":"They slipped a flyer under our door too.  We tried it, but as it was nearby, we went in to the restaurant.  The food was fantastic! I had the philly cheese steak and my wife had the double cheese burger. Both came with fries, hot and crispy as we like them.  The service was fast and friendly and the food delicious, portions ample.  We enjoyed talking with the owner and plan on going back for more before we leave Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Love their pizza. I am a regular and my experience has always been wonderful. And they are Halal ..YES!!"}
{"text":"Updated review based on pizzas

So it pains me to have to update and give it only two stars, but in the past year they've really started using cheap ingredients. 
Positives. 
1.  Service is still great
2. They still have a $9.99 3 topping special 

That's where it stops. I can only give you two stars. The quality of the food is just not good! Your cheese is cheap. Even as hot as can be, no stringy cheese means a sub par pizza. That and bland sauce means that I'll be using the papa Johns online specials vs supporting a local one. 

I bro g the pizza home, not the service."}
{"text":"We had chicken wings with fries and a chicken parm with fries! Mmmmhh. Very good food! The restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly! I would highly recommend this place! And a plus side, they are open late!  The guys that work here are funny and they also got our food out quickly while joking! Nothing better!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and bright. The service was fast & friendly - fantastic. The food was very good and Halal, but a bit greasy. We ordered the lasagna with meat sauce, chicken fingers, and the buffalo chicken pizza. The dough was crisp, the chicken was well cooked. Would've preferred more cheese, so will request extra next time. Son n daughter finished their chicken & lasagna, respectively, and said that they really enjoyed it! Great place for a quick and inexpensive family dinner night."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant writing a review seeing as we never even got the pizza but I figure the world should know our story. I'm staying at a resort off the strip and had a flyer of theirs in my room so I thought I'd give them a chance. I placed an order at 10pm on a Sunday and was quoted a 45 minute delivery time. By about 11 I decided to call and check on how things were going and was told the delivery driver was parking and on our way up to the room and verified the room number with me. 45 MORE minutes later and still no pizza!!! This time when I called I was told I never answered the door (which had mysteriously changed numbers apparently) and it's MY FAULT they 'wasted their time driving 13 miles away to our resort'. 

So here's a bit of advice: don't waste your time with this shitty place!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and very good customer service burger , philly stake and awesome pasta"}
{"text":"Just like everyone else I will never order from this place again.  Mo and the Owner have no integrity and treat their customer's like crap!  This place needs to be shut down and a more reputable REAL ITALIAN pizza place needs to replace them!"}
{"text":"So not worth it. We received our pizza 2 hours after ordering when we were told it would take 45 minutes to an hour to be delivered. So needless to say it was cold. Also, we did not receive our entire order. So suffice it to say I am very unhappy and disappointed in this place. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at the Halal restaurant  \"little Italy pizza\". I would simply say, if your tastebuds know taste of real varied food, than this is the place to go. on my trip to Vegas,i have been there 3 times, and for sure i'll be there in my next trip. Owner and staff were very friendly.  

I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Do not order delivery from this place!  They were an hour late. They forgot our dipping sauces, and the food was cold."}
{"text":"Awesome delivery specials and super friendly staff! We just ordered from them for the second night in a row, and I wouldn't be surprised if we ordered from them a third time. Ordered both nights around 1 AM, and our pizzas arrived hot, on time, and delicious."}
{"text":"Delivery guy was SO beyond rude. Had trouble finding my apartment so I tried talking him through it and he kept cutting me off and not listening to me. We got off the phone and I waited outside for him and he called again still not listening to my directions and STARTED YELLING AT ME saying \"this isn't my job\" \"I don't get paid enough for this\" then When he finally got to me he came out of his car still yelling instead of just apologizing since no customer should EVER be treated like that and giving me my food and leaving. Worst experience ever, last experience with this place ever! Only reason I'm giving it 1 star is because I don't have a choice. Looked at the other terrible reviews for this place And won't even try calling to talk to a manager since it seems like everyone that has tried has gotten yelled at/cussed out/laughed at or lied to."}
{"text":"This place is nasty and the owner and manager \"Mo\" are jerk offs!!!!! i placed order for pizza and chicken wings and both were gross but chicken wings were a lot worse so i called to make complaint. The guy on phone told me what is he supposed to do about it and then when i asked to speak to owner he hung up on me. i called back to speak to owner and when i told him his food was not good he told me f*#@ you and hung up. I would never recommend this place and they have bad business owners."}
{"text":"Great spot to eat good pizza and gorge on wings. I had a cheesesteak and it was what a cheesesteak should be, Cheesy and meaty. Best part: it was all halal. Because I am bound by dietary restriction, I had to find a restaurant where I could eat food fast and halal. I was on a tour around the country and so I had never been to Vegas before. The guys who work in the back of the pizzeria were the owners, and were really cool. Good food, good service, and a place to sit and eat. What more could a brother ask for? Will definitely come back here when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is rated below what it deserves, and if I went with the reviews I wouldn't come and have this wonderful experience.
We usual look for halal food and I was surprised to find this place in Vegas and so close to the strip.
The food quality and portions were more than excellent.. we were a big party and we tried many items and they were all outstanding. 
The service was also excellent they do their maximum to satisfy all of us with all our requests.
Don't miss the burgers - the philly cheese steak - the lasagna and the onion rings they're all so yummy
I recommend this gem to anyone looking for good quality- big portions with reasonable price 
I'll definitely come again & again & again"}
{"text":"I added a picture of how my pizza showed up last night! Absolutely horrible. There's really no excuse for this. I will never order from them again."}

{"text":"Food was okay, make sure to not order out too late or the food will be prepared a little messy; also the portion of fries was not even as expected... taste was good though just order during prime times to ensure better made food !"}
{"text":"Little Italy Pizza was amazing.... I tried the 16 inch pizza for lunch and it was incredible.... I totally want to take my family here for the pizza in the future. I'm so glad I found this place because I've been looking for good fresh food and service."}
{"text":"The pizza is so good here! We got the bbq chicken pizza and the Philly steak pizza and both were delicious. The staff was friendly and the place was clean. They are open till 3 a.m. which is awesome but the best part is that they serve halal meat. Brought the whole family here and there were no complaints!"}
{"text":"I'm getting my car windows tinted at Time 2 Tint and I see this pizza place next door. I got about an hour and a half to kill so I come in and I order an Ice Tea. 

I'm chillin for about 10 mins and I order another ice tea. Someone walks in, I presume the owner because he's telling the workers what to do, another 10 mins pass by and they tell me to order food or get out. I turn around and the owner is making rude gestures at the worker and telling him to tell me to get out. I'm the only person in there. 

I only spent $2 for my 20 mins spent in the restaurant with no one else in there. I had about another hour to kill and was gonna order some pizza next because I was getting hungry at that point. 

This f*cker was rude. Didn't even ask me nicely. I will never come here again. Don't support places like this!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT wings; fried (not baked) - traditional Buffalo style.  Pizza was mediocre meh (canned veggies, ketchup-y sauce).  Turkey sub was fresh roasted Thanksgiving leftover style.  They made a mistake on my sub, and cheerfully acknowledged it without my having to ask them to remake it - which I appreciated.  Nice service staff.  It seems like the bulk of their business is UberEats / Postmates /  Yelp 24/7.  I'd return again, just for the wings and get 2x as many."}
{"text":"I love this place. If you only eat halal food, this place has great food. I love the mushroom burger, philly cheese and turkey sandwich. Pizzas are yummy too! Owner is a delight."}
{"text":"I work close by and have found Little Italy to be very good. Their food is great and the staff always nice and polite. The restaurant is clean as well as the kitchen which is to totally visible.                     Thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and it's halal only thing they need to work on is sauce and maybe offer free ranch?"}
{"text":"I'd rate this place 0 stars if I could. My friend and I were originally going to eat at Pho Bosa which is next door. For some reason, they were closed. We decided to check this place out. The place was empty except for one lady behind the counter and one elderly man in front of us who was still deciding on what to order and complaining that they didn't serve beer. Place smelled a little ripe. I guess they also serve Halal food.

Okay, we're hungry, whatever; let's do this.

Well, we were discussing splitting a pizza when my friend asked to the lady behind the counter, \"How long does a pizza usually take (to cook)?\" as we were on a lunch break.

She replied (rudely), \"You want me to rush?\"

Wow, not off to a great start, lady. I then explained we were on lunch.

She said, \"10 minutes.\"

Okay.

There wasn't a clear Pepperoni Pizza option on their above menu, and that's all we wanted: the most normal pizza order in the world. She had asked what size pizza we wanted as they had 3 options, and I asked if their 14\" Small Pizza was big enough for two people.

She said, \"NO!\" pointed the larger box (which we couldn't clearly finish between the both of us).

So, instead of her rude \"recommendation,\" I told her that we'd like a small pepperoni -- the one we were asking about in the first place.

\"........... -_- Anything else?\"

\"Sure, a couple of Cokes.\"

\"How many?! 1, 2, 3, 4...!!??\"

I don't usually leave restaurants, but I didn't even have to think twice about walking out here.

I couldn't tell you about how the food might've been. I typically don't like to dine at places operated by cold, bitter people.

Don't waste your time. They can't even be nice to customers. It's one of those places where you ask yourself, \"How is this place open?\" That's never a good sign.

2 thumbs down."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Vagas , great pizza , burgers subs and pasta! At great prices , must try! Thanks for the great friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Was really hungry with the family after a long day of walking around the Strip. Found out this halal pizza joint. The quality and portions of this place was excellent. They have a nice array of toppings for their pizza. Expect to pay about $10 per person. This is a good deal for the strip. 

We ordered the steak n cheese which was phenomenal. Then we had the buffalo pizza chicken and supreme pizza which had great texture, zingy tomato sauce, and crunchy crust. 

They cook everything in a made to order fashion which is why this place is so good. 

This is a wonderful place that is down to earth and made us return twice! 

Thank you Little Italy Pizza!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza that I've ever had, I'm so glad that I ordered from them, when I come to Vegas next time I will order from them again."}
{"text":"This place is not worth ordering from! We ordered a supreme thinking how can we go wrong with it... Well we got the pizza and it looked like the ingredients were tossed on the pizza after it came out of the oven. There was not enough cheese and it tasted like tomato sauce on dough with some veggies. 

The service was also horrible! We ordered delivery after receiving a flyer under our resort room door. When the driver delivered our pizza he told us we were supposed to order Parmesan cheese and crushed peppers when placing the order. When delivering to a hotel/resort that should be necessary to have some handy, especially when we mention we are staying in a hotel/resort when placing the order! 

When I called to complain about the pizza and mention the lack of cheese and peppers I had to repeat my complaint to two different people! I'm assuming the manager was the last to speak with me and he was very very rude!! Telling me that they normally don't automatically have cheese and peppers on hand because we were staying at the grand view \"resort\" which are like furnished condos. Any hotel is like a furnished condo, you idiot!! A resort does not differ from a hotel in any way other than their reservations and fees. This guy assumed a resort also meant full stocked fridge and pantry in order to save money on having a driver always carry peppers and cheese??? 

Not to mention, the complaint about the pizza was also not taken lightly! I was told I was the first person to complain about their food in 20 years!! Maybe because their customers are normally already drunk by the time they get their pizza late night and it makes no difference to them. This guy then proceeded to tell me that I could call back in the morning to repeat my complaint to their day manager. I ordered our pizza at 830pm, what good is calling the next morning going to do for our disgusting dinner!! I was told they would not send a driver out 30 miles to deliver us a better pizza. Um, Did he not realize that I could google them and see they were only 8 miles away! And even if they were that far, why would they advertise under our door if they were not willing to drive to us! I have never had such horrible service or food!!

I guess Little Italy Pizza doesn't care about customer service or customer retention because they market to the hotels and resorts which contain people that are only here for a few days at a time! Very very disappointed with this place, if I could I would have flyers placed under each resort/hotel door with this review of them. 

I would definitely suggest Rosati's Pizza instead! They aren't open late night but if you're looking for a decent pizza dinner on vacation I would suggest Rosati's. Save Little Italy Pizza for your drunken nights If you absolutely don't have any other choice."}
{"text":"got the bbq chicken specialty  pizza. it arrived hot and was great. fast delivery and friendly service. a good pizza option in lv for delivery."}
{"text":"Open late, fast, friendly, cheap pizza, wings, hot sandwiches. Halal place in China town."}
{"text":"This place was really good. The staff was very kind and helpful. I recommend this place if you're looking for a pizza in Vegas."}
{"text":"This one of my favorite burger places. All items are halal. The double cheeseburgers with turkey bacon is to die for. Pizza is nice too. Location and atmosphere is not particularly the best, but they deliver."}
{"text":"Great cheeseburger and buffalo chicken pizza!  Very friendly staff.  Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Chicken salad is bomb , gyros sandwich is finger licking good , good people , nice place , will definitely  come back !!!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza my fiance and I have ever had. Today was our first and last time ever visiting. The pizza had no flavor and there's barely any toppings. I've had store bought frozen pizza that has tasted ten times better. This place has no idea how to make pizza worth humans eating."}
{"text":"Good chicken burger but the Philly Stake was amazing ... place is located in a modest area .. I am glad I went.. great service ... friendly people."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST ITALIAN FOOD IVE EVER HAD!!!!! I was so hungover from a long night & upon stumbling into this glorious establishment, I was pleased beyond belief! I had the spaghetti with red sauce, breadsticks, and my girlfriend had the philly cheese steak. I can't even describe how good the food was! The best part is that the owner told us it was made with love & we were the only people dining at the time so it was made with A LOT OF LOVE!! Just the way we like it. Also the homeless regulars add a nice touch of entertainment. Can't go wrong with little italy!!! :-)"}
{"text":"The food was great and the staff were so friendly and helpful. It is highly recommended place to eat. We were party of adults and kids, the variety of food they have met the preferences of all. Thank you little Italy pizza...."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good halal place that had something for everyone. We ordered cheese pizza and supreme pizza which the kids liked watching them roll out and freshly toss. The pizza was so quick and fresh with halal pepperoni and beef and fresh green peppers and onion. The smell was enough to tell you that it was going to be really good which the first bite only confirmed. We ordered two double burgers and hamburger and cheeseburger which were equally yummy. Juicy burgers dropping with mayo and ketchup and all the trimmings. My little 5 yr old ate a whole six slice cheese pizza saying it was the best pizza he's ever had. The tomato sauce is perfect not a tangy or avidly sauce at all. Just perfect. I will be back to try chicken burger and philly sandwich. Those look amazing as well. The guys behind the counter were so sweet and amazing at making the meal hot and quick.my husband is Pakistani and I'm American and this was amazing place to eat at."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Las Vegas you need to come here when you're hungry because the food is very good... Halal food... Halal pepperoni... Halal bacon... Give them a try they deliver!"}
{"text":"I love little itally ... pssh ... if u don't like this pizza ...ur freakin crazy !!!! I think this is some of the best dam pizza I've ever had ! Been comin her more then a year!!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly guys in there. The food is pretty good. And their pizza is actually not bad for the price. It's close to where I work, and they are open really late. They still have a $9.99 large special for locals only. But you have to ask for it."}
{"text":"I have been a Las Vegas local for the past 5 years and this is the ONLY place that I prefer to get pizza from. It is freshly made, the people are friendly and the prices are reasonable. If you are looking for great pizza, this is the place to order from."}
{"text":"Best pizza behind Vegas strip, this is always our go to pizza when we are in town 

Pizza made to perfection not to greasy made just right 
Large pizza is enough for 2 (3 if you have a kid )

Cheers from Long Beach,CA"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger joint. I ordered on the phone bc I was so hungry and I didn't want to wait. We ended up missing our exit and got there about 10-15 mins late. They remade my food without even asking. Their burger was good, Philly cheesesteak was ok. I'd def recommend trying their burger. Good food and good service."}
{"text":"Great resturant with great food and staff , with a wide variety of options , must try !"}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall place. Pizzas and sandwiches all were great. Definitely deserves a revisit."}
{"text":"Best pizza in vegas. Their meat lover is really delicious. 100% Halal. Nice staff. Gave us complimentry drinks."}
{"text":"We ordered lasagna and chicken straps with fries and sprite. When we opened up the tale out box, there was no sprite. And on top of that,  the lasagna was spaghetti instead.  Horrible tasting on both and child as well.  Don't eat.  We ended up getting another meal at a place nearby."}
{"text":"My family and I walked into this place looking for a halal joint to dine in. The servers were incredibly nice and the food was delicious. The server was also the cook and he was polite regardless the fact that we showed up at 10:30 pm. The food was delicious and the wait time was not that bad. A good place, reccomend it for everyone"}
{"text":"Came in for pizza but they don't sell it by the slice so I got the cheeseburger instead. Food came out hot and fresh. Service was fast. The ladies were extremely friendly. I will be returning"}
{"text":"First of all my delivery driver was rude. He claims he called me but after showing him my call log he shut up. My onion rings came cold and mushy. My pizza was also burnt. Never ordering pizza from here again. What a waste of $40 bucks."}
{"text":"Cleanest restaurant I've ever set foot in! The staff was extremely nice too! The current Yelp rating does not do this restaurant justice. The food is solid and wait time was not too long. We ordered an 18\" half Meat Lovers-half White Garlic Chicken and 16\" Philly Steak Pizza. The dough was soft, gooey and fluffy in both, and the cheese, toppings, etc. were amazing in quality. Definitely recommend this place if you're in Vegas and looking for a Halal (or just a general) pizza place!"}
{"text":"Wow! The pizza was amazing and hand made. Probably one of the few times I actually saw the dough being made and prepared fresh. The cheese was melty and Perfect.

Service was top notch too, the man behind the counter was friendly and I could tell he really enjoyed making pizzas. He was more excited about it than I was. Great place."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to grab a to go lunch. It is right down the street from my office. I went and the staff was nice and I ordered chicken fingers and fries. It took about 10 minutes and the food was good. It is not my first choice but definitely a place of you are in a hurry and want grab something quick in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered three 13in pizzas & 48 wings & was ready in time and tasted great. Liked the fact that it was open till midnight for the late night cravings."}
{"text":"Horrible service, just called to place an order and whoever I spoke to was really rude. I asked if they had any specials and he replied \"it's too late to have specials\". So does that mean you have specials during the day but not at night? And to top it all off I got hung up on. Well what ever I won't ever be eating there."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but the hire the WORST people and I'm finally done. We order from them almost once a week. A few days ago we called to order our regular but instead of normal $35 it always is the guy said $50. My husband laughed knowing that's not the usual price and the guy got aggressive and said why are you laughing. We were still willing to pay his price but then cursed my husband out on the phone. He sounded like he's from s different country and we have honestly had enough. You had great pizza you made about 150 s month off of us. Never again after the disrespect. The guy even said he was the owner at 2am. Yeah sure the owner knows you're trying to rob his regular clients. Very stupid."}
{"text":"Eh.........................................

Definitely had better. Apparently the chicken is good but pizza is below average."}
{"text":"Just had a terrible, terrible experience at this place. I ordered a Philly Cheese steak, and the girl who took my order was very pleasant. While I was waiting, I got a phone call and needed to write down some information. I asked the girl if I could write on an order pad, but she didn't hear me because she was in the back of the kitchen making my food. I went ahead and did it, and when she came back up she had a horrified look on her face, and said that her manager would get upset because all the pages on the order pad have an order number on them, and if one was missing he would accuse her of stealing. So she had to take the note back into the office to show him and clear it with him. I heard some harsh words from her manager (who, as it turns out, is her father), and when she came out, she was crying. I felt terrible, so I walked back into the office to tell her manager/father that it was my fault, not hers. He said he understood and asked me to leave the office. He followed me out, and proceeded to very harshly reprimand the girl for doing absolutely NOTHING wrong. I told him that his behavior was extremely unnecessary and inappropriate, and that he should be ashamed of himself for treating that poor girl so terribly. He was a complete bully, totally humiliated her in front of me, made her cry, and told her to call her mother to come pick her up. I'm not one to intervene in family matters, but this man was a mean, miserable, unmitigated scum bag. I will never, ever give this place my business again. I feel very sorry for his employees."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever called to ask if he could deliver to our hotel and he said no that if we wanted delivery we would have to meet him at the gas station by our hotel. I told him we would tell our gate security to let him in since the previous night we had delivery as well and there was no issue.he when on interrupting me and was extremely rude and before I was even able to let him know we will pick up he hanged up. We called again and he hanged up on us again. I will never try this place and I will be telling everyone I know of how bad of service you get here."}
{"text":"Does Not honor Yelp discount beware!

I generally Dont like to give negative reviews. So i'll leave this open ended. Business for them seems good. my experience was alright..."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience with this place.  Rude management and the worst service.   Go elsewhere.  Plenty of better options in town."}
{"text":"I tried their Chicken Burger and it was the best thing ever. My friend also tried their cheeseburger and he said it was delicious. If you're in Vegas, you should go there. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Tried Little Italy for the first time last weekend. We were meeting lots of family members in our suite at Vdara and this place conveniently delivered. 

Realizing that they serve halal food, we ordered a meat lovers pizza and a supreme pizza that has meat and veggies. They are super generous with their toppings and the quality of the ingredients totally shines through. Cheese was oooey gooeeey, but we all commented that the crust could have been a little crispier. Still really good overall though. 

Two large pizzas and a bottle of sprite cost about $50 with delivery fee and tip. 

Fair prices, tasty pizzas, and quick delivery - Littly Italy did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Don't ever order food from this place!! Wow I was at the Forum shops we are two lights away from this place on Twain... Took"}
{"text":"Called for a delivery, they arrived within the time given 45min to an hour (took an hour). The guy tat took our order and the one that delivered it were nice and friendly, no problem finding our hotel room. The only reason for 2 stars is the quality of the pizza. We ordered a white garlic chicken pizza and added mushroom with no onions: the chicken was very dried out and hard (think beef jerky texture), it smelled good but tasted just ok, mushrooms tasted like canned and were not good, the pizza arrived cold and the delivery person didn't look like he had a thermal bag like the one most pizza companies use to keep it warm during transit. The pepperoni pizza was cold, bland, and the pepperoni s themselves looked different than any I've ever seen or had before and it tasted off like it was vegetarian or missing that pepperoni taste. Other than the food taste and the cost ($36 for 2 small pizzas) the people were nice but Sadly I can't give beyond 2 stars for good service and bad tasting food."}
{"text":"If you stayed at Circus Circus Casino and Resort then you have probably come across one those pizzeria that slips ads into your door. However, do not fall into the trap of ordering from them like I did!

We ordered the party pack which consist of a large pizza with 2 toppings of choice and a half bucket of buffalos wings or fingers. We paid $40 total, $5 of which is delivery charge and the other $5 is tip. The pizza came with hardly any toppings at all and it was uncut... Yes you heard me right, $5 tip and they did not even cut the pizza for us. We asked for cheese and peppers and they gave 2 packs, one cheese and one pepper. By now, the wings should at least be decent. No, it tasted like frozen Walmart wings. The delivery guy even had the nerve to make me come down to pick it up instead of coming up to my room."}
{"text":"This place has flavourful meat.  We arrived at 11pm and ordered a philly cheese steak/meat lovers pizza and a beef cheeseburger.  Everything was delicious, hot, and fresh.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Messed up my topping and still got charged $22 for a pick up pizza smh"}
