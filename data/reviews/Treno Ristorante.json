{"text":"The food was good. However, we won't be back.  Why?  The restaurant remodel with open brick and nice chandeliers while nice looking is best described as cavernous. The result is one of the noisiest restaurants we've ever been in. Sound travels, especially from larger groups across the entire restaurant. We could not have a conversation with each other and enjoy our meal. If you need to have a personal conversation  or discuss business--stay away from this restaurant. Even speaking to the waitress to order was difficult. Ruined the evening for us.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great Italian flavor. We had the meatballs as an appetizer. Sauce was delicious.  We used it to dip the bread in. The side salads were very good with a balsamic dressing. We both had the shrimp aglio oleo, which we both enjoyed.  Service was good, too. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"I'm anything but happy with our visit here. We didn't have a reservation and accepted waiting in the bar. Should supposedly take 20-25 minutes. We got a table after over an hour and a few remainders. Our waitress didn't know anything about the menu. On the upside the dishes was very big and the menu had many items that seemed nice. However, the dishes was unbalanced and my veal was cooked dry so I had a lot higher expectations looking at the price range and the image they were going for."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant that we have been to twice now.  Both times we have sat at the bar and had great service from the bartender and the food has been a welcome surprise to the Kent dining scene.  Food and service are both 5 

The reason for my review rating is due to either the owner or manger that walked up to the bar, barking orders and talking down to the bartender like she was so beneath him.  Never once did he acknowledge us and was too concerned about not having to answer the phones or know why there were samples from the local beer distributor on the bar.  If you are going to treat your staff like shit, especially right in front of customers, you won't be getting our business again."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Luved the atmosphere. Very classy with great selections of wines and food. Everyone was very nice and friendly. Excellent choice for very authentic Italian cuisine. Thanks to Greg and Kyle for the great service. Would highly recommend this place. 
Thx

{"text":"Second time here. Second time great. We went DOUBLE calamari appetizer, which we already knew was fantastic. It was doubly fantastic. All of our entrees were great. I went Chicken Marsala this time and it might have overtaken the Carbonara last time as my new favorite. Everyone else loved their food.

And, more importantly, we ended up with the same sever as last time, Renee. She is BY FAR our favorite server anywhere we have ever gone. She was fantastic the 1st time. She was more fantastic the 2nd time. Even though we love the food across the board, it may be a prerequisite that she be our server upon subsequent visits.

2 for 2. We look forward to our 3rd, 4th, 5th...visits, ad infinitum."}
{"text":"I ate there last night and I wasn't too impressed with the quality vs price. I had the risotto and my girlfriend had the signature spaghetti. My risotto tasted very bland with no distinct flavor. For a $19 entree I was unimpressed. The spaghetti tasted just like any other spaghetti and meatballs I have had. Nothing really made the food stand out to justify the costs. 

Also, I did not think that their wine selection was very diverse. I found it difficult to find something that would pair well with my meal. 

The service was fine. Not much to complain about other than the server asked if I needed any parmesan, black pepper, etc. and I requested some black pepper and never got any. 

Overall, I would hesitate on dining here again. I think I can get much more bold flavors at Laziza, Bricco, or Bistro on Main."}
{"text":"Food was forgettable, table placement for guests who made reservations was insulting followed up by the constant wonder if any of the staff who've lapped our table multiple times might ever do something as simple as refill our glasses. The remodel of the inside is very nice but you need more than that to keep business."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to going here! Let me start with the positives: the space is great and the service was excellent! This is the former location of the Pufferbelly in downtown Kent. Nicely remodelled and featuring \"Upscale Italian cuisine\". I'm nor sure what that means as very liitle of the food that our table ordered came out tasting very \"Italian\" . I had the veal parmasan, a very thick piece of veal (clearly not pounded as most restaurants prepare it, and overcooked), a very small amount of \"sauce\" that was not flavorful, over pasta that was plentifull, but overcooked and lukewarm. My dinner compainion had the veal marsala, which was also a very thick cut of veal (not pounded and thin as it should be, and also overcooked). Her sauce was so far away from a true \"marsala\" sauce that we were very baffled. It came with a creamy sauce and perhaps a hint of Marsala wine. I say \"hint\" because it was so buried in the cream sauce. When I said that the service was excellent, the owner/manager corrected a few issues that our dinner guests had: a gin and tonic with what appeared to be soda water and a ciopinno with no toast slices to use for dipping as described in the menu. (Both issues remedied quickly)
Also, our server, Amanda. was excellent and very attentive on such a busy night. Will we be back? Most likely, as I think they are still finding their way. Maybe calling it \"Upscale Italian\", as they do on their website, is setting the taste \"bar\" too high."}
{"text":"What a change from the old restaurant!  It now has an upscale look.  We sat in a booth on the bar side and it didn't seem to be as noisy as others have said.  We had the linguine with clams and spaghetti with meatballs.   We also had lemon cake and a brownie for dessert (they were out of cannoli's).  Everything was delicious.  The service was very good from busboys to waitress.  We were celebrating a special occasion and it was a very pleasant evening.  We had two wines and two beers and the total was about $85.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I came here the other night curious about this restaurant, having been here many times when it was the Pufferbelly. Not sure if I'll be back. The previous reviews about the noise level are all true, it is difficult to have a decent conversation because it is so loud. Not loud music, it's just loud with conversation because the acoustics are bad. The service is good, but the food is not that great. I had linguine with clams, something any Italian restaurant should do well. The sauce was watery and bland. There are many gluten free choices, but it is very pricy. $23 for a small plate of pasta is too much. It did come with salad, but the house dressing is not great, and they do not offer any other choices. Hopefully when they've been in business for a while longer there will be improvements."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Treno, located in the 1875 Erie Lackawanna rail depot building in Kent.

I had Chicken Parm with fresh mozzarella and it was to die for.  Bread was wonderful as was the pasta and sauce.  My wife had a large salad which looked great and she raved about.

I'm a history and railroad nerd and I'm so happy another restaurant, an upscale Italian one to boot, found home in this beautiful building.

We had Haley as a server and she was friendly and efficient.

We look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I just wrote a long review and apparently lost it, so here's my repost:

Treno:  looks pretty, friendly staff.  Linguine con Vongole:  Pasta should be married to its sauce and warmed before serving, not preset in a bowl to congeal and have its sauce and clams dumped on top.  The strips of roasted red peppers (aka canned pimiento) are too large and contribute nothing to the flavor while the parsley is too sparse.  The crusty bread was too cold and stale to sop up the lukewarm sauce left in the bowl.  The sorbet was too sweet.  The soup is too hearty to be a starter.

My vegetarian friend's beet salad did not come with the dressing on the side as requested, and no, when she asks if it is truly vegetarian she does not want to add chicken or salmon to it.

My first posting, which I lost, was kinder and gentler, but this is a true, albeit curt, review.

I would try Treno again, with some caution."}
{"text":"Great place to try some amazing food you wouldn't typically find in the area, but also an awesome bar to sit and try handmade fresh cocktails."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I heard the site of the former Pufferbelly was undergoing renovations to restore the train depot and host a new fine dining restaurant - even moreso with an Italian-themed menu.

We made reservations at Treno for a Friday night (on their second weekend open, mind you) and got in at 8pm. We arrived and were greeted by a super nice hostess who welcomed us and pointed out some of the renovations: restoration of the original tile floors and using wood from the former bar to create a barn door that decorates a back wall. And I have to say the interior does look lovely and quite fancified with hanging rod iron lantern lighting and dark wood trimmings! 

We were promptly seated and greeted by our waiter. Beer was very reasonably priced ($4 for a pint of Rhinegeist) and they had a good selection. (Next time I'll have to try a wine!) The menu had a nice selection of items including pasta, seafood, steak, etc. and had an overall feel that will be very familiar to you if you go to Laziza, one of the owner's other Kent restaurants. 

We ordered a meat and cheese tray to start and it was really nice for sharing with salami, capicola, a variety of cheese (I couldn't identify all the cheese), crostini, and delicious fresh blueberry and strawberry. They also brought us some very tasty foccacia with a divine oil and balsamic herbed dip. I could just eat that all day! 

I ordered Bolognese, one of my favorites, and the fella got chicken marsala. My Bolognese was very delicious but not exactly Bolognese. It had a very delicious tomato based sauce, yes, but the meat was braised beef tips strewn throughout the dish rather than the traditional chunky meat sauce. It was good, and not everything has to be traditional preparation, but I thought it was a tad odd. The noodles were a wide long and flat variety and cooked perfectly which I really appreciated.

Overall, my meal was very good and service was great! The removal of most booths and walls to the one side of the building does class up the joint but it can also be quite loud with no noise absorption methods. There is a new lovely bar to the right with limited seating (maybe up to 20 people) and a few booths on that side. I guess there's a Ben Curtis room in honor of it's co-owner/KSU alum who won the British open but I didn't notice that if I passed by it. 

Good things are happening here and I definitely want to go back sometime to try a different dish. I think I'm in luck as there were many on the menu that sounded fabulous!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Nice atmosphere- dim lighting, comfy booth, no obnoxious music. Delicious meatball appetizer. Sausage and spinach soup was just like homemade. Perfect pasta entrees with just the right amount of sauce. Raspberry gelato to end the meal made us satisfied but not overly stuffed. We'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"They kept the spirit of the old Pufferbelly alive, but carved out its own niche. Like I've read on a couple reviews, the only problem is the sound. It was reservations only and every seat was taken, which is a good thing, but it was pretty loud. I know they'll figure something out.

The service was great. Our waitress was very attentive and although it was packed, we didn't feel like it was slow. The owner also made his presence felt which is always a nice touch. For it still being in the soft opening stage, I was pretty impressed with that end of things. 

I saw a bad review of the skirt steak on here. Well, they fixed whatever was wrong with it. The server was very upfront about that. I didn't order it, but was soooo jealous of the person at our table that did. Had a bite, it was delicious. 

The white balsamic dressing on the salad is the best dressing I've ever had. I was mopping up what was left with my finger. 

Calamari was great. Olives, herbs, nuts, tomatoes and a good sauce on it make it different than what I'm used to with calamari, in a good way. 

It is pricey, but the ambiance, service, and quality of the food make it worth it for special occasions. We'll probably come back."}
{"text":"Everyone at our table was sort of underwhelmed by their meals.  Except for those who got the chicken parm. One of the best I've had... super crispy with fresh pasta.  The appetizer focaccia bread didn't pair well with the oil they put out... the bread was already oily. I would suggest a softer bread that will soak the flavor of the dipping oil better.  
Atmosphere is great. I love the building."}
{"text":"Great service excellent food . Great wine .selection . Had a great experience there. I will return Joel are waiter was very honest about all the dishes ."}
{"text":"Tried Treno for the first time last night and was very impressed. Went in for just drinks and ended up having some food as well.

Drinks: friend and I got the martinis- they were very well made, the glassware is quality, the bartender was exceptionally nice. They are a tad smaller than a Bricco martini, but the price is about the same give or take a buck. Definitely worth it for a good martini. I was a little disappointed they didn't have an espresso martini on the menu, but did make that suggestion. An Italian espresso martini would be a great addition.

Bread- their fresh bread was outstanding! Crisp outside, soft inside, perfect amount of seasoning, and the olive oil/balsamic mix was perfect!

Apps- tried the stuffed peppers and was not disappointed! A little bit of spice, but not overbearing, perfectly cooked, and good sauce. You could just tell that things aren't just frozen and reheated. Would definitely get them again.

Dessert- I don't know about the rest of you, but I judge an Italian place based on their cannoli... and Treno gets an A! You get two cannolis served on a plate of what I believe was crumbled pistachios. Bottom half of the shell is dipped in chocolate. They make the filling in house and it's outstanding! Sweet, but not too sweet. Most importantly, the shell was crisp all the way through and not soggy at all. I very much enjoyed them.

Overall- atmosphere and decor are elegant and classy. Service was great, food and drinks were great. Price was on the high end but served a purpose as it allows them to purchase high quality ingredients and also maintains a higher level clientele, and keeps the trashy away.

I would absolutely recommend Treno."}
{"text":"Saturday nite.   Supposed to be an Italian restaurant.  No cannoli in house.   Plus a less than friendly rather condescending bartender.  No thanks."}
{"text":"Took my buddy and 4 others here for his bachelor party dinner. Not a single one of us got the same thing and we all were happy with our meals. I got the clams and pasta, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The service from our waitress, Mellisa, was excellent. Price was on point for the quality of food and service. Make a reservation you won't regret it."}
{"text":"When Pufferbelly left, of course we were upset, but we were excited to hear something new would be going in!  First and foremost.... You need reservations for dinner.    I'm so glad I got into the habit of calling new places first to find out if reservations are needed and dress code.  Some places can be sticklers.

I noticed and loved the remodel right away.  It's more open and has a friendly, countryside atmosphere.

I loved the food here, but I cannot give it 5 stars.  I understand that they are in the middle of their \"soft\" opening, but some things can't slide.  With their strict code of reservations, I expected to at least see their hostesses in proper attire.  NO!  and that was just awful in my book.  If you require reservations, bill yourself as high class, then your hostesses should be dressed for the part.  NOT YOGA PANTS AND THONG SANDALS!!!!  I expect business attire.  AT A MININUM!!!!  Khakis, dress slacks, nice skirt, blouse, dress.... NOT STRETCHY EXERCISE PANTS!!!!!  Jeggings and leggings are a NO as well!!!  Other than that, they were very friendly and fast.  Hubby and I were seated promptly.

Our waiter was fast, friendly, and knowledgeable.  Drink orders were taken promptly and I never had to ask for refills on my water.  The Lemoncello is to die for!  Very well done.  We ordered the calamari appetizer and it was very good.  Crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  The flavors danced on our tongue.  I will definitely order that again!  My main course was a dish made with Angel Hair pasta, shrimp and Olive Oil.  It came out hot and looked fabulous!!!  It tasted even better!  I am very impressed with the food.

Unfortunately, I was VERY disappointed with dessert.  They had 3 pumpkin items to choose from and a few other desserts, yet was out of Tiramisu.  So sad....  I hate pumpkin.  I did not want any of the other desserts.  I did not have dessert.  Their cannolis were just OK.  I was not impressed.  Worst off, there was an ant on our dessert plate.  :::sigh:::  I had high hopes.

Overall, 2 alcoholic drinks, 1 appetizer, 2 main meals, 1 dessert + tip came to over $100.  Yes, I'll go here again, but not for dinner.  I will stick with lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent and friendly service! The lunch menu is a perfect portion size, the caldo Italiano and the grilled cheese are absolutely delicious! The atmosphere is wonderful, high ceilings and exposed brick really accentuate the old train depot and history in the building. One of my favorite dishes on the dinner menu is the chicken Marsala! The chef does an amazing job, you can tell all the sauces are fresh and housemade! 
Don't even get me started on the wine list and cocktails, my favorites are the treno old fashioned and the pera flora. Will definitely be returning for date nights and happy hour."}
{"text":"First off, the remodel gives new life to the place by blending both a contemporary yet rustic look, to create a casual but stylish atmosphere. It feels trendy and urban, similar to something that would be in the big city! The Italian cuisine did not disappoint! The stuffed banana peppers and calamari were some of the best I've had. The bolognese and chicken parm were  equally delicious. I highly recommend this new restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last night for dinner. Overall everything was excellent. My wife had the lasagna and I had the chicken Parmesan. Both were absolutely delicious. The food tasted like it was made very much from scratch with fresh ingredients. I see another review mention it lacked flavor, which I couldn't disagree with more. The freshness almost gave it a bit of a \"healthier\" taste. I had a Sicilian Mule mixed drink which was also perfect. The reason I gave a 4 Star is because our food came out before our salads. Normally this would be a huge pet peeve, however the food came out FAST and was super hot, so by the time they got the salad and I ate it, my food had a chance to cook. The manager/owner? must have noticed, and he also came over and apologized, despite me not really mentioning anything about it. We will absolutely be going back, and again, aside from the salad issue, it would be a very easy 5 star experience."}
{"text":"We ate at Treno a couple weeks after it opened. The food and service were excellent. I had the spaghetti and meatballs-perfect! Highly recommend!"}
