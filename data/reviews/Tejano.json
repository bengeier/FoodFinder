{"text":"Lies. This \"upscalish\" restaurant lied to me about accepting American Express cards. They have a contract with AmEx clearly stipulating that they should not discriminate against AmEx cards in favour of other payment methods, but when I tried to pay for my order using an AmEx card they refused to take it, claiming that they accept the card only for some special orders. This is contrary to the fact that AmEx confirmed to me that the restaurant should accept their cards https://maps.americanexpress.com/ca/cards-welcome/name=TEJANO-BBQ-BURRITO/mid=9434100743?lang=en-US  Otherwise, the Burritos tend to fall in ruins, they should better  \"tightened\""}
{"text":"We were in town to pick up my son who was finishing up his first year of university. No one felt like going out and we decided to order from Tejano (Uber Eats). It was excellent. A very interesting take on burritos; loved the Texas infusion without being a gloppy Tex Mex mess.Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Their portions and services change every time i go.... Sometimes the burrito is big... sometimes its super small... Also workers can be friendly and rude... it really depends on when you go. also their ingredient quality varies too. few times.... i wanted to leave the store bc the ingredients look horrible. but then other days its fresh. so I pray every time I go it is fresh and hope the worker is nice and give me nice portion. or I just look thru the window and if the worker looks mean.... I dont go... plenty of other good places to eat."}
{"text":"Best burrito in Montreal, plain and simple. You can either hit chicken, beef or port. It may sound simple but trust me, all you need is right in there!  Service can be a bit slow during lunch time but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We were looking for something like burritos and saw this place was nearby so we went in. Great staff. Friendly and helpful. Fun toppings to make it your own. Kind of like chipotle but a little more local feeling. The burritos were good. The quest fresco was tasty. I'd go back."}
{"text":"We order from their catering menu and what is better than eating soft tacos? It's being able to make them yourself!!!   The only problem is that the stuffing is so good that the wraps are never big enough.   The chicken and pulled pork are 100% yum.  You absolutely MUST top with the pickled onions!!! It really adds an extra dimension to your taco. Their chips are very crispy, thick cut and pretty addictive with the guacamole. Tostitos got nothing on them!"}
{"text":"As an American, I'm on a constant quest to find something that feels like Chipotle in Montreal. This isn't really it, but it's close to my work and super tasty. The meat is well done (I've gotten beef and pork) and I like that they have the option to add queso fresco (although it costs extra) and pickled onions which isn't common for American tex-mex places.   I always get the bowl and the portion is good. A tad bit smaller than chipotle's. I'm generally pretty full after eating here. The location itself doesn't have a lot of seating inside, just a few chairs along a tall bar that you can eat at. Generally we pick up our food and take it to go.   Docking a star because it's pretty pricey for being a tex-mex place (I think my bowl is normally around $15.) I know it's trying to be fancy and more local-feeling, but since I eat here for work lunch it's generally competing with other places that are around $10 for lunch."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try Tejano for a while because of my love for its older brother, Blackstrap BBQ, and because I do enjoy the Chipotle-style burritos.  I have to say, Tejano delivered a solid burrito, and much to my delight, their options are more creative than Chipotle and it's local copycat, M4.   The meat is better, the ingredients fresh, and they are not just your standard grilled veggies. I had the beef and chipotle salsa - it was nicely spicy.  I really enjoyed the queso fresco and the south-west slaw, it adds a very nice touch.  It's a shame that it's not in a super convenient location because I would go more regularly. I would say that it is definitely a better option that comparable restaurants in the region."}
