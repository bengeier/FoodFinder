{"text":"I just love sushi so I'm biased when it comes to sushi restaurants, however, Oyshi Sushi is my new fave in town! Ambiance is beautiful - they have a big Japanese mural in their private room ~ so lovely to look at.  Service is excellent ~ food is delicious ~ price is reasonable.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Many better sushi places downtown. Oyshi service is to be desired, food is decent but always gives me the trots afterward. I only go there if everyone else is, too many better places around."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this little family run sushi joint on the coldest night of the year before a leaf game. The green tea and Miso soup was some the best I've ever had. The small private booths were wonderful and cosy.  The sushi & maki was fresh and yummy. Service was friendly warm and relaxed/comfortable yet traditional.  Wouldn't hesitate to return....the leafs stunk out the rink the sushi was the highlight of the night"}
{"text":"Starting to become fond of this place. Always treated with great service, and great food! Spicy Tuna Roll is one you cant miss out on! And there pot stickers have a unique taste, and this really mind blowing with the sauce!"}
{"text":"It was alright. Still think YAMA sushi is the best. Too many rules here. Didn't like how there's a limit on baked mussels and desserts!!!! And how you can't order half rolls. There ahi poke salad sucked and barely had any fish in it. Most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"The service was very good, and fast. But I did have a problem with the menu being dirty the pages where sticky and  had some dried peaces of food and so was the table."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe and energy of the restaurant. Was really busy when I went but we didn't wait long for our food and drinks. Food was coming out fast and steady. The Cajun albacore is a must have. The menu is very diverse, there is something for everyone. I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"We came here at the recommendation of a friend who lives in Vegas after mentioning wanting to go to Nobu for dinner. (I'm from NY and like the Nobu location there). The decor is adequate, but the music was really odd for a restaurant: one of the first songs we heard was about eating pussy and there were many songs with the n word. I expect that while I'm at the club, but while I'm eating? Completely tasteless!   The service was lacking but not the worst I've seen. At one point the waitress came over to check the amount of wine left in the bottle, then set it down and walked away even though two of our glasses were empty! The food came out very slowly, but that's typical of an all-you-can-eat place, where they want you to fill up in between courses and order less.   The food itself was extremely disappointing. Most of the rolls had ingredients that are never in real sushi: cream cheese, cheddar cheese, and other odd things. They were presented attractively but were drenched in cream sauces and the ones that were fried were disgustingly greasy. The fish was fresh enough but not even close to the quality I'm used to.   I guess if you've never had really high quality sushi you might enjoy this place (judging from other reviewers) but if you appreciate only the best sushi, you'll probably want to skip Oyshi. I definitely won't go back!"}
{"text":"\"Oyshi\" is Japanese for \"delicious\" and indeed, this place is delicious. I used to work nearby and this place would be my default dinner spot when I was too tired to really \"go out\" on the town. The food is fresh and the prices are reasonable. Service is excellent.   I've never had anything there that I did not enjoy. The atmosphere is nice for a date. They also have a great all-you-can-eat for a set price which includes everything on the menu except for the sashimi.   Maybe I'm sentimental, but now that I don't live in the area anymore, I sometimes find myself craving the sushi here.   If you're looking for food off the strip, away from the traffic and the tourists, this place is definitely worth checking out. It's not too far from the Strip."}
{"text":"Rice was undercooked. Seriously, they handle rice for a living and yet no one knew?  And the salmon was old. Disappointing. I would've went to 808 Sushi but they don't open for lunch on Sundays......next time I'll stick to 808 Sushi."}
{"text":"We went back! Valentine's dinner at Oyshi sounded so good, so we went. When we got there, we ran into a bunch of people we knew. Lots of our friends are regulars there.  Our server Steven (maybe spelled Stephen) was very nice and paid special attention to us and started up real conversations about UNLV and stuff.  There was only 2 of us and we had to re-order/ask about a couple of things we ordered (same as when we were there with the big group), but it wasn't a big deal because since there was only 2 of us, we got full way faster and were glad to use the digestion breaks between eating.  The creme brulee was divine as always. It's just SO SAD how they only give you 1 dessert when you order AYCE (All You Can Eat) sushi. I want AYCE creme brulee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And still came home smelling like food. LOL.   #foodcrew"}
{"text":"Probably won't be coming here again. Fish and rolls just weren't that fresh or flavorful. And they don't offer 1/2 rolls."}
{"text":"Place was delicious! Definitely recommend it to anyone. There was a variety of selections and the Rib eye steak was amazing."}
{"text":"the hostess is rude and the service over all is extremely poor. It took over 1 1/2 to eat lunch. They did not have the lunch specials available nor did they have mochi ice cream. The customers next to us order gyozas and so did I. They sat down after us but still received their food before us. Also, we order their ice cream parfait and it took at least 15+ minutes to receive it. I would not recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Really cool vibe, our server Golden was amazing brought everything out in a timely manner. I'd definitely recommend this place for group outings!"}
{"text":"Really bad service. We ate AYCE here, had to wait almost 10 min between orders. We had to watch verities of different sushi and rolls going to other tables while we sucked on our chop stick. Even after they apologized same thing happened. We got tired of it and asked for the check, what a surprise they forgot to bring us the check also. We ended going up to them with the money and paid for it at the register. Manager, who was doing absolutely nothing didn't even bothered to offer an apology.  Tip for people that wants to go to this restaurant, make sure you are already full."}
{"text":"The ambiance was very nice, but it was a little pricier than i was looking to pay especially for the all u can eat sushi. Its not a bad place to eat; it lends itself to groups well. But i will say, i've only been once and never needed to go back."}
{"text":"We tried Oyshi on a recommendation from a Renoite transplant that lives in Vegas now, we were expecting decent ayce sushi, much like the ones you can get in Reno....not even close.    Sushi- The sushi is just, ok.  The fish wasn't super fresh, some of the cuts of fish were thin and cut poorly, falling apart.  Most of the rolls had the same notes of lots of imitation crab meat mixture, so they all tasted the same.    Appetizers- I'm a fanatic for raw oysters, they had small Pacific oysters that were a bit on the warm side and very bland tasting, flavorless even with the siracha sauce they dotted on it.  It tasted as though it was about to go bad and they rinsed it with tap water, even the shell the oyster was served in lacked oyster liquor, which isn't a good sign.  Needless to say, I was only able to eat 1 of 4 that I ordered and it was a struggle to keep it down.  I've eaten raw oysters from a jar and the raw oysters here came pretty close to that.  I told the wait staff that the oysters were a bit off and she replied, \"that's odd they're usually not like that\".  The manager was attentive and came to our table to see if we wanted more oysters, stating that there wasn't enough sauce on our previous order as to why they tasted that way. If the oysters are fresh, why would you need to drown it in \"sauce\"?  The sweet shrimp with side of fried heads, amaebi, were not so sweet, which means they weren't so fresh.  The shrimp heads weren't prepared properly, (not fried well) and so it was tough to bite through it.  After having the oyster and amaebi, we passed on the uni, because if you can't get the other 2 right, there's no way we were going to try the uni as it needs to be super fresh.  They were pretty busy for a Tuesday night, so maybe I just have high expectations for sushi, or maybe we just got the Sushi chef in training, but if your like me and your jonesing for some great sushi, this place isn't for you."}
{"text":"Generally speaking, I'm not one that craves sushi. However, I DO find myself craving sushi from Oyshi.  The taste and presentation of everything I've ever ordered here is amazing. You've definitely gotta try the Japanese Lasagna Roll!    Great atmosphere. Great food. Great price."}
{"text":"Yummy! Get the Love Seduction (lobster roll)...wait was really long but food was good however the crunch roll was just alright"}
{"text":"Always great service and great food. There's a wide variety of food to choose from. The love affair is one of my all time favorite rolls. The atmosphere is always friendly and clean. One of my favorite places to have sushi in Vegas! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"LISTEN HERE DAVID!!! I frequently frequent your fine establishment and find it to be fantastic. Among the plethora of nearby sushi restaurants, my friends and I consistently choose yours because you have the best menu, cooked by the best chefs, and served by the best service staff in town. I can't be adamant enough about this. Your restaurant is the closest thing to a perfect sushi restaurant for the price that I have ever been to. If I had one gripe however, it is with the lack of assortment provided for the mochi. Only strawberry?! In 2015? What is this North Korea? Where are the choices?? A meal as good as the ones you provide deserve a happy ending, David. You of all people should know that. Keep up the phenomenal work and PLEASE consider offering more variety in your mochi!!!"}
{"text":"My server for tonight was Odi! She was incredibly attentive & caring with our needs. When we sat down she did an outstanding job at explaining the menu to us and checked on us consistently. If you happen to stop by Oyshi and your expecting quality service I would recommend Odi, plus she has the most contagious smile ever :)  Oyshi truly is the best deal in town for your money with unlimited kitchen/sushi included in the All You Can Eat menu. Definitely a must on my list"}
{"text":"AYCE Sushi! Service was great.  Sushi was good for AYCE standards.  My picks if you're doing AYCE:  Seaweed Salad - pretty standard, kind of small Tempura - SO GOOD!  Agedashi Tofu - good flavor, but wasn't the best that I've had. MOCHI ICE CREAM - you only get to choose one dessert, definitely choose this!! Sunrise Roll - nice spicy flavor  Wait staff was really good at handling our large party of 16.  Kept track of most of the orders and checked on us often."}
{"text":"I dined here for the first time last week.  I was in town visiting some friends and family and went to this place with a large group.  i read the reviews here and thought this would be a great place to try. Especially with the $21 all-you-can-eat sushi for lunch.  The servers were prompt with taking our orders.  Our table was the second to place orders so I thought we would get great service...NOT!  I ordered a cucumber salad for an appetizer and three sushi rolls (rattlesnake roll, crunchy scallop and yellowtail trio).  Well,  it took OVER 30 minutes for my cucumber salad to arrive.  And I had to say something TWICE to the server before it came out.  By the time I got my appetizer just about everyone else in our group had already received and eaten their sushi rolls.  Why did my little cucumber salad take so long to arrive? Did they have to plant the seed and grow the cucumber?  My brother-in-law sitting next to me even got his sushi roll before I got my appetizer.  That was strike one!  Now for strike two - I had to remind the server that I hadn't received my sushi rolls.  This was after everyone else was pretty much finished their rolls.  So even after I reminded him it still took another 25 minutes to get my rolls to me (Yes I was timing everything).  Strike three - I get my sushi rolls. Luckily I wasn't dying of starvation because some others in our group were able to share their rolls so I was able to eat a few pieces while waiting for mine. One thing I noticed was that most of these specialty rolls had this stupid sweet chef's sauce drizzled all over. I don't mind this sauce as its great on dragon rolls.  But this caused everything to taste the EXACT same.  And this sauce was TOO SWEET.  It really killed the individual flavors of the fresh ingredients inside each roll.  My brother couldn't stomach it.  And when I finally got my rolls two of the rolls (crunchy scallop and rattlesnake) were DRENCHED with the sweet sauce.  And the yellowtail trio roll was nasty. It tasted sour like they marinated the fish in vinegar or something!  If you like sweet sushi rolls then this is the place for you.  However I will never set foot in this place again!"}
{"text":"Really good food. AYCE is available. Only thing about this place is it's almost always packed and can get quite loud inside."}
{"text":"How can you beat AYCE sushi for $27?  Had dinner here last night. Sat at the bar and had great service. enjoyed chatting with the chefs and watching the sushi be made.  Service is great, prices are reasonable.  Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"Visited on 12/19/09,  very awesome all you can eat for $26.  We had a great time.  We visited there on the recommendation from others on Yelp.  Oyshi is now on our  \"to do\" list every time we're in Vegas.  Thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality sushi.  I had the garlic yellowtail, tuna and cajun Albacore.  Very very good.  Fast, accurate and attentive staff.  Recommend anyone on this side of town to come and enjoy the atmosphere and top quality sushi.  Will return for sure."}
{"text":"My first sushi experience was at the rainbow location in 2010. Oyshi is my favorite place and we were really excited when we saw that the Sahara location was opening nearby our home. Love your restaurant."}
{"text":"Sucks. Not fresh.!!.not Japanese style at all. super Slow !! Waitress are like sleeping.. chefs are playing...."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a great value. The sushi was fresh tasting and had wonderful flavor. The all you can eat lunch was filling. About 90% of the menu is open for orders on the all you can eat lunch."}
{"text":"Great Sushi SUPER FRESH and excellent service. Stefan really kicked ass. He had great recommendations and it was cool of him asking for feedback of the different rolls and plates that were served.  If we lived here this would be our go to spot."}
{"text":"First time here, and we really enjoyed our experience. The food was delicious, and the service was great. Our server was very helpful, explained the AYCE options, and made several tasty suggestions. We look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"For a sushi restaurant in the middle of the desert, they've got some pretty damn fresh fish and a huge all-you-can-eat (AYCE) menu.  Though there are appetizers and salads, I always go for the nigiri and the rolls to fill that insatiable need for fish and rice. Some of the maki come in hand rolls, while others are baked, deep-fried, full of veggies, spicy, or wrapped in soy paper. You definitely should be able to find at least one item you'll enjoy or you're just flat out doing it wrong.  Once the chopsticks are down and I'm ready to do the Slump of Defeat, the dessert conveniently reminds you that you can get only one of the green tea tiramisu, mochi ice cream, or some of the other selections. Except the ice cream scoops. You can get as many scoops as your dessert stomach can handle!  Service was pretty good, but could be a bit erratic.  They always came to refill our drinks, to check up on us, or to take additional orders.  It saddens me that the journey to Oyshi is so far, but I'm willing to travel the distance for the value and quality that they offer."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about Oyshi, the sushi is excellent and the selection is never ending. I highly recommend that anyone who finds themselves in Las Vegas to make the time and enjoy some of the best sushi around."}
{"text":"Thought we would finally try out Oyshi since we were in the area and had heard such great reviews. Upon entering the place was fairly quiet with the exception of a screaming child, no big deal, and the normal chatter of customers. We came in around 1 on a Saturday and it wasn't very busy and we were seated right away. We put in an order for the AYCE almost immediately and began waiting. It was nearly 25 minutes before we received our first things, we were told the kitchen was backed up, yet when we got our food the calamari was cold, flavorless, and rubbery. My baked roll was cold. When I asked the server if it was supposed to be at least warm, I was given the run around and he finally said it had been sitting while waiting for the other things to finish and that he could get me a new one but it'd be another 20 minutes! I agree and when 20 minutes came it was just as cold as the first time. The manager didn't seem to care and almost everyone else was getting their food in a timely manner except for us. In total we ordered 5 rolls and 1 appetizer (3 of the rolls and the appetizer being ordered in the first 5 minutes of being there) and that was in the span of an hour and a half. even after all that we were given a half ass sorry from the manager and still paid full price. This place is completely over rated and I will stick with a different sushi restaurant that is more reliable and friendly. Too bad because the place was nicely decorated but that's about as far as it went."}
{"text":"Walked in at 10:20 pm since online it says they close at 11 and was turned away saying that they've already done last call. Poor service. Especially since we get off work late and was hoping for some sushi. Smh."}
{"text":"When it comes to \"All You Can Eat Sushi\" you have to be very careful. Low volume restaurants are not able to cycle through the fish making their offerings not so fresh.  The good news is Oyshi is always busy allowing them to offer fresh sushi every night of the week.  There are 2 private rooms, a large dining room and extended sushi bar with a lot of seating.  I highly recommend this sushi bar!"}
{"text":"The food at Oyishi was amazing.  The fish was really fresh and you can tell that the sushi chefs knew what they were doing.   Everything was presented beautifully and also the taste was on point.  The food came out so quickly!   Our server was exceptionally good at her job.  We had a party of 17 and most of us all ordered all you can eat sushi but she never forgot any of our orders.   10/10, I'd go again.    Oh, and the green tea creme brûlée is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"A pretty good AYCE sushi restaurant. Rolls are good and a lot of great options if you have anyone with you that doesn't like sushi. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait to be seated, and some waiting for rolls.  The kids meal is outstanding!!"}
{"text":"I'm really unsure if I should write this review or not but I'm a stickler for customer serivce. We went to have dinner last night 1/9 and the place was packed. The entrance way was so busy we have swim the thru the ppl who refused to make rm, walked up to the hostess counter... a waitress was scrambling around and didn't even acknowledge us! She was walked away and continued on with her shift... next the hostess steps in, grabs menus and walks off to the sea off ppl to seat them... all the while no one has said a word to our party. Then when she finally decides to grace us with her conversation she says it's an hour plus wait... no thanks... so my take on the food is I won't be eating it"}
{"text":"My family and I are big fans of Oyshi. We come here every time we are at Las Vegas. All you can eat offers lots of options for you to enjoy. I highly recommend here for your lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I will never come back to this place again.  It takes 25 minutes to get your first plate of sushi and another 20 for the next plate. They take forever on your orders.  I felt like I had to rush and order quick so they can hurry to make it.  It was horrible and this happen like 4 hours ago and I am still mad.  Plus their sushi is not worth the wait.  The only thing I can say I really like is their egg rolls.  I don't recommend this place ."}
{"text":"Very attentive servers. Cute little sushi spot. Be aware that they do not offer AYCE but the menu is still affordable/diverse. We had a couple of rolls that were fairly average. The spicy salmon roll did not meet our expectations at all. The sashimi, however, was quite good. Considering that there are not many sushi spots in the immediate area it is worth checking out but it's not overly memorable."}
{"text":"I just love it when AYCE sushi places not only serve sushi but all the different tapas style appetizers! Dinner is priced at $26.95.  Service is usually very good. Last time I went, had to wait 20 mins for a table (it was a little busy) and the waiter did not come around as much as I had hoped for. Our water and teas were never refilled without asking. But the other times I have gone prior, service was fine.  When it comes to sushi at Oyshi, ah, I've had better. Their spicy tuna for me was too mushy. I like spicy tuna when the tuna is cut into chucks then mixed with the spicy mayo. So, I was quite disappointed with that. The salmon nigiri was fresh and quite tasty though. I try to stay away from the rolls because they are huge, will become quite full from one roll.   Whenever I find myself at Oyshi, I tend to order a few nigiris then I ransack the appetizer menu! lol. I love the steak. It comes out sizziling on top cabbage and onions. They also have, shrimp/vegetable tempura, bacon wrapped asparagus, scallop poppers, oysters, agedashi tofu, etc.  Oyshi used to be a favorite of mine for AYCE sushi, but after discovering Island Sushi... I don't know if I will be back to Oyshi."}
{"text":"Went during the week for dinner and didn't have to wait long. I really liked the interior and the staff was very nice, we sat at the sushi bar and had great service."}
{"text":"I've been going to this sushi restaurant for a little over 4years. I remember this place because it was where I had my first date on Valentines Day. My opinions on this restaurant has been consistent within these several years. I love this place. I eat here few times a month because I can't get enough of the food! Some reviewers may complain about the service, with a few exceptions, their service to us has been amazing. The thing I admire most about this restaurant is that the service isn't limited to just the servers, but the owner is running around serving people as well. I've been going here for so long, the owner recognizes us each time!   Food: I am obsessed with their Ian's Special Roll. It has multiple layers of flavor goodness!   Things to Try: Snow Mountain roll, Salmon Lover, Tiger Roll, Surf and Turf (appetizer), Ahi poke, Baked Mussels, Grilled Asparagus and Shrimp, and all the sushi fish you desire. Their Vanilla Parfait for dessert is pretty amazing too.   I usually look forward to the Uni and the Oysters, but the reason why it's 4 stars and not 5 is because there have been times where it is not available. And it really puts a damper on my entire meal. Who doesn't want to get their money's worth!   Overall, great experience! When anyone comes into town, this is the first place I take them, and they all love it as much as I do! It's pretty amazing! I've tried so many sushi restaurants here and out of state, and none compares to the sushi place here in Vegas!"}
{"text":"When my friend from Vegas recommended eating at an All-you-can-eat sushi place, first thing I thought of was Todai. NO THANK YOU!  But we went and for $21 (lunch), you can order ANYTHING except drinks. Man, we dined like kings and queens eating everything we could. The only thing was the yellowtail nigiri (usually a favorite of mine) was a pinkish color? huh? Probably wouldn't recommend that.  Rolls are AWESOME! Snow Mountain roll, all the of the baked stuff is good and tuna or salmon nigiri are really good. They don't drench sauce all over it to cover the quality, which I love.  Desserts: creme brulee (pretty good. 4 stars)                    Mochi (exactly like the mochi icecreams you get at the grocery store. 4 stars)                   Green tea icecream (didn't have it but heard it was decent too)  I think I just liked the fact that it was included in the all-u-can-eat package.  Would DEFINITELY recommend!!!!! GO NOW!!!"}
{"text":"Lee, peter, and Daniel were the most amazing sushi chefs! I highly recommend thisnplace. My fav was the labster affair roll. All u can eat is made to order!!!!"}
{"text":"I ate my first sushi meal in Hartsdale NY in 1995.  Since then, I have never left a grain of rice behind on any sushi plate.  I sat at the sushi bar tonight, and the chef just absolutely stuffed me full.  I lost track of how many pieces I had, but I'm sure it was over 31, and the bill was $31.  I tipped the waitress well and threw in an extra $5 to the chef tip jar as an apology for leaving sushi on my plate.  It was all worth every bit of it, including the over-stuffed feeling I'm having now.    There were several pieces where the chef's creativity really came through.  I'd write more, but it hurts to sit down.  I will be back there just as soon as I can.    Thank you, thank you, thank you!    S."}
{"text":"All you can eat menu is awesome! The fish is always fresh, and the environment is relaxing. Usually a wait after 6 pm, but the staff is very friendly. The wait time on fish can be quite a while at times but when it's busy I understand . My favorite is the Japanese lasagna roll! Will be returning!"}
{"text":"At Oyshi right now and been waiting for my miso soup for easily 20 minutes. Terrible service already. Let's wait for the food and see how it taste. First time at Oyshi. Maybe last?"}
{"text":"First time visiting this place. Was craving sushi and this was one of the first recomendations that came up when searching online and thought I should give it a try. Atmosphere is nice, music could be better. Staff are very nice, our server Marcos was very attentive towards our needs. Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"very slow only one sushi guy, i try to go per second time nobody seat me, nobody said hi,nobody ask me,me i help you,wold you like water,very poor service and unprofetional,we left to another sushi place after be seated for 10 minuts,look the sushi bar,dont look to clean,the sushi is ok,but if u like clean good profetional service DONT GO THERE worst service in town"}
{"text":"I love this place! Must do AYCE you won't regret.  Price is good, selection is amazing. Always busy. Call ahead for a table reservation is a plus. Friendly staff all around. Only downfall is it takes a while to get the sushi on the table after you place the order. We like to make a big first order."}
{"text":"Gave this place a shot because my friends are always raving about it. The hostess was friendly. We sat at the only two open seats at the bar. No greeting or anything so we left after about 8 minutes of awkward waiting. To their defense it was extremely busy. Maybe I'll give it another try when it's not so slammed.."}
{"text":"While the place is nice and close to home, I was not a huge fan of the sushi. I always start with spicy tuna before pointing to a handful of other rolls on the menu. While I of course ate the spicy tuna I thought I may have ordered \"sweet tuna\". Because of this I only ordered one more roll (shrimp tempura) and that didn't have a wow factor either. Reasonably priced, nice location in southwest area, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Very nice place good sushi it was teisty and we wiil beck hear!!!! We came to people and it's was wonderful and very good sushi and misses you and other mama thank you very much for a good server"}
{"text":"A friend of mine introduced me to this place last year. His selling point was that \"real Japanese people\" make the food. The funny thing is that the staff and owners are 90% Korean.  Does it matter either way? Masa or Jiro may not care much for it, but by AYCE standards, it's the best sushi in town (best a la carte goes to Naked Fish.) Service is okay but gets a little hectic when the restaurant is at full capacity. No big deal. As an added and bizarre surprise, the pint-sized creme brulee is the greatest I've ever had. If you can resist cramming your stomach with one more roll, be sure to end the meal with it."}
{"text":"This use to be my favorite sushi place and would have earned 5 stars. However, the last two times I've gone with my daughter I've been disappointed.  Not only did it take FOREVER to get our orders but the food was not the quality I've grown accustom to at Oyshi.  Some of the sushi tasted like it had previously been frozen -- not fresh at all.  I'm hoping it's just a blip in time as they opened a second location -- otherwise I'll have to find another place to call my \"favorite sushi place\"."}
{"text":"I came at lunch. There weren't much people-- probably 3 tables besides us. Their food was coming in fast, while my sister and I waited about 30 minutes until our food started coming... Really slowly. I'm guessing it's because we look like college students, and they typically don't tip well. When the orders started to slowly come, they kept mixing our food with the table next to ours and vice versa the entire time. It took us an hour to finally get our 5 orders of salmon, eel, and yellow tail nigiri... Well, never coming back here for the super bad service we received."}
{"text":"I usually come here on Fridays and Saturdays and the service is great, the foods great, and waiting time may be long but hostess is pretty nice & updates when the wait time has gotten shorter. I would recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Ordered the bento combination to try a bit of everything. The sashimi and the tempura were excellent! Chicken teriyaki was only ok, but it's probably a matter of taste.  We were there with two children, and the atmosphere is great for a family."}
{"text":"Love affair baked roll my favorite as well as Asian skirt sizzling plate. All you can eat is $26 and it is all delish. Don't forget you can order appetizers and dessert with all you can eat! Oh and large cold saki is enormous! Good for a few people"}
{"text":"This is one of my husbands favorite spots! We live nearby and go here every time he needs his sushi fix. I don't eat sushi but I absolutely love their house salad OMG the dressing is bomb! It started out Ricky when we first went we always had a waiter that I felt could be a tad rude then we started having Pink whom is real nice but then we met Od!! Od is AMAZING!! Best server we have to ever had--anywhere! She is such a sweet girl and ALWAYS remembers us! She knows us by name and has my difficult order memorized! She even knows the different rolls my husband likes which is crazy bc there are so many! We will be moving to the other side of town soon and the worst part about it is we will be far away from this location. My husband said we will drive way over here just to see Od!!! We love you Od!! Thank you for your awesome service and friendly conversation!! It feels like we are visiting a friend sometimes we want her to pull up a chair and eat with us lol. See you soon!!!"}
{"text":"Had an early Father's Day dinner here tonight! We had Kenny aka Golden as a server and he was excellent!!! Really helped us out with the menu, and was funny too!! The food was great and so was the interior of the restaurant! It's decorated so beautifully!! Also the fact that pretty much the whole menu is AYCE, including appetizers is just incredible! Steak and sushi? Count me in"}
{"text":"I found Oyshi by accident about 3 years ago an it's been my favorite Sushi spot since then. It's definitely the best sushi in Vegas - I always bring my friends so we can try a new roll or just really have a good time.  I would give them 5, 6, 10 stars a couple years ago but the last time I was there I felt the quality of their food went down! The rolls didn't look fresh, the size of the salmon cuts or anything really are half now! I got very disappointed when I left the place, It use to be my favorite must go place in Vegas.  The one good thing about them is I already complained about the service once and they took very good care of me, so I'm assuming if they figure it out the service went down considerably they will definitely take care and made it tool as good as before."}
{"text":"The first time I went here with a couple of friends was on New Year's Eve. The AYCE was WONDERFUL! OOOooo so good! My favorite had to be the Volcano Roll! The fish was super fresh and SO YUMMY! The service was also nice as we got to keep ordering in advance and the waitress was very helpful and courteous. HANDS DOWN A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE FOR ALL!"}
{"text":"Thank you sweet tiny six pound infant baby Jesus! I have been on the hunt for a great sushi spot ever since a horrible experience at my previous spot. Oyshi did not disappoint today. the AYCE menu is extensive. The only bad thing I have to say about Oyshi is the music selection, you will need glow sticks to enjoy it."}
{"text":"A lil bit pricey but it's my favorite sushi place.  I like most of the sushi rolls but my favorites are J&B and Japanese lasagna and dynamite roll. They're like heaven in your mouth.  I also like their appetizers such as baked mussels, ahi poke, agedashi tofu, shrimp yakitori.   Nice EDM music too."}
{"text":"Food good, good price, good portion, good service(our server Kim) man why don't we have a restaurant like this back in the bay."}
{"text":"Very nice sushi place, enjoyed it with my wife very much. A fun atmosphere. Will return soon."}
{"text":"Great menu, and the food is fresh!  We live around the corner from this place so we hit it about once a month.  The prices are reasonable and we always end up eating too much.  HIghly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time visit  Made a reservation  Did not wait at all  Food  Sushi :  3 Star Too much Rice Roll: Ok  Appetiser : 3 Star  ( Surf And Turf, Fresh Oyster ) Table was sticky  Staff : ok  Overrall 3 star"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! The green tea tiramisu is made in house and it is the best way to end a meal!"}
{"text":"I love it when Kenny is our server !! He is honestly the best .. Food is great but he makes the experience way better .. Kevin does the best job managing ... And Chayia does the best rolls"}
{"text":"This was my go to place for AYCE and i dont care for ayce sushi places to be honest, but this one was really good. Ive been here easily over 10x and each time its gotten a little worse i hate to say....the service mainly. There was a few waitresses that were top notch but havent seen them last couple times in, hope they are still there. The food is good place is clean, the management is retarded though. The wait time ironically can be slower when they are not busy than when they are busy (maybe they feel the urgency when they are packed). Either way ill go back until its unbearable that i can no longer stand it there....i mean all you can eat little sliced up rib eye, i usually put down about 3-4lbs of that alone!"}
{"text":"Lets start off that oyshi sushi is one of those places in Vegas that has really good sushi and appetizers. There is alot of things to choose from and all of there sushi taste hella bomb.com lol. Due to the fact it taste pretty fresh and its tasty. And I love the fact this place is All you can eat for the price. The only downside is the deserts isn't all you can eat. But it's all good after eating a gripload of sushi, all you need is a order of one of there deserts, which they are also bomb diggity lol. I also like the fact that this place is very nice and clean  Now here's is why I did not give this place all 5 stars.  The reason is there service. It's a hit or miss with this place. Unfortunately there is like one or two servers who are freaking awesome as hell with there customer service and always brings food out really quick. I can't really say for the other staff members. It seems most of them got a attitude problem or something when you order and are hella slow. It which is kinda sad. Hope they start changing soon cause its kinda hard to go back when you have a couple of bad experiences with a place."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this sushi place, the server was really nice and the sushi was quite delicious."}
{"text":"Came here today and sat at the bar (because you can order half rolls). Exceptional service from the staff behind the bar, funny, quick witted and fun to be around. Food quality was great as usual. Ribeye steak sizzle plate and tiger rolls and you never go wrong."}
{"text":"I've been to Oyshi on several occasions. The restaurant has been really hit or miss. The first time I went with my fiance and we sat near the window, close to the sushi bar. The quality was good and the service was prompt and friendly.  The second time we went we were put in the far corner, probably as far away from the sushi bar as you can get. The quality was still there but the service was terrible. We felt forgotten being so far away and it took a long time to get our first order. When doing AYCE we usually do a first round then inevitably get a second round. With the amount of time it took for the first, we didn't even want to wait for a second round. We left full from the tasty sushi, but disappointed with the service.   This last time we went was for the AYCE lunch. We sat close to the sushi bar, but it didn't matter. We ordered Miso and Edamame to start. The miso was brought very quickly, but we waited easily 30 minutes for our edamame. The waitress came back during our waiting to take our order for sushi. We placed our order and also asked about or edamame. She clearly forgot judging by her reaction.  The sushi came before our edamame and the quality was poor. The albacore was mangled on the rice and didn't taste fresh. Same with the Salmon.   The worst part about the last experience is that during our time waiting for edamame and sushi, we saw our waitress through the curtain in the kitchen eating food. Restaurant no-no 101.   I don't plan on returning. It's disappointing because I like the atmosphere, their selection on their menu (AYCE even includes oysters on the half-shell and Uni!)  On to better places."}
{"text":"CULTURE. FOOD. ATMOSPHERE.   The sushi fad has been rising in Vegas and Oyshi has taken it even further. When I go into a sushi restaurant I look at 3 things:  1. How the restaurant looks. 2. Selection of sushi 3. How the restaurant makes me feel.  Right off the bat, you're welcomed with high end decor that depicts Japanese culture. Oyshi is nothing short of class. I'm a very limited sushi order. Ironically, I'm allergic to fish (I know, right?). However, I am able to eat shell fish, and that is good enough for me to fall in love with this new craze. They have fresh selections and a whole section of shell fish sushi.   And what I love the most about Oyshi sushi, is that it's not some hole in the wall, dirty little restaurant. It's classy, sophisticated, and it's a spot you can bring your valued company. I actually refuse to bring dates here because I don't want them to tarnish this place for me. Highly recommended. They'll remember your name because they remember mine. But it doesn't help that I'm there every week."}
{"text":"Had a mini reunion of friends and chose Oishi Sushi. Gave it 4 stars because of customer service!  Our little waitress was amazing & all the gals & 1 male server there, for that matter!   Food was pretty good...but customer service brought it to 4 stars & I never rate 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I am a Las Vegas native and a big fan of sushi.  I've seen so many sushi places open and close. Oyshi...is one I would never want to see close its doors.  This is, for the affordable price it offers, the best sushi in town. The salmon sushi is just about the closest thing to edible heaven.  The venue is open and airy. The music is upbeat (don't expect some slow, romantic songs). The staff is friendly and everyone pitches in. I've seen managers roll up their sleeves and help out the servers when it gets busy ---very impressed by that."}
{"text":"Love this place, sushi is always so fresh! And very good, if you don't want to wait make a reservation.  The service is excellent!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi we ever had!! We live in Germany and ate here once. We even want to make a reason to go back to Las Vegas just to eat at Oyshi Sushi. The staffs are friendly, sushi was prepared fresh. I envy all of you who live in Las Vegas so you can come and eat here more often."}
{"text":"Love sushi and what a great AYCE.... Best thing on the menu is the green tea tiramisu.... My only complaint is that you can only pick one dessert!!! Please read this and change that policy.... Desert is cheaper to make then sushi..... Great presentation and flavor.... Good service.... Great atmosphere.... I do miss the sushi place that was there before,,, they had a roll I have never seen.... It was on flames literally!!!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. We got pretty terrible service so we will not be back. I refused to let my boyfriend leave her a good tip. She forgot out dessert, then she took forever to bring and pick up our check. Even the chef and other waiter kept apologizing for her. They do not have a good appetizer selection either. Oh and too much rice on the rolls!"}
{"text":"Good food overall. But nothing special. But it is ayce so cant be too picky. Surf & Turf is great."}
{"text":"I love sushi.. and this place is just okay. located very close to me so I end up going here a lot and it's always iffy. Their one manager who has been working the last couple times I've gone is amazing. He's very attentive and talks to the tables and makes sure everyone has what they need. If he is not there.. it's not the same. The service is below average. If they are the slightest bit busy.. you have to wait sometimes 20 minutes before the server will even remember she has you at her table to put another order in. This can sometimes be good because if it's AYCE, you're completely hungry after waiting 20 mins between each roll... we also paid with cash once.. 12 over.. and never got our change. and the service was terrible that time. so really? you're just gonna assume the rest is your tip? mmm no. and then she never returned to the table even though we sat there and waited for quite awhile. oh well.. the food itself though is usually amazing. I've never really ordered anything that I didn't like. Except the mochi for dessert. everywhere else I go they cut it into quarters for you and sometimes even decorate it with chocolate sauce (sushi wa on eastern.. recommend there waaay over this place) .. but not this place.. you just gotta bite right into it and man does that hurt my sensitive teeth. But again, the food is good, and if you go on a less busy night the food comes out somewhat fast.   Also, it can get pretty cramped. Last time I was there they sat a larger table next to us and put a chair on the end. I literally could have rested my head on the guys shoulder who say there. Really? I understand about wanting to accommodate every guest that comes in.. but what about the comfort ability of the other guests already there? mmmm not my favorite place yet I keep returning so it'll get 3 stars."}
{"text":"Everything was great, especially the service.   Our waiter was on top of it!  Will most definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Toronto. Well priced too. It's hard to find because it's tucked under a condo building and it caters mostly to the locals. But well worth it."}
{"text":"Just had a lunch with a friend...terrific sushi, terrific service at a great price. Everything was fresh and served promptly...a real treat to find this quality of sushi in the Southwest Valley...! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite all you can eat sushi restaurant! Sushi is always fresh and we always leave like we've over ate. :) There is however, always a wait and a line but it's because the food is great! Don't mind waiting if the food is worth it! My boyfriend does not  eat sushi but he always has something to order. He orders the mussels, the dynamite, vegas roll, sizzling skirt and asian steak. He also loves the music they play."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi lover and it's hard to find good perfect really sushi but this sushi place is amazing !!!!!!! Everyhting has so much flavor and very inexpensive"}
{"text":"A more classy/upscale sushi restaurant. It is very nice inside and has a great seating arrangement. They have the best appetizer menu out of all of Las Vegas(yakitori, skewers, and rib-eye) and the sushi is very good it is well prepared and presented and the quality of fish is very good and has some of the best specialty rolls too. The servers are very fast and attend to your needs in a orderly manner."}
{"text":"IF I COULD GIVE THEM MINUS STARS, THEN I WOULD GIVE THEM MINUS 5 STARS. I went OYSHI SUSHI tonight. I been here few times before and I enjoyed pretty much. However, today? NOT AT ALL.   It was very normal and nice at the beginning of our dinner.  We stared with miso soup and seaweed salad and some other appetizers. Then we ordered some sushi and the first problem was started with sushi. Their sushi was too many rice with fish. I could not think about taking a picture but it seems like 'Oh you guys will have AYCE? then I will make you not to eat too much.' for me. I wasn't sure whether I order sushi or rice.    Then we ordered 2 kinds of rolls and another seaweed salad during eating it. As you can see in other people's reviews, this place's services sometimes very slow. I expected that seaweed salad can be served right a way because they do not have to cook. We called our server and he just said it will be coming so no rush. Then the seaweed salad came out when we are almost done. You know, seaweed salad is just salad and probably most people eat seaweed salad with other main dishes. That time, we were almost finished so we couldn't finish our seaweed salad.   And finally, we asked for check and told our server that we are all finished. Then he said that he has to charge for leftovers which were 2 peices of roll and seaweed salad. And it will be the normal price, $8, which is regular price for the roll and $5 for seaweed salad. I knew there are leftover charges but I didn't know that they will charge the normal prices. Isn't that means we can take out leftovers when we charge normal prices? But it was also fine. I knew I have to pay for the leftovers because it is AYCE so I said okay we will pay. And he brought check with only extra $5 for seaweed salad. Okay I appreciate with it.  We were disappointed with sushi, slow service, and leftover charge. Then we pay the tip only $1. I know it is kinda rude, but today, I didn't really want to tip them. Then we came out from OYSHI SUSHI.   THE REAL PROBLEM IS THIS. GUESS WHAT.  OUR SERVER FOLLOWED US AND STARTED TO YELL AT US AND SAID F**KING A** HOLE, F**K YOU AND KEEP SWEAR AT US  Before that, we thought today was not really good so we should come again and enjoy our meal but once we hear that the server yelling and swear at us, I thought  tip him $1 was execellent choice.   I know it is not really manner put $1 for tip. But what kind of manner is that? Even though he was upset with us that we put a dollar for tip, that does not mean that he should say FU*K YOU AT CUSTOMERS. MC.DONALD'S WILL HAVE BETTER SERVICE THAN THAT!!!!!!!!! May be he wants too, I WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK THERE WITH PAYING 26-27 DOLLARS TO GET THE WORD FU*K."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here the last time I was in town.  I have to agree that the decor is really savvy and modern.  I was disappointed with the quality of everything else about our dining experience here.  We'll certainly give it another try to see if the food and service are any better."}
{"text":"This place is favorite sushi place in vegas. You need to order the all you can eat option or else you will regret it!!"}
{"text":"Sin City has always been my favorite sushi place and now Jessie is back even better Young, Jimbo, and everyone else ill see you soon:P"}
{"text":"I decided that I wanted AYCE sushi last night (Saturday) so I headed over to Oyshi.  I checked in with the host at about 8:30pm and was informed that it would be about 20 minutes for a table.  It was a nice night, so I just grabbed a chair on the sidewalk in front and waited for the other half of my party to arrive.  There were probably four or five other small groups of people milling about waiting for tables too.  We were seated at the bar just after 9:00pm.  The place seemed pretty busy...  some uncleared tables, a couple large parties (one with kids) occupied the \"VIP\" rooms behind us.  It was on the noisy side, especially with the techno/house/electronica music pumping from the ceiling speakers above the four chef's stations.  After a few minutes we were greeted by a friendly server who confirmed our AYCE preference, took our drinks and asked if we were ready to put in our first round of orders.  We were.  I started with miso soup, an assortment of nigiri style items, an \"ahi poke\" and an order of four oysters (limit 1).  Note:  I thought it was interesting that even though we were seated at the bar, our sushi requests were made with the server.  I guess the server was attempting to queue the orders for the very busy chefs.  The nigiri items on first order arrived quickly and we were told be the chef in front of us that the oysters would be out in a \"little while\".  The nigiri items were nicely presented and of good quality.  The ahi poke was just a small clump of chopped tuna on top of a mix of seaweed salad and sprinkled with sesame seed (not exactly what I think of when I think poke, but I'm not trying to get techincal up in here son).  The oysters came out a few minutes later.  They were covered in green onion, a bit of masago and a squirt of sriracha.  I can only assume that the toppings were meant to cover up the tasteless, been sitting in a fresh-water tank, half-dollar sized oysters.  Engh, I figured I'd keep moving forward, after all this was AYCE...  Round two:  More nigiri (including surf clam, tamago, masago, quail egg, tako, and scallop), something called \"oyshi scallop\", and a spider roll.  We also ordered the chicken, beef and shrimp yakitori, which were all paired with asparagus and came sitting in a sweet teriyaki sauce.  Again the nigiri items were of nice quality.  I'm not sure we ever got the \"oyshi scallop\".  There were two items in the order that looked like a krab salad (the california roll stuff) that I was sure we didn't order.  The spider roll was basically a California roll with one meager soft-shell crab in it, and it had been covered in the same bbq sauce they put on the eel.  Since I was disappointed with the Spider roll and I love soft-shell crab, I put in an order for a Monster roll, which was also supposed to have soft-shell crab in it.  What came out was something similar to the Spider (covered in the same eel sauce) only with the addition of a few slivers of eel and a refrigerator cold tempura shrimp stuffed into it.  Slow down on that eel sauce dawg.  At this point, I was pretty full and done trying...  The sushi chef in front of us was closing down his station, giving it a quick wash down with a wet rag and mumbling something about this night being his \"early out\".  By this time the dining room was starting to clear out too, but the party with the kids were still in our audible vicinity.  I finished up my second pot of hot tea (which was a nice quality loose leaf green) and enjoyed a green tea ice cream mochi ball.  Both of these items were good.  After tipping out the chefs, server and taking care of the bill, I had spent about $75 for the two of us.  I'm not sure I'll be back anytime soon, but I made the best of it while I was there."}
{"text":"I love Oyshi Sushi! It's a fun environment with a great staff and excellent food! Love the half roll option with AYCE at the bar!"}
{"text":"This place is 5 stars all the way. I'm honestly not an owner, a relative of the owner or a friend of the owner. I don't even live in Vegas I am from LA and here on business. But I do get to Vegas quite a bit. And now every time u do get out this way I will be eating here.   I was finishing up a business meeting about 2 miles away and looked on yelp for a sushi place with a good rating. They fit the bill so I drove over there knowing nothing other than they got a great rating on yelp.  When u drove up I was immediately impressed with the outside as it was very attractive and was obviously part of a new shopping center. Then I saw their sign that they had an all you can eat dinner and I got really excited!  Anybody that knows me knows that I can eat. And if your offering me all you can eat im going to be there for a whole. And since I hadn't eaten all day I was ready. I sat at the sushi bar where they told me everything on the menu was available on the all you can eat with the exception of the sashimi.   There were 5 people behind the counter at the sushi bar and they cranked out the food really fast. But it didn't taste rushed and it certainly didn't taste like all you can eat. In fact it might of been true bast sushi I've ever had.   There was one sushi chef that took care of me almost entirely. I'm sorry I didn't get his name because he have me great service as did everyone else I came on contact with.   So to sum it up if you live in Vegas or are visiting (it's only about 10-15 minutes from the strip) you must try it. If you line sushi you will love this place."}
{"text":"Great food, nice people, very busy place, plan to wait to get seated on the weekends."}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying that my hubby and I use to come here often until we moved closer to the other Oyshi location on Sahara (which btw is awesome). I was shocked at how much the service has changed since we last came. The hubby and I came for ayce dinner and were seated right away since we came at a good time. That was about all that was good about our time there. After being seated the waiter took our drink order and brought us our drinks. We then placed our order for 3 sushi rolls. 30 min later we left without getting any of the rolls. This is why. The table across from us who came in about 10 min received a ton of food both sushi and cooked food from the kitchen promptly after ordering while we received nothing. Our waiter kept on telling us our food was coming over and over again but NOTHING EVER CAME!! Sad really! Never coming back to this location again and DO NOT recommend this place at all!! Service is horrible and can not even tell you if the food here is still good. Really wish I could just give this location no stars!"}
{"text":"They served good quality fish, but they used waaaay to much rice.  And the sushi man must have had a bad day because the rice was kind of dry and was hard to swallow.   I asked them to reduce the amount of rice and they said that is standard for all-you-can-eat (hardly, ive been to many and only one other serves that much rice Kobe - right up the block, read my review of that one!)."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were craving AYCE sushi and yelp app led me to Oyshi. $21 for the amount of food we had during lunch is no problemo.   I'm so glad we went. The selection on the AYCE list FAR surpasses any AYCE places I've been to in Cali. Tons of premium rolls, tons and tons of appetizer items (seaweed salad, asparagus tips), you can customize your own sushi, hand roll list is extensive. And the sushi itself is B-O-M-B!   I go to Vegas oftne and I'm so glad my relatives live near this place. I will be going here often. I can see it already. I wanna try the private dining areas for groups one day. Oh and props to the server, Angel. She knows her stuff and was very sweet and attentive!"}
{"text":"I did AYCE here pretty recently. The food is okay, but their selection was smaller than I expected. Also, the service here is definitely lacking. I came here midday on a weekday, and the restaurant wasn't anywhere near busy. They were pretty well staffed, but they still took forever to get anything done. I ordered appetizers and nigiri together when the waiter first came around, but I was left sitting around waiting for my food for ages. The waiter continuously delivered food to my table with no mention of my order for half an hour. I don't know if he forgot to put my order in? Anyways, the staff was far from friendly and attentive. There wasn't anything special about this place that would make me come back. I'd much rather go to Sushi Mon."}
{"text":"Do you want to eat at a place that has cockroaches? Well if that's your type of place come to Oyshi. They linger on the booths hidden between the seats. Beware!  This by far was the worst experience I've had dining at a Japanese restaurant. Yes, this place seems popular but is it clean? Hell to the No!  I can only imagine what they are doing when they are behind the kitchen cooking up a storm.    My fam bam was doing the famous all you can eat. Everything was going smoothly until my cousin noticed this cockroach roaming in the seats. We addressed this to the server who apologized and moved us to a different table. Obviously we lost our appetite. I asked to speak to a manager and as I was looking back the staff was heckling and laughing. They were fully aware of the cockroach issue and perhaps they thought it was funny that we actually saw one. I spoke to the manager and he was not helpful. He was like I'll comp the drinks and the kids meal. Helloooo. There was three all you can eat. He also spoke to me like he also knew about the cockroach problem and explained that summer season that can happen.   As a food venue, that is unacceptable. Do you know what type of diseases or sicknesses that can bring to a human. What if it landed in my soup and I  swallowed a cockroach? Would they blame that on the summer months? As we all know there are tons of food venues around Las Vegas and most are really clean. I would think the health district would not even let a venue like that pass with an A rating if it was infested with cockroaches. For all those who want to experience the future Oyshi dining.. make sure you bring an insect repellant spray so that way you are sure not to get that on your food. Beware of cockroaches!  They can creep up on your soup or maybe even become an appetizer if you aren't paying attention. Cockroach roll with the eel sauce, anyone?   Just to let everyone know. I paid for my meal. I am not the type to look for comps. I am the type that enjoys a clean place to eat."}
{"text":"This place is the tits . Absolutely 5 star mo fucking delightfulness. The server was absolutely stellar. A trip down the the peculiar into a word of gallant memories. A meal inside a giants eyeball !"}
{"text":"I ask for all you can eat menu they took forever to bring food I got only two orders of sushi not that great. And ask for third plate they never bring it instead they bring me the check. The white boy MIRO. His name waitress. Was rude Never comeback. Here"}
{"text":"Our go-to sushi place!! I never leave disappointed. All you can eat is the way to go. Good music, too :)"}
{"text":"Just as I remembered it minus the suuuuper sloooow/bad service. Maybe we just had the worst server ever (Sang). Yes, I'm putting you on blast! He got flustered after taking orders from a third of our party and couldn't even get that right. Other servers had to help him as he was so overwhelmed. Our check was wrong. Luckily for Mr. Sang we were automatically charged 18% for having a large party. He wouldn't have gotten much otherwise.  The food was good when it finally arrived. Much better than most ayce places in Vegas. You really can't beat it for the price."}
{"text":"My family four members enjoyed All U can eat. It is fresh and good taste. However the waitress who is japanese(?) is not kind I think. Also I wish the price should be down. It's little bit expensive though It was over 140dollars"}
{"text":"I use to love coming to this sushi restaurant, but it seems to be slowly declining. I was just there a week ago and flys surrounded our food.  The restroom was dirty with the rolls of toilet paper just sitting on the floor and this was at opening. Also I was served a glass of water with lipstick on the glass. It's too bad because I loved this restaurant but won't be back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"All-You-Can-Eat sushi places are very hit, or miss here in Las Vegas. Most of the time the fish is dry and not very flavorful. Oyshi breaks this trend. Their rolls are delicious. The Red Rock, Lobster Fair and Yellowtail Trio are must tries. Their fish is very fresh, moist and flavorful. For an All-You-Can-Eat sushi place, Oyshi is a cut above the rest.  Service at Oyshi is very friendly. The staff are knowledgeable about the menu and the art of sushi. They are always willing to suggest and prepare something new for you to try. I go here often and sit at the sushi bar. Both the servers and the sushi chefs know exactly what I like and how I like it prepared."}
{"text":"Chef Pedro always makes me feel welcome and in my belief the best sushi chef in town. The fish is always fresh and at the right temperature. AYCE is the best option."}
{"text":"Fabulous fresh sushi, polite and efficient staff and a great menu with lots of variety. The best deal however is the AYCE (All You Can Eat) menu! $27/pp and you can get everything from appetizers to rolls and other dishes, even dessert! We polished everything off! Delicious all around and we will now be regulars!!!!"}
{"text":"I go to Oyshi on a consistent basis, as I live just down the street. The food is always delicious and fresh, although I feel the AYCE is a tad overpriced for dinner as there are some odd restrictions (only one dessert per customer except for ice cream, etc.). The service is hit or miss; it's either excellent and quick, or exhaustingly slow.   I usually do AYCE, but order mostly appetizers. The gyoza are fresh, crispy and delicious. The Asian Skirt Steak is wonderful. The Chicken Yakitori is also on my favorites list. As far as sushi rolls are concerned, I've always ordered the Crunch Shrimp Tempura roll. No complaints about the food, except for the cut pieces are sometimes too big to eat one piece at once."}
{"text":"Service was good but the food is sub par at best..food prep and presentation was horrible but the real surprise was the worst shimp tempura i have ever had..this place is what happens when management chooses to not use properly trained staff to save a buck..will not be back"}
{"text":"By far our best AYCE Sushi spot I've had. Service and atmosphere is on point!! Huge menu and the food is delicious. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Wow!! I love Oyshi! I'm definitely coming back and recommending it to everyone I know! I have been to a lot of AYCE sushi places in Vegas and there hasn't been a place that I really loved more than this one.  My absolute favorite was the Dragon roll, it is ell with avocado. mmm! The Nigiri is super fresh and delicious. It was great all around. TY"}
{"text":"This place has now become my favorite! I love their all you can eat!! Unlike other places they serve u half rolls upon request & u can order as many rolls at a time that you want. Appetizers & dessert also included in the happy hour! My favorite dish was the surf & turf! Chef Ivan is pretty helpful when it comes to recommendations & his convo made the meal even more enjoyable! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"I've been giving this place many, many, many chances hoping their food would be fresher/better but after being disappointed time and time again, I've decided to finally rate this place. I live off nigiri and their fish here is rancid, including their version of toro. Cut of the fish is also thinner than usual. The rolls are decent; the best thing on their menu is the poke bowl and sizzling platters, but both not worth the AYCE price. Better bet is to just make the drive to goyemon or sushimon. Service is ok, a hit or miss. All in all, Nothing worth warranting another visit."}
{"text":"Food is very good and fresh, the restaurant is very clean and open spaced. Only issue is service. Wait staff is polite and attentive only problem is the venue is under staffed. 3 servers for an entire restaurant will cause problems."}
{"text":"Horrible service and charged us extra on all you can eat sushi cause we didn't eat two of the rolls that we thought was just awful. Highly don't recommend"}
{"text":"I'm a BIG fan of \"All you can eat(AYCE),\" when i'm extremely hungry. i've been to hikari and i've always had a BAD tummy ache when i leave that place.  i live on the SW of vegas and always driven past oyshi. \"AYCE\" sold me. i went online to check the reviews on yelp. i was excited and drove down to the restaurant.   the ambiance was hip and played house music. i sat at the sushi bar and it was a huge table. everyone was 'nice' when i got there.  i am a petite girl.. 105lbs less.. and i love to eat! i had a minimum of 2hrs to eat. they warned me that if i had leftover rice or sushi, i will be charged.  i was game.  i got there at 8:30pm. ordered my miso soup that they had forgotten 20mintues later.  i must admit the sushi and rolls were delicious. i think once they got the hint that i kept ordering and ordering.. no sushi chefs didn't want to serve me and it was only 1/2 hr into dinner. everytime i wanted to order something, they walked away and pretended not to hear me. i assume they want to stretch the 2hr minimum by not serving me. then i felt like i was begging for food. at this moment, i remain a big smile on face and it turned into a nightmare. everyone was sooooo mean!  they wanted me to leave! whatever i ordered in the kitchen.. the items were for smurfs! asparagus wrapped with beef were the size of chopsticks!  it was 9:30 and the 10th server gave me the check! i was not done eating and haven't gotten to my dessert. i am a polite customer, fun, and spoke to the chefs the entire time. i ask the server if my 2hrs were up and he said the manager gave him the check! WTF??? i ordered my dessert paid my check, gave them a 20% tip for the food and promise i will never come back even if it was for free.   i was hoping this was going to be a great experience because once i tasted the food, i fell in love with the freshness. nonetheless, i am loyal customer anywhere i step foot in and it would have been sooo convenient. no matter how great the food, if you don't have customer satisfaction, you will never have them coming back!"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi we have ever had! Everything was fresh from the sea urchin, salmon belly, to tuna. The service was great to. The waiter (i wish i cpuld remember his name) was very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. We will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I would like to say that being turned down at 1150pm on a Saturday when they close at 1am is bs!!! I will recommend to all of my industry friends that would think about rushing to eat sushi at this place to go elsewhere. I understand it is ayce but all I wanted was a couple rolls and it was 1150!!! Completely unacceptable in my opinion."}
{"text":"First time I came here was last year Thanksgiving, I was like wow.. this place is a gem...Second time I came here was July 4th weekend.. I was like.... nah.......won't come here again. We came here for lunch. There were like only 7 tables and there were 3 sushi chefs but the service was extremely slow. Guess what? We only had 2 rounds of sushi in 11/2 hours! You're prolly wondering if we ordered like tons of sushi...nope not even close to  20 pcs each round. Not to mentioned that the quality went straight down.... we didn't even bother to get the third round... The bill came and guess what? They charged us 18% tips for 2 people!!  No apology and what so ever... The server said they got the wrong check for the wrong table... so does that mean that they were charging other tables 18% tip? Whatever reason it is, guys pay attention to the bill.. it's no joke! (c the photo)"}
{"text":"Came here for bday dinner service sucked ass couldn't be bothered to even ask to refill our drinks waited forever to get our rolls when we went to order again we waited literally for 20 minutes to get our food or even see a waitress will not be back  Very disappointed. Also watch your check they like adding on items and have an 18% mandatory tip that was not deserved."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service.  Ask for Thomas to be your server.  My favorite roll is the Hawaiian."}
{"text":"I have eaten here quite a bit and over the last 2 year the customer service and quality have gone WAAAAY down.  They need to hire more staff and get better fish suppliers.   I had to flag down a server 3 times to place an order.  Two orders were completely wrong.  My Tiger roll fell apart while trying to pick it up.  I waited 30 MINUTES for a Dynamite roll.  This was at 1:30 when I was 1 of 8 people in the place.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service for an all you can eat joint. It's very clean and nicely decorated inside and the sushi is always on point! This is one of the few places I have found where the service and quality of food isn't lowered because it is AYCE. There are tons of options for sushi and non sushi lovers. Oyshi is great for both small and large parties."}
{"text":"Had a great experience with All You Can Eat at the Sahara location!! As always oyshi pushed the limits and delivered outstanding customer service!!  The waiter was slammed and kept getting table after table and just kept the food coming!!!  Great experience!! Will be back again, just learned about their AYCE happy hour."}
{"text":"Its good. Not great, but good. You will find all the standard sushi stuff on the menu. Nothing too creative.  But still enjoyable. Its 3.5/5, but im rounding down. Ive had better in the gta."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the Wife and Daughter today for one the trully best bites in Vegas in my opinion, My Man Kenny killed it as usual with his on point service and attention to detail!!!!  Much thanks to all the skillful hands behind the line.  If you don't know ....now you know! ------oyshi-----"}
{"text":"I walked in like a boss with my sister was immediately seated by a young waiter by the name of Kenny who was very kind and cracked jokes made us feel welcomed. We sat at the sushi bar and our Chef was Nacho and let me just say he makes some really foodgasmic rolls some are his creations others on the menu he listened intensively and made rolls to our liking which made it all the better thank you Oyshi Sushi staff! Also the music  chill."}
{"text":"I ate here once...FANTASTIC!!  The sushi was fresh, Uni, sweet shrimp, and all the basics were as well.  They also have a great selection of cooked foods for my non sashimi eating friends that came with me. AYCE on top of that? Yeah this place is great when you just want to eat and want to get away from the bustle of the strip!  The staff was very attentive too.  I was very impressed!!"}
{"text":"The fish is unbelievably fresh for the desert.  The all you could eat menu is not limited to the sushi but practically every thing on their regular menu from steak appetizer to shrimp tempura and even includes dessert.  I would have given them a 5 star, but their wait staff seems to be inconsistent.    We have been away from Las Vegas for over 2 years now and we haven't found a replacement in L.A. or the Bay Area and plan to go back every time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had lunch yesterday at Oyshi, it was the first time I'd ever been there.  I'd read some of the earlier reviews about poor service, but I have to say there was no trouble at all when I was there. The waiter (Vincent) was very attentive and friendly. He answered questions about menu items that we asked about and commented on his favorites. There were two other people that kept coming around and filling our water glasses whenever they got low. Food came out fast and was delicious!!!  I had the \"Oh My Heart\", the \"Hawaiian\" and the \"Lobster Fair\". All were exceptional!! I could have ordered 3 of the Oh My Hearts and been perfectly happy - it was awesome!! The last one I ate (Lobster Fair) was almost too big but very tasty!  Oh My Heart - Spicy Tuna, Crab Mix, Avocado and Shrimp Tempura rolled in Soy Paper. Eat this!!"}
{"text":"We have just moved from California. Happened to run into the place and ordered to go the first time. Enjoyed the food and the price. Went there during dinner the second time and was disappointed at the front desk hostess. We waited for about 10 or so minutes (she was on the phone the whole time ignoring other customers) until they cleared a table for our party of five in the main dining area, BUT she immediately sat a party of 2 and another party of 5 who came in after us at the other area behind the front desk...so how come we were not seated there when we came in??? There was an empty table that we can see while waiting...When the hostess sat us, neither a smile nor a word...when she brought our bill, i had my hand up to reach for the tab and she flopped it down the table ignoring my hand out...when we left no thank yous, nothing...talk about customer service...this is the kind of attitude that makes you hate the place...people not the food.....I will go back but if i see her behind that desk i will look for another place...."}
{"text":"Good food. Service absolutely horrible. Didn't bring refills when asked repeatedly. Forgot food.  I will no longer come to this location EVER again. The one on rainbow is amazing."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we've come early enough but the hostess didn't want to seat us so we are going elsewhere ... $300 tab .... Your loads mutha fuckas !!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here.  We ordered the crazy cali roll and the volcano roll.  Excellent service,  friendly staff and good food!  We will back."}
{"text":"Cajun albacore was delicious! Service a little slow today but friendly staff and good apps, sushi and rolls!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. The food is the best AYCE sushi in town, in my opinion.  But as for the service... VERY SLLLLOWWWWW. Waitresses don't come around to check up on you as often as they should, and the orders take a long time to get.  I waited 30 min for the waitress to return and another 20 min to get my order of rolls.  That would be my only complaint, which is sorta a big deal!"}
{"text":"The worst ever. Don't recommend anyone to come here. Waiting almost 2 hours waiting for a simple table of 4. After constantly checking wait time w host they somehow forgot about us and sat others right as they walked in after having is wait for 2 hours now. Then after complaining they said they had forgotten about us, and now they will sit us so walking towards the host booth once again ... I can see about 6 open tables and they still had the nerve to say wait 10 more minutes, ofcourse we just walked out. Even bartender felt bad for us. He was the only nice one there. Horrible host service."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and sat at the bar. The sushi chef ( heavier set Latino man) was very disinterested and continued that way the entire time. Never did he ask what I wanted or like. It seemed as if I was inconveniencing him with my orders. As I began to eat I started noticing flies buzzing around the bar then my food. So I was constantly swatting them away.  Then Chef Ed came out and began to prep food with the other sushi chef. While prepping he started profusely rubbing his nose then wiped it onto his chef jacket without ever washing his hands. He did this 3-4 times before I finally lost my appetite and asked for my check."}
{"text":"If you don't like Oyshi sushi, then you're probably a Communist who hates freedom and puppies. It's just that simple.  There aren't many good ayce establishments in Las Vegas,  however Oyshi on Sahara stands out as a rarity. The fish is unusually fresh for ayce, the fusion rolls extremely creative, and the sushi chefs - starring Chefs Daniel, Pedro, and Curtis - are awesome guys that know what they're doing (they also have a sense of humor). Additonally, the servers have all been very friendly and everyone makes you feel really welcome.  This is the only ayce sushi restaurant I go to in Las Vegas. Give 'em a try. If you don't - or if you don't like it - then I hope you can rest at night, comfortable in the knowledge that you are everything that is wrong with America."}
{"text":"Great food and good prices. lve never had bad service even when they're jam packed, servers are attentive and prompt. Sashimi platter and Poke are my faves from here"}
{"text":"So the beautiful girl I've been dating told me about this place being one of her favorites so of course I had to take her there.  We made sure to sit at the bar because you get excellent service when you do.  The food was amazing and the staff was super friendly and upbeat.    Tun was the chef making most of our rolls and he even introduced us to the supervisor Nye who offered us some complimentary Sake which we turned down because we were already on our second bottle.  They have a happy hour from 11pm-2am with buy one get one Sake or Beer.  They also had just launched ladies night which knocked down the price for the lovely lady on the All-You-Can-Eat to $21.  We started with the Seaweed Salad before we moved on to the fabulous rolls.  We had the Monster, Japanese Garlic Lasagna, Dragon, Vegas, and Oyshi rolls.  We wish we could have tried more but we were stuffed.  We sat around chatting with the friendly staff and drinking Sake until we had a little more room in our tummies for dessert.  I highly recommend this place for the great food, fun atmosphere, and they play House music."}
{"text":"I hope it is just growing pains. Only one server. Waited on refills for quite a long time. Sushi was good. BF ordered surf n turf... It was bland and not worth the money. I know it a sushi place but they should make the quality of food great throughout. We will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant, usually always poppin' so you just have to be patient with their staff. I would recommend going late night if possible.   Not only does all you can eat apply to just sushi, you can basically order anything on the menu (as many times as you want).  Recommendations: Salmon Nigiri, Sweet n Spicy Pork"}
{"text":"We went to Oyshi tonight and had the all you can eat Sushi.  If it wasn't for the Server I would give it no Stars. The food was terrible and when you ordered a roll the inside was the size of a Nickel and the roll because of all the rice was the size of a Silver dollar.  The meat had no taste on a meat dish and the and the egg roll was overcooked and tasted terrible. My wife almost got sick on the Mackerel sushi. I couldn't honestly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Saw this Sushi place and something about it caught my attention, so I decided to check it out. My boyfriend and I went there on a Friday date night. The place wasn't busy at all, but there was a larger party in the back. The sushi was amazing!! I already want to go back. I can't even recommend one dish. They were all so so good."}
{"text":"Love the quality, so many different flavors to chose from and their green tea ice cream it's just amazing!. The place it's always nice and clean and fancy by the way!"}
{"text":"You guys can mark it this is my place to eat sushi it's really really tasty very good service it's very clean and very good environment go ahead and take your wife your boyfriend your girlfriend your husband and try it"}
{"text":"Food quality is not bad but they got the worst customer service. The server i had was so rude and doesn't even know how to make recommendation. I usually give 20% tip for server but this time i only gave tips to sushi chef because the server i had doesn't deserve to get ANY tips. I am not coming back"}
{"text":"My go to spot for weeknight sushi. The service is great if you eat in, and take out is great too (we usually go for take out). Sushi is fresh.  We usually get a large platter, and the selection and variety of fish is great."}
{"text":"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice? Shame on me.  I won't be back.  Love the atmosphere of this place. Has a good bar, neat little lounge area,and the sushi is decent for the price.  But I don't know if the service can be any slower. First time,restaurant half empty, took us (4 people) 30 minutes to get our first round of sushi.  After that the waitress disappeared and we didn't order the second round for another 20.  Last night there were two of us at the bar, again, the restaurant was 3/4th full.  First round of sushi came out fairly quickly, however our server Mono disappeared time after time as we sat there with no food, or empty glasses.  Lousy.  I guess it's my fault for thinking a second chance was needed.  Taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Always one of my favorite places to eat.  Service is great, food is awesome, and after going there for the past year the chefs know already what I want.  Always recommend this place to family and friends."}
{"text":"I've the all you can eat sushi at oyshi.  This location is just as yummy as the location on Rainbow.  I recommend that you sit at the sushi bar for the best experience.  This is a great way to get good recommendations from the sushi chefs."}
{"text":"I guess yelp deleted my review.  Too bad im writing another one.  Came here with my niece.  Stood in line waiting to be seated.  Ignored.... then a party of 4 behind us got greeted instantly and then sat. Right away.  This was before i found out about goyemon.  Crap service.  Btw hamachi here smells like old fish.  Fresh hamachi doesnt smell.    Also ordered fresh wasabi here once.  Bought me the regular wasabi then charged me for fresh wasabi..."}
{"text":"I love this place. First time here and it's now my \"go-to\" sushi spot. Our chefs were John and Curtis. We had all you can eat at the sushi bar and we had great conversations. Every Tuesday, is sushi day. Along with our favorite chefs.  Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"Don't go this restraunt.They served rotten urchin. I Instantly ran to the restroom, then vomitted. No apology, no polite attitude."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in Vegas. The rolls are always on point and the staff is super helpful. Go with all you can eat and enjoy yourself, might I suggest the Japanese lasagna and the surf and turf they are the bomb diggity and also the green tea creme brulee. Heck yeah!"}
{"text":"We just visit today 09/04/15 at lunch time  We eat AYCE Me and my husband not Gonna coming back NEVER!!! HORRIBLE SERVICE !!!! Our server is Kevin  He never check back our table for another order with all you can eat??!! All the time we have to say something the other person  So we feel so bad i dont know thats why Food also bad ,not OYSHI !!!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhh, Oyshi, my favorite sushi place. I don't really like raw fish and I looooveee Oyshi's large selection of baked. Not too expensive so far as sushi goes, and it is very good quality. I've been coming here for years and love it!"}
{"text":"I have been to the old Oyshi a billion times, and have been going for years, so I am definitely a loyal and loving customer. Oyshi at Rainbow gets crazy packed busy, and for good reason.  I am not a raw fish fan and like someone else said they have an excellent menu especially for those of us who like cooked fish.  I came to this location for the first time on a Monday at dinner time. There was only a few people here, but for some reason they sat us right next to everyone else?  Our waitress was very sweet and nice. Our food came out very slowly and took a very long time in between even though there was two cooks and not too many people. I saw a shrimp tempura lying on the floor, who knows how long, kinda gross.  It's pretty and new, but I'm not sure"}
{"text":"A local recommended Oyshi and I can see why.  Place was packed when we got here.  It's off the strip in a strip mall no doubt and people were waiting to be seated.  We ordered off the all-you-can-eat menu and believe me, it was a huge menu.  Will all restuarants like this, if you leave any leftovers, they will charge you, but I have a feeling they dont follow through w that.  The price was around $25, but hello, we ordered tons of shashimi and rolls worth way more than that.  You also get dessert with your meal and alcohol is extra (of course).  You won't find tourists here, just locals and regulars who knows you don't have to be at some fancy shmancy restuarant to eat good sushi."}
{"text":"Doing some free lance work in this part of town and the very helpful office staff recommended lots of places for lunch. This was not one of them. Lol. To quote one assistant, \"I've had better. Their fish is not fresh.\"   But I'm not one to be influenced by others - except you Yelpers!   Why 3 stars? Food is just okay. I'm not sure if the fish isn't fresh but the rolls and sashimi were just okay. Nothing special and the spicy tuna looked weird. Like really red. And yes, I've had better.    The music was intrusively loud. I know I sound old here, but when the music distracts from the food, there is a problem.   The service was excellent - that's what's expected and deserved in Las Vegas. Seriously. This town has the best customer service!    I don't think I'll return - too many better sushi places in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch today!  Kenny was hands down the best server we have had here!  Very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu.  We loved the Nuclear Bomb roll and shashimi salad!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed ! We came here with family since my brother highly recommend this place. We were a group of 12 and had to wait because the place is packed on a Saturday night. Almost an hour had passed and they said it will be ready in 10-15 mins. Then came a group of 11 who came and were seated right away. I don't know if they had reservation but we just felt ignored the whole time. So I asked the receptionist that why is it taking too long? And she said that we are a big group blah blah blah. My dad was really upset and confronted the manager and the manager \"Kevin\" said if you continue to complain then the more you are going to wait. That made me really furious because nobody should disrespect anyone no matter what. So I told him to cancel it and the manager said \"Good!\"   I don't know if this manager had restaurant etiquette but even if people had high praise about your food but the service sucks it doesn't make you of a good place! I'm not sure if he owns the place but if there is a bigger boss he should not be working in a restaurant since he doesn't respect the customers and honestly we felt discriminated.   I've never felt so bad like this because it involved my family and it was suppose to be a nice dinner to wrap up our vacation in Vegas. I just hope this would be the last time they are doing this to anyone because it's a waste since my brother said its one of the best in Vegas. And to Kevin the Manager, one of your job Is to respect your customers the food just comes second your service is more important just in case you never knew that !"}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant is awesome ! Our server Lolli was great ! Very attentive & would always check up on us to make sure our food was right & we were satisfied. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Had sushi at Oyshi on Christmas Day! This place was very busy. Food took some time to be served, but, service and Sushi were great!"}
{"text":"We came in an hour before you close and your host denied us seating . How does that make sense? That really made us upset. Ruined our night."}
{"text":"If this video is any evidence, we thoroughly enjoyed the meal and more. The all you can eat is a fantastic deal and I didn't have a single roll I didn't enjoy. Sexy Roll and the Nagiri were highlights. Great find for our trip!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi in town and the staff are super nice! Service is always on point and the food is delicious! Can't wait to go back again for all you can eat next cheat meal!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place to go to in Vegas. The sushi is always fresh and the Asian skirt steak is to die for! The service is usually pretty quick and very efficient. I eat here like once or twice a week."}
{"text":"I went here the other night because I wanted to try their dessert. It looked delicious! I spent hours looking at the menu items at their other location. It appears the Sahara location will have other menu options which is odd since they are owned by the same owner, but it may that they have different nightly specials.   I really liked the quail egg sushi. It is a raw egg, but it tastes sunny side up egg which is perfect since I love egg yolk! I have heard that this place has horrible sushi, but it wasn't bad at all. I did not like their special of the day which was negotori (I'm not sure if that's correctly). When we looked it up, it said it was fatty tuna. When it did arrive, it was not solid and the rice tasted heavily of sesame oil. They did have white tuna,   I do love that they also have a other options like their steak, surf and turf, spicy pork. I usually like to order a ton of appetizers and non sushi. Their tempera batter was okay. It wasn't as crispy and crunchy as I would have liked. It was the same thing with the calamari.    I did not like the green tea tiramisu. It was very very wet. I do not like that you are only allowed to order one dessert per person."}
{"text":"The name Oyshi doesn't stand to the expectations of the restaurant. The food quality is poor and tasteless and the staff members don't seem to care about customer service. An order to make it unique and enjoyable is by starting with the staff members on how to provide good customer service and take pride of what they representing. I am pretty sure the owner doesn't care as well because if he does he would take ownership and control of his restaurant sence this issue is been the same for majority the time this restaurant is been opened. Very disappointed long time waiting for appetizers and extremely slow service and lack of knowledge and skills from staff members as a whole restaurant aspect."}
{"text":"First time @ Oyshi on Valentines day  Food was ok and Service was great Thank you Tiffany for your recommendations and helping us~ We enjoyed our dinner :)  I will be back!!~   Rolls that you must try. Rattle Snake, Love affair, Double Salmon, Nyi roll"}
{"text":"Favorite AYCE sushi place in Vegas.  It's a 30 min drive one way and still we go.  Quality and selection is excellent.  Many AYCE places will not customize orders... these guys do.  The staff is great... food is awesome... atmosphere clean and club/trendy.....but everyone knows this...  so I recommending calling ahead... don't be suprised to wait a while for a table during peak hours."}
{"text":"Ok so most All You Can Eat sushi restaurants have basically the same menu but this place has a few extras that make it beat Sushi Mon and all the other places alike. The uni was fresh and buttery and I liked the fried head of the sweet shrimp with ponzu. The tuna poke app was delicious and refreshing. Dinner was $26/person and we were lucky to get put in one of the private rooms. Also, the service was EXCELLENT! They were fast and kept our table clean and well maintained.  But the thing that made this place stand out in my opinion was.....their Green Tea Tiramisu. It was HANDS DOWN the best dessert that I have ever had in my life. I will drive 4 hours from LA to Las Vegas just for that!"}
{"text":"I went there with my wife and my daughter Friday night, we set down by the bar area and Curtis was our sushi specialist, let me tell you something all I did was, I told Curtis, I like tuna, salmon and eel and he made me the best sushi I've ever had, very professional and friendly. A1 quality, go and ask Curtis for some custom made sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi is great but service is bad never asked to refill my water. 30min just to find my waiter to order and another 30min to get my sushi."}
{"text":"I arrived at the restaurant with my party of 4 was told it would be a 15 min wait, even though 70% of the tables were empty. At this point we offered to sit at the bar  which only had more than 10 avail seats, and we were told the issue was the staff was backed up and we could not be seated there either. We waited approx 20 min before we were sat at a table that had more soy sauce on the menus than were in the soy sauce pots. We placed our order, half our party received their rolls within an acceptable 15 min (We took a soy sauce pot from another table that had been empty the entire time and that one was also empty) while the other half did not receive anything until 45 min had gone by and the other half of the table had eaten their entire order. After 1 hour the person next me and I had received 2 of the 3 rolls we initially ordered and we canceled the remaining order. The server took off our drinks and did not charge us the remaining rolls even though one of the elusive rolls showed up the min we tried to leave. Food was good/average for a sushi place in this price bracket waiter was prompt and courteous. The one star is for the food and the waiter otherwise I would select none.  Restaurant was just poorly staffed/operated. One last thing the was the restroom looked like it was hit by hurricane Sandy and the host really did not seem to care about anything. Who understaffs a restaurant on a Saturday night?"}
{"text":"Place was kind of small but the staffs personalities and great energy made up for the lack of space. It's always refreshing to find restaurants with an enthusiastic staff! The sushi was delicious, I highly recommend the Japanese lasagna and tako salad."}
{"text":"great food! very fresh. Great service and very polite. Very welcoming crew. The decor is very nice and fresh. You will Love this place."}
{"text":"I reserved a table here for my brother's birthday and actually had to make a few last minute changes to the reservations and they didn't make a big deal out of it.   We were seated in the private room that has a big flat screen tv with sofa seating. I suggest reserving this room for a special occasion or if you have a large party.   We all had the all-you-can-eat sushi and for $26 it's a steal! There are a few catches though..only a 4 oyster limit per person and you have to eat the rice that comes with your sushi or they threaten to charge you for it .   I think we ordered everything on the menu but a few dishes that stood out were: rib eye steak teriyaki (not over cooked at all), calamari (I didn't get a chance to try this but other people at our table kept ordering more of this) J&B roll (soooo good with the baked scallops on top). I thought the baked rolls were a lot larger than the other sushi rolls so be careful not to order too much (like we did).   Our waiter was pretty attentive and even offered to take our picture for us. The owner was really nice. I think I talked to him about making the reservations and when he heard it was for a b-day he gave us the private room even though our party wasn't that big.  I'll definitely be coming back here the next time I'm Vegas."}
{"text":"I signed up for Yelp just to write this review and warn everyone that they have HORRIBLE service. their food is not any different from any other sushi restaurants. Trust me, Goymon or I love sushi has WAY BETTER SUSHI. so the night went like this...... I had guests all the way from KOREA. they are the ones who saw the review of this place and told me they want to go. I told them they are not that great (since I have been here several times) but regardless to my opinion, we went. We waited for 30 mins to be seated which is not a big deal. I understand sushi restaurants get busy for dinners.... We sat down and ordered a few nigiris.... THEY brounght 4 pcs every 20 minutes. Once again, I have been to other sushi restaurants and I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT NO MATTER HOW BUSY THE RESTURANT IS, nigiri never takes that long.. so as a result, within an hour... we ate 6 pcs between 3 people. I asked for a manager and told them the situation, and he said THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO. (NOT EVEN SORRY) so we said we want to leave and THEY CHARGED US FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF 3ppl's ALL YOU CAN EAT. I am telling you right now, if you want to ruin our dinner with AWFUL FOOD and IRRESPONSIBLE and RUDE staffs, this is the place to be. NEVER EVER AGAIN. THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER."}
{"text":"I was there 2 days ago and waited 20 min. To get served with only 5 customers there. 20 min rolled by and took our order. The server never showed up since, and wait 45 mins until I asked what is the update with our order. The manger blew me off and was rude. I then told him to cancel our order and then went to Kobe Sushi down the street with better service and great food. Oyshi- you better step up your game with customer service before you guys lose business. Would not recommend this place. Go to Kobe!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi at a fair price.  We did not do the AYCE option, but ordered 4 different rolls, a (huge) house salad, and a soft drink for around $30.  Service was slow but the food was good and it was a nice meal out."}
{"text":"Sushi and udon soup were awesome but there us not more than this soup and two maki rolls for vegetarians! I hope they  will put more vegetarian stuff in the menu..."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Used to go to Kobe Sushi for all you can eat as well but they closed. Didn't think I'd find a replacement and it's even better.  It's not a buffet... simply order from alloys of options and enjoy."}
{"text":"We didn't know what to order, so the waitress recommended some and the food was outstanding. The tea was just different, I guess I'm used to American tea."}
{"text":"- VERY mediocre food quality for the price - the $10 pitiful dragon roll brought the food grade down to 4 out of 10 - Service sucks: no one said hi when we walked in and the waiters/waitresses look like they were too over-worked to want any more customers - the reluctant service is notable - Lesson learned, won't be back to pay $50 for lunch for the highly disappointed foods...won't be recommending this place to anyone either."}
{"text":"We have been waiting 45 for our rolls. They said the kitchen is backed up but its empty.  When I finally received one out of ten rolls it was cold when it was a baked roll   When our order finally started coming out they forgot half the rolls   This is ridiculous but we are being patient because we are sooooo hungry.    An hour later still waiting    We asked for our bill and they charged for all you can eat when we each got one roll due to the lack of service   Not sure what is going on but I hope they figure it out.  The table next to us were complaining about the same thing we were. They are so upset."}
{"text":"Really good food!  I have been four times for lunch now.  My daughter gets the all you can eat sushi and tells me its great.  I get the bento box which has a little of everything (really like the asian skirt steak).  The tempura is really good too.  All of the sushi chefs say hello when you enter and good bye when you leave which is a nice touch.  It is a little dark inside though but most people probably like that."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat out a lot and Oyshi Sushi is one of our favorite places, but our ONLY favorite sushi place. Best all you can eat. We get the Ahi Poke, Baked Mussels, Surf and Turf, Chicken Teriyaki, and Miso soup for appetizers.  The Japanese Lasagna, Atomic Bomb, and Lobster Fair are a must!    Always busy here so plan ahead. I think it's worth the wait though!  Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 7 years... my favorite sushi spot. However,  tonight I've decided I'm going to start going elsewhere. Service has declined and the wait for food has become too long.  :("}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot thus far in Las Vegas! They have this awesome VIP room that can seat 10-12 people with a plasma tv. They offer all you can eat which is my kinda sushi spot! The quality of the sushi is awesome! They offer rib eye steak with shrimp, raw oysters, fresh sweet shrimp (along with the shrimp heads deep fried upon request yummmmm!) and dessert included with the all you can eat! Some times the waiter(s) cant believe how much I order and consume but its because their sushi/food is that bomb!! A must go n enjoy if you live in or even visiting Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Food is always amazing. Props to the chefs. The hostess here is dumb. We walked in, she brought us to a table w out asking if we wanted the bar. When we told her wanted the bar she said it'll take her a few minutes. The bar was empty!! This place was empty. Why a few minutes? After leaving us waiting at the podium she clocks out and tells her fellow employees bye. While we are just standing there. So we sat ourselves. Idiot."}
{"text":"Went for AYCE. Food was good, service (today) was terrible.   Our waiter was quick to take our first order but then disappeared for quite some time afterward...even the other tables in the same section began to complain. The only time he was prompt to act was in collecting his tip (which would have been less had we not been a party of 6)  Still have love for Oyshi, but it's unlikely that it'll be our first choice for AYCE in the future."}
{"text":"We waited an hour to get a table, after they told us it was a 30 minute wait. The table next to us arrived after us and left before us. Our table watched the next table get served diligently while we had trouble getting our waitress' attention. Note, our party was starving. When they did bring our food, the waiter's seemed as if they had some attitude. We had a problem with our absentee waitress all the way til we left. We spent about 3 hours in the restaurant. All in all, service was horrible, NOT coming back!!! AND they charged us 18% tip, which is undersrved! Had to ask for our check and walk the bill to them to pay."}
{"text":"Amazing Service!! Amazing Food!!! The environment is also Amazing! What more can you ask for! If you love to eat sushi and want all you can eat this is the place to go to!! My favorite is the rib eye, poke, and simply shrimp roll! Check it out and you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"AYCE Reasonably priced - stylish ambience and decent service... Huge selection of rolls and side menus so if you like non traditional Japanese sushi/food, by all means, go and stuff your face! I went there for traditional nigiri, so it was disappointing because of the selection and quality. I know they would charge me for not eating what I ordered, so I literally had to shove the last piece of mackerel: it smelled so fishy, I almost puked."}
{"text":"Like Soyo, I've been going to Oyshi since 2012.  Like all sushi restaurants, there is that all you can eat option.  Take it.  You'll be happy that you did.  sure there may be a few restrictions on what you can order, but when you have the ability to eat whatever the hell it is you want from the sushi and rolls sections, who cares?  Just remember, if you dine there, ask for Vincent as your server.  He's awesome."}
{"text":"**if you're a sushi snob please do yourself a favor and move along by picking another restaurant from your yelp search result. ;) **  if you're less critical and like a variety of sushi and rolls then this just might be your spot. this little gem is definitely located off the beaten path and was suggested to me by one of my best friends who used to live in vegas. like most restaurants in vegas the most accessible/convenient places are pretty much buffets so i was a bit hesitant when i heard this is ayce (all you can eat). okay i'm not gonna lie...my first response was a NO to the idea of ayce, but fortunately my group and i caved when our pick was closed for some reason.  i've been here three times now and they've all been enjoyable experiences. the staff there were not only friendly (a must), but ATTENTIVE. our waitress checked on us frequently, but not to the point of annoyance. lastly, oyshi is not just a good place for sushi, but you also don't feel gouged when you're done...  helpful suggestions:  -this restaurant is off the 215 freeway so plan your transportation wisely;  cabbing it over there might be a bit expensive.  -make reservations if you can as they can be extremely busy, but if you can't then go early. my group showed up around 6'ish and was seated immediately _barely_ missing the dinner rush.  -the menu selections are pretty big so try not to make multiple orders of the same item so you can try different things. this is also important because not all their items are fresh, like uni or oysters."}
{"text":"The noodle bento box comes with medium sized bowl noodles and mixed tempura. tempura was crispy and well done. We also had the tuna chirashi, which was interesting that it was served on a plate and came out in cubes and not slices. Not a big fan of that. Had the spicy salmona and tuna roll which was really good. overall, all dishes came out in good size and portion however, the price was quite high for what it was. The service is friendly and there are divided walls available for private dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened a couple years ago.  It used to be my spot, but lately they just don't seem to care.  Last time I was in it took forever for someone to seat us and there were multiple open seats with no one in front of us.  The service was just plain bad.  We had multiple servers who couldn't keep my wife's order straight(not a sushi eater) but always loved their Teriyaki Chicken Skewers.  They either change their teriyaki recipe or screwed up and put something else on it because it wasn't teriyaki. Food quality declined.  The specialty rolls seems to consist of more mayo based sauces than other ingredients.  Had to go through 3 different people to find the person to give me my check.    I noticed that many of the guys who I would always see working there in the past weren't there, maybe a coincidence or maybe not.    By the way Oyshi management-having your employees sleeping one off in the V.I.P. lounge in plain sight of customers is just irresponsible and lazy."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in Las Vegas to eat sushi, and I've tried a few in order to find the cheapest one a student can afford. I love coming for their AYCE, and ordering Lasagna roll, poke, baked mussels, oysters, Oyshi scallop... and for dessert their delicious green tea mochi."}
{"text":"The BEST sushi in town! It is a favorite spot for me and my friends. Have introduced some friends and clients to there from out of state, and it has now become a staple restauraunt whenever they come into town!   Has a VIP room and a conference room for larger parties. Plasmas on the walls to watch the games and fights!  The staff is ultra friendly and is always around to check out how you are doing. has both all you can eat for lunch and dinner as well as entree, appetizer and dessert items!"}
{"text":"My cousin took me here before I left the country and it was delicious!  We ate so much we had a hard time walking out of the place :)  The prices were good and the selection was great.  Everything tasted fresh and they had some good flavors as well.  If you like sushi, you should give this place a try, it is better than anything else that I tried in Vegas while living there."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Yes the wait times can get crazy, but that's because they're in high demand.  Here are some tips: get there before 6pm if you don't want a long wait, and if you are eating AYCE, go ahead and order the next round when they drop the first (don't wait until you're done eating or you'll be waiting awhile).  Also, you can't go wrong with the Ian Special!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Mika  took care of us,  a table of 8, and everything was spot on.  Amazing service along with amazing food."}
{"text":"Oyshi is not a fancy smancy sushi restaurant, but  It will definitely please your stomach if you are hungry .Plenty of sushi to choose from and side dishes as well. All time favorite side dish has to be surf and terf which consist of fried steak and shrimp handed it to you still sizzling! One of the best sushi rolls is the love affair because tt has some lobster in it ;).   Their alcohol prices are reasonable for the portions they serve you. It can be slow at times when its busy, but definitely worth the wait. Every time i go they, it seems like i'm in a club since they play house or clubbing music lol. A great place to go but not in a large group.   Great place overall :-(D"}
{"text":"I just love this place, best Sushi place in Las Vegas. Price, food and service are the best."}
{"text":"Really not impressed at all. Had a group set a reservation for about 30 people. We were sat on time in a table that would accommodate us all. Wow nice. Here is the bad part. They obviously knew we were coming and had only 1 waiter for us. Yes he took 30 some orders and the just walked out of the kitchen screaming out what rolls he had asking who wanted them. Almost an hour later I got my meal. The restaurant was great but the service was severely in need. I ate 2 rolls paid my $40. For my all you can eat sushi witch I have to say forcing a gratuity I am happy to do but this was crap. Really don't recommend going there with a group of any size."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!! Excellent AYCE!! I'm in love with the Catercheese roll! Great place plus they're open until 2am!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good with good service and atmosphere. Now, hands down the WORST thing about Oyshi is the SERVICE. We have given this place multiple chances thinking something would change, but it just keeps getting worse. Unless you speak the language there, they don't care about your service. It's so frustrating to be sitting there for 30min, with nothing but a drink, and seeing so many others (who even come in after you) get served their food. Never again is this place worth our time or money. Definitely DO NOT recommend Oyshi if you're looking for good food or even relatively descent service"}
{"text":"The worst place ever my family and I went for sushi there and 3 out of the 5 of us got food poisoning so bad that I missed work for 2 days. It Was horrible and when I called in to let them know that something may have been wrong there food the manager told me well that's too bad and hung up on me   I would never go here again and unfortunately prob turned off sushi for a while   The service was horrible and then the food I have heard bad things from others as well and some swear by it that they would never go there again. I guess it's a hit and miss situation with this sushi place"}
{"text":"Great, fresh food but service and timing of the food being served was not that good. Be sure you are not on a time constraint when coming here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places. They have a wide variety and love the surf and turf. Atmosphere is awesome. Love, love, love it!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has wonderful sushi! You order, they make it and it comes straight to the table. They have alot of good rolls and tons to choose from. Plus their all you can eat isn't super pricy and everything on the menu is included except sashimi. The only problem with the all you can eat is it is regular sized rolls so its worth it if your a big eater. I only made it to two rolls but my husband had at least 8! The service was really freindly as well. I will be going back next time we go out for sushi."}
{"text":"We've gotten their various dinner/bento box/sashimi combos after our friend took us here... claiming it's the only decent place in walking distance to their condo on Queens Quay. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food.  One trick while eating here is subbing in the Californian rolls for spicy tuna / spicy salmon in any combo that has the Californian rolls. Californian rolls are for hippies.  All in all it's a pretty good sushi place that will fill you up for $15-20. For downtown, it's pretty good!  Service - 7/10 Value - 9/10 Ambiance - 6/10 Quality - 7/10"}
{"text":"I would give the food 5 stars but I had something strange happen to me the two times I was there and I'll never go back because of it.   Both times I was there I was picking up take-out. The first time I was picking up my food, the total was something like $19.20 and I gave the very polite man a $20 bill. He didn't bring me any change, but asked me if I wanted something to drink while I waited. I though maybe when he brought me my food, he would give me my change but he didn't. I was going to tip him but since he never even mentioned my change, I let that be his \"tip\".   The next and last time I went I got to go food again. It was the same guy and he took my order and the total was $43.50. I have him $45. So this is actual paper money now so I thought he would totally bring me my money back this time. Again, very polite, asked me if I wanted something to drink.....and never mentioned my change again! It's not the money that bothered me, it's the assumption that really irritates me. Now you may ask, why didn't I just ask for my change. Well it's kinda simple, why should i have to! He lost a customer and a word of mouth review for $1.50.   I was almost tempted to try this theory again and pay for something with a $100 and see what the result would be. Does he only keep a certain amount of money, would something over $20, $40 $50 be pushing his luck....  So in short, the food is pretty good, the thieving man is very polite but I don't like when someone just assumes that my change is his tip."}
{"text":"Good service. But the last order we had put in took a long while to get.  Lounge area was blowing cold a/c. Nice place but needs a little touches here and there."}
{"text":"Best. Sushi. Ever.  Hands down my favorite sushi spot. The sushi chefs are so much fun and they have the most amazing specialty rolls. Every visit is a different experience and they never disappoint. For the best experience sit down at the sushi bar and ask your sushi chef what his specialty dish is.... I promise you it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Quite expensive No sweet or fruit at the end of meal Sushi and sashimi with 8 California roll but found only 2 are California roll with rest minced salmon or tuna roll"}
{"text":"Food is good music is terrible. RAP music is terrible making it a not kid friendly resteraunt"}
{"text":"The AYCE is amazing! It includes appetizers, sushi and desser. They have a huge variety of rolls and they are delicious!"}
{"text":"Fair priced sushi.  Sashimi is good, not great.  The staff was on top of things and coming around to make sure we were happy.  A good joint for a quick fish fix!"}
{"text":"Best AYCE Sushi in town. Try their berry parfait for dessert!"}
{"text":"My rating is bias on the food, that is why I gave 3 stars.  My friends and I originally game to that side of town for Goyemon, the wait was 1.5 hour, so we decided to head down to Oyshi to check out.  All the rolls were mediocre, nothing too special to make me crave to return to that specific location anytime soon.  A couple of stuff they could lay off the yum yum sauce, Kami-Kaze had so much yum yum it looked like pasta sheets as garnish lol.  The fish to rice ratio on the nigiri sushi was really good.  Service was another story.  We waited around 45 mins or more for our first round to come out....even the oyster apps.  Go figure why thier AYCE time limit is 2hrs, not the usually 1hr.  Our server wasn't the greatest, but she did follow up on us when she could.  I noticed she was busing several tables, which is probably why she never followed up with the food and why she was tired.  I have done that, so I know the feeling.  the facility needs to either have the host bus, or have someone to."}
{"text":"So we walk in and see a bunch of servers walking around and eventually one of them comes up and points to our table.  Whatever... We sit down, order our drinks and our first order..all was fine till then.  After we order, a good 10 minutes pass by while I observed the chefs, servers, and tables.   There were about 4 other tables and 3 of them were finished.  The one table next to us seemed to be about midway into their meal which seemed like hours between dishes.  They get one dish, finish it, then wait for another 5 minutes for the server to bring their next order. They looked irritated. And so about 20 minutes of watching 4 or 5 chefs looking busy, we get our first order.  After we finish through our first order we order maybe 4 more orders of nigiri. (Which shouldn't take more than 3 minutes) And by then all tables were gone and about 5 people at the bar. So I expected it to come quick. Nope...20 minutes later we get our last order and by then I was fed up with everything.  There were about 6 servers(why??) and they seemed more excited about talking to each other than even looking to see if the customers were okay.   Nigiri was like 80% rice 20% fish which you can expect from a Korean run sushi restaurant.  And of course they charge you if you leave rice.  How else would they make money? Not by quality, that's for sure.   Overall, the worst experience at an AYCE sushi restaurant.   If you want quality food and service, I'd recommend xtreme sushi.  Best sushi I've had in vegas by far."}
{"text":"Our first time here and had the AYCE sushi and it was very good! And our waiter Andre was awsome! Very attentive,  nice and knowledgeable.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place has the best sushi! I usually go all the way to a kona grill to eat but I have this place a chance cuz it's closer to where I live now and omg... it's amazing!!! Highly recommend! I gave 3 stars because the service sucks. They don't listen. They forget half your order and when reminding them they act like it's such an inconvenience to have it fixed. Other than that, the food is great!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. It was a Saturday around 5pm. We had AYCE sushi which was $27 per person. We ordered the sea urchin, tiger roll, rainbow roll, spider roll, shrimp tempura, hawaiian roll and some other appetizers. He sea urchin was very good - tasted very fresh. The tiger roll was also pretty good. The spider roll was a little weird - first it was cut super thin and fell apart when I would try and pick it up. Then it had bits of hard pieces. At first I thought it was rice that was dried out then I realized it was pieces of tempura batter from the shrimp which makes me think the shrimp tempura used in the roll was not fresh.  And then the rainbow roll seemed very dry for some odd reason.   The place was clean. Service was good and I liked the fact that it wasn't super small or super crowded like many sushi places In the area."}
{"text":"AYCE is awesome.  Contains more items than you would usually find.    Order is simple and the food comes out super quick.  Can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! During the week they do lunch specials, which is only $10 for my fav, the teriyaki chicken. It's amazing! Never had teriyaki chicken like this and so good!! It also comes with California rolls, fried vegetables, salad (I don't care for, I substitute it for white rice) AND miso soup. Way more than I can eat but I try! They also have jalapeño poppers, which are not your ordinary jalapeño poppers. They are my FAV. I could eat them everyday, all day. Also, fav sushi rolls-- spicy tuna crunch, love affair, full moon. They are all spectacular. Their ice cream parfait dessert is also fantastic. All you can eat is great but doesn't include jalapeño poppers so I don't usually get it unless I'm in the mood for a big variety. I also love their egg rolls. Before I came here I HATED sushi! And seafood. Now I LOVE sushi, mainly only there's. basically everything is amazing here. I don't like how loud the music is, but if you ask they'll turn it down. Waiters are nice & atmosphere is very japanese (which I LOVE, love Japan & their culture!)"}
{"text":"Lousy service up front. Each and every time I come to this place, the front service person is rude and unprofessional. The sushi is great, but not worth getting snarky remarks and attitude over."}
{"text":"The menu doesn't list the ingredients in the rolls. It might say tuna roll but doesn't say tuna and what. Like avocado or. Maybe it's just fish and rice. I don't know. The menu also doesn't designate what is spicy. I stopped in for take out. But couldn't get anyone to help me and the menu didn't give enough information so I left."}
{"text":"Seriously is the best sushi place! And so affordable...and all the time fresh. My fav pace to go eat..i come here like once a month."}
{"text":"It was an unfortunate experience.  We wanted to order the kampachi and the chef advised that he wasn't comfortable serving it - although it was listed on their \"specials\"  board.  Guess what it really means is this is the fish we really wanted to get rid of.  Rest was just ok at best.  Too bad - so many other places near here so we won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service. There's nothing special with the food. Fish is not fresh. Not enough varieties with the AYCE menu."}
{"text":"BOMB food for all you can eat.  You don't have to lower your standards because it's  AYCE.  It takes some time for them to bring out your food, so do yourself a favor and put in a couple choices so there's a steady flow of sushi coming.  There's so many good ones, I can't pick a favorite.  Be patient, cause they do tend to get backed up."}
{"text":"Good & decent lunch specials! However, I had to knock a couple stars because waitress came to our table at least 3 times & did not bother to fill water glasses. And we had to remind her for our roll that comes with lunch entreè! Fish was ok, not that fresh!"}
{"text":"Wife called ahead for pick up order of 2 rolls and was told 10-15 minutes. I arrived 18 minutes after she hung up and was asked to take a seat at the bar by the greeter after awkwardly waiting for about a minute for anyone to even acknowledge I had come into the restaurant, not a good sign.   No bartender and place wasn't busy, a waiter did ask if I wanted water as he handed my the bill when I sat down and I replied \"it's going to take that long that I need water?\" He said should only take 5-6 minutes. After sitting for 15 minutes my to go order of 2 simple rolls ended up taking a total of about 30 minutes to put together.   Place was not busy (it was 3 pm and they had 3 sushi chefs) and I was in a big hurry (hence calling ahead) so heads up if you plan on ordering pick up, they're slow...really slow. Worst part was nobody (girl who was the \"greeter\", guy who took my money, person who handed me food) apologized for the wait, that would have gone a long way."}
{"text":"I used to live in Green Valley and there was a great AYCE place on GVP and Pebble. It's closed now. I found that out the hard way many many moons ago. We used that place as a crutch and were afraid to try a new place (for fear it would not live up to the old place standards).   I had passed Oyshi many times running errands and after driving back to the Southwest area of town, broken hearted about the closure of our \"comfort zone\" sushi venue, we decided to go to Oyshi and give it a try.   I am happy to report that we were very satisfied and have been back MANY times.   Recommendations  1. Do the AYCE. We've calculated MANY times what our meal would have cost with out AYCE and we always come up winners.  2. Don't go on Friday or Saturday nights if you are starving and just can't wait. It's busy, and that should say quite a bit about the quality. I don't mind the crowd or the wait, but sometimes my stomach wishes we had gotten there a little earlier.   Likes  1. House music in the background  2. TVs behind the sushi bar for the sports fans.  3. Ample bar seating - we ALWAYS sit at the bar 4. Extensive menu 5. Chef willing to let you make up your own rolls :)  We try to hit up Oyshi once a month or more if the Sushi cravings are just to hard to resist. I highly recommend. Yum (salivating as I write this)"}
{"text":"Always busy but awesome food. My hubby is a yelper, so read his detailed review(s) (Dan N.) . Must get the Atomic Bomb!"}
{"text":"The all-you-can-eat is to die for!!! Be prepared to spend $40 for drinks and all you can eat but it's totally worth it. They have a wonderful selection ranging from mild to WAY spicy. It's definitely worth your time, I'm going back soon!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family for the AYCE lunch deal. I think the food is okay. I ordered the lava roll, yakitori beef skewers, tempura, lobster fair, seaweed salad, baked mussels, and sizzling rib eye steak. Out of everything I ordered, the stand out would have to be the baked mussels. They were absolutely addicting. If I could, I would eat a whole plater of those mussels by myself. The lobster fair was indeed a great affair in my mouth. My brothers and I attacked the entire plate within seconds. The lava roll was good for a AYCE standard. However, I was pretty disappointed about the sizzling ribeye steak. It was rather dry and lackluster.  I wasn't fond of the customer service. It was pretty slow due to the lack of staff during, but I wouldn't blame them since it's Christmas Eve. The longer the wait, the more discouraged I felt to order more food. I've been to other AYCE Asian restaurants with better food and better service. Overall, a decent dining experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. We had the AYCE for lunch. You can't get some items for lunch,  only for dinner i.e. Uni. The service was very good. Our server was Jay and he was on point with placing our orders and topping of our drinks. He missed some of our orders but nothing drastic.  I suggest you eat here with 4 or more so you can split the rolls. They only do half rolls at the sushi bar.  The place is very spacious and they have private rooms.  I like this place and I will probably be back."}
{"text":"First time here, I am a visitor from southern California! I enjoyed the sushi very much! It was so fresh and delicious. I will definetly return when I come back to visit my best friend. All the staff was welcoming and courteous. Our waiter (can't recall his name) was very helpful and offered good choices for our party to try!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Although I'm not allowed to eat a lot of the food there, the menu has some great sushi. They have great All-you-can-eat prices!! They also have a kid's menu and other food that is not sushi.   The place is very nice! It's clean and spacious! They have a bar as well."}
{"text":"I eat sushi probably two times a week and I love trying new places around my area. I have tried this place three times and each time I have gone there the service was so HORRIBLE that I will NEVER go back. It took me 15 minutes for me to even have someone come greet my table and another 15 min to order. Now I would understand the long wait if it was around lunch or dinner time but this was at 2 in the afternoon on a weekday. When I finally ordered it took about another 45 minutes to even get my salad and sushi. They forgot some of my order and at this point I was done. The second time I went I was there for dinner and the same thing happend but a longer wait! The manager came over and took off our salad which only cost us 4.00, I would assume for such bad service that they would have tried to make us a little more happy but comp'ing off one salad was no acceptable. I will never go back there and I advise you all not to either!"}
{"text":"Really best sushi in Vegas! Sometimes when I didn't have time to wait cause the wait line  was very long , i tried other sushi bars but honestly i always regret i didn't wait for Oyshi ... Everything is just yummy!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and incredibly fast service. Our chef Mike was awesome! Definitely knew his stuff and was quick to offer suggestions. It's no wonder we're regulars."}
{"text":"It's true...I have fallen hard for yet another sushi place. AYCE, super unique rolls and here's the kicker...a very cool vibe! If you've ever been eating sushi and thought to yourself, this would be so much better with some Tiesto playing, this is your spot!  First off, don't be discouraged by the wait. They're busy and you should be happy for them. It's usually no more than 15 minutes and you can occupy yourself by practicing new dance moves. We always sit at the sushi bar and the service is friendly and fast. I once saw no less than 6 sushi chefs hustling in that narrow space so you'll be well taken care of.   On to the tasty stuff. What I like most about this joint is if you like deep fried, baked, raw, hot, mild, funky they've got you covered. I hate places that are all cooked or all raw, you've gotta people please!  From the freshness of the fish, to the sauces they're paired with it's all a win. Their all you can eat knows almost no bounds so if you're not busting at the end you've done something wrong. To top it all off the strawberry ice cream they serve is surprisingly top notch, little strawberry swirl through it and everything.   They also have 2 private rooms for large parties and I know this because I spied on them when I was there like a creeper. Try this place out next time you're in the southwest. We were happy to find it on our side of town and not have to venture to Sushi Blvd aka Eastern."}
{"text":"Just awful sushi. Mostly tried nigiri. The rice was not seasoned correctly. The fish was dry. The uni was grey. They served the eel with eel sauce on the same plate as other sushi getting the eel sauce onto the other nigiri. Multiple orders of appetizers failed to arrive. Service was slow."}
{"text":"I went to return movies at Blockbuster with my younger son and had the urge for some sushi. Since Oyshi was just across the street from Blockbuster, we stopped in for a quick sushi fix. I've been to Oyshi many times in the past, but this visit will be my last. Service at Oyshi in the past sucked, but tonight's service was just plain unacceptable.  Being a server myself, I strive to be polite, easy, PATIENT, understanding, and tip well. When my son and I walked in, we waited a good 5 mins as the manager and servers walked passed us and no one even cared to seat us. I finally flagged down a server to seat us. If the establishment was busy, that's a different story, but this was at 10pm on a Thursday with only three other tables. The girl that sat us gave us menus and asked if we were doing AYCE and I responded, \"No\"(I didn't want to stuff myself this late at night). I ordered water and told her I was ready to order, but she said she's not my server. 5 mins passed and our server came to take our drink order, and I told her I was ready to order. I ordered two waters, a miso soup, and 2 simple rolls. The waters and soup came in a timely manner, but I had to flag down a server for a spoon, straws, settings, and soy sauce.  We waited, waited, and waited(@ least 30 mins), saw other customers get their food-while thinking...did they forget our rolls??? I lost patience and called the server over & told her if they haven't yet made our rolls, I wanted to cancel. She glared at me then went over to tell the sushi chef, and he miraculously & immediately passed her a plate with our rolls! What the heck?? While we were waiting forever for our rolls, the sushi chef had them. We never even got an apology for the delay. Not once were we asked if we were ok or needed anything or even got a refill. As soon as we got our rolls, we gulped them down, asked for the check, paid, and bounced!! The rolls were mediocre. Being a good tipper, I left absolutely nothing for such horrible service(from the beginning to the end) :-/."}
{"text":"This place is amazing the sushi is amazing rolls are Incredible the service is fantastic!! Loving the atmosphere and the music. We live in Los Angeles and we come here everytime were in town..I'd recommend this place and    ED THE BEST SUSHI CHEF EVER all day long!"}
{"text":"Had a Great time here and had nice service, we got a  private room for our friends Birthday and the service was really friendly and quick ... And I know my group could be a lot to handle at times too ... They did make the stipulation that we could have the private room for 15 ppl if MOst of the group did all u can eat !!"}
{"text":"Its been awhile sinced i yelped but i feel that this experience was had to be reviewed. The outside building was charming an the inside felt cozy with a warm atmosphere. Were we greeted with a smile and told there was a wait. Then after we were seated the illusion were off an the nightmare started. Service was less to be desired an often times i was interupted with audible weird sound?? Feeling quite awkward I proceeded to order few sushi rolls and appetizers.  The shrimp tempura was not light and flaky. It tasted more like it coated with a heavy batter an was served not pipin hot but luke warm? The pink lady sushi roll look like my nephew (5yrs old) learned how to make sushi for the first time  The Pokie has three pieces of light colored Ahi Tuna with seaweed and abundance of white onion on the bottom.   Then to make matter worse 5 piece roll, coco roll, an mango roll all over sized pieces that could even fit in your mouth. The fish quality was very poor. Also tasted either salty or extremly sweet.  So i started to look around an noticed that the staff at the sushi bar; food runner who brought the food was just not in a pleasent mood.  They all seemed to give off a tired overworked type of mood. Waiter/waitress haphazardly put the plates anywhere and not clearing the table first of any dishes. My friend ordered the desert. She being brave (lol) ordered the green tea ice cream and that was overspun.   Inconclusion i had high hopes of this place especailly how inviting it seemed on the outside. Alas very disappointed and won't be dinning here anymore. Gave it 2 stars for hostess who greeted us promplty with a smile."}
{"text":"I used to live right down the street from this restaurant and still wouldn't go there because of the slow service. The only time the service was good was when it was slow. Knowing this, I would just get to go orders and never had any problems with that.   Fast forward about 1 year... I was excited to eat here because I was sure they would have their sh*t together by now. Boy was I wrong... Our first round took FOREVER AND A DAY and our server forgot a couple things I had ordered so I ordered once again. I swear saw her scribbling on her notepad while I was telling her what I would like to eat next.  It is quite possible that she was just jotting things down for the grocery store after her shift. We decided to order dessert from the waitress at the next table so that we could have it right after the rest of the sushi came. So, dessert came and we decided to let the creme brûlée sit there on our table until the rest of our sushi came. To our surprise the sushi and our waitress was nowhere to be found!!! A long while later I asked another waitress if she could check on our other sushi orders and she informed is that there were none and she could take our order if we wanted more. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THIS HAPPENED IN ONE VISIT!!! I tried to give this place another chance and I just feel silly for expecting something better from a place that can't offer anything better than horribly slow service. They deserve NO stars but the sushi that actually made it to the table was okay.  Don't waste your time going here... Drive to Goyemon, SushiMon, or Sushi Twister. I promise, even though the drive is further it'll take even longer to wait around for sushi here."}
{"text":"Dear \"Golden Boy\",  Maybe you had an off day but I was really disappointed with my AYCE dinner with you today. Upon sitting down there was rice on our chairs. 2 out of the 3 menus have some sauce and brown wet spots all over we wiped off ourselves. Water came out slow. The baked rolls came out lukewarm. The baked mussels were lukewarm. Nothing was hot. Even fried Agedashi tofu was warm. The only hot foods was the kids menu item we ordered (popcorn chicken and miso soup). The busser with the goatee was exceptional. He brought out everything I asked for right away (soysauce, the rice and soup that came with the kids meal). Our plates were not cleared and no one cared to move it when bringing it more food and our table is full of empty dishes already. I had to ask them to clear it. It wasn't a busy night. There were plenty of empty tables and maybe you were understaffed. Regardless, being over polite doesn't make up for subpar service. The tables being serviced by other servers who sat down after us got their food before us. How is that possible when theirs was fried and baked items that take time? You brought me the check even though I was still missing an order. I hope you enjoyed my eels. I came to this location because I've had multiple good experiences at the rainbow location. I should have kept driving and went to Sushi Mon like I originally intended to. Had a really disappointing time tonight. Hope you guys live up to your name so as to not mislead any more people coming for the Oyshi brand of standards.  Another food review: The caterpillar roll which has nothing to do with you had really over cooked, dry and tough eel."}
{"text":"Run by Koreans. Excellent food. Not the most cordial welcome although they were extremely busy which should speak volumes."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Excellent food! Kevin is a great server with excellent customer service skills. He engages the guests and keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot-fast, good quality and affordable but make a reservation for lunch if you want to make sure you get in since they only have a handful of tables-gyozas and lobster tempura roll are yummy!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times with my family because of it's convenience in location and the wait time is pretty minimal. The food is decent if you're not a fish snob. I don't even think sashimi is served. All the rolls are heavily seasoned/ sauced-up and majority of them are stuffed with imitation crab (basically different variations of the california roll). I tried a spicy tuna handroll and the fish was not fresh so I had to return it (since you're charged for not eating everything that's ordered from the \"all you can eat\").  I stick with non-sushi items such as the udon or this teriyaki beef rice bowl. I do like the ninja meal (veggie and shrimp tempura, California roll, and teriyaki chicken) but I can only order it if my nephew comes along (for kids only-and they're really strict about it).  In fact they're so strict that my nephew ordered it and he drank a bottle of milk so he was too full to eat. They wouldn't even let us bring the kids meal home. We had to pay for it but we couldn't pack to go!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my daughter... First of all, we received shitty service from the server and chef... took 10-15 minutes for her to stop by to refill our drinks, and retake our orders everytime, we were in there from 330p-530p cuz of slow service, and it wasn't even busy... Second, either the chef doesn't know the menu or he just thought that I was too stupid to know the ingredients in the rolls I ordered cuz I ordered a heart attack roll and the menu says there's yum yum soft shell crab mix inside, I watched him make it and he put regular crab mix inside, I confronted him about it and he denied it and said he did put the soft shell crab mix in it, even though it wasn't cuz there was no soft shell crab in it... Also i ordered seared mackeral nigiri and he served it to me cold, he didn't even sear it... Not to mention they give u small cuts of fish... And 3rd, the worst part about this place... They had flies in their sushi case shittin all over their fish, I didn't even notice em til my daughter showed me... They leave their sushi cases wide open even while they're just standing there with no orders, everyone knows ur supposed to close the sushi cases when ur not using em to prevent that from happening, and to keep the fish as cold as possible, but they just didn't give a shit, I can almost guarantee they're running a dirty kitchen too...Never coming back to this place again.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I strolled into Oyshi on a weekend afternoon for some AYCE. From the moment we walked in the door the staff was rude and acted like we were bothering them from coming in. There were a few people helping us and not one of them were attentive. It took forever to refill waters and order more food. The staff was very standoffish and everyone from the management to servers to the sushi chefs looked miserable to be working there. I didn't like the atmosphere for an afternoon they were playing party music. Their quality of fish was low and didn't seem fresh. I was very disappointed with this place considering all of the reviews. I have to drive a little bit father for an AYCE sushi place now but it is well worth it, so everyone go to Sushi Koma instead!! Their staff is so friendly and the food is 100 times better!"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place  They have the best sushi in vegas  The staff are very friendly and accommodating"}
{"text":"The downfall of our favorite AYCE place???  Since it's opening, my wife and I have patronized Oyshi on S. Rainbow.  For most of this time, the service levels have been at a minimum adequate and mostly 4-5 star.  No longer.  Last night, one of our boys asked to go to Oyshi as he has basically been going since his birth.  Over the past few visits, we noticed a decline in customer service, less knowledgeable staff, and simply less training.  The service culture gives one the sense of barely organized chaos.  The staff is no longer efficient and organized.  It almost felt that we should feel lucky that they were there to bring our food.  Service is now merely \"dump and run\" with no real follow-up.  Dirty dishes left on table and servers were handing us new plates of food instead of removing the old to make space for the new.  The manager on duty was obviously in over his head.  We were always accustomed to the manager coming over, checking on our food as he did with everyone, and visibly managing and directing the staff.  Unfortunately, that is no longer the case.  As the owners branch out into new concepts (our understanding is they also own Soyu - Korean Barstaurant in the same strip center as well as some other concepts), the better managers (and possibly staff) are going as well.  Problem is, they are not leaving competent (or at least not well-trained) folks behind.  Sad to see.  Oyshi had a great run for a few years.  However unless they get their act together this particular location is headed down a steep slope with no brakes."}
{"text":"Food was great but service was a little strange. You don't order your food from the sushi chef you have to order from the waitress. Also we ordered 3 rolls and some sushi, you would think the sushi comes out first? But they brought out all the rolls and forgot about the sushi until we mentioned we never got it. Overall they're fish quality was great, everything tasted fresh and not fishy :) will be back and they're AYCE is a great deal with a lot of selection :)"}
{"text":"The service is horrible !  I've been here before and the sushi wasnt so good but I decided to give it another shot. Bad idea! I was on lunch break ordered two rolls and there. Were five sushi chefs. It wasn't even busy! Took thirty minutes to get my order right and the sushi was just plain messy.  I should've gone to Kobe down the street."}
{"text":"We moved into the neighborhood a few months ago and have been to Oyshi several times. The miso soup and the tempura veggies are delicious. overall this is some of the best sushi we've had. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review is because the shrimp aren't fried to order for the rolls. The tiger roll is usually one of my favs but not when the shrimp are soggy."}
{"text":"I come here for sushi when I'm craving a solid AYCE menu with a lot of raw fish options. I find if you sit at the sushi bar and just ask the chefs for your order the menu is not very stringent and they are happy to really make you anything you ask for. I found the service of our waitress to be pretty bad. My drink was only refilled once and she was very inattentive. Quality of fish is always good and have never had a problem besides how full I leave. The other options are also very good, I always order the seaweed salad and seared ribeye steak which comes on a sizzling hot pan with cabbage and onions and is a great option on the AYCE menu for those that love a surf and turf. I say the food is great for the price, and the place is only getting 4 for the value I got which is something I look for. But the service was lacking. Still worth a trip!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular at this location for over 5 years.  The quality of service has declined steadily over the years - especially the hostess position.  The people they hire are the absolute laziest, who seem more interested in networking than providing actual service.  After checking-in with the host and being told \"about a 20 minute wait,\" I watched people who arrived after me be seated.  After 30 minutes, I asked how is it possible that everyone was seated before me?  The hosted blamed the manager who took my name, but never added me to the wait list.  It seems like whenever you go there, it is a '20 minute wait' even though there are plenty of empty tables.  The food is AWESOME - once you get it - and that's the ONLY reason I keep going back."}
{"text":"My go to spot for sushi as we live in the condo across the street. Sushi is decent, tempura udon is great but the tuna/spicy tuna/salmon/spicy salmon \"domes\" keep me coming back for more!  Prices are good for Toronto!"}
{"text":"The best AYCE sushi place. Never disappoints. The nuclear bomb is amazing. The fish is so fresh. Even if you don't like sushi, you can have their ribeye steak, skirt steak, so many choices. The staff is always friendly. If you still have room, try the parfait or the cream brûlée."}
{"text":"My husband and I have a new favorite place in town. We live in Summerlin and still drive to the Southwest side of town for sushi.  Portions for AYCE would fool you. Sushi pieces are generous and balls of rice are not enormous. The appetizers are good, you have to try Grilled beef asparagus!  Staff is friendly and do their best on busy nights. Make sure you call for reservations on weekend nights.   Also, you can order half rolls from the sushi bar, not tables. So if we go, just the 2 of us, we will sit at the bar."}
{"text":"I love this place beyond love. We eat here every time we are in Vegas. I wish I could box them up and take them back with us to NC. I love all the rolls but my all time favorite roll is the Love Affair. The crunchy topping with the sauce is absolutely amazing. When we lived here we ate here almost every single week. I highly recommend everyone eat here. The all you can eat is the best deal in town by far. It's off the strip always but TRUST ME it's worth it!!!"}
{"text":"ayce is the best. great flavor. less one star though because 3 times we did ayce, food was really sloooow to come out from the kitchen."}
{"text":"I usually go to oyshi often but the last time i went the service i had was extremely horrible... so ever since my last visit i never went back... dont get me wrong but the sushi there is really good but they just gotta work on the service... i could of seriously just walked out and they would not notice..."}
{"text":"Love this place.. Decor.Nice.Clean. Great vibes from everyone Have been here three time. Great dining experience. Food is excellent. There is a charge if you dont finish your order. The hostess was nice enough to charge us one time.. We had three orders of Rolls that we didnt finish. Left a 25% because the hostess was fantastic! Will be returning."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place doesn't have 5 stars. I am an avid sushi eater and this place is awesome! Really great rolls, good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Been going to this place since it first opened.  David always takes care of us.  This place is always fresh & has high quality AYCE sushi, that rivals non-AYCE places!  Huge assortment and great appetizers too!  Awesome & friendly staff.  It can get super busy, so we usually just slip in and take a seat at the bar rather than waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Love it , very yummy variety and fresh made sushi!!! Havent been here in years happy to be back"}
{"text":"Ate here 2x with the fam while visiting Vegas. 2nd time we decided to go with the All You Can Eat, and it was well worth it. If you're hungry, go for this one. They have a large menu, portion is good, price maybe $1-$2 more than what you may be used to. Service starts off slow, but once your first order comes out, everything else will follow. I know we'll be coming here whenever when in town."}
{"text":"I would say Oyshi is the 2nd best AYCE Sushi so far in my books!   Pros: The quality of the food is fresh and delicious. Good customer service. They can accommodate large groups if you plan to throw a get together. Some menu highlights - they have AWESOME selections of sizzling iron plates of Steak Teriyaki, Chicken Teriyaki, and Grilled Salmon. (Unlimited too!) Annnd there Calamari and Popcorn Scallops are so yummy!  Cons: NO HALF-ROLLS available except if you eat at the sushi bar. Getting your sushi orders takes a long time! We waited for over a half an hour after putting our order for sushi, so I recommend that you know what you want and putting in a large order."}
{"text":"This place is awesome everything is good ask the chef for special made hand rolls they're off the hook"}
{"text":"Geez - the service has really gone to shit !  4 of us for dinner last night.  2 had AYCE, 2 didn't .  Server had attitude from the beginning - my sense is a combination of being annoyed by the questions, that we all didn't get AYCE and I was the only one drinking .  We were told the problem was the kitchen was backed up .... Really ?  More like the kitchen was fucked up and the server was backed up and someone needed to stick their foot up her ass to cleanse her of the crappy attitude.  The food ?  Gotta admit the sushi was good - sweet shrimp, garlic tuna and Cajun tuna as well as the yellowtail were the stars.  Unagi also worked for me.  The hot dishes ?  The ones we actually got ? Calamari, popcorn scallops, asparagus beef ... Very average.  There were at least 5 dishes they never brought us.  This was a very rare occasion I didn't tip much - $95 bill, $2 tip.  Get it together OYSHI !"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for a few years now and finally getting around to reviewing it. I have only had the all-you-can-eat here, so my 4-star rating is based on quality for an AYCE setting.   Of all the AYCE places I've been to, Oyshi is definitely the best. Their variety of rolls, sushi, and appetizers is the largest. The fish is fresh and the appetizers are quite creative. I highly recommend the Red Rock Roll and Screaming Roll. For appetizers, the Ahi Poke and Agedashi Tofu is always very good. A welcomed difference from many other AYCE sushi places is that Oyshi is a very nice restaurant. It was built to be a sushi restaurant and has the ambiance of one.   Ever since I found Oyshi a few years ago, I have not gone anywhere else in town for AYCE sushi. However, it has really caught on and their business seems to be booming, especially during the peak hours. Because of that, the last couple of time I've gone there, the service has been very, very slow. I actually tried a new place recently, because I didn't want to be there for 2+hours. Outside of that, it's definitely the best AYCE place in town."}
{"text":"Terrific all-you-can-eat sushi. If you're going huge, it's definitely worth the money. Service was slow when we sat at a table but very good at the bar."}
{"text":"Scale of 1 - 10 I give it a 5 at best. The service is adequate but food takes a very long time to get. Yes, it was a busy Friday night but you know what, Friday is busy, staff up already.  The portions of food and presentation are both sub par. The flavors were good but honestly I am not impressed.  It almost feels like they just want you to eat and get out.  The atmosphere is okay. The booth that we sat in had its upholstery all torn up.  Will I go again, NO. Not with all of the sushi joints in town."}
{"text":"AYCE - all you can eat SUSHI and ROLLS (half or full)!  Awesome, definitely enjoyed the spider hand rolls to lobster fair rolls.   Thanks!"}
{"text":"Food is overall good but every roll has imitation crabmeat. I'm pretty sure this is their way of getting you full when you choose all you can eat."}
{"text":"This was my second time going to oyshi sushi with my friends and I was very disappointed. The first time I went set somewhat high expectations. The first time the food was excellent, the atmosphere was amazing, the servers were friendly, but speed of service died a little toward the end because it was busy (which is understandable). When my friends and I went yesterday for the second time, the service was below average. Although the servers were really friendly, they constantly forgot about our food. We had to remind them at least 5 times. I could look over it, but it wasn't really busy which irritated me. It was such a let down. Going to have to reconsider coming here again."}
{"text":"A nice place to eat sushi! With a large spacious dining area and a friendly staff, this makes for a good sushi spot. We ordered the Rainbow Roll and the Nuclear Bomb, both good and fun sushi rolls, but took half an hour just to get two rolls. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Had AYCE and everything was amazing! Servers and chefs were very friendly and informative. Will def be back again with friends!"}
{"text":"This is one of our go to sushi places because it's close to our house, but also because their AYCE sushi is excellent.  The fish is very fresh and flavorful, except the oysters, which I thought were a little bland.  Lately we've had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated, so this place is definitely gaining in popularity.  The menu has changed somewhat in the past year and now they have more appetizers and dessert, which is definitely a plus!  However you can only order one of the special desserts but you can have all the ice cream you want.  The rolls are solid and the uni has been fresh every time we've visited."}
{"text":"Great selection of sushi rolls, appetizers, nigiri, and other misc. items. The service and atmosphere is the reason why we come back every time when we are craving sushi. We always ask for stefan as our server cause he always provides the best customer service."}
{"text":"I did the AYCE (all you can eat) dinner for $27 and I thought it was worth it. The menu is pretty big but there are a lot of items on the menu that is not included in their AYCE meal. On top of that, you are only allowed to get one dessert. One thing that I like about this place is the fact that they don't make their rolls as if it was for 3 people. This gives you room in your tummy to try more items. Service was above average. They never fail to give you the wrong order at least once while you are dining with them. If you're looking to try a new AYCE sushi spot, try this place."}
{"text":"Ate here with some friends before going to a Japanese taiko concert, as was fitting. A little tricky to find, especially with the road construction, but well worth it. Service was very prompt and friendly, and I LOVED the traditional-styled booths (a little cramped, though. Not much space). Privacy while you eat? AWESOME. The server let me switch out avocado for cucumber in one of my rolls, which was great, because I hate that green mush. I ordered salmon roll, miso soup, and a roll that involved tempura'd lobster, yam, and row. Mmmm. Good stuff. Miso soup was great, free edamame, delicious rolls, didn't really like the tea though, it tasted wheaty. Boyfriend ordered a seafood udon and holy crap, SO much meat in it. But you have to deshell/bone it yourself. Portion sizes were very good, and the server was frequently checking up on us. And, their after-dinner candies were one of my favorites! Those chewy chocolate milk things. Mmm. I ONLY rank it four instead of five stars because there was a very noticeable hair- two, actually, in one of my rolls."}
{"text":"this is one of my favorite all you can eat sushi places in vegas! i always have oyshi cravings every time i crave sushi... i love there oyster shooters in the all you can eat. Most sushi places don't offer that.  The ambiance is pretty bumpin... they play good house music that keeps you going. The rolls are phenomenal and satisfies my cravings till I'm about till I'm about to fall over. Dessert is great i always order the green tea ice cream parfait *drools* Price is $26 for dinner and lunch is about $21 before 3:30pm..."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the other location, and liked it. But I tried this place, and I have JUST NOW recovered physically enough from the worst food poisoning I've ever heard of to write this review.  We got the all you can eat for a late dinner.  The sushi was fine, as far as I can remember.  I ordered oysters, two of them came in a little plate.  I slurped down the first one, and it tasted like a corpse soaked in brine.  Since I shoot raw oysters, it was already in, and I figured, what are the odds the second one will taste like that too?  MISTAKE.  I told my dining companions, \"Wow these taste like they've been dead for a while...\"  I forgot about it and moved on.  That night, my friend (who didn't have oysters) woke up around 1 or 2 am and puked.  She said she was fine the next day.  I was totally fine and figured her puny weakling stomach must've just not been able to handle the onslaught of all you can eat sushi.  I went about my day like a naive, unsuspecting fool.  Wednesday, around 4:00 pm.  In my office.  The rumblings of gastric distress started to bubble.  I had cooked my usual breakfast, and gotten a sandwich from my usual place.  I thought maybe the sandwich wasn't sitting right.  Within 20 minutes or so my vision started hazing, and my stomach started blowing up like that blueberry chick from willy wanka.  I felt nauseous.  Made it to my car and sped home, feeling sicker and sicker.  I bolted to my toilet and JUST made it in time as a violent torrent of vomit erupted from my face like a hurricane.  Violent wretching for several mintues, and then I slumped into my bed, exhausted.  However, there would be little sleep over the next 12 hours.  Every 10 to 15 minutes I would have explosive, violent, searing diaherrea like a poop volcano.  It started to feel dangerous after a full day of this, so I got myself to a hospital. I was diagnosed with a deadly food bacteria present in dirty seafood and prescribed antibiotics. As I got in my car to drive home I projectile vommitted in my car. I had to call a friend to take me home and pick up my meds. I was unable to get out of bed for a full 6 days, except to crawl on hands and knees to destroy my toilet every half hour or so.  Needless to say I will never eat here again.  I also can't see myself eating oysters ever again. Feeling thankful for modern medicine because this is the ish people die from.  NEVER FORGET. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Second of their restaurants. Great staff. Outstanding sushi and other fare. Really. A fun spot for dining!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi joints, great fish every time and a great menu. Service can be iffy, as they can be very busy. Knocked off one star for that. Both nigiri and rolls were delicious, the fish is very fresh and salmon is delicious. Would keep going back."}
{"text":"Slow service, limit of one dessert per person, subpar rolls and nigiri fish to rice ratio is ALL rice, no actual Japanese people anywhere to be seen (customers nor staff). Should've gone to Sushimon or Sushi on Rainbow.  This place sucks!"}
{"text":"For $26, get the all-you-can-eat menu.  The sushi is only ok and not authentic Japanese food.  The fresh oysters, ika with massago, uni, beef terriyaki, and salad are not bad.  The service and chefs are really friendly."}
{"text":"My family has been coming to oyshi for as long as I can remember. At least twice a month. But in the last year the service, staff and food has gone down hill drastically.  The food now takes a lot longer to come out and a lot of the rolls taste like they've been sitting and they started putting lemon juice type sauce on the sushi which makes everything taste horrible. They seem to have changed some rolls and not a change for the better.  Luckily our server tonight has been wonderful, but I she will not make up for the past year.   We now go to the one on Sahara and it seems to be a lot better. This location is so much closer to our house though..."}
{"text":"In my eyes the best sushi in town! I recommend getting all you can eat and try the lobster rolls. They are simply amazing"}
{"text":"First time going here and thought it was very good, sushi was fresh and the service was excellent if I'm ever on this side of town again I will definitely go back. Also there spicy mayo is really good!"}
{"text":"My first time here , we were seated right away,  it's very noisy, so good for groups but not for romantic dinners,  it did tend to be less noisy as the night went on, the sushi was delicious and totally worth the price, in fact it was a steal , all u can eat off the menu, with exception of sashimi , I will definetly be back. It's perfect for a large group, and especially for those with big appetites and those who want to try everything off the menu.. They do offer teriyaki which is tasty for those who do not like sushi..."}
{"text":"This place has all you can eat and put so much rice on each item.  Fish is not really fresh either and they use very lower quality fish. Also the server is not professional, they take away the plates we are still working on! Very rude server and very rude service! Very unpleasant experience!  A server even touched the food with his thumb when he served! Very disgusting! Obviously, the server did care about the  business! She is there to warn people about the rice left.  I just dont go back and tell people not to go here!"}
{"text":"The services was really slow at the bar, after speaking to someone twice we still were not helped. But it's AYCE and tasty ?"}
{"text":"Took us 10 minutes to be seated and there was nobody else ahead of us in line. Not at all a traditional sushi place at all with terrible costumer service"}
{"text":"Recently I placed a to go order and was quite disappointed when I got home. My food had been made incorrectly and I was frustrated usually the food is excellent and delicious. However despite the mistake, I have to give rave reviews to how the manager Wong (I think that was her name) handled the situation. When I called back to ask to be refunded because I did not want to drive back to have my order fixed she without waiting a beat jumped in to refund me and even offered to give me two complimentary rolls on my next visit. The food has always been great and mistakes happen but it is how those moments are handled that decides whether a person returns or not, and I will be for sure. Definitely recommend the Spicy Maniac roll and the Chung Hua if you like really really spicy. They are fantastic."}
{"text":"Great sushi! So far the best I've had in Vegas!  Fresh and good quality !  The restaurant is also very clean !"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live right across the street from Oyshi, and we go once a week or once every two weeks. It is soooo delicious and we crave it basically on a daily basis. Lol. I have tried other sushi places, but Oyshi is by far my favorite. I love their baked rolls and appetizers. My favorites are the hot tamale roll, the Japanese lasagna, spicy tuna crunch, potato croquette, egg rolls, Yellowstone, and quite a few others. The sushi chefs behind the bar are very nice. I rave about this place to basically everyone I know. Lol. It gets really busy during the normal dinner hours...which we typically try to avoid because it takes longer for each order to come out. The only reason I rated 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service is a hit or miss. Sometimes we get a really great server who is very attentive to us, but other times we sit there forever before a server finally notices us. Or they take forever to refill your drinks...or they take your first order and forget you're there. It is a little pricey, but so worth it! If you want to eat or try a lot of stuff, definitely go for the all you can eat!"}
{"text":"OUR FAVORITE SUSHI SPOT SINCE 2009. We've been here a few dozen times, and are never disappointed with the food or the service! The downfall is that wait times can be extensive at times depending on when you go, but average wait is 10-20 minutes... and it's oh-so worth the wait! Lunch is 22$, dinner is $27. (For children 12 and under, lunch is 16 and dinner is $19.) They use fresh ingredients, the food presentation is beautiful, the service is always great and we always leave so full & so happy! ^___^  We like to order: APPETIZERS: - Ahi poke - Calamari  - Fresh oysters (two pieces per order, one order per person only) - Dynamite (scallop, shrimp, crab mix, mushroom & onion baked w/ yum yum sauce) - Baked mussels (5 piece limit per person)  - Asian skirt steak - Yakitori shrimp & asparagus  - Rib eye steak  SUSHI ROLLS - Love affair - Vegas roll  - Premium spider - Japanese Garlic Lasagna  - Lobster Affair  - Oyshi roll  - Salmon nigiri - Unagi nigiri  DESSERT: - Green tea berry parfait - Vanilla creme brulee  - Green tea ice cream (desserts are one order per customer except for ice cream)  PRO TIP: If you have peanut allergies, you'll be happy to know they do not use ANYTHING with peanuts, none of their dressings contain it and they do not use peanut oil.  PRO TIP II: Also, For parties of 8 or more, 18% gratuity is added to the bill (this includes children and any patrons who are seated at the table, whether eating or not)."}
{"text":"The Oyshi on south rainbow blvd is one of our ultimate favorite sushi places in Vegas. Being closer to home, I swore this location would soon be one of my new frequent regulars. Needless to say, I have come here a handful of times but never had anything justifiable to review... on average could never give more than 3 stars, but after this sad encounter, I guess it's time since my rating for it has depleted.   I'm big on customer service & truly believe your server contributes to a large part of your dining experience. Our server's name was Junua, and I wish I could say one good thing about him. He was emotionless, unhelpful & scarce majority of our stay... to order or get refills from him was so difficult. It started with asking for more Splenda since all of the ones given were crunchy from being wet previously & dried. All downhill from there. The place wasn't even busy with only 4 other tables. No excuse honestly.  We ordered our usuals. I don't think it's bias, but the chefs here are just not as good as the rainbow Oyshi location. The ASIAN SKIRT STEAK was dry, the LOVE AFFAIR had not as much lobster & crab but excessive crunch flakes, and the AHI POKE was bland. The GREEN TEA PARFAIT had rock hard granola & was drenched with strawberry syrup. I couldn't even enjoy it. In terms of what was decent? The MONSTER ROLL, SPICY TUNA & SALMON NIGIRI were good.  Oh, they no longer have white tuna on their menu... and apparently there is a one order limit on their baked mussels and they have crossed out the \"multiple orders allowed\" on their ice cream? I thought this was all-you-can-eat? Lol. I think we are officially done with this place. Aside from the extremely cute decor and fun playlist, it's no wonder this place isn't busy on a Saturday.  *SIDENOTE: He had no name tag on (young black guy), but shoutout to the sweet busser who was friendly and far more accommodating than our server Junua ever was. Get that boy a raise! Our busser honestly is responsible for this being a 2 star rating instead of just 1! We appreciate you, sir."}
{"text":"Everything in the menu is delish!!!!!   Staff are all very nice and courteous, prompt and smile all the time.  I will recommend this restaurant anytime to everyone. Love their weekly lunch special can't beat that too.    Clean utensils and clean all around this place.  Real Japanese place."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this place so I try to come in whenever I can. I usually sit at the sushi bar to interact w/ the chef's and it's quicker to get your food. I've been here numerous times, but my review stems from the last few times I have come to visit. Most recently my gf & I came in for dinner and the host was not at her station so we proceeded to head to the sushi bar where I typically sit. We sat down and the hostess came to us and asked if someone sat us. We said no due to no one being at the host stand. She said I need to seat you. I informed her, we are already seated and we would like to sit here. She told us the server who worked in that area wasn't accepting tables. We asked if the server working the whole bar? She went back to the stand to look and I followed. She went to go speak w/ another employee to ask if it was okay. I'm guessing the hostess was new since she didn't know what to do. When she came back, she took us back exactly to where we originally went to sit. Pretty frustrating to say the least. So now we are under the impression we have a server. Not really though. A woman came to our seats and provided us w/ a setup and took a drink order. After that, nothing. About 8 minutes went by and the server, our server, comes up and asks us what we wanted to eat. No apology, just took our order. Once we ordered our food, everything was business as usual.  I've had spotty service here since coming here. I come for the food and that's why I sit at the sushi bar because it cuts out the time the server has to take to grab the food and deliver it. The chef just hands it to you. The best option here is the AYCE because just about everything is up for grabs. Oh and if you don't know, which most don't since it's not on the menu, you can order pork belly. It comes in a serving of 4. Even regulars that come in don't know. You're welcome :)"}
{"text":"No more sushi-mon for me -  ever.  This place has only decent service but very good food.  No sushi place can be great unless it is by the sea.  We are in the middle of the desert in America, so let's be real; this isn't Japan or Korea.  However, that being said: for Vegas it is pretty good. Not a lot of rool options, but the ones they have are tasty."}
{"text":"Dinner ordered: Spicy salmon handroll Chirashi sushi Dynamite rolls Dragon rolls  All of the above is below average in the sense that, I have had better in foodcourt sushi shops and grocery market takeout. Sushi and sashimi quality did not wow us and quality of fish is not great nor fresh. The width of the rolls were not cut evenly... We went on a Saturday night 8pm, sushi turnover might not be at peak given they probably have most customers during weekday lunch. But that should not be a customer concern. Price range is reasonable like other yelpers have raised but with this quality I would not say it lives up to its value, unfortunately.  They have great customer service, they are welcoming and kind. Every time when I say thank you, the lady would say you are very welcome to me. One thing I found quite concerning was when the bill came, it was one of those traditional handwriting bill that they filled it out themselves. I looked at it closer and I realize they built in 10% service fee in the final number and they did not even write that category out on the paper. Pretty surprised a traditional small sushi shop would go on that route, please be aware if you go and check your bill.  Sadly, would not recommend nor return."}
{"text":"Got picked up from the airport and came straight to a late night dinner. It wasn't too busy and the customer service was decent. I used to come here a long time ago and loved it. The quality of food decreased slightly and there were so many other sushi places that were better that I stopped coming.  Well my husband and I decided to come back since they are open later than other good sushi places close by. We were surprisingly satisfied. The quality seems to have gotten better. I'm definitely coming back! Sucks we couldn't order half rolls though. You can only do half rolls if you are seated at the bar. What's the difference?  I vote to have that changed!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Sat at the bar and just let Nacho (sushi chef) create his own delicious rolls. Better than the menu items"}
{"text":"I work next door and this is a popular lunch spot for us. They have a very good lunch combo which is reasonably priced and comes with a large portion of food made up of miso soup, a salad, gyoza, your choice of a sushi item and your choice of a grill item. I've had takeout from then as well, I'd rate the sushi itself as a 3.5-4/5 but the value for money solidifies a 4/5 rating for me.  It's a small place though so recommendations are a good idea or leave early to beat the lunch rush."}
{"text":"This isn't my first time eating at Oyshi, but my first time checking into Yelp. We don't come in everyday, but my family and I do come in often enough to know a couple of familiar server faces. Kevin is definitely an amazing server! No matter how busy he gets, he's always attentive and always has a great attitude! If you come to Oyshi on SAHARA, request for Kevin. HES THE MAN!! I'm more than 100000% sure you'll love him as much as my family and I do.   To top it all off, if you may know..the sushi buffet is the best! Super tasty and comes out quick! All seating is comfortable. Counter and tables! Love this place to death."}
{"text":"Now I don't know how many check-in's I have on Yelp, but I've been here a fair amount of times to know what is good and what is bad about this place. This was the first AYCE sushi place I've been to here in the valley and it's not in my top 3 places. To sum it up, Oyshi is so hit or miss that it's almost a risk to come here. Yes, you'll come here see that there's a long wait and expect it to be great but the last few times I've been here and given chance after chance, I've left disappointed.   First of all, I used to work in a restaurant. Server's know when it's busy, trust me, and as a customer I expect you to acknowledge that. The times that I've waited for a decent amount of time, I've never been apologized to about the wait or been given an explanation when the rolls I've ordered don't come out when it seems like people who just sat down are getting there's before me.   I'm not that selfish, but I just feel like the service here is poorly conducted. I've felt that it takes a group of us to look around constantly before someone comes and asks if we need anything. The rolls are always very good, but the amount of time that it takes most times I'm there is not average to the sushi places I've been to.   I will admit I do love their Salmon Nigiri and the Love Affair roll but a lot of the other rolls often feel like there is just too much going on. I don't like to complain, but the service isn't up to my standards and my standards aren't extremely high. I just expect my water to be refilled within a decent time and asked if I'd like to order more without having to ask to order more.   I am very forgiving and I will come here, I just don't have the expectations that I once did. The sushi is usually very fresh and the options aside from the sushi are great. I always order the calamari and the surf-n-turf appetizers when I come here. I would recommend this place to a friend, I think I would just advise them to be go-getters with their servers and make it known when they want something. All in all, if someone said they were coming here tomorrow, I'd probably join them. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Always a crowd pleaser . Excellent service and foods.  Always having the Rib Eye Teriyaki appetizer and the Double Salmon.  Everyone I bring here never complain,  in fact sometimes we might eat here twice in one day !"}
{"text":"This location has been under two different names . The quality of the sushi is not the same as the location on Rainbow . The service is OK . Improvements are needed if they want to carry the Oyshi's reputation. The only thing I liked was that they weren't packed like the Oyshi on Rainbow ."}
{"text":"Great fresh food! The wasabi was even super fresh ! The bento lunch special was a big portion and very tasty. I ordered the 3 hand tool special. A special note the yum yum scallops are actually a mix of mostly crab meat and a few scallops. So specify if you are looking for just scallops. Everything was delicious and the service was good too!"}
{"text":"Damn, where do I start... this place has one of the best AYCE sushi bar for a price under $30. I love Japanese food, so I'm quite critical when it comes to quality. The quality here is equal to the quality in Japan.  For starters, I'd begin with the Ahi Poke, Shrimp & Asparagus, Dynamite and Ribeye Steak Teriyaki.   When you're ready for battle, I'd suggest the Yellowtail Trio, Atomic Bomb, Red Dragon, and Bonzai Rolls!  To complete the food madness, grab some mochi green tea ice cream!  So who's down for a Vegas run?"}
{"text":"Food was great and everyone was nice. They took back a roll that we did not order without a problem. Definitely going to come back with more people."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Went 20mins before getting our drinks, half of the food we ordered NEVER came out! Most of the food served for one of my guests either tasted like freezer burned sashimi & tasteless ribeye! This is the 2nd Sushi place I've tried here in Vegas & lets just say that I am far from impressed.   Kudos to our waitress Toni for picking up the slack of her coworkers & handling what could be an irate situation with patience."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town!!!  Great prices too.  Waitstaff is very accommodating. My wife is vegetarian and the chefs make her special rolls. We have been to many all you can eat sushi restaurants and this place is by far the best!!"}
{"text":"I just want to say Oyshi is one of the best All-you-can-eat sushi places around Las Vegas. In fact, a year ago I would have given it a 5 star rating. The reason I only gave a 4 star is because the quality of service has dropped. Largely due to the fact that it has gotten so much busier. There are more waiters but they do not tend to the customers fast enough. The food is great, but for an all-you-can-eat spot, you will enjoy the large menu they offer. The food is always fresh because of the amount of traffic they had. You can find your favorite server and request them to serve you.. Usually requesting anyone to serve you in particular will encourage them to serve you better. I am sure everyone was expecting my 4 star rating to be all positive but I've gone to Oyshi since it opened and I understand the restaurant has grown from what it originally was. The service has dropped a little but they still offer you great food for a great price."}
{"text":"I love this place. The price is reasonable. Everyone pretty much summed it up. Their Oyshi rolls are the BOMB. I love their Surf and Turf too... Another thing that is awesome about this place is that they sometimes get the UFC fights and you get to eat all you can eat sushi for $26 and watch the fights for free... Like tomorrow night. Make sure you make reservations cause its pretty small and seats get filled fast!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have always loved it. This place is so clean you could eat off the floors. No but really. I would come here more often if it werent so far away from me. Love the surf and tuf."}
{"text":"Really good screaming O and I love the pumpkin croquette it's very good. I asked for fresh wasabi and they gave us a lot, which is nice because I use tons of it!"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi place in Las Vegas! Ej the server is great and always there for your needs AND I know they don't like to admit this, but I know they have one of the cooks on the aux or DJing cause he's cooking the restaurant up with bangers !!"}
{"text":"Has been a looong time since I went to Oyshi, as my first experience here was less than memorable, and pre-Yelp.    Some colleagues talked me into another visit recently, and I have to say, I was pleased with the AYCE lunch special.  I found a couple rolls that were interesting and spicy.  Enjoyed them both thoroughly.  My colleagues raved about their selections also.  The sushi chefs were very courteous, and the waitress was quick to assist with questions and recommendations.    I will definitely keep this on my lunch list, and may have to make an evening visit, when you really decide on that last star at a local sushi spot!  \"Kanpai!\""}
{"text":"So delicious !! Best place in Las vegas. I love \"all can you eat\" !! :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place like many locals in Las Vegas. Quality is always good. We orders All You Can eat. My favorite are sushi spicy tuna, shrimp tempura and the potato croquette. The location on Sahara is quieter than the other one. Personally, I like i better."}
{"text":"Love the Halloween spirit, food & excellent service by Game & Sabas.  Remarkable!  The sushi bar & whole restaurant was packed so I was surprised that they sat us so quickly on a Sunday night, 10.22.17, 6:30pm.  My first time, guess we got lucky!  We ordered many items & not one was left behind.    Sizzling Ribeye plate over cabbage, side of rice, miso soup & the salad had a tasty ginger dressing & was larger than a usual side dish.  Cooked perfectly & well seasoned  ribeye, sliced.  They offer Teriyaki Chicken, Surf & Turf, Asian Skirt Steak & Sweet & Spicy Pork also.  Salmon Lover Roll, Game's recommendation was fabulous!  Lite lemony mustard cream drizzle over tempura salmon, avocado, cream cheese rolled in rice & topped w/ fresh salmon!  Delish & I will start w/ it again!  I'm not a Spicy Tuna Roll fan, but we also ordered the Spicy Tuna Crunch which was fantastic.  Jalapeño, cream cheese deep fried & topped w/ spicy mayo & eel sauce so you can't go wrong.  Many rolls have cream cheese btw.  I usually look for the ones that are more fresh so next time will sit at the sushi bar & experiment.  I did love our servers recommendations tho!    Our Vegan friend got the Cucumber & Avocado roll which was also delish.  Overall, the menu is very appetizing w/ numerous items that I must come back for & I was happily surprised by everything at Oyshi.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"We were just there on Sunday night and was very pleased with everything.  This was our first time there and we sat at the bar and had a blast of a time.  The guys behind the counter making the sushi were attentive to our needs and made us laugh.  When we go back to Vegas, we will make sure to go back to Oyshi Sushi again and bring friends."}
{"text":"Busy day and it seems like they're short handed? Bad service. We were told only 20 mins wait and it become 1 hour wait. Worst service. Didn't even get a refill for our drinks. Can't do half order and you can only order one dessert. Sushi don't taste good. Calamari was hard and cold. Employee don't know what the heck are they doing. Manager should know better that valentines day is busy people are out to have dinner. You should've schedule extra people."}
{"text":"Hip and trendy. Probably the most attentive service I had in a long time!  The server constantly asked us if we needed anything and made sure our glasses were filled with water.  The place is clean, aesthetically pleasing.  They have an all you can eat deal for 20 bucks for lunch..but I decided to go with a la carte. I ordered the Chirashi bowl hoping to fill my craving of when I get the Korean version called Hweh do bap.  The rice had too much vinegar flavoring, the sashimi wasn't cut thin enough and didn't taste too fresh at that.  My search is still on for THE BEST SUSHI in town."}
{"text":"4.30.11 I definitely enjoyed the atmosphere, it was cute for a huge restaurant. It was dim, but not to the point where you can't see anything. I really like their sushi bar it's really big. The tables in the restaurants are nicely spaced so you're not rubbing elbows with your neighbors. I'm not used to Japanese Restaurants that can accommodate several large parties. They had two private rooms and we were in another area that was semi-private. There were 9 of us and we sat comfortably. I really like the painting they had against the wall in our semi private area. It was actually the only painting I saw throughout the restaurant.   I have never eaten at an AYCE sushi in Las Vegas away from the strip so I was super excited. I ordered their Agedashi tofu and it was so Salty! Stay away, ha ha. I was disappointed but quickly got over it when I tasted their poke salad. I remember ordering the Kimono Roll, Yellow Trio and dessert. I had more than that, but I was so amazed how refreshing everything tasted I was too excited to remember to write it down. When I ordered I stayed away from tempura or anything baked. I was not going to get full off that, I wanted fish. Their sushi was fresh and I especially remember the salmon handroll, it was perfect. I really enjoyed their food, although the oyster was okay and their uni really looked like it needed a makeover.   Their Service was super duper good, although for some reason I was the last one to receive my order. That made me the last one to eat the desserts everyone was done while I was still waiting. Ha ha. Do not pass up on ordering their Mochi Ice Cream. Doesn't matter if you're full and your fly is about to pop, still order their dessert.  So overall, next time I will definitely come here for their AYCE! Their selection of rolls for their AYCE is plenty, not like other places its mainly filled with baked and tempura stuff. This one had plenty of raw fish in their rolls. Just the way I like it!   Don't be a fool and miss out on this wonderful meal.."}
{"text":"We are big on sushi and still been looking around for the best AYCE sushi places in vegas. Been seeing Oyshi but finally decided to try it out for lunch.   Sorry to say, for the first experience, i'm probably not gonna be coming back.   Service is very slow. Our first order of Ikura, Saba and spicy tuna took nearly 20 minutes to make. non of which is cooked and the restaurant was not very busy.   When we finally got our sushi, the rice was mushy. pieces were very small.   It took a while before we could put in our next order which again took a while to get to us.   Apparently we weren't the only ones not satisfied with the service. had 2 other tables that were commenting the same thing.   On to the next sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"CHEF ED! ahhhhhh thank you for the absolutely amazing hand roll sushi  to die for ! Always good service at the sushi bar !"}
{"text":"1 star?  Why?  2 Words - FOOD POISONING on the night of 11/05/2011  Totally ruined my last date night with my wife before I deploy for the military when you are praying to the porcelain gods hurling with nori blowing out of your nose...graphic I know...   To top it off, the rolls were mediocre compared to Sushi Twister and Sushi Xtreme and the service was slow for the amount of people in the restaurant.    What are my credentials to be badmouthing this \"highly\" rated yelp institution?  5 years living on Honolulu and knowing what sushi restaurants are supposed to taste like, but what do I know...uggh worst night ever afterwards SMH"}
{"text":"Great quality with great price.  Their dishes are more fusion Japanese than traditional, but I enjoyed it.  Sashimi grades are excellent"}
{"text":"Average sushi at best but considering that for $27 you can get all you can eat lunch, I'm a fan.  Pros: 1. decent selection of rolls, sashimi, appetizers for the buffet option 2. friendly service  Cons: 1. No sweet shrimp or uni (sea urchin) for lunch buffet (dinner only) 2. Dynamite roll had wayyyy too much mayo which was gross 3. No all you can eat dessert!? Wanted some more of that strawberry mochi!  Recommendations: I'd choose the skirt steak over the other steaks. Yellow halibut is awesome (don't get the baby halibut as it is bland). Any of their rolls is decent but nothing really stood out to me in particular.  Definitely worth coming back for the lunch special"}
{"text":"Best sushi buffet! So good! We definitely ate our money's worth of food! The service was super slow, which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. They have a huge parking lot right outside. there was no wait when we went in for dinner on Thursday night. Too bad this place isn't on the strip, or it'll be packed! Should definitely drive out from the strip to try this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent service (Anthony & Curtis) & great food. Loved it. $21.00 FROM 4-5:30, happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! The sushi I fresh and they serve it to fast. 2 for 1 beer?.. doesn't get Any better!..staff is incredibly friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"Great sushi, big selection, with reasonably priced lunch combos. The restaurant is very small but has a quaint, intimate atmosphere with traditional Japanese decor.   The maki rolls are consistently yummy, not too ricey with a decent amount of fish in them. The sashimi is also great, if you like butterfish I'd highly recommend the butterfish sashimi, very creamy tasting.   A must try for salmon lovers is the Salmon Dom (Salmon sashimi pieces over rice with avacado slices). The Salmon Dom offers a large portion of fresh delicious salmon sashimi with yummy creamy avacado at the best price point I have seen from Salmon Dom ($13.99) usually I have seen this dish priced at $15.99-$18.99 at other comparable sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"Love the food and service! Great spot for AYCE. Been going to this location for years and has always been great! Only complaint would be the hours. They say they're open until 2 am, but I have gone multiple times around 12 and they've been closing super early!   I work in the restaurant industry and get it that on slower nights you might close early. But when there's a line out the door of people you are turning away, doesn't seem smart for business or for customer satisfaction. I would NEVER go to a restaurant 5 minutes or even an hour before close, but closing 2 hours early? Really??   Food is great tho. Just go in 4+ hours before close to ensure you can be seated."}
{"text":"More than half of the time I visit Vegas, I spend the whole time off of the strip. Lately, I've really been trying to find local \"Off strip\" eateries and establishments. The last few times I've been to town, I've gone to Oyshi Sushi. It's conveniently close to my folks' house. Oyshi has two different set-ups. One is AYCE (All you can eat) and the other is A la carte. I've done both. The service and staff are good, the place is clean, and the prices are average. The sushi is good but not spectacular and the portions aren't as meaty as I'd prefer. Now, this isn't a reason for me not to eat at Oyshi, but yeah, it's nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Initially, I found it very odd that every review on this place was 5 stars but after eating here, I couldn't agree more! We came on a Sunday for a surprise lunch for my mom for Mother's Day (I made sure it wasn't ON the actual day so she'll be genuinely surprised. Hehe) Let me start off by saying that I've never been to the other Oyshi location so I'm not here to compare or anything like that.  So, the interior is just GORGEOUS! High ceilings, beautiful decor, bold, gorgeous color. The tables, benches and chairs are comfortable and spacious. Our hostess greeted us with a smile and our server Kyle, was just as delightful. He was so sweet and nice and accommodated us very well. Always checked up on us, with a smile every time.   Now on to the food. Divine! I've had a lot of sushi and Japanese food, in general and this place is one of the best I've ever been to. Food quality is amazing. The fish was so fresh and sushi never broke apart (Sadly, I've been to a lot that does & it's not pleasant). Hot foods came to us really hot so we knew they were freshly cooked. I loved it!  Oh & the best part would have to be the price. AYCE lunch was $21.95. For the classiest, yummiest, Japanese food, that is inexpensive! Sushi items seemed endless so you'll have a variety on top of the kitchen items. And please, please, please, try the Green Tea Creme Brulee & Green Tiramisu. Eating them was.. love at first bite!"}
{"text":"for all you can eat, you can't beat this place... service is great and the ambiance is pretty trendy, especially if they play trance during your dinner... can't beat that..."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great service! Reasonably priced! Our second time here and highly recommend! Told were really wonderful! One if the best sushi places in town!"}
{"text":"The AYCE here is LOVE. So many options but the quality is there; apps are so yummy. Always a fun time here. Thanks for serving Sharon, we'll be back to see ya."}
{"text":"This is one of the best AYCE sushi joints out there. Their fish is fresh and the portions are right. The sushi is big enough for you to actually taste it, but at a size where you don't get full quickly. My staples at any AYCE sushi joints are eel and avocado handrolls and nigiri. I'm not a big fan of rolls and this place does it for me. They also have additional appetizers that you won't find at typical sushi restaurants. I really like their seaweed salad, which is quite the generous portion. Seaweed salad is expensive and this place does not skimp out. The albacore is especially good at this restaurant. They have these sizzling plates which comes out on fajita wooden plates. I have tried the surf and turf which is really delicious. I would recommend getting one to share with a few friends. The appetizer portions are small, but they do fill you up. Try sharing the appetizers so you can save room for the real stuff. With this said, the best part truly is the dessert. This place by far has the best tasting Creme Brulee I have ever had. The only bad thing is that dessert is not all you can eat, it's only one per person. Make sure you leave room for dessert because you do not want to miss out. I have been here twice and will definitely come back the next time I'm in town. The service has been great during both of my visits. The food is usually out at the right time and you never have to wait too long for your orders. The waiters are also really sweet. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"whenever im in vegas i always go out of my way from my mainstay on the strip to go here because its worth the side trip.  prior to XS, i brought my group of 8 here and it definitely started the night off correctly...the staff was friendly and seated us in the private room which provided a more intimate atmosphere given out attire.  in the main room, there is the usual sushi bar and a few flat screens to get a lil more rowdy. in essence, it caters to all types of occasions which i liked.  as far as the food goes- amazing. nuff' said"}
{"text":"Awesome all-you-can-eat sushi buffet that includes dessert and hot plates. Can get busy at times but we'll worth the quality sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"Gonna base this review with overall experience. Honesty I didn't enjoy myself besides the company I was with. The service there is horrible... Horrible!! I would've possibly given this review a 3 based on the fresh sushi.. Wasn't so bad.. But it slightly tastes fresh even if sitting at the bar not having been served ASAP to the customer.. So sushi pretty delish.   But honestly the service there is beyond poopy because.. Sure went on a Sunday, did not wait for a seat but I did wait just to order a glass of water just about 15 minutes.. Just to order that damn water.. And behind me was a wife and kid and the server finally asked are you waiting for something? And she responded. \"yes my sushi, I've been waiting for 20 minutes\"  Yeah... Keep that in mind and enjoy!"}
{"text":"By far the best all-you-can-eat sushi places I have ever been to. My cousin, who lives in the area, claimed that this place has really good sushi and an even better all-you-can-eat deal. As I'm from San Francisco, I was a bit cautious and not too optimistic about the quality and freshness of the fish, however I was quickly impressed with the large variety of rolls, fish as well as other main entrées and appetizers on the menu. I started with the simple seaweed salad and edamame, both which were well seasoned and served at the perfect temperature. Typically I am a fancy, combo roll fan but I will have to say that the quality of fish made the simple rolls one of my favorites of the night. The spicy yellowtail roll was very good as was the salmon avocado. To finish off, the all-you-can-eat menu there is a choice of dessert. I'm always a fan of the green tea ice cream and in this instant the ice cream was superb.  Will def go back the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Friendly but WORST SERVICE Ever!!!!!  We had to ask for our server 3 times, we only ordered twice ayce cause they were so slow.  Food is not as good as the oyshi on Rainbow.  We will never come back!!!!  Very poorly managed, not enough servers and over staffed in other positions.  On top of that manager walked by several times and saw are drinks were empty and did nothing about it.  Best part was the trio creme brûlée which there is no trio only one reg creme brûlée.  Sushi rice was very mushy."}
{"text":"Very bad service !!! Food was good but u wait a long time for ur food.... The only thing the servers can do so quick is when they give you ur check....not very nice is like there doing it in purpose....i dnt ussually do this review but we were there 3x & still same ....."}
{"text":"This place was actually really great. I have not heard of it and came here on a whim thanks to Yelp. I was pleasantly surprised by what I found. This place is a nice size restaurant with a large sushi bar-, which is a super plus. The wait staff was nice and the sushi chefs were super friendly. They were super helpful as well (not to mention one that was super cute lol.) I ordered two rolls, both spicy. One had a spicy chili such and was deep friend. The other had Cajun albacore on the top - SO AMAZING. I would go there and order everything with that on top of it. The flavor was nice with a subtle kick in the back. I also had the crème brulee trio- also called the trilogy (by the cite sushi chef) The green tea wasn't good at all- way too strong but the other two, vanilla and chocolate were excellent. The chocolate was absolutely fantastic and I'm not a huge fan of chocolate crème brulee. Also the fact that they're all you can eat was only 26.95 is a super plus. They have a variety of specialty salads and appetizers you can ad onto that that looked amazing. Unfortunately I didn't have enough room for that but Ill be back! Probably next week with a friend."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite sushi chain here in Las Vegas! They have an All You Can Eat (AYCE) menu with many to choose from! Personal favorites: Love Affair, Vegas Roll, and Ribeye steak! For dessert I usually get vanilla creme brûlée or mochi ice cream!"}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing and the service to match! This is the best sushi in Las Vegas! The food, service, and ambiance are phenomenal! Thank you Oyshi for a wonderful dinner and experience, I would recommend this place to anybody looking for amazing sushi and not looking to break the bank!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Sushi spot. Delicious through and through and fast service. The All You Can Eat is a fantastic deal. The garlic albacore nigiri is off the charts!"}
{"text":"I was coming through vegas on my move across country, and great friend said he wanted to take me out for sushi.  This was a special occasion for several occasions:  we were meeting after knowing each other online for ten years, it was a few days before my birthday and most importantly, I'd never eaten sushi before. I told him to pick somewhere really special and where I could try several different things because I wasn't sure what I'd like.  He said that Oyshi was all you can eat, which meant I could sample just about anything I wanted.  We ordered everything. This little guy put away about 18 pieces of yellowtail.  I tried it and it was ok, though the rolls were definitely the star.  The fried calimari was amazing.  We ordered fantasy roll, sexy roll, love affair, and dragon roll.  It was all amazing! if I had to pick my favorite, it was the love affair.  We also got seaweed salad, sweet shrimp, and fried scallops. The only thing I didn't care for was octopus, but it was a personal preference.  it was amazingly good, all of it, and they were so nice! Service was excellent and since 2 people in our party were almost an hour and a half late, they even let us stay longer than the two hours allowed.  It was the best first experience having sushi that I could've had!"}
{"text":"Oyshi has been my favorite all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant for a long time.  Great food, great service.  This visit was no exception.  Went after work in a group of 7 around 10 pm.  No problems!!  We ordered a LOT of food...different rolls, sushi, appetizers, all of which were delivered quickly to our table.  Our server, Thomas, was great.  He and his staff kept our drinks filled and our table cleared of empty plates.  I've tried other places for AYCE sushi....and they've been good as well.  Oyshi always hits the mark, though, and they are open late allowing for late night dining.  Except on Sunday when they close a little earlier.  Me and my co-workers will definitely be returning!!!"}
{"text":"It was just OK. We went based upon raves from our friends who went for the AYCE deal. We are not AYCE fans but decided to try the ala-carte option.  It's a very large place and was bustling on a Saturday night. Lots of families. Very loud booming music (not for us) When we go out we look for a relaxing experience - this isn't it.  We were greeted warmly by the hostess and our server. When we said we didn't want AYCE we were given an additional menu. So we had a large menu with the rolls and AYCE info and another with \"dinner\" options. They have lots of rolls with the \"dynamite\" mix which seems to be Krab mixed with other seafood and mayo.  The sushi is a B-. Certainly the quality isn't up to our other favs like Sen and Soho but not bad. They have a lot of rolls and cooked menu options. I had the \"steak\" on rice. In parens because it seemed more like chopped beef. It didn't resemble a quality steak but for $12 who could expect otherwise. The sauce was high in sugar and salt. Very tasty but we were thirsty all night.  The tempura was very greasy. Not a redo.  Service was great!  Prices are very reasonable and you get a lot with the dinner orders. If you like a lot of ok food at cheap prices this is definitely the place for you."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here to celebrate their 20th birthdays. It's hard to find a sushi place with a lot of room. Our party consisted of 30 people. Our server Ondree was AWESOME! Mind you gave a lot of suggestions to my friends who haven't been there before. He had a great personality and a ton of patience. He ended up printing us all separate checks without us even asking. Can't wait to go back again! Enjoyed dinner a ton, great company and great service!!! :) Thanks again Ondree!"}
{"text":"Went with a large party this past week, more than half of us became VERY ill with food poisoning Beware!!!!!!  Never again !!!!"}
{"text":"After years of going to crowded sushi bars with minimal arm room between me and others, I found a location with comfort as well as a great selection of sushi creations. The restaurant is an upscale environment with room for large parties.    - The restaurant offers a huge menu of both sushi and hot kitchen items (e.g., sushi, koma, Hamachi, sizzling hot plates of steak and seafood, tempura, oysters, soups/salads, and desserts).   -  There is usually a wait to be seated. The wait is sometimes as long as an hour during peek dinner times. You can drop in to be put on the list, and they will text you when they are ready to seat you. They take reservations.   - They offer an all you can eat sushi menu for about $25 that includes one desert (e.g., green tea ice cream, creme brûlée, Moche ice cream).  - My favorites are the yellowtail koma, double salmon roll, surf and turf sizzling hot plate, spicy tuna hand roll, fresh sashimi red snapper and halibut, Red Rock sushi roll, and the vanilla creme brûlée with green tea ice-cream.   I've been to this location over a dozen times in just the last four months - my most frequent visit being last week for lunch. I generally ask for my favorite sushi chef and server, and I am willing to wait for them. Vincent is the best server!  This restaurant generally wants the server to tell the sushi chef your order even as you sit at the bar. At first I wasn't fond of this process, but it works well and there isn't a lag in service. The sushi chef still hands you your order -it just prevents you from yelling out at a busy chef. Vincent offers exceptional service that includes getting your beverages, kitchen items, and sushi bar order. He is exceptional.   The sushi chefs are all awesome, but my favorite is Ivan. When the restaurant isn't too busy, he will inquiry if you want anything. If you request, he will also make creations for you based on what he notices you like. He is efficient, creative, and humorous."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh sushi, an all you can eat menu, and great customer service!  I rotate between the rainbow location and this one depending on who is working.  Father's Day was a busy night. Still, the restaurant reserved my seating for three in front of Chef Daniel at the Sushi Bar.   The all-you-can-eat menu is pages long and includes sizzling hot plates (e.g., surf & turf), cold salads, hot soups, tempera, sushi combinations, and one selection from their dessert section for about $25.00. Although the Hamachi Kama isn't included in the all-you-can-eat price, I usually order it. It is on of my favorites.  The atmosphere is relatively quiet and roomy. The lighting is dime in the evening. This restaurant offers a more private atmosphere with room for large parties as well. They have a full service bar. They have TV's at the bar and the sushi bar.   The restaurant often has daily sushi fresh catches that are available for the all-you-can-eat patrons. I love when they have the red snapper and fresh conch.   You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Been going here since they opened. Best all you can eat sushi in Vegas.  Prepared to order and too many favorites to list. If you want to explore a large variety of tasty items this is the spot. I make it a point to visit at least once a month and never disappointed."}
{"text":"Always love coming here... They always go light on the rice, a quality you can't find in too many all you can eat spots. Some of the rolls are a little saucy for me but once you have it once just ask for easy sauce next time. Great service, good food... What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! One of my favorite for appearance, food, friendliness and manners in all of the Las Vegas Valley. The All You Can Eat is outstanding; I highly recommend Tako, Sake and Ebie Raw Sushi and Shrimp and Veggie Tempura. Follow by Berry Vanilla Ice Cream Parfait. This is always wonderful and I am happy when I can eat here often!!"}
{"text":"I really wish that we had an Oyshi near my house. Their all you can eat sushi is the best. Make sure you also ask for stuff that's not on the menu, such as white tuna.  Conclusion: high quality food that makes you satisfied"}
{"text":"AYCE sushi!! Apparently there quite a few of these places in Las Vegas, but Oyshi cannot be beat!   My cousins ordered for us since my BF and I were first timers. Some of the rolls they ordered included the Sunset, Spider, Philadelphia. And of course - lots of nigiri! The ahi belly and salmon nigiri were my faves.   Finally, dessert! we had the green tea creme brûlée, the vanilla creme brûlée and the green tea tiramisu. All were winners!!  Lunch for us was $22 per person. We went around 1pm on a weekday, which was great because it wasn't that busy. Be warned that the appetizers are not included in the AYCE, so be sure to ask your server what's included. Our server was helpful and gave us suggestions for various rolls and nigiri. However she got busy and would disappear for long periods of time... oh and the hot water machine was broken, so no miso soup or hot green tea :(  Cheers to AYCE sushi!! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love it! Big menu and fresh sushi!!! Staff is always pleasant. It can get busy on the weekends but they have call ahead seating!"}
{"text":"Was sick and was craving for hot soup and noodles. The only place open past 10pm around the Harbourfront area was Oysi Sushi  I ordered the Tempura Udon which came out to $12.95.   First the typical Japanese salad came out with a huge side order of Edamame which was a pleasant surprise.  For the main entree, the udon was chewy and the broth was tasty. It came with tempura crispies, artificial crab, slices of fish cake and some veggies. About two minutes later, a basket of tempura came out. There was around 8 pieces which is plenty for one person. I was completely satisfied with the portion size, price and service. Will be back here again, but to try their sushi plates."}
{"text":"Great food! So fresh. The table management is god awful. People stacked on top on each other in the lobby with open tables and at least 6 seats at the sushi bar. We literally watched money walk out of the door as customers got frustrated with waiting. Lots of choices for food in our area and more restaurants opening every month. Get it together please!"}
{"text":"5 MF stars  ALL YOU CAN EAT for $22 my dude  Great music  Friendly staff  I cannot stress how freaking delicious this place is. My radio co-host from Cake And Sausage brought me here because she knows my heart.  We EASILY ate OVER $100 in sushi, surf n turf, tempura and poke for $22 my guy. Twenty two dollars total!!! It included dessert   Lobster rolls, BSCR iCant. Just come here"}
{"text":"Food was good and fresh! but not really happy for the service... It's all you can eat, sometimes missing some orders and the food come out quite slow!"}
{"text":"The AYCE sushi is great! The sushi rolls taste amazing, my personal favorite is the Nuclear Bomb and the Love Affair! Small appetizers and spicy sushi bowls are included as well as a specialty dessert. Get the green tea tiramisu, you can make all the other stuff in your kitchen and it tastes amazing.   Although the food is great, service is baddd. I'm pretty sure our server forgot the entire entree for my friend, as his food didn't come out until we were very much done with ours, and the rolls were not very difficult to make. Some servers took their sweet time just walking around the place with an FML look on their face. Overall, the food was great which keeps me coming back, but I definitely have to tolerate the service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. we will never go to another all you can eat sushi restaurant .we've been there over 20 times always had consistency with the food experience . The fish is always fresh, Green mussel are amazing.The all you can eat menu is very large... Yummy yummy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite AYCE!  Service is good, nice environment, and good food!  Just be patient if you're going with a big group.  ;)"}
{"text":"I'm very surprised at the high ratings of this place. I went there today while on a business trip to Toronto and didn't feel like driving so I decided to try this place out that seemed to have a SOLID 4.5 stars.  I ordered hot sake which was the best thing I had.  Then they bring me edamame as a free treat this stuff was dry as if it was sitting out for hours, I'm not making this stuff up folks.  I ordered Squid, Yellow tail, a volcano roll (I think that's what it was called) and my favorite of all Uni (Sea Urchin) All of it was terrible, very dry like it had been sitting around for a while and not very flavorful. Well I always save the best for last; I put the Uni in my mouth and started eating it and I got this nasty bitter taste. Unfortunately I had already swallowed sum before spitting it out. I really hope I don't get sick.  I tried to like this place; there is nothing better then that great feeling you get from your fellow Yelpers liking something and you enjoying it to. But I have to say I really hated this place. I have been so some really mediocre sushi bars but this one was not even something I would go to if it was the only sushi restaurant in the world.  YUCK! YUCK! YUCK!"}
{"text":"Good clean fresh fish lots of specialized Rolls that are very good. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is there tables setup and timeliness. Been going here for years definitely needs a remodel or revamp on the setting."}
{"text":"The food was great. Too bad the service was horrible. We sat waiting at the sushi bar for 20 minutes before our waitress even came to check in, we'd been done eating and just wanted the check. We even asked the sushi chef when he asked if we were doing ok. He didn't do anything about it. Bummer. We won't be rushing back here, Sumos has great food and great service."}
{"text":"Update: I visited the Rainbow location last night at 12:50am with some friends. (They close at 2am) We were told they were closing early because they were slow and they took last call at 12:45am. I questioned the guy and mentioned that their hours say 2am. My friends drove 45 minutes specifically to go to Oyshi! He said they decided to close early and we couldn't eat. I even mentioned that we knew exactly what we wanted, since their \"last call\" was 5 minutes earlier. He was not very friendly!   During the time we were standing outside deciding where to go, more people came and got very upset. That's at least 9 people they turned away! If your hours are until 2am, you should be open until 2am. From what I saw, they lost enough business to make it worth being open until the normal time. Next time we are going to eat, Oyshi will not even be an option unless it's early in the evening. When businesses aren't reliable, you're not gonna go out of your way to visit! Or tell others to visit at all! My review went from 5 stars down to 2. This isn't the first issue I've had at this location! Customer service is everything.   As far as the food...  My friend told me about this place and their All You Can Eat sushi but I wasn't too sure about going because I only like one kind of roll. When we decided to go, I asked her if they had a regular menu because I wouldn't be able to eat that much sushi to justify All You Can Eat. When we arrived I was shocked that their all you can eat menu included appetizers, sushi, and dessert! This was perfect!  My friend and I both ordered the Love Affair roll which is shrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster, crunch flakes and masago on top. (no eel sauce for me) It was delicious!!! We also ordered....  Gyoza- nothing special but yummy!  Surf & Turf Platter- all the platters are small, so you can easily order two. The steak is pretty good and the shrimp was amazing. (I am very picky when it comes to shrimp)  Ebi- the best I've ever had.   Teriyaki chicken- yummy  I absolutely love this place! I love variety without spending a fortune AND they are open late. (Well they are when they DECIDE to stay open)   Price:  $22 for lunch $27 for dinner"}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other night and it was good ! The sushi came out super fast and was delicious. Took a little longer on the apps but overall good experience ! Biggest concern was the cleanliness ! Lots of dust in the ceiling area and food on the floor ! The ceilings are black and you could see layers of dust plus the curtain at the front is super dirty and looks horrible ! I would recommend cleaning and looking at brightening the place up a little,  especially because they are busy !!"}
{"text":"Last few times I've went to oyshi the experience has gotten worse with each visit. Randomly I came here to read the reviews and I noticed something interesting, the favorable reviews were rarely from people in Las Vegas. Come to your own conclusion but this bugs me.  Oyshi, ditch the millenial staff, organize your kitchen and turn the stripper music off. Start acting like you used to when you were good."}
{"text":"After many attempts at eating sushi, I have accepted the fact I will never like it. Ever. BUT my friends still like it and I can't say no to food. I usually go for a chicken dish of some sort and was thrilled when I saw Oyshi has chicken teriyaki. My entree came with soup & salad. The salad was enormous and SO good - probably the best ginger dressing I have ever had. The chicken teriyaki came out on a skillet and a bowl of rice. It seemed to be more darker meat. The teriyaki sauce was sweet & good. My only complaint was the abundance of onions... I love onions but it was too much for me. The onion scent stayed with me the rest of the day! The amount of food I got for ~$9 was mind blowing. Would recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this sushi place. It's not always the cleanest and it could use a professional touch to improve the atmosphere but the food is remarkable. Since I moved I had to find a new sushi place and I like this one more than my last favorite place.  You must try the mango wasabi!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Clean inside. Went in for AYCE sushi it was very disappointing. The rice tasted at least two days old. The fish itself was somewhat ok. Complete waste of my time and money. Will never return..."}
{"text":"On our search for another epic place for sushi happens to fall onto this place as it drew us in for AYCE. I think a few of our friends had heard or were recommended to try this joint since they knew our group and how we can grub. The last place we went to before left a bad taste in my mouth and another a little ill from the meal, we were happy to try a completely different place.   The atmosphere, ambience, are very inviting yet dark for those intimate encounters due to the dark wood finish everywhere. TVs around for those ackward silent moments if you're on a date or deep conversation in a larger group. I do like the mural on the back wall which was really impressive.  Now, down to the food, you can order anything on the menu but just watch for any restrictions such as only 1 order of uni for example. I do like the sound of appetizers you can order such as rib-eye steak which is really less than tapas on a sizzling plate and a bed of cabbage and onions. Another beef plate was the same which tasted good but I feel like I would have to order 5 of these to really make a good size order to be called an appetizer.   The rolls are inventive and decorative which is a refreshing change from the other sushi places. My recommendation is to stick to the \"designer\" rolls rather than the sushi. I must strongly advise against ordering the uni which it could be me and an off night. I always try to be brave and order it knowing it could be really good or it could be really really bad. In fact, I didn't eat the second piece because the first one I ate tasted like iodine for some reason. Definitely may explain for my stomach pains on the way back to our place. Nausea may be another descriptive word for this feeling as well. The rolls taste great and presentation looks great but I may have to say no to sushi so far away from the coastline especially in the middle of the dessert. If you have reviewed or about to review this place and give it 5 stars, you may have to check yourself as your taste buds are a bit off for what great sushi really should be in quality."}
{"text":"I often used to come to Oyshi because it's close to my house and it was very delicious. Fish was always fresh and service was always good, but ever since they got popular, everything has down-graded.   I tried to give them second chances because I used to love this place so much! But lately, their customer service has been way too slow. I get that they're busy, which IMO they need to hire more staffs. My last visit, it took them at least 10 mins to realize that we were standing there waiting to be seated. Then, it took 30 mins for the server to bring us water and miso soup. The owner walks by and doesn't acknowledge us at all. You've got to be fast and efficient, especially a busy place like this, you've got to have more staffs. I will never come back again, even if it's a block away from my house.   Despite my horrible experience, I still love their Love Affair roll, it's the only roll that doesn't fail to satisfy me."}
{"text":"This is my favorite all your can eat sushi place in Vegas! You can always find a seat right off the bat (Which is a far cry from somewhere else Yama Sushi where I have waited up to 2 hours with a group of 6). The menu is much longer, and more unique than somewhere like Sushi Mon. The decor is pretty hip, staff very friendly. We go back at least once a month!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service. Judy was so helpful with recommendations. Very friendly staff. Timely turn around on the r"}
{"text":"Horrible service extremely long wait for our food all the drinks sat on the table empty with a nuclear roll burning through the skin in my mouth I'll never be back be sure to take my business down the street to Kobe or ohjah."}
{"text":"Ever since I can remember, Sushi-Mon (the one on silverado ranch/maryland pkwy) has been my favorite go-to spot. Words couldn't describe how good it is. But I decided to try something new. This place had 270 reviews with an average of four stars. So they must be doing something right.  After one minute of walking the wrong way..we finally got into the entrance..by Following THE ARROWS...  Decor was really nice, bigger than the usual sushi bars. Great Location too. The VIP room and Lounge room was a nice touch. It was slow mind you, during lunch when I walked in with my \"friend\" Karlee. We started off with, my favorite Ahi Poke and Miso Soup. Karlee had the soup as well and Gyoza. Ahi Poke was ok, but not better than sushi mon, the flavor wasn't just there. Miso was good, not fantastic. Karlee loved the Gyoza, she said it was better than the other Sushi place she goes that serves it.   I had the J&b roll, baked, with salmon and cream cheese. It was good, juicy, hand a hint of soy sauce. hats off to the sushi chef because it was awesome. I had a cucumber roll, asian strip steak and this deep fried california roll, with hot mustard and albacore tuna. All was great but the J&b roll was the highlight. karlee had 2 orders of the shrimp tempura roll, apparently it was good, I couldn't have any because I am allergic to shrimp. She tried to Force Feed it to me, knowing I was allergic, I think she tried to kill me, because I tried to make fun of her Sirarcha/Hot mayo sauce that she custom made..oh and She had chicken teriyaki and I think another order of Gyoza, apparently she loves that stuff.   The service was a little slow, especially when they weren't busy. This was all you can eat, and what I was shocked about how they did not serve Half rolls!! I was like WTF? how could I possibly try more than 3 types. Other than that The waitress seemed puzzled and brought us the wrong dishes a couple of times. No big deal. The Food was great, service was so-so, and It is a place I would come back to again. I also ate too much, because I regret not getting desert (no one really gets more than one desert, but why would they limit you to JUST one, its all you can eat!!!), being that it was one of the reasons I came here for, Green Tea Tiramisu, I'm Coming back for you!"}
{"text":"We had so bad experience here today. As my friends and I  have lunch here, servers were not nice.. At the moment, there were no many parties of customers, that means it wasn't busy at all. At the sushi bar, there were about four sushi chefs, and there were about at least 3 servers. Yet, our orders were delayed unnecessarily, and didn't receive any customer service. They didn't come to check if foods are ok. We got foods long after we ordered, and some of foods we ordered wasn't even put in and made. But we rather got foods we didn't order, or ones we canceled. I told a server that that's what we canceled, and the foods  we ordered earlier didn't came out. We were not ok with all of them at all today. A chef just came out and asked if we are chinese or korean. And asked if we canceled orders of spicy tuna and some other order. I said we did, and he answered us to enjoy our meal, but his attitude and tone of voice seemed like he had something to complain. The head chef, looked at us and laughed at us while he's passing by our table. Obviously it wasn't smile he may normally treat to customers. We felt so uncomfortable that we asked if we can talk to manager about many things since we had not only bad customer service ,but also foods were so bad. A server said that manager is not here. We paid for our check, and left. But we were definitely not ok with all of them, so we got in the restaurant again and if we can get manager's contact. The chef, who came to our table and told if we canceled food, seemed worried with us, so asked if there were anything went wrong. We told him about things we wanted to complain. He looked like he's pretending to listen to us. Looking uncomfortable with what we said, he asked what he can compensate with(but obviously his attitude was to get out of the situation). He took out his wallet and said \"I will refund for the price you paid.\" No one of us wanted to get refund, but his unnecessary action wasn't appropriate with the situation. He could have apologized about his and employees' faults sincerely, but he just tried to solve situation with his money. If he really wanted to compensate for bad service and was going to give us money back, he should have asked cashier to give us money back instead of taking out his wallet. There were even more things to say about foods, but I will reserve my opinion about food since it can reflect my bad feelings from bad experience.   Oh, I forgot to tell you guys. In korean culture, it's common that older people treat younger people poorly. But chef Ed, who asked our age, He didn't have to ask and talk about our age in spite of our young looking-appearence. Was that really necessary to ask our age? His attitude definitely made it worse. The attitude you have shown was not professional at all."}
{"text":"I would of loved to give this 5 stars but after my second visit this week my waiter was a complete idiot. He didn't have basic knowledge of sushi or the menu items available. When i asked for plum wine ice cream he stated naming off the different types of sake they offer. My sushi order NEVER came out. After we had eaten all our appetizers and put in a second AYCE order... we realized something was up because everyone around us was eating. When we ask where our food was the server accused us of getting our food and said we didnt order those things and... it was just bogus to say the least. Was excited to have a good place near by, but will seriously reconsider coming here, especially with all the AYCE in the area."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in this location. The restaurant itself is large, beautiful and has nice decor. The menu is the same as the other location. Promptly greeted and seated upon arrival. Decent wait staff service. The guy behind their bar did their best to completely butcher irrashaimasen .  First thing I noticed is that I ordered the poke salad and the tuna that was in it was scrap tuna. Just the low quality end pieces that wouldn't look good if used as nigiri.  Then we got a roll we didn't order.  Then we were told that we couldn't order half rolls (the rainbow locations allows this) unless we were sitting at the bar... I'm still trying to figure out how this makes even a little bit of sense. We were told \" well you can order half rolls if you are sitting at the bar\". The bar was 2 feet to my right. The restaurant had 3 total tables occupied, it was dead... this didn't make any sense. We likely would of consumed twice as much had we been sitting at the bar.  Our waitress was a little forgetful. Didn't bring us drinks or even wasabi when asked.  All of our sushi would just fall apart. I even received ikura where my nori  WAS BACKWARDS. Will not be going to this location ever again.  2 stars instead of 1 because of the wait staff service and fresh fish- I ate there yesterday and am not sick at least."}
{"text":"Got a Chirashi opposed to AYCE and the fish was super fresh, the rice is delicious, and best of all, the servers were extremely friendly. I was sitting at the bar area and Chef Ed was very nice. He showed professionalism and love for his job. We talked and he was always smiling. Very great sushi chef. He made the experience 6/5 if anything."}
{"text":"The fish here is VERY high quality and for AYCE, $27 dinner is very fair. It was my date and I's first time coming here and we were seated at the sushi bar by the very inviting waitstaff. The menu is full of choices and my date and I did not know what to get so, our sushi chef Jon had some really great suggestions and gave them to us to try and they were all AMAZING!!! my favorite was the Love-Affair roll. Also Jon really made our first time eating here a wonderful experience.  He was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and provided excellent service!!! Someone give this guy a raise!! Overall, this place just because my newest favorite sushi place! Will DEFINITELY be coming here from now on."}
{"text":"Dude, seriously. All you can eat everything. Anything on the menu except sashimi is fair game.   If you go here and don't think it's the bomb, we can't be friends anymore.  My Dad, Uncle and I came here at the recommendation of my brother-in-law. It did not disappoint. We had to wait a while to get a seat at the bar. There's also rooms around the main dining area that look like they're available to reserve.   The decor is pretty Neo-Far East trendy. Between that and the music, it comes across as a pretty hip, young place. This is not the place to go if you're looking for a quiet, traditional Japanese style sushi experience."}
{"text":"Surf and Turf roll, Surf and Turf sizzling plate, gyoza, and 3 order of garlic tuna with Pico. I could eat here all day. And every other Friday I did. BEST.AYCE SUSHI. EVER. The customer service is always on their A game, the food is always quick to come out, and they are pretty chill when it comes to leaving a little bit left. Not a full/half a roll. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. I was told by a friend to try this place and it sounded like some great sushi. Wrong. Walked in and half the tables were reserved. But there was space along the sushi bar. Took them 15 minutes to seat us, then we had a horribly slow server. Took 20 minutes to order sushi, and the sushi wasn't anything amazing. I suggest trying somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ate here with a group of friends & were sat in one of the small rooms which was nice. Service was great. Food was good but honestly there was nothing that blew me away. All of the rolls that we had didn't seem to have a real oomph to make me really like one. Considering I live on the other side of town & there are sushi restaurants that are closer to me that I like better I probably won't be back to Oyshi. The food isn't bad here there just wasn't anything that would make me want to drive across town to dine there."}
{"text":"A little above the average sushi places in Vegas, if you want somewhere good to eat but don't wanna pay overpriced then I would recommend Oyshi"}
{"text":"I'm a customer there for years. Love their appetizers. They are bomb, my favorites are shrimp on skewers, scallop popcorn, and baked mussels but don't forget tiramisu at the end of your meal. Any way, the last time I went there the tiramisu kinda changed it doesn't testy like usual."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, this is the first time I visited this place after a coworker recommended this place. Friends and I got AYCE. Disappointed that we couldn't order half rolls, only full rolls. So we couldn't try a variety of sushi because we got full fast. It's ok, the sushi all seemed the same. The creme brûlée was good, most memorable part of the experience. The green tea tiramisu someone got was ok. Didn't like how you can only order one dessert but unlimited ice cream. Got too full to try the ice cream. Their rules are weak compared to sushi mon or Yama sushi. Would not come back. I didn't think it was worth it."}
{"text":"*UPDATE* Man this place has been on a downhill slide. All the servers that were amazing are gone. Pedro, the best sushi chef in town, is the only person I recognize. Tonight was the final straw though. Waited 20 minutes to reorder and that was on top of the 10 we waited for the first round. Decided to pay the bill and leave. The server asked if we were in a rush, I said no but I'm over waiting for 20 minutes to order. Then he brushed us off with a, oh that must of been all my fault. Uh, ya it was. You served the table next to us and we had a table with all empty plates and drinks. When the owners asked if everything was ok, we told them what happened. Their response? Next time will be better. Lol nah, I'll be at Sushi Koma from now on. Bye!   Love this spot. Everyone is super cool even if you want to hang out for a while. They play good music and it's not crazy loud or packed like the first spot. I like the steak bites and hot tamale roll. Try to Japanese garlic lasagna too. If you like a lil spiciness ask for spicy maniac sauce. I dip everything in it! Don't forget to ask for Kenny! Best server in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food was okay ...I was disappointed at the end when we received the checks she charged a 20 % tip for me and 20% for each of my girl friends it was only 3 of us ! I felt ripped off because we were not a large party! So why did the waitress charge individually that 20% tip !!! not going back !"}
{"text":"Cool local sushi joint, shows paper view for free.  Must try the all you can eat, well worth it."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! Food is awesome, I'd recommend sitting at the bar if the offer is available because this place gets pretty busy on a Saturday night.   The nice thing about the Sushi bar is the counter space is a lot wider than most sushi spots, this gives you a lot of space for all your AYCE plates ;)  My favorites, Yellowtail Trio and Love Affair roll. The Love Affair roll is full of so much flavor thanks to the mixture of the scallops and crab mix, the crispies add the texture that makes each bite easier to chew."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi at a reasonable price. Better than average sushi.   The servers kept brining me food I did not order though . It was pretty funny."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in southwest. Employees are always nice and food is always consistent which is important to me. Good music and def good drinks:)"}
{"text":"Ate today 1/10/16 at lunch with Chef Eth (sp?). AMAZING! My absolute favorite sushi spot. Clean, fresh fish and great service. Chef Eth went above and beyond and created sushi for me that was not on the menu, and everything came out beautifully, artistically, and delicious. Best sushi in Vegas. Thank you, Oyshi!!"}
{"text":"Thank you oyshi for ruining my Valentine's Day.  We arrived and we're told 30 mins.  Waited well over an hour.  15 mins after we were seated we were finally greeted. We ordered our food and waited. Over 30 mins.  This is now almost 2 hours after we walked in the door. Our food was brought to the wrong table. No waiter to check on us. No were sorry we will fix it.  The manager must have had his ears plugged. Because he didn't even attempt to fix our problem. Just basically said there's the door. I've been here 10-15 times. Will NEVER go back. This is the second bad experience in a row. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"We usually come here but today was wonderful. My husband and I sat at the bar with our 3 and 4 year old. They treated them as customers as well and made them tiny sushi rolls. It's was awesome!"}
{"text":"Would have given a 5 star but the service was a bit lacking. However, the food made up for it. Went to lunch there with our staff and the menu was wonderful. I ordered the lunch special sizzling plate with chicken teriyaki and it came with miso soup, salad, tempura shrimp and vegetables, and California roll with the entrée. It was a boat load of food for $10. I had to take a portion home. BTW: the green tea ice cream is also a screaming deal for two scoops $2.50. Great food but I should caution you to go early for lunch because you will wait for a good fair amount of time. I will definitely be back to give the service another chance."}
{"text":"Place is pretty delicious.  Food is tasty, only thing that leaves to be desired is the speed at which the food actually comes out.  Servers were awesome and very attentive.  All you can eat is quite the deal so it is much recommended.  Just prepare to wait some time for food to come out as the kitchen sure likes to take their time."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here for dinner. Everything was ok except for one thing, I order miso soup twice and I didnt get it. Even the chicken yakitori we didn't get it. We asked the server about it and she said she gonna check about it and still nothing happened."}
{"text":"I've been to this place well over 20 times and while sometimes the service is slow or sometimes there is a roll that isn't my favorite, it really is consistently great. I always do the all you can eat, and get a number of appetizers like seaweed salad and spicy sashimi salad, a couple hand rolls, and nigiri. I used to get a number of rolls, and find them great, but don't usually want that much rice and they're very filling.  Highly recommend this as a local sushi joint!"}
{"text":"Garlic edumame to start. Bonsai roll which includes spicy tuna roll wrapped with cajun albacore and avocado topped with garlic ponzu,  spicy tuna for my lil man and tempura udon for my mom. The Lil princess enjoyed teriyaki bento box. Love my waitress Iris, she is speedy, efficient and attentive to her customers. Thank you for a good experience."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was good, music was terrible. Just not what I enjoy listening to over dinner...sounds like a night club. I would also like to see more rolls that do not have cream cheese and also upside down shrimp."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for ayce sushi!!! Best place ever...  Picture says it all so you've got to try it out. Almost all special family occasion is an oyshi ayce night for us!"}
{"text":"Great food !!! Good service. Probably the best sushi in Vegas. I've tried quite a few spots too. Oyshi's wait list can be long but typically no longer than 30 min. I recommend making a reservation the morning of or day before. Try the sizzling skirt steak.... Yummmm"}
{"text":"I am so shocked that this place only has 3.5 stars! I am normally not a fan of \"all you can eat\" anything...but Oyshi is an exception.   AYCE sushi includes their ENTIRE menu- including sushi, sashimi, dessert, hot foods, and all rolls. The real kicker...it's only $28. I live in CA but each time we go out to Vegas we stop at Oyshi before hitting The Strip.  Quick tip: If you sit at the bar they permit you to order half rolls."}
{"text":"Not too bad. But not my first stop if I have a craving for Japanese. The rolls aren't that great. Or it could just be ones that we ordered. The service is great though. So that's a plus. Very polite and always askin if we needed anything. I would come bavk again but order something diferrent everytime until I find the right one."}
{"text":"So good!! Lunch specials are amazing! So much food for such a cheap price. Love it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had the chicken teriyaki with sushi lunch combo. The price was reasonable.  The chicken teriyaki was a pretty mediocre stir fry with peppers and such, quite oily. Didn't look or taste remotely like chicken teriyaki. They should have just called chicken-veggie stir fry.  The sushi was alright, but I didn't like the way the sashimi was cut. It still had a lot of fat and fish scales on it! Usually, if serving raw salmon with skin, the skin part should be torched or crisped somehow. What I had was raw fat and fish scales.  Maybe I got a dud, maybe the chef was in a bad mood that day, because the pictures of other yelpers looked alright. This place is not very consistent with quality."}
{"text":"SBC VEGAS SERIES:9 of many reviews I want some sushi NOW!!!!  Its hard to find sushi during lunch hours on the strip. Mind you that I didn't have any fancy jeezus phone or other interwebz navigating phone on me so I had to depend on my simple, yet reliable and dependable intuition... and lifelines. ;D  As I walked the strip during lunch hour sunshine I was rudely awakened to the fact after epic fail after epic fail that sushi apparently only open during dinner hours. FML!!!!   I end up calling my cousin to yelp it... bare in mind he doesn't know how to use the ever HOLY YELP but does what he can for me off his interwebz capable cell. He forwards me a list and after several returned calls of being open hours later one of them responds that they are currently open. I tell the cabbie who then proceeds to drive my ass half an hour into the desert. Who knew????  WTF??  Well, I get there to this strip mall in the middle of no where and proceed to order and drink, drink and eat, and eat and drink some more. I dock them one star for the uni.. it wasn't as good as I would have expected but then again we are in the desert and I suppose should be grateful for anything shell fish. After ordering countless orders of sashimi and sushi I realize that they offer a all-you-can-eat sushi.   Oh well!  It appears that a lot of people come here for this. I had no idea what to order so I flagged the closest waiter for assistance. The helpful and over zealous staff suggested a number of oddly named rolls which we humored them by ordering. Well, I can at least tell you that their menu offerings were pretty damned good. I wish I could remember the named of the lobster covered roll that I ordered because it was indulgent. So other than the uni I had no complaints about traveling the better part of an hour to get here.   now how do i get back to the strip? o_0"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite AYCE sushi place. They have really good rolls here. My favorites include Tiger roll and Lobster Fair roll. So delicious!  I would say...better than Kaya (Spring Mtn & Arville) worse than Goyemon (Hacienda and Decatur?)"}
{"text":"Very fresh sushi- came here with a girlfriend, and on a diet! She ordered AYCE for $21...her food looked amazing. I opted for a lot of low-calorie things, so I got fresh albacore (6 pc), house salad w/ dressing on the side, and miso soup.My food was amazing and I tried one of her lobster roll,that was also amazing! They had served us edamame as an appetizer beforehand I guess...awesome i love those little perks places like this offer. Sometimes its cucumber salad. Love. She ended up getting a pink ball of ice cream after,but I didn't try it. We will definitely be back, as they have a ladies night and AYCE for $21 quite often!"}
{"text":"We went there on last Saturday nite expecting full house, but the place was only 3/4 full.  We sat at the wide open bar for all-you-can-eat so it's easier to order sushi from the chef. Our first impression was good atmosphere and hip music.  We found the service excellent, contrary to some reviews. Maybe because it was not busy or from over staffing, we were asked \"How is everything?\" every 5 minutes, even thought we were sitting at the bar.  The food was just OK. We liked the ahi poke, spider hand roll, white tuna, and especially the green tiramisu. On the other hand, we were not excited about the miso soup, bland tasting sushi, water-down soy sauce, light wasabi, and $2.50 xtra for hot tea.  Over all, we thought $67 for two AYCE including 15% tip is just a little higher than most places in town especially for average food.  We might or might not go back."}
{"text":"I am so utterly disappointed we usually eat here all the time and we even made reservations to get to come and enjoy for Valentine's Day dinner and we figured everything would be great we even had little reserved signs! As soon as we sat down a gentleman took our drink order and first round of food since we decided to all you can eat, we started receiving our food from the bar but with no server in sight, with at least 10-12 servers/bussers walking around, about 20 minutes go by and my husband still hasn't gotten a refill and we still had a stack of used plates in front of us, finally I went up and talked to the host because we still haven't received refills or even taken any more orders, so we decided we just wanted the check even though we were still hungry  The host was extremely nice and I told her what had happened and she explained our first server was leaving and a lady was supposed to come help but she never did and she apologized and went and got the manager, she as well was very nice and asked if she could do anything but at this point we were so frustrated we just asked for the check and she kindly said no, and so we left... honestly this was one of my favorite places to go but after ruining our Valentine's Day like this we won't be back and that saddens me because of one person who neglected to even check on us or even introduce herself but then again we never even saw the first server again either or was told he was leaving so bad on the service area, but I do appreciate both the host and managers concern"}
{"text":"What to say about Oyshi? It is hands down my favorite sushi/all you can eat spot in town. The Sahara and Buffalo location is by far the best! We come here often and are loyal! Great choices from appetizers to rolls to desert!"}
{"text":"We randomly tried Oyshi on whim and I'm glad we did. The reviews are so harsh so I decided to write one. Our servers name was Jane, and she was great! The food is so good, you need to try the dynamite appetizer probably the best one in Vegas that I've found thus far from living here for about a little over a year. The atmosphere is great. They have private rooms for party's and they play some really good music. If I had to choose between sumo sushi 2 and Oyshi, for some AYCE sushi on this side of town, it would be Oyshi!! Lol anyway we will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"We love eating at Oishi - be sure to ask for Stefan for great service.  He listens to what you like & then makes awesome recommendations.  We eat here at least once a week"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town!! Andree was great, great service and friendly. AYCE deal super worth it! My girlfriend and I just love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten AYCE at Oyshi literally about 30 times. 29 out of 30 of those times the food and service was impeccable (the only minor issue  I had once was a new waiter that mixed up a few of my rolls). The waiter/waitress are fast and attentive, the place does no smell super fishy when you walk in (because the fish is fresh), the actual sushi tastes a notch above most in Vegas,it is super affordable, and they are open late. Everybody I know that has gone there loved it. Oyshi is a must try. It is across town from me now, but it is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Tiger roll. Snow mountain. Rattlesnake. Kamikazee. Nuclear bomb. Best rolls I've ever had & all are found here. The menu is huge. There are so many rolls to choose from. This place got me addicted to sushi."}
{"text":"I'm writhing in pain as I write this review because my stomach hurts so flipping bad after eating from here.  Prepare yourself for my meanest review yet.  First, NO.  Just no.  I want to shout this at the top of my lungs to the owner/manager/whatever of this place.  The sushi here was the WORST ever that Ive tasted.  They boast an impressive menu but too bad they do not know how to properly make each roll.  The fish was SLIMY and gross.  Sushi rolls should not slide down your throat, you should be able to chew them and relish in all the amazing flavors.  I couldn't distinguish any of the rolls apart and the WORST one was the Hawaiian roll.  It completely ruined my entire appetite and I couldnt eat any more sushi.  Like literally too disgusted.  Secondly, NO.  The service needed some help.  They were friendly but when they got busy they couldn't keep up.  There were 4 sushi chefs and 3 waitresses with the restaurant being full.  It took forever to get us seated (the hostess has to waitress just to keep up), forever to get our sushi rolls, and forever to get a refill and we went there when it was NOT busy.    Lastly, my boyfriend and I both immediately felt sick to our stomachs when we left.  Like nauseous, clutch your stomach, take tiny sips of water and moan sick.  So why one star?  Why bother to give one?  Because the staff WAS friendly whenever they did talk to us.    Also there were several flies in the restaurant.  DEE-SGUSTING  Harumph!"}
{"text":"Came back again and the service was outstanding, food came out quickly and fresh fish. Still havn' tried their full menu but the new stuff I did try was just as good as the previous time. Deffinetely my new favorite place where the service, food quality, and atmosphere makes it my favorite ayce in summerlin and possibly vegas."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Just came in for the all you can eat, and in one hour wet were served one tiny rainbow roll... The guy didn't take the time to come and check on us. People next to use were served right away after coming in 20 minutes after us. Should have known it was going to be bad when I asked if they were open and was ignored.  Will never come here again.  Next time will check yelp as I see the yelp reviews are similar to mine.   Just sad."}
{"text":"This place is always packed which makes for a good atmosphere. Sushi is edible but not the best in the area. You can find better all you can eat on the southwest side for the same price. They can accommodate large parties which is a huge plus."}
{"text":"went back recently and their service improved drsmatically.  they had mgrs/owners on duty over seeing the staff and coaching them on the spot.  my server was new but better than previous ones.  will go back soon for their awesome food."}
{"text":"Korean waiters are very friendly and fast. This is a yuce buffet. But, you can order food on a single menu."}
{"text":"We had a rental car so we decided to venture out of the strip and check this place out.   I'm sorry to write that Yelpers disappointed me this time.  AYCE sushi deal is a great value, no doubt.  However, if you like quality than quantity, then you will be disappointed too.  I get better sushi at mediocre places in east coast.   Yes, you would have to pay a bit more, however, I would rather  pay a bit more than be unhappy after spending almost $30 pp. I also wasn't keen on the house music being blasted like we are at some club.    I do have to say that the service was pretty decent.  I don't think I would ever return."}
{"text":"I was visiting for work and one of my colleagues lives in the area and suggested Oyshi. It was such a great experience.   ATMOSPHERE  Decor is modern and zen feel. There was a range in ages, families etc.   FOOD  It is all you can eat. I'm usually not a fan, always think that's it's pre made rolls etc. NOT HERE. It is made to order. The quality of the sushi was just fine. Again it's not Nobu, but it really is a good value and just tasty. I had mostly nigiri (sushi).  - albacore (regular, seared and Cajun) - yellowtail - peppered with yuzu sauce - roll forget the name, had tuna on the inside and albacore on top.  - dynamite appetizer  I enjoyed everything I ordered.   PARKING  Lots of free parking in the lot.   Anytime I'm in town now, I will make an effort to come have a meal here. Totally worth the drive from the strip."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best sushi spots in town! Really good rolls and not very expensive! I go here all the time!"}
{"text":"This place is probably one of my favorite sushi restaurants.  It has a spectacular AYCE menu with tons of appetizers and rolls to choose from.  My favorite appetizer is the surf and turf.  My favorite rolls consist of the Red Rock, Volcano, and Rainbow.  You can order half portions here, so that way you can choose to sample several rolls, or just stick to a couple full rolls.  There is almost always a wait, but it's well worth it.  The staff is super friendly and I have never dealt with poor customer service any of the times I have dined there.  The couple times I have sat at the bar have been great experiences too - the chefs are all nice.  It's in a great location, but I have driven past it a couple times without realizing it. Really, I have nothing but positive things to say!"}
{"text":"It's a great all you can eat spot with a large dining area. The servers are nice & the food is great. I enjoy getting all you can eat because I always try new things.  I highly recommend the super white & they also have green tea creme brûlée for dessert! It's amazing.  If you're into all you can eat, this place won't disappoint. It's a regular spot for me & I keep going back for more."}
{"text":"AYCE sushi is always better with a group!  Ordering a bunch of different things and sharing them all is the best way to go with AYCE sushi because you discover what you love and what you don't want to go back for. This is the second location in town and it's a very nice spot. The layout, decor and fun seating arrangements are the best part of this place. The food is ok, good but not fantastic.  Vegas has so many incredible sushi spots so having as many options as we do oyshi should offer half rolls and a few sashimi options. Most sushi places do and the ultimate giveaway is the rice to fish ratio. This place is big on rice. They also didn't carry super white. WTF?   So we came in a big group and ate our hearts out but I didn't have any unbelievable moments. Some things were better then the others and my favorites from this place were the iris roll, unagi and Spanish mackerel. But again nothing was a wow. Lots of rice and a 1 hour limit.   The company was great so overall we had fun but with so many sushi options this isn't at the top of my list."}
{"text":"It is a rather small place. But the food is good, closer to the authentic sushi in Japan than most of the Japanese restaurants in North America."}
{"text":"The all you can eat sushi menu is pretty extensive. At $26 for dinner it is right on par with other sushi places I have been to. The sushi is fresh, the steaks and meats are tender and juicy, and the appetizers like the gyoza and seaweed salad are tasty. The calamari could use some work in the flavor department however. The service there is second to none. You are greeted when you walk in by nearly all of the staff, the waiters/waitresses are friendly and attentive, and the bus staff makes sure your table isn't cluttered with plates and your drinks are never empty. The wait for the sushi can get a little long, so order up some appetizers and sides while you're waiting. Just remember that there are other tables waiting for sushi, and only a few sushi chefs to make all the sushi so patience is a virtue here."}
{"text":"We love it , we go few times every month , it's clean and have fun environment. The food is good and come very fast . Everyone there is very nice and friendly ."}
{"text":"This has been both mine and my boyfriends favorite Sushi spot. There sushi is delicious. We came in for lunch today,  how ever I must say the service was a little poor this time around. We ordered multiple rolls and it took  about 20-25 minutes for them to bring us the last 2 rolls minding that it was just us & and another couple at a different table that were there so it was really slow. We also ordered drink menus & they were never brought out to us, Other than that  the food is great! I would definitely recommend the servers to be a little bit more attentive to there customers next time around though."}
{"text":"This place delivered the worst service I have ever gotten in Vegas. We ordered from Vince our waiter and right away he said the rolls will \"take a while.\" We waited an hour and a half before finally checking on our order only to find out that they had forgotten to place our order altogether! Vince our waiter said \"oh I thought that someone delivered it already\" there was not a sorry or anything. Vince had no regard for our time and gave the impression that he couldn't care less. We asked to speak to the manager who said she would get our food delivered right away. Another 30 minutes passed before we even received our order. They then refused to comp any of the 4 AYCE meals. They did offer house sangria that \"was just made this morning\"   We arrived at 7:00pm were seated at 7:45pm and didn't leave until 10:16pm. Do not come here unless you have hours to spare. Such a bad experience for my family that I had brought here from out of town. Terrible!"}
{"text":"Their prices for lunch and dinner are on par with other places in the area, and the food is delicious. All you can eat is great, but I've only had one extremely nice and prompt waitress. Others have been begrudging in their obligation to help the customer even if their tip depends on it, and I usually tip at least 20 percent. Even the host who sat us kind of seemed to not want to be there in the slightest. I totally understand working in food and bev industry, have done it for years, but for gods sake at least pretend to want to be there. Anyway, other than the shifty service, everything there is fabulous."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place more than the first oyshi. In my opinion, this is the best sushi place on this side of town. They have a lot of appetizers to choose from AND their nigiri is fantastic. I'm not a roll person, but they do sound pretty delicious. Service here is sometimes a hit or miss, personally I prefer when girls serve me because they're more attentive and provide better customer service than when I have a male server. I've been here many times that sometimes I'm greeted with \"welcome back!\" I normally recommend this place to friends or old co workers, and that says A LOT since I used to be a server at another sushi restaurant and I preferred this place over my old work. Keep in mind that I would get half off on everything at my old work but I would rather pay full price for better quality sushi over at Oyshi.  Tip: check out their daily specials by the sushi bar!~"}
{"text":"Must do AYCE! Definitely worth the price. Not only is the sushi AYCE, but the full menu as well. So you can get appetizers with your sushi. Fish is always fresh, and VERY tasty rolls. good, quick, friendly service, lots of seating, can be busy and a lil loud at times, so call for big groups. But i cannot say anything bad about this place. I'm very surprised it only has 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. I've eaten here a few times and was somewhat satisfied with my meal but nothing to boast about. Servers have been decent and the atmosphere is just ok."}
{"text":"$21 all you can eat sushi for lunch/$26 for dinner.   I love how their specialty rolls are included...and the rolls are made fresh (compared to most sushi buffets).  My favorite rolls were the love affair roll and the monster roll. Don't forget to get a dessert too! Their creme brulee is delicious! :)"}
{"text":"I have gone to this place for a couple of years. And every time I come in I can see their popularity is rising. They have add more seating area which is great. I don't think I've ever waited for 20mins for a table. The food is always good. Everything I've ever had their is yummy! They added a sizzling plate which I really enjoyed. They have a couple ppl that walk around just to clear your table which is awesome. Your table is never cluttered."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant with a meetup group.  I suppose we had 12 who met for AYCE lunch.  We all ordered so many different types of rolls and shared them.  I would have to say my favorite was the Pink Lady Roll.  That roll had several types of fish and wrapped in a pink soy wrapper.  Very nice.  We also tried the RockN' Roll, the Atomic Bomb, Salmon Lover, Yellowtail Trio, Hawaiian  and other specialty rolls.    After eating at a different AYCE near Summerlin I had a fresh comparison.  I found what we had was all very fresh and tasty, prepared to order.  We also had seaweed salsa, rib eye appetizer, ahi poke,  and desert was included, too.  I had strawberry mochi ice cream and tasted the green tiramisu.  Thomas was our waiter and was very attentive in locating each of us with our orders.  He was very good.  Yes, it did take a little while to wait for some of the rolls, but we were ordering a lot of food and the quality and taste made it worth the wait.    I will definitely be back with my friends and I'll bring a bigger appetite!"}
{"text":"Good food, but it takes toooooo long for food to be served. All you can eat is too expensive. The interior is nice and comfy."}
{"text":"great sushi and great service!!!!! Highly recommended!! Loved the creme Brule:) The ambience is pretty stylish and chill."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Oyshi, my first to the main dining room.  It was fairly busy, but we had a reservation and were seated immediately.  Our server was friendly and extremely prompt without being pushy at all!  She never let our drinks get completely empty and always made sure our plates were full!  My friend and I shared the Spicy Tuna Crunch and I devoured the Japanese Lasagna and the lobster/crab roll alone as he isn't a big fan of any warm sushi.  We also shared some Gyoza and the popcorn scallops (my favorite appetizer!) As always, everything was fresh and extremely tasty.  I can't wait for my next visit!!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I went here after shift .. we arrived 12:30am, we were told that last call is at 1am. They were going to close early that day. (Last call is usually 1:30am).. anyways, the reason why my friends and I went there is because one of us had a birthday. But the birthday boy was running late. He arrived after 1am, (past the 1am last call for that day) but they still took his order which I thought was kind of them to do. We didn't finish our food, but we only had to pay for two rolls extra. Again, that was a nice surprise. I was expecting to pay WAY more for the leftovers. I was highly expecting them to be mad or to show sings of irritation because they ended up not closing early and instead closed at the regular time of 2am. We were one of the last two groups there.. They were very accommodating throughout the whole time. Our server, Tony/Toni, was very friendly. She was very nice and always smiled throughout the whole dining experience. I think she was the one that recommended the 'love affair' which was really good!!! Anyways, during dessert, one of my friends joked around saying they were going to bring the birthday boy cake, but said it only as a joke. He said 'just kidding' and mentioned it was our friends bday which is why he said that. Tony/Toni asked if it really was our friends bday and later she came out with a green tea looking cake. I was very happy with the service !! The food was really good, but for me, service is important.. If a restaurant has good food, but really bad service, I would most likely not go back. Well Oyshi had good food AND great service! I am sold. I will be going back here soon! :)"}
{"text":"I decided to update this review because my recent visit was much better compared to three years ago. Came here with my family and we enjoyed the sushi. Everything was brought out on time and made well. Our waitress was nice and took our orders as quickly as possible and made sure each person got their orders right. My husband and I decided to try this place in the near future just the three of us when we can.  former review from 3 years ago: 2 Stars How this place ever got a vote for best sushi place in Las Vegas is beyond stupid. I know going there on father's day might have been a bad idea for AYCE. So 6 of us went in at 2pm. It was pretty full but people were starting to leave.  Yes we were seated immediately ( Which explains 1 star) and our first order of rolls and appetizers came out quick enough ( 1 more star) but they didn't even bring out ALL the first orders. I ordered a pink lady and it didn't even come out until 40 minutes  and it was my 1/2 of my FIRST ROLL. Then when it came out it looked like a 6 yr. old just grabbed mayonnaise and some seafood and loosely rolled it in soy paper. It was so big it fell apart. They might as well have just jammed the thing in a rice bowl and given me a spoon.It also tasted like the seafood part was sitting out.   At least the waitress that helped us was apologetic. I'm not returning here ever and if I was invited to come here I would just decline. I still rather go to Sushi Bay off warm springs for their faster service and better variety of sushi"}
{"text":"Service not friendly. Instead of greeting us when we came in, they told us they were closing in an hour. Fish was not fresh. Spicy tuna roll had an off fishy taste. Asked for no sauce on roll, but roll came with sauce. Overall was disappointed, would not recommend and will not go back. We only went there because our favorite sushi spot,soho, was not open."}
{"text":"January 11, 2017 @ 10:30pm   Let me begin by saying that this was the worst possible service ever! The food was okay and I have had much better, but this review is strictly based off of service. I've worked in the restaurant industry so I know that when an incomplete party of 8 show up at 10pm, it could be annoying, however, you don't let the customer know. Well, thats what the male busser with spiked black hair and glasses made clear last night. Every question I asked him about our table he would give a short answer and then turn his back on me immediately (Keep in mind, I worked as a hostess in Vegas for 6+ years, I know how to passive aggressively tell a customer F* you and this kid did it.) Next my friend and I asked if we could wait at the bar and grab a drink and wait for the rest of the party to show, then the hostess says,\"If you don't plan on buying anything.\" I get it, they don't want to transfer the bill or whatever, so fine, we wait. Our party arrives and then we are seated and our server, a lady, I don't know her name because she never introduced herself and made it clear we were annoying her. We ordered a lot of food and tons of sushi and when the sushi came out, the staff didn't even know the names of the rolls, so when we would send it back because we did recognize the names, she would immediately come back and act as if it was our fault and stated the correct names (wow). Towards dessert she lightened up a bit. We aren't a difficult crowd, we all work(ed) in the industry and understand the difficulties of customer service (I'm not saying we're saints because we work in the industry, but we are more courteous than most that don't).  I don't recommend this place for service, the sushi was alright. We ordered gyoza, rib eye (which they didn't ask which temperature and we were lucky to get beef jerky), miso soup, calamari, shrimp tempura, creme brûlée, mochi, and different flavor ice cream. It was all O.K. All you can eat was the best part of our experience."}
{"text":"This review is well overdue.   AYCE here is great - we were so impressed by everything we ordered.  We sat at the bar.  Thick cuts that melt in your mouth.  Fish or meat.. execution was perfect. You can't go wrong with any dish you order here, I really can't say that one was my favorite. I love them all equally.  Service was friendly but not overwhelming. We will most definitely be back to try other items on the menu when we are in Vegas..  I can't wait!"}
{"text":"As a person who eats at many different sushi places I was disappointed when it came to the rolls here. Although we enjoyed our appetizers and desserts we lacked in fulfillment in our sushi.   For a 5 order the size was well, but when it came to 6-8 piece orders the sizes were to larger as if they were buffing it with rice and lacking any taste. When eating sushi I want to enjoy it not have a mouthful of rice and if was a good size it felt as if the sushi chefs were using the crab as a crutch to fill most of the sushi. One of my most enjoyed rolls the rainbow roll consisted of no avocado, loads of crab, and poorly sliced pieces.   This is my third time here and I'll say that every experience here has been a gradual decrease of pleasure. The nigiri was enjoyable but that was all. The servers and bussers were pleasant but the sushi chefs were acting as if it was a middle school sleepover, gossiping with each other about customers instead of actually communicating with them."}
{"text":"First off! Ask to be sat in Ryan's section! My husband and I have never had a server with so much personality, so kind and made sure everything was perfect and we had everything we needed. Please, if he makes a suggestion then take it! He let us know about an item not on the menu. The burger and fries roll was phenomenal! As for the food. We tried the rainbow location and the food was good but I think the service at the Sarah location made our experience really stand out!"}
{"text":"Been here on multiple occasions. Food is always tasty and fresh. Service various from below average to above average depending on the day and the server. Sit at the Sushi bar instead of a table and your food will be much quicker."}
{"text":"This place is almost hidden, so you will probably miss it driving by.  I think it is the best sushi along the harbourfront and a better than average restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Food and Service is top notch!!!! Best Sushi spot I have ever been to! Ask for Ray as your waiter, he is phenomenal! This will definitely be our go too Sushi spot for now on!   So my review is fair the food coming to our table was a little slow towards the end but Ray made sure we knew what was going on and advocated in the kitchen for us. $145.00 for four people with all you can eat sushi and desert plus 4 sake bombs a sapporo and a large hot sake.  Update 4-13-2015 Sad Ray no longer works there. Food is still great and the new waitress was nice, but just average, not fun like Ray!"}
{"text":"I love the food here but the hostess staff is terrible. They literally don't even acknowledge you. I called the restaurant and was pput on an 8 minute hold before I eventually just hung up. If they restrained their front staff...this place would be awesome."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi I've ever had! I'm a regular. The service needs improvement. It's difficult to get tea refill or anything else after the order. The food is terrific, the place is cute and clean. The restaurant is extremely small. If you don't get a booth, it's rather uncomfortable with tables so close together."}
{"text":"I've had a lot better sushi than here at Oyshi. The rolls were a little sloppy and so was the information on the food we ordered. It didn't quite meet our expectations, but left me full. Service here is pretty sad. Best part of this place is the ambiance, but the music is killing it. Excited to get the check and leave. No plans on coming back to this location..."}
{"text":"First time eating at Oyshi & I give five stars for amazing food AND service. My friend and I had $26 all you can eat sushi with tea and sake. The food tasted great and came out really fast. Our server's name was Odi and she was the best waitress I've ever had. She checked on us often and had a very pleasant attitude. I would recommend this sushi spot to anyone in the area. This is my new favorite place for whenever I'm in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"The wait here wasn't bad she said about ten min and I think it was less. The food is good however, they brought out my appetizers with my sushi. Typically the appetizers should come out first. I understand the kitchen can be backed up sometimes though. I like that they had a variety of baked rolls and the music was good as well. The policy on all you can eat is that you cannot take any food home but that's OK I guess some places let you and some don't. All in all I would come back not far from me and the price is right."}
{"text":"This was our favorite place for years.  3 strikes make it a no go.  Came it late one night and was rewarded with terrible customer service even though there were very few people left in the place .  We left without being served btw .  Tried it again another night.  Same result.  Tried it a third times.  Got sick beyond comprehension .  And sorry Oyshi but never coming back and we were very loyal vegas locals and brought a ton of people in ."}
{"text":"I've came here too many times for an auditor to keep track. I've came here for a dinner date with my BF, to enjoy company of good friends, to celebrate birthdays and even left family stories here. What I mean to say is that.. This place is good for any occasion and anyone.  Of course they have ALLYOUCANEAT at 20sum dollars. Just ordering more than two dishes is already worth that 20sum. Different rice bowls (suchas unagi), surf&turf, baked mussles, desserts and so much more are included in your 20sum dollars. If there's anything specific I'm looking for in a sushi spot.. It would be Cajun Albacore & Tempura fried ice cream. This place doesn't have temp. ice cream, but they do have the best Cajun Albacore. The flavor is mouth watering! And you can't even see the rice with this huge savory slice over it. I eat these like chips!  The service here is pretty friendly, especially if you sit at the bar. I mean what's better than interacting with the chef making your food?! This place has three private rooms for group parties. One of them is a lounge with individual sofa chairs and a big LCD TV."}
{"text":"The sushi was not very good. I was underwhelmed by the rainbow roll. I couldn't finish my dish. It was just pretty bad.   The service was OK, they were a little overworked. It's hard to get a really good impression on one visit."}
{"text":"I love this sushi place. It has one if the biggest all you can eat menu I've ever seen. The service was a little slow at first but I'm a pretty easy going person. These rolls were amazing Love affair, Cater cheese, Full moon,Spider,& Rock and roll."}
{"text":"My husband and I make this our date night stop every couple of months. We have never been disappointed, The servers all help each other out which means my drink is never empty. Our food always arrives just in time before I get hangry ;) Make sure you go before dinner hour and you'll get in pretty quickly if you wait until after 6:30 then you'll have a 30-45 minute wait which to me is worth it to have delicious all you can eat sushi!! I wish their were more alcohol options but I'll deal with it:)"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place and my favorite AYCE sushi in Vegas.  The fish is always high quality and the appetizers and desserts are awesome and included in the price!"}
{"text":"Tried ayce sushi for the first time here. It did not disappoint!  The servers are attentive, but the food sometimes took a ridiculous amount of time to come out. I also think they forgot some of the rolls we ordered which was somewhat irritating but we just ordered again.  Get the rolls! The fish to rice ratio is awesome. The rolls are smaller than you'd expect though so don't be afraid to order lots. The gyoza and poke bowls are delicious.  Fish was fresher than I would have expected which was a pleasant surprise. They have oysters on a half shell as well. And uni!!! One per customer but still great.  The green tea creme brûlée was awesome. Tons of matcha flavor. Don't bother with the  green tea ice cream though - worst green tea ice cream I've ever had. Also don't bother with the yakitori it was disappointing.  Overall it was a successful first time for ayce sushi. I'd come back here again when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Oyshi Sushi is one of my all time favorite sushi bars in Las Vegas. I rate restaurants based on food, service, and atmosphere, making the highest possible score a 30. Oyshi gets a 25/30 thus the 4 star rating. If I could rate the food higher, I would, because it's truly what I love Oyshi for!   If you'd like to see my full review, and get a better idea of what Oyshi and its food is like, click below!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p24_mwKZvIg"}
{"text":"Very bad service! And place was empty! I ordered the tiger roll which by the way is great at the other location! First of all i think the server forgot about it because everybody in my party got their food, when i asked about mine she said she would ck and 5 mins later it came! Really not worth the wait, had to eat it because i was starbing, ordered tea and asked for sugar again server never brought it or refills, sad to see a beautiful place go, ladies bathroom was disgusting too! Would not recommend this location at all"}
{"text":"Driving down Rainbow with my dad and sister after some very exhausting furniture shopping, we decided to pick up sushi for dinner. There are several sushi restaurants along the way, so we pulled over to the first one we saw: Oyshi Sushi.   The restaurant is very cute, decked out in the typical Japanese style (fountains, folding screens) with a modern feel. It could serve well as a date spot or a family dinner outing, based on the groups of people I spotted. While we waited for our take-out order, the host offered us beverages, which was a very nice touch.  I tend to judge restaurants based on how vegetarian- and vegan-friendly they are, and this place definitely passed. There are at least 10 or 12 vegetarian rolls to choose from. I ordered the asparagus and avocado roll, vegetable tempura and miso soup. All of them were very good. The sushi in particular was well-made and tasty, which was surprising considering that this restaurant advertises its All You Can Eat special.   The prices are good, the food is better. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while I waited for my nail appointment next door. Amazing! Such a great serving size for a lunch special. I wasn't aware of this, as I ordered an extra roll.   Chicken teriyaki lunch Sizzling chicken teriyaki California roll Tempura Soup Salad   And my extra  Eel avocado roll.   Yes, I boxed it up to go!   Tempura is great.... Very lightly breaded.   Staff is obviously skilled in teamwork and costumer service. It wasn't just one person tending to me, they worked as a team.  I will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this sushi place. The interior is modern, it's cool for group dates or even just a solo trip. They're open late and you can order take out, so it's real convenient.  I order the spicy tuna crunch & the crazy cali from here, and they're both sooo good. :)"}
{"text":"Always great food. The dining area can get a little noisy when they are busy. They have private areas for big groups. The waiting area up front is limited and uncomfortable little stumps are all you have options to sit on. The bathrooms are routinely unkept and slightly dirty. Great all you can eat deals."}
{"text":"Great variety, great price, atmosphere. Best Screaming O I've tried at an AYCE place. Way better service and fish than the Sahara location"}
{"text":"This is probably one of most delicious sushi restaurant we've ever visit. Our waiter Lau was exceptional with a great attitude, 100% great service the restaurant itself is so clean. We will definitely come back again when ever we visit Vegas  double thumbs up"}
{"text":"Super service. Nice music and decorations.  Fantastic selection of rolls.  Got the rattle snake and Oyshi rolls.  I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered take out so I can't talk much about the actual restaurant.    The food was ready on time and was pretty good.  They gave me everything I needed for my meal which is always a bonus for take out.    I live nearby so I will probably be back.    Food was good, prices were average."}
{"text":"Got finish our meal... Sushi was superb, service was good but not great... The sushi was good and rice to sushi ratio was good, not too much rice to fill you up.. A lot of baked rolls... Good for kids...lots of options... Overall was one of the better AYCE sushi places in Vegas"}
{"text":"This WAS my favorite AYCE sushi place in Las Vegas. The size of the AYCE menu was great for the sushi lover (me) and the non-sushi lover (my wife). The service was always good and the creativity and execution of the rolls was awesome. Went last night with two of my guy friends. I owed one sushi for losing a bet and the other was tagging along. We ordered a few appetizers, some nigiri (12 pieces total between the three of us), and 4 rolls. It took about 20 minutes to get our food. When it came out it was not as good. I got a piece of salmon that had what I assume was cartilage that was like chewing on leather. I've never had that happen with sushi before. Obviously, sushi by nature is somewhat chewy, but this was inedible. We ordered a few more rolls and it took forvever for it to come out. The avocados on the caterpillar roll were browning. The waitress rarely came to check on us. Not what I had come to expect from this place, but from what I hear this is the status quo now. Will no longer make the drive out and instead go to I Love Sushi or Sushi Mon."}
{"text":"Chef AG ALWAYS takes care of me when i come in. He is a fantastic chef!  Absolutely nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"A friend of mine got a huge tray of sushi and sashmi from here , which we split for a board game night. Pretty good all around with lots of variety."}
{"text":"This is some seriously good sushi! And they are super quick!!!  The heart attack roll is a favorite!  The AYCE is soooo worth it!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, greater service, perfect for groups.   Walked in with a group of 11 friends and we were seated in a private room. It was perfect for our group and very relaxing. We all had AYCE.  Food came out faster than I expected, and not all at once. Service here gets an A+.   For  AYCE, sushi is very much up to par. It's not the best, but you definitely appreciate the taste. The best rolls were: Lobster flare, tiger roll, spider roll, and monster roll. Uni is good but you can only get 1 order.  Also, we saw that they ran out of ingredients or particular sushi (it's never fun to pay for AYCE only to find out the items you want had run out).   Still - great place.   Clean bathroom, so clean kitchen!"}
{"text":"This place is a disappointment it used to be good but the service has gone way down. Got there at 3:30pm with my other half was gonna go sit at the bar since it wasnt that packed maybe like 3-4 people sitting then one of the servers stopped us this short asian server and said it will be a few minutes because they only had 3 servers. There was 7 tables occupied and 3 people at the bar and 1 large party in the back, i mean i guess they are rookies and couldn't handle a party of 2. so we waited. 3:44 rolls around and decided to ask again then he said that he's waiting for the 4pm servers to show up! Wtf? U coulda told us that in the beginning or at least got us sat with glasses of water. So we left and NEVER GOING BACK THERE AGAIN. HORRIBLE SERVICE!"}
{"text":"The pro's fun ambiance, friendly staff, and quick service.  That being said the sushi here was lacking. We ordered the tuna poki, garlic albacore, salmon sashimi, and the screaming orgasm. The poki was mediocre but not bad. The salmon was also okay but once again not the best. The screaming orgasm was way over sauced in a creamy mayo sauce. I couldn't even taste the fish, although I do have to say they cut the tuna well. The worst was the albacore. It was bright red and tasted mushy and off. Needless to say we didn't finish it. I have a feeling if I want to find good sushi in this city I'm going to have to head to China Town."}
{"text":"Being from hawaii we have ALOT of great sushi restaurants, but i must say after living here for a little over a month and eating at a few different sushi places this by far is at the top of my list. I get the all you can eat because i can put down some sushi haha. The sushi here is sooooo good! The high roller, the different types of spicey tuna rolls, beef wrapped asparagus. So much variety and the service and staff is super quick and super friendly.  Then comes the desert, the deserts are awesome from green tea ice cream, to the mochi ice cream and some kind of berry ice cream cup, totally delicious.  The restaurant is easy to find and theres alot of free parking. You can also order individual rolls but i do suggest just doing the all you can eat buffet if you want to try a variety of the tasty items on the menu. They do serve alcohol as well and what better way to enjoy sushi then with some sake bombs and great friends! Definitely a place im bringing my friends from hawaii when they come to visit."}
{"text":"yum.  it's gooood here. hubby likes this place..  cool setting.. it's very chill.. they could put a halt on the continuous rave music. lol..  but it's cool.. whatever.  it's a good place.    all you can eat sushi for 21 bucks!  definitely keep the rolls on a minimum because it's easy to lose control in this setting. haha.. they have a lot of other things besides sushi.. must haves: ahi poke seaweed salad surf & turf garlic tuna calamari veggie & shrimp tempura.. ??? miso. haha  all the rolls start to look the same eventually..  just put together differently!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but the customer service sucks! We waited forever for our food and it wasn't even busy. I tried to give them a chance... Four chances infact and the service sucked every time. I will never recommend this place to anyone. I'm never coming back here."}
{"text":"I live nearby and have read over the rave reviews, but only recently managed to make it in for Oyshi's AYCE lunch. The selection is large, with several sides and apps, as well as grilled dishes, to supplement the nigiri and (massive list of) sushi rolls.  Definitely ask about the daily specials to ensure you are trying their freshest fish available: the scallop, smoked salmon, conch, and mackerel on my visit were all incredible. Nigiri portions are generous with thick-cut large pieces.   Favorite rolls are the CHUNG HUA (salmon tempura and garlic yum yum spicy tuna inside topped with white fish and avocado, spicy ponzu and sesame oil sauces): it's spicy and has a great mix of flavors without being too heavy, really liked the sauces. This roll is nicely balanced out by the YELLOWTAIL TRIO (yellowtail chunks, cucumber, gobo, kaiwari topped with yellowtail sashimi dressed in ginger sauce), which is a lighter roll with the fish and fresh cucumber as the stars.   Standout apps include the sashimi salad, the vegetable tempura, and the miso soup (generous portion, lots of seaweed, and a savory-not-salty broth). The must-get orders for us include the Chung Hua roll above, a selection of nigiri, and incredible MACKEREL SPECIAL HANDROLLS, with gobo, kiwari, and cucumber.  Extra star for great service: Jesus is my favorite server f(rom another restaurant) and his attention to detail is unsurpassed. If you've never had a server recognize you across town and greet you by name, you might not understand. Jesus is the best, request him specifically if you are going for a special occasion or as a large group."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time with friends .. The last two times I was in they tried to charge me AYCE for my TWO YEAR OLD! Seriously?! She eats a few pieces of edemame and maybe a piece or two of sushi.. The sushi has always been ok.. Not bad for the price.."}
{"text":"Just came here tonight. Our server, Odi, is awesome. We got AYCE, and she recommended a lot of great stuff to us. She also comes back to explain the dishes to us after somebody else serves it; we liked that. Just me and my boyfriend. With green tea and AYCE, bill came up to $58, without the tip.   We had: POKE SALAD - 3/5 - Maybe I should've eaten the fish with the rest of the salad because I ate all the fish first. My bad! Fish was so fresh.  SEAWEED SALAD - 4/5 - Pretty good.  OYSTERS - 3.5/5 - Pretty good.  TIGER ROLL - 4/5 - I liked this one, but my boyfriend said it's just alright.  MONSTER ROLL - 4.5/5 - We both liked this one.  SHRIMP SKEWERS - 5/5 - Great. I like the sauce, and the shrimp is delish! ASPARAGUS - 2.75/5 - My boyfriend said he didn't like meat wrapped around it. Ironically, that's the only thing I liked about it.  SURF AND TURF SIZZLING PLATE - 3.75/5 - I like the shrimp, but the beef was just alright.  UNI - 4.5/5 - First time having Uni. It was delicious! We would've ordered more if we weren't getting full already.  LOVE AFFAIR ROLL - 4.75/5 - We both loved this one. But my boyfriend later complained it was sweet, which I completely didn't understand because I didn't think it was sweet.  GREEN TIRAMISU - 5/5 - I like that it's not too sweet. It's perfect ending to your meal. It melts in your mouth. We love this one.  CREME BRÛLÉE - 5/5 - We also love this one. The server said they got reviewed as having the best creme brûlée in the city. It was really good. The glaze is delish, but it's also delish without the glaze.   We'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for lunch and got their all you can eat option. There is a nice variety of sushi rolls, and various appetizers and side dish options to choose from. The atmosphere is upscale and pleasant. Our server was nice and brought our food out quickly. Everything we ordered was delicious. Would definitely recommend this restaurant for all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"This location is bigger and nicer than the one on Rainbow, I believe it is newer too. Came here with a friend for AYCE lunch. Lunch price is $23 or $24 and dinner is $27 if I remembered correctly Dinner price comes with oysters, uni, and sweet shrimp. We came in right when they opened, we were the first table for the day. Not sure what was going on but the hostess was not having it, she was not friendly and seemed annoyed having to seat us. She also helped ran food to our table and same attitude, grumpy and not happy, made us feel uncomfortable.   Our server was very nice, made recommendations and our drinks were constantly re-filled throughout our meal.   They have nice variety of rolls, lot of appetizers and other dishes you can order as part of your AYCE which is great. Rolls were pretty good, some better than others but overall I had a satisfied meal.   I have been to other places where the dinner price was lower and it comes with oysters, uni and sweet shrimp. $27 is pretty expensive for AYCE, especially since there are so many other AYCE places that offer similar options.   Overall, it was nice to try the place since my friend comes here all the time and she wanted me to try it out, but it wasn't as great of an experience for me. The hostess was the first turn off, and although the food was good I can go elsewhere for similar items but a little cheaper."}
{"text":"It saddens me to write this review because I really used to like Oyshi. We were so excited when they first opened, as there weren't any sushi restaurants nearby. We came here often and really enjoyed it. As time went on, we noticed changes in staff and service suffered. They also got busier, thus orders were taking way too long.   The food has always remained pretty good (in my opinion). But good food doesn't make up for bad service or a bad experience.  The good news is, they have another location on Sahara, which is farther away from me, but less busy and usually has better service."}
{"text":"Very good sushi!! I came here with my friend Jill for all you can eat sushi. The staff is awesome with such great personalities. I am so glad they can make one of my favorites which is the Japanese Lasagne:-) They have a delicious parfait dessert that we both got. The drinks we great too I had a Princess Peach..mmmmnm good:-)"}
{"text":"Oyshi definitely has one of the most expansive AYCE selections in Vegas. Lots of appetizers are also included, my favorite being the Surf and Turf. The fish is always very fresh, and their special rolls are inventive and delicious! There are a few reviews that specifically mention the Monster Roll. I like it, but I find it very difficult to eat due to the size. My favorites are the Sunrise Roll and the Hawaiian Roll.   I would avoid coming here during the lunch or dinner rush unless you're sitting at the counter, though...service tends to get really, really slow when they're busy and sometimes items from my order are forgotten. They do get very busy, so just keep that in mind.   Oyshi is by far the best sushi restaurant on the southwest side, and despite some slow table service during their busiest hours and some sloppy sushi-making when they are extremely busy during weekend dinners, I will definitely continue to frequent it when I'm in the mood for sushi.  Oh, and make sure to save room for dessert: the Green Tea Tiramisu is amazing!"}
{"text":"Variety versus Service - this is my headliner for this place.  The menu is excellent, and by that I mean I have many choices, in fact too many that on my second visit here, I think i have only tried an eight of their items. Quality and freshness of their seafood are outstanding, and I've had them on roll, sushi, and sashimi.  The stand-outs are: Miso soup, Ahi Poke, Shrimp tempura, Calamari, Surf and Turf, Eel and Avocado, Creme Brulee.... food is four stars hands down.  Now, the service is not the most accommodating, I'm afraid to say. Some cons on my last visit: our waiter forgot our three orders of Calamari and had to be reminded, as we waited for a good twenty minutes, grave sin on customer service definitely. For the pros, we were greeted and seated very quickly and our drinks were refilled readily and I appreciated the fact that our waiter apologized for making us wait on our calamaris. In the end, I would give them three stars and believe that they could do better by following up with an order."}
{"text":"I'm going to preface this by saying I'm not a fan of sushi, but I went with a group of friends who are. Luckily, Oyshi has a lot of options that aren't sushi, with large selections of sizzling plates and teriyaki and the like. I don't even know what I got; some kind of chicken skewer and beef-wrapped asparagus from the entree menu. Both were pretty tasty, though I wish there was more beef on the asparagus. Most everyone else I was with got the AYCE sushi and seemed to love every dish that came out. The place had a trendy vibe, with an eclectic mix of top 40 music playing and everything was plated beautifully. The service was amazing, the prices were really good, and it wound up feeling like a really special occasion, when all was said and done. I definitely recommend Oyshi!"}
{"text":"After being seated it took 20 min to be greeted by our waitress to take drink orders. Delivery of sushi rolls took way longer than appropriate and were incorrect twice. For two girls to eat 5 rolls of sushi for all you can eat took two hours. The all you can eat price is way too high for the service and quality of food."}
{"text":"If it was possible to give no stars, Oyshi would be the one. I thought I would give this place a second try being it has a few years since I first went. The host quoted a 30 minute wait, but we got sat at a table pretty quickly. I had asked our server, Ploi, if they do half rolls and she did say that I would either have be at the bar or eating AYCE, which I did mention my girlfriend and myself were both doing AYCE and I also let her know my girlfriend is allergic to avocado. Our first order consisted of a few appetizers but the wait was ridiculous, 15 minutes had passed and nothing came by while this was happening a party of 4 was just sat next to us and they got their food in less than 5 minutes. Ploi walked by and asked if we wanted to order any more I was getting impatient so I decided to order some rolls and asked if I can get half rolls, she mentioned that I would have be sat at the bar and have AYCE which disregarded the statement she made when I first asked about half rolls. Which is stupid why only have half rolls at the bar. Anyways I put in my orders and those came out pretty quick they messed up a couple of the salmon nigiri I had ordered 3 orders but they only gave us 2. After about 40 minutes our appetizers finally came but we ordered 3 orders of shrimp tempura and they only gave us 1 order and we noticed that the kitchen was coming out with plate fulls of shrimp tempura to every other table besides ours, we had to keep reminding our food runners that we ordered more than what we received. Another thing noted was a food runner gave us a rainbow roll that we did not order which had avocado, and my girlfriend is highly allergic to avocado so I dont know why they didn't make sure it was going to the right table. More time passed we made a few more orders of rolls and appetizers but those took another 30 minutes and the tables next to us keep getting their food right away. I'm sorry but perception wise that's not okay. I was still hungry but I did not want to wait another 30 minutes for my orders to come. I will not be returning to Oyshi. I've been to sushi places with very how volume in chinatown; they were more efficient running food and their servers have a better sense of urgency. I will not be returning to Oyshi."}
{"text":"The best sushi place in the Las Vegas area.  If you are staying on the strip, come to this all-you can eat place and you will have a great experience.  PS... sit in Pedros section ... the best!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. Clean and staff are super helpful and awesome. Their double screaming roll stupidly awesome, along with their tasty deserts like green tea crème brulee. Its a must go to for the best sushi in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"A friend, and LV resident, brought a group of us here.  We were blown away the 1st time--$25 AYCE Sushi?!?!  (everything on the menu except sashimi).  Food and service was great that time.  But on the 2nd visit, there was a longer wait, prices had gone up and quality went down.  We all got horrible stomach aches and dehydration for hours after.  It's a great deal, but you'll pay the price."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with our first visit to this restaurant. We waited nearly 25 minutes to be seated when there were open tables scattered throughout the place. Wine was served in tiny glasses, and beer served with warm ones. Half of or orders were executed improperly. The temperature in the restaurant was too warm and our table too small for our party. Our server checked his watch several times while taking our various orders. An awful experience."}
{"text":"I like this place. Love their dynamite roll and spicy salmon. The dynamite roll contains all my favorites - spicy salmon, yam, shrimp and teriyaki sauce.  People here are very nice too.  The new sweet & sour chicken however was not comparable to those Chinese restaurants. But I'm here for sushi so I'm happy."}
{"text":"Great \"all-you-can-eat\" deal! Food is very good with friendly staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"For $21 (lunch) or $26 (dinner) you can indulge in all you can eat sushi and sides. The difference between lunch and dinner is that lunch excludes oysters and something else they list on the front of the menu. Aside from that, you can indulge in any roll or hot item. Sashimi's off limits.   Keep in mind that the rolls, regular priced, run for about $13 each so you might as well pay the $26 the ayce option and sample as much as you feel like... unless you're one of those freaks that can eat ONE roll and be satisfied...   The catch to the rolls was as I suspected- tons of rice. One roll was so loaded that I felt my body refusing to chew any more of it. The sushi was another story- the amount of rice was fair. Oh, and sidenote, you're charged regular price for anything you remove or fail to consume the rice from.   It seems that the best way to fill up without tapping out too early is to focus on the hot items and sushi- fill up on surf and turf, calamari, and ahi poke salad and pick maybe one or two rolls that sound too good to deny yourself of them. Or, you could be me and go roll crazy and have to fight yourself to chew.   There are very tempting dessert options, of which you're limited to one (sad!) Bring friends and share all four. The mochi (mango or raspberry) was tiny, but I can imagine it was a refreshing treat. I had the creme brulee and my friend had the green tiramisu. Both were absolutely wonderful. The green tiramisu was a first for me and it was so exciting to eat. Creamy, yet subtle, yet sweet.   The only qualm I have with my experience was that we were there on a day when the sushi kitchen was hopelessly backed up. All of our hot food came out quickly, but the sushi took what felt like forever to appear. It became an issue for friends who didn't order hot food and waited well over an hour to eat anything.   Luckily the two-hour ordering limit was not applied to us or else this would be a fishy deal!"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for a stubborn friend, we would have gotten here earlier and avoided a \"long\" wait.  This friend said take the 95, take the 95, blah blah blah.  Even after the waiter said take the 215, my friend INSISTED on taking the 95.  The waiter probably said: \"whatever, dude, get lost and then wait longer and have your friends kick your ass before you eat our delicious buffet\".  After another friend looked Oyshi Sushi himself, we found out that we should take the 215 and did so after I got all frustrated driving in the 15 fwy traffic.  In any case, after waiting and getting seated at our table, we went straight to ordering our all-you-can-eat, which includes 2 uni (sea urchin) pieces, 2 amaebi (raw, sweet shrimp) pieces & 4 raw oysters.  Yep, there's a limit on those but you must understand that there aren't that many other places that would even give you these premium sushi pieces.  Just a note on the uni - slightly less fresh than I've had before.  In any case, you get these in addition to their fresh & delicious sushi.  Their salmon, yellowtail, albacore, halibut sushis are great, plus they don't give you as much rice in their sushi as other places.  Their rib-eye teriyaki is also an excellent dish to have.  Their tempura is also very good.  As for the dessert, we all had the strawberry mochi ice cream, which was very good.  All for $25 per person.  Not bad at all.  I only have to mention a couple of cons: there is a 1 dessert limit for each person.  However, you can have all the ice cream you want since this is not considered one of the dessert items.  Plus, I find it just strange that the place is so huge and yet they waste so much space & put tiny little tables in the center when you can get bigger tables there to accommodate more people.  Last con... service.  A bit slow.  It was a really busy night, but I'm still surprised that they took more than 15 mins to take out raw food.  There was a 2-hr limit, but I don't think they pushed this limit all too much."}
{"text":"Pretty place, clean and good service. Their baked rolls are really good. I would recommend to try"}
{"text":"There's no other food out there that I can say that I could every single day.  With as much sushi choices as there are, who can ever get tired of eating it?! Seriously. When I first discovered this place, I was so enamored by their flavor and service, that I told every single person looking for a good place to eat, local or tourist, that they HAVE to go to Oyshi Sushi and get AYCE!  I'm a big fan of nigiri and I highly recommend their nigiri because the ratio of fish to rice is 80-20. The fish they use is very fresh and they use a huge slice! OMG! My top list of nigiri: Cajun albacore, salmon, and eel! Have to have it every time.  Also highly recommended: Love Affair, Salmon Lover, Sunrise, and Red Dragon.  Their appetizers are awesome as well, but the ones that stick out the most that some sushi bars don't have are: Surf & Turf, Potato Croquette, grilled beef asparagus, and the Unagi (eel) bowl! Mmmmm!  They also do dinner reservations if you have a large party coming. They have VIP rooms that can accommodate large parties if you call ahead.  I've sat in their VIP rooms and their chairs are extra comfortable. The dining area near the entrance has a huge mural that gives this place it's feel and vibe. If you speak to the sushi chefs, they're pretty funny too! And if you're cool with waiting a little bit to be seated, get your Oyshi on!"}
{"text":"I have been here about a dozen times and I will probably return. I really like the quality of their sushi and the extensive selection of appetizers. The quality of service, however, leaves MUCH to be desired. It takes, on average, about 30 minutes for the sushi to get to your table from the time you order it. It totally ruins the flow of the dinner. Take today, for example. The server came to our table 30 minutes after taking our order with two dishes in her hands and asked, \"Did you order the Dynamite Roll and the Lobster Fair?\" To which I replied, \"I don't remember. It was so long ago, but I'll take whatever you're willing to give me.\" Good sushi. Nice staff. Inefficient business."}
{"text":"This place never lets us down in quality, the sushi always tastes amazing, even the baked dishes are worth the trip. This last time we went we tried the AYCE, it's worth the money if you are hungry enough!"}
{"text":"Dislike!!!! I don't even know why I even bother coming to oyshi's anymore. I gave them so many chances & I swear this is the last straw. I think I have given it so many chances because it's so close by my house.   Oyshi problem is waiting too damn Long for  our order.  we get there at 1:45pm, didn't order til about 2pm. our food order came at 2:40pm. talk about annoying & getting super impatient. I feel like the waiters talk so much more with co workers that they don't even care that there are so many hungry people there. & to top it off they never ask for drink refills. never once I got my cup of coke refilled. ridiculous I tell you. I usually can stuff myself with a good amount of sushi, but buy waiting & waiting, my hunger just went away.   sushi wise, it's alright!! it's not the greatest fish I've tasted. it could be better . only thing good I have to say about oyshi is there ice cream parfait & creme brûlée for dessert.   I will never go back again. unless my dinner gets paid for!!! otherwise it's just another disappointment."}
{"text":"Oni and andi are awesome! This place is one of our favorite. Super fresh sushi and great service. Definitely recommend both locations in Vegas! You can't go wrong with Oyshi Sushi"}
{"text":"So disappointed!  Went to this place for lunch nd felt so uncomfortable. I asked to be seated at the bar bc I was alone nd pregnant, so I thought it was good to see how they handle the food beside I expected it to be fun nd fast. I did all u can eat. Waited 30min for my app: gyoza. The chefs never said hi or even looked at my direction with care or happiness. \"I have been always greeted at a bar/sushi bar\", it is the least they can do. One of the chef made a silly comment as soon as I arrived at the bar, after that I knew I was at the wrong place. From 4 different kind of rolls I would only came back for 1 (maniac roll) it was the only one spice with no sweet sauce or fake crabmeat. Everything else was just blah blah blah. The service was polite but slow nd confused. I never had a refill on my water. Their (management/sushi chef) seems like to kiss the good looking/well dressed ppl ass. Everyone else were mistreated including myself. This was the worse place I have ever been. I would never come back here once I won't put my best clothes just to someone treat me with respect. Besides for 1 single good roll??? Forget it. I would prefer to drive to 808 sushi that' is not fancy but better quality sushi and a way better service. . The first roll I had was the monster (every single piece of it fell apart when trying to eat it. every single roll were ugly and tasteless except for the super sweet sauce and super sweet crabmeat combination they put on everything. My experience at this place lasted around 1 1/2hour bc it would take between 25-35 min for every order. Plus 20min for the check. In the end I can say: The only good thing about this place is that you can do half order... That's all."}
{"text":"This is the best all you can eat sushi. The sushichefs are all amazing! They are so helpful and goodlooking"}
{"text":"This place is good if u want an easy all you can eat sushi restaurant. The quality of fish is of the all you can eat kind (not the best) but it's a nice layout and the have a big room in the back for large parties"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews, I came here with high expectations. We got the \"all you can eat\" sushi. It took us about 30 minutes to receive each order. The waiter didn't bother to check on us unless he had food to deliver. And the Sushi was warm. I've had way better sushi at other places then what we we're served at Oyshi. And the oysters we're only 2 per customer. So don't expect all you can eat oysters. We stayed about an hour and 45 minutes at Oyshi. Half of the time we just sat there looking around for our waiter to come by and refill our drinks. The best thing on the menu we're the baked mussels."}
{"text":"This has quickly become my favorite sushi place since the time it opened. I eat here at least three times per week.  I love my usual server Mikey, he truely is the best.  Great serverice, excellent timing, and delicious food.  I recommend Oyshi Sushi to anyone and everyone who asks me about where they shoukd go for good all-you-can-eat sushi.  They are located on the southeast corner of Sahara and Tenaya. Open until 10pm."}
{"text":"I think the best way to enjoy sushi is to eat it proportionally and slowly. Oyshi has an awesome AYCE service, but what's even better is the portion size. They give you just the right amount to satisfy your taste bud and to keep ordering more. The server, Odi, did a great job at taking our orders down and the food delivery time was better than expected. Price was fair and affordable. I sure would like to see Sashimi available for lunch. ;)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing whenever you go here and order all you can eat tell the waitress to order you her favorite they do amazing job and if you seat on the bar chef ED does amazing rolls that are not in the menu thank you chef ED for the mucho spicy roll !!"}
{"text":"The best sushi in the world!! The menu is huge... and the best thing is the \"all you can eat\". Everytime i stay in vegas i go to oyshi!  I recommend!!"}
{"text":"I've been here NUMEROUS times with my family and friends and has always received good service.  Finally had a chance to take my sister out for sushi for her belated birthday.  We could of gone to our favorite place Naked Fish but they don't have AYCE and I wanted to take my sister to a place she never been.  Get there around 7pm.... Its not busy so I figure PERFECT even better don't have to wait for table or probably wait long for our food.... WRONG!!!!!!!  They sat us down but we wanted a lil more quiet area so we can catch up.  Asked to sit at the table where I always sit with my family.  That corner table was like a fridge!!!!  My sis asked to see if they can turn off vents above us or do something, the woman server said its just the fan only and will have it lowered.   .... Said we will both have AYCE and that it was my sisters 1st time here so she showed her menu and what was not part of the AYCE.  We ordered 3 order of shrimp tempura n poke and other items.  Got the items but no poke n tempura... Place our 2nd round order and questioned where is the surf n turf, tempura n poke.....\" Oh its coming \"..... Asked Manager for another beer with 2 cold glasses n again stated we waiting on 2 surf n turf.... Finally he brings it out NOT SIZZLING n not hot!!  While other table in corner has there's coming out sizzling n smoking??!!!!!  My sis looked at me like WTF??!!!!  ALL DURING THIS TIME ITS STILL COLD AS F**K AND OUR FOOD WAS GETTING COLD BY THE SECOND!!!!!  Ask server in jokingly way if there's a jacket or blanket since its still cold.... She said I'll tell them to lower the fan.  Ummmm weren't u suppose to do that when we 1st sat down????  ..... Placed 3rd round, asked BTW we still waiting on our shrimp tempura and poke!!...... FINALLY GOT IT but only 2 orders of shrimp tempura!  At this time we were cold AF so stepped out to warm up.  Came back in and server said we turned off the fan for you.  ????.... After fact we sat here over an hour?????  So we order dessert vanilla creme brulé which was good but we were still cold AF!!  Fan stop but a/c still felt like it was blasting only on us??!!!  NEVER have I ate there in that same spot and was that cold nor felt any type of draft on me!!!  .... By this time I was furious since we had to ask numerous times for our food plus while placing our order there was a long period of time to receive our food and let me remind you IT'S SLOOOOOOW!!!!!!   It been busier before and I had better service!  ......   Wrote a note on my receipt and HAND DELIVERED TO THE MANAGER!  NOW LET ME SAY THIS, I'VE DEALT WITH HIM TWICE PRIOR TO THIS HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND HE WAS NICE AND VERY SOCIAL MAKING SURE WE WERE HAPPY WITH OUR EXPERIENCE THERE.  \"THIS TIME\" HE HAD AN ATTITUDE OF A DEBBIE DOWNER IDGAF ATTITUDE!!  NEVER ONCE SMILED OR ASK HOW'S THINGS GOING..... WHEN I PERSONALLY GAVE HIM MY TAB AND SAID THERE'S A NOTE IN IT ALL I GOT WAS A \"OK\"?!!!!  WHAT A POOR SORRY UNPROFESSIONAL MANAGER TO HAVE AT A RESTAURANT!  WHERE'S YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS????  NEVER BOTHERED TO ASK A QUESTION OR TRY TO RECTIFY THE HORRIBLE EMBARRASSING SERVICE WE RECEIVE AND IN FACT THAT I RAVED ABOUT THIS PLACE ON THE WAY THERE TO MY SISTER TO ONLY BE ASHAMED I TOOK HER THERE!!!  ..... EVERYONE ASKED WHY I EVEN BOTHERED TO TIP??!!!!  I GAVE 15% TIP IN SPITE OF THE HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!.....  NEVER COMING BACK NOR WILL I EVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!!  AFTER SPEAKING WITH SEVERAL OF MY COWORKERS AND FRIENDS, MAJORITY ALL SAID THEY STOP GOING THERE BECAUSE OF TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!  NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"We went for a late lunch.  The place wasn't crowded yet the service was a bit slow.  We were seated at the sushi bar but the sushi chefs seem to engrossed with their work that we had to wait to catch their eye so we can put more orders in.  Good thing there was some kind of shift change and the newer chef at least asked us once if we wanted to order more.    As for the food, we started off with nigiri sushi, then moved on with the specialty rolls.  I quickly realized that their fish wasn't 100% fresh when it was laying simple and bare as nigiri sushi.  However, they do concoct good sauces and compose interesting rolls (maybe to compensate for the lesser quality of the fish).  The weird thing I noticed when we ordered unagi... In all other sushi bars I've been to, unagi is broiled for a few minutes before making it into sushi to give it nice caramelization.  Here, they skip it, and while the unagi seems slightly warm, it was not crispy and the flavor was a bit muted (I think broiling intensifies the flavor).  I guess next time I will ask them to make it \"extra crispy\"."}
{"text":"Love this sushi place. Great atmosphere and food. Big selection with great service... my favorite is the super white tuna!"}
{"text":"I like Oyshi. It's reasonably priced (especially given its prime location in the Harbourfront area bordering the Financial District), the selection is fair, the ambiance is cozy, and the service is just fine. I came with a friend for dinner last Friday at 7:30pm. There was a brief wait (~5 mins) but we didn't mind as it gave us an opportunity to explore the menu. It was packed - except for 1-2 seats at the sushi bar in the front, everything was taken and a line had formed! I find that to always be a good sign that a restaurant has a strong and loyal customer base.  Anyways, on to the most important matters - the food! We ordered the tempura, spicy salmon roll and the salmon chirashi.   Tempura: Great! Good portion. The shrimp were delicious - so crispy! There was something in here that tasted different (a bell pepper?) but nothing disappointed. Good start.  Spicy salmon: The filling:rice ratio was definitely favourable. These were pretty good, but were a bit colder than I'm used to. On second thought I may have wanted to opt for a hot maki option - shrimp tempura roll, maybe? They have many. What I wish they had were maki platters to share - it surprised me that the menu didn't seem to have these as I've found it to be a staple in other restaurants regardless of location.   Salmon chirashi: My friend ordered this and seemed to think it was great. I had a bit and it was just as I would expect - fresh and nicely balanced with a heaping white rice.   Service: A-OK  Overall - I'd like to make more creative choices in selection before I can make a solid conclusion. Everything I had was just fine, but I've heard wonderful things about Oyshi and need to see what is hidden in the menu that has made this place a go-to for so many of my colleagues!"}
{"text":"It seems the quality has dropped in service and sushi. One theory my friend has is that it just gets bad at peak times. Lunch and dinner time on the weekends and holidays.  Understaffed maybe?   Our ahi poke seemed less than Fresh. Our shrimp tempura seemed rushed and not fully fried. Sushi rolls took forrreevvver to come out. And it seems like the creme brûlée serving gets smaller each time we visit."}
{"text":"While I was visiting my cousin in Las Vegas, we decided to try Oyshi Sushi.  The atmosphere was nice, the presentations were creative, and  great variety of rolls as well as decent prices. They have an all you can eat sushi menu that is perfection!  The only downside for me is that they only used imitation crab meat instead of real crab meat."}
{"text":"Employees use the public bathroom. Public bathroom has no soap and there is toilet paper and water all over the floor. Employees then handle your food. No more is needed. But I'll go on anyways. Food was comparable to the finest prepared trash, it was undercooked or not cooked correctly. And all the server could do is say that she was sorry. There was no emotion in her apology and there wasn't a manager present. Don't go here."}
{"text":"I went there with my girlfriend and her brother for my girlfriends birthday last year. The place was pretty neat if you ask me. The restaurant was nice, plenty of open space with good music playing.  We went there for the \"all you can eat\" menu and we were not disappointed. There are only a few sections on the menu that were not included in the all you can eat price, but other than that the majority of the menu was free range. From appetizers to desserts, countless rolls and entrees this place really was a feast for the eyes and stomach.  But the only downside, there's only so much sushi you can eat before it just gets gross. After a few appetizers and 3 or 4 different rolls, we were ready to call it a night. From experiences at other sushi restaurants, this place was mediocre. The fish could have been fresher, but I'm guessing with the \"All You Can Eat\" staple on their menu, they get whatever fish they can and throw it in a roll.  This place was cool, but the long drive and mediocre cuisine left me wanting more from a sushi restaurant than just looks. I'd go back, I just wouldn't get the all you can eat offering again."}
{"text":"I can't go to another sushi restaurant  in Las Vegas.  Oyshi is the best one there and the $26 all you can tops it off.  This is not a buffet restaurant,  you order when you want more which makes the food fresh and hot.  My favs are the lobster lover, pork belly, salmon hand roll.   Oyshi is definitely a must try if you're ever in the area."}
{"text":"Great food, horrible customer service! I always recommend this place for sushi, will no longer do that after today's experience. One person from the table had all you can eat and I did not, not sure if that had something to do with this bad experience."}
{"text":"Well worth the price and delicious. We have been to this location several times. Never disappointed. We always go for AYCE. More than fairly priced. $23 for lunch $28 for dinner. EJ, our server was attentive and helpful along with the assisting staff. Great timing.  My typical order: mussels, potato croquettes, vegetable tempura, oysters, sea urchin (uni), masago, the heart attack roll & creme brûlée.  Yes, I come to eat! My boyfriend usually gets down on at least 4 rolls plus AYCE appetizers which tally up to far more than $28. Usually hear hip-hop playing, which I like, so if you don't like the combo of AYCE & hip-hop, stay home.  [no one wants to hear you whine about the music selection] Just know you're missing out. They're open late for the night owls too. Check out their hours. We will continue to enjoy this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend absolutely loves this place. He's not really into AYCE sushi places, but he LOVES this one. Me? Yup, I thought it was pretty good too. Love that they give you small portions, so that you can try more things, and you don't get stuck trying to finish something you don't like. ~$26 per person for AYCE dinner. This includes everything on the menu except sashimi. Some of our favs were the Hawaiian Ahi Poke, Nigiri, Tiger Roll, and for dessert, Green Tea Ice Cream. It's about a 10 minute drive off the strip. Great for large parties, but make reservations. We went on a Monday night, and though we were able to get seats right away at 5:45pm, the place was pretty busy by the time we left.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been a long time fan of Sushi Mon for quite some time now. Wanted to give another AYCE sushi spot a try. Pulled up Yelp and this was one of the places with good reviews. First time coming here, it felt weird, like i was 'cheating' on Sushi Mon. It's a completely different restaurant. Different atmosphere with the trance music playing in a dimly lit restaurant.  To my surprise, the sushi was excellent! The cuts were amazingly generous and good quality too. I had to try the rolls, which I normally don't and it was great too! Didn't have any complaints at all.   We had the green tea tiramisu and it was really good, and I was already stuffed. So that says something about it. Only bad part is, you only get one order of dessert... dunno if that's a good thing or bad thing."}
{"text":"This place was an absolute gem for my friends & I! We all went for the all you can eat dinner option. Fast, quick service."}
{"text":"Good decent food. Few different appetizers which you don't usually see in other AYCE's (which is a nice change). Really like the green tea tiramisu.  Didn't like the service though. Was very slow. There were only 7 tables occupied. The sushi's were served first (before the appetizers) 20 minutes AFTER they got our orders !!! And there were 5 sushi chefs working. One of them was busy taking a video of the other chef making a sushi roll. We never wait that long at other sushi places where there are only 2-3 chefs. Most of our appetizers came after the sushi rolls. They forgot a couple of orders but we didn't bother telling the waiter cuz we didn't want to wait another lifetime."}
{"text":"Some of my friends advised me to try this place! I came at 11:30 and by 12p.m. the place was packed!!! Service is great and fast, good is good and very affodable! I took lunch special for 13$(plate of sushi+ miso+salad) + egg rolls, all came out 18$. I liked not overslted miso soup and not greasy eggrolls, sushi rolls were perfect. Not fancy place, but cute, with Circus Du Solei posters :)"}
{"text":"Love it... Cozy and comfy... And the sushi is pretty good too...!"}
{"text":"Compared to Oyshi Sushi in Sahara, this place is loser in taste.  We could not find any fresh fish and the appetizers are salty or poor looking.   Only one that pleased us is ice cream as a dessert.   I and my friend agreed not to come back again and not to recommend this place.  If you want to go AYCI sushi, rely on yelp review."}
{"text":"It's  never a miss. I love this place. The food is always great the service is always on point. I love that they have a new location its a little closer to me. There new location is really beautiful, nice an open much bigger"}
{"text":"Normally, when you come into Japanese Sushi Restaurant they greet you even the chef. However, the host didn't bother to say hello until we came closer to the booth. I know the Oyshi off Rainbow has a lively feel than this location.  The place was nice seemed bigger than the Oyshi off Rainbow. My friends and I had to eat all you can which was $27. Plus, they have $5 cocktails on Wednesday & Thursday!! The cocktails were $10 so it would be 50%. I ordered the Moscow mule it was very refreshing not as strong as the Yoshi Mojito or the Lychee?   As far as for the sushi it was no doubt bomb dot com! Especially the high roller... I love sushis with cream cheese it makes everything so tasty in my mouth. I'd recommend to come with a party if you're planning on eating all you can eat otherwise I'd just order my fave rolls to save a few bucks.   Our waitress was also the host Chloe, I'd say she was nice when it came to taking our orders she was very patient."}
{"text":"Amazing beyond belief!!! My third visit here was on Valentine's Day and I can't tell you how impeccable their service was and how delicious their unique creations were!! Never thought It'd be possible to feel like a queen choosing to go solo. Oyshi chefs never disappoint and their AYCE is the best from anywhere I've been to across dozens of states and countries"}
{"text":"One hour wait. Okay this place has to be somewhat of a decent AYCE sushi. No. Just honestly go next door to Soyo and save your $27 bucks.   We finally sat down and didn't see the waitress again for another 15 minutes. We ordered a couple random rolls, a bunch of sushi, and appetizers.   So the rolls we're just rolls. I'm not really a fan for rolls. The food runner finally gave us sushi and didn't even know what was what.   Food runner: Heres your octopus... Me: Thats not octopus.  Food runner: oh sorry, red snapper.  Me: That's not red snapper.  Food runner: Ohh.... *walks away...   It was actually surf clam. Learn your sea creatures if your going to work at a sushi place!   The sushi was not fresh. All of them were small and slightly fishy. The uni was literally orange brown and tasted so weird I couldn't eat it.   I think then only thing I enjoyed was the miso soup.   Service needs to be a lot better too. I know now the only reason why we waited a hour was because they took forever to clean the tables around us!"}
{"text":"Rice is dry af.   The fish itself taste good but the rice is terrible. It's dry and grainy. I had to keep drinking water as I ate because their sushi would make my mouth dry and the rice would stick. The fish and rice ratio was way off. The fish is cut thin with a thick compressed dry rice underneath. All I eat is nigiri so it's sad that I didn't reorder nigiri for my second round.   The options here are a little limited compared to other AYCE sushi spots.   The inside is very clean and spacey which I really liked. The service was great. They were fast and always came by to ask if we wanted to order more.   Maybe I came on a off day but I didn't like this second visit here!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, good atmosphere, great service - all quality stuff here at Oyshi Sushi.  And of course the name's rather amusing.  The sushi chef that helped us at the bar was very friendly and conversational.  Since we're new to Vegas, he even suggested some good places to go check out for recreational purposes.  We'd recommend this restaurant and will likely return, but will probably check out other places in town (since there are soooooo many options).  If you're nearby, I'd definitely say it's worth the stop.  Here's the rundown on food:  Things we tried that I'd recommend: Rattlesnake Roll - good stuff, great combo of flavors Oyshi Roll - the signature roll lives up to it's role - a must-have Gyoza - order it pan-friend (even though they only list deep fried & steamed) Chung Hua - Probably my favorite roll of the night Nuclear Bomb - chef made this when we requested one of his choices - not for the weak tongued.  This one's very spicy and tasty! Yellowstone - really great baked roll Ahi Poke Salad - I really enjoyed this - well rounded flavor, fresh and tasty - wife thought it was too seaweed-y Shrimp Tempura - the kiddo loves this stuff  Items you could skip: Baked Mussels - rather bland, prefer 'em creamier and with more zip Calamari - very basic, dipping sauces are okay, nothing special, needed salt Heart Attack - it's good, but have the Nuclear Bomb instead Treasure - wife said she liked it, I didn't think it really stood out much;"}
{"text":"The all you can eat meal is by far my favorite in town, and there are a plethora of non seafood items included that appease many different tastes. Service is almost always swift and affable.  They should consider improving their wait time estimates for accuracy so guests can make informed decisions, expand for surplus business, or allow small parties to makes reservations. I waited over 1.5 hours after being quoted 45 min on a Friday evening, as I watched many parties that arrived after me get seated first. This only happened twice out of many visits, so it is a forgivable offense."}
{"text":"This place is so good, the chefs really took care of us and the food was fresh and delish."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers!  This place is great.  Nice clean interior (they actually have a VIP room, guess that's a normal thing in Vegas to have everywhere though, eh?), friendly staff and an amazing deal for all-you-can-eat (AYCE) sushi.    They do AYCE where you actually just order whatever you want off the regular menu and they make and deliver it to you.  My friends Andrea, Annie and James all chowed and put away an impressive amount of sushi.  Since Annie and Andrea are bodybuilders they usually can't get full but we were all about to burst as we waddled out of Oyshi.  The nigiri are pretty decently sized and the fish is quite good.  As far as AYCE, it's the best fish I've had.  They have a ton of crazy rolls and while I am not usually a roll guy for AYCE it's fun to try out so many options.  We went for lunch and it was $21 which we definitely got our money's worth.  It's also nice to get away from the Strip as we are here covering a bodybuilding show and the pace is less flashy and frenetic which is great.  Definitely make it out to Oyshi!"}
{"text":"Originally this place could not figure out a system to seat guests in the correct order of arrival and it would drive me crazy. As of lately, this problem seems to be fixed.   Their appetizer menu is extensive and the main reason why we have AYCE. Their rolls are nothing special and their is limitation on dessert, but still not a bad deal. The restaurant is spacious and even when full, still feels fine."}
{"text":"When we're on West Sahara side, this place hands down gives you a reason NOT to think so hard about where you wanna have a chill but amazing dinner.  The sushi is fresh every single time and the appetizers are in good portions if you're doing AYCE. The sushi chefs are all great, but if you ever want that extra special, catch Nacho& carlos. Nacho especially.  All the waiters and waitresses are accomodating as well, BUT if you ever get the chance ask for RYAN. Funny.as.hell. great host and an asset to oyshi.   Oyishi on rainbow is good,l but if you want an overall great time-- sahara location is where it's at."}
{"text":"I ordered ToGo & I just wasn't very impressed. I'm paying the same price as if I was dining in but I felt that I wasn't getting the same quality. The sushi roll looked sloppy & didn't stay together. There wasn't much fish on the roll either. My other roll had no sauce so it tasted very bland. It was not worth the $13/roll. I've eaten here before but dined in & it was very good but I wouldn't recommend getting their food Togo or for delivery."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite AYCE sushi restaurant on the face of this planet,  and I don't even live in Las Vegas.  It's a really fun place to take your friends.. I introduced a group of my gal pals to Oyshi last December when we all came to town for my 21st birthday, and now they won't stop asking me when we'll be coming back!  (+ For sure, you'll need to try to Love Fair or Lobster Fair, those are our favorite rolls.)"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and it was pretty good. The quality of the sushi was good but not the best. The only complain is that they put a lot of rice in their sushi pieces. I think they do that so you fill up more and not over order on their all you can eat. The restaurant is nice and clean.  Good vibes."}
{"text":"I've had sushi from Japan and this is by far no where near the real deal. Blue fin is some what closer to what you could expect in a sushi restaurant in Japan."}
{"text":"You get a lot but that isn't always a good thing."}
{"text":"If I had the option of giving no stars, I would. Hands-down, worst service I've ever had. We walked in and stood in front of the hostesses for at least a good 90 seconds (90 seconds too long) before we even got EYE CONTACT. They were too busy chatting amongst themselves. Then, they didn't even ask us how we were doing. We sat down and ordered - the waitress had absolutely no knowledge of the menu - huge red flag (even your staff doesn't want to eat here?). We then noticed one of our plates was dirty and had old food on it, so of course we asked for another. They took the plate back and came back with a \"new one\"... which we could clearly tell was just the old one wiped off with a rag. After that, we couldn't stay in that place one more second. Bottom line: I wouldn't send my WORST ENEMY to this restaurant. You can have the best food/product in the world but if you have terrible service, your business will STILL fail. It's a good thing there are plenty of other amazing sushi places here in Vegas - this one will not last long among them."}
{"text":"5 stars for the interior decorations.  This place is very upscale and the ambiance is nice, great vibe for a date night.  2 stars for fish quality.  I ordered a few different nigiri: salmon, halibut, red snapper, yellowtail, and scallops.  First of all, the fish to rice ratio was 1:1.5.  I am not sure how most people like their sushi, but I tend to I like my sushi a little more meaty and less rice-y.  Everyone has their own opinion on this, which I understand.  The salmon was alright, but I didn't get the \"melt-in-your-mouth\" sensation.  I'm not sure if I came on an \"off\" night, or if the fish just wasn't fresh this time.  I guess I expected more for a nice-looking restaurant, but I will definitely try it again next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  Honestly, this is either my new favorite sushi place or close to it.  I ate so much and still wanted more!  The rolls were tasty and never before have I seen so many appetizers that were included with the AYCE option!  The restaurant is inviting, the food is delicious, the options are almost endless, the service is quality, and as an added bonus, there were a ton of good looking women who dined here while I was present (nothing to do with the restaurant but definitely a plus).  As soon as I left I wanted to go back.  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it wasn't perfect.  Some of the food was just ok and not amazing like the rest.  Items such as the egg rolls, surf and turf plate, and shrimp and asparagus skewers were just alright, nothing to write home about.  That being said, I would instantly come back here."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, all you can eat for about $30, clean and awesome restaurant aesthetics, and private rooms. Will definitely be going back regularly."}
{"text":"Got EXTREMELY HORRIBLE food poisoning here as well did my bf. The service was nothing great especially seeings how when we told our waitress about the roll tasting funny she didn't even notify a manager. I will NEVER eat here again as long as I live!! After my experience I had multiple friends tell me the same thing had happened to them as well as the people in their parties!!! Obviously food is being kept wrong at this place for multiple people to have food poisoning!! I never have written a yelp review but this experience has pushed me beyond belief with the way It was handled. When I called to tell them something was wrong they might want to not serve that roll and its ingredients I was told a manager would call me back I then called the next night and said I wanted my money back I was heated from no manager contacting me which by the way the money was taken out of my account and not refunded. The girl on the phone went back and forth with the manager it pisses me off you're a manager GET ON THE PHONE AND HANDLE THE SITUATION!!!!! I shouldn't have to demand to speak to a manger!! Food poisoning isn't to be taken lightly and I absolutely feel like they don't care. Please be careful eating here it's not worth getting sick! I only put ONE star because you clearly can't post a review unless you give at least one star."}
{"text":"This place has definitely won it's spot as a routinely vegas visit along with earl sandwiches!   definitely one of the best ayce sushi spots i've ever encountered! Its a bit off the vegas strip about 15 mins but it's well worth it! The fish are so fresh and melts in your mouth like buttttttttter! Rice to fish ratio is 1:2...very minimal rice which is pretty rare and unheard of from any ayce sushi joints.  cant wait for my next vegas trip =)"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place. So many good options to pick from. I can eat edamame all day. You also get dessert afterwards. Parking is good. Price is decent for all the sushi you can get. I always look forward to coming here. I anticipate it all day. My favorite is the spider hand rolls without crab meat. The staff has always been friendly. Definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I would've given this place 5 stars, had I reviewed it the first time I ate there. I don't quite remember what I had the first time coming into this restaurant, but I do remember having their blueberry parfait, and that alone deserved 5 stars! My second visit to Oyshi was for dinner, and I ordered the Ahi poki salad, the Love Affair sushi roll, and a parfait of course! The salad and the sushi roll were excellent, the best part was probably the Love Affair sushi roll.. probably the best roll I had in a while, from what I remember, it had lobster and crab meat, it was awesome! So here it goes, if so excellent, why the 4 stars you ask..   Well.. the parfait. It was so much bigger and tastier the first time around.. from what I recall, it was served in a taller glass the last time, more ice cream and more toppings.. This time, it was skimped down to a smaller glass, and yes, smaller glass means smaller parfait. It also lacked the toppings I once remembered it had. Therefore, I conclude this review by saying Oyshi is an awesome restaurant, but they need to overcome this economic slump by serving MORE not less! =)"}
{"text":"Came here last week with a friend and came to the bar wed night. Chef Ed was the one serving us food. He was entertianing us and gave a bunch of his specials. It was soo good, you have to try the salmon belly he prepares, its the BOMB!! Every time we come here he always surprises me and my friends. Recommend Chef Ed!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is the reason I probably won't return. I'll admit the food is awesome and the selection is extensive when you order ayce. I gave this place three strikes before I decided I won't come here again. The first time I came with a group of 4 friends. Waitresses were always slow to come to our table to order more sushi leaving us with nothing to eat multiple times. At the end of the day two of us got food poisoning the next day. Second time I came with my girlfriend. Again, waitresses don't check up on our table enough. Third time I came with a group of 8 friends. We waited over 30 minutes for our server to take our second order for ayce. We complained to the manager about our server and it seemed like he didn't care or address our concern. When our server did come we already lost our appetite and just wanted to leave. The food is amazing but the service needs an overhaul.  I'll be return every once in awhile but, previous experiences has kept Oyshi from being my #1 AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Best sushi in all of Las Vegas. I highly recommend sitting at the bar for AYCE because the service is better. We come come every other week"}
{"text":"For the past several trips to Vegas, Oyshi has been our first stop we make before heading in to strip to check in to our hotel. We always order the all you can eat sushi. Our usual dishes are the raw Oysters, Ikura, Uni, Ono, Scallop, Yellowtail, Salmon, Softshell Crab... But they ran out if uni the last time we were there, so if you want uni, go there early if you can.  Everything is always fresh and service is great, even on a busy night! There could be a wait on the weekends, but it's totally worth the wait! Some say that the AYCE price is a little high, but if you could see how much we eat, you can say that we definitely ate more than our money's worth!!!"}
{"text":"Best and my new fave AYCE place ;) get Daniel as your sushi chef. He was pleased to teach me about and sample some live and obviously raw \"horse clam\" or geoduck and asked if it was ok to use fresh wasabi. Are you kidding!? Ummm, yes please! He also topped the scallops with wasabi tobiko which was a nice surprise :)"}
{"text":"The all you can eat is very well priced. I got a hand roll and one specialty roll and my bill was 21 bucks so for 6 more dollars I could have stuffed myself. Spicy tuna and avocado can be hit or miss two days ago it was perfect and beautiful. Today the spicy tuna was ridiculously hot and the avocado was brown. The specialty rolls are definitely not the combinations that I typically prefer. (But they do allow custom orders with AYCE). Kinda like they are trying to hard to be different. The baked mussels are the business. The mojito was awful. This was close to home we will be back to try more stuff."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi spot in Vegas! I've been coming here for over 9 years and it never disappoints. Tonight we had an awesome server (EJ) and I thought he deserved a special Yelp shout out. If you want quality sushi and great service Oyshi is your spot!"}
{"text":"Horrible server messing up our orders.. its AYCE lunch and good thing we were not in a hurry.  It took 25 mins to get one order of roll. We were the first ones there and the last one to get our order. It took 46 mins to get an order of sashimi. Some of our orders didnt come out. I dont think I will go back again. There's a lot more places to go for Sushi. The food wasnt that good anyway."}
{"text":"All I gotta say CHI is the shiz net when it comes to his creations and sushi.  AYCE sushi is so bomb there.  Best appetizers in town, went to plenty of sushi joints, by far oyishi our #1 spot."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of sushi and this is my favorite place in Las Vegas. Very spacious and pleasant to enjoy your lunch or dinner. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Love the surf and turf her. Call ahead for a table cause its always packed."}
{"text":"Just steps away from my home. My favourite place to have a quick dinner. Lover their Unagidon and Sashimi&Tempura the most."}
{"text":"More like three and a half, but I'll be nice. Got here on a Friday night, no reservation. It was super busy, we waited about 25 minutes. We didn't mind the wait, we were pretty excited to try somewhere new. Our waiter immediately took our drink orders, and then asked if we'd like to order. All three of us got all you can eat, so we could try a bunch of stuff together. We got edemame, chicken yakitori, muscles, raw oysters, gyoza, yellowtail nigiri, miso soup, and a few rolls. The raw oysters were outstanding. Soooo fresh and good! The chicken was tasty, the muscles were fresh and not too much sauce,  the edemame was steamed perfectly. The nigiri was a little different, but tasted okay. The tiger roll and the screaming roll were only okay. An OVERLOAD of rice, it was almost astonishing. Like holy shit, that's a lot of rice, bro. The hawiaan and whatever rolls my friend got were pretty tasty. Overall, it's worth it just for the appetizers. I'll come back to try different rolls  By the way, when my friend got a refill on her sprite, he came back and she said that the syrup was all out, it just tasted like soda water. He was confused. Did she want another one? Uhm. Yeah. So he went into the kitchen, literally stood there for a few seconds, and came back and gave her the SAME glass. Oh boy.  Other than that weird mishap, service was pretty good."}
{"text":"I went to their other locations a few weeks ago, so I decided to go to this one with my mom yesterday.  We walked in, and the host just kind of looked at us. He said hi, and just kind of looked away awkwardly. My mom said she wanted to sit at the sushi bar, so he led us over there and took out drink orders and said he'd be right back. We got our drinks, then the wait came. The sushi chefs literally didn't acknowledge us one time. It look maybe 20-25 minutes for the waiter to come back. Another 25 to get any of our food, then it all came out very slow. We were there for like over two hours. They kept walking past us, taking orders from other people, and serving them first without even asking us if we wanted more. Uh. Okay.  The food, however, still awesome. Muscles and oysters are sooo good, the miso pork belly, nigiri, heart attack and the \"my favorite\" rolls were sooo good, plus the always delish rainbow roll. The Chung hua was pretty good, but the other one we got was kinda weird and bland.   Basically, 4 for food, 2 for service. I'll go back though. Every place needs a second chance."}
{"text":"The All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi and appetizers is a great deal, if you're hungry and you don't want sashimi (which isn't included).  Food is good."}
{"text":"Eh... that's how I feel about this place.  I will defo give this place a 4.5 star on the decor, the styling of their menu and placemats. BUT a 2 star on their food.   When I get sushi, I rarely get anything baked. Which makes sense if you're doing AYCE. You don't want to get filled up quick. I had the AYCE but I was craving for nigiris. Got my usual salmon, tuna, albacore, yellow tail and cajun albacore. OMG, I tried picking up the nigiri, and rice literally just fell out. and the fish was too thick and kinda rubbery. Yuck.  Service was alright, the waiter checked on us couple times like how they should. I was told that their service was the worst, but in this case, it's the fish.   I would come back, actually I wouldn't. Wait, I would if I got appetizers only not nigiris."}
{"text":"Food is not fresh.....my family and I got food poisoning after our 11/20/11,visited. We went in around 9:45pm  not many customer besides few people sitting at the sushi bar. employees were talking and hanging out by the enterance. Took them 20 mins to bring water and coke, by the way, never get the refill within 1 1/2 hour stayed. The worst dishes was the one I ordered \"gyo don\" it supposed to come with really thin and tender beef with stir fried onion and half cooked sukiyaki soup based eggs. But disapointedly I recieved a mexivan style beef bawl. lots of green paper and sunny side up egg. Nothing like gyo don.  Sushi was okay, until we got home, all 4 of us start feeling the stomach pain.went into quick care the next following day.  One last thing to mntion is the lady waitress, she was really not professional. We asked her to clean up our dishes before the cakes come, she picked up 2 dishes then never come back. We have to ask anoyher waiter to clean up the rest of empty dishes.  We live across st from thos restaurant, but we will nevrer come back again."}
{"text":"Ted, many of the girls in our group are in love with you. From your sweet smile to your jovial manner in serving a party of 15.  My friend had her birthday dinner here and we could not have asked for a better waiter than Ted. He was so attentive, happy, and energetic, especially with a mess of us indecisive girls and boys.  All you can eat sushi for $26! I ordered a la carte, but a majority of everyone did the AYCE. It is a great deal and usually, when you get such a good deal, you tend to sacrifice quality, but everything was really good. Fresh, amazing, whatever adjective you would like to use.  I really wish I could bring this place back home.  OYSHI ME!  P.S. My friend thought this place was near the strip, it was HELLA far away, so in case you plan to go, grab a lot of people and hop in a limo. It's the best way to do it."}
{"text":"Oyshi is like one of those Simple Pleasures in life but still has the Finesse and class of an international cruise boat sailing foreign Seas and sharing with you nautical Delicacies.  The second time I've been here and it's just as good as I remembered if not better the staff and chefs do an amazing job and a really great and attentive and ready to listen can even get fresh wasabi the desert to delicious and you really can't go wrong with just about anything on the menu if you've never been here before then I highly suggest it to anyone and everyone plus they have happy hour."}
{"text":"I don't understand how busy this place is. We ordered 7 rolls and they all taste the same. Baked and fried ones taste really bad. I'm sorry"}
{"text":"What a great meal!  You can opt for all you can eat for $26 or order a la carte.  $26 for all you can eat sushi is an amazing price!  The only thing you can't order is from the sashimi menu and your limited to 1 dessert item.  The menu is abundant and creative.   We ordered...  Appetizers Oysters - so fresh and delicious! Tuna Poke - mixed with seaweed salad and oh so good. Sirloin steak teryaki - sizzling right off the hot plate, very tender. Sushi rolls Losbter Fair - scrumptious! My Favorite - scallops, variety of fish, topped in eel sauce. Yellowtail trio - fresh hamachi mixed with a ginger sauce. Dessert Green tea terimisu - to die for!  It's made with marscapone cheese, it's smooth consistency just melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Food is good! Servers are slow and rode  Looking at the table but never ask if everything is ok."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The fish is fresh and the service is great. I came for lunch and ordered all you can eat. Normally when I go out to eat sushi the all you can eat has a very limited menu. At Oyshi, the entire menu is all you can eat with the exception of sashimi. All you can eat is only 21$ for lunch and I left with a very full belly. I will deffinetly come back with friends!"}
{"text":"FOOD: 2/5 I wouldn't call myself a sushi extraordinaire, but I do think that I have been to quite a few sushi spots and have a holistic view of what I do and do not like. I think that this location's sushi just didn't hit the target. The baked sushi came out cold (will elaborate on this in the section below), and they were nearly always DRENCHED (not an over-exaggeration) in sauce. I did, however, rather enjoy the sashimi, but that is because it came out plain and simple.   I ordered the following on my last visit: Kimono roll, Japanese Lasagna, Shrimp Tempura, Baked Tuna, and Tuna Sashimi. We didn't do AYCE because my stomach can't handle that much food. Anyway, the Kimono roll was pretty good--instead of nori, it was wrapped in soy rice paper, so I was digging the difference. However, when I picked it up a piece with my chopsticks, the whole thing fell apart. For $12 for five or six pieces, I was not impressed. I think this happened with nearly all of the rolls I ordered EXCEPT for the Shrimp Tempura roll. The Japanese Lasagna was drenched in sauce and topped with creamed cheese. It was cold and the flavor was too rich and too heavy. I couldn't even taste any of the other elements of it because it was overpowered by unagi sauce and cream cheese. The Baked Tuna came with poor presentation--already coming apart before any of us even attempted to grab a piece. It was cold and had too much unagi sauce. Like I said, the tuna sashimi was pretty good. Not as fresh as other places that I have been to, but it did the job.   SERVICE: 2.5/5 I am not sure why it took so long to get my food. Each roll came out one at a time with nearly five minutes between each. By the time our last roll came, we didn't want to eat anymore. Additionally, people around us who ordered similar rolls (baked, fried, etc.) got their food very quickly. When the food came out it was room temperature or cold when it was supposed to be baked. Our whole dining experience lasted nearly 2 hours because of the delay. We were never apologized to; it nearly seemed like a norm for food to come out to the tables that slowly. I had to check on each (again--not an over-exaggeration) roll to see when and if they were coming out. I would like to say, though, the server did refill my water quite a few times.   AMBIANCE: 3/5 The music was pretty loud in this place, which didn't really appeal to me. It kind of made me have an aversion to my meal and a bit of a headache. I think that is what they were going for though: a modern feel for younger folk. I appreciated the attempt. The decor was pretty nice though. I also enjoyed the wall designs.   PRICE: 2.5/5 I have to say that I am not very happy to have spent $55 for sushi that I didn't quite enjoy. The food was rather high-priced for the quality of service and food offered. I would say that compared to their competition, Oyshi is priced rather high. I am all for paying a pretty penny for pretty sushi, but I wouldn't categorize this place's sushi as such.  LOCATION: 4/5 The location is easy to find. There is ample parking here, too."}
{"text":"Great sushi for the money! Will recommend to a friend. I am a fan, as the stars say ;)  Yay!"}
{"text":"hands down. this is by far the best sushi place in all of vegas. i havent been to all, but  ive been to many sushi spots. ive explored what every sushi place i've been to has to offer as their signature rolls. but ive gotta say, Oyshi's all you can eat, is worthy of my twenty something dollars. reborn and raised on the turfs of this restaurant. speaking of,  surf & turf on a sizzling platter!? part of the all you can eat menu. come on. get real. they are. their \"love affair\" is part of my oyshi diet. its busy at night, you may have to wait. worth the wait. they even have 3 private rooms available to reserve if you're having a big group or a special occassion. good times every single visit. i have no complaints. if i had any complaints. its far from my house. but really worth the drive. it makes me appreciate them even more."}
{"text":"Was here two weeks ago.  Food was so good we came back again.  Especially liked a special role made by Daniel.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Not the place for freshest or highest quality sushi in the city, but this place FOR SURE wins on value and convenience. I've never sat down to eat here, but I've lost count on how many times I've ordered take out. Keep in mind though the place is quite small, but they seem to have had a lot of famous people (especially sports guys) walk through their doors. Their takeout platters come with a ton of food, big slices of sashimi and the rolls are well sized too. They're open quite late every day so if you're looking for sushi after all the other places have closed, this place is a must! Also, for the people who live in the condos nearby, they do delivery!   I'm giving this a 4/5 because of its value and convenience, but the food deserves more of a mediocre rating. Without a doubt, it's still really good!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, but the service was really slow. We were barely checked on, no drink refills, and empty plates were left on the table for a while. Service has gone down since the last time I was here but hopefully it changes soon. Other than the service, the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"I decided to eat here with the family because of a friend's recommendation. All their nigiri items look and tasted fresh. My brother and I usually get the Uni to further test their seafood quality. We even tried their oysters (we usually don't) and they are very good as well. They also have an extensive menu and even offer uncommon items like Natt? (fermented soybeans). The service was excellent; i think this was partly because they thought we were new to AYCE dining. Overall a solid sushi spot for AYCE."}
{"text":"Celebrated a birthday here the other night.  The AYCE is a definite plus especially since we are all sushi lovers. We visit this place a lot since its close to our house. We had made a reservation since we were a large party, so we were sat right away even though there were people waiting outside.  Sushi was pretty good, no complaints. Definitely love the yellowtail with ponzi, garlic tuna and uni. Tried the tiger roll this trip and loved it.   The service was the only pitfall. Like I said we have been here quite a few times and the service was never amongst the best but this night was especially unfortunate. The service was extremly slow, it took about 30 minutes to get our second round of sushi and we had to keep asking our runner/busser to find our server.  The server was super nice and polite but i think they were just understaffed and not prepared for how busy the restaurant was that night."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Its delicious and the staff are not only sweet and kind they are very very attentive to anything you need!  I already went twice in a row last week and i cant wait for more! do the all you can eat sushi!  My favorite roll ever is the DOUBLE SCREAMING ROLL with cucumber squeeze some lemons on top of it and it tastes even better~!! YUUM  You also MUST TRY my second favorite its a tad spicy but is so good...Lava Flow &  as for plates the sizzling steak plate is delicious."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Saturday- they open AT 11:30, not one second before- we were shoo'ed back when we tried to have a seat at the bar 3 minutes beforehand. AYCE, but sitting at the sushi bar we were not allowed to order from the sushi chef, the waitress would take the order, then reach in front of us and hand the slip to the chef.  Sushi was okay, but I won't be back.  The waitress was condescending in attitude, not sure what they were going for-"}
{"text":"So happy to write a review about this place. The All You Can Eat sushi is well worth it! A group of five ate 11 rolls and plenty of appetizers! We all had a great time trying new rolls. Our waiter Kevin was a great help when choosing from the extensive menu. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to bring family or friends from out of town .. All you can eat appetizers as well as sushi ..!!"}
{"text":"If you want to receive any of your rolls in under 20 minutes don't go here. Went on a Tuesday night and it took forever to get even some soup (13 minutes). I didn't know one of the rolls had mushrooms in it which I'm allergic to, and instead of being more considerate the waitress argued with me and said I should have read a different part of the menu where it have the description. I didn't know the roll was In the menu in two different places so I was a little upset. She ended up charging us for two all you can eats even though I only got miso soup because when I got the roll and took a bite I got sick. So I really paid 27$ for miso soup. She could have had the courtesy to charge him for his all you can eat and me for just my soup.   Won't be coming here again. Rude server and roll took 20 minutes to get to me anyways."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi location on the west side! Open late and always very kind service. Never a bad experience with our food selections. All you can eat sushi menu has a great selection."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of sushi.  We were apartment hunting and one of the leasing agents told us about Oyshi Sushi.  We were glad we did.  It was a very refreshing change from our normal haunting place here in Silverado Ranch.  Oyshi is very nice.  Most of their patrons are young adults and they have pop music in the background.  We really liked the ambiance of the restaurant.  The best part was the food, for an AYCE dinner, it is somewhat on the pricey side but we wanted to try their extensive sushis.  They have hand rolls, cut sushi, baked, deep fried, fusion, vegetarian, specialty, and sashimi (this isn't included in the AYCE price though).  You can also have some appetizers and various salads, rice bowls, and dessert with the AYCE price.  For the two of us with regular drinks, we spent $61 ($71 with tip), so as you can see, it can get pricey.    Now, for the review of the food.  We ordered AYCE and we ate our fill of sushi.  My order: 1) Deep fried Philly - loved it!  It was cooked well and not dried up.  The sauce on it is enough that it doesn't require soy sauce to enjoy. 2) Rainbow Roll - so fresh and tasty. 3) Tiger Roll - it was so beautiful and enjoyed it immensely. 4)  Double Salmon - I enjoy salmon so this was a no brainer.  My partner: 1)  Supreme Vegetarian -  he liked it but it was wrapped in soy paper.  He liked the veggies that were rolled in the \"sushi.\" 2)  Hawaiian Roll - this is a definite thing to order! 3)  California Roll - they were done well as they should be.  It is a staple in any sushi place. 4)  Japanese Lasagna - this one is baked.  He wasn't a fan of cooked sushi.  Then, the heavenly bites of dessert came.  My partner had the Strawberry Mochi and I had the Creme Brule.  I have to say, the Creme Brule was a taste of heaven.  I was so glad we got this for sure.  To end my LONGEST review(so far), this sushi place is definitely a go to place for us.  The ambiance was awesome, the food were tasty, and over all, its a definite place to try out.  Just be sure your wallet can afford the bill."}
{"text":"This place is amazing whenever you go here and order all you can eat tell the waitress to order you her favorite they do amazing job and if you seat on the bar chef ED does amazing rolls that are not in the menu thank you chef ED for the mucho spicy roll !!"}
{"text":"Everything is so fresh here. One of our favorite sushi places in Las Vegas. The service is pretty good, sometimes you'll wait a bit to see your server during times. I would have done 5 stars but they don't offer any military discounts, so 4 stars is still good!"}
{"text":"Say what?! AYCE for $26?! Yes sir it's worth your whole $26, or if you're going for lunch, it's only $21 but you don't get oysters and who doesn't love oysters?! They have a vast selection of sushi rolls, some of my favorites are the Oyshi Roll which is a baked roll with dynamite topping, spicy tuna crunch, and the atomic roll. But the one thing that is worth every penny is their super white tuna. Have you had super white tuna?! No?! Well, get your butt over here and try it! It melts in your mouth like butter, it's the champagne of fish.. Yes, ahh thinking about it just makes my mouth drool, they top it off with ponzu sauce and it couldn't get any better than that.  Their appetizer list is ongoing and you have so many choices, that's what I like about their AYCE, you have many options to choose from. The calamari is nice and crispy on the outside and a little chewy when you bite into it. The surf and turf is awesome and they just have new meats to pick from that come in a griddle plate (is that what it's called?) it comes steaming hot and on a bed of cabbage and onions YUMMMM! They have a good ahi poke bowl that comes with cucumber slices and seaweed salad underneath, amazing. I could go on, but you really just have to get your butt over there and try it for yourself! Oh yeah, did I mention the desserts? Oh, I haven't.. Well I love their vanilla parfait! They also have creme brûlée, green tea tiramisu, and green tea and vanilla ice cream. Oh goodness, I'm hungry."}
{"text":"OYSHI - I LOOOOOVEEEEE YOU.  HAHAHA.  No joke, the Love Affair roll = Delicious, Tiger Roll = super delicious..... nice selection of rolls and such ...   everytime I go there my server has been awesome...  all you can eat Sushi... sad that you cant have the Sashimi all you can eat... but still for the $26 all you can eat price point... I am by no means disappointed by it... if they wanted to throw some in though, I would welcome it with open arms...."}
{"text":"Very nice place and nicely decorated.  Service is fantastic. They are on point and very accommodating.  I wish I could say the same about the sushi. We had the AYCE, and the rolls were just mediocre.  They need to improve on the rice and the quality of the fish on the nigiri was lets just say doesn't look fresh.  I would go here again, but for their lunch special."}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be. But it's still so busy..! They always seem to run out of uni which is my favorite thing.  Limit one dessert with the AYCE. And my dessert of choice is the green tea tiramisu. Yum! Though the parfait is a close second.  The AYCE price is the same as most places. The items were good, but nothing too special. Service is kinda poor. Maybe because I am usually here with a larger party so we are usually in one of the private rooms. I must say though, the room on the left with the couches is nice, but not ideal for a dining area...  Not a bad sushi place food wise, but service could use improvement. But really nothing special about this place, I don't get why so many people love it here... And I AM a sushi LOVER... well.. a food lover in general. :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is always busy, so calling ahead will help with the long waits. They have a very large selection of sushi on the menu ranging from shashimi to baked rolls.  They have a wide variety of appetizers that come with the \"All you can eat\" menu.  If you like spicy rolls, go with the Nuclear Roll. It was by far my favorite of the night.  The staff was surprisingly on point with being attentive to as well, especially since it was a full house."}
{"text":"Las Vegas  Robbie's place High roller !  Dynamite appetizer Rock and roll (tiff would love this) No oyster appetizer- gross Oysha roll is good but a 2nd dynamite would be better Love affair is good but not amazing Surf and turf appetizer is pretty good. Asparagus and beef is good"}
{"text":"Sushi can be so strange, and so personal, and opinions are like *ssholes - everyone's got one. But this must be said: I love Oyshi Sushi on Sahara.   IF you come here often, you learn the pace and the chefs will learn your taste and it's like chocolate and peanut butter: magic will happen.  If you come here thinking you've got the most sophisticated sushi palate on the planet, take your stuck-up self somewhere else. Because this AYCE is not about how much uni or conch or surf clam you can talk them into giving you. It's about sitting at the sushi bar and biting into creative hand rolls that are handed to you by hand - enjoying the crackle of the toasted nori cone and having a cool time with a team of what are probably the coolest sushi chef personalities in the city. It's about enjoying the game on the generously-sized HDTVs while experiencing awesome service. My water cup / green tea cup is NEVER empty here - that is a rare thing, especially at an AYCE sushi spot!  My favorite kitchen item is their deliciously tender and flavorful 'Asian Skirt Steak' served sizzling on a bed of onions and cabbage (included in AYCE), solid apps and skewers (also included) as well as appealing gyoza (steamed or fried) and other standard \"Midwestern\" Japanese kitchen items are all included.  Not a fan of the species of oysters they serve (and I love oysters) - weird texture - so I just don't order them anymore. There are plenty of other things I like ordering. Fresh scallop sushi (better than Sushi Koma's), the 'Monster' hand roll (soft shell crab, eel, spicy crab, avocado) and a few other secret items that I'm not going to disclose because I don't want them to be out of them the next time I go, which is currently once-a-week whenever possible.  This place is the jam. (Go and discover it for yourself.)"}
{"text":"Enormous amount of various combinations of every kind of roll.   Lively atmosphere.  Friendly staff.  Fair prices with an AYCE choice.  Bar, lounge, and restaurant seating available.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Oyshi used to be my favorite AYCE sushi spot.  They had a wide variety of quality rolls, great tasting food, consistent service, and a really nice atmosphere that made for a great spot to have pre-game Friday night dinner.   Although the sushi is still pretty good, the service and management has gone off the deep end and because of this, I don't think I'll ever eat at Oyshi again.  There are too many quality sushi restaurants in Las Vegas to justify returning to Oyshi where the last few visits, all I seem to get are orders that never show up, drinks that never get filled, waiters that refuse to come to our table or our spot at the bar (even though it's obvious that you've seen me flag you down), and servers/staff that are increasingly bitter and unfriendly.    This stuff matters. Oddly enough, it's also the stuff that is easiest to fix. When you've already got quality menu items, quality sushi chefs, and quality sushi rolls that people rave about - why are you letting your terrible servers and management ruin your restaurant?  If I'm sitting at the sushi bar and I'm trying to order more beer and sake, why are people refusing to help me out? If I want to give you my money in exchange for some-what overpriced alcohol, why does it take more than 20 minutes for someone to take my drink order and then another 20 to bring me a couple of beers and sake? This should never be an issue with a sushi restaurant.  Never. Sure, AYCE places get really busy and I totally understand that. But, if you can't handle the heat - hire more servers.   I shouldn't have to wait more than 45 minutes for my order. And when my order does come out, half of it shouldn't be missing. It also shouldn't take you another 30 minutes to bring out the pieces missing from my order. And you shouldn't have an attitude with customers just because they are asking for the items they originally ordered that are missing because you either forgot to put the orders in or there was a mix up in the kitchen. I am never rude to waiters or management and this last experience at Oyshi was no exception. I was pleasant and more than patient and if I still can't get someone to so much as offer an apology for missing orders/missing drinks and for treating me like I was more of a burden than a customer bringing a lot of business to the establishment, then I will happily take my business elsewhere.   Sorry, Oyshi, it was good while it lasted!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 6 stars if I could.   This is always our go to spot for sushi. The menu has a large selection of sushi that is made to order. So many rolls you have to go multiple times to try them all.  There is also 2 pages of just appetizers that come with the all you can eat.  Theres also an a la carte menu for the not so hungry.  Fish is always fresh!!!!   If you sit at the sushi bar you can order \"half rolls\" which is great for lunch. The chefs are awesome too.  Service is always impeccable. We love Kenny. Hes always attentive and making sure we are happy.   Favorite rolls are the Spicy Tuna Crunch and the Yellowstone."}
{"text":"I've been to Oyshi many times and have never had a bad experience. I would recommend the pink lady and coco for sushi rolls. The atmosphere is contemporary and open.   The price for all you can eat is reasonable. Out of all the AYCE sushi restaurants I travel to Oyshi even with closer alternatives."}
{"text":"This sushi place is my favorite! This is the newer location they have opened. It's clean, beautifully designed and decorated, and our server Kenny was amazing! Very attentive and polite. The food and drinks were also great! They didn't have a whiskey sour on the drink menu, but the bartender was kind enough to make it for me anyways! :) All in all recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Oyshi Sushi place that I pass by few times and believe might have gone long time ago. Unfortunately nothing really stood out for me or remember wow factor so took longer time too come back. Nowadays in Vegas AYCE sushi is so competitive and dime dozen that it really hard too stand out unless really good. My opinion the sushi is good but not great or definitely no Wow factor for me. The menu has a nice diversity too it between the appetizers (oyster on the half shell by far my favorite), nigiri, and speciality rolls (i had some kind of spicy tuna roll; sorry forget the name but was really good)  too choose from sure find something like. Whenever I go AYCE more all about the nigiri style because feel that the true barometer of quality of the fish. I felt like compare too other places especially my top spot sushi house goyemon not in the same class. The irony was originally went too sushi hour goyemon but the wait was ridiculous. Me and Roy was hunger so decided too check out something new. Thankfully on this night Oyshi Sushi not packed went right in and sat down went sushi crazy!!   The restaurant is lot more open then most AYCE so usually not lot of waiting too sit down. They do have private rooms for big parties. Not sure if charge extra but nice option too know if party of eight or more. The sushi bar is decent size with two too three sushi chefs going at time. Most part even on say that night half packed we were getting our sushi in timely manner. The server was great keep up on everything and even nice enough towards the end we ordered one too many speciality rolls (thanks Roy) she like no worries no forcing not going too charge us for waste! Think that was really cool!   I like that the restaurant is open because you can have conversations without screaming with other person sitting next or across from you. Oyshi Sushi is place that come back too again but with so many other ones and not that high on my list. Not sure when next time will be but if in the area and out of options good choice."}
{"text":"Love their AYCE (All you can eat) menu. The wait may be long but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best sushi joints in Vegas. It's really far from my house, but when I happen to be in the mood to make the drive over the only thing I ever dislike is the bill. Not crazy expensive, just not the cheapest place in town. You get what you pay for in this town, it's worth what they charge on the occasions that I do go."}
{"text":"Used to be okay, not anymore. the amount of rice got so big, so I can't even order a lot of sushi anymore. The rice makes me full :("}
{"text":"Oyshi is pretty tasty. Their nigiri selection was more limited than what I am used to, but the pieces that we did order- the  hamachi (yellowtail) in particular- were good. The fish was fresh and the only items that came across as overly fishy were the oysters. Many of the rolls on the menu had cream cheese in them, and based on the ones our table ordered a lot of them are the same base roll with different sauces. This may or may not bother you depending on your roll preferences.   The nice thing about Oyshi is that their sides as well as one dessert item are included in the AYCE. My hot green tea came in it's own pot, which was also cool. Service was fine, though the servers kept bringing by items that belonged to other tables (not a big deal; just make sure you keep tabs on what you ordered). The only reason I mention this is because Oyshi charges ala carte prices for leftovers like many other AYCE places, so having extra items delivered to your table could be problematic.   AYCE dinner is $28 with an automatic 18% gratuity for parties of 8 or more. I personally won't be adding Oyshi to my sushi rotation, but I would recommend coming here  when you have a larger group due to the bigger capacity of the restaurant compared to other sushi places. They also take reservations."}
{"text":"This place is right next door to my house.  We came here when they first opened up and fell in love with it ever since.  Every dining experience has been excellent - the service is always friendly and attentive and food perfectly cooked/prepared.   We did a few ala cartes but most of the time it's always AYCE, both lunch and dinner.  Heck if they had breakfast I would do that too.    Most sushi places have a few items that are exceptional and a few not so great, but everything here range from good to phenomenal.    Let me talk a bit about their sashimi items.  I love sashimis and this place has some of the best sashimis i've ever eaten.  Their Seared Albacore with crispy onion in ginger sauce is oh so heavenly.  The only  problem is their sashimis are not included with the AYCE menu and that's understandable because the sashimis are pricier.  Another one is the Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce.  OMG this melts in your mouth and it should be called screaming orgasm for your mouth!  amazing stuff!  How about this \"Tuna sashimi with shaved daikon in a chef special sauce\"? Everytime i finish this plate I want to lick the sauce off the plate but there's always people around me.    Now for their rolls.  They make the typical rolls like Rainbow, Dragon, Spider, Dynamite and Catepillar taste amazing.  Flavor explosion with every bite.  They have a few rolls that are wrapped in thin soy paper sheet that are not as filling as the ones with rice.  Some days I do low carb and i would order a bunch of these.  Pink Lady and Oh My Heart are my favorites.  If you like scallop make sure you order the Volcano, baked scallop with yum yum sauce.    Side dishes and appetizers are very small when you order with AYCE and that's a good thing cuz you just want to taste the variety of stuff.  Finish off with some mochi's and you can die happy."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Oh sheet, it's oyshi sushi. Definitely my favorite sushi place in Las Vegas. This is my go to place for sushi with my husband and his co workers  The wait can be long, so get here early. The longest we've ever waited is max 20 mins  AYCE for lunch is 21 and dinner is 26 bucks, not bad. Which includes a large amount of appetizers and desserts  Favorite rolls: spicy tuna crunch, tiger roll, snow mountains.   The desserts are delicious. The biggest hits being green tea mochi ice cream and the green tea tiramisu.    The service is excellent, the rolls take a while to come out but it's worth the wait because you can taste the freshness.   Like all sushi places, they charge you if you waste food. One bite or two isn't a big deal but don't waste an entire roll.  The restaurant looks like a high ended sushi house, that's well decorated. Very clean and open.   Can't wait to take my out of town friends here."}
{"text":"Sorry oyshi sushi on rainbow but it's just me and the Sahara location now. They must be doing really well to open a second location.   This location is huge compared to the other. They have both very distinct styles and decorations that coincide perfectly. In the rainbow oyshi I sometimes feel cloister phobic when I walk in and have to sit in a jamm packed restaurant. But this location is ginormous. Twice as many customers can fit inside and they have quite a few private rooms and areas. Love that there are four tvs. Two at the bar and two at the sushi bar area. The waitress told us they're trying to put up a projection tv on the wall so all customers inside can see a game, show, or whatever. When they're able to do that it'll be even more awesome.   The children's menu is pretty good and if your child wants to do the ayce sushi they can too for a discounted price.   Don't get confused about the menu. It's very different looking and organized differently from the other location. The only thing not included in it is the sashimi, which is the 5th page.   I found that this location has more of a variety of rolls and desserts too. Such as the rainbow one has creme brûlée, but this one has chocolate and green tea creme brûlée. Which I should add that green tea one looks like infant poop, in color and consistency. BUT is absolutely delicious! If baby poop was that delicious I would eat it everyday. Even my husband was a little afraid to eat it, and was pleasantly surprised at how great tasting it was. He thought it tasted like the green tea ice cream just in custard form.   The usual sushi I get. Tiger, spicy tuna crunch, lobster and screaming were just as top notch as they usually are. It came out super fast and fresh. I thought it may have tasted a little fresher.. Which our waitress says she heard a lot but doesn't know how since both locations get their delivers each morning fresh. Must Be in our minds? I also got my usual calamari, grilled asparagus and egg rolls.  Like always I left plump and happy. This will definitely be our new location since it's larger and closer to our house. Go oyshi!"}
{"text":"This place has something for everyone good seating great ambience The food is really good away from the sushi menu this is a great place to take the first time Sushi Eater to experience different flavors and if they still don't like  Sushi there appetizers and side dishes are amazing I recommend the surf and turf and all the desserts are excellent"}
{"text":"AYCE is definitely the way to go. We had a party of five and we placed orders every 5 or so minutes. Had about 40 salmon belly nigiri,  5 plates of rib eye, 8 specialty rolls, oysters, different appetizers, dynamites... wish I can eat there every day haha..  One star taken off because appetizers were not consistent, the same plate can taste different on the next order. Tempura Shrimp was also meh ...overall good meal for the price. Service on the other hand was excellent."}
{"text":"I've been to many sushi places in Vegas and Oyshi by far was the worst.  The all you can eat is for 2 hours which is fine but it took over 20 minutes to get my one simple roll and it wasn't even busy. It also took me getting up and taking my glass to a waitress to refill my glass of water and the sushi was very average, for $27 you can find much better sushi with good service."}
{"text":"Pros: $27 AYCE, fresh fish, dynamite app, big pieces of nigiri, multiple sake options, calamari, extra large selection of appetizers, short wait for food once ordered Cons: Only 5 baked mussels per person, oysters tasted bad, seared tuna was closer to fully cooked than just seared, surf and turf was over cooked, tables who walked in after us were seated before us Overall: The majority of food that we ordered was excellent with a few misses but the large pieces of fish that were fresh and tasty made up for the few bombs. Service was decent, not the quickest or most personable plus I had to ask for the check and plates stayed around longer than I would have preferred. One thing is for sure for me, great food outweighs decent service so we will be back soon, especially since it's 2 miles from my house."}
{"text":"Literally, THE BEST all you can eat sushi. Really nice workers and food is amazing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tried this place since I'm not from Vegas but my boyfriend is , and he said it was a fav . I thought it was unique because I've never had AYCE sushi but coming to this place I thought it was worth . The place was really nice and clean , super spacious with nice decor . The staff was friendly and took their time with us when it came to ordering and making sure we were fine or if we needed stuff . The food was great , though the portions were small . Lots of rice on the rolls though , and they don't have much stuff when it comes to raw fish . Other than that , I thought this place was great and I would definitely come back when I'm in Vegas again !"}
{"text":"minus one....the worst service i ever had!!!never going back.i love oyshi on the south rainbow ,this location sucks...i've waited for the food for over an hour..."}
{"text":"I usually go to the one on rainbow but this one is closer so why not. And it was the same great food, the same wonderful staff. When people who have never tried sushi ask me where to go I always say here, because they never disappoint. This new one has such beautiful decoration and it has such a good vibe."}
{"text":"Let's just all come clean, we all cave to the All-You-Can-Eat Sushi temptress.  And Oyshi has one of the best in town.  The food is phenomenal with awesome custom rolls. The lobster roll is ridiculous!  This is our go-to sushi spot now.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's kind of cold there.  Now that I think of it, every sushi place in town is.  Why is this?  It's not like Japan is in the Arctic or something!? I would give anything to have a sushi joint in a comfortable environment.  However, in the case of Oyshi, the food is good enough to wrap up and brave the winter storm."}
{"text":"We had the green yea cream brûlée, which was very nice! Everything came out at a very nice pace and timing was excellent! Great all you can eat sushi!"}
{"text":"Besides this place being full of snobby ass people who have a stick up their....... u kno where .....the food and service is amaze!!! they had a roll with jalapeno ( what big help huh) but it had cream cheese and something else it was so good!!!...and their frid calamari is the BUSINEESS!!! great servive, amazing food, keep it up yall!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & all his buddies introduced me to this place, and all I can say is amazing!  I love, love, LOVE sushi and this is hands down one of the best places I have ever eaten sushi at. The employees are always super duper nice and accommodating, the food is delicious, and it's in a nice area. We always get the all you can eat, duh!! ;]  I'm from NY so whenever I visit my bf in Vegas, I always come here at least once. Don't forget to order the parfait for dessert!!"}
{"text":"I only went once and I didn't have a great experience.  The food was fine and I enjoyed it, but it was the service that really turned me off.  They never came around, we would wait and wait til someone helped us and even when we got an order in, it took a while.  I'd visit again but it doesn't seem worth it.  Ehh."}
{"text":"Come here for their green tea creme brulee. That is all. No I'm only joking.  In a city where AYCE sushi is plenty of Oyshi does OK. It's in my rotation for when I'm craving AYCE sushi but not in my top favorites I do prefer others a lot more. It's All You Can Eat sushi and you can really eat all you can eat that's at least until they cut you off. It's your typical AYCE sushi, they all are sushi grade and they make your typical sushi dishes everyone is doing. Not many items wowing me but still many items satisfying.  The bad about Oyshi is their spicy tuna, imitation crab usage, and kind of little nigiri and sushi rolls which is fine if you did AYCE cause you can just order more but not cool if you weren't. They have a lot of items you want to order but aren't available with AYCE. They seem to have a lot of rules.  The good about Oyshi is just about everything else. It's a place to go people watch late nights. Did I already mention their green tea crème brulee. I've been there just for it without ordering anything else and when I do AYCE, I'll make sure there's always room for it at the end. They serve some of their entrees on a sizzling hotplate, I do like the steaks and chicken.   They have a lunch special which includes a soup, salad, and your item of choice from various plates, there's a sushi plate, tempera plate, sashimi plate, and sizzle plate. It's not bad if your not wanting AYCE during lunch.  They offer all my favorites that I must have. They have oysters and uni but they're limited. They have shrimp tempera. They have poke, which like everyone else stretched out with other items. They have a good variety of specialty, tempera, baked, and fried rolls.  Don't mine the clubbing music that's usually playing, even during lunch."}
{"text":"one of my favorite sushi places! The all you can eat is at a great price. they have a huge selection and always have great specials! The rolls are unique! The staff is always kind. Thought I do have to agree with previous reviews that the service can be slow - my advice is know what you want and order a lot at once! They will bring it over as its ready. Plus we always sit at the sushi bar so you don't have to wait for a waitress to bring it to you :) There is usually a short wait but I've never waited more than 15minutes even on a Saturday night. ... For the price point, you cannot beat it!! delicious! and the atmosphere is very upbeat!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been to Oyshi Sushi a couple of times and have thought that the food was good. Nothing spectacular. We have always gone if we are craving sushi and they have an AYCE option. We've never had the problem of getting seated right away which other people have mentioned, but I don't blame them because their staff and customer service is plain out horrible.  The first time my girlfriend took my to Oyshi she had an issue with the customer service that the waitress was giving her. She did not clarify the oysters which was a part of the AYCE and after she was very rude. After taking our order we saw her twice and then thereafter other waitresses had to take our order and deliver our food.  Our second time going to Oyshi it was fine. We were seated in a timely manner and received our orders of AYCE sushi without any issues.  The third time we went to Oyshi is WHY IM WRITING THIS REVIEW and have joined YELP and is also why I'm NOT GOING BACK THERE. We were seated in a timely manner and our order was taken in a timely manner as well, but after the waitress (Pinky) took our order of AYCE we never saw her again. That's when everything fell apart. Our food took at least 20 mins to come out and it wasn't even busy. Not only that, we always order baked mussels with our order  and that never came out to the point where we order a second round. We had to call over the host or the manager or whoever the guy that was dressed up with a tie was. When Pinky never came back a young waiter started to follow up on us. This waiter was \"AWESOME!\" NOT!!! The guy would only look at my girlfriend and never acknowledged me at all. I had to flag the guy down to get a refill on my drink because he would just ask my GF and leave. After waiting and losing our appetites we didn't even ask for dessert which is a part of the AYCE. We were so disgusted with the service that we just asked for the bill.  Lastly, THIS IS WHY I GAVE THEM A ONE STAR...  My bill came out to be $61.62 and because of the wait and the horrible customer service I DID NOT TIP THEM. SO TELL ME WHY AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS MY ACCOUNT WAS CHARGED $72?!?!?!?   Those ******** CHARGED MY CARD AN EXTRA $10.38 meaning they tipped themselves and FRAUDULENTLY CHARGED my card EXTRA!!!!  At what point do they think they deserve my $10.38?!?!  Never go to OYSHI SUSHI!!!! EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Kenny Kenny Kenny!! :D   Sushi was great, Kenny was better!  Thank you so much for your amazing customer service and the laughs!   We will defiantly be coming back :D"}
{"text":"Yet another phenomenal dinner at Oyshi. Food, service, atmosphere, everything was great.   Service was attentive, but not overbearing. Never had to wait for a refill, and we were frequently checked in on.   But the real kicker was our sushi chef, Nacho. Friendly, funny and overall just awesome. I'm always impressed when the chef offers to make me their own creation, and his was truly delicious. Not like anything else I've ever had, and so amazingly plated, I almost didn't want to eat the roll.   Plus with their drink specials Mon-Thurs, this place is definitely in my AYCE sushi rotation."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this new sushi restaurant on Sunday for dinner since it was just opened right by our apartment. The sign \"All You Can Eat\" really lured us in. As we walked in, we immediately noticed the decor and thought it was so modern and clean. The place looked very inviting and the hip \"ultra lounge\" type music was cool, too. We sat at the sushi bar and opted for the all you can eat for $26 each. The menu had several good choices and all the food items, excluding sashimi, was included on the all you can eat. The quality and portions were pretty good too. We made sure we got our money's worth..and we did!  And they serve redbean ice cream as one of the dessert options. I would totally recommend this place if you want to try a new sushi restaurant in the Southwest part of Las Vegas. Great date night place, hint..hint to all you guys wanting to impress a girl."}
{"text":"I used to go to Oishi Sushi frequently when I lived nearby. It's a very nice, cozy, somewhat upscale place with class and ambiance. Low noise  & dim lights make it great for dates. Best Red Dragon rolls in town (my personal favorite.)"}
{"text":"I stopped in here alone and sat at the bar when visiting a friend in Las Vegas. Super clean, fresh and delicious sushi with creative rolls and great 2 for 1 deals. Ask for Pedro, Curtis and Mikey and you won't go wrong! I had the Alaska Roll, Ika Nigira and an off the menu spicy tiny halibut roll that they made when I asked for a roll topped with lemon. I'm super picky when it comes to fresh fish as I grew up eating some of the freshest from the California coast and Bodega Bay. Ika especially is hard to find fresh - usually I order it and am disappointed to find it mushy, but not here.  So good!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and I have yet to be impressed.  The Oysters were UNEDIBLE, not fresh at all. And the Sushi in general just didn't seem very fresh either AND they put quite a bit of rice with the nigiri to fill your ass up with THIN ass slices of fish! Second time not impressed, not wasting anymore time, money or calories here.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"The sushi was good and for the all u can eat price and what they include its definetly worth it.  We sat at the sushi bar and interacted with the guys rolling our sushi and had a great experience. We got there before the dinner rush and would definetly recommend getting there before the rush because they fill up quick.  I will definetly be back."}
{"text":"I've been here once since moving to Vegas so far and I LOVED it.  Service was great, menu is HUGE especially for all you can eat (AYCE), and the sushi chefs were very nice and welcoming.  I cannot wait to return here again and eat as much as possible."}
{"text":"Went there for AYCE at 5:30 and it was still happy hour pricing.  Nice fish to rice ratio and excellent service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love the food here no doubt but I wish they learned how to make the sushi faster D; I guess they do that on purpose so we don't eat as much or something but I'll still go back [:"}
{"text":"Wow...I didn't realize that I haven't done a review for one of my favorite AYCE sushi joints.  Anyway...here it is:  Located on the southwest side of town at the corner of Rainbow and Robindale.  Plenty of parking.  Customer service is a bit lacking compared to when they first opened but I'm sure it's cause they always have a full house.  Reasonable price for AYCE at $21.00 for lunch and $26.00 for dinner.  They have a wide range of menu options which includes appetizers, sashimi/sushi, signature rolls, entrees, kids menu, and my favorite...desserts.  They also have food options for vegetarians.    There are private dining areas for a more intimate experience with seating from 5-20+ people.  The smaller private room seats about 5+ people and has couches for seating and a tv, so while you are dining you can chillax, enjoy your food, and be entertained by the tv.  The larger room can seat about 20+ so it's ideal for larger parties but there are no couches, just regular seats, however, there is a tv."}
{"text":"We have always enjoy eating at the Rainbow location but we want to check the new location out.  As it happens, it's better at the Sahara location.  Since we are regulars, Pedro recognized us and has been amazing.  He made 6 different dishes for us tonight.  And they were fabulous.   The wait service needs improving as he kept asking if we were finished and then when he took away our empties, he dump sauce on my coat and purse.  Still we were a fan and will be back very soon.  Like next week."}
{"text":"More like 2.5 stars...  I heard good things about this place so I checked it out finally, but the food was mediocre... Not a fan of the rolls - they were overly flavored and rolled messy.  I wanted to like this place, but there wasn't anything that cried great to me.  The seaweed salad was probably my favorite appetizer...   The place is a quite overpriced for the food.  I didn't feel the fish was fresh and they used a lot of flavoring to cover-up the meh quality of its food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got food poisoning from this place. They took forever to bring out my roll (45 min) and my boyfriend was already done when mine came. Keep in mind I'm vegetarian and I still got food poisoning. I'm pretty sure they let our rolls sit there forever. The service was also awful! The lady didn't even ask us for refill on drinks until we got a check. DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE NOT EVEN MY WORST ENEMY. Avoid hospital visits and costs."}
{"text":"Great place! While visiting my best friend who lives here, she highly recommended doing something off the strip and different. I had never heard of an all you can eat sushi place that wasn't at a disgusting buffet. This place is great because you can order sushi and small apps, including small plates and salads with the all you can eat special. Not only was the food delicious, but the music was just as good! I could have stayed in there all night. Loved it."}
{"text":"I don't eat rolls with that fancy mayonnaise on, just nigiri for me and the sides. I don't usually do all you can eat but this place is almost always fresh. Almost. They get deliveries every other day so that's why I dropped a star, just for the off day here and there."}
{"text":"The food is great! There isn't anything on the menu that I don't like. Great food and great pricing equals an awesome night. I only rated it 4 stars because of the service. I've been there about ten times and only once did I get good service. I'm sure once their staff is a little more experienced I'll change my ratings to a 5."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever today. Have been a customer for 5+ year aince th original location on Rainbow... the waitress forgot our order too many times and than finally no rolls ever came. So i ended over paying for a Chicken teriyaki my kids ate. Definetely coming back. Will try Rainbow. Problem with branching out, service is never the same."}
{"text":"We've been here multiple times, probably 5+ times with good results. My husband and I went yesterday and things just tasted off. I ordered the teriyaki beef roll and wow it was really disgusting but you know if you don't finish it you have to pay for it. I choked down two pieces, it was horribly nasty. Also at the same time I had a baked roll with shrimp w/crab and lobster on top. The crab was super fishy smelling and just didn't taste right. I should have sent it back but our waitress was never at our table. Twice we had to have one of the guys who brings out the food go get her.  I've been in and out of the bathroom since we got back last night and needless to say I think I got food poisoning. After this experience I'll never go back!"}
{"text":"Best sushi for the best price! My recommendation is to get the all you can eat Buffett. My favorite roll are the rattlesnake and my husband's is the hot tamale. Hands down, rattlesnake is the best!   I took off one star because the service is a hit or miss."}
{"text":"Had lunch there toady with my hubby .the sushi rice is leftovers it's undercooked. The service was bad. Waited a long time for order even though there's only 3table customers in  . We like the other location much more."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best sushi places I have ever been. You get a great deal when for the all you can eat. Great service and excellent food. About a 15 minute drive from the strip, but sooooo worth it"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? It was a Tuesday night and the restaurant looked busy. My group of 12 had one of their private rooms. The biggest stink about this experience is the service. They took my drink order 3 times and all I asked was for some water. I asked them to bring out a birthday cake after we were finished eating. One server came in and told me that he would clear out the dirty dishes before coming out with the cake which he didn't do. I had to get up and ask for extra dishes and forks from the hostess desk. They brought out the cake without lighting the candles that were provided and the cake still in the box. The food quality was not very good. The steak teriyaki meat crumbled in my mouth which basically meant that the meat wasn't fresh but frozen. I won't be coming back since there is so many better japanese spots in town."}
{"text":"Sushi is always fresh always good service. Love the vibe this spot has. I love how they're open late."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in town, I have tried many other places and nothing compares to Oyshi!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but after coming here last night I've lost all hope in this place!   I came with a party of 6 all hungry and ready to eat.  I ordered the lobster fair and love affair .. Which I got about 25 mins after I ordered.. Once I got that me and my friend both ordered the surf and turf (which after 40 mins we never got so we just said f**ck it) our waitress was pretty much non existent the only person we saw was Stephen the server who was a complete douche every time we asked him if we could order he gave us the biggest attitude and said what do u want? One of my friends said to him\" well if u don't wanna take our order can u send our waitress\" who came to our table 20 mins later at this point we all order the ayce and only got 2 rolls each after 2 hours of not eating we were fed up ordered dessert that took another 20 mins to come out so after that we asked to talk to manager... Andy came out listened to our spiel and look uninterested and walked away ..not really say shit to us.. So we got out bill they took off ONE ayce and ONE sake without an apology or even an explanation...  Management and staffing need a total re-training you guys are all unfriendly and obviously don't want anyone's business .. We won't be coming back"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi in Vegas for $27?    Skeptical at first, but definitely hit the spot with all the rolls with jalapenos. Average sushi, but even the Professional Fat Kid has been hit hard by the economy.    I'm just glad it wasn't Todai.  Oh...and saw Chandella Powell, UFC ring girl.  Didn't want to pull a tourist moment, so I didn't ask for a picture."}
{"text":"They use old menus, stating party of 8 will be 18% gratuity. In the end they charged us 18% when we were just a party of 5. Not even giving us a notice since they don't update their menus. I wouldn't be as mad if the service was better but they rarely came to check up on us. At the end of the meal and after paying, my first order of dishes were still on the table. No one even bother to come take it away. The service was not even good enough to be 18%, no warning whatsoever at all."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this place for 3 years now. We order about the same thing most of the time. We are big AYCE sushi fanatics. When we first ordered, we already gave them what we usually order all at once. Then, we were questioned if we can finish it. Of course we said yes. Then we gave them our second order which is about less than half of what we first ordered. When they came back with the albacore we ordered, they gave us a regular tuna. We asked a couple times if it was really albacore and they insisted it is. We know how an albacore looks and taste like. It's one of our favorite fish and it's a must have for us. It seems like they are trying to trick customers with a different but similar looking fish or low grade items. We've tried another sushi place that did this kind of deception before but this is a first from this place. We have plenty of good sushi places in our area but we go out of our way to go to this place. We will not be coming back here anymore and so will the rest of our  family. I'm giving it 2 stars because of the promptness of the food."}
{"text":"Good all you can eat sushi. We had a very nice variety of sushi and apps. The nigiri was nice and fresh and oysters were tasty. The rolls were also good, we tried my favorite, monster and yellow tail trio. We also ordered the miso soup, beef roll teriyaki and shrimp tempura. For dessert we tried the green tea cake tiramisu, berry parfait, mango mochi and some green tea and vanilla ice cream. Worth the wait and filling."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and consistently had a great experience.. up until the past few months. The service and food was always up to par, even during busy times which is most of the time. The All You Can Eat lunch and dinner specials are a nice deal and include appetizers, plenty of sushi options, and absolutely delicious desserts! The only problem I've had is with pretty bad service... or rather disappointingly horrible service. Where you're sitting wondering if your server is intentionally ignoring your empty table. Especially my last visit when I invited my family that was visiting from out of state, our server seemed incredibly distracted and had to be asked multiple times where our food was after waiting 30+ minutes in between rolls and seemingly every roll we ordered mysteriously never made it to the chefs. We ended up being in the restaurant for almost THREE HOURS. Not where I want to spend so much of my night.. I hope management can reinforce the importance of prompt/positive customer service and maybe we'll make this our regular sushi spot again. Maybe."}
{"text":"I just realized that I have not yet written a review for my favorite sushi spot on earth! Here it goes!! Although I have not been here in months because I moved on the opposite end of Vegas, now turning into a 30 minute drive, compared to a 5 minute drive =(  WHERE: Located on Rainbow & Robindale  WHAT:  Everything about this local sushi joint is outstanding! From the uniqueness of the special rolls to the to the great customer service, this is the place to try!  If you do get the chance to come here for your first, second, or millionth time, I suggest AYCE all the way!! Lunch is 24.95 and dinner is 27.95- so worth the time and money spent!  One of my favorite appetizers is the ahi poke! There's something about the mixture that makes you want to order 5 of them and make your own dish!  ROLLS: -Oyshi roll: The first thing you should try! It is their special roll, and the absolute best!! -Vegas & Sibuya rolls: If I can recall, these are the 2 rolls without rice! & are both full of flavor! -Japanese Lasagna roll: I always have to have my baked roll!!  There are other great rolls, but I can't remember what the names were! So, until next time! I will update soon!  *NOTE: You also get a free dessert with AYCE!! There are the fruit&yogurt parfait, creme brulee, ice cream, or mochi!"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time here and it still is a 2.5 star, 3 star at best. Service is terrible, food is either sweet or salty. I was hoping it would improve. Its consistently bad."}
{"text":"I have been here several times hands down best sushi joint in Las Vegas. Always clean & efficient with great food and service not to mention amazing happy hour specials. Don't forget dessert because the green tea ice cream is the perfect way to end the night. Also all you can eat"}
{"text":"One of our favorite sushi places in town. Reasonable priced all you can eat and sushi chefs are always super friendly! We love the upbeat atmosphere and music! We will keep going back for more!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent sushi and the ayce menu is very extensive. It's priced about what all other sushi restaurants charge so that is fine. It's also pretty big and open which is nice because you don't feel too packed in.   I really enjoy all their different rolls but my favorites are the Rock n Roll and the crunchy scallop roll. The scallop roll has these little popcorn scallop pieces that are just so tasty.   For dessert I always get the creme brûlée. If you get ayce, you only get one, but if you order a la carte the creme brûlée is served with three flavors (vanilla, green tea, and chocolate) but the vanilla is the best.   The downside to this restaurant is the wait to get seated which can sometimes be a good hour or more because it's popular. The second downside is the service. Sometimes they are pretty unattentive due to the fact that they are so busy."}
{"text":"We arrived before the crowd and had a wonderful experience.  As we were leaving, the place was filling up and service was starting to slow down so i would suggest that the ideal time for eating at Oyshi is not during the rush.  The sushi was good, the price was good and at the time we went, service was very good!  Update: We've returned several more times and the food is consistently good but the service has been hit or miss...more miss than hit.  Downgraded to 3 out of 5 for this reason."}
{"text":"I was there with my husband to celebrate his birthday today.  We came in and waited to be seated. There was a party ahead of us so we waited but asked a passing waiter if we could just head to the sushi bar and sit down. We were told to wait for the waitress to seat us. So we patiently stood around for about 10 minutes to be seated at the bar, at which there were four open seats. The waitress eventually came and seated the party ahead so we stood at the front desk for a bit. Behind us a couple came in, headed to the bar while indicating to that waitress, who waved back to go ahead, sitting in the two middle of the remaining available seats.  My husband and I looked at each other, then the waitress who then indicated they were a party of three and could not move a seat over to let us sit at the bar as well.   We stood there kind of shocked while the waitress then told us we could either sit at a table ( wouldn't be able to do half rolls which as just two people allows us to enjoy more different rolls) or sit at the separate alcohol bar (no bartender, away from the sushi chefs, kind of dark) or wait for one of the other couples to finish at the bar. We felt pretty slighted. We had stood there politely and waited our turn to be seated, only to have the remaining pairs of seats be taken by an INCOMPLETE party with no apology at all from the waitress. Just a kind of oh well you can wait or sit elsewhere.  It was pretty upsetting to have this happen, especially considering we came for my husbands birthday and wanted to do something nice.   We left. Had come before and enjoyed the food, which brought us back, but don't know if we will be returning for awhile. Seriously if I was able to give 0 star I could!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I've ever had. Food was good, but it took 15 minutes to be acknowledged, another 10 minutes to get our water. We finally placed our first round of AYCE sushi and it took almost an hour to not even get everything that we had ordered.  We finally had enough and decided to just figure out how much each individual order was and cover it with tax and left.  Here's the worst part, the server came out to get us as we got back to our car and told us we needed to pay the full price for the AYCE since we \"got food\" even though we barely got anything. Also that server who confronted us literally only talked to us once. Didn't bother to check in, and starting cussing us out saying he would have to pay for it out of his pocket. And then he turned around and said it wasn't even his table. Eventually we went back in and told the manager we weren't paying anything extra than the individual orders and she said ok.  Absolutely inexcusable. The kicker was that we went to McDonald's right after and they apologized for the wait when it would take 2 extra minutes for the fries to be ready."}
{"text":"We came here at 9 pm on a Sunday for dinner. The restaurant was not busy, we were sat fairly quickly. Our waiter waited until our entire party was present before checking to see if we wanted to order. By the time we ordered and food was starting to come out, we were told that it was last call at 9:45 (they close at 10:30). I fm felt rushed and pressure to order more food to make sure I got my money's worth for AYCE. The rest of our food including dessert came out and by 10:15 the staff was mopping and cleaning around us. There were still at least 6 tables still eating while employees were rushing around trying to close up for the night.   I find this extremely unprofessional and terrible for service. Even though the food was good, I felt that I didn't enjoy it because I felt rushed. It was pretty clear that the patrons were being kicked out, the closer it got to 10:30, the more unwelcome I felt.   This location gets 2 stars only because the food is good but the service is horrendous."}
{"text":"The food has gotten a little better since the last two years or so. The service has ranged from mediocre to excellent; it seems to be hit or miss. The people who have worked there longer seem to be comfortable, whereas those who are newer work a little harder to ensure better service. Sometimes it takes a while for a waiter or waitress to come back and check on you, and sometimes they're always there. Sometimes the food comes timely, and sometimes not so quickly, even on the slower days. Again, hit or miss.   This is a great place to bring company, as it is decently and comparably priced, clean, and modern. But we've also had better food at more hole-in-the wall places; the only thing is that it is not as presentable as Oyshi. I guess it depends on what you're looking for -- pretty decent food with a modern feel, or excellent food with a less presentable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here on a suggestion and WOW is all I can say. The sushi was fresh and delicious and the variety is awesome. The fact that it is so close to where I live helps a lot also. The Green Tea ice cream is a perfect way to cap off a great dinner. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Very good, especially for an all-you-can-eat restaurant. Sat at the sushi bar and the chefs were very helpful and entertaining."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Great service.  Reasonable price for all you can eat Sushi.  I like the fact that you can order everything from the menu.  There are many selections of sushi and more variety of Japanese food.  Their sushi is pretty fancy and fresh.  It's a great deal, only $30/person for dinner.  Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Sunday night here is pretty packed but people here are very accommodating and friendly. Their AYCE is the bomb!! So my mom and I ordered their Monster, (a little sweet for me), Lobster Fair (omg this is one is freaking good!), Japanese Garlic Lasagna, and many more! However, their Salmon Lover was a little bit so so for us cause the salmon wasn't fresh at all, they used frozen ones. For appetizers, their Seaweed Salad, Ahi Poke, Baked mussels were pretty good. And of course, for dessert, I got some green tea ice cream and their tiramisu too! So yummy! We're definitely looking forward to eat here again besides we just live near here!"}
{"text":"First time and Overall everything was good, but the waitress was kind of slow and didn't really pay attention to our table !"}
{"text":"By far this is the WORST service I have ever had in ANY restaurant. To begin with I went in with my boyfriend for a nice sushi dinner date which I was super excited for. The host said that the wait would be 30 minutes for two which was okay. We were then seated and I was fine because it seemed to be under the said time. After 5  minutes of sitting our server, Ploi, comes and takes our order : 3 orders of shrimp tempura, 1 agedashi tofu, baked muscles, and poki. 5 minutes pass, 10 minutes pass, a table next to us is seated and they place their order. Our server than returns and we place our sushi order because why not? We're already waiting. Another 5 minutes pass and the table next to us gets their food. WHAT? Then we get our sushi order and finish all of that. Then after a grand total of 35 minutes we get our appetizers. They gave us one order of shrimp tempura but it was fine we just ordered me. After that we get a roll on our table that we didn't order. A rainbow roll. I am very allergic to avocado and if a roll came to our table with avocado inside instead of outside and I ate it I would've gotten extremely sick. Food was good. Service was terrible. Compared to busier places in chinatown the service here was a joke. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants. The service here is exceptionally great. All you can eat is the normal choice. Great roll selection, lobster fair, simply shrimp, pink lady, steak plates, tempura, seaweed salad, poke, etc. The music here is always current and up to date. Toni my waitress was delightful. Her sense of urgency and service is what kept me coming back."}
{"text":"Had Father's Day plans this past Sunday at Oyshi with our family. We called to make a reservation at 7:00pm in one of their private rooms, but when arriving to the location, the hostess and manager told us that \"unfortunately\" the person we spoke to on the phone forgot to put the reservation into their system. Our family was visiting from California - but plans were ruined on a very special occasion."}
{"text":"All you can sushi spot. A ways away from the Vegas strip. Came here for a group lunch. The set up of this AYCE sushi is cool. You can order individually and instead of placing multiple rolls and other orders in one big plate they served em to you personally so you could easily identify which roll is which.   One of my personal favorite rolls was the \"treasure roll\". I'd recommend trying that especially during the AYCE menu. Also for the appetizers, get the surf and turf it's shrimp and beef. Staff was really friendly and accommodating. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Fire!! Chef Ed killing the game...again! -Ahi Tuna wasabi and special sauce on tempura seaweed"}
{"text":"Discovered this gem  by yelping restaurants in the area.  I was starving!  Skipped breakfast so I was extra hungry!  Decided to try this place because they had AYCE sushi and they just opened.  We were the first people there.    Lunch time AYCE is $23.  There was a good selection to choose from.  I always have to get the poke salad!  Most places I go to the seaweed salad is always fishy.  Omg!!! Perfect seaweed salad not fishy at all!  The poke was sashimi style nothing added to it.  I could it the poke and soy sauce all day, it was that good!  The sushi rolls were good.  I will definitely be back to try the dinner which was $35 and it offered sangrias!!!"}
{"text":"My friend suggested that we check this place out.  I was pleasantly surprised that the venue was much bigger than I thought it was.  Also the All You Can Eat Menu had a lot of different things that I haven't seen on other menus around town.  The sushi was great.  The one roll I compare restaurants with is the salmon skin roll and I liked it here."}
{"text":"Found hair in soup and waiter lied said its something else. Service is bad and unresponsive. Food was not good. Believe me I'm a cook. Im also a well travelled asian. 2 star for decent atmosphere. Good job interior designer."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this place. LOVE their AYCE menu, but I hate how I have gotten an upset stomach not once but twice after eating here. Last time we came here they had a C health department rating and we didn't notice it until we left- and these are suppose to be properly displayed not next to the door where you can only see once you are leaving.  I will probably still come back every now and then but ever since getting sick twice I just feel like I should probably find another sushi place near my house. The servers are okay, I have only had one server that was attentive the rest usually just stop by every now and then or whenever you wave them down-- which would be understandable on busy nights but I have only ever been there after dinner rushes."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and yet I forgot to do a review. Me & the husband love this place. Andy the manager is always friendly and helpful. The fish is always fresh. I do like the variety of  rolls,  appetizers, and dessert.. Strangely enough, I've never really had any of their dessert because we seem to pig out of the AYCE and never have room for it at the end. The price is decent for quality and amount of food you get.  They have a large parking lot so, no worries about a parking space."}
{"text":"Great sushi given the location. Price and quality were in line and they are super nice.  If you are traveling and looking for a quick in/out, this is a perfect spot."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprise by this sushi place . very affordable and good food quality . SErvice was great , I really recommand this place . Salmon and avocado rolls were amazing ."}
{"text":"Great spot of lunch. All you can eat for 27 bucks is nice. I always sit at the bar and my always come out quick and to my liking."}
{"text":"Lunch $ 21.00 / Person - Dinner $ 26.00 / Person for AYCE.  Rice, rice, rice and a brick of rice in my belly. This place really knows how to give the illusion of a good fish to rice ratio by giving lengthy fish slices, but underneath you meet your doom of impending rice. They compacted the rice so it was thick like a rock.  The menu selection is not great for AYCE, you have many limits on what and where you can order from. No sashimi, no soft shell crab (only in rolls), no half rolls, all the rolls are large standard size -mostly 8 pieces with the exception of some that are 5 pieces (still the same large size as the 8 pieces, just cut differently.) Not a great place if you want to try a bunch of different rolls. Even the nigiri selection was limited and overall pretty unimpressive.  Don't even think about ordering the ahi poke, seafood salad, salmon skin salad, or any of their salads for that matter. They were crazy weak in flavor/ fish/ execution. I wasn't happy with them. At all.   The only redeeming dishes were: 1. Dynamite appetizer  2. Salmon belly nigiri 3. Baked mussels  4. Green tea creme brûlée And that's it...  The service we received was below average. They weren't even busy! There were 2 other tables dining besides us. We had to ask multiple times to different servers to grab us wasabi and hot sauce. Our waitress was missing, most of our dinner.  In the end, we left feeling uncomfortably stuffed due to the dense rice expanding. To top it off, it was hot and stuffy in there, and the music made my ears bleed. I agree the interior design was new, modern, beautiful, and spacious, but the overall night club vibe of the restaurant was highly disconcerting.   In a city that loves a good AYCE sushi joint, this is not the place to go. I would recommend another Korean ran spot that does a better job: Sakana.   Now, with a belly busted from rice, I bid you good luck and good evening."}
{"text":"I live on this side of town and for an AYCE and high volume restaurant the service and quality is great! There is often a wait at prime dinner times but that a good sign if you ask me :-) We often do our girls nights here and I don't see that changing any time soon!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing is all I can say!  I am a Sushi rookie but this place makes me want to eat it all the time!"}
{"text":"When eating AYCE here, stuff your faces with everything from the appetizers, nigiri to the dessert... everything was good.  Especially the dessert.  The maki rolls are packed with a lot of rice and are portioned so large, they do not fit the mouth, and they will fill you up after 1 order.    We would go back if the service was a little warmer.  I was \"reprimanded\" by the host for letting my toddler walk around the dining area.  Says he's getting in the way.  Seriously?  I'm already not fully enjoying my meal coz my kid is acting up.  You're supposed to make me feel better, not worse.  I curse you host with tantrum toddlers, many of them!  Hehe."}
{"text":"The biggest piece of salmon I had been served so far in Toronto :-). I enjoyed my plum wine. I recommend to order it with your dessert. It is as sweet as Port.  I wouldn't go back because the place is tiny and you can hear everyone's conversation. Good place to order take out though."}
{"text":"I've been here too many times to not write a review.  Service has always been great. Every waiter/waitress that have waited on my party and I have been attentive and polite.  We usually come here for dinner/late night. Our orders were always correct and it comes out pretty quick...I'd say within 10-15 minutes.  We ALWAYS order the ATOMIC BOMB ($11). And yes...it's bomb dot com. We also order the usual spicy tuna roll. Here at Oyshi they make one of the best spicy tuna rolls. Some spicy tuna rolls are not even spicy...but here, there's a great kick to it.  We've also tried other rolls like Love Affair, Heart Attack ($9-13) and a few others. Didn't really leave a lasting impression.  A few days ago, we tried the JAPANESE GARLIC LASAGNA and it was yummy!!!! Soooo now I got a new roll added to my usual two.  Can't wait to be back! Never disappoints! =)"}
{"text":"Love this place! !  Was a patron of the original one on Rainbow,  but this one is close to my house and am now a regular! !  Sushi chefs are awesome,  know us and make us original awesome things to try. The bartender knows us and automatically brings us the Nigori Sake we like.  Thank u!!"}
{"text":"My very best sushi stop ever. The All You Can Eat items are the best variety that I've seen. The service can't be beat. The atmosphere is perfect. I absolutely love it here."}
{"text":"I come to this location a lot, usually i come earlier, but tonight I got off work at 11, and really wanted sushi, I called and googled to see if Oyshi is still open, it says it closes at 2am and they told me they were still open, by the time I get there it's 12am, ask I'm walking in, all the chairs were already stacked up and they told me they are completely closed, At 12am!  it's very annoying when you googled and called to make sure, and when you get all the way there, they drop the bomb on you saying that they are closed, when clearly on the window it says open until 2am, on the website it says open until 2am, and on the phone they say they are open!  So I feel very manipulated!! And very upset by this!"}
{"text":"Very good service and selections. Steak, pork belly and oysters ( dinner only ) are available with AYCE. Nice ambiance and not much noise.     I'll continue to visit."}
{"text":"If you're gonna do all-you-can-eat sushi you might as well come here. The sushi is decent, the service is good and the vibe is great! It's great that you can order hot plates, appetizers and desserts in addition to sushi.  We've come in with our two young children a few times and the staff has always tried to get us comfortable (read: secluded) table which we appreciated.  Not sure if it is poor ventilation or what but I always walk out smelling a bit greasy. Keep this in mind if you plan on going out afterwards."}
{"text":"We can't decide if we want to call this place,  \"Oyshi-No-No\" or \"Oy-She-Didn't\"  ENVIRONMENT  Very large room divided into different areas. It seemingly looks good, but upon further inspection, it's clear that something isn't right -- dirty plates, strange Saran wrapped bottles at the bar.  FOOD The quality of fish is definitely low-brow. I believe we saw signs for all-you-can eat-options, so it's expected I suppose, but just don't get your hopes up.   SHOUT OUT The Volcano Roll comes Honey-boo-boo style.  SERVICE Horrible. The waiter always came to our table apologizing when he didn't do anything and that's when he actually came to our table. Please invest in training your staff, or continue to see these reviews about your service.   AFTERMATH It's probably best you go somewhere else if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"This place sucks and I never even ate a thing here. I drove past a few of my faves on Saturday evening 5/14/11 only to find myself being ignored while standing in the doorway for over 5 minutes. Four different people who are employed there including the manager behind the sushi bar saw us and 2 other groups of people behind us and still no acknowledgment. No one wanted to even tell us that they did not have tables and what the expected wait would be. Ill wait if its worth it. I bailed and will never darken their entry again. They have to learn that there are so many options that are good out there. I drove out to Summerlin and ate at a Sushi bar on Lake Mead and Rampart called\" It's Sushi\". It does not have AYCE available. However the superior quality of the fish makes eating anything there great. The prices are fair. They do have a Happy Hour."}
{"text":"First timer here and I'm SOLD!! Sushi and apps are on point! Our server was awesome! Very attentive and able to suggest roles & meat to our liking I will definitely be Coming back to this location no just for the great food but also for the fantastic service"}
{"text":"Food was ok but overpriced for $27 AYCE, our server was slow and never checked up on us. I constantly had to ask the busser to get our server, since he wasn't allowed to take any additional orders. Very disappointed. One of our rolls had questionable fish. It definitely wasn't fresh. Won't be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Great service, Casual atmosphere and amazing food. Best sushi in town! I recommend this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Okay but not the best.   Ate here today for the first time. The waiters were nice and they were very attentive, but the food took longer than expected, especially appetizers. All we ordered we poke bowls but it took about 15 mins to actually get it. Then we ordered 3 rolls and the restaurant wasn't even busy but it took them at least 20 mins...   Also I wouldn't drink their water. Had a very metallic and off putting taste to it. No bueno. And their nigiri is very small! I was surprised at the amount of rice they had with each piece of nigiri! The rolls did taste good, they were just smaller compared to other rolls at other sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"Love it love it love it!!! It's a regular sushi bar with an 'all you can eat' option. (Does not include sashimi). So delicious. You can even get 1/2 size sushi rolls to dance around the menu. The crunchy tuna was my favorite. I also loved that you can get soup, salad, tempura, poke, and all other appetizers included. Loved it so much I went 2 nights in a row."}
{"text":"Have had mixed experiences with service. Sushi is good but really only rolls with rice , no quality rolls without rice or other healthy options. The rolls we had were good, the spicy tuna is good no matter which roll choose"}
{"text":"We finally checked out the new location of Oyshi at Sahara.  It's nice and roomy.  As usual sushi was good.  They had some new stuff on the menu.  I'll be sure to try them next time. We got to see Nyi again.  I think he actually remembers us although we haven't seen him in years.  This location is a little far from us but we'll be back for sure when we're in the neighborhood.  Otherwise we'll be at the Rainbow location bugging Ryan and Justin.  Ha ha!!!"}
{"text":"The service and food is okay. Although there sushi is always gonna be same amount of fish and rice ratio. The only bad thing about this place is the sushi takes 30 to 40 minutes to come out. I ended up staying here for 2 and half hours because the food took so long to come out. I would rather go to other location which gives better service and food.   They had already did auto gratuity which I don't mind but they could at least did a better job on taking care of us."}
{"text":"Been coming here for about a year already and the sushi is still bomb!! Usually sushi places fall off once they become more popular but not here! Definitely recommend it, also they have a great verity of amazing appetizers."}
{"text":"Sushi-great ; service- great music- wtf?? Electronic dance music during dinner?? Ugh this is not Sushi Samba! Totally out of place. Annoying atmosphere to say the least. Unfortunately my wonderful dinner was accompanied by aweful club style trap music.. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice but I doubt there will be a third visit. As for the food, it's pretty good. Nothing extraordinary, but pretty average. I got the all you can eat, and I got my $21 worth. No complaint there. But the sushi isn't very authentic in that it's nothing a Japanese person would readily recognize. Seems to be part of this \"fusion\" sushi movement. I told the sushi chef it wanted an omekase selection, and he had no idea what I was talking about. BAD SIGN! I probably should have just given up and gone to Osaka, but alas I stayed. Most of the rolls were average, but the yellowtail trio had a terrible ginger sauce. I couldn't finish it.   Aside from the food, the service was non-existent. I moved to a quiet corner to avoid a very loud group and I was completely forgotten. I had to get up and ask for my check after 15 minutes of waiting.  My biggest complaint is with the music. There is rap music blaring, even on a Sunday afternoon. I guess they're trying to attact a young, hip crowd, but they're really only driving away customers. I asked them to turn down the music to no avail, and left with a pounding headache and resolved not to come here again."}
{"text":"We love coming to this place for sushi, but was very unhappy with our visit tonight. We always sit at the bar because we like to watch them make our food, and their sushi chef who has a blue pony tail had a major attitude. He was a complete jerk. Was swearing and yelling at his coworkers and was extremely unprofessional. Might try again sometime but will not be served by him again...."}
{"text":"Food quality and taste 5/5  Service 2/5 If you do the AYCE (all you can eat) they take years to bring anything and forget some of your order because they take so long which forces you to constantly repeat and ask about the food you ordered.   Price 3/5  Kinda expensive  Overall experience 3/5"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and the food was pretty great and the service was awesome definitely recommend it to anyone who is a sushi lover definitely is the spot come and have some good sushi"}
{"text":"This was our first time coming to Oyshi and we will definitely come again! The food was delivered in a timely manner and tasted delicious! My boyfriend is allergic to avocado and cucumber (unfortunately) so finding good sushi can be a bit hard for him. Our waitress, Odi, was very cooperative and made sure that whatever he ordered was completely free of his allergies! I also noticed that she was really busy, every table in the place packed, however she remained very calm and checked on us frequently to make sure we had the food we needed and that we were doing okay. Thank you Odi for making our first experience a great one! We will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Great food! All the sushi is nice and fresh. Great service. Only negative is how loud it can be with everyone talking. Must be the sake kicking in. LOL"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi, great food! We had a great time having dinner with our friends there.The servers were super nice and helpful. We loved the new location!"}
{"text":"Used to be great but quality and service so bad now. This neighborhood is ripe for an all you can eat sushi place.  If you sit at the bar it's the best  bet.  But maybe just drive ten more minutes out to a better place."}
{"text":"Had the all-you-can-eat dinner with the family tonight.  The food was fantastic and the service even better.  Our waiter Golden was outstanding, knowledgeable, attentive and gracious.  Thanks for a great evening!"}
{"text":"We had the all-you-can-eat sushi and went a little crazy. The surf-and-turf is a delicious appetizer, and will come out to your table steaming on a cast iron plate. The peppered yellow tail was another one of my favorite appetizers, with a smokey flavor. The \"Lava Flow\", \"Japanese Lasagna\" and \"Heart Attack\" were three of my favorite rolls. Dessert is included in the AYCE deal, and I enjoyed the creme brûlée."}
{"text":"I hate saying the word \"date\".  I prefer meet & greet. He was already seated at a table but I preferred the bar as usual when I'm in Sashimi mode.  Cool, noisy place, lots of energy!  Spacious table setting for groups and can be romantic.  The waiter was so attentive!  The chef I think was eavesdropping at our conversation lol I ordered a big bottle of sake then seaweed salad - EXCELLENT - usually I share so I have room for the real stuff. To die for sashimi platter  - red snapper, albacore ( wished they had Blue Fin), Spanish Mackerel.  Nice almost perfect sliced pieces. Lots of interesting conversation in between...more Sake.  Finally I offered sake to the Chef which I often do when I'm seated at the bar solo. He accepted and we toasted Kampai. The Piece de resistance to top off my already overstuffed belly - Unagi w avocado hand roll - moist not drenched in sauce.  Not too sweet and seaweed wrap just perfect & crisp for biting into!   I walked away with one of the best meals & company I've had in a long time!  Go and experience it for yourself!"}
{"text":"I thought most tasted fresh n good, though I was not a fan of the dynamite n I thought the popcorn shrimp was a bit too much for 2 ppl (I can't eat that much fried). My favs that I do recommend was the oysters, the mussels, salmon belly(off the specials board), the ahi Poké, agedashi tofu, the uni, the salmon roe with quail egg. The rest of the nigri tasted dry, the ebi ebi roll was alright, n tho I did like the taste of the nyi roll, that don't taste or look like soft shell crab like it says lol"}
{"text":"Insane, been here plenty times before and just being seated there was still rice, sticky floors on our table and our hostess once contacted about the situation told us well that's everywhere. What kind of answer is that? I've never left a bad review on yelp before. Please look through. This had to have been the most ignorant thing anyone has ever said to me when having an issue, I'm very easy going. Hope the owner sees who / what type of people he's hiring, unbelievable."}
{"text":"Great as usual, can never get enough of this place!! Love the all you can eat sushi and appetizers."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and the all-you-can-eat was great. They got super busy, but kept up with all their orders in a timely mannner.  The chefs were great!  Super friendly, fun to talk to at the bar."}
{"text":"The quality of fish was not great. Another ayce sushi failure :/ fish to rice ratio was not good either. I asked not to put too much rice but they still did. Rice was too dense, felt like they really squeezed rice hard. Nothing was impressive here, I felt like it was waste of $26.   On top of that, fish was really not fresh! I started feeling sick as returning to hotel and as soon as I got there I threw up everything. It was a bad experience. Won't return."}
{"text":"My wife (who surprisingly doesn't eat seafood) was introduced to this place and she's addicted.  She gets all the egg rolls and teriyaki chicken and beef she can eat, and even some rolls without fish.  The all you can eat deal it great.  I leave feeling like I will never need to eat again.  The food is great, the service is good, and the Mochi desert is interesting.  Even the kids meal is quite large for being only $6.  If you want good sushi, this is your place.  They make the rolls after you order them so be sure to be patient and order several rolls at a time so you don't have to wait for a long time between orders."}
{"text":"This place has awesome sushi. I recommend getting the all-you-can-eat. Quality and fresh sushi that doesn't break the bank. When we were there, the chef made us a special flamin hot Cheetos roll. I don't usually order rolls, but this was pretty darn unique and good. Service was awesome and friendly. Definitely recommend this place. Will go back soon!"}
{"text":"This used to be our AYCE spot but not anymore!  The food is great however the service is not so appealing! This actually caused us to venture elsewhere and now there's no turning back. You shouldn't be questioned whether you can eat all you order! I am there to eat for goodness sakes don't tell me not to order too much. I do understand there's time when people do order excessively and cannot finish their food. But that's not everyone so please stop asking us if we can finish what we order, I'll pay for extra if that day comes!   My new spots, Yama sushi, Sushi Koma, and Umiya!"}
{"text":"1) Ambiance: Modern, busy, high energy with techno/dance music playing.  2) Price: Comparable to most AYCE Sushi Joints $21 Lunch/ $26 Dinner  3) Service: Slow as far as food preparation. Spent nearly 2 hours on AYCE for 2 people. The servers & management were very nice though. Drinks were always refilled and they came around to check up on us often.  4) Food: Some of the things we ordered.  Appetizers- Baked Green Mussels were good. I could eat 100. Asian Style Skirt Steak - Came out on a sizzilin' platter & smelled terrific but I wasn't diggin' the taste. Nothing special.  Sushi- Fish was eh... just ok. Not as fresh.  Favorite Rolls- Amigo - jalapeno, combination of fish and cream cheese w/ flaming hot chili sauce. Jalepeno-licious! Love Affair - shrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster, crunch flakes. Scrumptious!  5) Overall: Satisfactory. There were a lot of things we wanted to try but were too full. I would give this place another shot."}
{"text":"The sushi here is so good! Ever since I left there I've been craving their sushi. I'll definitely be coming back here ASAP.  My only complaint is we had to wait a while to be seated when the waiters were just standing around, but they were pretty friendly and patient for a newcomer to sushi like myself"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be okay both food wise and service wise. I'm not sure what's going on these days but the service isn't as good as it used to be. The half of restaurant is empty and they are making us wait 10 min. Why? I always tell myself it s my last time here when I come here. This time, I am 100% positive, WILL be my last time here. There are SO MANY other GOOD aye sushi places. I suggest try them not here"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. Overall awesome experience. Fresh fish and tasty rolls. Salmon sushi was some of the freshest I've ever had. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Just superb. Vince, our waiter, did an excellent job attending us and explaining how the AYCE menu works. This will be our go to place for sushi."}
{"text":"Compared to other sushi joints in the Las Vegas area I would rather go somewhere else. The vibe here is ok, good spacious restaurant with loud music. But if you're into that kind of thing go ahead.   Food wise they could cut back on the rice. The rice they put is a little much. I like to judge a sushi joint by their Unagi (eel) i was not impress with the unagi here. It was a little cold.   Overall it was ok.just okay"}
{"text":"Couldn't be happier with this restaurant.  Greeted quickly and requested a booth that they cleaned right away and were sat, ordered drinks and then the waiter, Ryan started making suggestions for food.  Since I'm veganish, I didnt want traditional sushi or the sauces containing fish and they had several items on the menu to order.   And I think I tried al of them.  The potato crustini I think it was called was incredible, like deep fired mashed potatoes! Order it without the sauce if your not a meat eater.  I also had the tempura fried veggies and tofu and a veggie \"sushi\" roll that seriously couldn't have been more happy with.  (See the pics within the post).  The place is clean, upscale modern decor, clean bathrooms and the food and drinks arrived quick!  Ryan repeatedly came back to make sure everything was good and if anything else was needed.  I've read some mixed reviews on here and have to say none of the things I read were my experience here.  Every place has off days and home run days, but I have to believe the way my experience went today is more the norm.  Highly recommend it and will definitely be coming back in the future."}
{"text":"marcos was an amazing server! he was really genuine and attentive, not to mention the food was fresh & extremely delicious! i've ate at oyshi many times but this time was especially memorable, my little girl ate sushi for the first time!!!"}
{"text":"Pedro is the best chef! Great service and his special dishes are to die for! Ask for Pedro's specials! Thank me later.."}
{"text":"My daughter and I make this our first stop when coming to Las Vegas.  Never disappoints.  Staff, chef's, food dynamite.  Making a reservation is suggested, because it fills up fast, but sitting at the bar you can watch chef's prepare your rolls, and sped is quality.  The all you can eat is the key.  Thanks once again; see you next year."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi is what they are known for. The sushi is good, some of the best I have had in Vegas. This location seems much quicker and cleaner then the others. A bit over priced, overall good value."}
{"text":"Went in with my girl for lunch and had a HORRIBLE dining experience.  I have worked in the restaurant industry for over 7 years and it has been awhile since I had such horrible service/food.    When we walked in, there was no host/hostess to greet/seat us.  After waiting for 2 minutes, we decided to seat ourselves at the sushi bar.  The restaurant was not packed but had a decent lunch crowd for a sunday.  Numerous servers passed by us and pretty much ignored us.  On top of that, there were 4 sushi chefs behind the counter who did not acknowledge us at all.  Probably after 5 minutes, the manager came by and asked us if we would like something to drink.  It took him probably at least another 5 minutes to grab us our waters.  After placing our order with him, it took another 15-20 minutes to get any of the sushi we ordered.  Talking from a server perspective, how hard is it to make sushi??? There is no cooking involved!  When we finally got our order, I was very disappointed.  The quality of the fish is very subpar and the portions are very small for the price.   All in all, the restaurant itself is nice and has a nice ambiance, but the customer service quality of the servers and sushi chefs are waaaaayy below average.  I would not recommend going here!!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! Love this place! My favorite is their salmon skin salad and they all so have all you can eat option. More bang for your buck! The staff are polite and very attentive. This place is pretty much pack so come in early."}
{"text":"We love this place! I do not eat raw sushi but they have a selection to satisfy everyone on their menu."}
{"text":"The sushi was great!  It was fresh and had great preserntation.  If you like both the traditional and contemporary sushi, this is the place to go.   I recommend getting the \"all you can eat\" selection.  You can order appetizers, rolls, hot food, and a dessert.  For $26.00 plus tip & tax, it's a grea value.  They also have a private room for small parties."}
{"text":"Omg...after all these time that passed by and I am back here again ..same problem exists, the long wait to be seated even if we came after dinner time already. It's taking sooooo long for us to be seated and it's only 2 of us...frustrating and disappointing. So if you guys are thinking of coming over here make sure you bring a lot of patience! I tell you the food is nothing extra ordinary eithet. The only reason I am back is because I thought their service has changed. Double thumbs down again so sad :(("}
{"text":"Used to eat there a few years ago And I must to be honest them much do used to be much better Now they're okay Food is okay Service Soso"}
{"text":"I guess it depends on what kind of Japanese food you want.  Their rolls?  Fantastic.  Their heart rolls and volcano rolls were strong in flavor with soft textures.  However... their nigiri is only so-so.  I'd come here if you just want to go wild on ROLLS.  That being said, the service here was excellent.  They really try hard to satisfy your needs here.  The atmosphere/decor was nice too."}
{"text":"Good sushi but recent management changes and loosing staff is hurting them.   Service is not so good at times.    Crazy. I have been posting about Oyshi since this location opened. Some very good some not good but nothing nasty. Yet Yelp took  them  down just stupid. What good is posting your opinion if you get censored and trust me I have posted stuff about other restaurants that was not nice       Well real let down tonight. Can't make my favorite rolls right. Really cold in here.  Severed wrong sushi. Wish the original sushi staff would come back      Came back after being gone for a while. Has to be the worst I have had in all the years I ate here.   Done just done.    Back on their game baby  Not sure who or what changed yet, but this is the Oyshi I raved about for"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. First time at Oyshi's tonight! All you can eat ice cream! Hell yeah"}
{"text":"We had an excellent dinner here tonight! We were a large party of 12 and the service was excellent. Our server/waiter Mikey was especially helpful. He was fast and thorough. We had three small cranky tired children and he made sure everything came out right away for them. For those who also have younger children also know that they usually end up setting the tone for the whole meal! Haha. They were quickly happy and content with their miso soup and rice so that the rest of us could also enjoy our meal. The sushi was fantastic as well. Absolutely loved the green tea creme brûlée!! Thank you again for a great meal. Definitely will be coming back again soon"}
{"text":"Hmmm...I was planning to lose my AYCE sushi virginity to Ms. Goyemon but there was a two hour wait so instead I opted for the next girl available named Ms. Oyshi....I'd rather like to think we didn't go all the way and I'm still saving myself for the former.    For 26 bucks, I think it's definitely in line with Sushi Goyemon, but I happened to be in the company of some friends who had been there as well, so I was able to get some perspective as I proceeded with my first time navigating this a la carte ordering feeding frenzy.  The first few speed bumps which caught my eye were some ground rules listed in the menu:  1. No sashimi, only one order of oysters (4 pieces), uni, and sweet shrimp allowed...fair enough  2. No excess rice shall be allowed to remain uneaten on the plate, otherwise that order will be counted as extra on the final bill....have people been discarding their rice into a large pile assembling a massive sculptured mountain of rice?  The rice that was used to prepare the sushi was highly variable in quality  (too soft, too firm, or mixed) throughout the various rounds of ordering so it only motivated us to concoct creative methods for disposing the rice (hiding it in the tea jar, breaking it into tiny grains and scattering it across the plate so as to create the illusion of a clean plate, and to borrow a technique from a friend who disliked rice during her early childhood, placing said rice into mouth and going to bathroom to dispose in toilet/trash).  Of course none of this was done, but it was tempting nonetheless.  3.  Any orders which are unfinished in general will be counted as extra orders on the final bill...this was adhered yet strangely enough after receiving our final round of food (a modest 2-3 rolls) the server waited when we were rubbing our bellies and chimes in \"you have two more rolls coming!\" and none of us had any idea where these phantom rolls were coming from and she then replies with a snarky shrug  \"I'll take them off your order\" as if she was doing us a favor....pure shenanigans  4. The jalapeno poppers on the appetizer menu were not allowed to be included amongst the AYCE orders....what kind of crazy logic is this?  Wouldn't it be good strategy to fill your customers with heartburn due to fatty spicy cream cheese richness to slow down their intake of much much more expensive items?  Either these are the greatest jalapeno poppers in the history of appetizers or a missed business opportunity.   I don't even like jalapeno poppers but I almost was willing  to eat one just because this condition existed.  THE MEAL  The appetizers  (ahi poke, spicy sashimi salad, and miso soup)  The poke might as well have been unseasoned sashimi, whereas the sashimi salad was overdressed nearly drowning in the chili vinaigrette, and the miso soup was surprisingly not overly salty as I anticipated but ended up being the surprise highlight of the meal.  The \"big three\" (uni, raw oysters, and sweet shrimp)...not exceedingly fresh but no risk of possible food poisoning either, although the oysters had a watered down quality to them....only tasted good since they were not specifically paid for.  The nigiri:  I sampled the surfer clam, spanish mackerel, japanese yellowtail, and a few other standards....there was definitely something I couldn't put my finger on but the level of freshness just seemed 1 level below what you would expect if you ordered these same items at a regular reputable sushi bar.  I'm thinking perhaps they were precut in mass production and by the time they arrived they were partially dried out from the external surface area of each piece of fish being exposed for a prolonged period of time.  The rolls:  Perhaps I've had enough sushi experiences to have progressed beyond rolls since they are drenched in so much sauce (seriously, what is the obsession with orgasm sauce in this town?), crispy shavings of empty calories, or packed with so many types of fish that I couldn't really differentiate any of them out of a sushi roll lineup much like the Seinfeld episode where George tries to catch the Twix bar candy thief (\"It's a SETUP! They're all Caterpillar rolls!!\")  I would try to limit your roll intake and focus on the other items to keep your palate from being overwhelmed(and to avoid the server from pulling that phantom roll maneuver as previously discussed)  Last but not least, we figured we had successfully navigated through the labyrinth of extra charges until we received the final bill which charged us for the hot tea...are you serious???  So you're telling me I could have drank an entire gallon of miso soup instead of one measly cup of hot green tea which cost you pennies to brew?  Perhaps these were some tea leaves taken from the Emperor's garden, but I would appreciate a warning next time.    3 stars only because we definitely still got our money's worth, but I'm leaving a few more stars to be earned since my friends reassured me Goyemon is better."}
{"text":"I love sushi and I love this place. It's nice little noisy but it has some beauty in it . good place . yummyyyy"}
{"text":"tldr  I'm partial to the Rainbow location but this is closer to me. Service was surprisingly slow i think we had a waiter in training; drink refills and orders took a long time. The busser actually did a great job filling in and taking order while cleaning up. Very limiting on the baked green mussels.  Get: -Asian skirt steak -love affair -spider roll -monster roll"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars. The rolls are really good and they have a variety of different ones to choose from. I think I'm a third done with trying all the different rolls.  Last time I went they were very pleasant and attentive to our drinks and our rolls came out in a timely fashion. (Which I love cause nothing sucks more than having to wait for AYCE. You get full faster.) This experience varied extremely different over my first visit where it felt like they couldn't wait for us to leave!  I can happily say that Oyshi has taken up my favorite spot on this side of town. It beat Nagoya hands down."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going since opening week! I looove their sushi and you cant beat the price! The love affair and the tuna! Always fresh! Also try that green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"We always come in for sushi and food is always good and fresh.  Just want to say that our server Bess was super sweet, attentive and just awesome."}
{"text":"Bomb ass sushi and a great menu selection. The all you can eat allows you to try many different items. I enjoyed it and will be back."}
{"text":"Finally went to Oyshi yesterday (as it was recommended by my friend).  The atmosphere was pretty awesome.  They had a spacious seating arrangement, colorful decor, Xgames and the Laker's Game on TV, and Techno music playing in the background (not really what I had expected in a Sushi joint).  We came for the AYCE @ about $22.00 for dinner.  It's decently priced for AYCE.  The price does not include a drink.  The selection of food on the menu was pretty good.  They had a good assortment of appetizers, specialty rolls, and traditional Nigiri (not to mention hand cut Maki rolls).  I am a big fan of Sashimi, but like 99% of the time, the Sashimi is not included in the AYCE.  I did however stock up on the Sake (raw Salmon) Nigiri.  Being my favorite Nigiri, I found their Sake Nigiri to be very very fresh.  It was super bright orange and tasted incredible!  For dessert, they have a few different flavors of Mochi, but you can only get one.  If I remember correctly, the flavors are as follows: Green Tea, Mango, and Red Bean.  I opted for the Mango and wish I could have had a second since they were pretty small in size.  Anyhow, the Sake Nigiri alone would have gotten Oyshi 4 stars, but unfortunately the service was extremely slow.  On top of that, the only soup available was the Miso Soup.  How do you not have Udon on the AYCE menu?  Seriously?? They also did not have low-sodium soy sauce (I know it still has like 800mg per tbsp , but that's better than 1000mg).  Overall, I'd come here again... I just hope my server can keep my water cup filled."}
{"text":"Oyshi Sushi is one of the best sushi place in town! The service was fast thanks to EJ for providing us the best service every time I come here. I would definitely come back here not just because of the food quality but also for the wonderful service that is provided. The place is clean and very welcoming thanks Oyshi Sushi you served me well"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed with the service I got tonight during my \"AYCE\" experience here. I understand that it can get busy here and there, but it would be nice to have your server check up on how things are going. NOT once did our server check on our table and we waited about 15 minutes per order.. Horrible! -_-  2 stars for the bus boys!"}
{"text":"Oyshi, always a pleasure to eat at your establishment. Great service and awesome sushi."}
{"text":"We at the all you can eat AYCE and it was awesome!! Food was yummy and fresh and it kept coming.  We had a party of 11 so we got our money's worth ...yummy food"}
{"text":"Very fresh sushi. All you can eat for $26 which is a steal for the quality of the sushi here. Green tea tiramasui is equally creative and delicious. A sure winner for any dinner."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Great service. Great atmosphere .   We've been coming here for years and won't go to any other sushi spot. The servers know us and remember our orders. We usually come on a weekday lunch and it's not too busy.  If you come before 3:30pm it's a little cheaper for lunch pricing.  With all-you-can-eat you have the freedom of ordering all appetizers, all sushi (excluding sashimi) and dessert to finish.  Their fish is extremely fresh and the sushi chef's will make special requested rolls if you ask. They have a great selection on their menu of specialty rolls and descriptions. If you sit at the sushi bar you have the option to order 1/2 rolls if you want to try something new but aren't sure if you'll like it.  Make sure you eat what you order. Don't be that person! If you are completely stuffed they won't nickel and dime you if you don't eat one or two pieces but don't put your server in that awkward spot to charge you. The restaurant is a big open venue and they have private dining rooms too for special events. They play great music all day and it's  not too loud during lunch. Dinner however is more trendy, music is louder, the crowds are bigger and the lights are turned low. Expect to wait on Friday and Saturday nights! I've been quoted up to a 90 minute wait!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great all you can eat option,  but often times I just sit at the bar and get some hand rolls. The spicy tuna with avocado is my favorite.  There's alot of sushi choices in Vegas but this is asking my favorites. The service is always excellent.  Very focused on your satisfaction."}
{"text":"I still love this place. When we want sushi we want Oyshi!  With that said, here's my rant....no matter what night you go here it's ALWAYS packed. That's not my gripe. Upon our recent visit I noticed that they took out some of the tables to put in a rather large hostess stand. This place is already small and crowded, why would you take away seating???  Ok end rant....."}
{"text":"I've been to Oyshi several times now and I absolutely love the sizzling rib eye, beef yakitori and vegetable tempura appetizers. My favorite rolls are the oh my heart, to die for! And the Philly roll   The food is great, the reason I'm only rating 3 stars is because the last 2 times I went the service was awful. Our server was super busy with a large private party and forgot to submit our order, of course it felt like forever to get food. I truly hope the service improves, if not there are plenty of other great restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Oyshi Sushi- My go to! I love this place, and im there at least three times a month. I go for the AYCE option. It is like $23 for lunch and $27 for dinner. Try to go for lunch, there isn't a lot different in dinner except for a higher price. Service could be improved! 8/10 times I visit, I get wonderful servers! But then theres a few times I get a server who never refills drinks, slow on taking orders, not being very attentive. Other than that I love this place! The rolls are delicious! I reccomend the Love Affair (crab and crunchy flakes) or the Crunchy Roll (popcorn shrimp and yum yum sauce) or basically everything else on the menu. You get delicious food for a reasonable price, only wish servers were a little more welcoming but other than that, this is the place!!"}
{"text":"4/8/2018:  This is our first visit here. Hubby took the AYCE lunch @ $23.00 and I had the Dinner Sushi @ $18.00.  For my meal, miso soup was served first and it was nothing to write home about. Bland and watered down. Certainly not full-bodied and there was no real \"miso\" taste to it. It's like they were holding out on the miso - too expensive to put more in the soup? To their credit, though, they did put a generous amount of wakame (seaweed) but only a small amount of tiny, tiny cubes of tofu. Dang. Tofu isn't THAT expensive! Eating their miso soup was like drinking lightly-flavored miso water mixed in with wakame and a diminutive amount of tofu bits.  Then came the tossed salad, which was a good-size salad but the dressing was minuscule. So stingy on the dressing, OMG.   The tempura dish was very good! Hot (temperature-wise) and flavorful and I thoroughly enjoyed THIS dish!  Now the main dish came out, which was a variety of sashimi on top of shredded daikon (radish) and shiso leaves (very delish...LOVE these leaves!). No rice. After a long while, I finally inquired about having rice and the gal looked on our table, noting no rice there and retrieved a bowl of round-top rice.   Now back in the day when I was growing up, you NEVER served rice with a rounded top. This way of serving rice was reserved for dead people. Yep...DEAD people. My grandma used to serve little bowls of round-top rice to her deceased husband on a little Buddhist shrine she had in her bedroom.  As for the overall ambience, it was beautiful but the music they played was incongruous to the Japanese theme! Instead of quiet-tone, Asian-type music which would have been conducive and appropriate to dining and digestion, they blasted their nightclub-type music which was almost too loud for conversation. Management apparently thinks people enjoy having their eardrums blasted while eating sushi! Taste in music was pure hell - to us, anyway. Even if they played the same type of music but toned down the volume, that would have been tolerable. But they force patrons to listen to music of THEIR liking. Bad business! They are thoughtless to customers' taste in music. If you're going to inflict YOUR type of music on your patrons, have the decency to turn the volume down to background music.  As for the food server, first we had a female take our order and then later on, a male came to our table. He acted like we were putting him out when we asked for more water and a to-go box, which he brought. But when I asked for a plastic bag for the to-go box, he almost sarcastically asked me if there was anything ELSE I'd like??? My goodness. What an attitude! He's there for a job and it's his job to service patrons. It's also HIS fault that he didn't bring a plastic bag along with the to-go box. That's only common sense: You need a plastic bag to put your to-go box in, just in case the box leaks - which DID happen on the ride home.  Not once during our meal did ANYone come to our table to refill our water or ask if everything was alright.  Overall, we did enjoy our meal but because of the ambience, poor service, poor attitude, poor choice of music, lack of service/concern for its patrons, and food quality and amount, we will not be back. There's just too many other places from which to choose! Well you never know until you try, and we tried! Been there, done that."}
{"text":"Everything here is GREAT, love all the AYCE, love all the rolls. Service is good but when it gets busy  (and it does)  it  can take awhile for the food but very worth it."}
{"text":"Was here on a Tuesday it was kinda busy but nothing crazy. Service seems like it went downhill. I have been here before but never checked in."}
{"text":"My go to for AYCE sushi!! Such a great selection at a reasonable price. It's not just sushi on their AYCE menu but appetizers and dessert as well so go hungry! Beautiful location and good service. Their fish is good quality, not ridiculously fine quality of course but very good, and their rice is cooked well unlike most of the other more affordable sushi places in town."}
{"text":"Your average AYCE joint with mediocre fish hidden in a large selection of rolls.  It's not bad if that is your thing....no thanks for me!"}
{"text":"Collosal sized sushi is not necessarily good and this is no exception. However, the service is polite, understanding, and genial. A serene atmosphere punctuates the experience, leaving only a gentle humming noise in the background."}
{"text":"Like the other Oyshi restaurnat, this one is amazing! Oyshi has the best sushi I have ever eaten anywhere in the world. That includes many countries in South East Asia. I recently went there for lunch for the first time and was reminded how good the food and service are. Whenver anyone from out of town comes to visit, I always take them to one the Oyshi restaurants. I have yet to take anyone there who didn't agree it was the best sushi they have ever eaten. Amazing place, great service, tons of roll options, and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"When I visit Las Vegas, I usually come to Oyshi Sushi for sushi. There is plenty of parking around the center. I did not have to wait long for a party of three (15 minutes wait time). The restaurant is a good size and is able to accommodate large parties. I was quite hungry and decided to do the all you can eat sushi! The price for the all you can eat sushi was definitely a good price! For the all you can eat, you can order anything from the menu! The sweet shrimp and dynamite were my favorites. Also, don't forget to order dessert! There are some limitations on the menu for the quantity of sushi that can be ordered for certain items. Also, the restaurant limits only one dessert per person.    I'll definitely be coming back here when I visit Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriends and it was a great place. The environment was great the serves was great and the sushi was great! If you don't eat sushi they have some yummy entrees! We went at 6 pm and it wasn't too busy but as the night went on it got busier ! Keep that in mind !"}
{"text":"Horrible service and food. Came to dinner for the AYCE with a group of nine and the wait service couldn't be any worse. The food ordered either didn't come or was mixed in with another plate (with somebody who's not even seated next to you). There were long wait times before your first and your second order (that's if you actually got what you ordered). We kindly pointed it out to the manager that we weren't getting the appropriate service and all she did was rush through some of the missing orders (and yes I said some because there were still other orders never came). After a while (an hour) it became comedic that one of the first rolls we ordered finally showed up (after telling the waitress no less than 5 times that it was missing). It was the crunch shrimp tempura roll (which, judging by amount of time it took for them to prepare, is apparently a complicated roll).   Overall this was not a good experience. The waitress was disorganized and bad and the manager was ineffective. The idea of an all you can eat sushi sounded good but this place is no where near worth the money you pay to eat there ($28 per person). Oh and the worst was we had to pay 18% gratuity since we were a party of 9. Needless to say they did not earn it.   Bonus: we asked for wasabi (since you know, we are eating sushi) and they brought us two HUGE mounds of wasabis bigger than a fist size for us to share. I mean who needs that much wasabi?!?!? Lol"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Oyshi late Sunday night. We walked up and the lady that goes by Vid (her nickname) was very rude to us. She said, \"We already sat the last seating.\" Then my boyfriend asked her if we could just sit at the sushi bar. She said no. I asked her what time they sat the last seating and she checked the clock and said, \"Oh, we're still seating for 10 more minutes.\" She didn't apologize and kind of laughed it off like it was funny. It was a terrible start. We should have turned around then but we walked over and sat at the bar because we were starving! We put in our order with the waiter which was a large Saki, miso soup, edamame, and chicken terriaki. Then we ordered a couple of rolls with the chefs. What was odd is that our rolls came out before our drink order, which actually never came :(. I also had to ask a total of 3 times for my miso soup. The waiter clearly didn't care about us. For a place that has a pretty decent star rating on yelp I did not see any customer service what so ever. I was so disappointed. Do yourselves a favor and save the trip."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the place opened back years ago. Never have I ever had a bad experience until today. Staff was lacking in actually paying attention to the few people that were in the place. With all these new AYCE sushi spots opening up I'd figure they would've changed the menu just a little but it's been the same ever since ever since. Maybe a few changes, and different rules. I'm all about loyalty and I'll continue to keep coming to this place. Get John and Kevin back in there before this place continues their downward spiral."}
{"text":"All you care to eat lunch $23.   Dinner $28.   The drinks are pretty pricey.  Sushi is always great and the service has greatly improved over the last year.  Wear your parka, they keep it ice cold in here with ceiling fans going full blast. Nice menu selections."}
{"text":"The sushi was okay. The service was very slow, it took 40 minutes to receive 2 rolls despite the 6 sushi chefs behind the bar & the dining area not being full. The servers were unfriendly and we always needed to wave them down to order food. Seemed like they didn't want to serve us. I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 because of the All You Can Eat option for dinner at $28. Fairly priced and would recommend coming on an empty stomach. I probably wouldn't return though because the service was junk."}
{"text":"Plenty of sauce and plenty of rice.  You're better off going to a real buffet that doesn't add tons of sauce to everything you order so that it makes you gag.  Gagging will prevent you from eating more food.  In this case, the \"quality\" is not even up to par with Todai or any other buffet that serves mediocre sushi.  For $5 you can get a jar of mayonnaise or thousand island dressing to eat with your rice so that you can meet your 3000 calorie intake of carbs.  Avoid this place if you are a true sushi connoisseur, or simply like to eat good quality food."}
{"text":"We go here when their competitor gets crowded. When we got there we were seated  promptly. The food here have alway been fresh and consistent but this time it wasn't so. Most buffets start out strong then lose its luster over time. This place is getting there.  I noticed my sushi was packed with a lot of rice. I was kinda full upon ordering the second round but that didn't stop me.  Also the sweet shrimp was a little fishy but it didn't cause any havoc to my tummy.  I hope the owner reads this because we really like this place."}
{"text":"Grocery store quality sushi. Very mediocre and add to it a very slow and sloppy service. I've been to other all you can eat sushi in Vegas and this was really terrible compared to the others I've been to."}
{"text":"Great food!  Yes there is a wait, but that is because the food is cooked FRESH!  My wife was not a Sushi fan...but she is now because if Oyshi.   Grew up eating Japanese food in San Francisco & this tops the list!!"}
{"text":"The sushi was good and fresh....the service was not great at all! They forgot about 4 rolls that we ordered and never brought it to our table. It took about 20 mins to receive our rolls every time we ordered. Definitely not the best experience."}
{"text":"My cousin brought me here while I was visiting Vegas. Currently, I live in the midwest in small-town USA with no real sushi in sight (unless you think imi-crab, mayo and a cucumber wrapped up in rice & seaweed is the bomb.com). After being deprived of fresh sushi for a year, this place was *heaven* (read that again in a sing-songy voice). So at first I wanted to rate this 5 stars but then I had to remember that I was raised in California and Hawaii, so I know a thing or two about quality sushi and quality fish. We both got the AYCE for dinner! Size-wise, the rolls were kinda small. However, the filling to rice ratio was spot on. Some of the rolls were packed full of fish with no crazy veggie fillers so that was pretty great. My favorites were the Lobster Fair (not spicy) and the Dragon Roll (a little spicy). I also got the \"Maniac\" one but that was way hotter than expected. The oysters were SO good. The shrimp tempura was okay. It was nice and hot, but the batter was really thick and heavy, not light like I'm used to. I love love loved the ocean salad they serve before your main courses come.  My only disappointment was that when we ordered a second Lobster Fair towards the end of our meal, we could only eat 1/4 of it and I couldn't take the rest home. =(  [It's probably a rule with the AYCE, which makes sense, but still, it was almost a whole roll!!!]  We finished our meal with the creme brulee dessert. It's almost an amuse-bouche. You can finish it in about 2-3 bites. It doesn't really taste like like creme brulee though, it tastes more like a thick vanilla pudding with a carmelized sugar top that has a beautiful crack when you hit it with a spoon."}
{"text":"This was, by far, the worst dining experience that I've ever had. My girlfriend and I met here for lunch. Our server was apathetic, so say the least. My girlfriend inquired about a lunch special, which was called \"Sizzling Plate\". Our server stood their staring at his notebook and kind of shrugged his shoulders in response. My friend asked him if he was new there, and he mumbled \"kinda new\" while still staring at his notebook. She pulled out the menu and pointed to the plate that she was asking about and went ahead and ordered it. Five minutes later, he came back with a different menu in which the Sizzling Plate was crossed out with a black sharpie. He told us that they no longer offer that special. We asked for a manager, and out came Peter. Peter seems like a very nice person; however, he is by no means management material. It is clear that he has not had any training in diffusing situations or handling customer complaints. He reiterated that they no longer offered that special, even though the special was still listed in the menu that we had received. We went back and forth until I proposed that they honor the special for us until they update all of their menus, to which he obliged. I decided to mention to him that our server was very rude and dismissive, only to hear from Peter that our server was sick and not feeling well. (IMO, our server seemed hungover...) As Peter walked away without apologizing for a rocky start, I saw our \"sick\" server making our drinks, which involved cutting fruit and gathering mint leaves to be muddled. There was no bartender on duty, which was abundantly apparent when we took a sip of our drinks- my drink was supposed to be a strawberry and mint infused lemonade, but it tasted like strawberries and rum... I sent it back. My girlfriend also sent hers back, as it tasted terrible as well. We waited 40 minutes for our food. We had to ask three times for our checks. Once we finally received them, Peter still had not offered an apology for the terrible, apathetic, slow, uniformed service that we received. To no surprise, they had not discounted our checks for the inconvenient and mess of a meal."}
{"text":"Regardless of what the others have been rating this place, I can honestly rate it a good 5 stars! Our first time going because the other place we usually go to; Sumo Sushi 2, which now closes earlier than usual. Tonight, we have ordered the Spicy Tuna, Love Affair, Lobster Fair, and the Vegas Lasagna, let me tell you it was AWESOME ... Absolutely enjoyed ourselves, great customer service, just real nice. It is more of a social sushi spot rather than the one we are used to; which is a more private one, but it was good! It is small, but very comfortable! Highly recommended and enjoyable .."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite all you can eat sushi places in town. We have been going here for years and its nice that it is by us. They have a variety of rolls and as well as appetizers on their menu. The only thing I am disappoint about is that they did not carry white tuna anymore the last time they went."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best ayce sushi places in vegas. In the past I would go to Yama, but I recently moved to south vegas and wanted something closer. My friend and I tried Oyshi and I think this place gives Yama a run for the money. Things that stood out is the raw oysters and surf n turf.  All the sushi was good for ayce style, and the rice was in the nigiri wasn't hard and didn't fall apart like other ayce places. The negative aspects was that the service was a little slow for me, and they brought me one piece of yellow tail that looked like it had been sun bathing out back for the afternoon. Otherwise this place is great, and I'll be returning soon."}
{"text":"The last few times I've been here, the sushi has been solid. I don't understand the subpar reviews considering that this is a very solid venue for ayce sushi.  The prices are slightly higher at about $26 per person during dinner but they have all the amenities you can expect from an ayce joint: Good selection of sushi, shrimp tempura, fried chicken and much more. If you come during 330-530pm they offer 20% on ayce all weekday, which is pretty nice!  The thing that impresses me the most about this place is that the interior is very nice. You will find murals across the room and in one corner of the room there are what seems to be upside down umbrellas for the lighting. There is also a small bar on the corner of the restaurant which is also pretty awesome. I personally always prefer to sit on the stalls by the sushi chef but at this place I don't mind sitting at one of the tables.  Service is on point and friendly. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We have been to this sushi place twice. Both times we have had a great meal, and it has been a lot of fun!!  The first time was for lunch, we did not partake in the All-You-Can-Eat option, rather just ordered a few rolls and apps. The waiter was so friendly and enthusiastic we decided to bring a few people who were visiting back for Dinner.  Now for dinner, hell yes we all did the All-You-Can-Eat! It was $27 bucks each, awesome. We were committed to taking them down! One roll at a time! OK, so we did not end of doing that, but we has a super fun night with lots of great food!  Our waiter Kenny was a rock star! We were goofing and laughing with him all night! And we had a lot to laugh at, because apparently the new food runners had not quite figured out the table numbers and kept delivering our food to other tables, and vice-a-versa. I know this sounds annoying, but oddly enough it became part of the entertainment of the night. Kenny kept checking in to see what we were still waiting for, and making sure it came. We were never missing sushi on the table or going hungry, he just had to order a couple specific rolls 2-3 times before they finally made there way to us. We had a blast!  Insider tips.... -They do take reservations, but the only way to make them is to actually speak to a hostess. The girl at the front desk admitted to me they never check the answering machine.   -They have an awesome large room if you want to have an AYCE shushi party! It is separated from the Dining Room and looks super cozy!  -Last tip, AYCE is less during lunch. Only $22, as opposed to dinner time when it is $27"}
{"text":"AYCE sushi for the win! This is a must go to spot when I hit Vegas. The customer service is straight and the rolls are delicious! The price is reasonable and a it's a great way to enjoy sushi and apps amongst friends!"}
{"text":"The rolls were delicious. Their appetizers such as ribeye steak, chicken teriyaki, shrimp and vegetable tempura, oysters, and green mussels are a must try especially when you're doing all you can eat. The service was superb. The ambiance ok."}
{"text":"On a Friday night passing by the area... we found this place.. wow.. the AYCE is excellent!! Boy was I stuffed.  Told the waitress keep bringing the rolls to me.  Haha.. One Word:  \"Your unbelievable... \"  I keep laughing and eating.. The special rolls are tasty, the sushi are fresh, and the chefs are awesome.  Service - 5 Stars Food - 5 Stars Cleanliness - 5 Stars  Overall, if your in the area and dig the AYCE got to try it out!!  $26 (Dinner) can't go wrong.."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here over a dozen times. Staff is wonderful & attentive. Sushi is fresh. GREAT AYCE !!!! Great atmosphere with private rooms for party's. Expect to wait for a table during peak times. I'm not the only person who will go out of my way to eat here. The Mochi Ice Cream & the nuclear bomb roll are my FAVS... Num num."}
{"text":"Best AYCE Sushi in Las Vegas!  Great prices for AYCE includes sushi, sashimi, and sides plus dessert.  The service is wonderful, the fish is fresh and tasty, and they have a wide variety of rolls."}
{"text":"*Review on specialty rolls, not nigiri  Came here twice in the last month so I guess it's review time! Both times I've recently come I've been lucky and never really had to wait for a table but by the time I'm done, it's filled up and there's a bit of a wait so I would definitely call ahead for larger parties. I'm no sushi expert & I totally understand that you're not getting some award winning fish for ayce but hey I love the rolls and variety of them here; plus almost everything tastes good with mango sauce lol.  PRICES: Lunch ayce: $21 Dinner ayce: $26  Few of my favorites:  Sexy (my #1 fave!): yum-yum scallop, cream cheese, crunch flakes, topped with eel tempura, wasabi mango sauce and eel sauce  Love Affair: shrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster, crunch flakes and masago on top  Atomic Bomb: shrimp tempura with spicy crab, and jalapeno on top inflaming hot chili sauce  Hawaiian Roll: Albacore shrimp, cucumber and avocado wrapped seared albacore with garlic ponzu  Seaweed salad: not too oily here & a lot of seaweed so an \"A\" in my book  & last but not least, THE CREME BRULEE TRIO!!!! This is what keeps me coming back to this place.The chocolate flavor is my favorite because it tastes basically like a creamy brownie but their traditional and green tea flavors are awesome as well.  Service has been good everytime I've came, water is always kept filled, and servers are pretty friendly. Also, this location is really pretty on the inside, definitely a good choice for date night."}
{"text":"So first I will say that the food is good here, but they need to be clear on the time that they close. There yelp time says open until 11:00 and they are only open until 10:00. Super inconvenient!!"}
{"text":"Usually, when I walk into a Japanese restaurant, I get the boisterous greeting from the sushi chefs and wait staff. None here. No biggie. Nice, clean-looking restaurant.  The fish tasted fresh. Ordered the tuna and super white tuna. Both were tasty. The rolls, however, I found a little disappointing. The atomic bomb was the only roll I thought was pretty good, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. The Sunrise roll I did not care for at all. It tasted like it was soaked in a garlic soy sauce. The Iris Special roll was very difficult to eat. The sauce tasted very similar to the sauce in the Sunrise roll, but it was a completely different sauce. There was a pasty, yet grainy texture to it and the flavor was pretty gross.   All in all, I don't think i'd go there again."}
{"text":"I remember why I choose other places over this one because their service is inconsistent sometimes fast sometimes slow n it doesn't matter how busy their are and the biggest one for me is I never feel gratitude from the employees there. Sushi is good I do have to say"}
{"text":"Best sushi that I ate so far since I moved here from Maui. Cool atmosphere and service are excellent. I give this place a 10... I will be back soon with wifey when she get here..Mahalo Oyshi!! You make me feel that I'm home in Maui :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. 2 blocks from my house. I would give 5 stars, but the waitress must have been new cause I have to keep asking for stuff.  Can I get a lunch menu? Can I get wasabi with my sushi? Lol. How u forget that?  I still love the food. This was the first time the severs was ok, not great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to the Rainbow location pretty often but we saw there was another location and wanted to try it out. When we got there we were seated pretty quickly, but it took a while for the waitress to acknowledge us and take our order after that point. The food was delicious as always, but the service could have been better. We will stick to the Rainbow location in the future."}
{"text":"The best All You Can Eat sushi restaurant I've ever been to by far.   At first when I came here, I wasn't expecting any thing to be that great since it's all you can eat, the food will be soso.  Was I wrong or what.  Plenty to choose from the menu! From sushi rolls to chef specialties to chocolate mochi, each dish brought out a different and wonderful flavor that automatically send me to the roof. Every single dish that was brought out were delicious and off the hooooooook. Especially the raw oysters, mmmmmm! (That's my favorite!)  One thing to keep in mind: Each time you order, be sure to order alot since the dishes come out fairly slow. Otherwise you'll finish a dish before the next one comes out."}
{"text":"Went back in October, still outstanding food and service, and  you can not beat the all you can eat price or wide variety of ordering options."}
{"text":"The only place I go to get sushi. Such high quality for ayce. They play good music and have excellent service every time I come here."}
{"text":"Great AYCE. More of a sushi fusion restaurant. Great place to take friends new to sushi. Their rolls are unique and the menu is very easy to read. The atmosphere is modern. Service is great 75% of the time. We have had a few servers that are slow and inattentive, but if you let management know they are very nice. I love the green tea tiramisu! Delicious."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place!  I did not think that an AYCE Sushi buffet would be that great since it's buffet food but they proved me wrong.  The sushi is very fresh and delicious.  The all you can eat menu has tons of food to pick from including sushi rolls, appetizers, salad, soup, uni, sweet shrimp, oysters and dessert.  You have 2 hours to eat your food which is plenty of time to enjoy and savor your meal.  The service is great and the restaurant is pretty spacious.  This is a must-visit restaurant almost every time I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Oyshi has all you can eat. A bit pricey compared to the other places I've been and not as big of a selection in terms of food outside of sushi. The creme brûlée desert was delicious, but the tiramisu did not come across as tiramisu; instead more like cheesecake."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi I've had! I was SO surprised at their huge selection for all you can eat! Not only are their rolls all you can eat... so are their appetizers :D Although they limit desserts to 1 per customer, I left completely satisfied!   The restaurant is very clean, and the environment was enjoyable. When I went, we came in a large group so they put us in the side room, so it was a little more difficult to get a hold of the waiter, but they came by often enough to keep taking our orders.   DEFINITELY will be going back when I'm in vegas!"}
{"text":"very clean.  Good food.  too bad it's so crowded now.  Worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi at an amazing price. Everything here is good and service is quick. The surf and turf roll is probably my favorite.  All you can eat sushi for the win!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit. After reading those frightening November reviews of food poisoning I was very leery about returning. I think Alice W was more angry about the service and used the F.P. card. I've never heard of a whole family getting food poisoning so take that review with a grain of salt.    My first time was good, I just did not write about it. Today I went for lunch and had a great experience. They have a few new rolls and I tried 3 of them. They were all beautifully executed and tasted great.   I'm usually not a fan of ponzu sauce but the Iris roll**** off the new menu was so good I had 2 of them. It had  Spicy albacore with cucumber, wrapped with avocado, and seared tuna. My eating partner in crime loved it.   Screaming Roll****shrimp tempura roll wrapped with yum-yum cajun albacore and avocado with garlic ponzu sauce. Flavor of cajun albacore was awesome.   Love Affair roll ***shrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster, crunch flakes and masago on top. This was good, but came in last of all the other rolls.   Asian skirt steak*** is served teriaki style on a sizzling mini skillet. It was a nice addition to sushi.  Service was better than average. I always sit at the sushi bar. Here you order from a waiter instead of directly from sushi chefs. My waiter was attentive, I had enough H2O to drink and never had to wait on food or ordering more of it.   The AYCE is $21.00 per person and well worth it. I wish they offered fried rice but there are lots of items offered on their menu.  I will return to Oyshi as it is the best sushi that is close to my house."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Vegas so far. Love the Yellow Tail Trio roll, the poke appetizer, and the creme brûlée."}
{"text":"This place gets five stars simply from being a non-buffet all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant! I tend to have slow moments so it wasn't until the end of the meal that realized that, with the exception of a few items, the whole darn menu (appetizers, soups, rolls, nigiri, tapas, and dessert) was included in one price! Lunch was less than $20 per adult, which I felt was a steal. The restaurant isn't on the strip but it's worth it for anyone visiting to venture off the beaten path for this great dining experience. Plus, it gives you the opportunity to see the residential side of things. This is now, without a doubt, one of my \"must-visit\" places when I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing. I feel like we got special treatment because we said we had never been - which was true. But they really take the time to make sure you're happy. Green tiramisu is amazing. The green tea ice cream was fabulous! The prices were even better! Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas on vacation recently and went to this restaurant based on it's Yelp ratings.  BIG MISTAKE!!! The service was slow and the sushi was awful.  It seemed like a good deal.. $21 for all you can eat sushi.  The trick, however, is that all their rolls have some sort of cream cheese or mayonnaise in it and make them so heavy and sweet tasting that you can't eat more than a few rolls.  If you like an extra helping of creamy toppings on your sushi than this place is for you.  If you prefer fresh sushi rolls the way they are supposed to be made than stay away!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like Oyshi Sushi as it was recommended to us by a couple of people. We are fans of I Love Sushi and Sushi Avenue. Unfortunately we had an experience I have never had before ... A live bug (not a roach but a lettuce Beatle) climbed out of our salad. To add insult to injury the manager did not really apologize but blamed on the people who delivered the lettuce. He said he had a similar problem with the edemame.  And as if this is not all bad enough he did not even offer to comp the one item we had eaten before the bug appeared. No class!! No sense of the customer. We will stick to I Love Sushi."}
{"text":"This place sucks now! Apparently there is a new owner which is very noticeable since the service is so bad now. I have been coming here for a few years but today was my last time since this is my second bad experience in a row. The last time I came it took over 2 hours for the first round of orders to come out for a table of 4 of us. This time the manager/owner lied to us about not having certain items and it took forever for everything to come out for our table of 8. The only good experience was our waiter-Jay"}
{"text":"AMAZING I have been going here for close to six years and it is still my favorite place in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Never thought sushi could be so good in Vegas, and it's even better with all-you-can eat!!  for $21 all-you-can eat at lunch (sashimi excluded), it's like winning the jackpot!  This place about 15 mins from the strip but worth the drive if you are craving sushi and can eat endless amts of it within 2 hours of ordering time.  The service can be a bit slow and the waiter was forgetful in some of our orders so keep ordering lots each time you see the waiter - just as long as you can eat it all.  favorites: Rattle Snakeroll, Tiger Roll, Rainbow Roll, Eel/avocado Sushi, Salmon Sushi"}
{"text":"Tonight we had dinner for the first time at Oyshi and we had an amazing time!!!!! We started at the bar with Princess while we waited for our table and she was funny and quick with service. Once sat at the sushi bar we met Chef Daniel who sent out a started that was an amazing chicken platter. The night only got better when we gave him control and he made specialty rolls all night we enjoyed every second! All of the chefs were great entertainment and very engaging. Thank you to Chefs Daniel (son), Nacho, Pedro, Jose, and Chino for a great night!!!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem.  The AYCE is not skimpy and reasonably priced.  Hawaiian rolls are my thing and theirs requires a re-order. Very nice atmosphere and decent service. I'm looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"So sad Sushi Factory closed down!! My group of 6 was looking for a buffet to eat after a fun, but exhausting day at Daylight and with it being July 4th weekend, we knew all the good buffets on the strip would have crazy waits. So, after finding out that Sushi Factory was closed, we got a recommendation from a friend to go here -- around $20 for AYCE sushi dinner, which included appetizers, rolls, nigiri, and dessert (only thing excluded was sashimi). Pretty good deal, especially for how extensive their menu is.  I wasn't really feeling like rolls, so I ordered and ate mostly nigiri -- so my 3 stars is based mostly on that. The pieces of fish were on the smaller side, and (obviously) the fish isn't the freshest you're going to find at a sushi joint (some of the uni looked a tad bit iffy, but I'm also on the paranoid side when eating raw stuff). But, if you're there more for the rolls and other items, I would probably give this place 4 stars.  Service was good, and it was easy to flag down our server whenever we wanted to order more food (which was often!)."}
{"text":"Place is really nice. Friendly staff. Very helpful! Would recommend for anyone, from kids to elders. You will not regret! -Aloha"}
{"text":"Asked if they could use a clean knife to make my wife's veggie rolls so it wouldn't be contaminated with fish. She is pregnant and her doctor said we should ask for this. Talked to two hosts and they were both rude as possible. Said they had no idea if they could use clean knifes and didn't know if they ever cleaned the knifes. Manager couldnt be bothered to help. How dumb do you have to be!! Never going here again."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with the ayce we had last night . I've been coming to oyshi since 08 and then ventured out since there was always a wait.  We decided to go last night and the fish was NOT fresh at all . The Uni being the worst - was very brown and I had to send it back . The waitress even made a comment about it.... The tuna and salmon on our rolls were off colored - not the normal vibrant red and orange fresh versions should be.   The nigiri pieces came out better - super white tuna was the best, salmon belly, and garlic tuna.  Yellowtail was off perhaps I should've asked for a different cut . Oh and they put double rice to fish ratio which is annoying and takes away from the enjoyment of the fish   All in all I was very disappointed in Oyshi's decline in quality and I won't be returning . The server was very attentive and quick . She's the reason for extra star .   LESSON: walk up to the bar and check fish quality/freshness before committing to ayce or even eating there at all !"}
{"text":"Hands down. One of my favorite sushi spots in town. This is mine and my best friend's go-to sushi spots. Sushi quality is amazing. We usually do All You Can Eat. Service is great. Sushi comes out quickly. Hands down, no complaints.  1 suggestion would be better discounts on alcohol for AYCE guests."}
{"text":"We use to come here all the time, but I will never go back. The place use to be a packed house, and now there's no wait on a Friday night and I can see why. The waiters are snobbish and rude and the manager has no backbone to stand up to them. On top of that, they super pack the rolls and sushi with rice and if you can't eat it all, they'll charge you for it. Our waiter was a fat dick (not the good kind, fat and an a$$hole) from the start of the night. He barely acknowledged us the whole night. Anytime we signaled him to order, he looked annoyed and wouldn't come over until ten minutes later. Again with the rice, the douche bag wanted to charge us $14 for not eating all the rice. WTF man, all the rice we didn't eat didn't even equal a bowl of rice they normally charge you $1 for. When we asked the manager about it, he was useless and just said, \"You don't have to tip the waiter. He doesn't expect a tip.\" After arguing about fairness and how the establishment has gone to crap, we walked out of there paying $4 extra for rice... You can have your $4 worth of rice along with the out of business sign Oyshi. Rude, snobby employees coupled with declining quality of food ain't keeping you in business much longer."}
{"text":"By far the best all you can eat sushi in town. The staff is amazing and the food is even better definitely worth the 15 minute wait. When they say it's going to be a half hour it's always sooner. We come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Best place for all you can eat sushi! The service was great and our food was delicious. The best roll I had was the dynamite roll. Ask for Ed, he's an awesome sushi chef!"}
{"text":"We expected better for the price.  Portions were relatively small and frankly not overly filling.  But the food quality was good and fresh.  I think they are still in this \"captive market\" mindset since they are the only sushi place that is walking distance from many large condo buildings.  I would rather drive to eat sushi that is much better value elsewhere.  This issue here is not the food but how I perceive value (If the cost was less or the portions larger, I would rate it a 3-4 stars)."}
{"text":"True rating is probably 3.5 but I bump up to 4 because they are always friendly.  Oyshi is a solid place to grab a quick sushi lunch or dinner. They also do take out which is a big plus given the sort of cramped seating in the restaurant (unless you're in one of the booths).  My go-to roll is the Dynamite...I know I know, so standard, but at Oyshi they put yam in it which I really enjoy and I think it goes well with the spicy salmon.  The udon is also another recommended favourite. Great for the winter months when you just want something warm!  I find portions here to be generous. One roll is enough for me - it's quite big! The udon is also very filling.  When you dine in (and maybe also when you do take out above a certain $ amount), they give you a free order of edamame."}
{"text":"My wife loves to take me to eat sushi but she hates sea food, so it's really hard to find a place that serves all you can eat sushi and a good non sushi menu.    The menu was so large, I would definitely  have to come back to try their other signature rolls. Our server Sharon  Shen was very nice she made sure to check our tables for more orders or refills and even though she was busy with other tables she still had time to make small talk.   My wife got grilled beef asparagus she wasn't sure if this place had anything she might like so she ate before we came.  That's what we usually do and then she just gets appetizers but to our surprise Oyshi  Sushi  had a decent variety of things for her to choose from.  (Good to know for Next time)"}
{"text":"Came in yesterday evening .. tried something new and it was a blast in my mouth ! Super nice servers as well"}
{"text":"Simply spectacular. First time here and I was very happy when I left. The white tuna was perfect. Vince was our server and he was so pleasant. We was so friendly and not overly present, but there before we even knew we needed him. Plates were constantly cleared from the table and the orders were brought out in a timely manner. I am definitely recommending this place to people I know. Especilally for their AYCE sushi. Two thumbs up, Oyshi!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but it bothers me that this restaurant is highly reviewed. Everyone has different idea about sushi but this place disappointed me, who is not so picky about sushi.   Wish I had the picture of the sushi that I ordered but it's been a while and unfotunately it's hard to find from thousands of pictuers I have.   This restaurant is great for people who loves \"rolls\". I enjoy rolls too but I enjoy regular nigiri sushi, which, I think, is the best way to enjoy the quality of fish. When I order Tuna nigiri, the sushi came out WET & SOGGY like the fish was just microwaved and defrosted. I do not know what caused it to be wet & soggy but I've never seen such thing in my life. Sea Urchin is not edible if they are not decent quality and this restaurant's sea urchin was not good at all.  Again, rolls are enjoyable but I don't know if  I can call this restaurant a \"good sushi restaurant\"."}
{"text":"Always good! Friendly staff and outstanding food. Go hungry & get the \"all you can eat\" special. Parking is a premium so be prepared to look for a spot."}
{"text":"Oyshi's AYCE sushi experience is kind of, well, meh.  It is neither exciting nor disappointing.  I felt that the fish to rice ratio on the nigiri was a little rice-happy.  The rolls were not too exciting.  I would go back, but only if someone else insisted."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas on March 3 and 4th and the friend I was visiting recommended this place for AYCE Sushi. I'm from Los Angeles and we have AYCE here so I couldn't imagine what the big deal was.  Well first off the price was incredible, it's a steal for what you get. There were 3 of us and we let my friend do all the ordering because she frequents here all the time. Of my memory serves me correctly we started with a Poke salad followed by 9 different sushi choices and ended with dessert. I couldn't tell you everything we ordered but the Japanese Lasagna sticks out, never had anything like it and it was so good. I don't know any place in Los Angeles that has anything close to it.  My friend is very outgoing and the waiter was great. He definitely earned his tip as often as she was calling him back for more about every 10-15 minutes.  The food here is fresh and packed full of flavor. I can't wait to come back to Vegas JUST for the sushi here. I wish your establishment much success and I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place is very special. It's the only Sushi restaurant I've been to where the chefs eat while making your food. Not a clean operation. The taste of the sushi was average, but it's distracting to have to watch cooks wiping their faces and eating food with the plastic gloves they're using to prepare your food/end rant. The server was polite and I left a tip, but I wont be coming back to this place at all. This is Vegas, there's just too many choices out there."}
{"text":"I was regular here but, probably won't be back again :( my waiter kept forgetting to bring things and i didn't have anything in order for me to eat sushi like chop sticks and wasabi and little stuff...food wasn't that great this time either I've had fresher sushi here before and it's right next to my house so it sucks but, service was bad & food was bad so, good-bye Oyshi!"}
{"text":"Just my favorite-est Sushi  spot in Vegas... Have literally brought dozens of people here over the years! Having a lot of fun  with Mikey  tonight"}
{"text":"Food is just as great as the Rainbow location and of course it would be,  I see the same sushi chefs behind the bar at this location.  More spacious than the Rainbow location definitely more tables at this location for obvious reasons. Service and food quality is always superb and at its finest. Oh and they close at midnight."}
{"text":"If I lived in Vegas I'd eat here at least 3 times a week! Big portions! The food is so good! Service was super fast! It's  cheap!! $23 all you can eat lunch! I left here full and happy! Highly recommend! Don't over order like we did' we were stuffing our face!"}
{"text":"Here is my review:  HMMMMMMM HMM HMMM HMM WHEEEE"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great and friendly team of servers! Did the AYCE and what a bargain...7 different rolls, eel, and beers! Some of these AYCE sushi places fill in the rolls with extra rice but not here...These were well done, creative combinations of flavor, texture, and presentation as well! Love it...Happy New Years!!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi bar.  The fish has always been good so far and the variety of what is included for all you can eat can't be beat.  Find me another place that includes green tea tiramisu and chocolate creme brule in their all you can eat menu and I'll think about changing my alliegence."}
{"text":"I'm so lucky to have such an amazing sushi place so close to home. They have an all you can eat that is very reasonable and I always over do it. I just can't help myself, the food is so good!! Nice casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and ever since then we love coming here. The staff is friendly and fast service! I love how it looks inside very modern. We can't find a place that's better then this place. They have quality fish for a great price!"}
{"text":"From someone that hated sushi, I've learned that's it's all in how it's prepared....Oyshi Sushi converted me into someone that can't get enough now!  The place is always busy, and the crowd is very diverse.    Waiters are good at suggesting items if you're not too sure, and the menu offerings are plentiful.  Only once did I attempt AYCE....but my stomach wouldn't allow any more after the 3rd dish. But if you can, go for it...very affordable."}
{"text":"I've had the worst experience. The service was quite slow and our dishes were not removed. We came for the AYCE and the dishes from our first order were still on the menu. We were charged 18% gratuity as a party of 5, despite the menu said that that only parties of 8 or more would be charged the 18% gratuity. The service was not worth this, and I didn't not want to pay for the gratuity, and instead of feeling concerned the waitress just said \"oh sorry about that\" with such a lack of emotion. Worst service, average food. Definitely better sushi spots in Vegas."}
{"text":"I come for lunch special. 12 bucks gets you soup,salad,cal roll, tempura plate, and stir fried meat dish (chicken,beef,or shrimp ) with veggies. All freshly prepared. Nicely decorated.  A good deal!  American pop music too loud, would like something a bit more ethnic and softer.  The food and service is 5 star though, so that's what I'll give them."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best sushi places in town and I have sampled many places. The spicy tuna crunch had the perfect amount of crunch and spice.  The service was prompt and very friendly! Thinking of making this place a weekly stop!"}
{"text":"came in last night with my boyfriend and one of our friends they had all you can eat and I just had some of the tapas. The food was amazing as usual but the server was extremely rude she took so long to come back for our orders and rarely checked up on us. I've always had very good experiences here but last night was not one of them. we shouldn't have had to wait so long for our server to come back and check on us. Several times other servers were the ones to take the orders."}
{"text":"Came in pretty late and was sat right away! We tend to sit at the bar because my boyfriend likes to order half rolls. The chefs were very attentive as was our server. This is my go to spot and I recommend both locations to everyone! Very clean and super fast!"}
{"text":"servers should know what their guests order. my table only had 5 people. it's not like I'm asking you to remember what belongs to who because it's reasonable to not be able to remember that. I ordered the most simple order out of all my friends, which was 3 orders of masago and 1 order of uni with quail egg. My friends ordered actual rolls(such as volcano roll) that take forever to make and they finished all their food they ordered which was more than 15 different full sushi rolls. I had to tell the server to check on my food twice to actually get acknowledged. I then asked do you even know what we are missing ? and he was about to walk off not even knowing what order he's going to go check on. I will never come back or recommend this place again. I used to be a regular here and now it's ridiculously bad customer service. I already didn't want to come here but I was content with the service last time. it was neither good or too bad. you need to hire new servers."}
{"text":"The sushi is awesome but this update is mostly for the service:  unfortunately, i did not catch our servers names but.... everytime I go, he's usually there.  Both servers were incredibly nice and despite it being close to closing time, they were very upbeat! We didn't finish all the sushi for all you can eat but they allowed us to take it home. We just had to pay for another roll. Not a bad deal!"}
{"text":"I went there last night with my family and a friend for my wife's birthday. Ryan, our waiter, was very honest and friendly. He did everything he could to make sure our experience was as pleasant as possible and did a great job. We would definitely be coming back  The food quality was excellent, especially the shrimp tempura Yum!"}
{"text":"Wow this place was definitely the best AYCE sushi I've ever had. First of all, the selection is AMAZING and overwhelming. It is a great deal for 21 dollars. Trust me and order the following items and you will be one satisfied customer with your belly about to explode.   I will start off with the non-rolls food: Must get the surf and turf, ahi poke, sashimi salad, skirt steak, grilled asparagus and beef. There were a few other items that I would like to try next time. There were simpy so freaking many. For rolls, try the Nuclear Bomb Roll, Lobster Fair, Paradise Roll, and oh what the heck, just try everything! For desert, you definitely have to try the green tea tiramisu.   The service was also great and very attentive. They will make great recommendations based off of your tastes. So trust me, if you're in Vegas, give this place a try."}
{"text":"I am still in love with this place!! Since it was just me and a friend, we opted for first available seating Nd that ended up being at the bar. It's a while new environment when you sit at the bar! If it's just you and a friend, I recommend sitting at the bar. If it's you and your family or a large group, stick to a table. But I do recommend experiencing the bar when you can.   By sitting at the bar, you are face to face with the sushi chefs. You may order your rolls directly from them and if you are daring, you can just have them make rolls for you without necessarily going off the menu (AYCE guests only, I'm guessing). Since it was the first time sitting at the bar for both of us, we didn't know that was possible until we had already ordered the world and we were just about bursting at the seams. We did try a fatty tuna sushi though which was basically made with tuna belly. It was sooooooo good!!   We also had a bottle of lychee sake. It came in a wine sized bottle, but we decided to take shots of it. It was so yum and it basically tasted like juice. Which is dangerous because it had the same alc vol as wine, and my friend and I finished the bottle like it was nothing!   Here are a few things that I think would be great to keep in mind while you're here:  -if you and a friend are looking to hang out, enjoy great food, and be social, definitely sit at the bar and have the chefs make you whatever your heart desires  -it's all you can eat, so definitely come here with an empty stomach and be prepared to eat the world! BUT...on busy nights, the wait can be awhile and if you come here super hungry, once you're seated, you'll want to order everything at once! This may not be a good thing, cuz if you're anything like us, you'll stuff your face and be done within 30 minutes.  -if you're paying with multiple cards, make sure the person taking your payment knows what exactly is going on what card. Although  we thought that we were clear in our instructions, she still managed to charge the wrong amount! (I'm not sure if this girl just wasn't paying attention or just wasn't having it because it was so busy, but I remember she was also being a bit rude when she was calling people for their tables)"}
{"text":"Slow service. I'll also call up to 10 times literally and no answer for to go orders. Not the first time they don't answer their phone."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this location to open because I live a lot closer to this location. I always sit at the head chef NYI side. NYI and the manager always comes by and always makes us feel welcome. The food is always good!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years... tonight we drove out of our way after checking your hours on google. We arrive at 10:05 PM and your server told us last call was five minutes prior.  If we knew you didn't honor your hours shown on yelp and Google(11PM) we wouldn't have drove all the way up there. Teach your employees manners, you shouldn't turn away paying customers 55 minutes before you close"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Las Vegas!! Great atmosphere, and fresh quality food! I'm very picky when it comes to sushi restaurants and finally found the one! OYSHI is the spot for the best sushi!!! I went to the Sahara location."}
{"text":"One of my fave sushi restaurants! I love the service, quality food and its very fresh. The menu is on point. I really have nothing bad to say. I've been a few times, and both times were on point. Its worth the trip."}
{"text":"I went to oyshi for lunch on a Friday and was immediately seated. The ambiance was beautiful.  The food was really good with a wide selection of rolls . I love how the customize what goes on the rolls if you ask . The nigiri was really fresh but I've had better. What really stood out for me was the desserts   Our server Julia was the bomb ! She was really friendly and answered all of the questions I had . Although she was quite busy , she still kept tabs on us and made sure our drinks were always full and our tables were cleared .   Oyshi is definately a place you want to check out , from the food to the amazing service."}
{"text":"Oyshi has AYCE appetizers you can't find at any other AYCE sushi place. The beef asparagus, skirt steak, rib eye, and a few other things are unique to oyshi. Beef asparagus is especially tasty. The rolls are similar to what to get anywhere else. So is are the nigiri. I think the bonsai roll is very good. Spicy tuna inside with Cajun albacore outside. Probably the best roll we had. The biggest thing is the green tea creme brûlée. No other AYCE sushi place has this. It is so good!!!! Without it I'd probably give 3 stars. But the green tea creme brûlée alone is worth 1 stat!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good.. but the staff seems not so happy on their job.. the whole time that we were eating we didn't see a single smile.. place is good a little pricey but it fine.. i don't think we'll come back here.."}
{"text":"The AYCE sushi here is unbelievable!! It's the best I've had in the city and I'm an avid sushi goer! The fish are fresh and miso soup is unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Great all you can eat price. Tons of fresh fish with as fast as they are going through it.  Amazing selection of rolls. I had to take a picture of the menu to give to my sushi chef back home so he can recreate them.  The Japanese Lasagna with Garlic if fantastic! Definitely come back here on my next trip through Vegas!"}
{"text":"Been here twice & have loved it ! The service is awesome & so is the food. Waitress are helpful in ordering different kind of rolls."}
{"text":"Honestly if this review was based solely on the taste of the food it would probably get 5 starts but the service was sooooooo bad both times I was there. First of all they sat us at a dirty table and said they would have someone come clean it. Took 5 mins for someone to get there. Another 5 minutes for someone to take our drink orders. Now this is beyond me 5 minutes went by before my friends sprite hit the table and another 5 minutes for my coke. Why on earth they didnt come at the same time is beyond me and why it would 10 ten minutes pisses me off even more. We ordered a couple roles and some salads. The salads came and we ate them and then sat there and sat there for about 15 minutes before we could even get someones attention to say hey whats happened??  They must have known how shitty they were with out me even complaining becase when the rolls finally did come they told us the salads would be complimentary due to the lack of service. That is only reason they get 2 stars instead of one. Regardless after two shitty service experiences I have no interest in returning."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now because of how close it is to the house. Food is definitely decent here but the service is so slow that Oyshi is almost painful for me to dine at. One time it took almost 15 minutes for me just to get the check and it wasn't even that busy. Service is important to me, but if you have 2 hours to kill on a 1 hour dinner, by all means."}
{"text":"I love Oyshi Sushi! Some All You Can Eat sushi places have a separate menu for what you can and cannot order- not here. you can order right off the menu (with the exception of sashimi, that is not included). They have a large variety of rolls and sushi. I have tried many of them and they are all delish! There is usually a wait, but its never outrageous and the staff is always super friendly whenever I go."}
{"text":"Is it cool that I like the interior design and art better than the food?  Just kidding.  I started out with miso soup and popcorn scallops.  The scallops were okay and it came with two sauces; some kinda mustard and I believe ranch.  Otherwise the fried scallops alone didn't have too much flavor or spice like wasabi batter or something.  Didn't meet my expectations but I dealt with it.  Eating it took me a while, but it gave me enough time to chat with Kat and her hubs about the restaurant ambience :P  This is the 3rd restaurant that I've found to have AYCE.  Nice foldable menu and good basic selections.  Salmon belly nigiri was good.  I found their fish to be on the dry side for the other nigiris as served.  Cool thing is their portions are bite size.  For my main roll I ordered the Love Affair... oooouuuu SO NOT sexyyyy either.  It looked like a mound of imitation crab mixed with crispies and lobster bits dumped on top of the cut rolls, hiding beneath the chaos.  But the flavor was good.  Nice that the restaurant has space for larger groups and separate dining areas.  The tall ceilings, creative wood designs, lighting, and paint art captured my attention the most.  Just to note too, walking into any Japanese restaurant I'm used to being greeted by the chefs or workers.  Here they have it modernly designed on the entrance wall - no joyous welcoming shouts...  Our waiter had a tiny misunderstanding with our separate tabs.  Also took a couple reminders for drink refills.  I shall end my review with a fair nod.  I might come back however it will not be my first choice for AYCE.  I wanted to have a taste of their green tea creme brulee.  Mission accomplished and I will say that their green tea creme brulee by itself is deserving of 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place's not bad. I just feel like their food taste like any other place. The price is good for the amount you eat. I'd ordered the spider roll, crunchy scallop, seaweed salad and green tea. Those aren't good cooked dishes."}
{"text":"Ok here come the Vegas reviews...yes, it's down the street from my house. Yes, it gets crowded. If you bring more than 4 friends, go off-time, meaning AFTER THE LUNCH CROWD or BEFORE THE DINNER CROWD, especially on weekends.   Or split your party up but sit near each other. Trust me this is how you won't have to wait and salivate while others are dining and taking their time. (Just kidding) But seriously, like every other Yelper, it is a good deal.   Highly popular with everybody. Highly."}
{"text":"The best AYCE sushi in Vegas at an affordable cost! They have every roll you can possibly think of and their selection of sushi is pretty good. They always provide quick and friendly service. Beware: if you go on the weekends, expect a wait. Rest assure, they work hard on turning tables quickly so your wait is not painfully long."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Restaurant never got my order from the app apparently. Even when shown the receipt for the exact order with the order number on it and still being charged, they wouldn't give me my food. They then tried telling me that it might have been ordered to a different restaurant when it was be exact same address.  I can assure you there's a lot better sushi spots in town if you're not restricted to the more SW side of town. Be cautious of Oyshi."}
{"text":"My first time in this sushi place. It was great atmosphere. We ordered all of the spacial sushi, it was good except there salmon that I feel it was't sweet. Service was good."}
{"text":"This place has ALL-U-CAN-EAT sushi!!!! And the menu for that option is pretty sweet! It's been awhile since I've been here, but every roll i tasted was delish!  The portions are good and two rolls filled me up fast (so no I did not do the all-u-can-eat option! LoL) I think here and Kaizen have the best rolls in Vegas....for now atleast! And the decor is pretty modern and stylish so I especially enjoyed eating here! ;)"}
{"text":"When I arrived to this place, I noticed how awesome it looked! It was pretty and spacious. I ordered the baked salmon, baked tuna, and sexy roll. The egg rolls were so delicious! Our server really liked to hustle- she asked if we wanted anything else multiple times, haha! There were 5 of us and we ended up paying $30 each not too bad for sushi!"}
{"text":"I like this location better than than rainbow location. Customer service is excellent, and the waiters are so nice! The wait is never long and the food is amazing! I drive from across town to eat at this location!"}
{"text":"Use to be my favorite spot in town for sushi but over the last two years I had twice food poisonining from the raw sushi.3 stars because I am sure they can bring it back to what it was a very nice clean place to get your sushi."}
{"text":"Horrible dining experience.  Service was extremely slow. Ayce sushi but I got full with hot tea waiting for the slow food. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I love the original location. Today's service sucked.   We came in a few months ago to try the new location again. Looking forward to uni with quail egg, we were disappointed they were out. It was incredibly cold (I know this has nothing to do with the service).   Driving by today we decided to stop again. Got seated right away which was nice. Our server asked our drink order but by that time we were ready to order. She did not want to take our order since another customer was waiting for something. So we got our waters and waited. She came back to take our order and things already went wrong. We ordered beef tataki but got beef wrapped asparagus. Ordered another beef wrapped asparagus but got nothing. Ordered uni but they were out... again. Ordered three orders of gyoza but got two. Ordered three seaweed salads but got two. Ordered a dynamite roll and a lobster affair roll but got two lobster affair rolls. Ordered three pork belly and got one. Ordered a red dragon roll and got a regular dragon roll. The salmon nigiri was warm and did not taste fresh. We ordered the Oyshi scallops which had crab also, but when we got the order there was no scallop. I called over a food runner and sent it back. The server came back and aggressively asked us if we had ordered cooked scallops. It's like she couldn't remember anything even though she wrote it down. We said there were no scallops and she said they were chopped and mixed with the crab. It was a lie. I looked through it. Besides, no one minces scallops.   It is unreasonable to pay more for dinner prices when they are out of items only offered for dinner, like uni. This is the third time we have been to this location and all three times they did not have uni. I will never come back."}
{"text":"This place is always top notch! Typical to have a short wait.  Have had multiple rolls and all are delicious. Hardest debate is whether to order by the roll or go all you can eat. In the end, best deal is the all you can eat just prepare to leave stuffed.  My wife isn't a big fan of sushi and she always orders the ribeye. She loves it (I've tried it and it is glorious as well)!!!  Recently saw they have other locations in town which is always a plus! Try here...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love love love Oyishi!   The atmosphere is modern, clean, and always plays the best Pandora Stations! I have been going here for years and have seen it change over time physically, however the food is consistent - and that's why I go back!   It's located on Rainbow and Windmill which is literally less than a two minute drive from where I live. It's super convenient - the southwest area is developing like crazy so make sure to call ahead and make sure there's a table for you if you have a big group. Sometimes you have a wait a bit to get seated even for 2 people on a high volume day, but if call ahead it shouldn't be a problem. They've been improving seating people right away I have noticed the past few times. Prices are affordable and they also offer all you can eat. They have a private parking lot too.   Also, during the weekdays they have an awesome lunch special. I ordered their chicken teriyaki which was a generous serving with a California roll, miso soup, vegetable/shrimp tempura, and a house salad all for $12!!!! Who wouldn't be stoked about that?   Overall, this place is great. I recommend to anyon"}
{"text":"Keep coming back and this last time was back to the Oyshi we knew before. The food was great and staff was outstanding. My only concern is their choice of music if you're bringing family or children. That's minor."}
{"text":"LATE NIGHT SUSHI AT ITS BEST (At least, from what I've tried so far)  I usually don't get off until 11:15 at night, and by that time, most sushi bars in Vegas have already packed it in and called it a night, or are shortly about to. Not Oyshi! Thankfully, this place stays open until 2AM (last call at 1:30 AM) and is perfect for folks working in the entertainment industry in Vegas.  The All-You-Can-Eat option is $27 at this place, and it is worth it! Though not as great as other AYCE places I have dined in, it still boasts a wide selection of rolls and hot food.   I think my favorite roll was the Yellowstone Roll, which was an interesting Spicy Tune and Whitefish concoction that was topped with yum-yum sauce, jalapeno and CHEDDAR CHEESE. I haven't ever been to a place with cheddar cheese as a sushi topping.  I do wish that the dessert was all you can eat as well, because I would have like two mochi balls instead of 1, but that's a small gripe.  The alcohol did seem relatively expensive. My buddy had a Sapporo and it was $7 or $8. That almost seems obscene.  On a positive note, Dad is not a huge sushi fan, so he opted for the Teriyaki Chicken Dinner. For $11, hhe had a Miso Soup, a Salad, a bowl of white rice and a HUGE steaming hot plate FULL of chicken teriyaki with hardly any vegetables. It was a fantastic deal!"}
{"text":"This rather nondescript sushi restaurant would've never caught my eye had it not been a friend's recommendation. Oyshi's sign looks like any other Japanese restaurant but once you step inside and sit yourself in a warmly-lit booth, it's quite a lovely experience. Great for long catch-up sessions! Plus, I love that they provide clothing hangars!  Oyshi Sushi's unagi don is delicious. It is served in a black lacquered bento box with pickled radish (\"oshinko\") on the side. The unagi meat was tender and the sushi rice (\"shari\") was of good quality. Very solid dish worthy of a repeat-order. Healthy rice/unagi ratio priced in-line with most restaurants (~$20.00 incl tax).   This restaurant gives you complimentary roasted tea and edamame beans to munch on as you wait for your food. I also had an order of their yellowtail sashimi (\"hamachi\"). Fresh and tasty.  This restaurant seems to have its share of regular customers that drop-by to dine in-house or to pick-up their orders. If you're in the area and want decently priced Japanese food, try Oyshi."}
{"text":"The food was fine, but I just don't get all the hype.  The food is far from complain-worthy, but, why would I eat here when i can go to Kobe Bistro and pay half as much for the exact same fish!?  Kobe is great and is almost always 50% off (they also have ayce).     Oyshi is good, but quite expensive."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Las Vegas. Best Service in Las Vegas. Best Atmosphere in Las Vegas. Best all you can eat sushi in Las Vegas. Best friendly staff in Las Vegas. Best Sake in Las Vegas. Best beer in Las Vegas. Best Salmon in Las Vegas - my favorite dish. Best appetizers in Las Vegas. Best music while eating Sushi. Will I go anywhere else for Sushi in Las Vegas? No. I drive to Oyshi from all corners of Vegas because why? It's simply the best. Best of Las Vegas. Best of Las Vegas. Best of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night. It was busy so that just about all the tables were taken, but there wasn't a ridiculous wait. We had a really large party here, so we reserved a separate dining room to accommodate for all of us. Their service was really great. Food came out pretty fast and the waiters are friendly and are very attentive to your needs.   The quality of the nigiri was just OK. It wasn't horrible, but it didn't particular stand out. The proportion or rice to fish is average. They give you more rice than some better places I've been to, which tends to fill you up. Also the quality of the fish wasn't great either. It was fresh, but with certain cuts of fish, you can generally taste a difference in quality from the texture. The rolls were pretty good, but they generally are at any AYCE place. None of it seems to stand out, but I rarely see that anyways.   One of things I got that usually well judges the quality of a place was the uni and a salmon skin roll. The uni was ok. Usually a good piece of uni will have that buttery texture, which this one didn't. This one also had more of a soapy taste, which is generally from uni that isn't as fresh or good quality. The salmon skin hand roll: a good one will have nice, crispy, crunchy pieces of salmon skin. But the ones I ordered here were crunchy and moist, meaning that they didn't toast it long enough to get that right texture.  Overall, it was ok. It was about $26 a person for dinner, which is pretty typical. I've already found some other better AYCE sushi places in Vegas, so I probably wouldn't come back here unless someone really wanted to."}
{"text":"Oyshi is right around the corner from where I reside so of course I'm gonna try it! Well this place rocks! Great service and and an always friendly staff. We always ask for Stacy if she is working and she has never let us down! I recommend the J&B roll as well as any of the tempura rolls...the baked mussels are amazing too! I highly recommend AYCE...worth every penny ;)"}
{"text":"We would love to give a detailed review of our experience however we never even made it to our seats. We walked in at 9pm and asked for a table for 2 and we were informed they decided to close early today..... 90 minutes early. WHO DOES THAT?????  Good menu or not, there's zero tolerance in this town for subpar service like this.   Scratching this place off our book of great places to go! #serviceisking"}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars, because i honestly believe this is the best buffet/Ayce for the price in Vegas. I have gone to this place for almost 3 years now. The best part about this place are the appetizers. I love the Shrimp on skewers, Rib Eye, Asian Skirt Steak, Ahi Poke, Gyoza, and many more....Over the years their portions have gotten smaller, but i understand because it prevents from wasting food..BTW you can always get more....Their fresh sushi is amazing as well, big pieces of fish with small rice, and their Baked Rolls are very tasty. my favorites is the Lobster Fair and the Paradise rolls. Word of advice try to get there early around 5 for dinner, or you can expect a long wait. Service is really good, and ambiance is great with a younger japanese themed feel....Oyshi is the only reason my wife wants to go to Vegas..."}
{"text":"I'm laying down in my bed right now and moaning. I'm alone, laying here, moaning. Get that visual out of your head.  As good as it gets for AYCE. Really good quality, really good price, incredible service, good ambiance. Basically just like The Ka over in Henderson, but closer to the area I'm in.  Excellent white tuna sashimi, really really good eel.   Unghhhhhhhhhh."}
{"text":"If you are a sushi snob, hit back on your browser and get a plane ticket to LA at least if not Tokyo. Las Vegas as far as I have seen as two sushi options... Buffet and the type of place you are subsidizing comped high rollers.   Oyshi is the buffet type. $21 for lunch. $26 for dinner. I did not notice anything different between the two menus. The $5 vig is likely pure the night vig.   Your options include sushi, rolls and hot dishes. Each is worth a paragraph.   Sushi. Most AYCE places save $$$ by not offering albacore, ikura, scallops, uni and other such high end items. This is not the case for Oyshi, which makes me wonder where they cut corners. That being said, I believe the sushi is the highlight of the menu. Though the rice is not prepared to sushi standards, the rice portion is fairly small compared to the fish, so this does not take away too much from the bite. The actual fish itself is pretty good considering it is AYCE. Note that each order is a fairly small two pieces, so don't be shy about ordering a lot. Do eat the rice as well, though, as you will be penalized for going no-carbs.   Rolls. Of the spider, bonsai, ebi ebi and volcano, I only liked the last two. I think the issue here is the sauces are pretty hit and miss. I think that AYCE places try to make their rolls filling, salty and sweet to induce satiation or in the case of bonsai nausea. That roll actually made me heave a little. Don't order too many rolls. It is sort of like how most of the menu is rolls like casinos mostly place slot machines on the casino floor. It's the most profitable.   Last and definitely least is the appetizer menu. All the meat items suck. The beefs are stringy and sweet sauced up to disguise their cheapness and the chicken is dry. Don't waste gut space. If you wanted a nice surf and turf combo, you should be at a fine steakhouse. I was disappointed, but having a good appetizer menu at an AYCE sushi place would just be a bonus. I think some of the non-meat stuff is fairly safe, such as the miso soup (though don't expect the world).   Drinks. Didn't sample the alcohol, but you have your usual assortment of sake and beer. Since I was there for lunch and was still tired from the previous night's drive, I passed. Tea is $2.50 in case you wanted to know and is pretty good to share since it is a flat fee for one pot with free hot water refills.   Though Oyshi is in a strip mall on a nondescript corner of the Vegas suburbs, it wants you to think that you are in Caesar's Palace. Not necessarily a bad thing.   There are two back rooms to accommodate large groups. Lunch is fairly quiet. I would expect dinner to be loud with the drinking and the karaoke.   Services is good during lunch. Attentive and even proactive about making sure you order a lot. Nice.   Overall, it is a good value at $21. This continually justifies my urge to stay away from the Strip for dining. Just don't expect tsukiji quality or anything and enjoy the relatively cheap eats."}
{"text":"This place is owned by the same oyshi on rainbow and robin dale in the southwest, so naturally I thought it would be pretty good. Unfortunately like my carnal lust for orgasmic sushi I was left disappointed and a bit unsatisfied. Having said that it wasn't all that bad. The fantasy roll, heart attack roll and a classic remix a crazy Cali roll were great. The one roll that was a huge disappointment was the Ian special. As for sides the ginger didn't taste fresh at all or the wasabi. The service was very spotty, the server forgot to refill my water quite a few times and the Resturant wasn't even that busy. The ambience is decent and nice. Not to ostentatious or to subtle but a nice complement to setting the mood right for a memorable night out.   All in all the place is average at best in terms of price and service. The plus point and a huge reason to return is the roll have a new fresh take on them and many of sound good to try, there is too many to try by yourself. Bring 7 people with you on your quest for something new and exciting. Some rolls will be forgettable kind of like their service but others will leave you lost in a sea mind numbing, thought altering perception. Definite place to try if you are up for something new."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and place for AYCE. I've been to both locations many times and was never disappointed. I'm reviewing the one on Rainbow. Parking is pretty full most of the time because Oyshi shares it's location with other restaurants. If you plan on going on peak hours, good luck finding parking! There's a big selection of rolls to pick from and you get a lot, so come hungry!  I ordered the sukiyaki once and it was super good. Hit the spot. :)"}
{"text":"Sashimi is not included in the AYCE. Honestly I'd rather pay $8 more somewhere else that includes it. Not very many options for AYCE in my opinion. No smoke salmon :(. Service was pretty good around lunch time!"}
{"text":"Became violently ill after eating here, barely enough time to make it home. Friendly, efficient service. Lots of young people in trucker hats and beanies. Not a lot of asian dinners. Sashimi/rolls tasted odd. Just kind of shrugged it off. Win some lose some when it comes to AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Good service whenever my family of six go we always get seated quickly and served right away. Most of the servers are nice there was this one time when one of them was rude but besides that its always calm ,friendly ,and yummy place."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great price for all you cat eat!!! Good customer service! All around a great place to eat out!"}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorite spots. Really disappointed in the service. Our food came before we even had a place setting or utensils etc, ordered all you can eat and our waitress only came around that first time to take our order. They are incapable of handling a busy crowd, I would highly recommend going to the rainbow location. I have given this particular location 3 tries hoping it would be better and they prove me wrong each time."}
{"text":"We have been here many times and each time has been more epic and delicious then the last but on this visit Stefan was the man anticipation, suggestions, The small convo breakers to comment and joke were just amazing he suggest certan items we never knew about like the takisoba and pork belly both good suggestion. Keep working Stefan up he would be amazing and Suggestion add a long sliver of lemon across the squid with shiso leaf it makes that little peace over the top. Stefan your experience and charisma have shown this 10+ year waiter that te trade isnt dead"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, but the service....the service is terrible!!!!! The hostess was a complete bitch and laughed when we asked to sit at a preferred table. She said they are reserved for larger parties (we are a party of 3)....it made us upset because a party of 3 was at the exact table. Ordered a rainbow roll at 6:30pm and at 7:50pm we asked where is was. They had no clue so 15 minutes later we received the roll. It took 30 minutes to even get a water!!! Everyone around us was complaining and the whole atmosphere was a downer. Food was good, but I would rather get sushi from the grocery store then deal with this bs. P.s...they leave a pitcher of water on the table...not to be nice...it's because it's too difficult for them to even refill a water"}
{"text":"Been coming to Oyshi for years... food is great and as usual with sushi places- if you don't eat at the bar, service can be slow during busy times. This place has one of the best ranges of foods to eat on their AYCE menu, so it's a good place to go if you have someone in your part who doesn't prefer raw fish."}
{"text":"This is a must place to dine when in Vegas. I've been coming here for years and it's never let me down. Bring your appetite because everything is delicious.  My favorites include; sizzling plates-rib eye, poke salad, salmon skin roll (handroll), baked mussels and the Monster roll.  The staff are always great and attentive. The wait can be long but it's well worth it.  Did I mention that dessert is included in the All You Can Eat (AYCE)? Also delicious. I recommend the Creme Brûlée."}
{"text":"My wife and i have eaten at several sushi places around vegas and we keep coming back here. There is a reason. Creative chefs, great atmosphere, and we have never had bad service.. It's awesome"}
{"text":"Highly recommended from a fellow Yelper and also a dear friend who is a Vegas resident and an expert on ayce sushi bars who even made rotd on such, what can go wrong.  He was right.  This place is awesome.    The locals know where to eat.  And its not on the strip with over priced and under flavored eats.  Its far away from it HA!  The place is well decorated.  Very modern.  Very clean.  However, you don't get the true, authentic feel of a real japanese sushi bar.  But their ways was cool too :)  Anyway,  their fish was above average as far as freshness.  Their rice was tastey but couldve been a little bit more warmer.    I love the fact that they didn't make their nigiri with so much rice like other places would.  That was a plus:)  I'm not a fan of rolls.  However, my company tonight ordered a few rolls.  I prefer strictly nigiri.  But the ones my friend chose was actually ok.  My friend always takes us out to his spots.  He is totally my go to guy for good eats here in sin city.  He hasn't disappoint:)"}
{"text":"This place is a really nice spot to go for a nice  lunch with friends or  for a dinner for two. They are usually playing the top 50 charts over the radio and their staff has the young, hip, friendly vibe  They have an all you can eat menu that's $22 for lunch and $27 for dinner (I think that's for weekends). I usually stick with that because 2 specialty rolls alone would equal to the price of AYCE.   I went for a friend's birthday and we shared all kinds of yummy appetizers, this really tasty sake and of course all of our rolls.  Everything was fresh and tasted pretty good. I would suggest the atomic bomb, pretty spicy but really good. I couldn't take a picture fast enough because it was devoured in seconds.   My only wish is that they had more options with spicy mayo or ponzu sauce. They had a lot of rolls topped with eel sauce which  is not my go to but it's doable."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Just because we had a big party and gratuity is automatically on the bill, doesn't mean you treat the customers with the worst service. Where shall I begin. First it took us 30 minutes just to get water for a party of 15.  Second, when they bring out the orders they just place it on the corner of the table nearest to their entry and expect us to sort it out to whoever ordered it. Third, they just keep doing that and expect us to make room on the table instead of cleaning out our table which was a total mess because of all the empty plates on the table.  Did runners were rude. Just the worst I have ever seen compared to our other parties we had at sushi spots.  I feel our gratuity shouldn't have been automatically added after that service. Stay away from this place is you got a party."}
{"text":"My go to spot for AYCE sushi. Staff is friendly and really good at making rounds to see if there's anything else you'd like to order. Drinks are never empty. Food comes out quick and always on point."}
{"text":"Flavorless Gyoza, overcooked beef wrapped asparagus, and slow service. That about sums up my visit here."}
{"text":"\"I'm STARVING! waited 34 mins AFTER gettin seated just to flag a different waiter to take our All You Can Eat sushi order. This place used to be my favorite sushi spot but the service sticks out the most (above the food) and this place really went to the gutter.\""}
{"text":"This is for the all-you-can-eat lunch for $21. They make it fresh as you order and is not premade, nor is it buffet-style, which I love. A plethora of selections from hand rolls, sushi, appetizers- hot and cold, and cooked sushi ( didn't order any, personal Preference ). Uni is not included during lunch. Quality is great. I dined at the newer location which is nicely decorated with modern touches, semi-private rooms are also available. Service is good. Not a lot of people for lunch on a weekday but maybe because it's at the new location. Would come back here!"}
{"text":"A perfectly good sushi place if you happen to work in the area. I probably wouldn't head out of my way but given the fact that I'm a vegetarian and pretty limited in what I can have sushi wise, that's sort of a given.  I've dined in a couple of times and grab it for takeout on occasion when I feel like something different.   Sit down service is about the same as most places, service is attentive and they'll usually give you some edamame beans or something (on the house) to munch on while you wait. The place is a little cozy but nice.  My take out choice (basically my only option) is their vegetarian futomaki lunch special ($8.95). You get 8 generously sized pieces along with a particularly good miso soup and one of those little Japanese salads they always give you. Pretty standard for downtown and again, the quality of the ingredients is good and the roll well done.  Friendly, fast and tasty. Win, win, win."}
{"text":"For the $2X price of lunch or dinner AYCE sushi this place is really not too shabby!  Basically everything on the menu minus the sashimi's on the menu are obtainable for the AYCE deal just make sure you can finish everything you order, or pay the price. I liked the fact that the fish was actually cold to the touch when I was eating the rolls and what not...it gives me the false sense that it's fresher. Like most AYCE if you have a big appetite it becomes a better deal for you but if you can only stomach two rolls max, might be better off ordering off the menu and skipping on the deal."}
{"text":"Generally, I wouldn't recommend a place if I wanted to keep it a secret. I would say something like, the place sucks and not to go there. I thought about it, but then then it might backfire and the place closes down. Therefore...  Yes, I am a big fan. I'm not the biggest sushi lover as some people are, but when it's good, it's good. I do believe I've had a wide enough sample of restaurants to know the difference. This place is definitely a place I would recommend.   The place is cool, kind of a drive from the strip, middle of nowhere strip mall with tumble weed crossings, inside is not TOO fancy, and not TOO much the other kind. But really you don't need to care much, as long as it's clean.  The place is all you can eat, not all you can pay for. More like... You can eat all, for one set price (within two hours). Three of the four pages of the menu are all included for that price. And let me tell you, they had every roll I've ever seen or heard of along with many many more that I haven't. But there are also all the wonderful appetizers like the Rib Eye and Shrimp called \"Surf and Turf\" tucked all the way on the last page at the very end. Ya we ordered about 8 of those. That alone, would probably be worth the price.   Between the seven of us we ordered more sushi than I could ever imagine. But it wasn't so much about the quantity but the quality was just as impressive. Of the different rolls I did try. I had, not one complaint. They were as good as I've had at any other Sushi restaurant. I'd go into the names and ingredients of the rolls but if you love sushi, and even if you don't just imagine the ones you like and it's probably on the menu.  Service was pretty good considering how many people were eating all you can eat sushi in the restaurant. I really did expect the sushi to come out one every half hour. But I didn't even notice any wait between drinks, appetizers, sushi, more sushi, more appetizers and finally dessert. In fact, upon ordering an extra Miso soup, It seemed like it got to the table before I finished ordering it. They were that fast.  Eating good food releases endorphins in your brain. A good sign that you just had a good meal with good friends is how much everyone is laughing at the end. And there was plenty of that to be had for everyone. The only reason Its not 5 stars, is because I've had some really good Sushi, but I can't order it here because it's usually a Chef Special at the other places.  By the way, this place sucks."}
{"text":"Not the first time being at Oyishi but after today this will be my last.  We were seated within five minutes of our arrival; however we had to ask for service after waiting 25 minutes. The waitress who was assigned to our table was very pleasant and apologetic.  We placed our orders but people  from  our party did not receive their complete  sushi order for 2hrs. The waitress again was apologetic and placed it  on rush.  The one star is for this waitress if it wasn't for her we would have walked out."}
{"text":"My mom & I eat at Oyshi every now & then, when we go there we order the same thing every time. Just recently my mom & I decided to eat there and the service was unbelievably slow, the restaurant was not full at all so my mom & I couldn't understand why there was a one hour delay with our order. By the time the server delivered our food we had lost our appetite to eat so we just bagged the food to go. It doesn't matter to me how good the food is if the service isn't as excellent as the food, it ruins the whole dining experience for me. I would also like to mention that the Oyshi servers do not take initiative to bring you the things you'll need to eat such as utensils, napkins, chopsticks, etc.... I had to ask for everything & that was a pain in the a**. Overall, I was disappointed with the service at Oyshi & I hope to see improvement in the future."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never written a review for this..I've been going to Oyshi for years!  Oyshi is the best place to go for AYCE mainly because of their appetizer and dessert selections.    What I love to get are baked mussels and sizzling plates: asian skirt steak and surf and turf.  If you're hungry, these plates aren't shareable, but most of the time they are.  The asian skirt steak has a hint of sweetness to it.  It comes on a bed of lettuce and onions that the cast iron plate cooks.    The surf and turf is just a few pieces of tenderloin steak with 2 pieces of shrimp also on a bed of lettuce and onions that the cast iron plates cooks.  Very tender steak, and the shrimp was grilled to perfection.    I like to get nigiris: salmon, garlic tuna, and yellowtail.  All the fish tastes fresh.  The salmon was orange and marbleized as it should be.  You can get your tuna 3 different ways, but garlic is my favorite.  Yellowtail I got plain.  Always a good tasting fish.    Rolls:  Had a few and they were good, but none of them really caught my attention to be honest.     Dessert: Vanilla creme brulee.  I had a bite of the green tea creme brulee, and that was good as well.    Appetizers, soups, nigiris, and desserts are well worth the AYCE."}
{"text":"A couple of dollars more expensive than some other ayce sushi places, but it's worth it! They're busy a lot so be prepared to wait a little but. Again, it's worth it though! Really great tasting sushi and good customer service."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of sushi and usually always go for the AYCE option if one is available so I can try many different option. This is the first place I have gone where I was really disappointed. There were flies everywhere and the food just did not have that fresh flavor I am used to. All the items I tried were pretty bland and almost tasted stale. There are better sushi places around so I don't think I will be returning :("}
{"text":"My oh my what can I say. It was definitely Oishi, even if they did spell it wrong. I came to vegas to quell the beckoning of the seven deadly sins. And I can safely say I left knowing full well that Gluttony is very satisfied (there's got to be some sort of ironic word play here, but goodness I can never figure it out). Oyshi Sushi has definitely raised the bar for the SoCal AYCE sushi restaurants. I might even say it is comparable to the delicious and the very-missed Kami (RIP)  The SKINNY: I came with a group of 12. I was one of the last to show up, and I was very surprised at the fact that it could seat 12 people. The usual AYCE sushi ordering paradigm (...i barreled through 4 seasons of The Big Bang Theory) is a check list that is given to the waitress, which will be dropped off at the chef, and eventually you'll be nom-noming your way through delectable bite size raw fish goodness. But here, there is no checklist, you order directly to the waitress. But amazingly almost all orders made by the 12 people were satisfied! This place has amazing service with a very patient staff, and a variety of Nigiri and Rolls that i so deeply yearn for here in california. It's 26 dollars well spent my friends.   The Food: Okay so originally we were suppose to go to Sushi Mon, but one thing led to another and we ended up at Oyshi. \"they have a better variety of rolls, and most of our group prefers rolls....\" Hearing it breaks my heart, but the need of the many outweighs the need of the few, so I had to comply. But! hot dam, this place got some unique selections for just the simple nigiri. Spanish Mackerel? Garlic Tuna? Halibut? Seriously, the Koreans owning our local southern california ayce sushi joints needs to take a page of the koreans owning Nevada's ayce sushi joints. I have to say, they were all amazing (with the exception of the cajun albacore. that was just good. But it's still better than bad) I have to point out the fact that they offer a free order of Amaebi and Uni, AND 4 pcs of raw oysters per customer. Being that most of the people I went with was apprehensive to raw food, I ate more than enough free orders. My goodness, my raw oyster cravings won't start up for at least another month (seriously, it's like a menstrual cycle. I know, i'm disgusting).  Everybody speaks of how great their rolls are, and sure they are pretty good. But honestly, I can't remember them for the life of me. So maybe they were more forgettable than spectacular. But who cares, give me another 4 pieces of raw oysters dammit! That's what's important here.  The Service:  Oh poor poor waitress. She had to go through so much...good thing we tipped her generously (and this is coming from a Chiense man). The service is actually spot on, given that there were some dead times where our food arrived a bit slow, but its a minor issue. Afterall, there were probably 5 sushi chefs taking care of a whole restaurant, INCLUDING a party of 12.   This place is a bit off the Vegas Strip, but who cares, it's all you can eat SUSHI. and It's good! The only reason why you wouldnt come out here is if you said \"Oh i ate too much at the Wynn Buffet already.\" And that's barely an excuse."}
{"text":"Great place for business lunch! I was there with my team and had the sashimi lunch. They were able to pack in 14 pieces of sashimi in the bento box and the quality was ok. The place is small so be there early!"}
{"text":"Nasty, smushy abacore, not my favorite place. Just had it for lunch today and now im in the toilet w diarrhea every hour. My mouth is so dry now."}
{"text":"Since someone reached out and responded to my post, I decided to update my review. My one star was an accumulation between the food and the service I received. If I subtract your server's hesitation, then I'll give it three stars."}
{"text":"I cant believe its taken me this long to find this place! stumbled upon this sushi restaurant while out doing some errands today and what a hidden treasure! Usually sushi bars have a very boring decor and bland music but this place was playing Trance music.. that is awesome! with beautiful decor to the wall art and the exposed pipes it has a very stylish/modern feel to it. I almost felt like I was in San Francisco.  I ordered the seaweed salad. It was a very generous portion but my only gripe was it was completely covered in sesame seeds which i am not a fan but know next time to request them to be left out. The seaweed itself was very fresh and the right amount of dressing was used. Then i ordered the Hawaiian roll with soy paper. It had albacore, shrimp, and cucumber inside wrapped in a Cajun albacore and avocado tossed with some ponzu sauce... heaven. Seriously one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had and I consider myself a sushi connoisseur.  The popcorn scallops are amazing as well. they're little scallops deep fried and served with a wasabi ranch and honey mustard sauce.  I had the all you can eat which was only $25 and that even included 2 oysters! Amazing deal especially for the quality. Ive already been 3 times in the past 3 days and Ill probably end up here at least 3-4 times a week. LOVE LOVE LOVE!  Oh! and the sushi chefs are awesome. :)"}
{"text":"I really don't know how this restaurant is getting 5 stars? Is this friends and family? The fish was fresh enough, but when the rice is twice the size of any AYCE sushi out there, it seems to not be worth it. I ate mainly nigiri. The waiter was apologetic enough, though he forgot many orders. Service was painfully slow, and I started to think it was a tactic strategy so i will eat less since there were 15 minute gaps. Plus only one dessert? I normally have 2, which I always eat since portions are usually small. Needless to say, I will not be coming back even if it is 2 blocks away."}
{"text":"Came in with a smile .. Left with a disappointment ...  I don't really know where to start ... It's that bAd .. We felt like our server failed  in customer service. She took our order and we dint get some of it .. She was blaming the kitchen about it .. Second we got left out in-between 1st and second order for ayce sushi  ... So we're waiting for her to come back .. I have to call the hostess to place my second order while she went to look for the server .... Argh what a waste of time and we pretty much lost our appetite I told the Busser or food runner name osmar  bout the issue .. He was very nice and tried to deliver a good service to make up for the bad service from our server.He told the manager about the issue & he kept coming back to our table to check on us .. The manager gave us 1 comp for lunch but it definitely didn't change the fact the we had a bad experience and we are Never coming back :("}
{"text":"We've had lunch here for the second time in the last few weeks and it's true the place is rock solid as far as I can tell by our last two visits. I waited to post a review after our second visit because often the first time may not be enough of an experience to grade a restaurant properly. Excellent quality all around, good atmosphere and most importantly the food is prepared consistently which is the main flaw with most restaurants, not just sushi places. Service is very good and everyone seems to help each other deliver orders to the tables. We really like the fact that the fish inside the rolls are actually cool in temperature and not warm like most places we've tried. The sauces are light in flavor and not over powering, which can overwhelm and kill the fish flavor of good quality sushi rolls. My only negative remark would be that for some reason, after our initial order the second order (often our final order) which is probably 1 or 2 rolls it seems to take a while to come out. Also today my wife wore white pants and it seems there was some soy sauce spilled on the seat of the booth and it stained her pants which I noticed when we went shopping afterwards, but no big deal since it would be hard to see that soy sauce was spilled on a black booth cushion. \"We ain't mad at ya\", we will be back for more. We hardly tried the extensive offerings this menu features. The best All You Can Eat sushi in town!"}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite place to grab sushi!! Never been to this location and hoping quality is just as good as their sahara location.   Ordered my usual favorites, Oyshi and tiger roll! Glad the flavors were consistent just like their other location. Plus I get my money worth here because they don't over load their sushi with rice.   Good food and a great waiter, Stefan makes my first experience at this location great!!"}
{"text":"Friends took me here while visiting. Came hungry and left over stuffed, this AYCE did not disappoint. All my favorites, nothing fancy just good sushi. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Second time coming to this location after a fairly good experience the last time we came when we were in Las Vegas. The website and Yelp both say this location closes at 11pm so we went in for a late dinner at about 9pm. The restaurant was noticeably less crowded than the last time we were there but we were seated right away. Our waitress was good and quickly came by and took our orders. The first round of food came out quickly, everything was good except the uni which was definitely bad.   The restaurant started to thin out and eventually we were the only table left. I have worked restaurants for a long time so I get it, I know what it is like to be over it and want to go home. However, there is a level of professionalism that is expected when you have any customers around. My parents ordered a couple of hand rolls, etc for their last round and was definitely falling apart and literally thrown on the plate.   The biggest issue for me was one of the other employees (not our server). Before 10pm the rest of the workers were already cleaning up and talking to the other employees, no big deal I get it. However, one of the employees was incredibly unprofessional. Literally yelling (again we were the only table in the restaurant), cussing every other word, I literally heard him at one point YELL \"Oh fuck ya, when her fucking titties were hanging out!\" I am far from a prude but I was literally there with my parents who are obviously older and do not tolerate that kind of stuff. My mom was mortified, that employee did  come by our table with a half-ass \"sorry for being loud, it's been a long day\" while literally laughing. We were all over it and just wanted to get out of there. When we left not a single employee said thank you, good night, anything.   I would definitely recommend going to their other location or just trying another AYCE sushi spot."}
{"text":"Man, I am so glad I came back to try this place again. It must have been a fluke day when I went before with my previous review because I have been back a few times and it's been awesome ever since. This has become one of my favorite places to go for sushi! Their sushi was fresh and every roll was delicious. My favorite is the salmon belly! As for the rolls, you can never go wrong with the Love Affair!   My friends and I came here late one night and it felt like we were there forever! Our server was friendly and got us our orders in a timely manner. We never had a lull where we didn't have any sushi on the table. Such great customer service throughout our night!"}
{"text":"Loved this location! Food was tasty and service was on point. I liked this location better than the original."}
{"text":"I love this place. I really do... I just wish it was three times the size. But at the same time, that's part of the charm. It's small, cozy, and full of funky/kitschy Japanese decor and a hundred framed autographs from all the famous people who have eaten here.   Went for dinner with Daddio & D last week. It was D's first time, but Dad and I have come here together a few times before. It's our go-to place before seeing something at Harbourfront Centre. Now that I work there, it's dangerous!  Some of the freshest sushi I've had, and I appreciate the rice-to-other-stuff ratio here, which is not a lot of rice and a LOT of other stuff. YUMYUMYUM!  The miso soup is incredible here - for those who think all miso soup is the same, come here and discover your folly. It's one of my favourites in the city (Toronto proper).  D got the Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box, and loved it. Tempura deserves a particular mention - I tried it. I'm a sucker for yam tempura though!!!  Dad got a bunch of assorted sushi & sashimi and adored it all, as per usual. We love this place. I don't eat fish, but I hear the \"ahhh\"s and the \"mmmm\"s all over the place.  We also got the butter mushroom app.... drool. As for me, I ordered the cucumber rolls and the avocado rolls. Lovely, lovely, lovely.  Our dinner for three (and we ordered 4 appetizers as well as three entrees, sake and beer) came to under $100 without tip.  The service is INSANELY fast. Even when they are full, it's unbelievably rapid. If you're looking for a leisurely sushi experience, you won't find it here, though we didn't really feel rushed, either.  As others have said, it's a little hard to find, but don't second guess yourself. Keep following the food store around the corner and you'll see it.  I have to say, I am so disappointed when an unsalted, cold edamame app arrives at the table. Is that the/a regional or traditional way of serving it or something? I don't know. I've never heard of that. I like my edamame hot and salty.  Preferably with flakes of salt. Not the case here...   It loses the rest of the edamame-drained star because there's no standard bar. Just beer, wine and sake. BOOOO! This girl needs cocktails as part of just about ANY occasion."}
{"text":"I start eating there for few weeks because I love sushi .Sushi is good but serves  the waiters are very rude. They have no respect. Second time I came with my kid . They didn't like that .Specially during the lunch . I had restaurants for many years. I never go back again. I rather spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"So, after doing much research, hoping to find a great alternative to my usual spot for AYCE sushi, I decided on Oyshi, solely because of the great reviews I saw here on Yelp.   I looked up the website, called and asked about prices, and finally my boyfriend and I decided to make the trip out.   We arrived at about 8:30pm, and it was a Friday night, so I expected it to be bustling. During our wait to be seated,  I scoped out the crowd, and noticed the usual. Mostly those under the age of 30, large groups of them in fact, and figured this must be their spot before they hit the clubs, considering their attire. Well, it was either that or the fact that the music in the restaurant sounded as if you were already in a night club. It must be set on Pandora or something. Anyway, it was only about a 15 minute wait, which wasn't bad at all.   So, besides my observations of the restaurant ambiance and demographic, we finally were able to look at the menu. My boyfriend usually orders the nigiri, so we got the usual garlic tuna, albacore, cajun albacore, and decided to try the Oyshi scallops. As for the rolls, I decided on the Sibuya No Rice, Coco, and a Bonsai. I also decided to get the agedashi tofu, grilled beef asparagus, baked mussels and seaweed salad. This was only the first round after all.  We were excited to eat until the food arrived on our table. First the nigiri, the presentation was obviously not of any importance, but you can't judge a book by its cover, so we took a few bites anyway.   Verdict,   the garlic tuna was DISGUSTING. It smelled and tasted like spoiled blood. I've had garlic tuna many times at many other restaurants, and this one had to be the worst. It even looked slimy, not because of the sauce, just itself.  the albacore was seared, and also tasted old. It had the same garlic sauce poured over it as the garlic tuna, and it was mushy.  the Oyshi scallops I thought were going to be \"OISHI\" but, definitely not. They mixed it with crab meat, and very light mayo, and it fell apart immediately as I tried to pick it up.   the cajun albacore had TOO MUCH cajun seasoning! I usually love cajun albacore, and this was too much for my palate, on top of that it was DRY.  my boyfriend got his usual spicy tuna hand rolls as well, and the spicy tuna looked a little spoiled.   on to the rolls,  the Bonsai, had the cajun albacore on it as well, but I had to bear it to see if the spicy tuna in the center was at least average. The roll as a whole was not to my liking.  the Coco, was probably the most decent roll on table, probably because each of the ingredients in it were fully cooked.  the Sibuya No Rice, again with the spicy tuna... eh.  the appetizers,  the agedashi tofu is usually my favorite appetizer!!! It came out looking as if it were just fried up, and I commend the presentation on this one, but the center was cold, the sauce was not tasty, and I hate that it is not \"bite-size\" as most Japanese cuisine is known to be.   the seaweed salad was not a bright green and although it was crispy, it had an ugly after taste, I've had better, let's just leave it at that.  the grilled beef asparagus was drizzled in teriyaki sauce. The asparagus was perfect, but the beef wrapped around it was dry somehow.  the baked mussels were not baked enough, and the yumyum sauce was pretty tasteless.   I was disappointed already, but decided to take another round of appetizers, since I knew the sushi wasn't going to be very enjoyable. I settled for calamari, shrimp/veg tempura, edamame, asian style skirt steak, and some other things that were just not memorable enough.  I knew it was bad when I was scarfing down edamame and tempura. The calamari looked good, but the dipping sauces  (ranch and a mayo/mustard mix) could have been more \"asian\" I guess? My boyfriend ate the skirt steak (aka Korean bulgogi, in my opinion). He even commented \"I'm eating beef, which is probably the last thing I would expect to eat at a Sushi restaurant.\"  With that said, it smelled as if something was burning the entire night we were there!   Hm, it was overall a disappointing experience.  We have both gone to many sushi restaurants, with my list including restaurants in Hawaii and San Francisco, California, and I wanted to seriously give this place a chance. Unfortunately, Oyshi just did not live up to the hype!  On a side note though, my waitress was very helpful, and service was mediocre, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Frequent patron of this establishment .. It is one of the few sushi restaurants I highly recommend. The wait to get seated can be gruesome depending on the time of arrival and time of the day. Once seated though service has always been great. Their rolls are fully stuffed so be careful, you can easily get stuffed with just a few. Start out light with a few Appetizers then go in on a roll or two. They do half orders also so that's always the best way to gonif you just want to taste a new roll. Sushi has always been fresh here and I hope it remains that way. I've been coming to this place for about 7yrs now. My first sushi restaurant experience and I'm glad its still around! Try this place out, you won't leave unsatisfied"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere!  Hidden treasure on a street with other sushi restaurants that deserve less attention! Some of the wait staff need a little more training. ( we had the Asian version of Debbie Downer) but overall outstanding!! He the Udon!!"}
{"text":"Chef Ivan is our favorite! Always a great time when we come for dinner. The food is always delicious and he is always attentive no matter how busy it is. Tried the quail with ikura and it was pretty good. I didn't even have to order it because he heard me asking the waiter about it.   Mono is always great too! Best waiter! He is always giving excellent service and even recommend the quail with ikura.   I gave a 4 because there is always a waiting time when we come. Usually the waiting estimates around 30 min or more but it is understandable as the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Hangry!!! I only give it one star because the one roll I had was good and because the waiter was some what attentive. After waiting almost a full hour and receiving only one roll, I was basically was ignored at the bar. Hello right in front of you!!!! Not one person asking me if I received my rolls. The look on the sushi chefs faces was \" I thought you made them,\" \"no I thought you made it.\" \"Where did they go?\" No real apologies or even a \"sorry next time we'll be better, so the roll you did receive is free.\" Nope I waited while I paid for the only roll I had. Next time it's busy, do yourself a favor and get the lunch special at a table and avoid leaving hungry and angry!!'"}
{"text":"Where do I start with this place? First of all, we have been visiting Oyshi for 3-4 years now and have had ours ups and downs. When the owner is not around, the place goes haywire. I will say the quality of food is usually pretty good and when the heavier gentleman is behind the sushi bar, we are treated phenomenally. This is where it ends. There is zero consistency. This evening we arrived around 11:30 PM. There were 6-8 tables seated as well as about 6 people at the sushi bar. We opted to sit at the bar. There were 2 sushi chefs for the entire restaurant so we already assumed the wait time on food would be a bit slow but being that it was so late at night this wasn't a problem. What was a problem was the HORRIBLE service we received. There was a group of what seemed to be off duty employees sitting in the back portion of the bar drinking. The chefs were going over to that side at least every 5 minutes, taking shots and conversing, as tickets sat in front of them. At one point one of the servers had to go through the kitchen and behind the bar to ask a chef for extra sauce. The woman who took our order came back once after 10 minutes and once more after about 25. We placed our order with another server who did not write anything down and alas, forgot 3 of the 4 items we ordered. At this point, visibly bothered, one of the chefs told us to order any sushi through him, which we did. That too was forgotten. We could not even enjoy the $60 dinner we paid for and rushed out of there as to flee a very uncomfortable situation. Unfortunately I think it is time to find a new neighborhood sushi spot as this place clearly allows their employees to run the show which shows in their service."}
{"text":"We are very disappointed with Love affairs.It's a little cold.Told the server but nothing she can do.She said she will tell the chef!That's it."}
{"text":"Went here the other day and was the only patron on the right side of the sushi bar. Had already ordered and asked if they could switch the TV from ESPN to World Cup and was told they wouldn't switch it because they don't like soccer. Thought he was joking and asked again and he confirmed they wouldn't change TV due to not liking soccer. Spoke to the \"manager\" and told her that was the worst customer service I've ever heard and barely got an apology. Got a 10% discount lol. Never going there again."}
{"text":"Oyshi Sushi Bar Restaurant is definitely a must go! I've been here three times since it has been introduced to me on July 5th of 2014. It obviously hasn't been that long ago and it has already taken my interest and satisfies my cravings! I love their Ayce pricing ($21 lunch/$26 dinner) and of course the all-you-can-eat selections! I highly suggest their yellowtail with pico de gallo, seaweed salad, fresh oysters, and shrimp tempura as starters to prepare you for this sushi selection like Kami Kaze, Dragon, Rock N' Roll, Catepillar, Treasure and etc. Seriously though, this place is amazingly delicious. My only complaint as to why I gave this place a four star instead of a five because customer service can take you a long way and two out of the three times I've been here was a little below fair. It took them almost 20 mins in order to finally give us some attention and take our second order, they didn't refill our drinks unless asked and our wait for our entree was quite some time. Asides that, the food is heavenly mouth-watering and the AYCE pricing is good!"}
{"text":"This place is close to my parents' place in Vegas.  I came here with my mom around dinner on a Monday.  Not very crowded.  We ordered the AYCE.  The quality of fish is decent, they don't give you a lot of rice on the sushi which is good because that is a total filler when it comes to AYCE sushi.  The price is pretty good, its under $30/person for dinner.  The service here was good, they check-in on us often, but were not overbearing.  The only thing that sucked was at the tables, they don't offer the half rolls.  It's only available at the sushi bar.  So, if you want half rolls, request to sit at the sushi bar.  There wasn't anything that really stood out.  They have specials written on the chalk board in the front.  When we were there, they had a pork belly appetizer, which tasty good.  Nice and fatty, but it was a little chewy for my taste.  This is good for the local area.  You don't have to wait as long as one that is closer to the Strip, but if I'm in this area and crave sushi, this is a good spot to go to."}
{"text":"This is not made up...  I am a patient man. My girlfriend and I work in the service industry. My girl even works at a sushi place. This is literally the worst service I have ever encountered.   Sat down for Ayce lunch at 1:30.. Our first order of Nigiri hadn't came out, it was now 1:55. We didn't order anything special, just slice the fish and send it out. We ask the server about our order. She abruptly leaves, and I can see the sushi chef and the server arguing with each other.  She then advised us that she forgot to put the order in. I thought, ok.. Cool. The world isn't a perfect place, and we all make mistakes... But when we make a mistake, a good server should hurry to correct it and make it right.   Waited 20 min... low and behold, she forgot to put the order in a second time. It has now been 45 min since I ordered the Nigiri.. No exaggeration. By this time I've lost my appetite. The restaurant isn't even busy, the place was half full.  I felt disgusted paying the $47 plus $10 tip.. I tipped 20 percent just because I'm in the tipping industry, and don't have the heart to stiff this chick. She also told me they don't do half rolls. I could have sworn they did before.  I will never come back to this establishment. Thanks server with the black sketcher shoes."}
{"text":"This sushi place located in a strip mall off the strip is a good find.  We went here for dinner after house hunting around the area and decided to go with the all you can eat option for about $25.  The all you can eat feature allows you to order anything off the menu (rolls, hot japanese items, soup, tofu, nigiri sushi, and a selection of a few desserts including mochi).  The only exception is sashimi.  Each of the rolls off the menu ranges from $12-15/per roll so I think the all you can eat is worth it if you've worked up an appetite.  The rolls are pretty good and made to order which is different from a typical Japanese buffet in which the rolls are sitting out there for who knows how long.  Service is pretty good and the decor of the restaurant is modern and clean.    I enjoyed coming to this sushi place and for $25, the food and service can't be beat.  Thanks Oyshi for a great meal."}
{"text":"There was no host to greet us to lead us to a table. My family waited for 5 minutes before we got a \"hello\". There was barely any people eating and all the staff was looking at us. That level of professionalism was an insult to our face. I'm giving 2 stars because at least the place inside looked nice enough to stare at for five minutes before we left."}
{"text":"I ate way too much. Food was awesome. We got all you can eat and we sampled everything."}
{"text":"this is a great place to eat. always ask for their specials. you can't just have enough of their salmon belly."}
{"text":"Another great AYCE experience today at Oyshi for Mother's Day!!! I made reservations for noon and was seated where we requested immediately."}
{"text":"Oyshi has been mine and my husband's go to sushi restaurant in Vegas for the last two years now. All their food is fresh and we have never had a bad experience here. The staff is very friendly and welcoming"}
{"text":"Quaint little sushi place next to the Kitchen Table Grocery store. I ordered take-out (as did several other patrons), so I can't comment too much on the ambiance. But from the looks of it, the entire place probably can't hold any more than 40 people.   The yellowtail fish was pretty fresh (smooth and buttery), roll selection was okay, but the prices are pretty steep (though I'm coming from Texas, so I'm not sure that I'm the best judge of Toronto sushi prices). Service was very friendly and appreciative. As a plus (for me, at least), they all spoke Japanese, which is such a pleasant language to listen to."}
{"text":"This place is pretty busy during the evening, the menu has a really nice selection with variety. The service was truly excellent and our server Ploi was great. The only thing I was not a fan of was the rice, I felt like the rice was too crunchy and not what you expect for sushi. Overall recommend this place but don't expect top tier fish cuts and amazing rice. Just my two cents."}
{"text":"Now that the idea of all you can eat sushi doesn't creep me out I had the best experience and a new loyalty to Oyshi Sushi. The ambiance is hip and cool the demographic is everything from older couples to young Hipsters.   You don't feel like you are in the suburbs but you don't feel like you are in a Las Vegas suburb either. The service is friendly and fast. The Rolls & Appetizers are made to order. If you throw down @ the Sushi Bar you will no doubt get your money's worth. They have an all you can eat lunch & dinner special. The icing on the cake (har-har) is the desert. Yes, it's true the green tea tiramisu is as good as it sounds.   I have to thank fellow yelper Cameron G for the info on this one"}
{"text":"Great service, fresh food. Our party ordered all you can eat. The atmosphere is great here and the restaurant is very clean. The food was better than other sushi restaurants in town. The service was quick and the staff was friendly. Will definitely be coming back soon"}
{"text":"Oyshi is awesome. The food is amazing. Love the fact that the menu includes steaks. The waiters are fun and easy to talk to and I always have a good experience with them. They made my birthday really fun."}
{"text":"I just wanted to update from my last review and say that ever since Andrew came back, the place has completely turned around for the better! I love Oyshi again and the service is waaay better!! They no longer mess up or forget my orders.  Loove Oyshi! Now I can say they have one of the best AYCE sushi dinners in Las Vegas. Everyone should try it!"}
{"text":"Hawaii friends and fam one the best sushi spots that all you can eat here . Sit at the bar and Chef Ed treats ya like family . The staff here is on point and the food is bomb ."}
{"text":"Wow, our food took 25 minutes in between each dish.  Don't know if this is a gimmick they use for all u can eat so people can get mad n leave n don't eat lots of their food.  I'm not coming again.  Good or not, it was a waste of my time sitting and waiting for food."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! Horrible service. The manager didn't seem to care about his poor server we complained about either."}
{"text":"Oh how I wanted Oyshi on Sahara to become a local fave since it's so close to my place! Strike three and they were out. Sad as the atmosphere is great. I have added a star for the friendly server our last visit, which will be the last.   It was a Saturday eve, around 6pm w four of us; two got the all you can eat, and my daughter and I, a la carte. The quality and freshness of the sushi was poor to begin with but the quality of the ayce comparatively was horrid.    It was sad but yet amusing as had a friend over from Asia and was headed to Tokyo the next day and we were watching the World Cup on their bar tv in which Japan was playing.  There are plenty of decent sushi places but this is not one of them. I had heard they're other location is good, but don't think I will even attempt as have other places on my list."}
{"text":"I love Oyshi, but they need to change their lighting ASAP. Every time I go there I get so dizzy, and feel so sick I always need to leave right away. I asked the waiter if other people have the same problem and he even said people have complained to him about feeling dizzy and sick. Other than that issue, try the lobster fair its amazing!"}
{"text":"Over the top service and very cool atmosphere!    I had a Volcano Roll and Love Affair roll.  Both my wife and I absolutely loved!  Best Sushi we have ever had in Vegas.  And we live here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places! Went for late night happy hour and did all you can eat which is the way to go! They bring the food out as it is made and I really couldn't find anything to complain about."}
{"text":"The sushi is really good but it is the Hotategai sushi (raw scallop) is what keeps me coming back as a regular and I didn't give this spot five stars only because the waiters can be hit or miss for good service"}
{"text":"AYCE lunch was only $22/person! Sushi came out fresh and delicious, service was great, and decor was industrial and beautiful. There was no wait when I arrived around noon but customers quickly trickled thereafter. I can't see this place being busier than Goyemon which is why I like it :)  Also, I would recommend the Kamikaze rolls"}
{"text":"Literally sitting in the restaurant writing this review because I'm so upset with how slow the service is here. We ordered our food at 3:00 and all we asked for was 6 pieces of salmon, 2 pieces of Cajun albacore, and 2 pieces of escolar. It's 3:45 and we still haven't received our food. How hard is it to put some fish on top of rice? They aren't even busy right now."}
{"text":"Their new location is in the space formerly occupied by Go Wild Sushi. Somehow they made the space less appealing. They tore out a row of booths and replaced them with tables. Also gone is the performance stage. The rest of the decor looks half finished. Luckily, their food is much better. A sampling of tuna, albacore, halibut, and yellowtail nigiri showed that their sushi is better than your average AYCE spot. An order of pork belly was good despite drowning in sauce. Rolls were fairly well crafter with minimal rice and ample fish. Each AYCE meal comes with one dessert. I opted for the velvety smooth chocolate creme brulee with its thick sugary crust.  A kid's menu is available. My kid's order of popcorn chicken filled a large bowl. As an a la carte item, it was an inexpensive deal that easily would have fed four kids. He ended his meal with a ice cream parfait made with vanilla ice cream, granola and chocolate and strawberry syrup.  3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"First off, it's dark in there. Like seriously, the only light that enters is through the tinted front glass doors. So you feel like you're in some cavernous spot, and when it's bright & sunny out it kinda feels weird. However, if you like that sort of thing, then have at it. Our Server, Rey, was pretty awesome! His energy & enthusiasm was the light in this cave. We ordered a few things then based off his suggestion, we ordered a different roll. Nice one too!  The Food Runner, I found myself helping him out. Like when we delivered the edamame, rather than attempting to place it in the middle of the table, he placed it off to my side, because there were a few things in the way. In my experience, yes I have worked in restaurants, when that happens, you set the dish down, make room, then place the dish in the center. However, that was his kind of thing, literally, just bring the food out. Didn't add to the experience, was just there. Oh but wait! The food! Yes, we did eat here. The sushi wasn't bad. For being our first time, and we only ordered 4 out of the tons of options! Again, I've had my share of sushi and the staple of a roll is the consistency of the rice. It has to be sticky. It has to hold it all together with the help of the seaweed. Well, flavor wise, the rolls were good. Like seriously. The rice was just meh. It wasn't terribly sticky. Some parts were a little brittle & dry. No, not the worst thing, just not the best. Now here's the AWESOME part. The have all you can sushi for $20! Yup! $20!! I can do and be experiencing this little feature for sure! Of course I'll be trying more sushi options for sure! Plus, what other way can you experience a spot with an all you can option??? It's on!"}
{"text":"Oyshi means \"delicious\" in Japanese and this restaurant doesn't disappoint. For local Las Vegans, this is the spot to go for delicious sushi!  Locals drive from the North (about 30-40 minutes away) just to eat here.  Sushi is fresh and tasty. Get the Nuclear Bomb and the Heart Attack! Even the dessert is good. Get the creme brulee!  If you go for dinner, make sure to choose all you can eat, otherwise you'll be paying buckos! All You Eat menu is anything except sashimi. As of this writing, $26 for All you can eat dinner, $21 for lunch. It will be worth your money.  Waitstaff is casual and easygoing. They play EDM music in the background which keeps the atmosphere upbeat and fun.   Only reason not a 5 star is because there usually is a wait. Everytime we've gone, we have had to wait 20-30 minutes for a table.   But it's always been worth the wait!  4 stars for us!"}
{"text":"We went here for my sons bday celebration.  It was 6:30 on a Sunday night and it was fairly busy but not terrible. We got sat right away.  And then we waited...and waited...and waited.  We finally got waters and placed our first order of the all you can eat menu.  We waited some more.....and waited.  We finally had to ask where our food was and when the hot food came out it was cold so we sent it back and waited some more.  We were not the only table this was happening to.  There seemed to be plenty of servers and bussers and everyone looked busy but there wasn't a whole lot going on.  The servers and the manager made sure to not make eye contact with anyone but glanced toward the back of the restaurant contantly.  $27.00 isn't bad for all you can eat except when you can't get the food you ordered. We will not be back here anytime soon if at all."}
{"text":"It all depends on the wait staff, twice before a male with glasses polite & accurate today girl terrible couldn't get me a salad with dressing on the side. 3 tries too hard for het! Order incorrect too wait for check could only make it to my table when my phone was ringing. Didn't understand how to wait for me all about her"}
{"text":"Oh boy I wish I could give negative stars!!!!!!!!!!!! This place let me down because of lazy front girls!!! I was one of two groups that left after being told there would be a 10 to 15 minute wait...all the while watching people leave and observing two empty tables. The waiting area starts to get packed in and this girl is flipping her pen with a dumbfounded look on her face just staring at the crowd of 17 in the waiting area. Yes I counted lol...that is when I talked to the manager, told her what was going on...told her I love this place, I come here all the time...BUT I WILL NO LONGER BE RETURNING. At which point I took my family and left. Good bye OYSHI!!! I do realize there is a rotation to be fair to the servers but that should not matter when the place is busy. But I am pretty sure I may get an excuse as a rsponse. All my family and friends come here because of my recommendation...I will be sure to have them avoid OYSHI."}
{"text":"AYCE dinner at $27. The sushi roll menu is extensive but I didn't even look at that section closely. Our strategy is always to get the nigiri sushi/appetizers/items that are limited - totally worth it then. What I like most about this place is that the fish is fresh. We ordered A LOT of salmon. I would skip the poke - it's mostly seaweed salad. Another highlight is that you can order sizzling plates of rib eye and other meats which were nicely portioned and tasty. Also got the medium house sake for only ~$12 which actually tasted fine and you get a good amount of shots when you're sharing it btw 2 people.   Our server was funny and quick with everything. He checked on us multiple times. This location is bigger than the one on Rainbow and we didn't have to wait for a table when we came in at 9 pm on a Saturday. There were plenty of open tables as well."}
{"text":"I've been here a total of 3 times for the dinner AYCE. 1st time:  pretty decent, will come again 2nd time:  hmmm...not as good as I had remembered it 3rd time:  nah, won't be coming back for AYCE, but for a la carte item.  There were a few items that my friend and I ordered that did not taste right.  The raw oysters were strangely bitter.  We let the kind manager/owner know about this and he apologized and took the plate away immediately.  The uni that came out had an off yellowish-brownish color.  I've had plenty of uni to know how it supposed to look, but this was slightly different.   The star of the night was the agedashi tofu.  Yum yum yum.  Was quite tasty.  Another highlight of this AYCE meal is the fact that you can still chose a scoop of icecream along with whatever dessert you want.  I chose the green tea icecream and the creme brulee.  Was yummy.  The chefs, staff, manager/owner are all super friendly and the service is quick.  Food however...aight."}
{"text":"I love all of the locations but everyone is super nice in this one! Server kept on checking on us to see if we needed something. And sushi was outstanding ! Definitely recommend this place. And will be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Service was good. AYCE was worth the price, but they need to update the website, prices have increased.  Most everything was great, the one thing that was not perfect they acknowledged and asked if I wanted another one and they would let the chef know.    Kids AYCE is way overpriced.  Get there early on a weekend dinner, it gets busy and service gets slower.  Lots of staff to make sure your food gets out fast and freshly prepared."}
{"text":"We are in town for a conference and was recommended this place.  It was PHENOMENAL!! There is a generous selection of sushi to choose from.  We have been to a lot of sushi places and this is by far the best for the price especially for the all you can eat option.  This place left us with such an impression we came back the next day!"}
{"text":"This place has easily become my favorite AYCE sushi joint after Luisa P. invited me to come for her brother's birthday dinner here. I had a bad experience here in 2011 so this was their second chance. Boy have they been delivering! We had one of the VIP rooms all to ourselves for his birthday because we were part of such a huge party. They did a great job of accommodating our big group and even brought in more tables as well as chairs so that we could all be included.  Be prepared to wait! If you plan on bringing a large group, have someone.. or a few someones come early so that you can put your name on the list. Just make sure the majority of your party is there to be seated. I want to say that all 3x I have came (during dinner time), the wait has been about 20 mins - 35 mins.  I love doing AYCE because as long as you eat about 3 rolls, you're getting your money's worth. Plus, it is fun to share delicious food! Make sure you're only sharing with those in your group that are getting AYCE or else they will get charged the AYCE price as well. They have an extensive rules/information outline on their menu.  I think that the service here is really great for them being busy ALL of the time. They were always coming back to check up on us and asked if we wanted to put in more orders. Our tables were never cluttered because different people would swing by and grab our empty plates, plus everyone was more than helpful when we needed anything.  My go-to rolls: MONSTER ROLL: ORDER IT, JUST ORDER IT! Pink Lady Roll. Spider Roll. Dragon Roll. Japanese Lasagna Roll. I need to try even more of their specialty rolls, I am guilt of sticking to my favorites! For appetizers, order the baked green mussels, they're amazing here. Only a few sushi joints can get it right, trust me.  If you know me, then you know that I LOVE white tuna nigiri/sushi. The first time I had it here, it was amazing. The second time was decent. Haha, hopefully it just keeps getting better because I order a lot of those wherever I go for sushi.   For dessert, order the Green Tea Tiramisu with vanilla ice cream on the side. Your mouth will thank me, lol.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The best all you can eat Sushi! Customer service is excellent and the food just kept coming! Their Salmon and Ahi were fresh, and all of the rolls we ordered were just delicious! We had a 20 minute wait because it was a Saturday night (expected), but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and was excited to try a new all you can eat sushi place. The rolls were delicious, the tempura was some of the best we have had. The only critique I would give is they charge too much for kids under 12. It's $27 per adult and $20 for children 12 and under. I will say the food is worth it and the ambiance is worth it. Our server, Ryan did a fantastic job so we did not hurt with full bellies!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars would be appropriate if everything was like usual; least that's what I'd presume taking everyone else's rating. Unfortunately, today wasn't like any other day. It was a very special day. When we walked in, four chefs and three waitress welcomed us. We ordered a beer, two miso soup, one ahi salad, one tempura, one pork belly, one mussel, six orders of sushi, and one roll. Yes we must have ordered a lot because it took them twenty minutes to come back to the table to check on us another twenty minutes to take the second order, another twenty minutes to tell us that our order will come out in no time. ..... we gave up on waiting and asked for the check. Waitress was still nice and polite but the speed of food was no where close to four stars... more like one star. .. nice waitress made it two stars.... manager was on duty, calling and talking with someone important. I'm sure they wouldn't want me back there because I ordered a lot, but I'd never recommend this place regardless...."}
{"text":"I went in recently for a birthday party for a work friend and loved all of the food! We were in a small room so it was hard to accommodate all of the birthday party guests. There were a lot of orders forgotten but with one server on our large party it was to be expected. The food was amazing though! If you are going in with a small party I highly recommend it, but there really isn't much space to have a big party. Other than the space issue everything was wonderful."}
{"text":"AYCE dinner for $26, best price! Fresh fish, which is rare in a desert environment; good portions, lots to go around the table. Smooth sake. Friendly, quick service. All around good eats!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the friendliness of the restaurant.  Also, the promptness and service is top notched.  This sushi ayce is by far the best in Vegas."}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere was nice, but there wasn't enough lighting to see the menu clearly. I was surprised that although their menu selection had a vast array, their portion is very tiny as if feeding children. Service was fair, but the overall impression for me was the size of the sushi. I was very surprised that it was only 1/3 the size of what I normally order here in Hawaii. You're eating in Vegas therefore, you'd expect their size to be at least normal, but that's what you get when they want to be cinchy, frugal, or should I say tight . Now I wonder if their fish was actually fresh or previously frozen!"}
{"text":"FLY IN SOY   What is the first thing you do before the sushi gets to your table? You pour soy on that little plate, but the last thing you expect is a dead fly to come out of there!   Now the fly is not the big problem, the problem was the waitress, instead of apologizing for the mishap she immediately started making excuses of how the fly's get into the restaurant ... I had to interrupt her by telling her to just change the set up.   When the bill came, no attempt to apologize for that nasty surprise was made nether verbally or physically on the bill.   Their food is decent but not great, I will never go there again nor tell others to go... too bad because its in my neighborhood ."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The service was great - super fast. And the Sushi! So good. The All You Can Eat is totally worth it."}
{"text":"Hello everybody, this sushi joint was off the hook, literally. The food is amazing, the service there is nothing like it anywhere else in town. Chef Daniel and Pedro are terrific sushi rollers and they provide great entertainment if you sit at the sushi bar. Our server was Kenny who never let us down with our drinks and ginger. Thank you again guys for the amazing food and great time."}
{"text":"Service is Slow, I think they have 1 menu for the entire place...Sushi was mediocre at best"}
{"text":"I love Oyshi! It's the best AYCE sushi spot I've ever been to! Love the food, love the service, love everything! I came with a party of 9, and our server was so attentive and accommodating that he came by our table a number of times to make sure if everything was ok or if we needed more food; even the host came by to check up on us, now that's good service.   Not only that but the food came out extra fast, usually at the AYCE sushi spots that I go to in the LA/OC area the food kinda lags, maybe because they want you to get full and not order more? Just an assumption :P  All the items that came out were good quality food:   - Oysters (limit one order (4 pieces) per person during dinner only) - Appetizers - Sushi - Hand Rolls - Speciality Rolls - Dessert (limit one per person)  And the selection is pretty extensive! And if you're a roll person, then you're in luck because the rolls are pretty small so that means you get to have more variety by ordering other different rolls."}
{"text":"Great place to go for AYCE sushi. Friendly sushi chefs and pretty nice ambiance. Luckily as I went to the wrong door first a gentleman who happened to be a regular helped me out and sure enough ended up sitting next to my date and I at the bar so I instantly became friends with the manager and staff. I suppose I could credit all the special attention and custom rolls to his presence but then again maybe that's just how they do things here.   Had a great experience and would come back again. Decent price, delicious rolls, friendly service."}
{"text":"Alright, I'm not an expert on AYCE sushi joints but I do feel like I can hold my own when it comes to sushi. The problem with AYCE spots is I often feel the cut and quality of the fish is usually subpar and or drenched in sauces. Or just beefed up versions of shrimp tempura rolls.   Unfortunately this place was just that. Two stars for subpar sushi. I do think they deserve an additional star for the amount of appetites they offer as part of the AYCE deal. It's fair pricing if you can house some sushi but if you're not someone with a hug appetite I think the cost is a bit overpriced for the quality of fish."}
{"text":"great ayce, they offer teriyaki steaks and dessert. Lunch is about 5 dollars cheaper"}
{"text":"Typically pick up food here! Good menu options! Being from the east coast, I'm not very used to the chopped California rolls but theirs is pretty good! They are quick and accommodating! Definitely recommend it! The inside is very nice!"}
{"text":"Sushi was pretty terrible. Service was fine but way too slow... Not a place I would recommend or go back too."}
{"text":"The food maybe good but the servers are rude. I wanted to sit at the end of bar and they had seats open, but Vince the server had a problem with me sitting there. Place stinks."}
{"text":"Oyshi has great food and I would highly recommend it if you are in the area and want AYCE sushi. The prices aren't bad and the menu has a variety of rolls and appetizers.  If you come on a Saturday like I did I would say expect a wait. This place gets busy  quick which is no surprise as it probably is one of the best AYCE places on that side of town.  After getting some delicious rolls you should try the green tea crème brûlée to end your meal!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place and the only place I go.  We went in for lunch right when they opened at 1130.  We have never had a bad experience.  The sushi is delicious but this visit the counter was filthy.  They soy sauce was stuck to the counter and messy and you could see the glass rings and food from people who had eaten previously.  The restrooms were so gross.  They looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a few weeks.  It's the first time I've ever been nervous eating my meal.  Cleanliness and sanitation is the utmost importance in restaurants especially sushi ones.  I hope if we come back that these issues are rectified."}
{"text":"Shoutout to Chef Ed!   The sushi rolls and sashimi were delicious and Chef Ed had a really cool vibe"}
{"text":"I actually like this place a lot.   Pros: they have a really large selection of specialty rolls and their menu in general is diverse. The restaurant is new and large and can accommodate large parties easily. They have all you can eat at a reasonable price.    Cons: some of the quality of the fish is questionable sometimes. Ive been here a few times and sometimes I can taste that the fish is not the freshest or the best quality.   Overall, this place is not bad. Ive been here about 5 times since this location opened and before that I would go to the one on Rainbow but the wait was just so long at that one so Im glad this one opened."}
{"text":"Oyshi is a block from my house so I eat here twice a week minimum .  It's an above average all you can eat sushi spot . Like all ayce sushi places in town they load on the sauces and mayo etc... I like most of the appetizers including the grilled ribeye and seaweed salad which is hard to mess up . At times they are very busy which leads to extended waits for ordered items . Not too much to complain about though . Green tea tornados is really good !"}
{"text":"We visited the place last night. The restaurant is nice and spacious and the host greeted us well when we walked in. I was immediately disappointed though when I was told hamachi isn't part of the AYCE. Other places offer them with limit one per customer. The waiter was okay, not too friendly. He asked for our drinks and gave us time to think about our first order. We didn't get our own plates though until we asked for it after appetizers. I would think that should be automatic along with the ginger and wasabi on a japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"first time here &amp; loved it!! probably one of the best all-you-can-eat sushi places I have ever ate! the only down side is its a bit pricey!! 21 for lunch &amp; 26 for dinner. but you get what you pay for! everything is made &amp; comes out fresh once you order it!  -miso soup delicious! wasnt salty at all! :)  -eel/avocado roll not a big fish person...but i have to admit was good! the eel overpowered the avocado for sure.  -salmon with rice  i dont eat raw fish or anything..but i had half of one piece and it wasnt bad at all!! it looked and tasted fresh! im sure all you salmon lovers would enjoy this very much.  -love affair shrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster with crunch flakes &amp; masago!! this was my favorite roll of the night! I finished the majority of the plate!!   -crunch scallop yummy!! taste had a sweetness to it and this was my second fav of the night.  -beef asparagus delicious!! loved this and i would have eaten more if i wasnt so stuffed!! one of my favorites. simple but great!  -rib eye steak teriyaki steak was tender!  -asian skirt steak steak was tender and could taste the ginger like crazy in this dish! in fact, you can taste all the ingredients they used to make this dish, but the ginger enhances a bit.  -agedashi tofu lightly fried soft tofu in green onion soy sauce! really light and it was phenomenol. I dont think you can ever ruin this dish.  -green tiramisu sucked!!! never order this.  my auntie & uncle said their creme brulee, parfait is great! their rattlesnake roll is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe the amount of selection that you get from this place. 78 rolls and tons of choices for sushi, plus its not like other all you can eat places where the rolls are California Roll based; I counted only 4 that are out of the 78. They also have daily specials that's included in the all you can eat menu adding in oyster and sweet shrimp to the dinner menu.  The quality is higher than some places I know in California and this place is located in the middle of a desert. I always make it a priority to visit this place at least once when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Pretty good atmosphere...but, service kinda sucked cuz they were SUPER busy.  Even though we did AYCE it was hard to order anything because the waitresses were never available. Like we had to flag them down for everything: water, more sake, more sushi.  Other than the service the 4 stars is for the sushi. Always heard bout this spot from other Vegas locals and it didn't fail one bit.  Oysters were yum. Hamachi was on point. And everything we ordered was pretty much scarfed down like we never ate in days."}
{"text":"Passable sushi and AYCE experience...a bit too pricy though.  Do Sakana or Hikari if you want better price.  Food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely phenomenal! When I say that I am a regular....I mean a regular! I try to go at least 1 time a week, if not twice! Its impeccable! The service from right when you walk in to when you leave is one of a kind. I've lived in Vegas for 2 years now and its still my number 1! They have AMAZING Cajun albacore! I always suggest to order that! Another thing, they are open LATE! That's pretty convenient when you are talking sushi----most times you crave it and its around 9pm, no sweat, this place is open till 1am!   I laugh when I see the dang music review on here....this place is HITTING and slapping with great music! I promise you all that!"}
{"text":"Shame! Shame! Shame on me!   I have been here at least 4 times & have not given them some love!  Well, let me say... Oyshi is my new fav sushi place! Grrreeeattt Sushi at great prices... What can I say? I mean everything here is fabulous... I am a big raw eater - so, that is where I spend my calories & it is FRESH!  To agree with others, Yes, it is $26 for all you can eat!  However, there are also some great sides... they have these lil potato croquettes... sooo yummy... also, they have some steak wrapped asparagus :)  It is so hard to name all of the yummy eats they have there... this is def my place...  I do not mind the drive from Henderson, takes me 15 - 20min & I am in sushi heaven :)  Yes, you must go there! Go there and enjoy! You will not be sorry...  one thing though, since it has become popular a reservation is recommended on the weekends...  LOVE the Iris roll!  happy eating!  your constant companion,  ~deirdra"}
{"text":"Ate here for my sons 15 birthday. I am not a fan of sushi. However, this place has a large variety of cooked sushi. My 10 year old also agreed that the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Really nice and fancy atmosphere inside. Foods are so fresh and good.  But the place is too big so servers seem hard to take care of all customers when it gets busy."}
{"text":"I have been here about 10 times, everytime except my last visit has been 5 stars ayce sushi with 3 star service.  The lasttime I went may be my last though.  When in the bathroom I saw a server use the toilet and NOT WASH HIS HANDS, I was beyond disgusted and just flat out left...  GROSS.  Sucks cause this was always my go to sushi spot in Vegas!  Just thought others should know what I saw."}
{"text":"I enjoy Oyshi! Their appetizers are the stars of their all you can eat menu. Sizzling plates are where it's at! Surf and turf has the best flavors. My husband always gets the gyoza. Their sushi is fine. There's only a few rolls to \"call home about\". I do enjoy their nigri! Very fresh and tasty. This is definitely a spot to check out."}
{"text":"This place has some specialty rolls that are way more unique than most sushi joints. Other places would get repetitive and would lack originality to they're recipe kinda makes me feel like a similar franchise concept such as McDonald's. definitely not this place though. You can go to this place and pretty much order anything and it will be good."}
{"text":"The costumer service always seems a tad up-tight; they never like to make conversation. Other than that, the food is Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Excellent service we had Mono and Sia- all you can eat loved the skirt steak sizzling plate."}
{"text":"Updated 3/20/18 Once again Oyshi remains my number one AYCE sushi restaurant. Fresh, fast, fun and open late! They have buy one get one free Saki Monday's and Tuesday's.    Oyshi sushi is our favorite place to come!! We drive from Henderson just to hang at the bar with our favorite sushi chef Ed! Martin y Ricardo also mucho divertido! He's a lot of fun, as is the rest of the sushi chefs. They also play good hip hop music and will make custom rolls if you ask nicely!"}
{"text":"This is a very reasonablely priced sushi place. It is small and cozy so it's great for a party of 2-4. The taste is above average, and well worth the price.   Take out is always available. I would recommend to anyone looking for fast sushi"}
{"text":"Excellent service as well as fresh high quality fish. I've read some reviews where people say the service was horrible and it took over 30 minutes to receive their food. Here's an idea... Enjoy the company and talk with the people around you instead of staring at your watch. I did not experience bad service. Everyone asked if we needed anything often enough to keep our glasses filled and our stomachs full.   Now on to the amazing food! We had the ahi poke. Super fresh fish and delicious flavor. Ordered some hand rolls, yum yum and dragon. Once again the unagi and scallops were fresh and delicious. I have to say though that things only got better with the last two rolls. The double screaming roll and the Hawaiian roll made the meal! I used to be a huge sushi mon and wasabi fan but i think i found my new favorite. I was so impressed by the quality of food and the flavor I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Oyshi Sushi's Rainbow location for many years (it was my favorite sushi staple), and was delighted when it's sister Sahara location opened since it was much closer to where I live.    Oyshi consistently delivers fresh tasty quality sushi to its customers.  The deep variety of choices on their menu provides both cooked and raw choices for a varied crowd of people to be able to come together and share a Japanese style menu even though some guests don't indulge in eating raw seafood.  Their traditional sushi is so skillfully prepared that their yellow tail at times seems to just melt in your mouth.  They have so many varieties of rolls that a first time visitor could spend quite a while choosing from their assortment.  After years of coming here I can recommend some of my favorites.  The Rainbow Roll is a traditional California roll topped with a variety of seafood (tuna, salmon, yellow tail) in a mouth watering colorful display.  For a spicy roll, I enjoy the Red Rock.  It's a roll filled with spicy chopped salmon, served with a spicy mayo type topping. It's not the I have to drink water type of heat, but it has just enough heat not to blow out you taste buds.  If you're a soft shell crab lover, I highly recommend the Spider Roll.  The Spider roll contains fried soft shell crab parts layered in a crab mixture, placed in a roll.  It's slightly warm, extremely tasty, and the crunch from the soft shelled crab provides a delicious mild crunch to a roll that you just cant get enough of.  The all you can eat selection also includes tempura selections as well as rib eye steak served sliced in smaller pieces, with onions on a sizzl'n hot metal based plate. If you are still able to handle dessert, they offer a sunday or moche with the all you can eat option.  Beer, Cocktails, assorted beverages and hot tea (at additional prices) are available.  Their all you can eat lunch price is slightly lower than their dinner price, so you can expect to pay approximately 25 per person for lunch and 30 per person for dinner. Of course you could purchase off the menu for lighter appetites."}
{"text":"We always go eat sushi here on dinner time and they always serve good but this time we Went on happy hour 3 pm to 5pm and they serve food really low quality. You can barely see fish on it. I order dragon roll and eel on top was so tiny and cucumber salad looks nasty n messy . All the sushi we order came with big chunk of rice. I guess they serve happy hrs like that coz it's 20% off from regular price. And other things i notice is once you put 2nd round sushi order they alway put more rice and less fish. Disappointed"}
{"text":"I used to hate sushi but this place turned me into a sushi lover. Absolutely incredible food. Quality is impeccable, service is always great, there's usually a decent wait but it's because this place is incredible!! I refuse to get sushi anywhere but Oyshi! I've told all of my friends about it and they're all huge fans. Any one who's eaten here can attest to how fantastic this place is!! I wish I could remember our waiter/waitresses names but they're all awesome! Must try!!"}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi places in Vegas. The food was great! I love the fact that you can get so many options at this restaurant for the all you can eat. The had a great selection of appetizers like rib eye steak, agedashi tofu, shrimp tempura, etc. all of which I thoroughly enjoyed.   The nigiri sushi was just the right size. I appreciated the smaller rice portions which allowed me to order a variety of things without getting too full too fast.   The service is a bit slow, that's the only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5."}
{"text":"Well I have raved about this place before but today I was sooooo disappointed  the food as always was great so keep it up chefs but as for the waitress we had well that's heads a totally different direction...  The place is always made by the environment around and today we definitely did not feel welcomed   The hostess is greeted us and showed us to the table with a smile but that is where the courtesy ended...  We waited 15min to get asked for drinks, another 15 to order then even thought we were doing AYCE we waited 35 min to be able to add to our order at this point we felt ignored considering there were only 6 other tables occupied around us. We decided to cut it short and just go straight to dessert, we figured some ice cream could make us feel better, but upon ordering our desserts my hubby was given a creme brûlée when he told our waitress he wanted the berry parfait, it would have been fine had she just apologized when we brought it up to her but she says I pointed to the brûlée, ??? Well being that he ordered his own dessert we just looked away...at this point upset and confused we just paid our bill and left.... Sorry but no matter how great your food taste a staff with bad attitudes definitely brings your score down...  Sorry to say we won't be visiting this location anymore... Our best advice, perhaps order to go if you wanna try them out!"}
{"text":"Oyshi has an amazing menu, top notch service, with a clean, and contemporary setting! We have been multiple times for lunch, and dinner with consistently great food! We will continue to make this a biweekly tradition!"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi on the SW/West side of town. Thankfully I don't live to far so I frequent often. But if I didn't this place would be worth the drive. You can't beat the AYCE. I hate when you go to an AYCE sushi restaurant and almost every roll tastes the same. If that's your thing don't come here because everything you try will be different, fresh and so good!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight just to try it out.. not worth all you can eat sushi joint. I don't even know if you can call it Japanese food, not the authentic one. Sadly the food is not good! We wasted $90 for food that we couldn't eat. If you know sushi well this is not the place for you. Very disappointed. We will never come back.  And to answer to your question. Yes, we did try a bunch of appetizers and my review will still be the same. From the sauces, to deep fried stuff, very disappointing. Sorry to say this but there's much better sushi joints out there."}
{"text":"Really great sushi! Very nice place & the people are great. It has become my new favorite place. Try the bonsai roll."}
{"text":"Second time there and both times food was great, love the environment but service is lacking big time. I thought the first time maybe just short handed on help. Nope, same bad service again. If the waiter would slow down a little and pay attention to customers, I'm positive he would get better tips."}
{"text":"A little more pricey than most other sushi bars, but the music and atmosphere is great! One of the more trendier sushi spots on the SW. Happy hour specials on fri and sat from 12 - 2am. Good spot to take a date!!"}
{"text":"Oyshi sushi have the best sushi in this area .there is a big variety of sushi , sashimi and rolls . The restaurant looks very nice and  clean . The service is good ,too. I recommend this place to everyone . You will Not regret ."}
{"text":"Oyshi Sushi is the place to go when you have that sushi craving! The service and staff is always so nice and attentive our server Johnny was amazing and always made sure we were satisfied. The food is always fresh and the presentation is phenomenal Chef Ed is awesome, definitely recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE sushi guy. So much so that spending over $150 isn't out of the question for some legitimately good fish.  I came here at the suggestion of my friend who had previously enjoyed it. The decor is very hip and showed a strong traditional Japanese aesthetic. An eclectic mix of hip hop was playing in the background.   So far so good....  Now here's where things went down hill. My friend and I ordered our rolls and appetizers. Soon after the waitress left our waiter arrived with our edamame. I politely asked her if I could get an extra pair of chopsticks. It technically wasn't an extra pair as I never received a pair but no biggie right? Wrong! The server was rude and asked me if I was sure. As if I had reason to lie. Dude, I don't have utensils, who cares if I got a pair or not, give me an extra pair.   Apparently though asking me if I was sure wasn't enough. She looked under my menu and all over my plates to see if I hadn't \"misplaced\" my chopsticks. This left a bad taste in my mouth. It would have been more polite, expedient and professional to simply give me an extra pair. I swear I'm not stealing your sticks lady!  Another point that rubbed me the wrong way was the fact that in the 30+ minutes we were there I only got a refill on my drink during the last 3 minutes of our stay. That kind of sucked.   The food was ok. The mussels were pretty good. The reason I'm not knocking this place down to a 2 star review is because the food wasn't horrible ans because our original server, who I can only imagine 'sensed' we weren't having the best experience, tried her best to save the night. Too little, too late. Although I do appreciate the effort. You rocked.  Doubt I'll be back. If you want good AYCE sushi go to Goyemon. If you want really, really good a la carte sushi go to Yummy Sushi Grill off or lake mead and the 95.  Final word: exiting the restaurant i couldn't help but notice their B health rating. Now B isn't bad but an A is the standard and pretty much expected of any restaurant. If I could I'd give this place a 2.5/5."}
{"text":"We love this place. We have gone to some other \"must go\" AYCE sushi and wondered why we ever strayed. The fish is extremely fresh...especially for being in a desert.The atmosphere is great. We recently had family from out of town and brought them here. They loved it.   You will never feel rushed or timed here,  which is a huge plus in my book. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that sometimes the service can get a little slow. But if you love sushi, then this is the spot."}
{"text":"We had a table of around 20 people, so the table was split between two waiters. We all got the AYCE dinner. Our waitress really sucked. It took an hour or so for our rolls and sashimi to come out. We've complained numerous times to her and she kept saying, \"It's coming. The sushi chefs are working on it.\" The other half of the table with the other waiter had all of their rolls and sashimi out already.... we all ordered the same stuff! They were already on round 3 and we were still on round 1!!! Wth.   The Uni was not good... looked old and dark. Fresh uni is supposed to be light yellow/orange color but this was DARK orange/brown. It tasted as if it had been refrigerated for a long time. Overall bad service and the food was not good. The only good thing was the creme brulee and ice cream."}
{"text":"Everytime I come the Oyshi it is a pleasure..  Whether you want to do AYCE or Sashimi or just have a snack this a great place. There are not a ton of rolls to pick from but their menu is perfectly sized because the rolls they have...are all great. They also do not overload you with rice.  The customer service here is also top notch and what you shoud be used to in good establishments. This place does get very busy during peak hours so plan your trip wisely and enjoy."}
{"text":"They had me at all you can eat sushi! Anytime I come back to Vegas, this place will be a must go to for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This is a great place for AYCE sushi. Not only do they have a wide variety of rolls, I love their appetizers. The service is ok, not great, but not bad."}
{"text":"I love the food at Oyshi but the service is incredibly slow. & of course it makes it worse when they have a full house too. Luckily both times here I had nice waiters though and when the food FINALLY came after what felt like over 30 minutes, it was delicious. The warm sake was also really good!"}
{"text":"Did the AYCE and it was so worth it everything tasted great I will definitely be back again ! 4 stars because they don't offer sushi happy hour"}
{"text":"Oyshi Sushi is a smart kid with ADHD.  We went with a good sized party and reservations. Got placed in a side room. The decor is solid but nothing spectacular. The party, with the exception of one tactically frugal individual all went All You Can Eat (AYCE).  Two things: 1) The sushi was great. Fresh, well put together, largelly plated well and highly satisfactory. Nothing mind blowing, but great stuff.  2) They brought it out seemingly at random. We'd not get rolls we ordered and get other rolls instead, no explanation. The waitress was reading our requests back and she appeared to be writing them down, but the correlation between food requested and food delivered was .71 tops.  Bizarre Food Fail: Surf and Turf was ordered. Turf and Turf was delivered. Apparently the shrimp staged a daring escape.  I will return here, but largelly because it's five minutes away and my friends have low standards."}
{"text":"We get into Vegas Friday evening, checked in, and began our weekend off with a night of debauchery.  Food porn at Oyshi. Yessiree, four hungry men and a AYCE Japanese food? This is gonna get ugly fast, real fast. We get there and it's packed. A nice waiter greeted us and told us it might be a while. 20 minutes. Shit, thats it? His reaction made it seem like an hour or 2. Dude! We'll wait.   The restaurant is nicely designed with modern furnishings. Its set to look very relaxing like a lounge. Like Gerald S pointed out, it's not set up well if there's large groups. The good side is that it doesn't feel overcrowded.   The AYCE is probably the best and only way to go here. There are so many items to choose from and the quality was not as bad as I thought it would be. They do limit the expensive stuff like uni, amaebi, and raw oysters, but it was well worth it. The sushi was very well made and fresh. Their sushi cuts are very generous. They hardly give any rice, so it was perfect. Everything was awesome, from the salmon, tempura, ribeye, and unlimited green tea or vanilla ice cream!!!   Like hawks, we swooped down and attacked everything. Nothing was safe. We washed it all down with hot house sake ($7). For $25, I would do it over, and over, and over, and over, *deep breath*, and over again. The food came out slow, it was expected because they  had a full house. The service was simply awesome. If it's a Friday or Saturday, give them a call to make reservations. We left hurting and sat in our car like beached whales.   You may have defeated us Oyshi, but we'll be back. Back with bigger and hungrier guys. *waives fist*"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would!  The worst sushi I've ever had. It was falling apart, it had no flavor and very low quality. Even the hot green tea they brought us was burnt.  Our waitress ignored us and we were only able to order from her twice. We didn't even have water to drink until the end of the meal and we had to ask for it twice from two different waiters.   I'm hate leaving bad reviews but this place seriously sucked, what a waste of money! NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Great food, I'm very picky on sushi, and for an all you can eat place  this is pretty bomb!! You can pick any thing from sushi and appetizers and dessert"}
{"text":"Sushi, Sake & Fun! This place is great! Fish is so 'ono  I've been here multiple times and the service is always great! Definitely come and check this place out if you haven't!"}
{"text":"The ayce sushi doesn't taste bad, but I can't say the fish is really fresh. One of the uni we ordered smelt. Oysters tasteless and full of sands.   Very slow service. And somehow the waitress always seemed to want to be your enemy in anyway she could. It could be that she was having a bad day, but she seemed unwilling to separate that from work.   Was very disappointed after reading so many great reviews."}
{"text":"I'm not too sure I agree with the bad service comment people have mentioned, but then again maybe they've stepped up their game since then....But I experienced great service and the sushi was the best I have had since moving here from SoCal. Plus the price was pretty decent for all you can eat. Make reservations on weekends though as there may be a long wait."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and my last. I've been eating sushi for over 14 years and this is a small step above supermarket quality. To judge sushi I base it off of its simplest form, nigiri.  2 components, rice and fish. None of the fish here tastes fresh and the rice is so dry that it gives the nigiri a weird texture. It's almost as the rice is undercooked and underseasoned.    The rolls are weird and although imaganitive, unappetizing. The combinations don't go together and don't sound like they would.  Who wants mushroom and asparagus in their sushi????  Bottom line is if you want real sushi, don't come here.  If you're with a group of people and looking for a place that will have something for everyone then go ahead and make a mistake and come here.  If I ever have to come back with my friends I won't be eating."}
{"text":"I don't know why I ate here, I guess I was in the area and craving sushi at 11pm.  I was excited when I saw that the menu was slightly different than the Oyshi on Sahara.  Unfortunately the food wasnt.  The oysters and muscles were bland. The fish all tasted the same.   Let's put it this way...there was nothing I ate that made me even think \"I want some more\".  Instead I found myself trying to figure out where to hide the dry rice and fish  I couldn't stand eating."}
{"text":"Wide variety of food choices. Sushi was delicious and beautifully plated. Ver nice employees. FIRST TIME TRYING SOJU. Yes I got a little tipsy. I suggest the \"White Peach\" it's fruity and doesn't taste much like alcohol. Get a glass unless you're with a large group because it's a BIG glass 0.0 came here for lunch. Take advantage of the all you can eat. So get here with a big appetite.  They have fried veggies; yummy oysters!! And I recommend the Seaweed salad !! you'll love it ! Does not taste salty and gives the sushi that extra oomf :)"}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give this spot a 5... Blaring. House. And. Electronic. Music... Even on a weekday, during lunch time. I just don't get it?! I mean I can get down with some EDM, house, dub-step and whatever else they play, but it'd be nice if they can switch it up once in awhile.  On to the food. Double Screaming, Red Rock, High Roller... I mean I can keep going. So many yummy rolls. Definitely worth it to get AYCE. Just don't overdo it and look like half the people I see in there. Hunched over the table, sweating, trying to finish that last roll they regretted ordering in the first place!   Wait, that was me last time. Hahaha"}
{"text":"Fuck this place!  I can't believe I'm actually paying to eat here. If it wasn't for my kind hearted girlfriend this place would not be getting my money. We won't be back. Played shit music too."}
{"text":"It was my nephew's HS Graduation and it's our first time to eat here at Oyshi Sushi. We reserved one of the party room for 17 people. The sushi and rolls were the best. It was fresh and delicious, and most important the service was quick! We will definitely return to dine here again.   FYI - Dinner all you can eat  (Sat) was $27 each. We had 3 kids (age 10 and below) and they ordered the chicken teriyaki ala carte and it was okay with the restaurant. Most All you can eat sushi restaurant won't let kids get the ala carte and instead would require to pay the full buffet price so I definitely recommend this Japanese restaurant for kids who are picky eaters"}
{"text":"Not much time for a full review, but I visited here on the weekend after strolling the Harbourfront.  This small restaurant had intimate curtained booths and served up fresh sushi/ sashimi and a great tasting seafood Udon for a wonderful price.  I HIGHLY recommend the Sake Sashimi for those other Salmon lovers. Nothing like a slice of buttery fresh sashimi."}
{"text":"I went here with my Girlfriend last night, as she had wanted to revisit this place for some time, having visited herself once months ago.  I'll start off by saying I read a few reviews below and have to agree with something many have said and that is that you tend to have to wait a bit to get your orders in and then get served due to how busy the place is. My advice come early or come late ;) there open until 2 am Fridays and Saturdays.  We both got the AYCE deal; I think the bill came out to $64 for that and the two cokes. The sushi was fresh and very flavorful. The sauces were amazing. We had the simply shrimp roll (my favorite of the night), a deep fried spicy tuna roll and a few others. I tried something new for me and that was a tuna roll with scallions, which was a more fatty part of the tuna, more subtle and slightly fishier flavor that she did not enjoy, but I did. We finished off with a roll that had garlic sauce and wow that was seriously garlic flavored, so if you are not that into garlic, stay away from anything with garlic sauce. lol  The wait staff was nice, but again it was so busy they were all over the place and we tended to wait longer then I feel we or the other customers should have.  The place was ok and worth checking out if, you are in the area, but if you live across town like me it may not be worth the trip."}
{"text":"We aren't from Vegas so whenever we come here we always pay this place a visit since they don't have these types of AYCE sushi in Hawaii especially for that price!  Kenny was our server and he does such a good job serving us. Last year when we came to visit he was also our server and we had the same great, friendly service from him as well.   The only con I could think of was that the uni was 1 serving per person, waaaah why? I love uni! Lol anyways thanks Oyshi for your great service every time we visit!"}
{"text":"So happy my friend brought me to this place. For an AYCE place I actually Loved everything I ordered. From uni to rib eyes n everything in between...it was delicious. Great price, food, and especially the service. Definitely will be back n this place is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We went with a group of 10 including 2 small kids for an early dinner at 530 on a Thursday. It was already packed. The service was very friendly but we waited over 25 minutes for our first round of AYCE. The food quality was ok but nothing to get too excited about. Prices were average. My biggest gripes were the layout- crowded floor and you have to walk through a wait station in front of the kitchen and not run into any servers to get to the restrooms...and the music. It was nightclub music- ok whatever- but it was as loud as a nightclub. The group consensus is that we probably won't go back. It wasn't a comfortable atmosphere and not worth that for the sushi."}
{"text":"The price was decent.  Service was great.  Sushi was the best I've had for an all you can eat place."}
{"text":"Honestly the only reason why it's getting two instead of one is because the inside interior and vibe is very fun. The sushi, absolutely disgusting. I don't mean to be harsh but absolutely gross. And for how much they charge for all you can eat you'd expect good sushi. The crab is fake, when we asked the waiter if it's not real crab what is it then he was stuttering and you can tell he pulled the answer out of his ass by picking random fishes that are in the fake crab. So 28$ for all you can eat and you don't even get real crab what on earth. When I got home I had the biggest stomach ache ever I had to rock myself back and forth to fall asleep because I was not feeling well at all. I am disappointed will not be back and have been spreading the word how disappointed I am."}
{"text":"So since we live around the block and were lazy we decided to give it another shot. Again sushi was ok nothing to brag about cooked food took forever to come! Waiter was horrible !  Won't be back for sure this time. I don't care how close this place is!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time we have ever walked out of a restaurant! We walked in and there was debris on the floor. We weren't greeted or seated right away. When we were finally seated, we were given dirty menus with dripping sauce on one and both were sticky and gross to touch/look at. Menu didn't have any salmon or hamachi collar or any riceless rolls. We settled on popcorn scallops, the Iris special, a \"lovers\" roll, and all the nigiri on the specials board. None of which looked super appealing and not what we would normally order. There weren't very many choices. I was super skeptical bc none of the people making the food were Asian. I'm a little biased since I think Japanese should make Japanese food, Mexicans should make Mexican food, etc. All the fish was old. The rice was not fresh. The sauces were unimpressive. My hubby drew the line at the seared garlic albacore. It looked more like jerky and smelled terrible. He took one little bite and spit it out. He told the server that we were sorry but we were very unsatisfied with the quality of the food. The one good thing is that she didn't put up a fight. We left. Date night ruined. Do not go here unless you are into cooked rolls only. Even then you're better off with supermarket sushi."}
{"text":"I got my sushi for takeout. I ordered cucumber rolls and vegetarian futomaki. I had a bit of trouble with them falling apart but the taste was good. I was especially impressed with the futomaki, which made up for the cucumber being a bit less fresh. The staff was friendly and helpful in choosing vegetarian menu items. The wait was reasonable. It was quiet and would have been an enjoyable dine-in location, from what I experienced. I received free edamame, which was a nice touch. The price was reasonable for an a la carte menu order. I spent about $12 for twice what I needed for a meal. I will definitely return to Oyshi sushi."}
{"text":"The AYCE sushi is one of the best I have had. A new favorite of mine"}
{"text":"$28 for dinner all you can eat. Ordered 2 orders (2 pieces per order) of the following: fresh scallops, super white tuna, salmon belly and unagi. Took them 45-60min to get to me. Not a lot of people to have had me wait for the small ass order I placed! Fish was chewy and rice was bland and hard/overcooked. Never again will I come here."}
{"text":"Understated, a bit like the restaurants that line quiet neighborhoods in Tokyo, and much like those restaurants serving homely, satisfying and affordable fare. The salad is obsessively fresh, the miso soup balanced, and the teriyaki hitting that sweet spot every time. If you live in the neighborhood, you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"EJ was an amazing server! On top of everything with a positive attitude. Service was great, as well as the food!"}
{"text":"AYCE sushi is equivalent to the happiest place on earth for me. I can't believe this was my first time here because they have so many appetizer, nigiri, and roll options. I'm seriously so impressed!   Sushi: great quality seafood. The fish to rice ratio is fair and not as generous as Sushi Neko, but the quality makes up for it. I tried the salmon, tuna, fresh scallop (A MUST), sweet shrimp, uni, oysters, and eel. Their appetizers are the best I've ever had at an AYCE sushi restaurant. I had ahi poke, shrimp tempura (crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside), and mussels. The mussels were the worse because it wasn't creamy or flavorful enough.   Desserts: AMAZING! They have more than your usual ice creams and mochi ice creams, like a variety of creme brûlées, tiramisu, etc. The green tea creme brûlée was more like a flavored whip cream in my opinion; I like mine more thick and creamy but still sweet and good nonetheless.   Service: Kenny was our server and he was fantastic. It was super busy when we came in, but he still found time to be attentive and catered to us. He made conversation, suggestions when we were hesitant and deciding on what to order, and my favorite items were from his recommendations. Thanks for not judging me when I ordered like 10 items as my first order lol.   Overall: Oyshi is on my top 5 AYCE sushi restaurants. I can't complain with great service and quality fish. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"great environment, great music (if you like techno), great food, great menu (some real good and nice signature rolls) , i took my girlfriend out there today and bill was 20.54 so prices are great, lousy service is its only downfall =/"}
{"text":"Loved my visit tonight, Kenny was an amazing server and his customer service skills are impeccable! He definitely made my group's dinner even more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Love going here,  sushi is the best of all the AYCE places.  Really like how they will spice it up and add extra hot sauces when I request it.  The spicy stuff at most of the other sushi places isn't hot enough to do the trick."}
{"text":"For a while, my sushi squad (it's okay to laugh) were coming here weekly - yep, it's that good.   Oyshi is super clean, has a chill atmosphere and a friendly staff who are quite accomodating.   The menu is chock-full  of deliciousness - and you'll find something for everyone, even the non-adventurous. I love the nigiri here - perfect portion size. The ahi poke bowl is great, and I love that they've got it on the all you can eat menu, whereas most places will only permit one per person. We always get a ton of nigiri and a few of the skirt steaks, cuz they are a sizzling plate of yum that can't be resisted.   Chef Daniel was our absolute favorite, so you could count on us occupying a large booth in the back every Friday night. Since he has moved on, we hit this place up at least once per month - as some things have changed, which is a bummer - but it's overall still a great spot.   Room for improvement here would be the hot tea. They give you an entire pot (which is rad!) but because the tea leaves are left to steep, it's oftentimes incredibly bitter by the middle/end of the pot, which makes me sad.   You know we'll be back. Every other Friday for the rest of eternity :)"}
{"text":"Great, fresh sushi at reasonable prices. All you can eat dinner for $26, plus free dessert to complete the meal. Only downsides to the AYCE is that 1) it doesn't include sashimi, and 2) if you don't finish everything you pay the $26 plus a charge for any remaining rolls. However, if you have one or two you that just can't handle they'll usually cut you slack. Service is decent and friendly. Overall a great hidden gem everyone should try."}
{"text":"This place has quality sushi at a good price and the staff is great. A hidden gem in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love this place. I normally get the AYCE sushi and always get my $$ worth. My favs are the Ono, Fresh scallop, Salmon and Yellowtail....heck they're all good.  Service is the bomb and i'm not sure if he's the owner or the floor manager but he's the dude in a shirt and tie, but he's a total team player. He's greeting and helping clear tables including taking orders if the waiter/waitresses are busy multi tasking. The game is always on and the atmosphere is lively and they open late. If you're craving of sushi and have a huge appetite, give them a shot."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Came here for the first time tonight.  The service is so sloooooow. The waitress was MIA all the time and NOT friendly at all. We would order and our food and wouldn't come to our table for so long. Don't come here before a show because you will definitely miss it."}
{"text":"I usually love Oyshi, but I was disappointed when I reserved the large room for a birthday dinner. While the food was amazing, it took a while for us to receive it and the service was not as good as it normally is. We had to ask for water and out check in the main room because it seemed ole our server forgot about us. I only had a group of 9. The food was amazing, but I wouldn't recommend dining in the private dining room."}
{"text":"Ate here for a quick bite before doing my nails next door. Ate some sushi and some seaweed salad. I have had some amazing sushi so I have yet to taste something that compares. So it was good but not something to remember. However the seaweed salad was great! They were very polite and sat us quickly because we were in a rush. Prices were good. I saw that they have all you can eat sushi. Clean environment and food service overall."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi! Go see Chef Ed he's awesome and make you feel at home and welcome and creates some awesome off menu sushi creations"}
{"text":"This place used to be great but it has completely gone down the drain over the last few years. I will never come again unless the  food quality starts to improve. The rolls are 80% rice and barely any pieces of good fish. The worst part is the smell. You leave there with your hair and clothes smelling like you just hung out next to a deep fryer for an hour. They really need to fix the ventilation problem. It's too bad because it used to be a great neighborhood option"}
{"text":"Love this place! Tried many different sushi places and no other has come close to the perfection of this place. Can be a really long wait, but well worth it. Only complaints are that club/techno music is always playing and that your clothes tends to smell like smoke. Favorite rolls are the lobster fair, atomic bomb, Kami-kaze, coco, Japanese garlic lasagna, and the Nyi roll. To go ordering is a simply easier way to go to avoid the crowds. Like to end the meal with the ever tasty berry parfait. Customer service is always friendly with a smile."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying I am incredibly disappointed this used to be one of our local favorite sushi spots until tonight. We made an entire night planned around meeting here after figuring out they were open until 10:30 PM we arrived at 9:35 PM and they told us they did last call for seating and would no longer seat anyone else a full hour before they closed I am highly disappointed in our experience and will not be back simply for the fact they wasted our time and night"}
{"text":"My husband and I, as well as my daughter and her family used to love to eat at Oyshi. I don't know if it's gone thru a recent management change or what, but we had an absolutely HORRIBLE experience last week. First, when we came into the restaurant and sat down, I noticed that the music playing was not only RAP music, but uncensored RAP. I heard the 'F' word a couple of times. When I asked the server if he could change the station he said 'It's Pandora and it's censored.\"  I told him I heard the 'F' word several times and he continued to argue with me. I had my two grandchildren and was horrified. Then the sushi came and it was terrible. Not sure what happened to this place but we will never go back and will tell all of our friends and family not to go there. What a shame."}
{"text":"This place has great fresh food, service is spotty... But if you are okay with that its a decent place to go for dinner"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places around. The food was delicious, and there's a wide selection of basically everything. We got Andree as our server and our group was in agreement that he actually provided one of the best service we've ever had"}
{"text":"really good sushi restaurant for those who like to eat a lot. The sushi is fresh and really good. Its a bit pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Service was good, the food was good but beware that the nigiri is alittle over filled with rice. The ratio a little big for the thin slices of fish. Other than that will be coming back for more in the future."}
{"text":"I love sushi and this was my first time here. All you can eat sushi? I said sign me up. I always, always try gyoza wherever I can and I wasn't disappointed here. The closest to my favorite restaurant. But unfortunately, the sushi was not as good. The spider roll was absolutely amazing but my next two rolls dynamite and catercheese left a lot to be desired. So overall good place. Nice atmosphere and attentive waitstaff. (could also order half rolls which they failed to mention right away) and decent food. I'd go again for the spider roll and gyoza"}
{"text":"Pretty spacey sushi place. I want to say the best sushi made in third place. All you can eat is the best deal in the house."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi. Great setting. Highly recommend for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Love coming to this place for my sushi fix.  The only complaint is the service.  Even on a slow day when there's only 4 tables filled the rest empty it takes them forever to get to you.. There's only ONE server that I actually like there.. She's fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Service is soooooo slow here!!! They do not have enough waiters on the floor! The food is alright between 1-10, I say a 6. Again, service is sooooooo slow, that's my ONLY complaint."}
{"text":"I simply cannot believe in all the times I've come here I've never checked or written a review, that being said this is long overdue. We literally eat here nearly every week. Our 3 young sons have great taste & lobs family sushi night! Their Cajun albacore is fresh & has the perfect spice to it and we seriously can't get enough of it! My favorite are the Double Screaming O & Tiger rolls, but also enjoy the Love Affair, Oh My Heart & The Kamakzi! We used to always eat the Spicy Tuna Crunch but stopped only because we try to avoid eating deep fried food all together. It's worth a cheat though! Dynamite Roll is another! Quite honestly, there's not much here that we've tried that we haven't absolutely loved. The hot tea is the perfect end to your meal with the dessert options included with the AYCE! Crime brûlée (my only complaint is they keep downsizing it, it's become about 2 bite dessert...maybe it's a 100 calorie choice) the green tea tiramisu is my current favorite!! Whatever you do, get AYCE & start trying different rolls. You won't be disappointed.  And finally the chefs & wait staff...what can I say, they're phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Incredible Sushi rolls by Chef Pedro Lozada! Best sushi I've ever had and I didn't have any raw rolls since I'm pregnant! Totally recommend this place and this chef!"}
{"text":"I tried Oyshi on 7/6/09 on the recommendation of a friend. Everything was great! I found my server to be very friendly. She was truly a delight and she was very helpful! I had the Hot Tamale, Love Affair, and Crazy Philly rolls. All were superb especially the Love Affair. While I had more, I won't bore with a complete list.  I will come back for the all you can eat again. It was every bit as good as I was told when the place was recommended."}
{"text":"My first experience with sushi in Las Vegas was at the original Oyshi on Rainbow.  I decided to give this place a try tonight as it's much closer to home.  I ordered AYCE and with iced tea and tax, the cost was just under $32.  Items ordered:  Sweet shrimp Uni Agedashi tofu Miso Spanish mackerel (nigiri) Salmon belly (nigiri) Yellow tail (nigiri) Dynamite (baked in a round pan not a roll) Sibuya (deep fried 5 piece roll with no rice) Lava flow (8 piece traditional roll) Green tea tiramisu  One of the rules is you can only get one order of uni and sweet shrimp per person.  I ordered those first from the appetizer section.  I'd pass on these two items again.  The uni wasn't that great and there was nothing special about the sweet shrimp.  The miso was fairly traditional.  The three nigiri that I ordered for the second wave were just OK.      Then the best part came.  The dynamite in a pan is very good.  It's a baked crab mix with scallops, onions, mushrooms, and shrimp with a yum-yum sauce.  It's baked and topped with the sauce and sesame.  Very enjoyable.  The Sibuya is a 5 piece--no rice--deep fried roll filled with spicy tuna, salmon, cooked shrimp, and avocado topped with smelt eggs.  The topping is yum-yum and eel sauces.  This had a good spiciness to it with the spicy tuna and the deep frying gave it a good flavor.  Finally, if you like a little heat, the Lava Flow is spicy tuna and asparagus inside and topped with seared whitefish and jalapeños with added topping of Nyi sauce and flaming chili sauce.  Tasty.  For dessert, I got the green tea tiramisu--a green tea cake soaked with green tea.  A good ending.  My server was Ray and he was excellent giving me some suggestions.  Service from the sushi bar was prompt.  I was brought a new iced tea just before I finished my first glass.  With some of the spicy food, you needed a cool down.  An OK dinner."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great! It was about a 25 minute wait on a Friday night, so not tooooo bad. Once we were seated we were promptly attended to. The menu has a large selection, which is great but makes for difficult decisions. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We got seated around 7 placed our order in by 7:15 and waited almost an hour and half to receive our sushi. The manager wasn't addressing the situation, other tables were also complaining about the wait time. Also the manager didn't apologize once but his employee came over to apologize."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in  Las Vegas!! Highly Recommend Oyshi! The service is incredible, everyone is super nice and welcoming! the food is amazing! Love it all!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the location on Sahara for a couple years now, but I have to be honest that the location on Rainbow IS THE BEST!!!!  Service was a amazing, food was great as always and the prices are unreal.   We recently moved to this side of town and will frequent this location often.  great job!!!!"}
{"text":"I am SAD that I wasn't able to eat more because I went there after a night of drinking and was severely hung over. I love the prices and the fact that its all you can eat!! Tip: Remember not to leave any food or rolls left over because they make you pay for it. Also you cannot take food home so order carefully and arrive here on an empty stomach."}
{"text":"Just dine in with four people and they don't have oyster and uni, still charge for dinner price without those items. Very disappointed and never come back again."}
{"text":"Usually come here for a guaranteed good to amazing AYCE sushi experience but my most recent visit here today proved itself to be less than good let alone ok.  In short: the food and quality of it is amazing, not sub par by any means. I highly suggest their nigiri as well as their Red Dragon and Crazy Philly roll. Their ahi poke is fresh and the bed of seaweed salad it's placed in is on point.  However, the service (today at least) was below average. It's understandable if a waiter is slammed with tables, if errands for sushi bar needs to run, miscommunication with orders happen ---shit happens and waitressing is a tough job. But when you don't even bother to check your tables on the way of running food or when you're plain MIA for the duration of our longer than expected stay---It's simply no bueno. Our waiter Josh was sweet and was probably jam packed with errands but when it comes to an hr wait for the check let alone dessert orders...well hmm :/   Still love this place but maybe perhaps don't understaff?"}
{"text":"Setting: 11:30 on a Saturday night. SW Vegas. Rumbly tummies. Not too busy sushi spot.  On a budget so I opt for a teriyaki beef bowl instead of sushi. On the go so I grab the menu and let them know it will be take out.  After approximately 1 minute and 42 seconds of looking of the menu I am ready to order. I am very decisive, a trait I value in myself. I look around for the waiter who, just a minute prior, had served my friend and me some water.   5 minutes go by. Then 10. 15. Hello?  My friend goes in search of a waiter. He says he'll be over in a moment.  Okay. He finally comes over and takes my order. It's seriously another 15 or 20 minutes for some beef teryaki to be done AND it wasn't even that good. The meat was tough and not very flavorful. I dunno if it was on purpose or not, but whoever brought us our food didn't bring the check with it. Perhaps it was a mistake on their part or perhaps they brought it over as a silent apology for the terrible service. We just walked out before they could say anything. Does that make me a terrible person? It was 45 minutes for a to go order! I wish i was decisive about leaving and going somewhere else. I know I will never decide to go there again."}
{"text":"Love the food , the service is good , great atmosphere, really good Japanese lasagna..."}
{"text":"Great service and fresh sushi!!!!!!  Never fails that the freshness of the food is on point and the prices are reasonable. Family friendly. Quick service"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi place. Food is great with a very good selection of rolls. It is an all you can eat . My favorite rolls are love affaire / dynamite roll / tiger roll / volcano.Kevin the manager is very friendly and professional. Always takes really good care of us. Try to call to book before coming because they are very busy on the week end."}
{"text":"one of the best AYCE sushi places...not only in vegas..but anywhere.  they don't overload you with rice on the rolls, they let the fresh fish and their creative presentations speak from themselves."}
{"text":"Star # 1 - All you can eat sushi!  I mean that is a star in itself  Star # 2 - $26.95 for All you can eat sushi dinner ;) Good price because I can eat that much in sushi ...EASY!  Star # 3 - I have been to other all you can sushi places in Vegas and this one has the most variety.  The side dish list is much longer than others and offers some good stuff  Star # 4 - Customer service here is great. They treat you with great courtesy and always come back to make sure you are OK.  Star # 5 - Restaurant setting.  I mean they play a little bit too much trance and should maybe mix in the some r&b, or commercial hip hop, but the ambiance is still cool.  They have modern decor, and TVs in visible areas to watch ESPN...perfect! haha!  Come here hungry and beware how much you order.   Here are some good things I like to order:  Side dishes: -Surf n Turf -Baked Mussels -Shrimp tempura -Edamame (warm and with some salt! lol) -Green Tea Ice Cream -Green Tea Mochi  Sushi rolls: -Spicy Tuna Crunch -Spider Roll"}
{"text":"I have been going to this spot for a couple years now and the food and sushi chefs never disappoint. The last two times I have come in, the hostess has skipped my guest and I and has seated people who came in after us first. When it happen the first time I contributed it to it being busy. But when I came in Friday night, it was pretty slow. We gave our name to three different hosts that came to the podium. We even just asked to sit at the sushi bar. They needed to clean it and they would seat is is what they said. Well another couple that walked in ten min after we did came up to the podium and the girl sat them at the sushi bar first.  When we finally sat, I told the girl that this is the second time it is happen and she looked at me in disgust laughed and went back to the podium. Hungry and wanting to just hang out with my room mate, I let her finish her shift as I enjoyed yummy sushi and laughed with the chefs."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience so I may have to revisit this at a later date.    We sat at the north end of the restaurant with one long table.  There was about 16-20 of us doing all you can eat.  From looking around I didn't think the decor on our end of the restaurant was complete.  The dishes were good.  I'm in love with their oyster dish.  The only problem i had was that what ever we ordered, the food went to a random spot on the table.  We were forced to share.  I have no problems sharing but let me have my cut first especially since I don't like some sushi rolls with certain ingredients in it.  Hence, that's why I don't order the whole menu.    Food is 4 stars, staff is 4 stars, service is 3 stars, price is 3 stars.  So for now, 3 stars until I revisit!"}
{"text":"Overall everything was fine, the food was good, sushi chef Daniel was good and knowledgeable, but tell the server to shut up already.    He kept telling us that we should go to SLS's K***** and eat at his other job because the sushi and fish was so good there.  Every time he stopped by he would bring it up.  Soooo annoyinggggg.    Anyways, I did the all you can eat so I had many different types of fish while my friend ordered pork belly by recommendation of Daniel.  Everything was good and we had a little extra to take home.    I like this location a lot better than their original but lay off the annoying upsell of a different sushi establishment!  Geez."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars for our first outing at Oyshi Sushi!  For a Holiday lunch in December, my family and some friends dined at the newer Oyshi Sushi on Sahara.  Our initial choice was Makino's (which isn't THAT bad) but we figure, \"What the Hell?  Let's go try something new!\"  Off to Oyshi it was!  On our weekend lunch the place wasn't overly busy thankfully.  Our party of 11 was seated in their more private party room towards the back of the restaurant.  Lovely décor!  Except when we looked at the HUGE mural in the party room and put it all together...it's a Japanese dude...somewhat naked!  Ha Ha Ha, but hey, at least it didn't faze us from some awesome eats.  Because we couldn't decide what to order from Oyshi's menu, the adults just ended up getting the all-you-can-eat.  And at $21 per person for lunch...it's a FRIGGIN' steal!  I mean, if you're gonna order more than one roll (which can average over $10 each easy) then this option is the way to go.  Also, if you're a sushi piggy like me it's the ONLY option!  You can guarantee each of the rolls I chose to try were in the upper price vicinity, probably around $12 per roll.    With Oyshi Sushi's all-you-can-eat menu you ALMOST get free range of the entire menu.  Most of the hot items and signature sushi rolls are available for you to order.  Only thing not on the all-you-can-eat?  Sashimi and sashimi with rice...of course.  But that's OK because there is so much to eat.  And eat we did!  I felt so bad for these folks because I just kept on ordering sushi roll after sushi roll.  With just the four folks in my family, we EASILY ordered at least 12 signature rolls!  Oinkers!  And that's not including the hot dishes we ordered of the menu!  You can see how getting the all-you-can-eat saves you a bunch of $ when you are an avid sushi eater.  I estimated our total without the all-you-can-eat option - I would have spent over $175, not including tax & tip!  Yowza!  OK, so this is just to show you some of the things we ordered off of the menu (and to show you how Fatty McGee we really are when it comes to sushi):  -Tiger Roll ($12) -Oyshi Roll ($13) -Love Affair ($13) -Dynamite Roll ($11) -Volcano ($10) -Lobster Fair ($13) -Rainbow Roll ($11) -Spider Roll ($9) -Red Dragon ($11) -Monster Roll ($14) -Premium Spider Roll ($12) -Ahi Poke ($7) -Tempura Shrimp ($7) -Yakitori Beef ($4) -Edamame ($5) -Potato Croquette ($4) -Gyoza ($5)  See what I mean??  We ordered all that (for just FOUR of us), and it doesn't include multiple orders of the same sushi roll!  Add that up right there and see the savings!  Save some money AND eat well!  How can you get any better than that!?  Quality = Good!  Sushi rolls were all made to order so they were cut fresh for us.  The fish was fresh that day, no fishy smells.  The sauces were kept on the light side which I appreciate because after a while everything starts tasting like eel sauce if you're not careful.  Sushi rolls were of a nice size as well, definitely bite size but not tiny at all in order to save them money.  Rice to fish ratio was on point and very generous.    At the end of the meal (which literally took us over TWO hours) you also get your choice of one dessert.  Only ONE you say?  Yep, and I have no problem with that.  By then you are most likely stuffed like a turkey after all that rice you've consumed.  So ending the meal with something light, like a Mochi Ice Cream, or a slice of Green Tiramisu?  No problem.  I'm already feeling bad since I think my family alone ripped you guys off!  Service for our party was great considering our party of 11 was taking up space and time.  Luckily our poor little Japanese server was up to the task of our large ordering shootout.  As a mention, parties of SIX or more are automatically charged 18% gratuity.  Boy did she earn it!  We actually tipped extra over the 18% to show how much we appreciated little her serving our entire party (seriously this dainty girl was no taller than 4 feet 11 inches).  We were eaters for sure!  Combining the other folks in our group, we easily ordered at the very least 25 sushi rolls.     Will I be back here again?  Yes, yes I will.  Oyshi!"}
{"text":"Having lunch here with my sister and it is so yummy. Baked rolls on point, and so happy they have something besides shellfish in them. Our waiter is amazing, and he is always checking in on us."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner, a birthday party, and a graduation lunch and it was yummy! The waitress was nice but she did forget my drink while i sat there for 30 min thirsty while everyone had their drink! but other than that the food is DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is the best sushi place I have ever been to and this is coming from someone that's from California! Their all you can eat appetizers are so delicious and great price! And the rolls are perfect size, amazing flavor and the service is attentive and very polite. I need one of these in California!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! Maggots on the sushi. Health department needs to inspect this place. Restrooms is so dirty even the curtains going to hallway is so nasty stained."}
{"text":"Non sushi lover but loves the food here, there's so much to eat non sushi and it's delicious, I had to do the all you can eat, I couldn't get enough of their teriyaki and steak. It's a nice yet fancy feel on the inside. I will be coming again and again when I have a craving for some oriental cuisine."}
{"text":"Oyshi is my favorite spot for sushi in Vegas.  They are open until 2:00am to satisfy those late night sushi cravings.  They have two VIP/ private rooms for parties.  We always do the all you can eat. There are a lot of appetizer options that are included in the all you can eat.  Just be aware that they WILL charge you if you over order and have a lot leftover. So pace yourself! Each roll has a description including they ingredients used. So it is easy to avoid rolls with certain items you may not like."}
{"text":"IN THEIR DEFENSE, it is Christmas Eve. That is my only disclaimer. The service we received was horrendous and there is nobody to blame except the owner because evidently she was also our server. I understand it is a busy holiday evening. However, we called prior to arriving and asked if they were  busy amd whether we needed to make a reservation. We were assured that they were not busy and we could just walk in. Once we arrived, we were informed that they were tremendously busy and we must wait at the bar. We proceeded to sit next to a minor and her father at the bar (which specifically states nobody under 21 is allowed.) Thereafter, once we were seated and orders placed, we were ignored- plates never cleared (AYCE) and water not filled, despite us asking. The mere reason for giving 3 STARS is due to the Sushi Counter chef, Pedro, whom made an otherwise disappointing experience tolerable.  We will contunue to visit the Rainbow location. Merry Christmas."}
{"text":"Lets see All you can eat appetizers:  Might just go back to Vegas just for this: $21 dollars a person.  The appetizers comeout pretty fast.  The sushi is slower.   List of normal stuff we got, Spider Roll, Rainbow Roll, Tempura, Chicken Yakitori, and Edamame.  They have a good list of Baked Sushi too.   You can't get Sashimi but I got something just as good.  Ahi Poke.    The Sushi is made to order.  We we're full and it was really worth it.  You do have to finish most of your rice with the Sushi.      And to top it off 1 dessert.   We are definitely going to make this the go to place whenever we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"You know how there's good imitation crab meat and then there's bad imitation crab meat? Oyshi serves the latter. It was very disappointing.   I suggest sticking to the nigiri rolls, or the traditional sushi rolls. None of that spicy tuna stuff, or anything with cheese in it. Traditional is the way to go. We ordered two rolls that were non-traditional, and we found that to be a very bad idea. On the other hand, tuna and salmon were not fresh the day we went (salmon was more fresh, but still...). It worried me.   My favorite thing on the menu that night were the ama ebi (sweet raw shrimp). They were probably one of the freshest items on the menu. For this alone, they get another star because it was unique. I've never had this before at another restaurant.  Why did no one listen to me when I suggested Kyara for Japanese tapas instead?"}
{"text":"Slow service. Food is subpar nowhere near top quality sushi. Wouldn't go back.  Sumo sushi 2 waaaaaaay better"}
{"text":"My family and I went here for lunch today.  We all chose the AYCE option.  It was $21 for lunch and included almost everything on the menu (no sashimi).  My husband ate 8 rolls!  The food was fresh and came out at a nice pace - which gave us more time to relax and talk with each other.  We were not rushed and there was no time limit, like there are at AYCE places.  I don't eat fish - or seaweed - and was surprised that there were so many choices for me to do the AYCE as well - terriyaki chicken, gyoza, egg rolls, miso soup, salads, vegetarian rolls (with soy wraps), and beef plates.  I highly recommend the Grilled Beef Asparagus - thinly sliced beef wrapped around an asparagus spear and grilled with a light, sweet sauce on top.  Each AYCE lunch comes with 1 dessert - I had the chocolate creme brulee - absolutely fantastic!  Service was good.  Vangie, our waitress, worked at our pace.  She gave us time to look over the menu in full, made some very tasty suggestions, and was able to answer all our questions about ingredients and what was included.  Any time we accidentally veered off the included choices, Vangie let us know and suggested a similar item from the included choices.  She was very patient with us and really kept the food coming out while giving us our space.  If you go - ask for her.  I read some reviews where the server just didn't come back after awhile, not Vangie!  As she saw our plates emptying, she returned to ask if we wanted more, clear off used dishes, and refill beverages.  Oyshi is definately going onto our list of places to return - often and soon!"}
{"text":"If you work late or decide to crave sushi last minute, I highly suggest you DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION. The Sahara location has a tendency to close over an hour before their closing time. This has happened to me on 3/3 occasions when I've arrived there around 9:45pm (even though their closing time is 11pm on weekdays). I'll walk in, then they'll tell me they're already cleaning so we can't eat there. Just avoid this hassle and go straight to the Rainbow location. The food there is the same and the staff at the Rainbow location is excellent!!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad this location is open! I love Oyshi and this one is so much better than the one on rainbow! The service alone makes it a million times better. Best AYCE menu by far! Lots of options for the non sushi eaters as well (aka my boyfriend) it's still new so it's pretty slow but it's better than be neglected by servers at the one on rainbow!"}
{"text":"Sweet! 2hr time limit for AYCE..  Too bad you'd probably need all 2 hrs of it as service here is inadequate.    The restaurant was pretty much empty with maybe 5-6 other tables with about 5 or 6 front-of-the-house staff and 2 sushi chef.  The FOH would much rather have their backs toward us and mingle amongst themselves than to help the hungry (me). Kind of funny as It felt we were sat at the table with no server or porter assigned to it.  I ordered miso soup 3 times before it finally came out.  Our water and drinks were never refilled.  Sushi took too long and they just mediocre.  It was just one thing after another making it a very unpleasant dining experience.    Only thing i have positive to say about this place is that eel sauce is extra sweet without the heaviness and they offer dessert you normally wont see at other AYCE: green tea tiramasu and creme brulee.   My friends and I just finished eating sushi here since one of them recently reside in the area and he'd mention that we should have gone to Koji sushi just down the street instead.  I'd never been there, but i couldn't agree more."}
{"text":"Dawn C. and I decided to try a new place today for our sushi lunch, and decided on Oyshi based on the Yelp reviews and the fact that it was close enough to my work for me to get there eat and get back in around an hour.   Oh, am I ever glad we decided to try a new place today! Oyshi is great, $21 AYCE lunch with a huge selection to choose from. We sat at the bar and had almost impeccable service. We did to request plates (they did not bring them out with the wasabi) but everyone that helped us was so pleasant and upbeat, and our drinks were refilled without us ever having to flag someone down. Our check was also brought out before we requested it, which I always appreciate when I am on my lunch break.   We started out with some edamame, which is serves warm with a sprinkling of salt. We also tried the beef wrapped asparagus because a reviewer recommended it. It was ok, but I was there to eat fish not beef... so it was on to the rolls. We tried the Red Rock, a new roll called the Sexy something-or-other, Baked Philadelphia Roll and the Japanese Lasagna. All were very tasty. Some people may be turned off by the amount of sauce put on the rolls but I personally liked it. Rolls that come with sauces on top say so on the menu so if that's not your style, just ask the sushi chef to leave it off!   For desert we had the green tea tiramisu and the berry parfait. The blueberries on the parfait were still crunchy from being frozen, and the tiramisu wasn't really as good as I had hoped. But I was so stuffed from the sushi it's probably better for my figure that the deserts weren't to die for!   I will certainly be revisiting Oyshi on another lunch break in the near future."}
{"text":"Since Kai by my house closed, I have been trowling my neighborhood looking for a new sushi spot.  Ventured a little outside the neighborhood to come to this place, but the reviews were so good on Yelp, I had to go and see for myself.    Very friendly staff.  Always a plus.  Really bumping on a Thursday night.  It looked like a lot of 30 somethings come here for date night.  Definitely a good atmosphere. We tried to order all of the rolls that sounded spicy because that's our thing. Everything we tried was really good, just not quite spicy enough for me.  My favorite roll was the Volcano roll.  Good value for the AYCE price of $26. Will definitely return and be sure to request extra spice.  Still haven't found anything better than Sin City for AYCE."}
{"text":"Hadnt been to this location yet, after I stopped going to the Rainbow location for 2 years.  Well, disappointed is all i can say. Overcooked rice, hard and dry sushi fish, overly fishy taste from uni, frozen cold amaebi fried heads... the list can go on!  You want to have a cheap $27 ayce dinner? Then this is the place.    Stay away, unless you are not picky or dont care about getting sick."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner last night. 4 adults and 2 kids, the service was good.   For the value of what you pay, I think it was really good. We all got to try many things on the all you can eat. Everything was good. We ordered salmon and tuna sashimi off the regular menu also and it tasted fresh and really delicious.   We got dessert too, our two friends ordered the green tea tiramisu and green tea creme brûlée, they both liked it, I got the ice cream which was also good.   We would recommend it and would go again, I'm not sure why the bad reviews from others."}
{"text":"For sure a new favorite spot for AYCE! The fish quality was awesome!!! Great atmosphere, upbeat music playing, but not too loud. Stefan was a great server and very knowledgeable. Used to go to Goyemon, no more!"}
{"text":"The all you can eat is legit. The menu is full of options and they don't load their sushi with rice. The staff is great. We had Andre as our server. He knows the menu inside and out, and is very friend. Ask him for his favorites, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Sad to say, but this restaurant has gone down in service and quality over the past few years.  I dined in here with my family for my mom's birthday. My mom was craving her beloved \"love affair\" roll and green tea ice cream parfait so we decided to dine in here. Sadly, we found out towards the end of our meal that they didn't even have green tea ice cream. :(  Service: It could improve a lot. Our waiter made it seem like we were just another table to wait on. It seemed like he just hated his job overall, no smiles at all. We had to remind him a few times on some missing items.   We kept getting incorrect orders brought out to us and had to reject them probably twice. We either received 2x or 1/2 of our item orders. For example we only ordered 2 orders of amaebi, we received 3 orders. No big deal. Then maybe 5 min later they brought out 3 more orders of amaebi that we rejected. We ordered 5 orders of baked mussles and we only received 3 orders of baked mussles.  I'm not sure if it was a server/kitchen mistake, but we tolerated it.  We were missing two of our rolls and mentioned it to our waiter. He even admitted that our rolls might have been dropped off to the wrong table. At this point you'd think he would try prioritizing our rolls, but no he didn't. We told him we still wanted them (since we were still hungry from waiting for all of our orders still). He warned us that it might take awhile for our food to come out because the kitchen is backed up. That's not our problem that our food got dropped off to the wrong table.   We noticed none of the employees had any sense of urgency. Two tables next to us weren't bussed for an hour.   Quality of the food: Every time my family eats AYCE Sushi, we normally use a lot of wasabi and ginger. This wasn't the case. We received a watered-down wasabi and old ginger. Their nigiri isn't the freshest. My brother loves Uni and when he tried a nibble of it, he spat it out instantly. lmao. He said that the uni texture was jelly-like and tasted very fishy. Their \"love affair\" roll that we came for states that they use lobster. I honestly believe the \"lobster\" is just a bunch of crawfish tails. However, I think their meat is good though.  We had their grilled beef asparagus and surf and turf roll, and I think those were the highlights for me.   Cleanliness: When we first arrived, we were handed our plates for our wasabi and ginger. We were given two plates that were dirty that we didn't use. So I recommend checking guys' plates! The ladies' restroom needs to be cleaned and stocked. They were out of toilet paper and there were used paper rolls/napkins everywhere. Their bathroom checklist was public and I noticed they don't keep track of their bathroom checks. I'm going to assume they check it daily and forget to sign off of it, but considering their check list is open to the public eye.. it isn't a good sight to see for other dining patrons.  I'm giving them 2 stars because our past experiences from 3 years ago were all good and we didn't have any prior issues."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas a few months ago when a stranger told us about this place.  I remembered the name and we had time to try it out a few days ago.  We got there at about 8pm and on a weekday so it wasn't packed.  We had the best waiters though.  Service was excellent from the get go.  The people that work there are friendly and nice.  We ordered a few rolls and some appetizers to begin with.  We just took our time eating.  We weren't in a rush.  At times, we would take breaks and the waiter/waitress would check to see if we wanted to order anything.  All the rolls were fresh and tasty.  It's AYCE but they ask that you eat everything that you order.  Everything that we ordered was delicious.  We also ordered the seaweed salad and that was very nice.  The music is loud but it is also a place with a lot of energy.  I thought it was perfect.  We had a great experience and we will be back the next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"The BEST AYCE spot in town! Fish is incredibly fresh and such a great menu! Everything about this place is a plus. Even the other families and couples eating here are friendly. I think we made friends with 3 new couples in our last gisit"}
{"text":"Love the sushi here and the menu is great, but the past two times I've dined here, the wait to get our sushi was ridiculous. We waited over an hour for our first roll to come out, and watched people around us being served long before us, even though we placed our orders in first. I honestly think it's bc they are understaffed for such a popular establishment."}
{"text":"Love coming to this place especially when the server Kenny is there ! Best service ever when he's there ."}
{"text":"Just fyi Oyshi on Sahara service fucking blows. We use to come here alot...it's always been  slow..but food good... But watching people who came in after us get the same food I ordered before me. . .is not cool. Like i got something I ordered 5 minutes ago and still waiting for shit from an hour ago..update go to tell manager, gives me a card to come back and take care of everything.  We will not come back. Expensive 80 dollar dinner we didn't even get all our food before we got pissed and left! #youlostacustomer #60minutessinceiorderthesizzlingplate #Oyshi"}
{"text":"We used to be regulars here, but after the last 3 visits, we're finding a new spot. The food has declined and the customer service is even worse. The hostess, same one every time, literally rolls her eyes whenever someone enters and when approaching the podium, she doesn't even greet you with a welcome or anything, it's simply \"how many?\" And that's it. Then, after numerous of times coming here with our 1 and 2 year old, today, we are charged kids price for the all you can eat, when all the times before, each server did not even charge one cent for them since all they eat is the rice and miso soup (which tastes like salt water now.) The server we had was a woman today, Asian accent, long hair, and I don't even know her name since she never introduced herself and her name wasn't on the receipt. She was cold and couldn't even put a lid on a child's water cup right, which spilled everywhere when I picked it up. The food, although some were hits, majority were misses. The house salad tasted old, the cold tofu was room temp, the California roll was loose and not tightly rolled... Basically if you're ordering anything other than white rice and their ribeye sizzling plate, don't expect much! Overall, I am disappointed that this restaurant has declined over the 2 years we've been coming here, and no wonder for dinner on a Sunday night, there was more open tables than filled... And we still had to wait 15 mins to be seated!"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are great deals and the food is good too.  I don't come here often as it can take a little longer than the average lunch break but it is well worth it on days when I can afford the extra time."}
{"text":"I wish the sashimi was AYCE but it's okay. At least the sushi is.  I'd say, go straight for the raw fish sushi xD so good.  Except on busy days. Then they just serve u fat lmao"}
{"text":"My go-to sushi place.  The rolls are everything. Nuclear bomb, Chung hua, and the tiger roll are my favorite. The AYCE menu is delicious and extensive. I've tried plenty of sushi places in Las Vegas and this one takes the cake. I would give it more stars if I could."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to sample this southwestern sushi spot.  Restaurant design: very modern. Comfortable seats everywhere, very nice lounge with its own TV, huge counters at the bar. One of the largest interiors I've seen. The only weird thing is how low the armchairs in the lounge are. Luckily, we didn't have to deal with that since we didn't fill the table.  Service: consistent pacing throughout the night. Could be because we were the lounge table, but I'll take that versus sometimes being forgotten.  Picks:  Nigiri: everything was delicious through and through, even the tuna. The spicy tuna was a bit overwhelming for my sensitive palate. Smoked salmon special here is superior to Goyemon's special. Uni is the best quality other than when I tried Kaze's AYCE sashimi lunch. There were some issues with seaweed wrappers from different pieces sticking to each other though. Oysters: no real off flavors and haven't gotten sick yet, so that's a win for me Baked mussels: solid Fried calamari: fine Lasagna roll: didn't notice much difference with the inclusion of avocado, and good quality Parfait: really, really good. Fruits and crunchy granola made me really happy. Glad I made this my limit-one-dessert-that-isn't-ice-cream-scoops choice.  Passable:  Dynamite: pretty good, but the sesame threw me off. Surf n Turf sizzling plate: beef strips and shrimp on a bed of onions and cabbage. Not bad, but not great. Hot sake: average, I suppose. Best part was that it was a Mon/Tues 2-for-1 special.  Pans:  Popcorn scallop: pretty useless. Amaebi head: brain drained. I feel like they did this as a restaurant-wide strategy to appeal to a more mainstream palate (you can tell by how they let you order yum yum sauce on the side). Would've liked all off the flavors to be there. Ice cream: while the green tea was pretty good, the vanilla was not that impressive and the texture of both had noticeable ice crystals  Overall, I enjoyed the meal with a few notable exceptions. It's worth the drive if you want a change from your normal sushi spot. I'd probably come back to explore the rolls since we didn't really plumb the depths of that extensive part of the menu."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Oyshi Sushi. I had heard goid things about it, and the YELP reviews were mostly positive. The restaurant is far from upscale, and to my surprise the floor was quite dirty.   The size of the restaurant is fairly big and they really pack in the customers. The customer service eas good, but not great. The fish was very good though, and the restaurant didn t smell like fish. I would visit Oyshi again, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Very poor service. Took a long time just for appetizers. Rather go to the new location on west Sahara."}
{"text":"Great food, great price and Nice cozy place. Love that it's all you can eat but made to order. Buffet sushi never appealed to me so this restaurant was a wonderful find. Will go anytime we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place has a great all you can eat sushi menu. Everything on the menu is included in the price except for sashimi. I've tried almost everything on the menu and i loved it. Even the hot item menus were delicious! One of my favorites since it's real close to my house. Make sure you either go early or later since dinner time can have a wait around 7ish."}
{"text":"We come here often for all our friends birthdays and other special occasions. All you can eat, what's not to love. Service is outstanding. I have nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for sushi. The sushi selection is awesome, but if you're with people who don't particularly like eating fish, they have a ton of choices to choose from. Service is really hit or miss here. The restaurant itself is really clean with modern decor."}
{"text":"I think that Oyshi is one of the best AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas.  It is a bit of a far drive from the strip and from where I live, but it's worth it.  The AYCE prices are $21 for lunch and $26 for dinner.  The AYCE not only includes various sushi rolls, but also includes various items such as steaks, mussels, sweet shrimp, some nagiri choices, and dessert.   My Top Picks for AYCE: -Ahi Poke -Kamikaze Roll -Tiger Roll -Rainbow Roll -Rib Eye Steak (comes out sizzling on a hot plate about 6-8 oz) -Mussels (2 comes in every order) -Vanilla Berry Parfait   Oyshi also has a normal non-sushi menu such as teriyaki chicken, egg rolls, and a beef bowl, if you ever have any non-sushi diners in your group.  The service there is decent, some servers are friendly some are not.  I've never had a problem with trying to get a table here.  My only qualms with Oyshi is that they tend to play rave/techno music there that does not match the ambiance.  And they also automatically add gratuity or parties of 6 or more, when it is usually customary to add gratuity for parties of 8-9 or more."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places! The oysters are my fave aside from the unique rolls they have cause of the sauce they use. \"All you can eat\" is well worth it here & their customer service is great. Food takes a while to come out sometimes but it depends on what you order. So worth the wait though! One of the best rolls they have is the \"love affair\". You'll love it cause I do. :)"}
{"text":"Food is good, comparable to other sushi places in Vegas.   My friend came here once, and apparently the tip she left wasn't as generous as the waitress expected. We came back a few weeks later, and the same waitress had the nerve to send another girl over and ask us, \"so-and-so over there wants to know why you tipped bad last time.\" Excuse us!? If your service sucks you're not getting a good tip. Extremely rude and unprofessional question to ask."}
{"text":"got the AYCE... overall is good... sashimi r not included in AYCE, and cant get half order of the rolls..."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible! Was there for my birthday today and my husband waited patiently for an hour still did not get his food. AYCE . My daughter ordered California rolls which they forgot and finally after 30 min we mentioned it. This was the worst I will never come here again. We usually go to the other location. I didn't even get my dessert because my husband was so livid, which he had every right to be, get it together Oyshi! They said the manager stepped out. How convenient... Should always have a manager at a restaurant especially with the crap service they are giving out. I always post positive on Yelp this is my second review for a bad bad place. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Wow! My aunt was not kidding when she said we needed to try Oyshi but specifically under Chef Nick! He served the freshest, tastiest dishes plated perfectly for us and was so kind and thoughtful! I'm obsessed.   Thank you Nick! Mind blown."}
{"text":"Always able to get a reservation when I need and food is absolutely delicious. Favorite ayce sushi restaurant by far!"}
{"text":"The best sushi in Vegas hands down love going to this place all you can eat fine quality rolls and taste is amazing huge variety definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Always have a great time here. Our favorite chef is Ed. (Hi, Ed! From Alyssa & Kyro) he's personable and good at what he does. The service here is always fast."}
{"text":"Best AYE sushi place in Vegas!!! Make sure to sit at the bar!!! You can do happy hour and half rolls. The server was great he ordered his favorites for us!!! Come with a big group so you can share...."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! And with the all you can eat prices, it is a good deal for sushi. I went here Friday night with my boyfriend and another couple, and we all got the all you can eat deal for dinner ($26/person) and we were able to order over 10 rolls and some appetizers and sides as well. We definitely ate well over $26 worth of rolls."}
{"text":"Forget about the sushi restaurants on the Strip. Go here. Seriously.  Located in Enterprise, I was a little skeptical about this place because it's centered within a weird strip mall that had a veternarian's office, Dairy Queen, and a Korean nail salon nearby. Whatever. That don't mean SHIT when it comes to delicious sushi.  With a great all-you-can-eat dinner price and the craziest variety of rolls to choose from, I don't see how you would NOT enjoy your sushi-licious dinner here.  Even though we were only in Vegas for 5 days, we managed to eat here TWICE because we were like \"EFF THE STRIP!\" and wanted to eat to our stomachs' content without the glare of neon lights.  Crunchy Spicy Tuna Roll? I dream about eating it every day for the rest of my life because that would be a DREAM COME TRUE, YOU GUYS."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I came at lunch time and I've heard the time to go that is best is during dinner hours so I'll have to go back for that sometime soon. My friend and I came in for lunch and decided against our normal ayce sushi and decided to just start off with a roll each. Dragon and a spicy tuna to just keep it simple. We waited 30 minutes for our two rolls. They were not rolled well neither were the portions right. They were very difficult to eat with chop sticks due to the super loose rolling of the sushi. Because of the wait and low quality we kept our order to just one roll each. One positive was that my friend loved their Thai tea."}
{"text":"Great AYCE, huge menu, great staff. Can get half rolls on AYCE too, so you can have more variety"}
{"text":"Oyshi is a great place to hang out with friends and family during lunch to check out the fun atmosphere.  If you are a fan of sashimi, then this is the place to be."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb if you are a big eater! Which I am not but with three teenagers in the house they get their money's worth! The tempura rolls are my favourite and my wife likes the spicy tuna roll. Service is quick and the staff is friendly. They do have rules that if you don't finish you will have to pay extra for any uneaten item. So, make sure you clean your plates!  If you are a sushi fan I would recommend Oyshi be on your list of go to restaurants."}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight and it was amazing!!! Though they were busy, food was amazing! My BF and I had popcorn scallops, dynamite sushi, and red dragon! They were delicious! Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"I'm torn.  The sushi was outstanding and the All You Can Eat menu was expansive.  The service was terrible. There were many servers there on a Monday night and the place wasn't super busy. They kept forgetting about us and not once did anyone ask if everything was ok. We did the AYCE deal and after I finished a roll it would be like, 15 minutes before anyone asked for our next order. A few times we had to pester the bus boys to get our server because they were the only staff that was coming around. I saw the server at the table next to us check on them twice before anyone came to us even once. I understand if it's crazy busy and people are ordering sushi like it's going out of style, but I kept looking up at the servers standing around at the bar doing nothing but looking confused. Maybe they didn't know who had our table, I don't know. After we were done with our dessert we just sat there for another 10-15 minutes waiting for our check. Again, we had to literally get up out of our seats to find someone.  Any time I've done AYCE at other places, even busier places like Goyemon, the service has been fine. This was bad service to the point of being extreme.  Come on Oyshi, step it up! I really really like your sushi!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite AYCE spot for so many reasons. The selection is fantastic. The sparkling sale is homemade (green apple is amazing) the desserts are on point and there's more than mochi. Also, they're open until 2am (Rainbow location). Amazing rolls, fresh fish, great service, nice music, and amazing appetizers. An absolute must try!"}
{"text":"Glad to say that Oyshi Sushi definitely gave me a good first impression! Although, the reason why I took a star off because my friend and I had to wait for a long time to get our sushi, we were a little irritated. Then again, it was definitely worth the wait. Best sushi I've tasted yet! Can't wait for my second time; highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I went there tonight for a take out and it took them an hour to finish my order, plus it took another 15 minutes to be bagged.  I saw my order on the counter ready for bagging, but nobody was minding it.  If I did not asked about my order, it will be just sitting there.  They also forgot to put dressing on my sashimi salad.   Hence, the 2 stars."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy. Great service..prices are good...warning the calamari is gross. No flavor. I love calamari but i wont ever order thei calamari ever again. I had them take ut off my bill and sent it back and i never do that. So far everything else is good. I have been there about 4 times no other complaints so far."}
{"text":"Ed and James sushi chefs are the kings of sushi! They made us an Ahi Tuna with wasabi and special sauce on a bed of seaweed tempura in small bites as a compliment and it was something to come back for alone. These guys are here everyday besides tues/wed nights and they make up inspired dishes on the fly. The nuclear bomb is my personal fav! This place is a local must try!!"}
{"text":"All you can eat Oyshi Sushi.  It was good. Good quality. Anything on the menu goes.  But all the rules! One desert per person. Eat most of the rice. Limited raw oysters. Limited hand rolls, and all you can eat ..in two hours.   All for around 25 dollar a person for dinner.   I came for a bday dinner and we had a little room with dimmed lighting and trance music in the background.  Good customer service too.   It's just a little too strict to really enjoy yourself and to enjoy the company you're dining with."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been coming here for a few years. The fresh wasabi is really good. My favorite is the Cajun albacore which most places don't have. Plus the deserts are more than just mochi."}
{"text":"I wasn't really impressed with this sushi joint. Typical AYCE format, however, the rolls didn't taste fresh. The calamari was just empty breaded rings with tentacles here and there. At the end of the night, I ended up having more gas than a Texaco station. If someone lit a match, the joint would be flammable!"}
{"text":"I like this place not to busy when they open r 11:30am more people started coming in r 12:30pm when we were finally leaving. Great little place and sushi was so good and the service was good also. The green cold tea was OK I have had better. But all in all everything was really good. Going back again soon."}
{"text":"I am astonished by how friendly and knowledgeable the staff is.  I have had the most attentive and marvelous helpers. I would come back and recommend everyone come"}
{"text":"If you like sushi you'll love this place!  This is a gem! The prices are a little more than I'm use to coming from SoCal however the sushi is very fresh! Great flavors, a good selection and the ambiance is inviting. I've been here 2x and will continue coming here. They also have some out of the box desserts, the green tea cremé brûlée is decent. I'm a brûlée geek so I hoped for something amazing it was so-so. Over all great place though!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi restaurant near our house. We even take the slightly further drive just to come here. Ayce is on point, with great quality fish, awesome servers like Stefan, and a fun environment. Wish they had a punch card!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food always taste amazing. Only complaint is that the service is sometimes really slow. I waited nearly 30 minutes to get a simply shrimp roll when the restaurant was not busy at all. All in all ill keep come here just for the food."}
{"text":"My wife and I are fond of trying out new-to-us places to see if they're good and provide an alternative to our go-to place -- Oyshi Sushi is NOT one we'll ever come back to!  Not only is the sushi not \"oishi\" where every piece of sushi has more rice than fish, but the rice isn't even good sushi rice. It has a sweet offputting flavour that just drowns out the experience. If the goal was to stuff the patron full to lessen the AYCE experience, they have succeeded.  The service is where it really boils down to, this is Las Vegas, a place that has so many restaurants and eateries vying for patronage and sometimes the service, not the food makes or breaks it. We had to flag down servers several times to get in our orders, that is if you even get one to give you eye contact. And then the constant repetition of asking where the order is because after a server takes it doesn't , it never seems to make it to the kitchen. Whatever, if you want good sushi and a pleasant experience, Oyshi Sushi is not the place to go unless you don't mind waiting for your food forever with a sub par service.  PS. It's \"all you can eat\" as long as you order just one. SMH."}
{"text":"Love this place! In my own opinion, this is the best AYCE sushi place in Vegas! There are many options here, even if you do not like sushi. AYCE menu also included rib eye steak platters, and a variety of other item you can order in small portions. The AYCE menu also includes a dessert."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi I come here once a week and get all you can eat. You can pretty much get anything you want for lunch it's only $21 and it's really good food. I like coming for lunch because it's slower, this place gets pretty busy on the weekends. We like sitting at the sushi bar because you can order faster and the guys are super cool. Plus you can get half rolls. I love the house salad and they have an awesome sake martini :)"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh sushi. I recommend the happy hour all you can eat sushi. It's worth it."}
{"text":"The original Oyshi is my fav sushi spot but we love out on the reservation and it's just so very far! I was very excited when this location opened! We couldn't wait to go and we were NOT disappointed!! The prices are lower- The ambiance is clean and classy- The music was 90's pop and at perfect volume- The staff were all so polite and helpful making selections. The only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars is because they don't offer half rolls. My husband doesn't like a lot of the raw rolls that I order and it's too much for me to share his baked rolls. All in all... It was delicious and we will DEFINITELY be back!!"}
{"text":"Best All you Can Eat Sushi in Vegas! Not only do they include oysters in the deal, but the toppings are A1. The baked mussels are also a must have. We were accommodated where we wanted to be seated immediately. Our server, Stefan was super attentive, friendly and informative. Totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good sushi on the retail level of a condo building. There is ample seating space or it's good for take out. The platters come with a ton of variety of sashimi and rolls. All the fish is very fresh, and the prices are reasonable too. Great to satisfy that sushi craving without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Oyshi will always have a special place in my heart. My husband and I used to eat here when we were just friends. We would come at least once a month and hang out at the bar with David. Fast forward about a year...we finally went back to the place that brought us together.   We got here on a Saturday around 6 pm. Fairly busy but not packed. A lot of new faces, but David remembered us as well as the manager that runs the floor (not sure of his name). It felt pretty good to be remembered and it made the meal better! I cannot eat sushi right now, but everything looked fresh. My husband said it was good, but he didn't want to rub it in my face that I cannot eat raw sushi. Oyshi has always been on par with their fish and it definitely seemed that way on Saturday.   I was able to order items from the kitchen luckily since they have a wide variety of cooked items. Calamari is good with their 2 different dipping sauces and as was their gyozas. I can't remember what else I ordered, but everything was fairly good.   I will be back when I can get some real sushi into me again! Service has always been attentive and that hasn't changed. Oyshi is a winner!"}
{"text":"I've gone a couple times with a large group of friends for a birthday and we got seated in the secluded area away from the restaurant. I felt like they also purposely forgot about us more than half the time for our orders. Or they would bring the forgotten orders that we put in 3 times as a reminder, and finally appear after 1.5 hours when we are 100% full, then try to charge us for the uneaten food.  The best items on their menu is the Lobster Love Affair and the Vegas Roll. Other than that, meh.  The service is the worst here. Good luck trying to just order for take out, they will look past you for 20 minutes until you ask them for help and even when they finally do, they will still ignore you because they have short attention spans. Mind you, I was sitting at the sushi bar with a menu in my hand and grabbed someone twice and still was not given the time of day. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Strictly on service.  ate here yesterday and felt like we were very limited on the ayce,  our server kept on implying that our order was enough or \"it sounds good for right now\"  other than that  the guy that was cleaning up the tables and getting the dirty plates took a stack of dirty plates from another table and put it on top of OUR dirty plate on OUR table while we were eating OUR food, very convenient for the server but pretty gross for us and showed no consideration for us while we were still eating.   pretty disappointed with this oyshi location, i love their rainbow location and will probably just make the 30 minute drive out there."}
{"text":"The service was great! Sushi not so much.  My husband and I eat a lot of sushi and are very particular about the places we go to, so when we went to this one thinking it was going to be similar to the one on rainbow, boy were we wrong.  We always order nigiri and maybe a couple of specialty rolls and the ones we had gotten the rice tasted old and the fish was very stiff. We also ordered an eel roll and it was falling apart and overly dressed. Needless to say, we are definitely not coming back to this one and will just stick to our regular spots."}
{"text":"BOOM!!!! Best damn sushi joint in LV, hands down! Don't argue either....this place gets a 10. Their AYCE is ALWAYS fresh, and I dont think Ive seen or heard a compliment in the 20 times I've been here. Awesome vibe, highly reccomend."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Another AYCE place you can add to places to go for a good experience. Lots of fish choices, all really fresh. Pretty good specials to choose from. The service is always really quick and friendly. The rolls aren't all that great is the only small issue, but just same room for the Nigiri and the handrolls. Been several times now it's just consistently delivered."}
{"text":"Usually \"all you can eat sushi\" should be translated into \"you shouldn't eat any sushi\"... Happily, this place is the exception to that rule. The sushi chefs here are knowledgable, fun and skilled. The service here is fast and friendly even when this place is packed.  The sushi here wouldn't pass at the very top tier sushi restaurants in town (like nobu, shibuya etc.) but it is as good as the best normally priced sushi spots in town. Bottom line, great quality sushi and for $25 you can stuff yourself silly... Updated my review to three stars as the quality here has notably gone downhill in the last year... It's not unusual to have sushi come out cut inconsistently and sloppy. Also, service here has suffered. Hopefully push I gets its act together, but until then I'll eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Love Love Love ! Great all you can eat sushi! Clean! Good atmosphere open parking . Sometimes when busy they can be a bit slow or forget and order but the staff are always friendly and get it to you. Great variety of sushi to pick from and yummy Mochi. I recommend , why not give it a try"}
{"text":"Went here last night, food was OK. Server was great but food runner was extremely rude. Looks nice but everything else was EH. Especially for the price, I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Don't ever go with party of 8 or more! The service is terrible! They don't clean the table during the meal! Service is bad they have 1 waiter taking care a large party."}
{"text":"Very disappointed ! I came and order assorted sashimi dish which is $25, I told them that I dont like tuna and I want anything else except tuna! They told me that the chef says he cant do it ! I don't see how hard it is to replace tuna with other fishes ! Never come back !"}
{"text":"This is a great go-to sushi spot. Love the many choices of rolls, and that they offer half rolls. Wish they had real crab, but the items I have tried are fresh. We didn't do all you can eat because a few rolls already filled us up. It's an upbeat, young crowd, and we appreciated being able to watch the football game too! We'd definitely come back when we're craving sushi!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my cousin and wife for my first time, my wife's second time. At first glance it was a nice atmosphere. The service was good. We got our drinks right away. The downfall was our sushi rolls took quite awhile to get. The table next to us was seated after us and they got their food before our table did which was odd. In my opinion, the sushi rolls were ok. Nothing extravagant or didn't give me a wow factor. It wasn't plated to give a wow factor or to make you excited to eat it. Which is a plus for me. The taste was a typical sushi roll taste. Nothing exciting. Our server did give us a free sake since we were still engaged in convo well after we paid our bill, and he came out with another sake on him. Which was nice and unexpected.   Would I return? Eh I have had better sushi much closer to my house. Would I recommend? Sure. It's just another sushi place to add to the list."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the sushi was mediocre at best. The last time I was there maybe 2 years ago (and the last time I will be there) the service was just horrible. The waitress sat me in a booth with a stack of dirty dishes sitting right next to me in the booth next to me. I looked at her like she was crazy, waiting to see when she would move the soiled disgusting dishes. They stayed there my entire meal. I think I pretty much mentally tuned out after that, but my water glass was constantly empty. I drink a ton of water with my meals. Everything took forever to come and the bill, of course, took forever as well. There are too many sushi places in Vegas to come back to this one to be grossed out having to sit next to dirty dishes my ENTIRE meal.  Service is an F minus. If I were rating the food this place would get 3 stars."}
{"text":"I remember this being my favorite place when I was needing an after gym food sesh.  Back in high school.  It seems like it's gotten more unprofessional and not as yummy as. Before. Its a bit pricey and better looking than better tasting.  This isn't a terrible foodie place, but there are better priced and better tasting sushi joints in vegas"}
{"text":"Ate here for the 2nd time yesterday. Service is quick and attentive. Rice to sushi ratio is a good balance. Nice variety of rolls. My favorite appetizer was hiya yakko: a cold soft tofu topped with green onions and sesame seeds in a light sauce. It was simple and refreshing. My favorite roll was the Monster: soft-shell crab, shrimp tempura, with crab mix, topped with eel and avocado. It was so big I could barely fit the whole roll in my mouth. Note, they don't add cucumber to many of their rolls. AYCE is $27 for dinner, with dessert included. Reasonable, in my opinion. Becoming my go-to spot for sushi in Southwest."}
{"text":"ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI and they have a wide variety for the AYCE not just strictly California Rolls like some other places. The menu contains things like sushi, beef, oysters, etc. When you order, it's appetizer/ tapas size so you're usually left ordering more, and more, and more. The food is great, pretty quality stuff.   Atmosphere is nice, pretty modernized decor, nothing fancy but classy. I like that they have private rooms for those looking to have an event celebrated there. We went there for a friend's birthday and the room that we had fit about 8 people comfortably and even had a TV in there. We were able to watch a football game. I believe that there is another room that fits more people.   Service was great, they took real good care of us and even gave the birthday boy ice cream with a candle and sang happy birthday. The times that we sit at the sushi bar, the sushi chefs chit chat with you.   When we're craving sushi and know that we're bout to consume lots of it, we go here."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI BAR EVER. It was our first time there and I don't think I could ever go anywhere else again. Amazing sushi and the absolute best customer service I have ever had. Servers were very knowledgeable about promotions going on and made us feel so welcome. We did the Black Friday AYCE special and had 7 rolls (one of which the chef did half and half) and 2 orders of miso soup. Btw, be sure to get the J & B roll!!!!! We will absolutely be back soon. Great food, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"So the place is beautiful, the sushi is nice and all, but... My husband's rolls arrives after 40-50 LONG MINUTES! And he went for the \"all you can eat\" menu... What's that all about?!"}
{"text":"1st timer.. Food is off the chain..  From Ahi Poke, Attomic Bomb, love affair.. I wasnt a sushi gal.  Coming back for sure for the food and service"}
{"text":"When I went, I think they were only open for a few months. My friends really liked this joint and said I had to check it out.   The food was decent. Although we ordered salmon and got lox. Which I guess if technically salmon. Just not very Japanesey. They also didn't have negi-toro or shiso leaves or white tuna. Shiso is a very basic requirement!   Ergonomically mediocre. Like the counters are too deep ... for a sushi bar. The decor was still coming up. There was a ugly mural on the wall. Although, I did like the little pieces leading up to the bathroom, like little Basquiat post cards.   The sushi chefs were also quarreling behind the sushi bar. Our servers weren't very warm, but got the job done. They were all boys. I think half of them were from Hawai'i. Not that you have to be Japanese to know how to slice a mean sushi ... but it didn't seem these kids had much formal training. Just sayin' ...   * off the strip, non-casino"}
{"text":"This restaurant is right in my neighborhood and very convenient. They are reasonably priced and quick with Togo and dine in orders. I often place to go orders and on one particular night as always, I ordered sushi to go and waited..... There were 4 servers standing around chit chatting behind a \"wall\" which was merely a beaded divider. They cussed and spoke rudely about guests in earshot of guests, like myself. I work service industry and understand that on occasions you get rude and sometime intolerable guests and need to vent but speaking poorly about a guest or anything else on your restaurant floor is immature, unprofessional and rude at best.   You're open late, have great food and are quick with service..... I suggest your team be properly coached on the importance of guest relations and the impact one sentence may have on guests in the building."}
{"text":"I'be coming here to oyshi since there open back in 2009 best sushi  in Vegas hands down to chef ? Ed"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE...I REPEAT. DO NOT EAT HERE. SERVICE IS TERRIBLE! We walked in on a Saturday afternoon (party of 3) thinking it wasn't going to be busy since it was around 3:00 pm. We were not greeted by the 2 servers who were standing at the counter busily staring at their cash register like they had no idea what they were doing. After 5 minutes of standing around, we were finally asked how many was in our party. That same server left in which we thought she was going to get our table ready but in actuality, she disappeared. So again, after 5 mins we were asked if we have been helped. This server decides to take us to a table and then proceeds asking us what we would like to drink. She then leaves us at our table while we were under the assumption she was getting our water. NOPE! We waited for a good 10-15 mins and decided to get up and leave. Most horrible experience waiting around especially since we were starving. Never going back there ever again! We decided to go to Goyemon down the street and we had the best sushi and experience off the strip ever! So go to Goyemon instead of this dump of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"I am spoiled as I have sushi from the west coast as a comparative.    So it's with that I begin this review.  The good. Traditional decor. Cosy restaurant.  Friendly staff. Japanese speaking sushi chefs.  Nice cold Japanese beer.  Great gallery of famous sports autographs.  You can tell I am grasping.  Miso soup not bad.  Price. Reasonable. I always compare my sushi prices. By miso soup and a California roll. This place $2 and $6. So for TO. Reasonable.  The bad.  Gyoza. Deep fried. Likely frozen. Wrong sauce (they used teriyaki!? ) Rainbow Roll. Well constructed. But. And it's a big one. Fish was not good. I did not finish.  This was a $13 roll it was generous but fish needs to be fresh.   I won't return is the bottom line. Unless I want a Cali roll and cold beer. (Generally safer option.)"}
{"text":"Love this place!!aAll you can eat sushi and everything on the menu so delicious. Great pricing too"}
{"text":"Considering just the food, I have to say that it's really great here. Really quality sushi here. The All You Can Eat menu also includes other dishes besides sushi, such as Calamari or Asian Skirt Steak. The food here is pretty darn great.  However.... the service here is horrible. I've been here about 6 times and it's a bad experience most of the time. I wait for up to 30 minutes for my food. One time my server forgot to put in anything that I ordered so I didn't get my food for a whole 45 minutes.  I also had to wait to be seated for 20 minutes when I could clearly see that there were about a dozen free tables.  Also, one time I went there and the server recognized me from a week before. She remembered that I didn't tip so generously the last time I was there, so when we sat down, she told us \"I hope you tip more this time\". I believe that was extremely rude. It ruined my appetite for the rest of the meal."}
{"text":"Fast service and good food, this is currently my go to Sushi place. They have a wide variety of rolls and will adjust the food in each roll as needed. I have only done the all you can eat option but with all the rolls and sashimi choices it is the best way to go."}
{"text":"Friend brought me here after a long wait for luggage at airport..and with the all you can eat menu hit the spot ....  nice service .."}
{"text":"We have been to this location several times and it has been several different Sushi places. I really enjoyed the Nuclear Bomb roll the most. All of the rolls we tried were decent. Really good place to do all you can eat. We did have trouble three times of them trying to bring us the wrong roll."}
{"text":"Our good friends favorite place, half way across town and the service is horrible. ......."}
{"text":"Good little sushi spot if you live in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Best sushi place so far for AYCE! Service is fast and fish isn't dry like at sushi kaya. We went on a busy day too and the waiters and waitresses were constantly quick with delivering our dishes and putting in orders."}
{"text":"Food is always good. But the service has been very slow lately. Its the second time we came and it took 20-25 min for the food to come. They are usually consistent with the fast service. We decided to order just one more roll and that took almost half hour. At one point we were going to cancel the order but they eventually bought the food. I dont know if the chefs are short? But it wasnt busy at all. But we will try again since it is my favorite sushi place... The service has just been tremendously slow lately."}
{"text":"The Best Oyshi spot is the one on Rainbow! I mean the atmosphere and service is nice. However, I gave this place a couple of tries since this one is close to my house BUT I rather travel to go to the one on Rainbow. The sushi is not as great here as the other. I guess maybe the cooks are different? The taste is not the same. For example, the Spicy Tuna Crunch tasted terrible. I actually tasted the fish. The one at Rainbow tastes good and spicy!"}
{"text":"The absolute best all you can eat sushi restaurant I have ever been to!!   I'm from Los Angeles but came here with my friends when we visited Vegas.  Loved it so much, that we went back the next trip after that.   They are definitely not stingy with their sushi portions and you get a lot of bang for your buck.  It's about $25 and you for sure get your money's worth at Oyshi!  Not only are the sushi AYCE but the appetizers as well!  At the end of the meal, you get a free dessert too!  I had the creme brulee which was delicious! :) It would be my pleasure to come back here again!"}
{"text":"Came in here for the first time on a Sunday 2pm, off peak lunch hour. There were about 4 other groups eating there with 5 sushi chefs working. Our initial order took quite a while - it did not all come out at once which is understandable, but I've definitely eaten at other places that don't have as many chefs that was much faster.   Anyway, the first round was all nigiri - the first half came out great! Fish was fresh, rice portions under them were very reasonable. When the second half of the nigiri order came out.. The ENTIRE PLATE was drowned in ponzu sauce.. Gross. This is a big no-no, the rice was so drenched in this sauce that it couldn't even be picked up without the rice falling apart. For this I am docking a star.  I then decided to order some of their appetizer fresh oysters (to wash the disgusting ponzu sauce out of my mouth). They came out promptly and we're definitely fresh. They came out with a little bit of a pico de gallo type salsa on them and already had hot sauce on it.  The oysters were very clean and shucked properly - an observation I did have was that the oyster itself was almost tasteless - as in, no Oceany taste - perhaps they were farmed oysters if that's a thing.  (We paid dinner price to get in on these and the uni/sweet shrimp during lunch hour, definitely worth the extra $5pp if you eat these)  Also tried the lobster fair and spider roll - the spider roll was kind of bland and the lobster fair was a California roll with crab salad burnt on top - I would not order either one of those again.   The wife got green tea tiramisu and green tea creme brûlée. I sampled both and they were quite delicious.  Service was ok, our waitress must have ended her shift while we were half way through eating but the other servers were all willing to help.  In summary, not a bad AYCE sushi joint - but make sure you tell them to hold that ponzu sauce if it's not your thing.  Also choose your rolls carefully if you order any - I won't order rolls from there anymore but would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"I usually come here if I don't feel like waiting at goyemon. Their sushi is not as fresh here but I do love their sides and baked rolls. Agedashi tofu, grilled beef asparagus, and their skirt steak are some of my favorite sides. I like their Oyshi roll, love affair, and volcano roll (ask for them to make it with the garlic yum yum). It's a cute place and usually not much of a wait. And they have great desserts. The parfait and creme brûlée are very good. Although their parfait seems to be smaller in size lately."}
{"text":"So far I've been here twice. Definitely a place I would recommend. Amazing customer service. They have tons of selection for there all you can eat. What I also like is that there quick on serving you what you order which is a plus!"}
{"text":"Just ok. Definitely not the best sushi I've ever eaten and I hope that Toronto has better. I was visiting the city and had lunch there. Maki was quite dry, like it had been sitting overnight, sushi was bland. Staff was pushy and the place is cramped. I would not go back."}
{"text":"The best sushi place in Vegas, and it's all-you-can eat.  It's been theorized by our mother that my brother and I have tapeworms with the amount of food we devour on a daily basis. With the amount of sushi we ate tonight, this could be true. Lunch is cheaper at $21 per person but I'm sure there are less things to order. We came for the all-you-can eat dinner ($26 per person) and ordered:  - yellowtail - salmon - tuna - mackerel - uni (sea urchin) - oysters (limit 4 per person) - red rock roll - dynamite roll - favorite roll - and like, six other rolls.  The bottom line is that all the fish is fresh, the service is prompt and friendly, but the food can take a while to come out when they're busy (especially since it's an all you can eat place and there's a ton of things to make) so after your first order comes, order again immediately before you finish to insure it gets there on time.   There is a 2 hour limit for the all you can eat option but I didn't have any issues with it. Most sushi places have this rule as a safety cushion for those rude customers who don't know any better and camp out in the restaurant for hours as if it were their last meal.  The decor is industrial Asian with exposed pipes, bricks, dim lighting, and colorful murals. It's a snazzy place in an unassuming location, but I'd totally take a date here.  With tip and tax, it came out to around $65 for two and that's including drinks and after devouring half the Pacific Ocean. We will be back with the whole family."}
{"text":"As a AYCE sushi veteran, I can honestly say that this is one of the best I've ever had. Food and service, top notch!"}
{"text":"I'm going to be in the minority here and state I do not like this place. They have a vast selection of rolls, which is great for that type of sushi lover...I prefer a wider variety of nigiri sushi and other items.  Our most recent visit here was a group of 8 and it was terrible. Our server was slow in taking our orders, and also kept messing up. Our orders were either incorrect in terms of quantity and selection, or they didn't arrive at all. The quality of the sushi was average. They didn't have enough teapots (we ordered hot green tea) so we had to WAIT for one to become available. Really.  They added on the automatic group tip that is typical with parties of 8+. What was suprising was that it was for 20% of the bill. We were so anxious to be done with that place, we didn't even bother bringing it up. And just to put things in perspective, our bill listed we ordered 12 items for a group of 8.  So that should tell you we were in no way high maintenance. I cannot stress how terrible the service was. This should not be acceptable, especially in a town that has a ton of sushi restaurants.  I would never go back here again, especially in a large group situation. So disappointing."}
{"text":"My go-to for sushi! I've tried countless other sushi restaurants of similar caliber, waiting for one to surpass this place and after years, still haven't found one. They have so many delicious rolls to choose from and don't over-do it with certain components like some other restaurants have. Quality is consistent time after time and great service. Thanks Oyshi!"}
{"text":"Wow excellent food and service.  First time there but won't be my last.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food is normally good but last night I waited over 20 minutes for one roll. All my stuff came out before my girlfriends. It was ridiculous also the server didn't speak that great of English. It was extremely hard to understand her and she had an attitude whenever we ordered something. I don't understand how a place can have prices that high and not have good service. It's completely unacceptable. I expect to be contacted by management with this review. I'm not impressed and I'm not happy with the service. On a side note they were playing rap and music that should not be played in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Update: although I initially was turned off by the discrepancy of the hours listed for yelp and the seating hours of the restaurant itself, I have to say this is my goto sushi spot in town for AYCE"}
{"text":"Thanks Neal V-G for recommending this place!! Great place to eat before a bachelor party.  5 Star rating for sure, here's why: Came here after a 3 hour trip from Los Angeles. Arrived around 4pm, with a group of 12. Was seated promptly in the back private room. Drinks were served quickly, left us with a large jug of ice water= awesome. Waiter was very polite and patient with our large group of guys. We all ordered different rolls and shared them. Each roll was delicious. Presentation, taste and size of content to each roll was perfect. I remember getting the Rattle snake, Heart attack, Lobster fare,  shrimp tempura, miso soup, fried scallops, warm saki and calamari. Absolutely no complaints of any item ordered.  Best, made to eat, all you can eat eat (AYCE) sushi joint ever.   Caution: Do not over order!! Take your time and enjoy each item is my advice. After your first roll you will want to go berzerk and order everything on the menu, trust me just enjoy and order what you can finish. You may feel pressured by the two hour time limit, but don't worry you will have plenty of time and the food is served pretty quickly."}
{"text":"I pretty much had a good time the two times I went here. My favorite are their salmon dishes. Anything on their menu with salmon in it is a definite favorite. I don't know why we can only order ONE dessert out of the AYCE menu though...  The only thing that bothered me was the service. It was the slowest I've ever had, ever. (And I've been to a lot of places, not just in Vegas). If they fix their slow service, this place could definitely become my favorite place for AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Overall score of one star. This review may be long but I wanted to be sure that these one-offs were not left unnoticed.   My family and I came here for dinner on Christmas Day. We called ahead and were told there was no wait. On arrival the wait was 20 minutes. Forgivingly, we decided to sit at the bar to kill time.   Low and behold: they did not have a bartender. Not only was this made noted to us, but we were told by a server  that drinks would have to be ordered when we sat down; completely fine, they seemed busy.  So we were seated in one of their private rooms. We sat  down and the menus were not spread amongst the table and placed for us to distribute amongst ourselves. In retrospect, it was a small complaint compared to the 30 total minutes we waited for our beers. Which, on delivery, the server mentioned he would be back for our order  after he brought the 22oz Sapporo bottle he forgot.  So upon his delayed return and 10 additional minutes for this bottle of beer, he attempted to again avoid taking our order. I quickly asked if we could order starters, in which he responded quickly: IF we were ready he could actually take our whole order.   We started to fire off items for our party. At this point we were just happy to be ordering. Things appeared slowly but we had to ask for the ginger and wasabi for the table after about three nigiri plates were served. It's traditional that AYCE sushi establishments either bring this with the first plate or serve it immediately after the first order is placed; this was not the case.   It was a slope from here. We had to ask a runner every time we had something missing from the table. The server wouldn't observe or offer the entire party if they needed anything else, for example: refills on beers. (Which, in my experience as a server, is key to making a great tips!) and to top it all off we were service charged as a party of 7, although their menu explicitly states 8. Luckily, it was 18% and by the end of our meal, we opted to save ourselves more time by letting it go.  They probably knew we would not be back, as on our way out the server's attempt to allay any concern was that \"(he) would redeem himself the next time.\"  That phrase in itself made me write this review. Not only did you subliminally acknowledge the subpar service you provided but you were unwilling to listen and communicate with your diners, whilst imposing a service charge that was unwarranted. This is not only a poor reflection of service standards but the unimportance the staff perceives with poor guest experiences.  I don't recommend visiting this establishment to anyone looking for anticipatory service."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great service. Hostess accidentally gave our reservation away but when we pointed it out she apologized profusely and got us sat quickly. It's a great environment and great food. We have been coming here for many years and we will continue."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a party of three on a Sunday night in April. We were seated promptly and our drink order was taken soon after. We all had AYCE and it was delicious. I had the Red Rock Signature Roll, Snow Mountain Signature Roll and Salmon Lovers Roll. They were all delicious. I would also recommend having a refreshing Berry Parfait with Green Tea Ice Cream!"}
{"text":"Food quality was tasty, but the rolls have too many layers of rice! Service was disappointing, the waiter delivered my drink holding the rim of my cup - gross! The menu didn't have the correct pricing, so I was over charged, when I got my bill, I questioned it and I was challenged - I pointed out their error was told \"it's already in the system, I can't change it\" - Bad customer service."}
{"text":"Went halves with a friend. Rib eye steak teriyaki was alright, but the gyudon was really good. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Fish is so so. Had 5 different kinds. They all taste the same.  Im a pro at eating sashimi having been to Japan numerous time.  This place is fine for an American palette."}
{"text":"This place is A-OK indeed. The all-you-can eat is very enticing the first 3 times you have it but after that, I can't even imagine putting myself through that again. All-you-can eat on the menu except sashimi means you will stuffing yourself with rice at the end of the night which is not very enjoyable.  The best  deal is the kid's Ninja Meal which is what I want to eat every time I go here but I can't...They're very strict on it. I brought my nephew here last time and he was sleeping so I thought I could order this Ninja meal and take it to go for him. Well NO! \"Kid's sleeping can't do it. Only when he wakes up.\"   Bottom line. Obviously I'd eat here. But I'm not proud of it. I feel like I'm in a bad relationship where my girlfriend is abusive and I still take it. Thank god there's plenty of fishes in the sea..."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch yesterday. Restaurant is really small so we had to wait about 20 minutes for seats. We ended up sitting at the sushi bar. The menu was simple, consisting a mix of sushi, typical japanese entrees (eg. Terayaki chicken), these \"domes\" which look like dons to me and udons.   We ordered two lunch sushi specials. They came with miso soup and salad, both of which were standard ayce level quality. The sushi came and although a really large portion for the price, the quality was quite disappointing. The tempura inside my dynamite roll wasn't even crunchy anymore. From a sushi perspective, this place was probably on par with some of the cheaper ayce places (which aren't good if you don't get where I'm coming from).   The restaurant does well for itself being located south of front where there are limited choices. I wouldn't visit again but if you are in the area and crave sushi, maybe you could give it shot."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice. Umbrella lights were my wife's favorite part aside from the tree rooms. Sushi is good. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"They say the gems are found outside the strip and this is def a Gem for the locals. All you can eat fresh suchi and menu..... Oh man. Delicious"}
{"text":"We went to celebrate my wife's birthday with friends and family and reserved the VIP room. We have been there before and thought the food was good and wanted to go back. I do not usually post reviews but this was by far the worst experience I had to say something. From the start our server was not very forth coming. Just him asking for our drinks was a bother to him. He could not even get through the entire table of 10 before he had to excuse himself and said he will be right back. We all looked at each other like wtf just happened?? Then when he finally took all of our drink orders he ended up forgetting one and it took forever to get him to bring that drink.   We figured we better get our order in right away since we were already afraid of what was to come. So our food started coming out and the runners that were delivering the food literally had no idea what each roll was. They came to the table and had the list of what was on their tray but didn't know which was which. So they just basically put the food on the ends of our table for us to figure out what each roll was for ourselves. This happened with each person that brought anything out to our table. It ended up A couple of us didn't even receive all of our rolls and we received a couple extra rolls that didn't even order.   This was about an hour into us being there and do you think we have received any refills on our drinks by now? One of our friends actually went to the bar and asked for a pitcher of water. Literally baffled at this point.   Needless to say at the end of the evening we asked to speak to a manager and the lady that was walking by at the moment that actually paid attention to us claimed to be the manager. We told her our concerns of the service and lack there of and how they did not know any of the food they were serving. She seemed like she had heard it before but was not willing to compensate us for our troubles. Only to offer us more dessert. No thank you.   DO NOT SIT IN THE BACK ROOM AS THEY WILL FORGET YOU ARE THERE! But also please train your people on the food you serve.   10 people that will never eat at this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place. Not for the sushi.  The sushi is fresh but not super creative. I love that the all you can eat includes the appetizers which I love! The shrimp yakitori and sizzling plates keep me coming back! The service is amazing also. Jane may be the best server I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great sushi...All u can eat... Redrock, tigerroll, popcorn scallops and Japanese ribeye awesome!!!"}
{"text":"My orchestra member and I came here last minute looking for a new sushi restaurant and found Oyshi. The place was slow due to the day of the week I suppose but the staff was wonderful. I recently started eating sushi so struggled what to order and Nacho, Pertro, Andy, and Roberto were more than accommodating to helping me with my decisions. My waitress Kim was quite assertive and checked in often to make sure we were pleased. Here perky personality made me smile.  Tanya was not our waitress but still checked in on us. It isn't often you find a place that the staff is friendly and keeps you laughing your entire stay. Found my new sushi addiction!! Must also add the staff is very easy on the eyes...... Did not know how to use Yelp so I used my friends account, Becky"}
{"text":"Very good neighborhood sushi spot. I got the AYCE. Customer service was friendly. I will come back again and ag"}
{"text":"So me and my friend wanted to do sushi for lunch. We were headed to our normal place, got there and it was closed for lunch on Sunday. Such a disappointment! We then drove a few blocks down to Oyshi Sushi. The place was very beautiful and open. Great service and sushi bar. I wasn't feeling to good on this day so I didn't get to eat as much as I wanted but I had a lobster roll that was out of this world! I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. We didn't have the best service. They did run out of the plum wine which is my favorite but she did have recommendations for other types drinks. We ordered entree and several rolls everything tasted great."}
{"text":"Been going here for over a year now, after hearing that it was the LVRJ's editor's choice for Best of Las Vegas. Proximity to home was a big plus, of course!  It will likely remain my favorite, but I was incredibly embarrassed last night when bringing friends from the UK there for dinner after talking the place up so much. The service was WAY off, although the food was still excellent. They recently opened a new location on Sahara, so I'm hoping that this was just a matter of a bunch of trainees not knowing what they were doing (everyone looked new and got orders wrong, not providing place settings until after food was already served, not knowing which tables ordered what food, etc.).  Here's hoping that's all it was. I still suggest everyone give them a chance, as the actual food will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Love their sushi lunch special, miso soup, and house salad! Great service and prices too."}
{"text":"Iv'e been here several times and have brought plenty of friends and family here. Sometimes it gets a little busy but that's why you can make a reservation! Favorite sushi place by far. I live in North LV and will make the drive. The lobster affair roll is my ultimate favorite along with everyone else's. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Oyshi Sushi as it took my sushi virginity! I wish the prices dropped to be more comparable to other sushi spots in the area but all one can do is hope. AYCE is the safest bet for a dinner out with a table for two or more. You ensure no one will need to wash dishes in the back if they get carried away with indulging. We all have those dinner friends who have the mindset of caviar budgets but the reality of dollar-value-menu wallets.   Service is usually a hit or miss. I've gotten service that has made me not want to leave. On the other hand I've experienced servers at this establishment that made me want to request take-out. (which they do offer).   The draw back for this place is they don't do half orders like other spots. It's also nowhere near the strip. Which is a catch-22. The wait can be timely depending on the day of the week. If it were closer to the strip it would be an endless wait.  Mussels, Love Affair, Lobster Fair, Oyshi Roll, and the Japanese Lasagna are my favorites!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here I know that they have other location. I loved it here I will be coming back for my birthday because they have amazing private room it was worth the experience and the sushi was great ! Customer service was excellent ."}
{"text":"My daughter got very ill within 30 minutes of eating sushi. Started to vomit within an hour. Is the fish fresh? Then the lights went off in the restaurant and they didn't charge for the meal. Hmmm. Not happy and need a trip to ER from her vomiting over 5 times."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding. Most of the time the service is good. Went one day after class and had to wait one hour for our food, but the quality of the sushi made up for it. Always go for the love affair roll. If you're going to get more than three rolls and you have a big stomach you might as well go for the all you can eat."}
{"text":"Oyshi was my favorite sushi location and having another location was such a great news for me! However, my experience at the Sahara location is so bad I was impelled to write this review! Tho the ambiance was nicer than the rainbow location, the customer service here is HORRIBLE! They are so slow! To make it much worse the male manager gives you a rude vibe. Boy, he needs some serious customer service training. I was gonna just ignore it thinking he might just be having a bad day, but the next few times our family came back he couldn't be more ruder(if there's such a word)   Anyway, I promised myself  I will never set foot in that location again! I love Oyshi so I will be loyal to the rainbow location only!   They just lost my business!"}
{"text":"Spending Christmas Eve at Oyshi enjoy the amazing sushi and holiday spirit. This restaurant is always unmatched."}
{"text":"The only AYCE sushi I've tried in Vegas but the best AYCE sushi place I've ever been to ($22 for lunch). What I love about this place is the menu isn't limited to a certain AYCE menu. You can order anything off the menu with the exception of sashimi but that's about it. You can tell the seafood is super fresh/prepared perfectly. You can have one dessert per person per AYCE so we tried the green tea berry parfait & the green tea creme brûlée. Absolute heaven.   Service was on point with no complaints at all.   Every item we tried was delicious & we will definitely be back M-F between 3:30 - 5:30pm for 20% off AYCE Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"I find myself at this location often because of its proximity to my office. It's a pretty decent place. I adore the friendly staff here and the ambiance. It's definitely a nice location. The fish to rice ratio is decent but not great. They tend to be a hit or miss location. I've had days where it was all on point and I've eaten till I was gonna burst because everything was perfect. Then I've had days where the rice has been purely terrible. Just hard and tasting like it's been left out for awhile. Because of this inconsistency in terms of their food quality is why I would only give them 3 stars. Great happy hour specials however. The sake deals are on point. They have the space for large groups but still the consistency is their weak spot."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI BUFFET EVER.  BEST SUSHI BUFFET EVER.  B_E_S_T  S_U_S_H_I B_U_F_F_E_T E_V_E_R!!!!!!  Okay, if this obnoxious review cannot convince you to try it out, then perhaps all the other positive ones will!   Thanks to Yelp!, my friends took us here several months ago and the eight of us who went loved it! It seriously beat all the sushi-buffets I have ever been to. The sushi buffet menu is comprehensive! Every type of roll you can think of, Maki sushi, miso-soup, wakame salad(!!!), etc. etc. It even features menu items that even non-sushi lovers would enjoy -- tons of appetizers, surf and turf steak and shrimp, terayiki, tempura, etc. It comes with free tea, and a free dessert after your meal. And it's less expensive than a Vegas buffet!   Totally worth it!! I went again a second time and introduced it to a new group and it did not disappoint.   The only gripe I have is they have a rule that you have to eat most of the rice or there will be a surcharge. Only a slight bummer, but I cannot blame them. It is still a very fabulous place worth spending the $$$ you earned gambling!!!"}
{"text":"I ate there on 4th of July and got food poisoning. I felt it was weird since the fish wasn't really cold. But now I'm spending my 4th of July on the toliet. I'm never coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I really like this place. $26.00 all you can eat sushi and hot entrées for dinner...and not cafeteria style where everything is already made for the taking...the food is made to order. It annoyed me that the seemingly easy to make sushi, nigiri, took the longest to be served. The rolls came like clockwork but I had to remind the waitress several times that my sake, hamachi and unagi nigiri hadn't come yet. By the way the unagi was cold and didn't taste fresh.  Living in the Bay Area, this place was a pleasant surprise in terms of quality and price. I will try again before heading back...perhaps a second chance at 4 stars. I'm assuming that there are 5 star sushi places in Vegas, but I would probably pay double the price for less food."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Kenny was the best! Very knowledge of the food made amazing recommendation! We will definitely be returning on a regular basis with service like Kenny! Thanks for the dope time!"}
{"text":"It's all good, really....Me and my lady went on a Friday and had to wait 20-30mins but it was worth the wait. Got the all-you-can-eat YES!!! and everything I ordered was good.  Great place for a date...Cool music too."}
{"text":"Quick service! Best AYCE in town hands down The spicy tuna crunch roll, so crunchy, so spicy, so yummie. I would put that in my mouth every day.  Also the green tea crème brûleè is orgasmic. Gotta have that."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome!! From the atmosphere and decor to the service down to the variety of rolls, their Ayce is awesome!! I mean everything was awesome! This was my was my second time coming here and my experience was even better than the first! If u have been to a few AYCE sushi places around town you are either in a tight spot nearly in the couples  next to u convo, nearly touching elbows  or they are rushing u to hurry and turn the tables.. Not here!! I didn't feel rushed, my server gave great suggestion on things to try!! I left very satisfied and FULL! My new #1 sushi place!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday. IT WAS AWSOME!!! Food: 5 stars! I used to not like sushi. But I decided to give it another try, see if I'll change my mind. After our visit, I discovered MY NEWFOUND LOVE!! Sushi!!!  Price: 5 stars! Prices were reasonable. We went for their all-you-can-eat that costed about $26/person. I must say, we ate so much I think the store will go bankrupt! Jk.   Service: 5 stars!  Our server was also very nice. He always checked in on us to see if we're doing good. Very polite and quick. It seems like all of the servers there were.  Worth the time and money. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite AYCE Sushi in Las Vegas. The quality of fish and the execution is excellent and always consistent. I go there for the Hamachi and fresh Scallop Nigiri and the Nuclear Bomb specialty roll. This is a great place for small or large groups, business or casual. This place is great for lunch, but dinner is where they shine. Check out the items exclusive to dinner only, all are excellent!"}
{"text":"This place was a gem to find especially on Christmas Day! Andre our server was exceptional. He offered dishes of items I was craving which were crab and scallops. He did not disappoint as I ate everrrrrything.   Our waters never dipped below half and it came with lemons without asking. Desert was delish. I chose the creme brule which came with the $22 lunch menu.   Leave a review and receive a free beer on draft. Awesome ambiance, awesome service!!"}
{"text":"First time here at Oyshi's on Sahara Blvd. thanks to a recommendation from my chiropractor.  I like the setup and the look of the place, feels comfortable, and love the menu.  I had the all you can eat sushi with loads to pick from and they also have the non-sushi menu, pretty awesome!  I don't usually see a separate area with a bar in a sushi restaurant but it's here alright! and the cocktails options look great...I will definitely try it next time ;) not today to early for that :/ hey!! don't judge it's noon/ lunch time & on a Monday ;)  A 4 star due to the flavor of the sushi, it wasn't a super wow...ur typical Vegas sushi. Nothing compares to Cali sushi:(  Service was great, cool chick w/ great eyebrows ; ) very helpful and great suggestions.  Love the in house made Creme Brûlée!  A must.   I'll be back, perhaps I'll order something different and hopefully it will wow me to a 5 star  : * Will definitely recommend it to Fam. And Friends."}
{"text":"One of my favorite all you can eat sushi spots in Vegas! I've only dined at the sushi bar. Chefs are amazing and will remember exactly what you order after you've gone a few times.  A++++"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to come over to Oyshi for a bite to eat while our car was being serviced across the street. We sat at the sushi bar and we were happily surprised to see a sushi chef we knew from another spot, years back....... so, he knew what we were looking for, we are not the typical AYCE customers...... I prefer quality to quantity!!!!! The Mu sake is one of our favorites. The perfect compliment to good sushi! So that set us off to the perfect start! I will say that if you are into the AYCE sushi.... this is probably a great spot for you, they have a huge selection of rolls, sushi, appetizers, and I was pretty impressed when I saw the final bill.  Me personally, I appreciated the selection of fresh fish and the chef guided us in the right direction every step of the way."}
{"text":"We love Oyshi! Originally familiar with the Southwest location, we decided to finally try the new location and as always we weren't disappointed.   We only go to AYCE - for dinner here it's $27 which honestly if you \"shop around\" you'll find is pretty much the same everywhere - if it's cheaper it's probably not a quality place lol   Service and food were great. Just a tip, Red Rock roll, Lobster fair and their Ribeye sizzling plates are to die for. If you're a crem brûlée fan - they have chocolate edition :) the new location is slightly larger than southwest and the decor looks great! We'll be back for our next date night."}
{"text":"I almost wrote this place off for the unusual amount of time I spent waiting to be seated but patience paid off.  I ordered the AYCE (All You Can Eat) lunch & had an egg roll, a spicy tuna crunch roll & a rainbow roll.  I informed my server of my food sensitivities & she assured me that I can make omissions :-) (some sushi places are funny about that)  My eggroll was ok, nothing special, but I have to say that both my sushi rolls were very tasty & fresh.  Although not totally family friendly, its a relaxed enough atmosphere that you could totally bring the kiddos.  The bathroom although small was neat & clean.  My one note is in regards to service.  The staff wasn't especially friendly nor were they cold.  A smile here or there definitely would earn another star.  That being said, a must for sushi lovers especially with the wide variety of choices on the AYCE menu.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Ask for Chef Ed!  He's the best!  He'll make the best off-menu treats if you ask him, but make sure to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"I like this place for their salmon dons, a dome of sushi rice covered by many pieces of salmon, cut in varying thickness, but not too thick. They also offer a tuna don and spicy versions of both.  Their chicken cutlet is fantastic! After several visits, we have yet to tire of it (great every time!) It is also available in the \"ebi\" fry, which is a variety of 3 fried items, including shrimp.  I enjoy the miso soup, which as far as I can tell, has an added element of a sumashi broth, making it more delicious and complex in flavour (very tasty!)  They often give freebies, such as edamame or fried chicken with sweet sauce, which is always appreciated.  The enclosed areas are nice for privacy and the service ranges from efficient to slightly overwhelmed, but still cordial.  Unfortunately, parking is an issue in the area, especially after 7pm. 3.5 stars... more than A-ok, but inconvenient if you're not already in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome service with Kevin at the bar. Great all you can eat whole menu! Bar. Sushi. Sushi bar. Won't go anywhere else. Family friendly. Food is perfection."}
{"text":"Experience:  a friend invited me to lunch, and this was the spot he picked. We met one other friend who mentioned their is another location she had frequented.   Facility: The restaurant was very nice with lots of unique accents and modern decor. They had both chair and tables and half booths with chairs too. The bar is pretty small and seats around 8-10.   Service:  It was very slow when we arrived, and it seems when restaurants are really slow, they tend to forget to check on their guests. They were friendly and helped when you asked, but I felt I had to flag them down too many times from their little congregation at the hostess booth. I'd give the service a 3 star rating.    Food:  the food was good. The $22 AYCE lunch does not include the sashimi, so that was a disappointment. They also don't serve oysters, uni or sweet shrimp for lunch. We ordered calamari, veggie tempura, spicy tuna roll, gyoza, seaweed salad, mussels, Cali salmon roll, snow mountain, a few other rolls they ordered I don't remember.  A special shout out to the dynamite, which actually had a teriyaki flavor, the Tempura shrimp, the atomic bomb roll, and this fabulous cucumber salad called sumomono, which was a nice palate cleanser.   Overall:  this was a pretty good lunch. Not my fav AYCE sushi place, but nice enough where I would come back with friends again."}
{"text":"I'm not from Vegas but today marks my 3rd time coming here and I look forward to making it a tradition each time i'm in town. This place is awesome. It's a bit of a drive off the strip, about 10 minutes but well worth it. It has a nice ambiance perfect for a date or a night out with the girls. There were quite a bit of families there also. 26 dollars ! All you can eat. I've been to many AYCE sushi places and they always give you fewer choices and just the basic appetizers and maybe a green tea ice cream for dessert. Not this place. They have a huge selection of rolls. They are so delicious. Ummm. They have so many appetizers to choose from. If your a meat eater you will appreciate it because they offer a lot of meat dishes. Last but not least if you have room the dessert is heavenly. They have creme brulee, green tea tiramisu, berry parfaits and one other that I cannot recall.  All this for 26 bucks. It's unbelievable that you can get all this and still have great quality. The only negative thing I can say about this place is that on Friday and Saturday nights it gets busy so you may have to wait a while for them to come back and get your 2nd orders. This still doesn't deter me from giving them 5 stars because the servers are really helpful and cordial when they do come back."}
{"text":"We come here when we want all you can eat sushi. I love that they have so many different rolls to choose from. Everything tastes delicious every time. My 5 year old loves them too!  The service on the other hand is a hit or miss. The last time we went in it wasn't very busy, but we had to wait forever for our food! It was like they were out catching the fish as we were waiting for it."}
{"text":"So what makes a great sushi restaurant?  Great Service, Nice entertaining sushi chefs and most of all yummy fresh cut fish!  Sadly Oyshi had NONE of these qualities.  First of all the hostess Kassidy was the rudest restaurant host I have ever encountered. We got there at 5:45 pm on Tuesday.  There were 12 open seats at the bar and many open tables.  She said there was a wait because there were not enough servers for any more guests and the next server comes at 6pm.  So we said we would wait till 6.  At the appointed time, she escorted us to the very end of the bar where there was no visibility of the fish cases or the chefs and there were 10 empty prime seats in the center of the bar.  Really?  When we questioned her, she rudely said, \"I don't make the rules, the bar for servers is split in 2\"   So the rules are  give the first guests to arrive for the evening the worst possible seat????  She reluctantly moved us and stomped away in a huff.  The server was only slightly more friendly.  Oh and guess what, you can't speak to the chefs.  You have to order through the server who only comes around rarely.  We decided to order a la cart instead of all you can eat because we prefer cut fish.     Unfortunately the albacore fish was gross and mealy and we had to send it back.  My poor husband ate a couple of pieces of it and paid the price this morning.  The other fish plates were cut thick and not refined.  Most of the fish is pre-cut in the case making it dry out.  I ordered a grilled hamachi kamma, (cheek) and was told it would take 20 minutes.  Well no wonder it came out overcooked and dry because it probably only needs to broil 5 minutes.  They also covered it in masago eggs which i hate and I had ask to have them removed.  The rolls had the TINIEST cut piece of fish I've ever gotten in a roll.   I asked for seared tuna nigiri and got the wrong order.   I also ordered eel nigiri and it was grilled eel but COLD,  so they also grill that ahead of time and serve it cold,  YUCK.  Its the fresh warm juicy eel that makes it good.  The \"rice\" under the nigiri was I'm not sure what.  It was not whole kernels of rice but some kind of rice paste.  I could not find one kernel of rice in it.  It tasted fishy and gross like rice pulp, elmers glue and fish water mushed up.  It was not edible.    At the end of our meal, the waiting area was full but there were 6 empty tables.  The hostess takes great pride in her little power of NOT SEATING guests.  I wanted to tell them RUN!  and save your money and your tummy.  Her bad attitude definitely sets off the experience to be bad. I have no idea how this place is popular when the only decent thing we ate was the edamame.    We only went here because our favorite place had no seating from being so full on a tuesday night at 5:30 pm.  Next time we will make reservations at our normal place and spare ourselves from this bad treatment and bad food.    I see other recent bad reviews so take note people...."}
{"text":"Walking in, the decor is chic and modern.  The music is hip lounge style music - and I swear someone has stolen my Upbeat station on Pandora.  The staff is young, friendly, and fast paced.     The food comes two ways - ALL YOU CAN EAT or ala carte. I opted for the more modest ala option as I am flying solo.  The food tastes fresh, the presentation lovely, and the delivery onto the plate quite speedy.  My only complaint about the food was that the rolls are packed very tightly...loose rolls aren't awesome.  I can understand how an AYCE would require trading speed for firmness but would rather have the firmness especially via ala carte ordering.   All in all it was a pleasant experience and I will likely return. Four out of five stars for what it is."}
{"text":"I've ate here a few times... We just stopped in here for my moms birthday and this was honestly the worst sushi experience I've ever had.   First off I called and was told that I couldn't make a reservation that it would be slow enough to walk in, we came into a busy restaurant and was told it would take 30 min to be seated. We love to eat sushi and loved this place but the service was Awful! I dont know if the server forgot our Order  or if the kitchen just didn't get the order. Whatever the case may be the manager handled it poorly, There was 6 of us and 5 got AYCE. After being poorly served we got charged for everything which we thought was crazy..... All in all I will never come back to this place, I loved coming here If I was able to give 0 stars I would"}
{"text":"Adding on to Cara N.'s review.  That server was awful, he really spoiled our nice sushi dinner.  Very unprofessional yelling in the restaurant and kitchen, swearing and he has the nerve to apologize for getting loud because it was a long day for him, no excuse!  He then tries to make conversation, but we were done! I'm very surprised none of the other workers stepped in to quiet him down.  Some of the other workers laughed at his antics but I could tell they were embarrassed."}
{"text":"I have gotten sushi from here in the past and it's been pretty good at reasonable prices. Recently went there again and was extremely disappointed with my order. I ordered off the Sushi menu which i have done before. My total came to $8.65 which seemed reasonable for two basic sushi rolls (salmon and spicy tuna)  What I received was literally 4 bites (see photo) So disappointed! Went back in to ask the girl in front if there had been a mix up. She informed me that i ordered off the \"nigiri menu\"  It was the menu she handed me and said sushi on the top -_-  That being said, the two stars are for the salmon \"nigiri\" which was a tasty two bites, and the ponzu sauce  Definitely will not be returning to this place unless they fix the menu and stop overcharging :/"}
{"text":"$27 for all you can eat dinner was too much to pay for my group of 5 and it wasn't worth it. We should've just ordered 1 or 2 items each and it would've been cheaper at the end. Appetizers, salads and the scallops had very small proportions. Rolls were okay, only roll we liked was the Tiger roll. It's not worth coming back, spent too much money plus service was ehh barely checked on us, always had to wave him down."}
{"text":"Gotta love this place. Great Food and Great service and the staff is pro. Its my go to for sushi."}
{"text":"Been here enough times to state that the food is very good, service is great, AYCE is tops and the place has a nice ambiance.  I highly recommend the Tiger roll, spicy tuna roll, poke salad, and the ribeye. Stay away from the cucumber salad. Too much dressing with a weird aftertaste. I think the chef just had a heavy hand that night with the dressing. My friend loves their baked mussels. I'm not a fan of mussels so none for me.  AYE includes a choice of dessert. Their berry parfait with your choice of vanilla or green tea ice cream is devine! They also have mochi and green tea tiramisu. Stay away from that green tea tiramisu...not good at all!! Other than that great place to tame a AYE sushi craving with fantastic hot dishes!"}
{"text":"Great environment and good sushi. Definitely one of the better AYCE sushi restaurant in the Vegas area, however, there are some others with better quality fish.  My only \"complaint?\" They serve a high rice-to-fish ratio to fill you up faster. This is quite common with AYCE places, but there are a few places out there that load the fish and use an appropriate/smaller amount of rice.   Other than that, it is a wonderful place to eat around the Enterprise/Blue Diamond areas!!"}
{"text":"Everything is still about the same..missing food items..long wait times for a place that's not even busy. Food/Service is still hit or miss. Great music. Bussers on point.  Not sure what the problem is,this place can rock harder. Asked for condiments to be eaten with food,server talked for 15 minutes after food came out.  Had to ask for condiments again as good got cold. This place has the potential yet consistently lacks...WHY?? Ambience is there, Food quality is there. Repolish the rest and it could happen."}
{"text":"Just ordered trough Postmates.  Kinda disappointed.  Terrible screaming O sauce and blah rolls.  The Yakitori was super salty and blah as well. Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Great service, great food best describes this place, and you cant beat the all you can eat special. When you're here try the nuclear bomb,  yellow tail sashimi,  and the screaming orgasm. I gotta give a special thanks to Vince for such great service."}
{"text":"sushi was good but the service was bad. we were seated over the sushi bar. the sushiman never asked us what we wanted to get. so we waited for a long time until our waitress came again to order."}
{"text":"Would be 0 stars if I could.. came here for lunch right by my job. Order cali roll lunch special.. never got my soup or salad.. took 25 min for me to get my rolls are you serious for cali rolls.. then says well we have to charge you alacarte because you didn't get the soup salad... wtf I don't have time to wait for the soup salad it's lunch time I have to get back to work.. now your charging me more because you can't bring a soup and salad.. I was late coming back from lunch trying to speak with a manager over them trying to charge me more:.. will never come back here again"}
{"text":"Foods was amazing! They have a lot to offer on the \"appetizers\" section. I'm picky with my rolls and sushi places, but this place has plenty to select from. The Sizzling plates are a must try, especially the sweet & spicy pork. Also desert, chocolate crem brûlée is a fave!  Environment: a modern setting I would say. Music was a bit over taking. Also we sat in a booth and the tables were a bit close to each other, you can hear the whole conversation of the party next to you.  Service: ohhhh the service here is why I gave this place only 3 stars. The service is extra slow even on a easy pace night. Took about 15 min after we sat to just get our waters. Ordered our food and plates were taken off the table when we weren't even done.. I'm sure they could do better.  Other than that, wouldn't mind coming again!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to visit! Best sushi in town for a reasonable price. They have some creative rolls that are worth Atleast one try. My favorite is snow mountain and japanese lasagna! Only complaint is they had amazing music playing old school RnB and hip hop, but now theyve resorted to boring radio music. Kind of ruins the ambiance for me but food is good"}
{"text":"So I have had my fair share in AYCE sushi, and I must say that the combination of the spacious restaurant, GREAT food, and good service this place is definitely one of my favorites. I went there for lunch and spent over 2 hours there and the service did not waiver, and the food was delish! This just became one of my favorite places to go for sushi! Good job OYSHI"}
{"text":"The food was good and the price was right.  We ordered my nephew the Ninja meal which came with a house salad, miso soup, half california roll, teriyaki chicken. For my niece we ordered the Cheesy Katsu meal and that came with a house salad, miso soup, and 3 sauces on the side of katsu sauce, honey mustard, and nacho cheese and a good size of katsu. The kids meals didn't come with rice so we ordered each a bowl on the side. It was alot of food for just the kids, my boyfriend and I ended up eating the left overs and we were stuffed.. it was definetly worth $6 each for the kids meal excluding the bowls of rice.  My boyfriend had the unagi bowl which was perfect as we both shared 1 big bowl of rice unagi and grilled onions which was Delish, an order of a rainbow roll which was ok, as it didn't have avocado :(  but it still took care of my craving for sushi and a salmon handroll which was ok as I've gone to other resturaunts that pack it with salmon and the slices are big.    I like oyshi."}
{"text":"I have tried this place a few times and have always enjoyed it The food i think is pretty good basically like any other place I do like the music they play in the restaurant  But unfortunately i tried to order togo and ordered a few roles and steak dinner when the food arrived I was super disappointed cause i there was no wasabi or ginger  I know that this is pretty minor thing But i dont know how you can forget both those items? Had to leave the house to go get some wasabi ? Which is a real let down cause my dinner was getting cold cause i had to leave the house"}
{"text":"I was back in Vegas for a trade show. We didn't want to wait an hour for Texas De Brazil, so my boss and a guest asked me about \"that sushi place you rave about\" off we went to Oyshi! My boss AND our guest are sushi snobs and all the way there they voiced their concerns. As soon as the appetizers were done and our first rolls served, they were hooked and raved about the great rolls and how they will be back themselves! Thank You Oyshi Sushi for making me a hero!"}
{"text":"I used to work next to this place, I like their staffs, friendly n quick service, food is decently fresh."}
{"text":"Most locals know where to go for sushi! It's the best for carb loading after a long run! Menu is extensive that offers variety of choices for most. My fav are hot stuff like Asian skirt steak! Come for lunch or just come and fill up!"}
{"text":"I love AYCE (all you can eat) places that have a variety of items and not just sushi.  I've been coming to this location for years. Actually my first AYCE experience was here.  I've also taken many friends here to eat who didn't like sushi because their AYCE menu is filled with so many items. It gives people a chance to ease into sushi places if it's not their favorite thing to eat.  Two items that I highly recommend are Lobster fair and Love affair. Just so darn yummy. lobster fair is a California roll with baked lobster yumminess on top. Love affair is a STR with baked crab meat yumminess on top. Both just melt in your mouth.  Also love the different desserts they have. Anything from green tea ice cream to mochi to cream brûlée. Again, so many different options.  Service is not the fastest so be patient. It's AYCE anyway so sit back and enjoy the experience.  Also, don't come during peak dinner hours on Friday and Saturday. Your wait will be long."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection, freshness and service! I sure wish there was a location near the East Coast. I had oysters, Poké plus the sushi for one, low all you can eat price!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now; both times were all-you-can-eat.  I absolutely loved it the first time.  The second time failed to live up to my inflated expectations.  To summarize the Oyshi experience: good sushi in a nice atmosphere with unpredictable service.  Some items come out after the appropriate amount of time while others take an inexplicably long time to arrive."}
{"text":"Came in solo as a traveler on a Wednesday early evening. Pretty limited clientele at the time, buy you can tell the ambience stays pretty relaxed and fun. Staff was nice, but not necessarily consistent  (few grumpy folks when I stayed at the sushi bar, but maybe more so cause I eventuality just put my headphones on).   Sushi and sashimi were both quality (sorry not a roll guy much). However, they weren't very traditional in preparation, as some sushi didn't come with the traditional automatic wasabi between rice and cut, or the brush. Not a big deal.   They offer an endless option for $32 or $37 For lunch or dinner respectfully.  I'm sure it would be worth it with the higher end, expensive rolls.   Overall, I'd definitely come again, and/or bring friends. Solid local option."}
{"text":"This is mainly an all you can eat sushi restaurant. The restaurant had a very pleasant and modern appearance. This location is great for large parties as there is a ton of space for it. Just keep in mind that parties larger than 8 ppl would include a service fee.   All you can eat includes an appetizer, sushi, specialty rolls and dessert for $27 (dinner price). It does not include sashimi which is standard at most AYCE restaurants. We sat at the bar which was really the best place to be. We had the opportunity to talk to Chef Daniel who made some of his recommendations and made us some sushi rolls that were off the menu.  Honestly, his creations should be part of the menu as they were unique and excellent.   The appetizer menu was very extensive with plenty of options! Every single dish we tried was fresh and very tasty. The only roll I did not like was the spider roll. It appeared the eel was fried hours before and was not very fresh. Overall, I was very happy with the atmosphere, service and the quality of the food!"}
{"text":"I ordered a la carte, and when I first looked at the menu, I thought to myself, \"The pricing is on the in-expensive side\". Then the food arrived.   The cuts of fish were smaller than I am used to. So taking portion size into account, the a la carte pricing is fair. Which leads to this point: I think that part of the draw of this place is that they have an \"AYCE\" (All-You-Can-Eat) menu. The AYCE price is equivalent to what I paid for my a la carte meal (as described below).  As for my experience, I ordered: miso soup with clams; a California roll; tuna sushi, salmon sushi, Cajun tuna sushi, and halibut sushi. These are standard items, and I felt it would provide me with good gauge of the quality of their fish. The quality of the fish was very good.  Would I go again? Sure. But I would go for the AYCE.  BTW... the kitchen closes at 1:30am most nights (check the site for operating hours). Not bad for the suburbs."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 15' * 12/100  They say you can only joke about a bad experience after a certain length of time. It's been a month since I paid over $100 for an all-you-can-eat for 2 and looking back, it taught me a few things.  My friend and I are currently on the hunt for great sushi places in town and this being the closest to our homes, we made it our first stop. I have fond memories of the previous sushi place that took up this space and for some reason, I was expecting the same quality food and service.   After having waited about 10-15 minutes for a seat in a half empty restaurant, we approached the hostesses in haste when we saw more recent customers led to a table before us. We had a young female server that busy Friday night. Famished from work, we were ready to go on a devouring spree which started with a plate of edamame. The fun began with their specialty rolls such as the red rock, red dragon, and surf 'n' turf - my favorite. The surf 'n' turf consisted of a thin slice of rib eye steak placed above the roll and a shrimp tempura tucked inside. Great combination topped with eel sauce, if I remember well.  Things went downhill from there. We should've just eaten all the sushi we wanted before getting dessert. Back then, I didn't know if 1 dessert per person was the rule of thumb for all sushi buffets but it certainly shocked us when our server gave us our check after crème brûlée. We gave over half in cash and said to charge the rest on my card but the whole amount was charged on my card and the cash was also taken in. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought it might have been a flimsy mistake. After getting in touch with the manager, our cash was refunded, but only after much hassle to the restaurant and ourselves.   The food quality was good but some improvement could be made to service. Might come back again."}
{"text":"I stopped here by chance when I was walking around searching for a restaurant for dinner.  The reviews on Yelp were good, so I went in!  What struck me is that it seems to be a family-owned/operated restaurant, which I like.  Seating was a bit tight, but cozy.  Though if you want private conversations, you may go elsewhere.  I could hear every word of the neighbors' conversation.  Service was prompt, and I ordered a small Sapporo beer to start.  I was pleasantly surprised when edamame came with it (though another reviewer said that it comes complimentary with a meal).  I ordered the sashimi dinner (20 pieces) and sadly I could not finish it all - which says a lot for me since I have an enormous appetite!  One of the fish varieties tasted a bit off to me, so I did not eat those pieces.  But all in all, everything was delicious (especially the salmon).  Dinner came with rice, miso soup, and salad.  The salad had a yummy (seemed homemade) dressing with bits of ginger in it - just the right amount and not over-powering.  I'd go back!"}
{"text":"There is absolutely nothing to dislike about this place. Everything is made with top quality ingredients, the prices are excellent and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Really tasty, fresh sushi and great service.  I was ordering piecemeal from the Sushi menu and they recommended a studio/tempura combo that saved me a ton and even customized it for nigiri instead of a California roll.  Excellent value, nice atmosphere, and warm-up helpful staff."}
{"text":"First, I would like to say that I am not AYCE kinda gal.  I just don't eat that much (contrary to what my appearance may say) but in this case I think it was worth it.  We went for lunch so it was a $21 price.  But if you figure most of the rolls I liked cost about $10-$12 anyways, 2 rolls and you are there.  Plus it's your choice of different things from the menu, not just sushi.  But there are rules, and not EVERYTHING on the menu is part of the AYCE.  There is a bit of lag time on getting your food, so don't go running in thinking you are going to be out in 15 minutes.  But do go with the expectation of enjoying the company you went with.  Our server was great and the food was really good."}
{"text":"The service is okay, depends on which server you get. The first time eating here our server was great. Food came out fast & tasted good. Second time eating here our server was nice but very slow. It was a long wait for the food & by the time it came out our \"crispy\" rolls weren't so crispy. Eating here for the third time was just like the second. I would say the service & quality of food is inconsistent. The sushi's okay, had better else where."}
{"text":"We went last night for a friends birthday with a group of 15 people. Our server was apparently a sushi chef there as well as a server. He should probably give up serving and be a sushi chef because the service was terrible. His excuse at the end was that he was training two other new servers. The craziest part was there was NO manager in the whole place to correct any of the issues we had! You bet he added gratuity to the check at the end though! We all happen to work in the industry, most of us down on the strip and this wouldn't fly where we work. We all sat down and ordered all you can eat around 7:30 pm. The gap between drink service and ordering was pretty long. Ok so we can handle that I guess. When we finally were able to order food came out and half of it was missing throughout this long dragged out dinner. We were missing rolls, appetizers and soup. We mentioned it a few times but we never got it. By 9:23 we were so annoyed we asked for separate checks. Now we had told him this from the beginning. I know I'm use to producing and running up to 20 separate checks at a time and it takes me about 8 min to separate them and then another 8 to process payments. We timed it and literally did not get our check back till 10pm when we all started to head up to the front of the restaurant just so we could get out of there. No apologies, no compensation and 18% added to the checks. Food was average for what we were able to try because half of it didn't come out. Stay away from this location. They just take your money and waste your time!"}
{"text":"I went to Oyshi for All you can eat last week. The all you can eat menu is huge!! there is so much to choose from and everything we ate was great! The atmosphere is great, the food is delicious and fresh, and the presentation if fantastic. They also play trance music - ha!  Dishes I liked: Hamachi Trio Roll Alaskan Roll Dynamite (MMM)  There was a lot more but I can't remember anymore. The only one I wasn't so keen on was the cayenne albacore (this wasn't that great).   for $26 per person for dinner, this is a great deal especially because you can easily eat more than that value!"}
{"text":"Me and the wife love this place. The food is excellent. Service is slow at times, but the All you can eat price makes up for it."}
{"text":"Oyshi is the closest AYCE sushi to my house, so I've been here quite a lot. Not my favorite place, but it's a solid option. The decor is very modern and trendy. They also play EDM music and have sports showing on the flat screens near the bar. All postitives in my eyes. I always sit at the bar, so the service is good. Normally I can just order directly from the sushi chef without waiting for a waiter. That really speeds up the ordering process. I can't speak to the service when seated anywhere else in the restaurant.  One disappointing thing about Oyshi is that it doesn't offer seafood salad on the AYCE menu. That automatically prevents it from a five star review in my eyes. On the bright side, the amount of fish on the nigiri sushi is ample. Very high fish to rice ratio. I also like the variety of desserts offered. You're not limited to the usual mochi or ice cream. Oyshi also offers creme brulee and a berry parfait. The berry parfait is my usual and it's a must have."}
{"text":"You have to come and experience one of the best all you can eat sushi bars in Las Vegas . People I am telling you that this is quality sushi .. Not cheap crap. QUALITY .. The appetizer menu is also available for all you can eat . It's the best ! I go nowhere else when I am in Vegas for All you can eat sushi ."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi was great! As well as the desserts. Great customer service. Even though it was busy our server made sure that we were happy with the service provided. The music makes it fun as well. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"First time ever that I have had all you can eat sushi this style. Why doesn't New Orleans have this?? All you can eat on the menu for around $21! This deal more than filled my stomach.   We started off with the grilled beef asparagus and baked green mussel. I love the beef that wraps around the asparagus which gives it a great taste to the asparagus. The sauce on the baked green mussel is also perfect.   Overall i had  a great experience. We ordered most of the special rolls on the menu. I will definitely come back whenever I am back in town!"}
{"text":"The food was not memorable but the service was, for all the wrong reasons: server forgot or \"forgot\" to put our order in, so half the table got food while the other half waited.  She did this repeatedly.  We were on a business meeting so our group didn't notice as much, but still, come on.  This was just as bad as the last time I went.  Probably will be the last time I ever go.  There are a lot of great sushi joints in this part of town.  Don't need to come back here again.  Good luck to you guys!"}
{"text":"BS +++  I WANT SOME POKE!!!! (If you are Pinoy say it out loud lol).  Sushi for days! I can't rave about this place enough.  From the staff, to location, to the damn-bomb-food.  Legit sushi spot without the \"fusion\" stuff a lot of restaurants are trying to push.  If it's sushi make it sushi.  Stop changing it Vegas!! First, hats to the sushi masters for doing it right.  Amazing kitchen staff that keeps getting challenged and dishing food out.  I ordered a lot today (mainly the spicy tuna and salmon variety).  I was impress of the portion and consistency.  I will definitely come back here.  I challenge any big eater to come here.  $27 per person for dinner is a steal considering  some of these dishes will cost you $15 a roll.  The parking area is a bit packed and this place seems busy.  Come at night!  PROPS TO OUR WAITRESS!  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage). Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!"}
{"text":"Pros: Tiger roll was tasty but not crunchy enough Cons: They do not offer half rolls on AYCE Dragon roll sucked Baked salmon was dry Sizzling chicken teriyaki dry & not enough teriyaki No crispy rice on menu No berries on the 'BERRY' parfait Crème brûlée took forever to come out Check was presented before dessert as server had forgotten we had ordered it Slow water refills  Overall poor service and mediocre food  Will not be returning to this location"}
{"text":"I came here with some co-workers after a recommendation from a friend.  The chefs are so funny and the atmosphere is really friendly.  I tried the Red Dragon roll and the Caterpillar roll- so delicious.  The best part: their dipping sauce. I have no idea what their sauce is made out of because it's sweet and it has sesame seeds in it.  Although their AYCE was a little pricey, it's worth it.  Savor every bite when you go!"}
{"text":"Came here on Super Bowl Sunday with some family for a late lunch (around 2pm) so it wasn't that busy. I heard good things about this place so I was eager to try. I loved the modern, spacious atmosphere inside. Our waiter (Ray) was very courteous and overall service was nothing to complain about. I went for the AYCE and was not disappointed. For nigiri I got several orders of salmon and halibut. I can't describe how fresh it all tasted. The sashimi just melted in my mouth which I can't say has happened before so I knew this place was the real deal. I also got the salmon avocado hand roll which was also quite good. The last thing I got was the Yellowtail Trio roll which also tasted very fresh and flavorful. Of course I couldn't leave without dessert so I got the green tea creme brulee. Definitely coming back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"The lunch specials here are amazing!! The staff is always friendly and while they're always busy it's never too long of a wait for a seat. There is not a full bar so I docked it a star, personal preference really(not a beer drinker)."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm a sushi chef.  I had the all you can eat here. For the fish, which you should always have first, was poor quality.  I gave that a 2.   As for the rolls if you like deep fried and spicy sauce all the way I gave it a 3.5 but it gets tiring real fast.  Many of the rolls where they say soft shell crab mix, only means 95% imitation crab mixed with 5% soft shell crab.  Was horrible.  Anyway I'm pretty sure if your not a sushi advocate then this place will be just as good for you, but I'm use eating good, real good so I'll give it an average rating of 3. The server was on point though.  Had to end it off with something nice i suppose."}
{"text":"I've never been to a sushi buffet like this before.  Normally, places like Todai, Onami (now Tora in San Diego) have it set up where you walk up to the sushi bar and the rolls are there waiting for you to pick them up, at the same time they have a hot plate station, as well as desserts.  Oyshi is totally different due to the fact that you choose from the menu what you would like from the buffet section and it is made fresh for you to munch on.  Sushi is not the only thing part of the buffet menu, there are the small appetizer sushi's as well as tempura vegetables.  The best part are the specialty rolls, they are so freakin delicious.  I can't remember each of their names, but the cajun specialty roll, and the whatever screaming whatchamacalit are so damn good!  The ambience is pretty stylish and nice and I give them more props for playing house progressive music as we dine.  The staff is uber nice, especially since we went in a massive group that was pretty loud and would have drove most servers bonkers d bobcat.  Definitely gonna want to come here again next time I make a trip back out to visit the family in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I've been coming here since it first opened. I've never gotten food poisoning here but if I did I wouldn't turn my back on it. Sushi is sushi. If you order sushi raw then you're taking a risk for food poisoning. It goes for any sushi restaurant because it's raw. Even if handled properly. There's always that small percent... But customer service just needs a little improvement. Overall the food is great!!!"}
{"text":"It's not my absolute favorite sushi or AYCE sushi restaurant, but it's good and the location is wonderful. If there's an AYCE option at a sushi restaurant, I always order it because the price equals 2-3 specialty rolls. It just doesn't make sense any other way. Besides specialty rolls, I like hand rolls (tuna, salmon, yellowtail) and certain appetizers depending on my mood. I wasn't impressed with their hand rolls and although their specialty rolls are good, they're not amazing either (I've had better counterparts at other AYCE restaurants). I really like their DOUBLE SCREAMING ROLL (without cream cheese) because the special sauce makes it unique. Their desserts are really good too. I like that they offer a PARFAIT that features ice cream, fresh assorted berries, and granola. Very good. On my most recent trip, I found out I could get Green Tea ice cream rather than Vanilla and it was even more amazing. The service is good and the food is usually quick. The only thing I really hate is the restaurant's lack of appropriate venting, so you end up leaving the place smelling like the inside of a fryer."}
{"text":"This is a decent place for AYCE. Price is reasonable. And the fish are mostly fresh. Not the best but I would go again."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! I was first brought to Oyshi by a friend and since then, I've been back  6 times with the same friend, other friends, and my boyfriend. It is now his favorite sushi bar in Las Vegas! Service is good, fish is always fresh, desserts are tasty, and the facility is gorgeous! They also consistently play my favorite songs."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for AYCE sushi. I love their green tea tiramisu cake. The AYCE price isn't bad as well. The restaurant is clean and bigger than their rainbow location. Customer service is okay, i guess it depends on how slow or busy they get. Sometimes you have to wait 5-10 minutes in the waiting area before someone even acknowledges you and hence the 3 stars. They woulda gotten 4 but I don't know if the guy was just having a bad day or what."}
{"text":"Got HORRIBLE food poisoning here.   So did the whole entire birthday party that I was with. Ate here on a Thursday late night, and started what felt like an exorcism that Saturday. I had to miss work on the weekend which is my money maker and it SUCKED so bad! I've never called into work or left early in 7 years and this did it for me. I've never thrown up so much throughout the whole entire night and next couple days like I did from this place. Holy crap, I will never eat sushi for as long as I live ever again. Thanks for completely ruining it for me.   Please be careful here. They obviously screwed something up. But do they care? Probably not."}
{"text":"Mono was,awesome!!! He really made our experience great..he suggested a sake that was,exactly wat we were looking for. Loved it! We will b back! :)"}
{"text":"I just recently discovered Oyshi Sushi, and my first experience was at their Rainbow location. The vibe was totally urban trend, great atmosphere and the sushi was excellent and fresh.  Today we tried the Sahara location, being that it was closer to our side of town. I regret not making the drive to Rainbow.   This Sahara location is very disorganized, dirty, no hot water in the bathrooms and the quality... well I have seen better technique at my local Smith's grocery. Sushi is all about the rice first, and this place must use Uncle Ben's Minute Rice.... microwave version. Please have some leadership behind the (sushi) bar and maintain quality. It's not far to ruin the brand name and possibly turn away business from your Rainbow location.    It is night and day between this location and Rainbow. Very sad that the consistency is so far off.   I regret wasting my sushi crave today on this place..  two thumbs down."}
{"text":"This sushi place is both mine and my husbands #1 choice! We are both huge sushi lovers, and have tried many sushi places and this is by far the best one. We start of by getting an appetizer each and 5-6 rolls and a dessert for each and our bill always comes out to less than $60! Def worth every cent! Music is great, staff very friendly the whole atmosphere makes us keep going back! Makes it very hard to want to try a new place."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi ever! The sashimi, sushi or rolls are to die for! Great service and great food. This is the place to go!"}
{"text":"So me and my friend asked for water THREE TIMES AND NO ONE WOULD GIVE US ANY.  We've been seated for about 20 minutes and literally everyone got their drinks but us."}
{"text":"i am a very picky person when it comes to food. everyone i come here i am pleased. every bing is made perfectly right. the all you can eat prices are very reasonable and the staff are exceptional. i will not go to any other sushi restaurant for sure. so if you're lothat's king for a great affordable all you can eat sushi restaurant, be sure to go here. :)"}
{"text":"I was hoping for better quality sushi but unfortunately they cook the shrimp tempura in advance so it was cold in my roll. The service is good, my food came out really quick but at the sacrifice of quality. The sushi was mediocre at best, nothing to brag about or ever the need to come back."}
{"text":"My family is a big fan of sushi. My daughter and I can live on sushi everyday! Oyshi is a wonderful neighborhood sushi restaurant. It's not a very big place, so be prepared to wait for a table, especially at dinner time!  Oyshi is our favorite AYCE restaurant. Lunch is $22, and dinner is $27 for ages 12 and over.  Lunch $16, dinner $19 for under 12. Beverage is not included in the price. Be aware that party of 6 or more an 18% gratuity will be automatically added to the bill.  I almost always order the Miso soup. It's very light on flavor but very comforting to eat. The Fresh Oysters are very fresh, served with refreshing salsa! Only 2 pieces per person in the AYCE dinner only! At lunch they charge dinner price for them. You can order unlimited items from the appetizers. Love their Baked Oysters! Easy to pick from the shells because they are separated and halfway cut. The Shrimp Tempura is lightly covered and not grease, served with dipping sauce. My newest discovery is the Yakitori (2 skewers per order). I love the Shrimp and asparagus! Seriously, I can eat a whole plate of that! My other favorite item is the Japanese Lasagna. I make sure to order it all the time. I believe Oyshi makes them the best! Everyone's favorite is the Monster! Spider roll with shrimp tempura, topped with baked eel and avocado, with eel sauce. Bonsai: spicy tuna roll with Cajun albacore and avocado on top. Sexy: yum-yum scallop, cream cheese and crunch flakes inside, topped with eel tempura, with wasabi mango and eel sauce. My BF really likes the Crunch Scallop: Oyshi scallop, crab mix and avocado with popcorn scallops on top, with wasabi mango and eel sauce.  After eating all these food, I always wonder, how much more a person can eat? Well, we always get dessert, too! My absolute favorite is the Mango Mochi (ice cream wrapped in rice dough). The Green Tiramisu is very tempting, too! I really liked the green tea flavor in it! It's a house made tiramisu cake infused with green tea. My daughter's favorite is the Vanilla or Green tea ice cream.  Service is always very attentive! Our iced tea is always refilled!  Happy to return anytime!"}
{"text":"Me and Jessie B. wanted to try someplace new so we ended up here. And boy were we glad we did! The service was top notch and the rolls were huge and yummy!! The price was great as well for lunch..I think it was 21 bucks! They have a full bar but we came for the sushi. And I am sure we will be back soon."}
{"text":"After driving by this sushi place many, many times I finally decided it was a good night for take out-i ordered a veggie roll and Alaskan roll.......very disappointed...the Alaskan roll was mainly all rice, hardly any salmon, a sliver of asparagus and a smidge of avocado.  Won't be going back"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot!service was very good. Food was very tasteful love the whole atmosphere not over crowded drink were on point . I'll be back with friends and family"}
{"text":"The restaurant is styled really cool, it has a few different styles but not too much going on. While having an open floor plan but still having your privacy In-between each table. Our waiter was awesome and super laid back. We got along right off the bat and he was able to tell the bartender to make a whiskey sour although It wasn't on the drink menu. The waiters name is Kenny, he was really understanding after the over servers brought out the wrong food, and forgot to bring out some of the rolls we ordered. He was willing to not include it on the bill on his behalf, with no questions or hassle making us feel really relieved that we didn't have to try and finish these extra rolls that we didn't like nor order. Don't get me wrong the food is amazing, but there are some things I'm not interested in but every time I come I'm never disappointed in what I order."}
{"text":"We ended up leaving without eating. Walked in and stood at the hostess area with no hostess. A server acknowledged us and then a few minutes later another server slowly came over and slowly as though she were drunk or had no idea what to do with us started gathering Menus.  She took us to the upper section where nobody was sitting.  I've had a bad experience with service here so we were weary to sit up there.  We asked if we could sit in another section and I guess that was an inconvenience.  We ended up leaving.  They weren't friendly at all.  They were even laughing at us when we left! I don't care if the food is good! I'll never spend my money there again!"}
{"text":"Food is always fantastic. However the floor management is very poor. It is frustrating to stand and wait at the door when only 2 seats are occupied at the bar and half the tables. Then to be sat at the bar 15 minutes later and all seats are still open. They either do not have enough servers or just poor table management. Whoever owns this restaurant needs to spend more time to see the flow of service and the dissatisfaction of the guests. Our server was very good by the way."}
{"text":"AYCE for the win! With some beer and good company, it'll be a great meal for any occasion."}
{"text":"OMG OH MY GOODNESS.... the best of the best Sushi. We have tried so many places be our best Sushi guy left us for Hawaii so we are trying to capture the same experience and let me tell you. Their Sushi is just the same the best. Made with love. Fresh as fresh can be. Atmosphere is amazing and you have to sit at the bar. The guys are great. So if you are looking for a damn good Sushi place you must try Oyshi!!! Hands Down. The only bad thing I can say as of right now they don't have Green Tea ice cream. But the food take the cake on that which I am okay on it. So be sure and try this amazing place you will love it!!!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. The food was excellent and the service was great. I went there with my wife and mother and 3 kids. It was the day after Mother's day since my dear wife had to work on Mother's day.  We loved pretty much every thing that we ordered. Now like all the all you can eat places in Vegas you can order sashimi but only as sushi and they make you eat everything.  Still at 25 dollars a person and 20 for kids it was well worth what we paid.  If there was one negative it was that at such a small place they still added 18% gratuity onto the bill. I would have tipped much more than that if they didn't add it.  We really loved the Lobster Fair and the Las Vegas Roll. Especially the Las Vegas since it didn't have any rice.  I do think that the staff needs better training. Although they were sweet and charming they did mess up a couple of times on the order. But we did order a lot and there were at least 3 people ordering. I guess I wouldn't have done as well as they did."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I'm not a fan of sea food but my husband is so we come here often. He always gets the unlimited sushi and I get the sizzling steak plates! Great atmosphere and great service!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect and struggled with deciding to go with the all you can eat option as I'm a small girl. Well...it was a great decision! All of the rolls are amazing, particularly the Oyshi roll and then you can change it up with a sizzling plate of skirt steak or some veggie tempura. Yum!"}
{"text":"I had ordered the sashimi dinner and a Japanese lasagna. The most disgusting sashimi I had ever tasted. If you want real good sashimi I would HIGHLY recommend Sushi Ko. THEY HAVE THE BEST SASHIMI!! Even though their prices are a bit higher than Oyshi Sushi, it is definitely worth it. And don't even get me started with the miso soup. It was so watery and had no flavor AT ALL. I had to throw most of my food away because it was that bad. Honestly a waste of my money."}
{"text":"My experience at Oyshi was pleasant. I thought the staff was courteous and got all of our orders right.   We had all you can eat and I enjoyed pretty much everything I ate. We ate AYCE so we had to pace ourselves or else you will get charged for wasted food.  I would start with the salad and calamari (2 dipping sauces) Some things that I really enjoyed were the Surf and Turf (good steak and grilled shrimp) dynamite roll and monster roll. For dessert I always enjoy a classic creme brûlée. The berry parfait was a berry ice cream Sundae and that was nice too. Only thing I was ehhh about for dessert was the green tea tiramisu cause it tasted like a heavier creamed cake with a very buttery taste.   Overall I thought it was a nice location with nice atmosphere. Service was fine and good was good. Would I say that is the best sushi place in town? Not quite but I am not disappointed and I would come back again."}
{"text":"Loving this place. I used to cone at the Rainbow location but here is even better. Sushi is great and service is quick . Will come back ."}
{"text":"Best place to go to pig out on fresh sushi....I don't get the negative reviews,,,,,been here several times always good, never got sick,,,rather go here than thanksgiving turkey We took a friend and he was amazed that there was so much variety...I guess he played it safe before with California rolls and never had \"sushi\" or sashimi.  Trust my Japanese relatives being an Aryan....Try the fish collar if you want an upgrade"}
{"text":"I went to Oyshi Sushi for a team lunch. Oyshi Sushi is a nicely decorated sushi restaurant in the downtown area. There were nine of us, but the staff was friendly and able to accommodate us. We ordered from the lunch menu.  I ordered the salmon bento box. The food was very good and the portion was very large. Everybody seems to enjoy their food.  Would we go back? Yes, because the food is good and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi! I'm in. Come hungry. Reasonable price. Nice staff. The baked mussels are divine. Loved the Japanese Lasagna roll. Oysters. Don't get me started. Yum. Just remember, if you can't finish it, you pay full price on it."}
{"text":"Oyshi!!! Arigato gozaimasu!!!!!!!!!  Best AYCE!  Super fresh!  Best service from our server, Iris!!! (Belated Happy Birthday!!!)  From beginning to end our experience exceeded my every expectations.   I love love love the sushi!!!   We will definitely come back when we are in town."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best sushi I've had. The prices are amazing for the quality of sushi you get. I love the staff they're so friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for sushi. The AYCE is such a great value, especially during lunch. We love the nigiri sushi, ahi poke, shrimp tempura and their desserts. Their rolls are usually pretty good but I usually go with my husband and he's not big on rolls so it's harder to finish it on my own. The nigiri sushi allows us to order more variety. Their cocktails are also really good. They have cocktail specials during the week. They're also known for their sizzling platters."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Some of us went for the AYCE and wow! Didn't have to wait long for the food to start coming even though the places was packed. A must bust in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great food, I always come for their all you can eat sushi. The rolls out of this world, my go to sushi place, it does get busy sometimes though."}
{"text":"Quality sushi! Friendly staff and excellent service! Helpful and not too fast but very efficient!"}
{"text":"I have visited this place a totally of 3 times and this last visit on Saturday March 11th around 7:00pm will be my last! First off I'm a manager at a retail store and customer service is a must!! So from the jump I should of know to leave and let me tell you why, it was a busy night for them obviously being a Saturday night which is totally understandable but after i proceed to put my name down,  I headed to the bathroom while in the bathroom i found myself having to listen to one of the front hostess in the bathroom on the phone cussing, crying, saying how she hates her job and the manager and so on and so on... sad part is after i came out the stall the young girl (she was the short dark hair fake lashes and could of been Mexican but look like she had some Asian in her)  just looked at me while continuing her rant. So feeling uncomfortable i went to the front to ask for the manager and just my luck she had walked up, i told her about the incident and she said she would go see the situation and figure out who the employee in the bathroom was. After that happen we were told 45min wait time which turned in to more than an hour wait again understand its busy just make sure you are telling customer the right wait times then. So as we waited to be seated the ball of sunshine aka the girl that hates her job was the one to seat us which again her attitude came out..... while she just turned from the desk and looked at me and said You can come this way with the rudest tone and attitude.. last time i checked most places call you by name or greet you by your name before taking you back to the table. But of course not her. Then as the food started coming out the quality was horrible, sushi taste old and fishy, not worth the price they are charging. So needless to say i will not be returning here anytime soon and i hope the owner or someone higher up see this because even after the manager knew the hostess had an attitude and everyone could tell she did, the manager should of pulled her aside and talked to her or sent her home especially being the first person your customers interact with, i wouldn't think that is the type of person you would want as a hostess."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday afternoon with some friends for some drinks and sushi. It's January 1 and surprisingly not busy. Despite of having a few customers, we still had to wait a long time for food. On top of that I also ordered a bottle of Asahi and sake. It took them 45 min to serve drinks that suppose to be the easiest thing to do. I've eaten here before and the service was way different from what I experienced. Really disappointed in the overall outcome of dining here. I couldn't give the place a half a star for some reason so I settled with one."}
{"text":"As of now, we have been waiting for 2 rolls as of 15 minutes ago. I decided to write the review and time myself until it gets to my table. The food tastes great, great quality, inside looks hip. But alas, my food is taking a WHILE. I waited 5 mins to post... 20 mins total for a rattle snake and a chicken teryaki roll."}
{"text":"My favorite all-you-can-eat sushi in town. Delicious, fresh, and great service. Fun atmosphere. Love the sizzling plates and their tiger roll."}
{"text":"Came for the 2nd time and it was even better than the first. Great food and the service today was the best I've had in a sushi restaurant.  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Chef ed Super sexy motherfucker... that can make a great chefs special. Great service and fresh sushi! Definitely  recommend to family and friends..."}
{"text":"Difficult to find a decent sushi restaurant in the financial district and harbourfront.  However, Oyshi Sushi provides good service and food, in a cozy, casual setting.    I have been here for lunch with colleagues during the week and I definitely suggest making reservations as it has always been full.  Dinners usually cater to people like myself, who live in the area.   The restaurant itself is very small with traditional Japanese decor.  There are a couple curtained private booths, a few tables, and there is seating at the sushi bar.   The portions are good, and the quality of both the raw and cooked foods have not yet left me disappointed.   Happy to have found this somewhat hidden gem in my neighbourhood to satisfy my regular sushi cravings."}
{"text":"Such slow service! There were 6 empty tables and we waited 20 minutes just to get seated. On top of that we had to wait another 15 minutes for someone to come get our order. And when our server finally got to us, she stopped us abruptly and we didn't even finish ordering. Horrible service."}
{"text":"So food was decent but our server ( fat dude with a beard ) was the slowest server i ever had. I wanted to order so i called him and he said just one second, after 20 minutes i had to call him again. He even walks slow. I understand that it was busy but him not coming and walking slow makes me never want to come back here. I wish i had a different server. If anybody is reading this and coming here, make sure to avoid the table he is serving. I hope the management take action."}
{"text":"Went for AYCE lunch today.  $22/pp.  Was there with 6 others.  I gotta say that I have eaten AYCE in many places and in many states, and this by far is rated at the bottom of my list.  The only reason for 2 stars is good service from the waiter, and good green tea ice cream.  Sometimes the ice cream can be a turnoff too, but not here.  The fish was horribly fishy and tasted old.  I grew up on an island and know fish pretty well...this fish thumbs down.  I had tuna, salmon, octopus, albacore, and the treasure.  I had to choke it down.  Under normal circumstances, I would have 3-4 rolls, and about 10 orders of nigiri, with sides of apps.  When I arrived, I was not greeted by any staff, but was looked at by about 5 of them.  I was standing right by the \"Wait to be seated\" sign, and nothing.  Nothing from even the sushi chefs (who also looked right at me.)  I even had 2 staff walk in right pass me coming to work I guess.  I am told that they have another restaurant on Sahara/Tenaya.  Well sorry to say, I will not be going to either one.  If you are in the area and need sushi, go to 808 Sushi or SOHO.  Better food and better prices."}
{"text":"Went there for the AYCE and the food was really great. They even made something for my vegetarian girlfriend. Service was good too. Overall, had a great experience.."}
{"text":"First time here and was good. Ayce for lunch contains a lot of items. They don't have gluten free soy sauce. I had the usual stuff and was good. Little too much rice for me. I ended up taking some off was just too much. Japanese lasagne was the best thing on the menu"}
{"text":"Hostess had a horrible attitude. If the restaurant advertises that it is supposed to close at a certain time, they should stay true to it. My party walked in at 9:45pm when there were still about 5 tables in the restaurant. The restaurant is supposed to close at 11:00pm. The hostess with a look of disgust on her face says \"we're closed\" with no further explanation. Having this memory of this place will always leave a bitter taste in my mouth.  I've eaten here before and I can honestly say service is pretty bad and the food is not that amazing. The fish quality is poor and the food is far from special.  The oysters were enjoyable but are not on the AYCE menu.   SOHO on Jones is my go to Sushi spot in town! (Although it is not AYCE, the food is of high quality and they have an amazing happy hour and it always comes out to be the same price as doing AYCE for me)."}
{"text":"Best AYCE in Vegas for low carb.  Rib eye appetizer and Sibuya not fried.  Keep them coming!!!!  Great service too and the best sushi chef Pedro!!!!"}
{"text":"Some buddies of mine and myself came here today and we all got the AYCE. We all left pretty satisfied with what we ate.  As with any group that is doing AYCE, we got to try a lot of the menu through coordinating orders and sharing with each other. From the appetizer section, to the desserts, everything we had was pretty tastey.   Some highlights were their surf and turf roll, fried gyoza, sweet shrimp nigiri and fried heads, eel nigiri, tamago nigiri, salmon belly nigiri, cajun albacore nigiri, and their baked mussels.  The only real low points with the food was that the super white tuna wasn't that good, and each person could only have two orders of their awesome baked mussels.   The service from the staff was top notch. While it took awhile to get our food a couple of times when the restaurant got full and busy, the servers and what we assumed was the floor manager always made sure to check on our orders and help get stuff to our table. The floor manager even took our order a couple of times, cleared our table, and refilled our drinks on more than one occasion. The staff there was firing on all cylinders and was really attentive.   This was my second time coming here, and I really enjoyed the food and service again. I definetly will be coming back, and with more people. I would recommend coming to this place."}
{"text":"Great service and super fast. We had a raptors game to attend and they served us super fast even tho they had a few other customers.   Sushi tasted fresh and the teriyaki chicken was amazing.  I got the salmon dome(I think) and it was great. I will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"This little sushi treasure is not at all far from my home right down Rainbow. They have one of the largest sushi menus I have seen in Las Vegas and every roll on it is a winner in my book. It has been a while between when I went and when I am posting the review so I don't recall any specific roll names, I just know everything we ate, was excellent. The atmosphere is awesome and on the wknds they are open late. We love this place and are soon to be regulars."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I leave feeling disappointed. Today was no different.   I have been here on numerous occasions because this is where my friends want to go; ok, whatever.  We always come for AYCE dinner and the wait is always really long even with reservations.   Once we are seated, it usually takes them a couple minutes to get our drinks and then a while long for our orders. We are so aware of their efficiency, or lack thereof, we would write down on a piece of paper of what we want and then just hand it to them. Kudos to us!   The food would always take forever to arrive and the hot dishes are always what come out first. I never understand that since raw fish simply needs to be sliced and plated... Unless they wanna fill us up with the cheap stuff first...? Hmmmmmmm.   And once the food arrives, they are always subpar or mediocre. Nothing ever wows my husband and I.   Overall, service is extremely slow. This should be a french japanese fusion restaurant in the sense that it's gonna be a three hour meal eating japanese food. The food is mediocre. The price is not spectacular. I would never come back if I can help it.   Oh, it's the same slowness at lunch, by the way. Most items on the menu is around $10-$12. The non sushi dishes came out first for my group today and halfway through their meal, my sushi bowl came out - mediocre yet again.   That was my last straw; I am going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I feel anguish writing this because we loved Oyshi so much. My kids ask for it all the time, especially their birthdays. We have been to this location at least monthly since it opened, at around $100 a pop. But in the last six months the service has gone from decent to TERRIBLE. We just waited 40 minutes after being seated to order entrees. Forgot the miso. Have you ever been so angry that you just had to leave without even getting the entree? That is right now. Just there a few weeks ago and they forgot to bring my dinner until after everyone was finished eating, and brought the miso with the freaking check. The time before that, they totally forgot my tempura vegetables side order. I don't know if they need to fire these servers, train them better or if the managers are assigning the tables in a way that makes it so that they only come to your table every 30 to 40 minutes... But something needs to change. Tl/Dr: excellent food... if they remember to take your order or bring it to you."}
{"text":"So we have been to Oyshi several times for different occasions. Great place to go when casual or if you want to get dressed up for date night. We love the all you can eat menu.  Many options and the mochi is the best dessert."}
{"text":"AYCE Sushi for $26?  Ladies nights I think is Thurs after 10PM...for $21?  How do you beat that?  Well, with good sushi of course!  The amount of items you can pick off of the AYCE menu are aawesome...  You can get oysters, poke, and all of the sushi you want...of course, Sashimi doesn't count, but hey, get it all.  I like how you can pick a lot of the sides in the AYCE menu as well, particularly the seaweed salad, and the oysters...    VERY good value, good quality food, fresh sushi, and a good atmosphere to boot.  Only thing is that service can get a little non-attentive, but they're serving everyone pretty much everything, so just make sure you check up on the many things you order."}
{"text":"compared to the sushi buffets in LA, ive gotta give oyshi 3 stars. the 2 things that trumps LA's sushi buffet is they serve seaweed salad and you get dessert at the end! main reason why it doesnt beat LA's sushi buffet: fish isnt as fresh and no sashimi!  what i recommend: seaweed salad, tempura, tofu appetizer, mango mochi icecream, green tea tiramisu, eel & avocado hand roll  the raw fish itself is alright, it's not that fresh...i would rate it 7/10"}
{"text":"Went back to Oyshi last Monday and the place was packed. A Little surprised but expected knowing this place is pretty popular. Anyway, did the AYCE again, but I ordered the Kami Kaze and NYI rolls. Word of warning, these things were HUGE. I thought the AYCE portions suppose to be smaller than the regular order. If this is smaller order, I'm afraid to ask what their regular size would be. These two rolls came out near the end of our meals and we were kinda full by that time already, so trying to stuff those two rolls down was a challenge. Next time, I won't order this roll unless I have 2 or 3 people to split it with. Anyway, the reason I reduced one star on this trip is that the sushi wasn't as fresh as my previous trip there. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't exceptional fresh either. I heard from some review, not sure if it's for Oyshi or Kobe, that it might be due to the fact that fish delivery comes on Tue, Thu and Sat."}
{"text":"Two thumbs up. Our new go to ayce sushi place in Vegas. Best and freshest tuna. Rolls amazing!!! Creme Brule to too off great dinner. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place recently because we were getting tired of our regular spot and we loved it! the service was quick and friendly and their AYCE menu had lots of great options. We had a few rolls, as well as oysters, a seaweed salad and tons of nigiri sushi. It was all fresh and delicious and came out promptly. I think we've found our new favorite spot! As much as we love our old place it really is hard to find a good sushi place that also gives good service but this place has both!"}
{"text":"Food is really good the only reason why I took off one star is because there service really really sucks at times! I get so surprised if they actually are doing well."}
{"text":"I can't give this place a 4 or 5 because the last time my friends and I went here the service was horrible...especially coming from a certain female server. She was slow with our orders and kind of stand-offish. I understand if you are having a bad night but don't ruin it for the customer.  Other than that, the food is great and I have never had any problems with it. The all-you-can-eat price is worth it especially if you know you are going to eat more than one roll including appetizers.  The ahi poke can use a little bit more pieces of tuna instead of being drowned in daikon and seaweed but it is still good."}
{"text":"Great sushi spot. My husband and I have been here a couple times. The food is great. I would recommend going during lunch before the dinner rush or you'll be waiting for 30-40 mins before being seated.   Customer service from \"some\" servers need to be re-evaluated or re-trained being that \"Las Vegas\" is a number one place of customer service (personal opinion)  Other than that it's a great restaurant, definitely one in our books for a eating spot with friends."}
{"text":"I had a couple issues eating here. 1) if you do not want AYCE, there is no al a carte menu. 2) I told the waiter $20 cash and the rest on the card (he used my card first and gave me $9 back in cash). Overall the service was okay and our waiter was kind. He also gave us complimentary salmon with pico de gallo that the chef wanted everyone to try. The sushi we ate was not the best I have ever had. If anything it was bland. I found that there was no unique sushi rolls that would keep me coming back. The only thing I did love, however, is the green tea creme brûlée (must try!!!)."}
{"text":"(I'm a Chef) This place was recommended to me by two people whom i will never, ever take seriously again when it comes to food.      Plus all the people that say this place is their favorite.. I feel like they are all clueless about food.. the service was ok but everything else was terrible..    Mochi- tasted like it came straight from sams club.. its filled with sugary nasty goup instead of ice cream.  Ribeye-the beef is most definitely the worst cut of beef you can buy..  indistinguishable from wal mart beef no flavor.. no fat.. terrible thick cuts.. what the hell are they serving it for.. but beef that you would use with teriyaki or take it off the menu.. its not Ribeye!  all the crab is fake.. which is typical for sushi places but this imitation crab again tasted like sams club crap..   Tuna.. i don't know what is up with that tuna but I've had a lot of sushi and this tuna tasted like it had been frozen thawed, frozen, thawed, frozen and thawed.. thats the only way i can describe the taste and texture... plus the poke..  Poke isnt really poke.. there was 3 pieces of tuna in it.. rest was seaweed, and cucumber... don't call it poke.. i love poke.. i came here because i was told the poke is great... this was not poke.. and if it was it was the worst poke I've ever had.  Service was good.. Sushi chefs were great..  food is crap."}
{"text":"Found this place using the Yelp mobile app (so glad I did) - they have an all-you-can-eat menu, plenty of specialty rolls, and the tempura is awesome!   Went with a big group of friends and everyone seemed to enjoy what they had. I got a spicy tuna handroll (yum) and one of the specialty tempura rolls which was also good. Service was a bit slow (hence the -1 star) but otherwise everything else was enjoyable!"}
{"text":"been here several times. 1st time was for my 24th birthday. they dont take reservations, which was hard to plan out with 18+ people, but they were able to accommodate all of us, and the people who trickled in late. for the amount of people we had, the service was great! they even gave me a small bottle of hot sake on the house for waiting :]  the foods always been consistent every time i've come back. im not too big on the rolls (although there are a few i like). i get my fill on the hot items and appetizer items. they've added salad bowls and rice bowls as well.  favorites: poke, seaweed salad, oysters (dinner only), ribeye (its not a complete meal if i dont order at least 5 orders for myself), hamachi, salmon, and a few others.   i only rated a 4 because service is never consistent. we sat at the bar one night, and had excellent service from our server (again, the name escapes me. i should really write these down!). another time, a group of maybe 9 or 10 of us went in for lunch, and if i remember right they were short handed at the sushi bar. hot food items came out before rolls did, and half of our groups didnt come out until the end of the meal (after asking servers several times about our food. the disappointing part was the table next to us got their food way before we did, and they sat well into half of our meal).   this place is definitely a must try, if you've never been. but a regular spot? probably not. as a college student, its hard to pay $30 (including tip) for one meal as often as i'd like to. but when i do have some extra money, i will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Lousy service, mediocre food, dry saba, had to ask for tea 3x, no half rolls, \"tip\" already added into the final bill, too cold in the side room and no way to adjust.   Why did I ever come here more than once?"}
{"text":"I'd been here about 5 times and I love the amazing all you can eat sushi they have here!  The fish is always fresh. I love their variety of  rolls,  appetizers, and dessert.  The price is decent for quality and amount of food you get. There usually is a wait I never had to wait more than 30 minutes, and I learn to go earlier or later then the rush hour times. The waiters/waitresses aren't attentive like in other reviews.  But then again, some Asians don't tip well, so I guess you don't need to tip them as much as other restaurant you normally go to."}
{"text":"Love it here , the fish is so fresh (surprising ) considering its in Vegas surrounded by the dessert . My friend and I are regulars and wouldn't go to any other spot   My favorite roll here is the sea urchin, ikara with quail egg and the spider roll  Price is very reasonable and well worth it for an all you can eat   Ed and Ryan are awesome !!!"}
{"text":"They have some of the best rolls I have ever tried, but their nigiris aren't the best. Their fish probably isn't as fresh as some other places but it's still decent. Some of my favorite rolls from Oyshi are the Snow Mountain Roll & the Kamikaze Roll. Not bad for lunch for $21"}
{"text":"Very fast service. Fair price. Great environment. Will come back"}
{"text":"I really love this sushi place. I prefer this location over Sahara's usually, but when I came here for my 21st, I wasn't impressed with the service. Sitting at the bar, the only way they would do half rolls, some rolls I ordered didn't come and the service was slow. I will come back because it was probably an off day."}
{"text":"I love Oyshi, I usually go to the location off of Rainbow. The service here is a little slower than the other one and it's not as personal. But such wonderful sushi at a reasonable price of ayce."}
{"text":"Oyshi was one of my favorite sushi restaurants until my most recent visit. When my family, and I arrived we waited six minutes to me seated there was no host so a waiter finally came to us and asked how many where in are group. It took the waiter over ten minutes to take are order. My wife and I order all you can eat sushi, we told the waiter which rolls we wanted to eat first that order took twenty minutes to arrive at my table. When we finished that order we had to ask a bus person to hunt down are waiters to place another order of sushi. We ended up spending over two hours eating sushi not because we ate so much but because it took for ever to place orders and to receive it. The sushi is not all good as I remember it being in the past I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Oyshi used to be one of my favorite binge eating locales, however the last time I went was an utter letdown.   What differentiated Oyshi from other \"All-you-can-eat\" sushi spots was the quality of the fish. What used to be fresh, now looks and tastes old. Basically, all of the nigiri sushi was disgusting; uni being the worst.   The cooked food is still good (hence two stars instead of one), but its \"All-you-can-eat SUSHI\", not \"All-you-can-eat-tempura-edamame-teriyaki-skewers\".   Would I go back? Probably not. I'd rather spend $5 more and go to a real buffet like the M Resort. At least you know the sushi is going to be sub par there and gravitate towards the other entrees."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite All You Can Eat sushi in Las Vegas. Always enjoy myself here with the friendly service and excellent rolls. The nuclear bomb roll is so delicious if you like your rolls more on the spicy side. I also love how I can finish off my meal with a Creme brûlée, which is included in the all you can eat."}
{"text":"ok i think i've mastered the art of the AYCE menu here now. lol  not sure why but the meal i had last night seemed to be better than my other visits. maybe because i didn't over order this time which i tend to do.  btw you may be wondering why i keep coming back here if i'm so unhappy with the service... it's because it's so close to where i stay.. and my friends like it and good company makes everything better.  so last night we started with some appetizers while we waited for a couple other friends to arrive. once they came we ordered rolls.. then continued with nigiri.. and finished off with dessert. a few appetizers were thrown in here and there.. and this strategy definitely worked.  stars of the night:  house salad: i really liked their dressing.. it was kinda a peanut ginger-y dressing. super refreshing and a decent size. it can definitely be shared  baked green mussels: not too fishy tasting and the sauce on top is super creamy and delicious  oysters: max order is 1 per person which comes with 4 oysters... tasty!   sexy roll: i believe it has fried unagi on top with yum yum scallops inside and a creamy mango sauce on top... my favorite of the night.  agedashi tofu: their version is really tasty. the tofu itself stays crisp on the outside even after its been sitting there for a few minutes.. and the sauce is perfect.. not bland at all  premium spider roll: with avocado and cream cheese and possibly unagi on top. cant remember but it was deeeelicious!  service was ok in the beginning but really began to slow down as it got busy. we were seated in the area sectioned off to the side so it was easy to forget about us.. and we sure felt forgotten at times.   as for dessert they were out of mochi the last time we were there.. this time they didnt have the strawberry. ooo my friends were super disappointed :(  tip: monday and tuesdays they have a 2 for 1 house sake special :)"}
{"text":"Oyshi sushi is a wonderful and spacious environment to spend time with friends. Their croquette with mustard and donkatsu sauce was diving. Our server mikey is fun and very attentive. My boyfriend ordered all the spicy rolls off of the all you can eat and he reports that they are spicy and good. Great features for all you can eat which include poke and they also have buy one get one free sake! Craving sushi? Come here            It's my second time here and the food is amazing as always. The seared garlic salmon seems smaller than before but maybe it is a smaller plate. The sushi is always fresh and the sake is delicious, ayce is an amazing deal. Our server Chloe is amazing and has friendly service as well as being very attentive. I will be coming back for the delicious sushi and wonderful service."}
{"text":"Cool set up. Solid basic sushi rolls. I didn't try too many of the more complex options. Amigo roll was good. Tasty hamachi nigiri. Great berry vanilla dessert. Had AYCE. Will try again. Prefer Kaizen etc"}
{"text":"Food was amazing but what really put the cherry on top was the service. Our server Stefan was great. Our drinks were never under half way, he checked on us every few minutes to see if we needed anything, and had a great attitude. For sure coming back."}
{"text":"I went here for all you can eat sushi for dinner. It was really good. I got the lava roll and another spicy roll that I cannot remember the name of. Since I love spicy I loved both rolls! I went with my friend and he ordered a couple rolls which I tried and they were good too. I don't remember which ones because he ordered it. I also tried sriracha sauce which was reallyyy good as well. It was $35 for all you can eat which isn't too bad. I would love to come back and try more rolls. For dessert I got mango mochi-yum yum!   I liked the location because it was right around the corner from my house-its always nice to have a sushi place nearby for when you have cravings. :)"}
{"text":"Dinged one star because this place always seems unnecessarily busy... It's pretty annoying when you're waiting for a table when there's four or more empty tables in the joint. Food is always great--standard sushi fare. I believe it's $27 for All You Can Eat dinner, also pretty standard."}
{"text":"Usually me and my family come here for sushi (AYCE) and today March 22 me and my girlfriend and sister came here (which they are visiting from a different state) and the service was terrible we were here for fifteen minutes and we were not even acknowledged! Than a larger table was seated next to us and got their drinks and orders before us! We have got served different food orders that weren't ours 7 times over the course of one meal! We had 2 waiters Johnny and some other guy with Gage's who were careless servers and no one here had a good positive vibe. It took an hour for a miso soup a seaweed salad and 4 rolls to come out when it wasn't even busy. We complained than we got our check which said the drinks were voided which was nice but than she reprinted another which voided $6 instead of $3 big whoop...Don't go here I don't recommend it!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place thanks to a coworker. Great vibe, great food and decent prices. I have o admit I don't do all you can eat, however the deal was too good to pass up. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Overall always a good experience.  I'm always ok with coming out here every time someone suggests even though I don't live near by.  They have a good selection that is diverse.  Service is nothing to write about but I'm always satisfied that they get everything to me in a timely fashion.  If there is anything I can  say about this place is that I'm a fan and would always want to come out here if it is suggested."}
{"text":"Not a bad place,  food is great. And staff is helpful and professional.  I will be returning to this place in the near future.  All you can eat, is the bomb,  and for not a bad price.  My first time here but it won't be my last."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect example of why I stopped going to AYCE sushi bars.  Lot's of our orders never showed up and the ones that did took forever. the Quality of the food  =   . I should have known better"}
{"text":"Love this place!  All you can eat sushi for $20, but they also have lunch specials on things like rice bowls and delicious salads!  I love that everything I eat there tastes fresh and finishes clean!    A high quality restuarant with a muted, classy feel to it :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Oyshi a couple times and have never left satisfied! The fish quality was not all that great, the rice was too wet for my taste & the service was quite slow! Also the stools at the sushi bar were being really weird and kept sinking down for some reason.. Maybe I'll give them another try..  MAYBE ! Haha"}
{"text":"I wish there were separate rating sections: Rolls were not as tight as they should/could be- very sloppy though taste was still outstanding and fresh. My waiter was great, attentive but not pushy nor lacking attention. However!!!!!! My biggest complaint is with the \"supervisor\" whom was conducting the business like the Soup Nazi from that Seinfeld episode.  Firstly, it wasn't busy at all, I have issues from the military and a long career working with criminals so I asked for a corner with a wall to my back. She immediately said \"can I put you at the table in the middle\".........wow!!!!!!!! Pull the sushi out of your ears and think about what I asked for. Then she proceeded to tell me once I was seated \"it's ok THIs TIME since we aren't that busy, normally it wouldn't be\"-  I told her frankly- \"well I'm a veteran with PTSD so thank you for the exception\"........ Waiter was great again btw!!!   I asked him if she was always that angry after she came in between me finishing my first round and waiting for round 2---- she asks \"are you ok? You don't have food\"........... now, I can see you might say she was just checking- but the way she did it, body language, tone of voice and previous interaction made me feel like I either had to have a constant stream of food coming, eating or I had to get out-   VERY UNENJOYABLE thanks to this lady!!!!!!  I always come to this location when in town, but now- I think I'll go to the one on Saraha-  much more relaxed atmosphere and don't have to feel rushed or like I can't relax and enjoy my"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch a handful of times just because it's nearby the office. The sushi is ok, but just ok. They tend to over-rice the nigiri and maki, which is my number one pet peeve at a la carte sushi places. It's not AYCE, I don't need to be tricked into consuming copious amounts of rice. The quality of the fish is pretty good and pretty flavourful in an ever-increasing world of bland, tasteless sushi. The service is really what sets this place apart. Friendly staff, attentive servers and fair price-lists keep this place full at lunch."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of the AYCE and westernized style sushi, you will really like this place.   1.  Service - 5 Stars - This place rocks with service. This is a key at the AYCE places as I think that they will automatically \"pace\" you with the limited staff and service. However, here, we had numerous people helping, providing us food, taking orders for additions and even the manager or owner (didn't get his name) came out to help.  Very, very nice.  2.  Ambiance - 5 Stars - I was kinda irritated as to why my pals were asking to meet way out here in the middle of where, and it was not a disappointment at all. The table set up is great, nice waiting area, very comfortable flow.  I felt very, very relaxed here and not rushed at all.....  3.  Food Quality - We ordered some real sushi like Amai Ebi with the fried shrimp heads and they were tasty. The Uni or sea Urchin was very flavorful and the texture was spot on.  Then, we had a bunch of westernized sushi that my pals ordered and while I cannot tell you what was in them and the conglomeration of sauces that hid the fish taste, I can tell you that as a food group, this stuff was pretty darn good. I wouldn't call it sushi, I would call it \"chop suey sushi\".  I give the food quality 4 stars.  4.  Pricing - For AYCE, the price is not bad 21 / 26 per person depending on lunch or dinner.  Many of my favorites don't qualify for AYCE, so I will be going back to clarify this as I did not pay this bill, and so I am not 100% positive. However, in reading the bill, the more traditional and higher quality stuff was not included.  I will check this as I may be wrong.  For now, I give this 4 star.  GK says, check it out!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my last few to go orders here. This used to be my go to neighborhood sushi spot but sadly I won't be visiting any more. The service is decent but the sushi is just not as delicious as it used to be. My last to go order, the rolls were very heavily overloaded with rice, over cooked rice, so much that both rolls were falling apart as soon as I opened the to go box. I'm a sushi addict and I know that some places that offer AYCE overload the rolls with rice to fill you up but it's very disappointing when you are paying al a carte prices at $30 for 2 rolls and you have to pull so much rice off it and still can't enjoy it. I order to go from other places like Sawa, Ojah, Goyemon and Kyara and have never had this problem with them. Also, the shrimp tempura was mushy, the tuna didn't taste fresh... I could go on and on. Sadly wouldn't recommend Oyshi, plenty of other places to eat at."}
{"text":"The sushi is good for an all you can eat. The atmosphere is surprisingly comfortable. Originally I was going to give this place 4 stars, but the extras like rib eye and green tea tiramisu bumped me up to 5. The sushi is not the best, but it's pretty good, all you can eat, and only $26... Excellent value"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and today the service was not so great! I had to remind our waiter that I had ordered something.  Food was good but ended being here for a little over 2 hours because  he always took long. Everyone else was great it was just our waiter. FYI I was upset because it wasn't that busy"}
{"text":"The best sushi and value in Las Vegas. I highly recommend if you love great sushi and good service."}
{"text":"Came for a quick dinner & was craving sushi. Got seated at the bar right away. Sushi Chefs & entire staff are very friendly. I noticed they have A LOT of Chefs & restaurant staff, which is very good. We ordered some wine & raspberry sake. I liked my raspberry sake. Very fruity. We ordered the Lobster Affair (very yummy & had crunch topping), Heart Attack (spicy & decadent) & Oh my heart rolls (tasty). We truly enjoyed our food so much. We were very happy! The food came out fairly quick (than most places). The décor was really nice & modern. Overall food was great & staff were A++. This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"This was meh. Nothing great about it. The rolls were so small and the fish wasn't that fresh. Service was okay.. The server was getting annoyed because I said I didn't like eel sauce..which was difficult because almost every roll they have is smothered in eel sauce. Not going back"}
{"text":"Very nice establishment kind of feels like you walking into a club to eat sushi about 30 bucks for the first 6 or so pages of the encyclopedia esque menu. They shout a loud Japanese greeting when you enter so be prepared to feel like Buddha himself with that welcoming there monster roll as well as the scallop crunch was delightful. Over all with a decent knowledge of where there fish come from and a menu that explodes off the menu  I might have found a new sushi stop here in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is our go to sushi place! We have never had a bad experience here and will never stop coming here. My favorite roll is the Kamikaze roll and my fiance loves the spicy rolls. And the best part is that they have a lot of apps that my daughter cab enjoy and she sure does. Also another favorite roll is the crazy Philly which is good and crunchy. The customer service is great and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a great sushi place, because this one is definitely one of the best! Thanks for everything!"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Never let's me down. Great service  Amazing sushi chefs  Looking forward to trying the Sahara location with my friend.   20% off lunch during happy hour 330-530pm"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, the sushi is frozen and not fresh, I asked kindly to replace the bad tuna for something else and they said I would have to pay for it, can't believe a place like this is still in business."}
{"text":"Sushi was okay. The rolls looked messy and the service not the best but our waitress was nice and helpful. The music was to loud and made having a conversation with my husband hard, not to mention we couldn't hear the wait staff. I would go again but not for dinner."}
{"text":"Love the all you can eat with a variety of options!! The staff is friendly, it's very comfortable, and I enjoy the atmosphere. The only flaw is I feel it took a long time for things to come out - but that meant I had time to digest in between rolls.. I really enjoyed the experience overall!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool! This is my second time and pretty impressed! The sushi was really good and creative and the sizzling meat dishes are off the hook! Nice vibe and for lunch the $10 special is way too much good stuff to eat!!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi! Very fast & friendly service. Good price for all you can eat. IMHO, too many rolls with cream cheese. However, I will return! :-)"}
{"text":"Bland tastebuds and strong stomachs: WELCOME.  I haven't had this place since the last time I got food poisoning.  But, after a good number of years, here I am. Again. With a stomach full of pain and a pocket less of money.  Waste of my time.  The service is ok.  But if the food was superb, I'd be ok with that.  The calamari tasted like batter and oil.  The sushi broke each time I picked it up.  The meat was subpar.  And everything in my insides hurt.  My girlfriend got instant diarrhea.  I'm holding myself together till I get home.  But I'm still waiting on our server to get back and pick up my check. It's been over 10 minutes.  Dislike!!!!  This place was a million times better when it first opened. Sad it's turned to this."}
{"text":"Yeah, the Husband and I are sushi snobs - at least we're upfront about it.  But when you're living in Vegas, the only way to go is to do AYCE, right?  After getting tons of recommendations for this place, we finally got around to seeing what the hype is all about.  All-you-can-eat dinner is $26/pp.  It was pretty busy on a Sunday night with a steady stream of customers (and large groups) coming in all night long.  Like Ned M. mentioned, the sushi rice is only okay...it could be better.  Perhaps that's what put us off already...we had to eat the rice and we weren't digging it.  We ordered lots of nigiri and found the fish to be okay too, some of it was mushy though.  As one friend mentioned, she wished the fish was a bit 'colder'.  Maybe we came on a bad night - but everyone is raving about the fish.  I'm also not too fond of 'sauce' added to my nigiri, and they added 'sauce' to a lot of my nigiri choices.    They do offer a wider selection of side items like Asian style skirt steak, ribeye steak teriyaki, etc.  And for this reason, one friend prefers coming here over other AYCE places.  I do like their version of agadashi tofu though.  Limitations on their menu include: * one order of uni and amaebi per person * limit one order of oysters on the half shell (4 pieces) per person * limit one order on desserts of creme brulee, mochi ice cream, berry parfait or green tea tiramisu (regular ice cream is AYCE though - plum, green tea, vanilla, and coffee)  Sitting at the sushi bar, service was pretty good.  The manager seemed like he was our main waiter and he was quite attentive.  We thought we were supposed to order our sushi from the sushi chef, but he asked the manager to take our sushi order instead.  He continued to take our orders throughout the night and refilled our beverages too.  There was a gap at one point where our tempura order was forgotten, had to be reordered again, and then had to be followed up on again before we got it.  I can see why this place is popular - there's definitely a mixed crowd and separate rooms for private parties.  The staff are busy and attentive and they definitely recognize the regulars.  They have a lot of rolls to choose from, something that we usually avoid.  Overall, we found Oyshi Sushi to be an average place for AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Oyshi sushi came highly recommended from a buddy of mine back in Hawaii. He said the next time you're in Las Vegas you need to check out this place and that \"I'll thank him later!\" This place did not disappoint! This is hands-down now my favorite place for sushi here in Las Vegas!  There are ample parking in the strip mall. This is a very nice restaurant outside and inside. The restaurant is very elegant, spacious, with high ceilings. This location appears to be a new building so everything if fresh, new, clean ....  They have a very impressive array of sushi roll selections from your basic sashimi and nigiri sushi to their hand rolls and \"signature\" hand rolls! If you love sushi, I highly recommend ordering their signature hand rolls and other hand rolls!! Most of these selections are very exotic and unique! Nice combination and mixing of ingredients! The hand rolls were my favorites here!  Service is exceptional! They kept coming to see how we were doing, as well as making sure our drinks were topped off or didn't run low.  The next time you're in Las Vegas, take a drive away from the strip for some really fine hand-crafted sushi!  Oh, and did I forget to mention? Its all you can see for about $35! Even better! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Okay so I've been to this location multiple times, before I had pretty bad service...however the new assistant manager was serving us this time and he was awesome. I believe he said he just got promoted to that position recently and it seems like whatever they are changing is working. The staff was super friendly and the kitchen was super fast! I went with my husband and 2 kids and we ordered all you can eat for us and for the kids we got chicken. At the end we ordered ice cream for all of us and he was so nice for no reason at all took the kids ice cream off the bill. I have absolutely not one complaint about the way they are running this restaurant and hope they continue to do so! We just had our 3rd kid and when I'm recovered we're definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Cheap under cooked rice, bad oysters, terrible service... This isnt sushi... So disappointed. Tried 3 times just bc i live so close but the food and service gets worse and worse."}
{"text":"Oh yeah! My new & ONLY Sushi spot! Bomb rolls and Sashimi, excellent and friendly Chefs! I will say the waits are crazy and if you better organize that part"}
{"text":"The sushi here was great! Really fresh. I do have another favorite sushi spot, so I do not treat myself to Oyshi as much as I'd like too, but the few times I do get over there, I definitely enjoy the rolls as well as the appetizers that are included in AYCE. I will say, that, like many AYCE sushi places, service is not the quickest. When ordering a roll, you may not get it for a while later. But it's understandable, as the place is busy. ' Overall, the sushi is pretty delicious."}
{"text":"LETS START OFF WITH ALL YOU CAN EAT FOR TWO HOURS!!!  Yes two hours for one of the cheapest all you can eat sushi I've seen in Las Vegas myself. Some will say that service of the sushi is a tad slow but hey you get two hours. Who likes to be rushed when eating anyways? I enjoy food so I would like to enjoy it at a nice pace thank you. If your with great company that gives some extra time for some intellectual exchange of words (conversation). Plus the two hours give enough time to let the rice settle a bit and enough time to try a good portion of the menu.  The service might be a tad slow but the workers are always pleasant. I actually feel like I'm wanted there.. not like that other Asian restaurants.. They also are very knowledgeable with the menu which leads to great sushi suggestions.  The sushi at Oyshi I say is the best I've had in Las Vegas!  I would like to suggest the RED ROCK ROLL due to the fact that it contains \"Orgasm Sauce.\"  The sauce is rightfully named this because it will climax your taste buds into ecstasy!  Conclusion.. YES!"}
{"text":"We thought we'd try this place instead of going to our usually sushi spot, what a mistake that was! The service is terrible, we had a server that was just wondering around like a lost puppy. Our waters were empty on several occasions and I had to ask twice how much longer it would be until we got our sushi and then was given the confused \"let me go check\" look. Also, we were told they only did half rolls at the bar, which makes no sense! The sushi was mediocre at best. In a town full of great places to eat, skip this one and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here for a bday dinner..and they sat us in our own private area on the side, which was perfect.  $25 for all you can eat and that pretty much included everything on the menu besides sashimi... They had many rolls to choose from and they also had yakitori dishes(bacon wrapped asparagus, steak, chicken, shrimp, scallops), poke salads(delicious), poke bowls, oysters, mussels.. There was a great selection.  Since we had a big party, our order took some time and some got missed but the servers were more than helpful and they made sure we got everything we wanted.  After our meals they also had parfait, mochi, and tiramisu for dessert..I would definitely be coming back..Only downer is that it is pretty far from the strip if you don't have a car, its about a $30 cab ride, but if you split it, its not so bad.  After 2 hours of stuffing our faces and many bottles of sake, we left stuffed and satisfied and it only came out to $40 a person! We were expecting way more!"}
{"text":"Snow Mountain roll is incredible! Service usually good though the wait for rolls can get long during dinner. Only complaint is the god awful music. Hip hop and EDM are all you hear. Nothing against Ludacris but he isn't really sushi music. This kills the atmosphere. Would come more often if they set a better music program."}
{"text":"Chirashi is good, but prettty limited on the quantity of fish,,,a few fillers.  Service at the bar was great, the guys are lively and keep a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing place and amazing food me and my husband were treated like it was our anniversary.  Chef Ed is super sweet."}
{"text":"Tucked into the base of a condo at the foot of Yonge Street, next to another fave haunt of mine (Harbour Sports Grille), this quaint little joint delivers good quality sushi with a smile and without fuss.  Private booths, decent selection, quietly efficient service, fast take-out and most importantly well-made sushi makes this place a solid option when Your Craw's Craving The Raw.  I repeat: there is nothing fancy going on here, but it's just good.  Which is better than Not Good or Bad, and given the absolute nightmare that are some Toronto sushi joints, I'm happy to recommend this place.  And specifically: go here after a summery late-evening walk around Harbourfront - because the restaurants around Harbourfront itself are super lame, full of loud American tourists in loud Hawaiian shirts and hard to get a good table at; this place is no more than a 10 minute walk away, less pretentious and less intent on raping your wallet within an inch of its life."}
{"text":"Love this spot. In terms of availability of diverse food items for AYCE sushi places this place is pretty great. Sitting at the bar the chefs are friendly, and the waitstaff has always been wonderful. Been going here for years and besides them not having a punch card for AYcE, the place is great and open late!"}
{"text":"Love the ayce order right off the menu to the chef at the bar. Been here several times and never disappointed. Not too expensive and great variety. Will be back"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy!  My friends and I came here one day for lunch while on a trip to Vegas for our friend's birthday.  We heard from our party planner about this place that has all you can eat sushi and we were there.  There were 9 of us and the service was quick and friendly, and we definitely stayed a few hours to milk the all you can eat deal for what it was worth! Sooooo good! Definitely go! Tons and tons of choices on the menu as well!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome here, always long waits to get in. My favorite sushi place in Vegas"}
{"text":"This place is better then what I expected. The service was good. The sushi is good with a lot of options to choose from. The red bean moochi is soo delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town for the AYCE price. Burger and Fries Roll, topped with steak and fried onions was particularly delicious, also not on the menu. Even if you're looking for a veggie roll, they've got you covered here. The surf and turf is small but served with a very good sesame sweet sauce, while the shrimp and steak are grilled to perfection. The tempura is very crunchy and it comes out very hot."}
{"text":"Great AYCE sushi :)   Pros: Fresh, good portions, large selection. Good dessert.    Cons: How far in on Rainbow it's located. Can be long waits-make RESERVATION! Lobster fair was not that great.  Fish without rice not option under AYCE."}
{"text":"Excellent quality sushi and very inexpensive. If you're looking for a good sushi place for lunch, try this place.  Service is very quick and inexpensive.  A lot of the hockey players who come to play in Toronto call this place a regular due to its proximity to the ACC.  Have never tried dinner here, only lunch."}
{"text":"Random nights with good friends are always a blast!  I've always said it.  Spontaneity really makes the activity better!  So when I was invited last minute for a sushi dinner, I knew it was going to be fun.  We settled on a place one of us raved about.  I've been to Soyo restaurant many times but never Oyshi.  Time to Yelp!  The only down side of this place is the location.  I live across town from here.  Oyshi is in a really cool strip mall in my opinion.  First, you have one of my favorite Korean joints.  Now you have my favorite fried rice joint, Rice Trax.  This location, although far, will be frequented a lot.  Although the wait was super long, the restaurant is pretty cool.  Love the concrete floors, the wood accents in the front and the half table chairs, half booth options for seating.  Our service was pretty good.  Multiple servers came by our table at most times.  It was enjoyable.   For dinner at a sushi joint in Vegas, the ONLY way to go is to get the AYCE special (All You Can Eat).  This place charges a $26 price tag.  The one thing that threw me for a loop were the rules involved.  I've never seen a place have all their rules listed on their menu.  With this dinner, you can literally order anything off the menu.  Granted, there are a few items that limit one per person, but you have access to everything.  My recommendations to get the most out of your AYCE is to stick to non-rice dishes.  I know, I know, it's a sushi joint, but trust me.  You can eat so much more if you stick to the protein.  For dinner, here's what I got, grouped in categories:  Things I loved: Seaweed Salad (with sesame seeds), Fresh Oysters (with ponzu sauce, green onions and hot sauce), Baked Mussels (topped with yum yum sauce and ponzu), Miso Soup (always a hit), Shrimp Tempura (lightly breaded), chicken yakitori (2 skewers with dark meat chicken and yakitori sauce),   Things I liked but kind of disappointed with: Ahi Poke - Bowl filled with seaweed salad, shredded cucumbers and onions on the top, was small chunks of tuna with a little sesame seeds.  Kind of a disappointment.  I understand that tuna is expensive, but the dish was 75% salad and 25% tuna, which should have been the star of the show.   Things that were questionable:  Yellowtail or hamachi nigiri - If there's any rice dish I get, it's nigiri because of the small portions. The yellowtail is usually my favorite fish, however, this specific yellowtail was a little discolored and questionable to me.  I took a bite and ended up finishing the dish but it didn't taste like what I'm used to.  Make sure it's fresh!  All in all, this place is actually good.  I'm definitely coming back for another AYCE session.  The place is still convenient and the staff is nice.  If you're looking for a good sushi joint on the SW side of Vegas, for sure check them out!"}
{"text":"Favorite Location even though I live closer to the location. Great fast service! With Awesome friendly staff! Last but But Not Least the Best Sushi Ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night about 8:30pm.  Tried to go to Sushi Goymon first but there was a 2 hour wait, so decided to venture over to Oyshi Sushi.    When we arrived the place was half full, but still seemed overwhelmed, dirty dishes piled on empty tables with hostess clearing tables, waited about 5 minutes before she was able to seat us.  Not a big problem, but should've taken it as a sign of things to come.    We ordered some hot tea which came luke warm which got us off to a bad start.  The sushi, dragon rolls, caterpillar roll, tuna, were all fine, but took about 20 minutes to arrive.  We also ordered salads which came AFTER yes after the sushi about 30 minutes later.  When I mentioned this to the waiter, he simply said that we have two different kitchens and we bring things when they are ready.    Overall, it sushi was ok, probably 3 stars, but service was lacking so minus a star.  Probably would not go back."}
{"text":"The service is absolutely terrible and the wait time is reallllllly inconvenient because the staff are so unorganized. I literally walked in and waited at the podium for 15 minutes, and servers were just staring at me and I was like HELLO WILL ANYONE HELP ME? There was also tons of tables like 10+ and they still made me wait 30 minutes... for what?! The staff were just chatting, hiding behind the podium right by the kitchen. They also don't take reservations at the weirdest times. The hostesses are sooooo rude here and will ignore you unless you ask them for an update.  The staff spent more time cleaning the tables while there. There were probably 30 people waiting outside, because when I was seated there was 5 empty tables around me! The rolls are just okay, but their fish/sashimi was good, even though the servers DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE???? How do you confuse a white fish with octopus ?! Their prices for AYCE are pretty standard, not too cheap or expensive. The quality of the food is pretty good.  The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous of course and very roomy. They also have an incredible sake selection ranging from hot-cold, fruity-to house."}
{"text":"Chef Ed was so sexy and funny! He made sure my service was prefect! Chef Ed provided us with amazing recommendations! He was definitely fun to talk with."}
{"text":"Bad food, rude server, dishonest practice. Most rolls taste the same as they covered everything with mayo. Oysters are sandy and not fresh, menu says you can order 2 per person but our party was restricted to one by the server. Only about 75% of the food we order showed up. The service was bad, waiting for water refill is at lease 30 mins. The worst of all, original check showed up on our table did not have 18% tips, but they charged on the credit card. When you sign the credit card slip, the slip says \"pre tip\" and asking you to tip again. I don't think anyone is managing the place as the busboy drop the dirty dish box on the floor, kicking the box across the dinning area. The wall painting was not family friendly. A man initiating sex to a woman who's butt is hanging out."}
{"text":"The wait was a little long when it appeared that there was many open tables. The service was friendly and fast.   The sushi was amazing, and the all you can eat was such s value!!  I highly recommend this place, and I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite AYCE sushi hot spots in town. The food is affordable and delicious. I recommend starting off your meal with the surf&turf, tempura shrimp and the special albacore toro with truffle sauce. For rolls my favorites are the heart attack, Japanese lasagna and the rainbow roll."}
{"text":"Ah, yes. The \"newer\" Oyshi. Essentially the same restaurant, but bigger--yet, somehow, not -quite- as tasty as the original location!   Ambiance: 4 - The epitome of comfort: Tables that are far away from each other, enough to spread out your leg and arm span so that you won't hit another person. But still, not far away enough that you can't hear the conversations of the table next to you!   Spacious with more tables and semi-dimly lit, this Oyshi seems to have a bit more romantic lighting, if you will. Don't worry! You can still see your menu!!   Service: 5 - Our table service was fast, friendly, attentive. The restaurant wasn't busy at all, so they were really able to cater!   Food: 3 - Just like their other location, they also offer AYCE and the choice of one of their specialty desserts!   I'm usually a huge fan of their food, but the quality of the rolls were just not as good as the original location! When the taste is up to speed, most likely I'll go back, but for now, I'll drive the longer drive to the first location.  However, if you do like this location and are looking for a roll to try, I recommend the Love Affair & the dessert is -always- worth a try! Also, if you like fresh oyster, theirs is delicious :)"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Oyshi, ever since it opened years ago, I've been a huge fan! It was the first AYCE sushi place I had ever been to. And after all this time, they still serve up pretty yummy eats!  AMBIANCE: 3 - The space is intimate, but at the same time, still pretty well lit. Usually has a good amount of people inside, I recommend calling in advance, especially with a big party.  SERVICE: 4 - Service is okay, especially when you call in a big party reservation; everything came out fast and hot for our bday party celebration! It's also pretty fast seated at the bar.  when you're not at the \"party tables\", regular service is a bit slow! I really hope they get better, but it's been that way for a while. Also, they charged full price for a kid under 10! Say whaa?!   FOOD: 4 - I have a like/love relationship with the food. So I'll just tell you my absolute favorite dishes to order: Love Affair, Fresh Oysters, Baked Mussels, Japanese Lasagna Roll, Vegas Roll, Garlic Tuna nigiri, Oyshi Roll, Strawberry Mochi, Green Tea Ice Cream, and the Ahi Poke :) All delish and some of the best sushi around. Though, not a huge fan of all of the nigiri that they serve.  Oyshi is always a fun time for me, so I hope that everyone that has a big reservation or sits at the bar feels the same way as well!"}
{"text":"Not a sushi eater but love love the chicken teriyaki the service and atmosphere is just right, server was on top of her game for a gathering of 11 people awesome service."}
{"text":"Went here for the AYCE Sushi, and it was simply BOMB.COM.  End of story.   Ok, I'll tell you more. They have more than just sushi on the menu - great steak, delicious fresh oysters, and best of all GREAT SERVICE!! They didn't rush us, the sushi came out in a timely manner, but not all at once so we didn't get overwhelmed.  Did I mention the amazing service?? Cause it really was! I swear with all of the AYCE sushi places around Vegas, the menu doesn't vary too much, so the service really will determine if I come back to a place or not.   And I will be BACK!! Thanks for a great experience, and obviously a full tummy :)"}
{"text":"I found this place perusing Yelp sometime back in 2010. AYCE lunch $21, dinner $26 which is comparable to similar places. Ive come here about 2-3 times a month for the past 2yrs plus. Always do AYCE. The main thing that got me as a repeat customer is their service(at least in my experiences) is considerably better than most sushi places Ive visited. I counted and cant even believe Ive tried 12 different AYCE sushi spots in Vegas to date. Im not a big fan of the traditional sushi, more into the creative and many rolls that these places sell. I like to say Im more into the 'americanized' type of sushi and have been able to convince friends who dont even eat raw fish to try it with me and most liked it. So you can take what you want from my review based on that. This place does get very busy at dinner with sometimes long waits to be seated so I try to frequent at lunch. Service can take longer at times. I typically like to sit at the bar when I sushi. I have experienced faster service that way usually, so now I lean towards sitting at the bar. The ambiance, decor and music targets the more younger demographic. Some items I favor are the seared salmon nigiri, cajun albacore nigiri, tiger roll, double screaming orgasm, heart attack, ian special, chung hua, kamikaze & surf n turf roll. At every AYCE I go for green tea ice cream and hamachi kama(not on AYCE here) if its available. They do also have brulees, mochi ice cream and parfaits for dessert. All desserts are limited to 1 per cept for ice cream. Dinner AYCE limits are 1 uni, 1 ama ebi and 2 raw oysters which is similar to most AYCEs. Theres a list of appetizers which I will order from ocassionally but I concentrate more on the sushi and green tea ice cream. :) Is it the freshest and highest quality seafood? No. Its decent. It does say theres a time limit of, 90min I believe? Dont remember exactly atm since its never come into play. Ive never been rushed even tho I know I have passed the time limit before, or things like being reminded repeatedly on leftover charges. I realize this may not be everybodys cup of tea but for food and service Ive gotten here, I think you definitely get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"I have been a regular between both locations for over 4yrs now and bring everyone i know who craves sushi here. Came to the Sahara location tonight with some friends visiting from Hawaii. One of them dropped their $1k casino chip on the ground. He didnt even realize it until i got a call later from Kevin, the manager, saying one of his workers turned it in to him. Thats just the great type of people who work here. Another good reason to come to Oyshi. Not that i needed it lol. But our visit tonight is definitely worth mentioning."}
{"text":"Always come here for the lunch specials. Staff is always friendly and attentive.  Will be back here again soon I'm sure lol"}
{"text":"Why so fancy?!  So my wife and I were driving one day, trying to figure out how we can top off our empty stomachs when we saw this gem from the streets. Located in a plaza on Sahara off of Teneya, this spot had a clean look to it. Plenty of parking. Walked inside and almost felt as if I was under dressed. This place is Fancy. Greeted as we entered, we were shown to our table in record timing. Well, for a sushi restaurant. Very spacious, great modern decor, and plenty of seating. Well lit, with just the right amount of volume on the music.   Our server was great and gave us the full run through of the menu and drinks. No empty glasses here baby. Food came as fast as we ordered them. Well, at least from what I remember. Here's the rundown of what we ordered.  What ordered: Miso soup Ahi poke Calamari Baked mussel  Shrimp tempura Sizzling beef Beef asparagus   Nigiri: Tuna  Garlic Tuna Salmon Albacore Garlic albacore Yellowtail Ikura Uzura - quail egg Masago - smelt egg Tamago - sweet egg  Know what? We cleaned our plates. Yes we did. The fish is fresh. A bit light on flavor for the mussels, but amazing taste for the sizzling beef. Since I'm accessing long term memory and my   hippocampus isn't cooperating, I'll have to keep it short. (Note to self, write review within a week of visiting business).  This place is well worth the drive. Perfect for that elegant date, without the outrageous prices and AYCE bustle. We shall see you again FANCY!"}
{"text":"Oyshi is the best, have never had something I didn't like - they have something for everyone"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi - terribly slow service, every time. Most of the time when we go, there are maybe 2-3 tables of people and yet the service is the slowest service of any restaurant I have ever been to. There are always many staff members walking around, looking busy, so they don't seem understaffed. Had this same problem at the other location, too, so it must be a training thing.We will continue to go back, because the sushi is delicious, but I wouldn't suggest coming here if you have an appointment or need to be somewhere on time. Even getting our waters refilled is almost impossible. We're going to attempt carry out here tonight - we'll see how that goes!"}
{"text":"Arrived last meeting my friends at this sushi place. So the waiter didn't realize that I got there and sat for awhile talking to my friends. Once the waiter got there, he was pleasant and attended to the table. Fresh selection of fish and very creative rolls. I would dine there again."}
{"text":"It was a great place to eat. It was really quiet and nice on the inside. The sushi rolls were satisfying and they have better appetizer selections than most places I've ever been to eat sushi. The waiter was very prompt and nice. She really knew the menu very well and she was patient. You know how some waiters/waitresses can be when it's your first time at their establishment? They can be seemingly impatient and rude because they want you to hurry up and order. Not this place. She knew it was our first time, so she suggested awesome rolls and gave us plenty of time to figure out what we wanted. No rush. I would suggest going on a weekday. Some All you can eat sushi places have a timer set in place for how long you can sit there and enjoy your food."}
{"text":"Before you step into this restaurant, think again. There is a great five star restaurant next to it call soyo, you sure you wanna eat here?? Granted its a different type of restaurant but still, its money well spent if you spend $ 50 for two in soyo than here.  The reason why I am so harsh on this place. Well, sushi are just amazingly stupid. There is no artform whatsoever, sushi are art, even though you are an ayce restaurant. Its a reflection of the sushi chef how the presentation of the sushi went.   This restaurant make all sushi look like california roll and to boot if you look at all the rolls it full of slimy crabmeat with mayonaisse combination to make you full right away.   Sure, they do have other appetisers on the menu or dessert included, but there are lots of other japanese ayce around las vegas that offer the same things.   All this yelper that commented how great this restaurant is must never really eat in a proper japanese restaurant. Service are ok but honestly this one is a one and done for me.  You can try and then pm me afterward, I will probably just say \"see I told you so\""}
{"text":"Wow! The service and wait time is extremely slow tonight. So slow that I'm on my phone more than ever at a sit-down dinner. It's so slow that I have the time to check-in here on yelp and write this long review. As I'm writing this it has been 10 since my last order came out.  In between orders we've had our coke refilled like 3 times. I'm waiting for the last order to come out. I'm not even full... At this point I just want to leave."}
{"text":"Consistently consistent!  I have been coming here for at least 3 years now and still continue to bring out of town guests here.  We have had wonderful service whether we were dining for two or a table of 14.  Some of my local friends, who moved out of town still request Oyshi for their sushi cravings.    Now onto the food.  For $26 (dinner) AYCE, you get beyond your money's worth.  The menu offers a variety of appetizers, rolls, nigiri, and dessert. (Of course, sashimi is NOT included).  Some of my favorites include: Appetizers: oysters, mussels, rib eye, surf & turf, dynamite Rolls: Ian special, double screaming & love affair Nigiri: SUPER WHITE TUNA!, hamachi (yellowtail) & salmon Dessert: creme brule & green tea ice cream parfait.  The overall restaurant has a great vibe, good energy/music, and attentive staff.  The last time we went here was a table of 14 and all of orders came out correct and in a timely manner.  Our server's name was Pink and she took wonderful care of us!"}
{"text":"Oyshi has been my favorite since I first went ! Love it's AYCE and sit at the bar with Chef Ed!! He is the best ! (:"}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 35/100***  I have been to this location about 4 times total, service was never really extraordinary but it wasn't quite as disorganized as it was last Saturday. They had us sit in a private area because we were a party of 15, and I don't know if it was due to that fact but the total experience was dampen by their lack of organization when it came to ordering and getting our food.   We all got the AYCE, so that right there was already less of a headache or so I thought. We even helped out by writing our orders on the napkins. That part was a cinch but when it came to actually receiving our orders, it was a mess. First, the dishes came out one at a time and then later on we were told that they were putting orders together in one plate: the tempura for example, which had we known, wouldn't have been a problem and could've just passed it around. Instead, people were waiting for their orders to arrive only to find out it was already given to the end of the table. We didn't want to keep ordering as we weren't aware if they were just backed up or totally forgotten. We were finally told towards the middle of the meal what they were doing, when half of the party was agitated already. Don't mess with hungry Filipinos LOL.     The food is just OK, quality is nowhere as good as some of our preferred sushi places, it's AYCE I know, but I've been to other AYCE places where their nigiri's taste so much better and fresher. Now their green tea crème brulee is in a league of its own, I could eat about 5 of those suckers lol, it might be the only reason for me to come back hahaha oh and the unlimited ice cream."}
{"text":"Wonderful Sushi!!! Did not expect to find this in the desert!! All the fish was fresh and oh so good!!!! Wish I took pics of all the food!! I had my sushi craving filled!!!!"}
{"text":"Simply the BEST!!...there fast & customer service rocks!!...would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Its not Nobu. Its not Yellowtail.  It does not compare to the top quality sushi I get back in Hawaii BUT you can have an entire meal for the price of just two pieces of sushi at the other places.    $21 for lunch.  $26 for dinner.  All you can eat (with some exclusions).  The food is good and well seasoned.  Fish is reasonably fresh.  Rolls are creative and good eats.  Excellent interpretation of classic sushi dishes.  The ambiance is a little weird (nightclub meets strip mall Japanese sushi joint) but who cares.  The food and service are good and the price is right."}
{"text":"Competition in the Las Vegas AYCE (All You Can Eat) scene is fierce, one of the most recent causalities is Sushi On Rainbow on the Westside of Chinatown.  It's somewhat hard to standout in such a crowded field.  Generally, I like to categorize them in which part of town they are in.  One of my \"must go\" places have been added in the Southwest section in Las Vegas.  Oyshi Sushi won't have the premium quality sushi, expect the fish to be previously frozen but still is not bad, the rice to fish ratio is more fish than rice, the rolls are not too over sauced, the salmon roe and flying fish eggs to be plentiful.  Customer service is excellent and attentive, they will stop by frequently to check if you want more orders.  Several notes:  They charge for green tea, so don't be surprised to tacked on a few more dollars for this.  The prices are in line with other AYCE restaurants, just a few dollars above $20 for lunch and around $26 for dinner.  Pass on the green tea creme brulee and green tea ice cream, barely any hints of green tea at all."}
{"text":"Another AYCE sushi joint in Vegas.  I swear there are one in every two blocks.  Bigger than most, this place is usually busy at night but very chill during earlier hours like  most places.  But when it's busy, it's really busy which leads to service sucking!  But overall the atmosphere inside is pretty good and seats up large group of people which is good for birthday dinners or just a bunch of friends coming from out of town.  All you can eat I believe was $25 for dinner.  I'm just gonna point out what I like and usually order. Baked mussels, dynamite roll, volcano roll, nigiri is not as tasty here, oysters are the best I've had in Vegas but unfortunately only 4 per person so get your friends to order it as well even if they don't eat it so you can have it, surf and turf (highly recommended), and for dessert the fruit parfait.   This is not a quiet place for dinner so bad idea for a date if you plan on having a meal with a quiet conversation.  People come here often with their kids and big groups of people, which shouldn't surprise you are very loud.  This place is a hit or miss but fortunately I'm patient when it comes to bad service when it's excusable because of how busy this place can be at times."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I must say, I like it here. We usually get the AYCE. The menu has a good variety and includes dessert. The sushi is decent to good. There's a board with specials as well so don't forget to check that out.   Oyshi offers the usual Japanese fare from sushi to specialty rolls, appetizers and other small plates. Some of the sushi have options of preparing. ie. you can have your albacore regular, seared, seared with garlic, etc. Same goes for the salmon and yellowtail and a few other fish on the menu.   I really like the yakitori, baked mussels, sushi options and desserts.   This location is way off the strip. It's worth a try if you like AYCE. They also accept reservations."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Subpar service and rubbery old fish that smells. Had AYCE and only had 2 orders worth a total of 10 bucks but STILL charged 23 dollars cause all they can do is give me a 20 percent discount. Manager wasn't even present so I had them call her. Her excuse was that it was busy and almost closing. That should not be an excuse and it is a piss poor excuse at that. We were there 2 hours before closing. They had us WAIT about 30 mins before they were able to get back to us. AVOID THIS PLACE and you have been warned."}
{"text":"What can I say? All-you-can-eat sushi is always awesome! The plus is its all-you-can-eat sushi PLUS all-you-can-eat appetizers like kobe beef, tempura, oysters, mussels, etc.  Also you can have a choice of 1 out of 4 mini desserts.  After an all-you-can-eat fest one night here at Oyshi, my friends and I left full and very happy. :D"}
{"text":"I brought my mom to eat sushi, since we both love it. We did our usual order of all you can eat. They start you off with an appetizer then your rolls. After 30 minutes of waiting, only 1 of the 2 appetizers and 3 of the 4 rolls we ordered arrived. We ate everything quickly since we were hungry and wanted to order more rolls. For the second order, we asked for 4 more rolls and again, only 3 of the 4 came to the table. We kept asking, when are the other rolls and appetizer coming? All they said was \"well let them know\". Finally, dessert time came and they were all out of everything green tea, so we settled for a strawberry mochi instead. We left without getting our appetizer and 2 of our rolls. I still paid $28 each. Wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"This place has been solid in the past- since all the new managers have come in the service is not as good- food still remains above average."}
{"text":"Went to dinner there tonight with another couple. Sushi was mediocre. Service was horrible! Server accidentally spilled water on the table ended up in my lap and my husbands. The server was in no rush to clean it up. Water was everywhere. He uttered an \"sorry about that\" then ignored our table after that. Never came back to check on us. Brought the check to us- Sat it on the table and then said \"do u want dessert?\" I would think that after knocking water all over the table, which resulted in water all over my husbands pants. He would of been sincere about his apology. Maybe even offered a free mochi?  Prior to that, I had to ask THREE times for napkins while we were eating. Previous expierence there has been great! The four of us, Will never return."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Vegas! $21 All you can eat lunch, $26 dinner. Clean restaurant with cordial staff.  They offer more rolls that any spot I've been and the quality of fish is top notch."}
{"text":"I really liked it here, but I came today with my brother and sister in law. HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE. The amaebi was literally spoiled and the oysters cannot even be classified as oysters. I understand if the food is not good, it is not the servers' fault. But lack of service when the place is not really busy is their own thing. My sister in law's soda glass was literally empty for a good 15 minutes. No servers are walking around, checking on us. We had to practically beg for the attention of the servers. We feel sick due to the food, but the service was just literally lagging. I will not come again. Sorry, Oyshi."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my experience here!  I was reading the other reviews that had bad ratings and most of it came from bad service and about waiting too long. Well first of all, you gotta come early! You can't just be walkin in like you own the place. If it's busy don't expect to be waited on hand a foot. C'mon give these guys a break! They do their best to accommodate the guest they have. I mean, would you be able to handle 6-8 parties yourself? (Unless you're and server than ok. Haha) But nonetheless, they continuously checked up on us and I think that's all we can ask for.   I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. Besides the outstanding service, if you love sushi, Just come here. It's sooo good and During lunch too cause it's cheaper! Hahah Enjoy!"}
{"text":"4 words: All you can eat. That's the way to go. Being that I'm not from here, I was surprised at how fresh the sushi was. But it was! We ordered way too much but somehow found a way to finish it all. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The 5 star is for our server. She was really really nice and patient when we didn't know what to order. She did recommend some rolls and they were good. Would definitely come back but maybe with a bigger group so we can taste more rolls. The food was good I did have my very first raw sushi roll which I'm proud of all thanks to our server :)"}
{"text":"Went here last night. The food was pretty good, and the atmosphere was great. I do wish they would update the menu because there are things listed that they no longer serve. Only other complaint would be for them to be a little more attentive. My friend didn't get the rolls that she ordered while everyone else had food so we had to ask for them again and then it took forever for our checks to be picked up and cleared out."}
{"text":"I used to HATE this place!  Many visits a couple years ago...all with slow service, room temperature nigiri, etc.  This was actually one of the only places that I told people NOT to go to for sushi....and never understood why others liked it so much.  A VERY reluctant lunch stop proved to be a much better experience this time around!  A few highlights :  Sea Scallops were awesome! Super fresh, buttery texture...melt in your mouth!   Sake was very fresh today! Beautiful cuts of salmon....the Sake in Yuzu was very good as well, and not overpowering like yuzu can be sometimes.  The Ika with Mint. I really enjoyed this combination...and it was noticeably less chewy than most.   Ahi. Fresh, but another odd cut...the darker area was a bit tougher...should have been removed by the chef.  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oyshi-sushi-las-vegas?select=UnVcwLiUog_Lmr-ZkUaKwQ#UnVcwLiUog_Lmr-ZkUaKwQ  Unagi. Nice crispy edges...good flavor!   Ahi Poke. Tuna was fresh, and the seaweed salad was good too!  Sunomono. I liked their version here...thin cuts versus the larger circular cuts most use. The ginger sauce was good too.  Green Tea Creme Brulee. Delicious! Lots of tea flavor here   Service was fairly quick, considering their tables were mostly full.  I would come back again now if I was already on this side of town :P"}
{"text":"Kenny Lee was a very good and friendly server, made the experience great. Hope you get him as your server!!"}
{"text":"Tried the AYCE for lunch. Hated that they put so much imitation krab mix in almost every roll. Gross."}
{"text":"I love this place! Our food was so good and the service was great!!! Will definitely continue to dine here!"}
{"text":"Sigh. We were *really* looking forward to this after all the stellar reviews. I've been to Vegas many times and always thought the best sushi would be at some swank place on The Strip, but Yelp claimed otherwise.  The good: The food was, overall, fine. We didn't do All You Can Eat because my wife wanted two orders of sashimi (salmon and hamachi). Both were excellent. Nice large meaty pieces, well trimmed, nicely presented. We had two rolls each, which were fine but nothing special. I also had two orders of nigiri.  The bad: We arrived around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was MAYBE half full. It more than half hour before our first piece of food came out. It was 40 minutes before I saw any of my order. The (nice) server came by at 30 minutes and offered us free miso soup to help pass the time. Meanwhile we watched every other table in the place get multiple orders of sushi delivered. Completely unimpressed, and cost them several stars.  Other issues: I asked if they had aji bones they could deep fry, and the server went off to find out but never came back to tell me yes or no. My aji nigiri had the tiniest pieces of aji I've ever eaten on top. It tasted fine, but they amounted to table scraps, not at all like the beautiful pieces of sashimi my wife got."}
{"text":"Who ever was my sushi chef tonight didn't really do a great job on my shrimp tempura roll.  It was soggy and the crunch wasn't there.  I ordered two in case maybe there was a mistake on how it was made the first time.  The second was as soggy, if not, more.  The flavor was there, just the texture was not correct.  I normally come here with my cousins when we feel like sushi and in the past the sushi has always been top notch.  But tonight, I think the chef was probably in a bad mood, hence the mediocre sushi.   I also ordered a sashimi salad.  It's also not so great here.  I've had it better in other restaurants.  Oh well, maybe next time I try it might be better.  As long as the sushi chef I had tonight isn't the same as the next time."}
{"text":"Not bad but there's many better options.   The good: All the rolls we ordered were good and average price. The menu has a variety. The manager is present and checks on tables. The place is clean. Fish didn't taste like imitation but the rice wasn't great. The server and manager were friendly. They do let you customize a little (they took off the wasabi mango sauce for us).   The bad: Service was very slow. It was a Saturday afternoon and it wasnt packed...maybe short staffed?? The waitress may have been new (not sure). The manager did come over but it was hard to get his attention and our servers attention when we wanted to order. We had all you can eat ($27) and got about 5 rolls between the two of us plus two appetizers. The pink plastic flower stickers cheapen the decor. Seats were really uncomfortable!!"}
{"text":"Why three stars? Here's why.... First let me say that for a not so busy Saturday afternoon it took fifteen minutes for me and my boyfriend to be seated. It took another fifteen minutes on top of that for the waitress to take our order and another twenty minutes for us to get our sushi. I have heard of oyshi being one of the best sushi places in town, and while the sushi is good and tasty, in order for a restaurant (in my opinion) to have five worthy deserving stars the service needs to be as good as the food. That's minus star number one.   And!.... You would think for an 'all you can eat' everything in the all you can eat section is all you can eat, right? Including the dessert? Well, I think not (not here at oyshi at least.) The dessert here is one per person only. Which technically isn't all you can eat. So it's basically all you can eat sushi, but not dessert. Haha. That would minus star number two.   Now, on to the three yummy stars! When the sushi finally came, it was yum-O! With a capital last letter screaming O! The cajun albacore (thanks to a friend who recommended it at another sushi place) has become one of my favorites next to unagi. It's really full of flavor and I love how the center of attention goes to the fish, not the rice at the bottom. That gives plus one star.  The atmosphere in this restaurant is laid back. Both my boyfriend and I are laid back so the mood of the place set the mood for a relaxing time which is always much needed after a long busy week. Even their cutesy plate mats had designs of cutesy fonts and cutesy flowers. Haha. Guess what? Yes! You guessed it, another star for oyshi.  Freshness in sushi is another thing I look for. And boy oh boy does oyshi serve it fresh. As fresh as the prince of bel-air. We had the 'love affair' which everyone kept yelping about. It's the kind of affair that makes you feel guilty because you think you are cheating on your significant other. Oh yea, it's that's good! Total of three stars for this modern looking sushi spot.  I don't know if I'd come back though partly because of the service and partly because of my ever so longing for eating a lot of desserts. Well, I wouldn't say I don't know but maybe. Maybe the service is better than what we experienced in a different time or day. Maybe. A-ok review by me, but read other peoples reviews of this place. You may have a change of heart unlike me. =P"}
{"text":"Very nice and spacious compared to rainbow location. Ok so here i go with the review. Its exactly what you expect from the other location unfortunately. I'm just really surprised that by now they would have their Sh*t together. So when you order your dishes here you would think you get them in the order you order them but you don't. they would even try to rush you when you eat here because theres so much staff everyone takes your order."}
{"text":"When pressed for their favorite AYCE sushi place, most Vegas locals can name at least one. Oyshi on Rainbow is mine.   I've been here for lunch and dinner, by myself and on dates. Most often, my roommates and I just roll up after one of us so much as mentions sushi.  The food is delicious and extremely fresh. I'm from New York where all-you-can-eat sushi is unheard of--and would be pretty suss if you did hear of it. Less than $30 for seafood? What, was it fished out of Hudson River?  Sashimi platters are the only thing on the menu that isn't AYCE. Dessert, however, is. I highly recommend their chocolate creme brûlée! For apps, you must try their Ahi Poke.  I'm partial to their Shrimp Tempura hand rolls, which I can, and have, eaten 3-4 of in one sitting. Other favorites include: Kami-Kaze, Oh My Heart, and Lobster Fair. If you like nigiri, you should check the chalkboard when you come in for the daily specials.   Pro Tip: If you sit at the bar, you can order half-rolls! It's a great way to try more rolls if you're like me and have limited tummy space, but eyes bigger than your stomach."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night for a Bday.  We had a big group but we were very well accommodated.   The restaurant was very busy but the service was able to handle it.  Our drinks and food are coming out without us having to wait and it was very enjoyable.  I really enjoyed a couple of the rolls and the Uni.  The uni is very well priced at $6 for two pieces which is a little low compared to other sushi bars.   I recommend this place to all sushi lovers...   sorry no pics, I didn't think about it til the food was gone."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing. I was a little nervous going to a place that does all you can eat sushi, but wow it was great!  You could order anything you wanted except sashimi. Big rolls and cuts of fresh fish. Yes I stuffed myself to the gills with some of the best creative rolls I've ever seen, and walked out of that place with a $52 bill for 2 people. When income back to Vegas I will run to this place!!"}
{"text":"Sushi bar awesome... Rolls come fast taste great and you can order half rolls... But you do have to flag them down for your drink refills... But worth the yummy roll o my heart is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Ordered 6 plates and enjoyed everything. Ordered 3 more and was thoroughly satisfied. The \"sexy\" is very delicious. The \"heart attack\" is good if you love spicy. Japanese lasagna is always a tasty selection. If you want tangy mustard go for the  \"high roller\". The service was quick at first then slowed down mid way. Gave us time to chat with the party and food to settle.  27 an adult for AYCE at the time we went. Excellent place."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite ayce sushi. Their menu is very large. Everything we ordered was amazing. Waiters were very fast and friendly. Best service in vegas. I have been to many ayce sushi in vegas and this place is the best by far!! Already my 2nd time here within a week."}
{"text":"This place isn't my favorite sushi establishment.  The food isn't presented well, and my server is never around. I've been to the location on Sahara, and also this one on Rainbow. Didn't like the sushi quality or how the rolls were made. Table was sticky, which I didn't like. It made my dining experience uncomfortable.  Pros: AYCE is decently priced Short wait time to be seated Parking is easy to find Dessert was delicious Half order rolls, and hand cut options available  Cons: Tables are small Tables are sticky Service takes a long time after placing orders Seafood quality is below good Imitation crab is used Charged for extra for leftovers Music is outdated No wifi  Overall: I not fond of this sushi spot. The food is decent although the service lacked and so did the cleanliness of the establish at both locations. Bang for your buck isn't too satisfying. The dessert was good! Best part of the meal. 2/5 stars on my rating scale."}
{"text":"Sounded good, looked good, good to know there's an all-you-can-eat sushi option nearby. Went in and sat down, then noticed they're playing some pretty inappropriate music complete with explicit lyrics... not trying to sit through that while I eat. Sorry, had to get up and leave. Thanks anyway!"}
{"text":"I would have to agree with the other reviewers that this place is really decent. I am not a raw fish fan, so AYCE was used up on a lot of cooked items that were all fantastic. The service was extremely friendly from our initial greeting to our exit. The location is very large with a modern appeal, and very clean.  The server was a very friendly and provided great service -- I think her name was Jamee..."}
{"text":"I came here with 3 of my friends and we all got the AYCE sushi.  This was my first time trying sushi and I really enjoyed it.  The atmosphere was great, decent background music.  My friends had been there numerous time before so the did all the ordering. Our waiter was very friendly and the service was prompt.  I loved the \" Love Affair\" it was delicious.  I will definitely be returning to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I come here a lot with bae. I love it. Monster roll is really good.  They also give free beer if you review on yelp!"}
{"text":"Nice all you can eat menu...watch out for the Oysters not so good at room temp!!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love Oyshi sushi! We would come here every meal of every day if we had the money to spend. They have amazing appetizers from calamari to scallops to fresh oysters. My favorite roll is the lobster fair! And everything is such high quality. All the nigiri is amazing especially the Cajun and garlic albacore. The fish isn't fishy and the rice doesn't taste like vinegar like some lower quality places! The music is always so good it's usually like a mix between 90s and current R and B and hip hop music. All the staff is so great as well, we've never had a bad experience. Definitely our favorite place in town."}
{"text":"So good! Great service from Kenny.  AYCE is so worth it just try all the rolls first so you have room for all of them.  Come in before 6 pm to avoid the crowd :).  Green tea tiramisu is pretty good."}
{"text":"Went again yesterday with a group of 7. It seems as if the service gets worse, which is a shame because the food is still great. After we placed our first orders, it took almost 25 minutes for the first items to come out. Again, this waiter forgot a handful of our items and we had to remind him multiple times. One of my friends was really upset because he ordered 5 things from the menu in the beginning and it took 45 minutes for them to bring out just one! Like I said, the food was still great but having to wait what seems forever for your plates ruins the whole experience. They state you have a 2 hour limit, but what's the point if you are waiting for your food for more than half that time?  On a plus side, they did add new items to their AYCE menu; more rolls, salads, and rice bowls. I tried most of the new rolls and they were fantastic!  This isn't a go-to place for me  anymore but it will be if the services quality catches up to the food on my next couple of visits."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's so close to my house too which is a plus. I always get shrimp tempura rolls at sushi restaurants, and here they have a whole shrimp tempura roll section on the menu, with different toppings, sauces, meats, etc. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love Oyshi. The fish taste fresh and they have a great menu! Good service, just don't expect to get a table without a reservation most nights of the week. It will be about an hour wait."}
{"text":"Didn't get a chance to eat here but felt like I would add a similar review I read.    Tried to come on Saturday night at 12:50, place says it closes at 2am.  Walk in and they have already done last call and are closing.  I understand it's slow, but I'm not the first this has happened to...change your posted hours to 1am.  Then no harm done."}
{"text":"I would rate them 5 star if this prob didn't happen. But at the end going on dessert you are only allowed to order one (as in just one piece) dessert. I'm a dessert person, so if you are too, I don't recommend this place. Too much rule when it comes to eating all you can eat. Where can you see all you can eat but only allow you to eat one piece of dessert per person from the entire dessert menu?? They taking time on serving your food too and leave you one napkin and you have to ask for extra. This is my first and will be the last time eating here."}
{"text":"OMG I was blown away at how delicious this all you can eat sushi was I ate so much food I'm glad I wore stretchy pants. I can't wait to visit Vegas again so I can come back to this spot. Totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"The food is great, the service is great. Always a good experience when we go. They definitely know our faces and are always welcoming us back. We only get the AYCE and it's always a great experience."}
{"text":"Went to a nice lunch with a vendor.  My favorite foods were the garlic tuna, salmon belly and yellowtail trio.  Other than that, service was slower though the staff did their best.  Not my favorite, but good enough.  Since it is close to where my job is, there might be future plans to have lunch there....lol."}
{"text":"Love the service and the sushi. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the extensive sushi menu."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try some other sushi spots for a while now, and when some friends from out of town flew in this week, another friend organized a dinner outing here.  Really, the food was \"meh.\"   They have a lot of options for all you can eat, and there were three dishes that were absolutely awesome: The fresh scallop, the amaebi (with the heads!), and the gyoza.   Everything else that we ordered was just ok.  A little bland where there should have been more flavor.  The worst part about the evening though, was the service.   While it was super polite and friendly, it was SO slow!  We were there for 2 hours, no joke.   My fiance and I always order in rounds, so we'll do a few orders of several different nigiri options, and by the time we're done with the first one, we'll order more.   We didn't receive several items, and had to go find a server to come back for our second round of orders.    I had thought, briefly, that I'd be willing to come back to give it another go, but realistically...even the slow service at Sumo was better than this place.    I might go back again, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way for it, especially when the spots I frequent have better fish."}
{"text":"I've been to the other Oyshi location, on Rainbow, a handful of times when a friend is in town...its her favorite sushi spot.  Saturday night was the first time I'd been to this location, and I'd definitely return again.  For starters, we were there with a rather large group, about 13 people for a birthday party.  We were seated in the far corner of the restaurant, in a private nook.  It was a really nice section.  I like the look of this location better than the other one...to me, its brighter, and seems a little less run down.  The server we had, I want to say he said that his name was Kenny?  I think it said \"Golden\" on his nametag..., anyway, he was spectacular.   Funny, friendly, triple checked on our orders.  He was really on it.    We were given a couple of \"specialties\" after we let Kenny know we were all having AYCE.  They brought out a ceviche, which I sadly, could not eat. (Avocado Allergy) Everyone else said it was delicious though.  They also brought out a Super White sashimi with a fried jalepeno on it, with an orgasm sauce (not sure if that's what they call it here, but that's what it was.).  This was really tasty. Super white is my favorite anyway, and the jalepeno was sweet with a nice kick.    As always, my husband and I ordered nigiri.   Most of what we ordered was pretty standard, but there were a couple standouts for me:  1.  The squid.  I've never eaten raw squid before; only grilled or fried.  I was anticipating a firm texture, like tako (octopus), but it was tender and delicious.  This was served with a piece of mint under the fish.  The flavor combination was out of this world.  A definite must have.  2. The Super White.  Tender.  Buttery.  Delicate... Pro tip:  Order the fresh wasabi and put some on this. (put some on everything you eat, but this one especially.)  HOLY flavor punch, Batman!  3. The halibut.  Incredible.  I've had halibut a few times, but this one was exceptional.  We really had a good experience here.  The reasons I'm only giving three stars are:  1.  They missed a few pieces of our orders.  Not a huge deal...but I REALLY wanted those oysters, and we didn't really have the opportunity to ask for them, since we ordered those towards the end of the meal, and our server was trying to get a bunch of separate checks organized.  2.  They charge for fresh wasabi.  One of my favorite spots does not charge extra for it, so this was a bummer.  We still got it, because a friend ordered it for us.  Its kind of a bummer to have your dinner budgeted and realize something you really love costs extra, when it doesn't at other places. Now that I know, if we return, we'll be better prepared.  3.  Their hot sake is bloody expensive.  $8 for a large hot house sake?  I'm used to paying $3-5 for a large bottle.   4.  At the end of the night, 3 drinks were brought out and only given to the front half of the table.  First of all...if you're only bringing 3 for us to share (since we didn't ask for them and were not charged for them)...you should probably do one for each section of the table so everyone can share a little bit of one.  Also, the drink was not made well.  It was a Moscow Mule, which is one of my favorites, and it was just not good.  WAY too much mint, not enough lime.   5.  My creme brulee was given to someone at the head of the table instead of me, so I got a half eaten creme brulee at the end of my meal.  (yes, part of that was the fault of the people I dined with, for not asking who ordered it...but if you wrote it down correctly, you should have just brought it to me.)    So...a good experience.  Service was MUCH better than the other location.  Other than the creme brulee thing, and missing my oysters, our server was really good.  People make mistakes, I'm not mad about it...but it does need to be stated.    The food was standard, but again...better than the other location.    I'd definitely come back.  It won't be my first choice, but I won't avoid it either."}
{"text":"Talk about #yummy sushi this place is really good. We dropped in on a Friday afternoon for lunch...all you can eat of course.  It was actually pretty busy for 2PM. Still the sushi was fresh and the service was impeccable!  We never waited more than 7 mins for our next round of sushi orders. We sat at the bar and I think our chef was listening to our discussions over which rolls to get lol by the time we put in our order he was sliding 2 rolls to us!!  Our favorites were the: Snow Mountain, Love Affair, Lobster Affair, Chung Hua and Sibuya. We tried maybe 11 different rolls, poke and nigri.  Awesome place! !!"}
{"text":"A little disappointed considering all the great reviews. I will have to give them another try sometime on someone else's dime.   It's your typical AYCE pricing & rules (literally had a rule menu!!)   First off, came here with 5 people for bday dinner with an expected group of 10, they wouldn't let us sit at our table (which was already reserved and waiting patiently for us) until our entire group arrived.   Finally!!! Were seated. No sever. No water, no edamame. Just a bunch of hungry thirsty bums still waiting.   It took forever to get water and edamame. The menu was extensive but boring. Most of the combo rolls seemed similar to other combo rolls minus or add one insignificant ingredient. I did very much enjoy the pork belly.   Even my Sapporo beer experience was ruined but my non-chilled glass. Did I mention I thought I was at a club with the music blasting techno? Geezus. Overall, it sucked."}
{"text":"If you have a  Sushi craving stop here and squash it.  Its like $26 for all you can eat.  You have to finish everything you order, but man we eat so much Sushi I will not need to see Sushi for the rest of the year... Well maybe in a month or 2 I could enjoy some Sushi again.  Eveything tasted great and we all enjoyed it.  A party of 15 and everyone liked the place so I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Oyshi is my go to ayce, they are always consistent with quality, taste and service.  I always get Monster roll, tiger roll, NYI roll, sibuya, Love affair, surf&turf app, beef asparagus app, gyoza, uni, ikura, unagi, and usually try some specials, The green tea creme brulee and tiramisu are very good, and I'm not usually a dessert person.  These guys are always on point! I love Oyshi Sushi!"}
{"text":"Not only was the food fantastic but the waiter was amazing!!! And the owner actually bussed our table and spoke to us about our experience! Hands down the best!!!"}
{"text":"AYCE, it's amazing. And worth it. The rolls are delish and you'll find many that you'll want to try.  Our entire table got the AYCE and shared multiple rolls so we got to try many on the menu and fell in love with a few. The baked mussels are delicious, and the traditional rolls you can ever go wrong with. From the baked rolls- have the 'Love Affair', you'll thank me later..."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to Oyshi on a regular basis. The food here is good and pricing is fair for their AYCE. Sometimes I do catch them on an \"off\" day and their salmon is not as fresh tasting as I would like it. But what I'll do is order their yumyum overload rolls (any of the big ones). As for their desserts, I think they're ok. Nothing too spectacular. I'd recommend coming here for the consistently good AYCE. Be sure to come with an appetite!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to a few sushi bars in Vegas and this is by far the best one we have been to so far.  If you can, get the bar seats.  They are best in the house and the chefs are all really great"}
{"text":"The All you can eat sushi here is the best in town. Although they have no sashimi, they make up  by giving the freshest fish with small rice. And the sushi rice here is very good."}
{"text":"I've been here dozens of times. I was disheartened to read some of the more recent reviews saying that things had gone downhill. Hoping they were wrong, I came here for lunch and was not disappointed in the least. Service was great, food was brought out quickly and everything was delicious. Oyshi is still on my list of sushi restaurants to frequent."}
{"text":"Tonight we had a birthday dinner with co workers at Oyshi sushi and my review goes like this. 1-10 score  Service 7 Food 8  Atmosphere 8   Now why did I place a 7 and not a 10 possibly because it took approx 20 minutes until I received my water.  Food was good and fresh, a little thick on rice but expected because it's Ayce"}
{"text":"Udon broth was terrible  Basic California roll - have cucumber in it :(  Tempura was cooked properly   Ok atmosphere"}
{"text":"I love their all you can eat sushi here... I wish they would put one in southern cali because this is THE restaurant to go to.  No matter what you order it is delicious and you can eat as much as you can of it!"}
{"text":"Okay so I just left this place about 20 minutes ago. Its okay. The fish was fresh and the service was excellent. The place is nice a bit Japo and a trendy feel to it as well. I could do without the techno music. The one thing i did not really care for was some of the pieces were pretty bland. Although fresh it could of use some kind of sauce on them to bring out flavors. If I go again I will be sure to re-post :)"}
{"text":"Our Favorite all u can eat sushi spot for lunch 20$ dinner 25$ I mean that's a good deal when u consider 2 rolls would be about 26$ alone. They always have a big selection of sushi rolls and appetizers. Including yellowtail and surf and turf grilled rib eye and shrimp!    For fresh sushi hit this spot"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've ever had. It's fresh and tastes great. I've had a lot of sushi and this place is in my top 3 spots. The service is great - Andre rocks!!! The Sahara location never has a wait either!! Watch out the rainbow location always has a wait. Especially on the weekend"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here once a week. Best sushi ever!!! And of course can't forget the great service, Odi is our favorite!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while , but i just came back when i was visiting las vegas and the service was great and the food was great still , imo its one of my favorite ayce places"}
{"text":"Good food. Good atmosphere but not enough staff. The waitress is always running around and never around when needed. I come here for the AYCE and it's worth the price just wish they didn't have 1-2 servers for the what seems like the whole restaurant! Most of your wait is due to your server never available to put in your refills. Plan on being here a few hours waiting for service and then food!"}
{"text":"I ate here with my family and I enjoyed it. The people here are great! The food is good. They have a lot of varieties to choose from. From sushi to Japanese food they have it. Plan on making this one of my favorite sushi bars to eat at."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place!! The all you can eat has so many options, and is the best in town for cooked/fried/baked rolls in my opinion! The AYCE also has great options like surf and turf and tempura for those who are not too crazy about the rolls. Food is always fresh, staff is always friendly. Been going here for years, and it's still my favorite in town!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat near the ACC when we stumbled across this place. Super friendly staff, fast service, good food and good value. The sashimi is decently proportioned, the rolls are massive and delicious and we were given edamame for free. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"It's good for AYCE sushi. You won't be disappointed. Plenty of room, nice decor, and wide menu. My disappointment is no half orders on sushi like other places. Limited to certain order amounts on certain items. Rib eye was a overlooked and tough. Order it rare to medium rare. They didn't ask so I guess that's my fault. Extra charge for tea. Worth a try but I probably won't be back. Our server Toni was great."}
{"text":"Very bad service, nasty food, don't waste your money We had birthday party of 10 AYCE  Oysters ware so old and with salsa on top come on  Sweet shrimp was old taste, we tried several  rolls rice was nasty  Only Miso soup tastes good the rest we couldn't even finish   Server was so slow and didn't bring everything we ordered,   Sorry for my English"}
{"text":"On a Wednesday evening, we had 2 AYCE dinners for ~60.   - Accommodative. They changed the channel for the olympics for us :) - Get the oysters. small but packed with flavor. beware! rocks with the oysters? too fresh :/. LOL - Calamari was a bit too oily. no flavor - Get the baked green mussels. they even cut it in half for you :) - big pieces of yellow tail and salmon for the nigiri :) - The monster roll is deceiving. it's not all soft shell crab. sad that they only use the legs. Ends are shrimp tempura.   - LOVED the salmon skin roll. more skin than salmon means more crunchy :) - the NYI roll barely has soft shell crab. even smaller legs!!! :( - Nuclear roll had a bit too much cream cheese. :/ - Yellow tail trio was a bit too tangy. small pieces of yellow tail - you only get ONE DESSERT! FAIL... - Mango mochi was average. they put a toothpick in it with the plastic on. LOL - Parfait was delicious. but needs more granola. i think the berries and strawberry pieces are frozen. - Although it may sound picky, overall it was pretty delicious or OISHI :)"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight around 6:15. There was quite a line of people but we got seated within 20 minutes, which was great.  First of all, walking inside the restaurant, there was a strong scent of frying oil. I assume the ventilation inside is not strong enough. I've been to KFC and Popeyes without smelling that much oil frying.  We told the hostess our party had 4 people, when she walked us to the table, she took away a setting and set the table for 3, I didn't understand why she did that. So we asked a server to get us another setting, I'm not sure if he didn't hear us or if he was confused because we had to point out what a \"table setting\" was before he went to get it.  We didn't do the AYCE, just a few menu items: Unagi & Avocado Roll: The sushi roll was made badly, the rice was falling apart and there was a lot of avocado, barely any eel and smothered in way too much sauce. Donburi: Donburi is a combo of thin sliced beef (that is NOT all lean meat), egg, onions over rice with sauce in it. The one we got was dry, barely any sauce until you hit way bottom. The beef used was all lean and definitely not thinly sliced. Kids Popcorn Chicken & Teriyaki Chicken meals: The popcorn chicken was overcooked. They definitely fried it for too long. It was dry and some pieces had a burnt taste. My son ate a few pieces and said he didn't like it. The Teriyaki chicken was also overcooked. The chicken was hard to chew.  Service: We saw a lot of servers walking around, but it didn't look like they were doing anything productive. Only the manager (we assume, he was well dressed not in server type uniform) came by multiple times to see if our table was doing OK. Otherwise, the server would come by drop off food and disappear before we can even ask for anything.  Maybe, we'll give it another try in the future, but for now, it was not the dinner we expected to have."}
{"text":"My favorite Sushi place! The food is delicious and the service is friendly. Its always busy which gives it an upbeat feel. NYI Roll is the Best!"}
{"text":"This was one of my first times having AYCE sushi on the west coast! Oyshi was perfect! The wait on a Sunday night wasn't too long. We had waited about 10 mins and we were seated at a table right away. The menu here is vast and close to endless. Definitely many options for the different types of eaters in your party!  Some of my favorites were the oysters, the steak, the veggie and shrimp tempura, and most of the sushis we ordered. It was all you can eat so we had many on our table.   Sad you can only have 1 dessert per person but I enjoyed my berry parfait. Great deal for all you can eat here!"}
{"text":"Very good all you can eat sushi options. The monthly specials were exceptional all be it the salmon belt was average at best.  I would recommend this place and will come back again"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to the Oyshi Sushi restaurant off of Sahara for YEARS, but it's such a far drive for us and the service at that one is often TERRIBLE. A friend recently told us there was an Oyshi off of Rainbow Blvd just 15 minutes from our house so we knew we had to go ASAP. When we walked in there was a line at the host stand and the hostess had all of us sat within 5 minutes. We chose to sit at the bar and do AYCE. Our server was Mono and he was the BEST service we've ever had at an Oyshi restaurant! I cannot speak highly enough of his attention to detail. Thank you Mono! We will be back to this location and request you if you're working."}
{"text":"THERE IS A SECOND LOCATION WITH MUCH BETTER SERVICE AT 7775 S. RAINBOW BLVD! Read my other review, go there instead if you can. Same great taste without the terrible service!  This is the only Sushi place I come to. I've tried a lot of sushi places in Las Vegas, but it's hard to find a place that tastes like it's right on the coast. I'm very picky about quality when it comes to sushi, it's not like a burger where you can deal with it being mediocre. I started coming to this place about three years ago when it was operating under another name, but it's always had the same great quality and taste.   One thing I will say I did not like before was the service. It seemed like they didn't assign a server to your table, so you would just have all these confused servers asking you what you wanted, or needed, and having your order come out with occasional mistakes, and the constant interruption of people not knowing when you were last checked on. It's gotten much better over the years and I can see business has picked up a lot.    I always tell my friends from out of town to try this place instead of somewhere on the strip which costs 3x as much.    To whom it may concern: keep up the great work in the kitchen, and focus on a more personalized floor experience. We don't want to have 5 servers for our table, just one really good one. Thanks for all the great food, we'll be seeing you."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant!!! My new favorite sushi place in Vegas. Not only is it in \"my neck of the woods\"--SW Las Vegas, but it serves wonderful sushi and hot meals, has incredible service and inviting, fun atmosphere. Oyshi does not disappoint, and I have been to most sushi places in town. The fish is always incredibly fresh and delicisous and hot foods and rolls are creative and very tasty. The presentation is top notch too, especially for the price. That's right, the price is on the low side for \"all you can eat\" sushi as compared to other neighborhood sushi places in town; Big flat screen televisions, always running mini fountains and modern decor add to the wonderful, fun, yet inviting atmosphere. Servers all speak English and are knoweledgeable about all of the dishes and make great recommendations!!! I love this sushi restaurant and have frequented it about twice a month, if not more often. Oyshi in Japanese means \"delicious\" and this restaurant surely lives up to its name in every sense of the word. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"THIS BUFFET IS HEAVEN!  Everytime I visit Vegas I will have to visit Oyshi. I live in Chicago and basically Oyshi's sushi buffet kicks all the other sushi buffet's butts in Chicago. Oyshi has a very contempory & modern decor to it, with a cool geisha painting on one of the huge walls.   My dinner at Oyshi was so fast, I couldn't even comprehend the food I ate. For starters - the mussels are a MUST and so is the ahi poke which is very fresh tuna.   Their sushi selection on the menu is so vast you don't even know what to order. If I had to pick only one sushi roll from the menu it would have to be the volcano roll.  The price is definitely worth this buffet which is around $26."}
{"text":"I'm a fan and a regular but sometimes the service is hit or miss. Sitting at the bar is fine, but a couple of times finding your waiter\waitress when you're sitting at a table is ridiculous.  With that said, AYCE sushi is not as amazing as \"regular\" sushi places (i.e. Sushi Fever, I love Sushi, Sushi Loca, etc) but Oyshi is always consistent when it comes to quality and quantity. Definitely worth a trip if you're looking for good AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"There isn't anything special about this all you can eat sushi joint compared to the other but I'll highlight some details.   They have happy hour Monday-Friday from 3:30-5:30 pm which is 20% off. Lunch is 22$ and dinner is 27$. The main detail I noticed on the menu that differs between the two is that dinner include one order of uni and other dishes... also all you can eat does not include sashimi too. Similarly to other ayce sushi place you can not share but it seems they allow some people in the same parties to not participate in the ayce options.  The staff is friendly and we came as a group so our order was completed slowly... it seems during the lunch time they only have two sushi chefs which cause the slowness but other sushi places seem that way too.   Wasn't too busy with us as a table and two other table being used. The environment is clean and the bathroom is well maintained."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Great food.  Great Staff.  The thing that impressed me most was how they treated my family.  I went with a friend and their kids so we had a lot of kids, some very small.  They treated them extremely well, explained the parts of sushi ordering culture we weren't familiar with, and were super attentive and patient.  This is how a restaurant should be."}
{"text":"Oyshi is the spot! Good ambiance and great service. Stefan was friendly and informative, & made it more fun. The energy here is great. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of our favorite spots in town. So glad that they opened another location. Seems to be far more spacious than the Rainbow location. We went last night (Saturday) for dinner and there was no wait. You know how rare this is if you've ever been to the original.  Food was awesome as usual. Tastes so fresh. Every time I take someone new I love when it hits them that \"ohhh.... so THIS is what good sushi tastes like!\" Took full advantage of the AYCE offer. From the spicy heart attack, to the savory dynamite... it's all good.   Get there soon... before it becomes as popular as the first locations and you find yourself waiting an hour plus to be seated."}
{"text":"I brought a friend of mine to this, my favorite sushi restaurant, and I could not have asked for a better experience. Although we had to wait 30+ min to be seated, everything was great once we got to our table. Here is a recap:  Service: Awesome! Our waitress was friendly and checked back with us often. Our food arrived quickly at our table (even faster than the times when they were less busy and I sat at the bar), and we were made to feel comfortable by the staff.  Food: Better than ever. All of our rolls were presented with delicacy and tasted great. Even though the place was packed, I felt like the chefs really took the time to prepare the best rolls for us, and yet did not take forever to make our orders.  Quick tip: Do yourself a favor and try the heart attack and the amigo roll. They are out of this world!"}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from my house so I have been here several times. I usually sit at the bar as it is quiet and I enjoy watching them make the rolls. The wait staff is friendly and quite quick, however I notice that when it gets busy some orders are forgotten about, needing to re-submit them. But alas, the food is very good, and being so close, I will definitely come back many more times."}
{"text":"Sushi was delicious and they had a ton of variety on the menu. AYCE is always the best route to go because it opens up the entire menu for you. Waitress was nice but we didn't see too much of her besides when she delivered our rolls. We had to ask for refills on our drinks because she want checking up on us. Food made up for the lack of customer service. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"We made reservations for a party of 15 we didn't have to wait.  That part was great, as far as ordering and getting the food timely and accurately that is a different story.  I think it was because we had too many orders or something.  We had a group of people that loved to eat.  We order things that went to the table next to us they were a big party as well.  I heard our our screaming went to them because they didn't know what was ordered and they said okay we'll take it.  The food was okay not as good as I remember and I like another place that we go to better. . After to night experience it confirms that I wouldn't go there.   The following I found 1 star: Oysters (they taste really bad not fresh' and needed lemon) Adegashi tofu (they give you one and it is now sweet or yummy.   The decent but small pieces: Fresh scallop Eel Fried scallops  the fried scallops was small size but tasted yummy.  Why not isn't everything fried best?  The rib eye steak was ok but some of it was just too well done so it was tough.   The surf and turf is better with the rib eye and two shrimps. It comes in a sizzling platter,  Poke was like two little bites.  Photos of this was way generous then   The favs for the night: Garlic tuna Albacore Salmon belly Octopus Uni was low grade Sweet shrimp eh. We got a bunch of other rolls but really it is the atmosphere here that attract people imo. The nigiri sushi was the best.   The ice cream was out of mochi, the cream brûlée was in a small little ramekin.  They only allow one dessert order why is that so small?  The parfait on the other hand is like a shake glass and large."}
{"text":"The food started yummy and plentiful the server Ryan was good.  We ordered the rib eye steak the first was plentiful then the second was less and the third round was more like where's the beef.  The Nigiri sushi was yummy.  See my photos.  The shrimp tempuras was hot I liked the red dragon.   Our food didn't come timely everyone was done with their dessert while I still waited for the Crete brûlée.  Our server came to give us the check and I had to tell him we did not get the Crete brûlée."}
{"text":"Discovered a few more favorites: -NYI roll -banzai roll -uni nigiri (be warned, some of the pieces were darker so I'm guessing they have a mixture between premium and select ca grades)  I guess I'll update this place with 5 stars because it seems to already have secured its spot in our vegas regimen. We even sit at the same table every time too (the big semiprivate one that's behind noren on the right side of the restaurant with the cool mural). As always, we ate til our hearts content. Food comes out reasonably timed and prompt for the most part and service is never lacking."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch for the first time 5/5/16.... I will be going back ASAP. Because my time was short I just had Tempura Udon soup... it was fabulous and large enough that I took left overs. The lunch menu has a ton of items, the prices are good. The decor is wonderful, the server was nice and I got back to work on time. I will be back"}
{"text":"Okay, went there for lunch with few of my co-workers, we flew in from los angeles for the all you can eat sushi work for the airlines so this is easy.  The sushi was a hit and miss, some of the rolls were good and some were not. The nigiri sushi was also a hit and miss.  Most of the fish seemed fresh, some seemed like it just came from the freezer and thawed.    The selection was great you had  a lot of choices in terms of rolls and appetizers  1. when we got there the place was empty except a few couples, but why did the sushi take so long to get, no lie it took like 20 minutes for our first order which didnt make any sense to me.  2. the side orders (appetizers came out really quick. i really believe you can make a meal out of the sides alone. they were really good. like the Asian skirt steak.  3. would i go back and try again , ya i would give it one more try."}
{"text":"An extensive AYCE menu at a low price. Especially for this area. Lunch for two with a bottle of sake came to a little over $60 before tip.   Oyshi is one of the only places that uses lobster in their dishes. I wish it was a little more distinguishable though. Mixed in with the diced crab stick, it is difficult to taste the natural sweetness of the lobster. I am not a huge mayo fan either, but did not dislike any of the dishes because of it. The fact that it was not mixed with half a jar made it bearable.  The rice is the most important part of the sushi. Even though we were there early, the rice was cooked off early enough to let it properly cool. There is nothing worse than warm fish and rice that falls apart when picked up.   The nigiri list is smaller than some of the other sushi joints, but the items we got were all fresh."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you are starving. Get here during lunch time to eat for dinner. The service is so slow. We've been waiting over 50 mins for 4 rolls."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite all you can eat sushi place in Las Vegas. I've been coming here since right after I moved here when they were pretty new, in early 2008. I am pretty much obsessed with some of their rolls, my favorites are Full Moon, Lava Flow, Nyi, Red Rock, and Treasure, but I honestly haven't tried anything I don't like. The nigiri it's always delicious, and I also definitely recommend the Vanilla Berry Parfait for dessert. I am disappointed that they stopped carrying \"white tuna\" aka Escolar, but that seems to be city-wide. The private rooms are great for larger groups, I'd suggest making a reservation ahead of time for those. They have plenty of beer, wine, and sake, and the best part is that Oyshi is open until 3am! Best AYCE sushi in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Oyshi is one of my favorite ayce restaurant. The food there is very good.  I used to be a very loyal customer even though the service, which is very slow. The first round comes pretty much fast but if you reorder, it comes very very slow , so slow that you want to leave the place. I still wanted to give them 4 stars because it is very cheap with a very good food quality. If the service were better, they would deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"Oyshi is our go-to spot for AYCE sushi.  Everyone that works here is super cool and most nights the service is quick, unless they're slammed.  The variety of rolls is good  and they are generous with their sauces, which makes it for me.  They don't offer sashimi on the AYCE menu, but not many places do.  All of their hot dishes are yummy too!  They have specials that are written on the dry erase board on the wall behind the sushi bar.  We like to start with the Salmon Lover's Roll and I like to end on the sweet & cheesy Japanese Lasagna.  It's so close to my house I could walk there, but there's no way that I would be able to walk home!"}
{"text":"Their service kinda sucks, but the food is excellent.  I always do the AYCE and usually got for the Bonsai Roll, ahi poke, gyoza, miso soup, grilled beef asparagus and some sushi (garlic tuna, cajun albacore)  YUM!!"}
{"text":"Being a Vegas local, I hear the buzz about Oyshi ALOT. It's been a successful sushi business for a few years now. My first visit was a couple of years ago but it wasn't that memorable to me, but two Thursdays ago, it was VERY  memorable.  But not in a good way.  I understand that a restaurant doesn't really decide when it's busy or not. But when I went two weeks ago on a Thursday for dinner, I really didn't expect the amount of neglect that my party of three received. We all ordered off of the AYCE menu and some dishes from the kitchen.   In the duration of 30 minutes, we got nothing from the kitchen except miso soup. When we asked our server, he just nonchalantly shrugged and said it was a busy night. Barely saw him after that and just felt like he was avoiding our table.   When we did get our nigiri and rolls, I really did wish it could've been SO MUCH BETTER to redeem the time that we wasted. There was so much rice in our sushi that it might've been better to just serve a bowl of rice. I understand that you're not supposed to discard the rice but I'm not paying for the rice, I'm under the impression that I'm paying for the sushi.  That night, we ordered dessert but we didn't have energy to waste another 20 minutes. We just left.  I really wanted to like this place after my very first encounter years ago wasn't that impressive. But seems like this restaurant has proved that first impressions always last."}
{"text":"To all my fellow sushi lovers. Listen to the reviews that say the sushi is mediocre. Nice restaraunt nice staff but for the sushi I won't be back to this place. Hope you guys listen and don't do what I did and find out on your own."}
{"text":"Our first time tonight, and the reviews we read on Yelp did not disappoint. It was a very clean environment the temperature was nice and chill so you know the sushi was good. Me and my wife both like the fact that they had specialty cuts of fish such as konch shell fish, salmon belly, halibut fin, and even scallop raw. Our server was very helpful and guiding us through the menu and even helping us learn how to drink a sake bomb. We sat at the bar and cook was very helpful. Recommending cuts of fish that he thought we might enjoy. And even stearing us in the right direction for dessert. The price was only a few dollars more than where we used to go as regulars, but here we felt that we were treated nicer and also got fresher fish for our money. If you make a trek to this location, be sure to sit next to Pete at the bar. The guy knows his way around the sushi bar and is very entertaining with his blow torch when he is searing items. Definitely worth the extra dollars if you're going to spend the money on sushi anyways.  ***edit***  After multiple trips and somewheres in 100's of lbs of fish consumed we are still incredibly happy with this establishment."}
{"text":"Hands down, the food is amazing!   That's why we come here, but you have to come at odd hours because the servers suck whether you sit at the bar or in the restaurant.   If you come when they are busy, the service is a D at best.  They act like their head is in the clouds.    But for food, love the atomic bomb, love affair,  dynamite roll, etc.  I could keep going and love the all you can eat.  They just need help with how to be a good food server."}
{"text":"I love this place ! I am a Sushi fanatic, and quite picky about my Sushi, when my son and I went to Oyshi, we were quite impressed with the friendly staff, the fast service, and the fresh Sushi ! This place is 5 stars to me and I will continue to recommend them to all my friends ! They are really busy so be prepared to wait a bit, but well worth it ! Kellyann"}
{"text":"01.07.12  Preface: This review had been shortened & edited from an 8-page thesis which I will someday publish as \"Can Fresh Sushi be Found in the Middle of the Desert?\"  POSITIVE:  * My 18 y.o. niece (Las Vegas native) recommended this sushi restaurant. \"Uncle, this place is the BOMB!\" * Off the L.V. Strip  NEGATIVE: * Host not attentive to the waiting guests (first time I've ever seen a restaurant host partake in drinking with guests during a work shift). * Waitress/Server never there when we needed her - asking if we needed anything every 90 seconds the last 15 minutes of our stay. * Food seemed like it sat too long before reaching the table.  * Beer not chilled enough. (maybe it sat out too long before being served as well). * Water glasses were never serviced nor were we asked if we wanted anything else to drink. * The time waiting to be seated succeeded the time spent eating at the table * Overpriced less than average fare for an over-rated joint.  Will I return? Sure...if I sit at the sushi bar & someone else pays.  Truth! deez® out."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!! I ventured here, because it is quite a distance from my abode. I was not disappointed in the least and plan on making the trek regularly in the future. The combination of rolls and appetizers on their AYCE menu is vast. They have the cooked rolls with mayo and crab and crunch that my sister loves and they also have the poke and Cajun albacore that I adore. Service was impeccable and the lunch price at $21 is totally worth it. My nephew ate for $14 AYCE. This is definitely one of my fave AYCE places in town!"}
{"text":"I was happy this location opened, it's so much closer than driving all the way to rainbow and 215. Sushi chef Daniel is amazing with his creations. The friendliness of all the staff is quite remarkable. The fish is always fresh and they're quick to make recommendations. The spacious room is huge and gets filled quickly on a weekend night but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years for the all you can eat and I think it's one of the best... I like that you can order half rolls at the bar so you can try more rolls . They always have good music and a great ambiance!"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit to Oishi Sushi here in Vegas over last 5 years or so. One of the high-fluting sushi places in 5 star hotels I have stayed come close to the friendly service (EJ is an excellent server!) and variety of excellent dishes! I will return here for sure in my future trips to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food was good except for the EGG roll it had a funky taste. But our server EJ gave as excellent service we are happy customers ."}
{"text":"Mikey our server for tonight has been really pleasant and on top our orders good food + good customer service = A 5 Star review."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great sushi and nice environment. I used to go to the Oyshi on south rainbow and they are awesome too. This location is closer to me. Sit at the sushi bar and you get to order half rolls!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for this joint. I go here frequently. Every time I open the menu I search for a new roll to try and I end up confused and indifferent to my selection. I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese or eel in my rolls. Oddly, these two items (but mainly the cream cheese) makes it hard for me to find one that sound appealing without modification. It's a large menu but I can never seem to find a roll that sounds 'amazing' as written.   They offer all you can eat which is great for big eaters. We typically order a couple rolls, some baked mussels, a few hot sakes, and mochi. Each time the server has comped off one or more of the smaller items because we were paying the regular prices so it always comes out to about the same cost as if we had done all you can eat.  Service can be spotty but if you're not in a rush it's a nice spot to grub on some sushi basics."}
{"text":"Good location but Low quality of sushi and terrible service! The service here is super slow! and server forgot your order such a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Oyshi is the hands down BEST sushi in Vegas! Both Rainbow and Sahara locations are fab. All-You-Can-Eat includes all sushi, rolls, appetizers and even a dessert :) Super cool atmosphere always with good/electronic music, sweet waitresses, bad ass sushi chefs and the sushi is oh so delicious. Tell the sushi chef what you like and have him whip you up something special :)"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in Vegas! Here with Sidney Eileen"}
{"text":"They take too long to bring out food for AYCE and the rice seems like its old. They didn't take our order for a long time. I didn't get my last order. Dessert took forever to come out also."}
{"text":"Will not return. All you can eat at its WORST!! stay away. they have no idea about cleaning in this place. Check out they're recent health inspections no wonder we got sick!!! http://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/restaurants/inspections.php"}
{"text":"So my friend took me to this place after a tiring day back from Grand Canyon.  Service: from the moment we walked in, we were greeted by great customer service. Throughout our experience here, they were attentive, service was fast and amazing.  Food: Wasn't \"blown away\" by the food but it was pretty decent. The quality and preparation was awesome and some exceeded expectations. For example, the oysters were very clean and served just right! (And this is coming from the guy who doesn't like raw oysters) The sea urchin sushi was superb too. I was too hesitant that it would be too raw and gooey but it was rich creamy like half boiled egg yolk. Try the surf and turf too because the meat wasn't a brush off. It was soft and juicy, for the price that was paid for it, it definitely stands out. All the sushi and the rolls, had great rice to ingredient ratios as well so you don't have to worry about getting too much rice and not enough seafood.  Overall I'd give this a 3.5-4 Star experience!"}
{"text":"Had to give my two cents given all the overblown reviews this place has. Don't get me wrong the sushi was not bad - the albacore was tasty even though it was warm. Two of the rolls were ok, not delicious, but good. What this place needs to step up in is on service. Staff friendly but not as attentive as they could've been. I never received my Sapporo and was billed for it (I didn't pay for it).I imagine the trick is ordering the AYCE. The table next to us had it and received regular service, in fact, their water glasses were filled while ours were left empty. Place is not worth the lengthy drive from the strip."}
{"text":"Tried their AYCE. ($22 for lunch)  Pros: All sushi and appetizer were very delicious.  Service was great.  Loved their interior design.   Cons: Sunomono supposed be a vinaigrette salad, but, their sunomono was different... (shredded cucumber with creamy sesame sauce???) Hot tea wasn't free, but, you get a teapot.  Definitely be back."}
{"text":"the service egain one sushi chef for the whoole restaurant, extra slow service,in other words bad service, we never went back, n not to organise, the sushi guy dress in adidas shirt n terrible hat, not drss properly to his job, thanks"}
{"text":"Omfg!   Everything from the wasabi to the rolls was FANTASTIC.   The sizes are cut appropriately small so you can thoroughly enjoy an AYCE experience.   Definitely will come here again on date nite with my wife."}
{"text":"We had an 8:30 reservation. We were seated about 9. Our waiter was ridiculously rude. My husband isn't a sushi person and this annoyed the waiter to no end. Service was very slow. Sushi was just OK. I wouldn't eat here again free. We went with two young men. They could have eaten more but the service was so slow we gave up and left. Also, the music is way too loud for the inadequate sound system they have."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Came here for dinner. When I checked in the lady told me it would be 20-30 minutes. After an hour and a half passed we finally are seated. It took 15 minutes to get a waitress over. We put our drinks and food in... 45 minutes later.. still had not received our food. We brought the matter up to the manager and he said if we didn't like it we knew where the door is. I am very disappointed. I will be calling the higher ups of the restaurant and will never be back. Thanks for nothing"}
{"text":"My family went here last night...as we go pretty often at least 2-3 times a month.  Hunby and I were so sick after eating here last night.  We were told that the chefs were behind, we waited 20 min for a seat, not even half the seats were filled.  The food tasted off...but since you have to pay for what you don't eat, my husband ate his knowing it wasn't quite right.  My son and I don't eat sushi, but the only thing my husband and I had that my son did not have was rice.  We were both so sick upon arriving home.  My husband said the kamakazi (spelling??) and tuna tasted funny but he ate it anyway.  Not sure we would eat here again."}
{"text":"Delicious! Finally, a reasonably priced all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant that doesn't sacrifice quality. The portions on individual rolls might be smaller than you expect, so don't be shy about getting AYCE! Best in class."}
{"text":"Very good as far as ayce goes. They really have some quality rolls. I think I've had some better starters/appetizers at other ayce sushi spots but as far as rolls they are solid. My only drawback is the last few times I have been in this restaurant there have been lots of flies buzzing around for some reason. The food still tastes good but flies ruined our last few experiences landing on our table and even our sushi. We haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Always hard for me to comment on how the quality of AYCE sushi is to another, considering this would only be my second one. I've never been a fan of raw anything, so I usually stay away from places where sushi is the main dish.  I'm trying though!   I've graduated and have been eating sushi (cooked of course) here and there.   Back to my review! Wait time on a Saturday was little to none, which was absolutely amaze balls. A group of 6 of us came to eat, and we're immediately seated. Our server Game, was so sweet. He was quick to respond and had are orders coming out. He was apologetic at the end when some desserts were not available.  Great time, good corner table and constant refills on point.   We ordered: Rock and roll  Veggie tempura  Quail egg Caterpillar roll  Coco Monster  Ahi poke Dynamite roll  App dynamite  Calamari  Red dragon  Hawaiian  Crazy Cali  Tiger roll Green tea = wtf Parfait  Choco creme brule"}
{"text":"Consistently good food and consistently bad service.. what can I say I am torn.  They have a great menu of rolls, decent ayce prices, their ahi poke is on point, but on the other hand I have had too many bad service experiences from them to count.. For that I would say there is better in Vegas and its worth looking for."}
{"text":"Toronto's got sushi covered top to bottom. Meaning, we have some of the best you can get for your money, and also some of the worst. Oyshi Sushi sits right in the middle of that scale and thats just fine. A nicely furnished little unit with friendly staff that offers a pretty standard menu but all at a fair price. If you have a craving for sushi, there's plenty of places you can hit if your looking to withdraw your daily cash limit from the ATM to be fed. However, there's places like Oyshi that has prices on the cheaper side, but maintains pretty good quality. Usually sushi places I've been to that offer sushi at these prices have been regrettable decisions. Oyshi is middle of the pack and is absolutely worth a visit if you have a sushi craving and aren't looking to pay for your meal with your most recent paycheque. After a long walk on the harbourfont or a visit to center island, its a nice quiet place to decompress.   The tuna rice dome is particularity yummy."}
{"text":"Waste of $45. Was just flavorless and proper sauces were not given.  SMITHS market woulda been better, fresher and cold!  The fish was room temp and then on my one fried roll the outside was so gummy.  I just followed my gut intuition and go to the SMITHS market next time!  :("}
{"text":"Decent all ypu can eat sushi place. Close to my house so you cant beat that I can almost walk it."}
{"text":"Extensive menu, fast service, and delicious food. This place is an absolutely amazing choice for good sushi. The Oyshi on Rainbow was always my go to before, but I am so glad that they opened up a second location that is more convenient for me. The garlic albacore is a must."}
{"text":"I've been to this sushi place 3 times.. My first two experiences here were alright.. The all you can eat is at a reasonable price and the rolls were ok. But the third time I came in was this last week.. I was very disappointed.. First it took them forever to seat us and there wasn't a lot of people.. There was no one in line and they only had a few people in the restaurant. Then all around our service was bad. Our waitress took a long time to take our orders and once we were done with a dish multiple waiters and bussers would walk by and they still wouldn't take away our dirty plates.. Eventually the dishes just piled up. Even when they brought new rolls out they wouldn't take our plates away.. Then to top off a bad experience the sushi was subpar if that. We could tell the fish was previously frozen so it took away the flavor of the fish. I was very disappointed.. The whole experience was bad."}
{"text":"(4.5 stars)  My trip to Vegas would not be complete without a visit to Oyshi Sushi. Though it's off strip, I'm lucky my best friend lives close enough so we can make a trip every time I'm there.   My last visit was the first time I've done their All You Can Eat deal, and for $26, it was WELL WORTH IT! The only things it DOESN'T include are the Chef's Special Sashimi, so all your appetizers, salads, specialty rolls and desserts are included. My friends and I went all out and ordered several to share of every course. Oysters were delicious and baked mussels (while too much mayo sauce) was to die for. Tempura dishes are nice and crispy and not too soggy or heavy. My favorite salad is their ahi poke on top of seaweed salad - YUM! We shared 6 specialty rolls that were all delicious in their own ways. Again their specialty \"yum yum\" sauce is \"yum yum\", but in small amounts. The mochi ice cream is like the type you buy at the store, but again, it's all part of the deal so might as well indulge! We also got a bottle of lychee flavored cold sake that was decently priced and balanced the sweet:alcohol ratio perfectly.  Service is good: unless its super busy, the wait staff always comes up to check on your group, make sure your water is filled, etc. As with any sushi place, baked rolls will take longer, so be patient! They did forget one of our orders at one point, but since we were eating so much, it gave us time to digest.  If you can make the trip out with a group who enjoys sharing specialty rolls and can throw down in eating, Oyshi is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Never written a review before but this was just ridiculous.. Had been to this location multiple times and always had pretty good service. On a Wednesday night we did AYCE we were here for over 2 1/2 hours because of absolutely awful service(I actually took a 15-20min nap at the table and still nothing had changed)! Multiple times we waited over an hour for food, the times we got food it was the food runner throwing random stuff we didn't want or order and she would ignore us and run off before we could say anything. Table was never cleared until almost 2 hours in. Had to get up at times and get someone to help us so we could get refills on water or put in an order for more food we would have to wait forever for. Then after all this the manager didn't even care! Just said sorry very unapologetically and had to almost argue to get a discount on the meal that we most definitely deserved. Very disappointing. I had always liked this place and now I don't know if I will ever eat here again because of this experience which sucks because the food is always good :/"}
{"text":"Agree with several who have commented already, the service was horrible at best. The waitress barely looked at us when she spoke, kept calling my wife and I \"you guys\" and did not listen to our answers when she asked a question. Also no half rolls disappointing. No comparison to Yama Sushi or a couple of other places that we often frequent. Would not recommend the all you can eat as with opinion is not a good value at this restaurant. Perhaps if sitting at the Sushi bar the service would be better.  Might add; have had the pleasure of enjoying Sushi around the world, not just various locations in the US and VEGAS in particular. Doesn't make me an expert by any means, but perhaps a little more adept on determining what I expect. Whether it be Japan, Korea, Europe, Guam, Hawaii, Taiwan, or here in the US, service is service and quality is the same expectation regardless. If a restaurant wants to be great, they have to be consistent."}
{"text":"So yesterday for a late lunch/early dinner my friends wanted to try a new sushi place. He was going to drive so I said sure wherever you want to go. He and our other friend heard good things about this place. We arrive and it turns out our other friend has been here once but forgot (haha hope this isn't bad news).   Turns out it was really good. I like the decor of the place and the music playing makes it feel kind of clubby haah. Our waitress was nice to let us switch from the table to the bar so we could get our orders in faster. We all stuffed our faces full of sushi. Large selection of sushi to choose from so you should find something you like. Since the day I had some cream cheese in sushi I am a fan so when I saw it on the menu I had to try everyone that had cream cheese haha. For dessert which I gave to my friend I had the strawberry mochi. He had the green tea ice cream.  I give it 3 stars. I love the sushi and the guys were friendly making the sushi and the waitress was friendly too. It's far for me but if in the area it is the place I would stop at."}
{"text":"We were seated right away. Waiter was friendly and always kept our drinks filled. The food also kept coming out pretty quick. It was also very good too. Definitely one of our favorite sushi spots. And surf & turf on the all you can eat menu too?!"}
{"text":"A few other people have already complained about the service  Not sure our server's name, maybe it was also Kevin, maybe not.  Considering every place we went in Vegas was wonderful and the service incredibly good, it was quite a contrast that the service at Oyshi was so poor.  I didn't like the server because his language and behavior was like high school kid.  I understand a $50 meal for two isn't luxury, but it isn't cheap.  Also we tried to wave at him 3-4 times and he wouldn't acknowledge we were there.  It takes the fun out of going to a buffet.  I wonder if management does this on purpose so people don't eat too much.  We eventually changed servers, but I felt like they didn't care that much.  In my whole life, I've never felt angry at a restaurant.  Honestly, I get more polite and better service at McDonald's.  At times the server was just talking to his friends, the cook about girls.  We felt uncomfortable at this place and just left after a few dishes.  It was a waste of money and no one likes to do that.  Food is fine for this kind of thing so no complaints there.  But it's important for customer to feel comfortable at a restaurant.  Do not go here.  Literally every other worker and server and person in Vegas we met was awesome, had a wonderful time.  But this restaurant was a bad experience."}
{"text":"Excellent quick Service to my party of 15, everything was great from food to customer service, Thanks to my Server Mono!"}
{"text":"Eveytime I go here it is excellent. I never had anything bad here. Got to go early cause this place gets packed."}
{"text":"Been going here many, many years since it opened. Still one of the best AYCE places in SW Las Vegas. Clean establish, fast & friendly service. Good quality. I just wished they didn't give so much rice with their sushi pieces."}
{"text":"I'm no sushi expert by any means, but I know what's good to me. Baked rolls are great as are the spicy rolls. Seems like a younger crowd that hangs out here and they play great music. Definitely do the all you can eat so you can sample the different styles of rolls. Worth the $20 every time. Always take friends and family here when they are visiting. This place can get busy and service can be slow at times, but it is always worth it!"}
{"text":"Love love love the spicy tuna crunch. I'm not a fan of sushi but my god this is so good. And can't beat AYCE lunch for $22."}
{"text":"I do love sushi and Oyshi's is good, but the AYCE service leaves something to be desired. Service is very slow, and orders come when the chef decides to prepare them, not when you ordered it.  Orders have been forgotten and errors made repeatedly. Because its all-you-can-eat maybe there's a sense that mistakes don't matter if you accept the dish, since it's all the same price.    Those complaints aside, the food is done well and isn't oversized and sloppy like some AYCE places. You can tell the chefs care about presentation. I can't think of any food of poor quality there.    My tips for this place would be to: 1) come with a list 2) order a variety of items at once. When they arrive, order the next batch.  3) make sure everyone at the table agrees to order in batches, otherwise everyone  will be sitting around waiting for ages until your next lonely order arrives- and that second order could take 30 minutes or more! 4) save room for the tiny dessert. It comes with the AYCE."}
{"text":"Owner shows up late and place couldn't open for lunch, just lost a sushi fan due to lack of business ownership!"}
{"text":"Were I come from, all you can eat sushi means buffet, which also means stay away. So when Khatherine T. and I made a sushi date and she suggested AYCE, I about died. Thankfully, Oyshi Sushi has opened my eyes to the other side of AYCE.  Even though this was my first real experience with AYCE, I still ordered off the menu, LOL! Should have and would have tried it, but the BF begged me to bring him left overs, the AYCE rules require you to finish eating everything you order. Nuts! Next time the BF can get his own sushi, I'm going big or going home!  Our server was so nice! He made several recommendations of really good rolls, I like mine spicy and he knew which were hot and which were too hot. He even told me one roll to stay away from. He was attentive and made sure we always had food in front of us and our water glasses stayed full. Khatherine was a pro at this, she didn't even have to look at the menu, she knew everything she wanted and ordered each time he came back to the table. She knew how to keep the sushi coming, and everything that came to the table looked delicious!  The sushi was good, not amazing, but good. I tried the Monster Roll (it was so big I had a hard time fitting it in my mouth!), the Rainbow Roll (by BF's request), and the Red Dragon. The Red Dragon was by far my favorite!! My order actually ended up being more expensive than the AYCE, but at least I could bring leftovers home. Now I need to plan date night with the Beau so that we can come back and try the AYCE together."}
{"text":"So V. and I headed to this spot on our way out of Las Vegas to L.A. and i am adding this place to my favorites whenever in Vegas...  Service is Decent,The food is great and they have plasmas where i got to see the Lakers take on the Rockets! So that was awesome,Sushi and watching the game...How cooler can you get...jk  So this was what V and I had/tried:  Philly Roll Rainbow Roll Tiger Roll Dynamite Roll Ginza Roll Spyder Roll 2 orders of Yellowtail 2 orders of Albacore 5 orders of Tuna 5 orders of Salmon Vanilla Creme Brulee Strawberry Mochi Ice Cream  Everything was really good and fresh(on a sunday!)   yea,i have experienced some places on sunday,and the fish never tasted this fresh.  So the deal is this,Only 2 hours to eat and no Sashimi,that works for me,regardless!  Thanks for reading,hit this one spot when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Decent all you can eat sushi in Las Vegas. Place seems cool but it seems as they have no decor.  Food was good, many options to choose from. Waited about 30 minutes without a reservation and the staff was helpful.  With many all you can eat places especially in sushi in this town this place was okay."}
{"text":"I began eating here years ago at the other location and let me tell you that they never disapoint. Always fresh.  My friends call it techno sushi because of the music they play.  I rate it a 10."}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful food. All-you-can-eat is a must if you're going in a group. Check out their special menu located behind the bar."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere, the service is friendly,  and the sushi is creative and tasty. The AYCE is a bit expensive but the variety of rolls really makes up for it. Ate there twice and would happily go back again."}
{"text":"Great sushi!   I walked in and had to wait about 5 minutes which is not a big deal at all. I would wait much longer to eat here again. Waiter was very friendly and made suggestions. The menu is very big and definitely worth it if you are going to eat at least 3 rolls. Plus, you get the option of ordering appetizers and other sides. The only down side to Oyshi is the time it takes to bring out your food. Other sushi places in town are very quick to get orders to the table. I went a second time hoping it was just an off night in the kitchen but the service was still incredibly slow. We were at our table for 10 minutes before anyone came to greet us, which is annoying but the food here is worth the wait I suppose."}
{"text":"This is our absolute favorite place to eat sushi! Great atmosphere, friendly staff and a great variety. You absolutely can't beat they're all you can eat price. The bonsai is my favorite. The only downside that I see is the wait is sometimes long but with food this good, it's worth it"}
{"text":"Christmas lunch with my lady and friends! Andre is our server and he's so nice and friendly. Really chill. Thanks for the good service, Andre!"}
{"text":"Used to be my go-to place for sushi but I've had so many bad experiences, especially at dinner that I just cant' stand it anymore.  I always gave them a pass because they were so close to my house.  Here's my list of gripes:  -Sushi is not the freshest in town in comparison to other AYCE.  I had some  Spanish mackerel that literally I had to spit out. -Service is horrendous, especially for dinner when they are swamped with customers. -Most of the non-fish dishes are greasy and badly cooked.  I suppose they are good because they are so huge they have a lot of variety.  But who cares when it doesn't taste good."}
{"text":"Great place. Nice atmosphere very laid back. The food was delicious. Like the non sushi menu. Server was great and had nice recommendations."}
{"text":"Perfect. So friendly and great for our 4 year old son. Love the menu options. We will be back."}
{"text":"TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS: Best and freshest sushi place in town!  If you can splurge for all you can eat It Is definitely the way to go!  Super selection-The yellowtail and garlic tuna are amazing!  Fresh everytime  and melts in your mouth.  Top 5  favorite rolls - I think what makes these so good is the eel sauce (slightly sweet):  1) Atomic bomb (kind of a sad name for a japanese roll but I digress) - spicy jalapeno on top and siracha 2) Monster roll - huge but has all the goodies  3) Simply shrimp- light and sweet 4) Red dragon- spicy tuna roll sweet and spicy yum! 5) Tiger roll - similar to red dragon buy with shrimp tempura added  Just tried their hand roll last night - They have a killer shrimp and avocado one. Not on the menu but they'll make it for you.   Appetizers: Seaweed salad Excellent tempura-always fresh and hot never oily Surf and turf-steak and shrimp appetizer. One order enough for two people to share  Desserts (all you can eat is one dessert per person) Mochi of course!! Yogurt parfait is big, especially after a large meal, but very tasty  Some negatives:  Oyshi can get really busy.  They do take reservations and have two private rooms available.  Also, not a big fan of the \"baked sushi\" although the california crunchy roll is pretty good if you like baked.  All in all, this is my favorite sushi place in town and really hard to beat.  This place is a \"must\" for any yelper!"}
{"text":"Love love love! This place is the best, large assortment of rolls and so many options so other menu items that are included in the all you can eat."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Oyshi as it is just minutes from my house. There is definitely something to be said about convenience! That said, the sushi is pretty damn good here as well. Much better than other AYCE (all-you-can-eat) places in town. Though I do argue with my friend about what's better between Oyshi and Sushi-mon so I'd call it a coin flip.  The only reason I didn't give Oyshi 5 starts is because of the service. Every once in a while you'll find yourself wanting to order sushi for 10 minutes or more because you haven't seen your server. Simple solution for this is to sit at the sushi bar. Nothing I would knock it down to 3 stars for because overall is still great sushi and a good experience!"}
{"text":"I have to say that this all-you-can-eat sushi buffet wasn't too bad. The service and ambiance was definitely better than Sushimon, but when it comes down to quality, taste, and presentation....Sushimon wins the competition!  If you don't mind driving a bit off the strip, then come to this sushi place. It was only $22 for lunch when my friends and I went here on a Saturday.  Sorry, peeps...Sushimon is still better for me..."}
{"text":"AYCE this place is awesome and everything tastes great wish I could have more than one premium dessert but I guess I could just have another sush roll instead? Don't do one offs just go AYCE so worth it!"}
{"text":"How this place has over 3 stars is beyond me. This was my second visit and it was horrible. The food was undercooked or miscooked. The bathrooms were atrocious. When I asked the server where the employees use the bathroom she said the ones where everyone else does. That wouldn't be an issue if there was soap in that bathroom. So these employees use the dirty bathroom then can't properly wash their hands then handle your food. Lovely. When I brought these issues to the servers attention and asked to speak to the manager, there isn't a manager there, she was sorry, made no adjustments for the food and walked off. $80 spent ok a place where the quality of food is not a concern and they aren't clean."}
{"text":"All you can eat... Check. Great quality fish... Check. Open for lunch... Bonus! We'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"OMG!! Haven't been here in over 3 years and it's still over the top delish!!  Kudos!! Thank u Odi excellent service and recommendations!!"}
{"text":"Not worth it. Portions are tiny, have to order twice, most of their rolls have 'Cajun' rub, not many choices for the price they offer.  Our server was okay but alittle off. I first ordered gyoza and after getting everything we ordered I told him I never got my gyoza his response was, \"I never heard u say that\" clearly my girl friend I came with heard me and so I said ok can I get an order he walks away. Then we ask to order more, we put an order in for two more rolls, waited 10 mins he comes back and asks if we wanna order dessert so we order that and he brings them over so me and my friend look at each other confused bc we ordered two more rolls and he clearly didn't put that order in so we just paid and left. Totally by wort it and I recommend trying to ignore that server never even got his name!  Yama on flamingo and Maryland is the best ayce sushi too bad they don't stay open late or we would of gone there!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for new late night spots to try in Vegas because I usually eat dinner here around 11 or 12, so I decided to give this one a shot. I especially love a good late night happy hour, but here it's only with the sake, not the food.  Great service, the chefs were really friendly and always checking to make sure if we needed anything. But the food (in terms of good sushi and authentic Japanese) was mediocre. It's one of those Americanized places where spicy tuna, fried California roll, and yum yum sauce are dominant on the menu and where most of the cut rolls taste the same because its all different variations of the same ingredients. I ordered their white tuna sushi and sunomono salad as well. White tuna was decent and sunomono was something errr else...cucumber was shredded thin, not sliced thin and they put a sesame peanut sauce on it instead of the usual rice vinegar. Let's just say I didn't finish it and I'm one not to waste food unless it's truly unappetizing."}
{"text":"I didn't get a very good first impression from this restaurant. Without diverting too much from the food, I would just like to say that there are a few unhappy people employed here, and it shows. It was pretty apparent that there is a lot of internal politics going on at this place. It made me feel very uncomfortable as a patron.... Aside from that, this place has decent food, a great selection of rolls, sushi and sashimi.      I counted forty signature rolls on there menu. My friend who visits the place frequently, suggested the \"High Roller.\" It did not disappoint. The screaming sauce had a small bite to it. The \"Nuclear Bomb\" was my favorite of the night. The crunch flakes (I think it was coconut) gave the roll a great taste! I was feeling a little brave so I also ordered the Sea urchin with quail egg. It didn't look very appealing, but it wasn't gross either. Come to think of it, it didn't have much flavor at all. It tasted like a sunny side up egg with some cold fish inside.      The service was okay. It started off pretty shaky, but the waiter opened up to us later in the night. I think he was having a bad day. The place is pretty clean and modern. They have plenty of adult drinks to choose from, along with a small bar near the entrance."}
{"text":"Fat pieces of fish on the nigiri, the ratio and freshness beats all of the other sushi joints I've tried out here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I received FOOD POISONING from them. I recommended no one pays a visit here because the next day will not be pleasant."}
{"text":"I've never visited Oishi Sushi. This review is based on a delivery order.  To say I was underwhelmed is a such an understatement, it's almost a lie. First, the sushi. Sushi is about rice first, and this rice was NOT sushi rice. It was unflavored and didn't hold together. The sushi pieces were impossible to pick up in one piece, not even with your hand, and the rice completely fell apart if any soy sauce hit it. As far as the fish, the halibut was meh, and the tuna was bait food; sinewy and more gray in color than red. The gyoza were over cooked, room temperature and dried out, like they'd been cooked yesterday and heated under a heat lamp. And the miso soup with clams was  just watery, with barely a hint of miso. The clams in the soup were okay, but sparse.  Isn't pretty standard for a Japanese restaurant to provide soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger with delivery orders? We got bupkus. I was surprised that they supplied chopsticks, the only thing this establishment did right!  I'm sure that most of the restaurants that contract with a delivery service aim to get return business and lure customers to visit their physical location. That concept seems to have been utterly side-stepped by Oishi Sushi. There are certainly two people here who will go out of their way to avoid this establishment. You simply can't slap some poor quality fish on some stale rice, most likely cooked in a rice cooker the day before, and call it sushi.  I'm usually pretty forgiving, but this meal, for thirty plus dollars, was the biggest disappointment and waste of money that I've had in a long time. The only thing acceptable was the quality of their waribashi (the disposable chopsticks)."}
{"text":"Oyshiii! It means yummy or tasty in Japanese. This place does makes some pretty good food that makes me say that though. I live about 5 minutes away so I'm always glad to support my neighborhood businesses. But this place is really worth my time and money. I really like their ayce menu as they always have specials. I love the salmon toro for example and sometimes they do a yellowtail special as well which is worth trying.   They also have a number of great apps, like baked mussels or surf and turf skillet, that are ayce, and my mom loves them.   I also like that, unlike some of the other popular ayce sushi places in the area, the wait here is never crazy. If you come here on a regular weekend night, it shouldn't be anything more than 10-15 min wait.   Lastly, if you have a small party, sit at the bar as you can order half rolls to try out more things on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is poppin on a Saturday night!  We won out last game for the day and wanted to celebrate as a team.   I'll be hella honest, I wanted to hit that plant based fast food spot around the way. But being the team player (haha get it?) that I am I went along with the plan.  We ate in one of the back rooms that we actually had to customize the tables/set up ourselves because there were a grip of Samoans in a small room haha  My table did not pick the AYCE option but I got a few veggie rolls and the yakisoba which I did not care for but the rolls were really tasty and fresh!  The service was on point. They were bringing rolls out left and right. There were about 4 folks serving us and they were super chill.  One even participated in our mannequin challenge haha"}
{"text":"Amazing service from Kenny! Very friendly & funny. Treat Us very well! Thank you so much for your outstanding service! I will come back & definitely ask for Kenny as my server! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Today was my second time visiting this sushi place. First time I was there, I wasn't too impressed. But I came back again today, and oh boy.. I completely changed my mind about this place.  My family and I had shrimp tempura, baked mussels, heart attack roll, salmon roll, california roll, oyshi roll, lasagna roll, yellowtail nigiri, salmon nigiri, white tuna nigiri, and the vegas roll. Everything that we ordered was completely delicious. I really appreciated that the sashimi slices for their nigiri were generously thick. The fish to rice ratio of the nigiri was perfect. Not too much rice.  Only reason why I gave it a 4 is because the service was kind of eh. And I really didn't like how my 3-year-old was $16 for AYCE. My daughter doesn't even eat much sushi at all. I like sushi places that have children 5 & under free. So those two would be my only reasons as to why they don't receive 5 stars.   Minus the cons, I think this place is a very decent place to eat sushi. I would go back. Not often, but if I'm ever in this side of town & craving some sushi.. I'll definitely stop by."}
{"text":"$26/per person for all-you-can-eat dinner sushi. Excellent service. Great tuna poke, seaweed salad and the Tiger Roll here is the best I've had yet. I also recommend the Pink Lady. I never had tried this before, but it was ahi tuna, cooked shrimp wrapped in pink soy paper. Delicious! The only complaint my friend made is that desert is limited to one item only. Boo!"}
{"text":"Oyshi was my first AYCE experience here in Vegas.  At first I thought it was one of the better AYCE sushi places in Vegas but lately it has gone down hill. Case in point my last visit.  We had a party of 6, waited about 15 minutes to be seated.  I've been here when it has been busy and tonight it wasn't that BUSY. We made our first round of orders and waited, waited some more and waited.  It was a good 25 minutes before we got our first round.  We didn't receive our complete order, I just said eh never mind. We ordered some more, and I ordered some Uni and oysters for our group. Again we waited, and waited again. We got the rest of our FIRST order and got some of the second but no uni or oysters. So I ordered some nigiri to hold me over until the uni and oysters came. My nigiri came but not the other items, finally the oysters came but no uni, i asked our server where is the uni and i she tells me 'oh, we ran out'. I was like WTF! Shouldn't you know that information before I ordered it or at least kept me updated. At this point some of my party was clearly upset and just ordered dessert but guess what? They were OUT of some the dessert items too!   This last visit was VERY bad, I hope they improve cause I like this place a lot because they offer different items from other AYCE.  FYI: The table next to us, got up and left and never paid, I think it was due to the poor service they got.  I'll be back, MAYBE"}
{"text":"This place was initially introduced and highly recommended to us by a friendly bartender from the Silverton Casino.  He informed us that this place was a spin-off of Sushi Factory (in Las Vegas).  It's a bit out of the way from \"The Strip\", but if you have the time it's well worth it.  Anyway, after a horrible experience at Sushi Factory (see my review) several months ago, my buddies and I decided to give Oyshi a go.  We couldn't have been any happier with our visit to Oyshi.  Our server (Justin) was very friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  As for the food, the sashimi was fresh, the rolls were tasty, the ambiance was comfortable, simple and modern.  By the way, the Ama ebi (sweet shrimp) and Uni (sea urchin) were both very fresh and delicious.  However, I was bummed that each customer was limited to one order of Ama ebi and Uni per customer.  But being that both are very expensive items, one can understand.  If you're looking for a great, affordable sushi dinner in the Las Vegas area, look no further than Oyshi.  I hope they keep up the good service, and not falter like that of Sushi Factory."}
{"text":"Oyshi has a delicious and extensive ayce menu, there is no doubt about that. Many of the items are interesting and full of flavor. Some of my favorite items are the Love Affair and Japanese Lasagna rolls as well as the beef wrapped asparagus and sizzling ribeye. The quality and creativity of their menu items deserves praise. For example, the cucumber salad isn't the typical you would get at another sushi spot, they have a peanuty sauce laid on top that really individualizes it from the standard version of the dish. All that being said, I still would not say that dinner there should be several dollars higher than other ayce sushi places.   First of all, the service at Oyshi stinks, to put it plainly. Don't get me wrong, the staff is pleasant and at times can even be friendly. However, the food just comes out way too slowly. Other sushi restaurants really leave Oyshi crying in the dust when it comes to this. On top of that, they definitely pull the \"always filling up your drink\" technique to get us full. This just doesn't give your party a lot of room to appreciate all of the items they offer simply because your appetite duration can only hold out for so long.  Secondly, the dessert choices are outstanding, BUT you are limited to one special dessert! Their desserts are the best I've seen so far at a sushi place, but oh my goodness, for $26 dinners, I personally think we should be allowed to try them all one time each, at the very least! I am in love with the green tea tiramisu and the green tea crème brûlée. The fruit parfait is also very tasty, anything but disappointing.  For these reasons, I award Oyshi three stars. Their food makes them a great establishment, but I strongly feel they need cater better to the customers."}
{"text":"UPDATE: 5-28-08: Went back 4 times since review every time was awesome. We even had the AYCE at a table instead of the sushi bar and the service was great. Before our rolls were done our server got our next order. This place impresses me every time."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!! If you love AYCE this is definitely the spot to indulge in different types of sushi! HUGE shoutout to Stefan for the great service and his recommendations on what to choose. We truly enjoyed our experience and plan to come back soon!  -Ced"}
{"text":"Super disappointed. On my previous trip to Oyshi, I thought it was decent sushi and service. However today's trip to Oyshi was a super disappointment. The hostess was no where to be seen, so we had to wait 20 minutes before someone even noticed we were there. We finally got seated, got out drinks, and ordered our first selection for the all you can eat sushi. However, we had to wait 35 minutes until even just our appettizer of the small surf and turf came out. After that it seemed like we were invisible to the waiters before we even got one to awknowledge that they were having staffing problems and that we should wait another 15 minutes for our sushi to come out. When we finally got the sushi it was horribly made and cold (we ordered a baked sushi). I happened to order calamari for my 2nd selection after finishing the 1st. That never came. After being ignored for a few more minutes another waitress came by to see if we would like anything, I was already super pissed by that time so I just ordered a dessert and asked for the check. The $26 for a dinner all you can eat sushi was not worth it. So sad that this place did not meet up to my expectations"}
{"text":"Great fast service from Marcos! Stopped by for lunch, extensive all you can eat menu selection!"}
{"text":"Everything from the service to the quality and presentation I was very satisfied ,  will be returning   Price for ayce  was 27 for dinner  23 for lunch"}
{"text":"I love the AYCE here the variety is great. Dynamite is good...lobster fair...the sizzling appetizers, like surf and turf. The sake is reasonably priced and does its job ha ha and who doesn't love dessert? I had a berry parfait and créeme brûlée and they were delicious!! On top of it all, it was an amazing value"}
{"text":"great deal for all you can eat!!! 21 bucks for adults and 15 for kids. i treated myself and my cousins to a lunch before taking the red eye back to nyc.  i wasn't sure if we were going to be able to eat a lot but we sure ate more than we paid for! everything in the menu was included except for sashimi (easy fix: order it sushi style and don't eat the rice), uni and ebi.  we had gyoza, edamame, seaweed salad,  seven rolls (from regular spicy tuna and alaska rolls to specialty ones including a spider, baked rolls, and a deep fried philly), two hand rolls, two orders of tako nigiri, two orders of hamachi nigiri, an order of tamago, and green tea ice cream for dessert.  i'd say we did a but of damage at this joint! what i also liked was that our waitress was recommending specialties to get and told us that appetizers and dessert were included. she was also helpful when my cousin wanted green tea ice cream and parfait by combining the two together. it was pretty much the green tea ice cream instead of vanilla yogurt with fruit and whipped cream on top. what a way to end a great meal!"}
{"text":"Well I just ate at Oyshi an hour ago and this is my experience with them. First off I should have known better to eat there when I realized me and my friend were the only Asians in the restaraunt. If you are a Expert Sushi eater you would do well to stay away from Oyshi. The Sushi Rice was horrid. It was not cooked all the way and they pack the rice way too tight. I never got three things I ordered by the time I left which was such a turn off.  Some of the Nigiri was decent however some of it tasted not so fresh. The back of my throat was itching from their fish as I am very sensitive to bad fish. The server was super sweet however she was not attentive what so ever.       My child ordered the Teryaki kids meal and the first thing she said when I asked her how is it was my chicken is dry with no flavor so I had them take it back.      They do not understand how to make rolls there. I ordered the spicy tuna which was the worse spicy tuna. They had no cucumber in any rolls which that texture was missing from every roll. I do not think they understand the proper way to make sushi.     Discouraged from the sushi I tried to order some apps to get my moneys worth.... Bad idea the salad ...bad! The Calamri was the same frozen tiny dried over cooked calamari served at other pizza bistros. The sizzling rib eye was over cooked and dry and flavorless. The mussels had a garlic soy mayo sauce which was super salty and made the mussels super rich.      This place seems to be more for those who really do not know what good sushi is. If you were raised eating sushi then I would stay far away from Oyshi.  They seem concerned when they notice a customer is unhappy yet management or the servers do nothing to ammend the situation.     I ordered Sea Urchin, sunrise roll, white tuna, salmon, garlic tuna and a few other rolls and Nigiri. The only thing I liked or enjoyed was my water with lemon.     Now all I am thinking about is the money I wasted there. I have never been so displeased ergo why I tweeted to my 16 Thousand Followers that they should never eat at Oyshi .. HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"What can I say...ALL YOU CAN EAT Sushi...its great!  Great kitchen items too.  Service was good, and the California and California-based rolls were out of the world delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing! My mother in law, sister in law & I stayed in the area cause we had rented an air bnb for Memorial Day weekend and we were beyond happy we found this place. We were more sad we couldn't bring them back with us to California. The attention and the food were seriously spectacular! And the all you can eat had such a big variety that I didn't know what to do with my life. I seriously cannot wait to be back. Much love from California!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this place and I was very pleasantly surprised.  We did have to wait a minute for a table during lunch but it was worth it. The amount of food for the price was great.  I got the teriyaki sizzling chicken platter and it was more than enough.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Wide variety of rolls and appetizers. Pretty good, BUT...some of slowest service I've ever received at a sushi joint. I heard so many good things about this place and with the service alone...I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"All you can eat style dining but what makes this place nice is the decor and friendly staff. Worth the wait for a table at 6:30 pm Sunday September 1st, 2013. $26 AYCE."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in town! I love the array of delicious rolls they offer and the rib eye. Not to mention the appetizing green tea berry parfait. I highly recommend, and be sure to do AYCE."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill in a major way. It used to be good. I wonder if it's under new management or ownership.  The salmon nigiri was fresh, but everything else was just downright nasty. How do you mess up rolls that contain imitation crab? Which, by the way, a majority of the rolls contain. The imitation crab was mushy and sweet. The rolls were 7 day-old grocery store quality. I'm talking about Albertson's quality. The rolls at Whole Foods are way better than Oyshi's. Also, the rolls were loaded with way too much rice. I know that ayce places love to fill you up with rice, but this was ridiculous. Why have rolls called the yum yum scallop that contains one tiny sliver of scallop, or a lobster fair roll that has no lobster in it?  This was a waste of $72 for two people."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in town. We eat here (and order to go) very frequently. They have really fresh fish and some interesting combinations. My favorite roll is the screaming roll, with shrimp tempura, cajun albacore, avocado and ponzu sauce. Yum! Their dinners are great, like the sukiyaki, rib-eye teriyaki and asian style skirt steak. Also love their appetizers, like popcorn scallops and calamari tempura."}
{"text":"The sushi was great the service was lacking. The two star is for the service not the sushi. I ordered several rolls with ayce and didn't ever receive a couple of the ordered rolls. Not sure what is going on here I used to think this place was great."}
{"text":"The service has been decent,  food has been decent as well.  I just wish they offered 1/2 order options for sushi /rolls.  Also, the happy hour time and offers could definitely be better and more expansive as far as time offered and selections are concerned."}
{"text":"i like here so much . good service and good food. very fresh. sever is very nice. i like here's dessert too."}
{"text":"It's pretty decent, not that I had high expectations for it. It's my first time just now because I had heard bad things about it a long time ago (quality of fish mostly).   There's nothing special, in my opinion, but my friend wanted to come to try one of their desserts (IKR?).   They only allow you to pick one dessert item (not including unlimited ice cream, though). Another friend stated when they came before they didn't have this restriction. Well, looks like it was just mochi ice cream for me then, which comes only in strawberry, by the way.   They have some daily specials so check out that list on the way to your table. Fish wasn't as shabby as anticipated so that was a plus. I love salmon nigiri but theirs wasn't too good, actually. So I definitely ate less than usual in that department.   In terms of hot tea, they charge you $2.50 for the pot at the table so I'm thankful it wasn't $2.50 per person :).   Overall, it's pretty much a just as expected / average place for me. In this area, it's not my to-go place for ayce sushi but hey, this visit just means I won't say no if another friend wants to eat here. :0)"}
{"text":"Went here last Friday to celebrate \"Treat yo Self\" day (if you watch parks and Rec you know what I'm talking about) & it was pretty good. They're all you can eat dinner was just about $30. I believe it was $28 something. It wasn't bad. The service was pretty prompt and the restaurant was clean and very \"organized\". I liked it. It was small, but had a very modern and cozy feel. The menu wasn't that expansive per say when it came to the variety of rolls. Maybe it's just me. I look for certain key \"trigger\" words and nothin jumped it at me. I did order the snow mountain and the Japanese garlic lasagna roll which were pretty good. Also ordered the baked mussels which are MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE THING. The thing I didn't like was they have limits on certain apps like the oysters and the mussels. Kind of a buzzkill. Overall I can't complain too much, but the place just didn't wow me. If I had the option to go out for sushi again. I'd go to the nearby \"Sushi House Goyemon\" instead. No limit on mussels, lots of roll variety, and tempura ice cream !"}
{"text":"Our friend took us here when we visited toronto and the big salmon dome made with rice seemed to be the hype. Very creative and pretty tasty but i was a little put off by the flies around the place. The lunch came with a soup and salad so we were full from the portion."}
{"text":"I was surprised. I was surprised I liked this place, but I did. Maybe I was just lucky today. Came here for the first time and ordered lunch combo 5, dynamite and sake sushi, thanks to my companion.  I didn't care too much for the sake sushi, but the dynamite was good. I mean above average thanks to the delicious rice. It doesn't look like much, but it is quite a bit as I was filled up quite quickly. I enjoyed the hot tea too on the cold Toronto day. The only thing is the wasabi and ginger seemed packaged sushi standard, if only it was a bit better, I would have, might have, really loved this place. It is quaint and cozy after all."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place!  Wonderful selection of rolls, appetizers, and their AYCE sushi is well worth it! I am allergic to most fish but can eat tuna, unagi, and all shellfish. They were accommodating to my allergies and they still had a great variety of rolls and appetizers that I could eat. I love the Ginza roll and my boyfriend is a fan of the Love Affair (baked lobster roll). The creme brulee was delicious! We have eaten here about 4 times and have enjoyed it every time."}
{"text":"We've been going to this restaurant for nearly 6 years now and since the end of last year (2017), it seems to be going down hill fast. It used to be the place that all of our out of town guests were excited to eat at when they visited and that my wife and I had date nights at (literally hundreds of times). Not anymore. It seems as if there was a change in ownership or management because the service has been slow at best most recently and down right unacceptable the rest of the times with 45-55 minutes before some of our party's food even arrived. We've been 3 times in the past month trying to give it one more chance way too many times and out of those 3 times, my wife and I got sick the last two (not making the connection that it was the sushi that got us sick the time previous). This is it for us. No more chances when our health is in question.  If anyone has any recommendations for a good AYCE sushi restaurant on the southwest side of town, please share it with me! We're trying to figure out where we'll go for sushi from now on."}
{"text":"Yummy! Love this place but you can not get in for dinner without waiting. This place needs to expand or get a bigger space because a wait on a Tuesday night is not cool! Their food is really good and their portion sizes are good. Prices are fair, staff is nice, and restaurant has a nice contemporary atmosphere. The best time to go is lunch and they have some great lunch specials and menu. I love living close and being able to grab some food to go."}
{"text":"I am actually quite shocked as to how low the yelp review for this place was.   My boyfriend suggested it to me as one of his friends had taken him there the day before.   I completely forgot to check in on yelp so after we ordered I looked and got pretty scared of the low rating.   Well it's off that's for sure.   I actually really liked this place.   A lot.    The menu has a good variety of items.   The specials were interesting (and written on the wall very nicely.)  Out of all the items we ordered (believe me there are more than what is pictured here.   Lol!), the only ones I actually did not care for were the sunamono (there seemed to be some weird peanut butter or sesame paste thing on top) and the green tea tiramisu (was oily and flavorless to me.)  The other amazing thing about this place was Judy.   Probably the best server I've had in a long time (including any fine dining this past year.)  She was super attentive and seemed to really care about her job.   Definitely might make this place my new sushi joint..."}
{"text":"This is the best AYCE sushi in Vegas! We always come here for a great time and good eats!! The sushi chefs are amazing!!"}
{"text":"One of my go to sushi spots for all you can eat especially since it's so close to my job and I go here for my breaks. I've never had any problems with going here , it's usually slow and somewhat empty when I come here. Service is usually good, although the last time I went we finished our plates and our server took so long to come back and was no where to be found until when she finally came back and we just ended up getting our check and left. But other than that experience, thumbs up to this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  And Nacho just created the best new rolls I've ever had! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi. My wife prefers baked rolls and they have a great selection for her. I like it all and the all you can eat rocks!  Plus there are private rooms for parties. We have held a few larger birthday dinners there with great success!"}
{"text":"Atlas my favorite sushi place in Las Vegas!  Unfortunately I'm unable to rate them a full 5 star due to their slowness on delivering plates. My group definitely has to order a lot of sushi at once to compensate for the wait time in between orders.  The environment is amazing. It's definitely the most up to date sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. I'm judging by the actual wall decor to the house music played.  My favorite dish would have to be A Lobster Affair. If you don't have a shellfish allergy give this dish a try."}
{"text":"By far the worst service I have received in a while. Literally waited an hour for an appetizer. Basically wasted time and money . Whenever we made an order we would wait FORVER for it to make our table. Not to mention half of our orders didn't make it to our table! We ended up asking for our check and what was funny is that the manager brought out the rest of our food. Seriously??? Yea total waste of $70!"}
{"text":"Horrible service... They make guests wait while they have open tables. This is the third time I have come here and it's the same story every time. Rude hostess, no customer service. I will never come back to this oyshi. If I could rate them a zero I would."}
{"text":"I used to love this place and the food is good but the service was problem. We waited and hour for our first order and then never saw a server for another hour. We decided to pay for what we ate and leave the I had a associate come out and start cussing me out. Worst dining experience ever."}
{"text":"This place is near my work, so we had a couple of team lunches here. It is a small family restaurant, so we need to make reservations for our large team. The lunch here is considered reasonable price in downtown habourfront area. The food is good quality. The portion is also large. For around 15, you are going to have a good sushi lunch. The waitress is pretty friendly. Anyway, a good place for team lunch."}
{"text":"I get why they have four stars, it's a hip place with electronica music playing in the background, and that seems to be a Vegas standard now.  However, I can't say ill be making my way back.  They have a variety to choose from for AYCE, with the whole inside menu strictly rolls.  When I do AYCE, I only go for nigiri.  As I've posted before, I'm not really into rolls because its usually covered in sauce, with very little filling.  I guess it's what Americans love though... Sauce on everything.  I'm guilty as well, just not on my sushi.  Anyway, the fish was really poor quality.  After my initial order, I couldn't bring myself to order any more.  I love my fish to taste like fish (if that even makes sense).  The fish here had no taste whatsoever.  All I could taste was the vinegar from the rice.  I thought it was cool they served oysters, but it was pretty blah.  There was no flavor at all.  It tasted like water.  It did not have that \"taste like the sea\" quality.  I don't know.  It just didn't taste like anything.  The baked mussels were not very good. Overcooked. No flavor.  Too chewy.  Tofu was ok, but too much sauce, and it was overly sweet.  Desserts were boring.  No green tea ice cream. Creme brûlée was ok.  Ice cream parfait was ok.  Seriously, this place is lacking all types of flavors.  I like the fact that they serve \"fresh\" scallops, other places usually have the baby scallops drenched in yum yum sauce.    Server was friendly.    I'd pass on this place and go for Goymen, Sushi Komo, or even Kaya."}
{"text":"Introduced by a friend was very impressed. Came back a second time this time I bought friends we ate in VIP room it was dirty. But food still great. At the end I ordered 2 rolls to go for my friend who intro me to this spot cause he couldn't make it. I brought them to his store after dinner and left he texted me to ask what they were cause it was not what he ordered. We called oyshi manager Kevin and he told us he would take care of us next time. So a few days later (visit 3 in less then 10 days) we went again. This time my friend who intro the place made it. When we were done we asked for Kevin again the five of us ate ayces. My two boys both under 3 did not eat. Again we were in VIP room.  Kevin came up and we reminded him of our wrong roll order and the 22 buck credit we had. He said what rolls would you like to take home? We said none the guy we ordered them for is here and we ate enough fish tonight. He said well I'm not taking off check next time you do want rolls to go I will take care of you. Then the check came 18% gratuity for 5 people....... We paid it cause it was 24 dollars but the server actually screwed himself out of a bigger tip.  The service also sucked.. Hour for our first round of rolls to show to the table. It's fresh it's good. It will be closed soon if their attitudes don't change."}
{"text":"Chef Ed was our sushi chef tonite! He made our experience amazing! We will come back just to see him!"}
{"text":"Oyshi, well what can I say. It is an all you can eat sushi place that is run by Koreans. The decor is very modern and there are several water sculptures that is placed around the restaurant. They also have private rooms and large Plasma tvs that will show a basketball game or two. I was introduced to this sushi place by a friend of mines and went for the first time a couple of months ago. I have to say their appetizer menu is, by far, superior to all AYCE sushi places. Their surf and turf has this sweet and tangy sauce, it is served over a bed of shredded greens with steak and shrimp on a hot plate that is sizzling as it arrives. Their oysters are fairly good served with a bit of chili sauce and you can have max of 4. I have gone back to Oyshi about 3 times and this review is a collective of all the times I dined there. The first time I dined I ordered some salmon, tuna, yellowtail, nigiri. I was very very impressed with the quality and ratio of rice to fish. I asked the waiter what he would recommend as it was my first time dining there and he immediately chirped \"love affair\" you must have it. It was very very good. I do have to say it took them over 20 minutes to bring out my order of nigiri and even longer for the love affair roll. There were probably 10 people dining there. I was kind of confused as a couple that came after us got their roll first. I am normally a service junkie and if I don't get it I usually don't ever step back into the restaurant. This restaurant seemed like a place that deserved a second chance. I went another time with a group of 9 and were sat in a semi private area where the wall had a huge mural that seemed hand painted. We were seated and they took our orders. The wait wasn't as painful this time as they brought out the food fairly quickly. Once again, the love affair roll and my classic salmon, tuna and yellowtail nigiri were wonderful. The third time I went was pretty similar to the first time I dined here. The service was subpar and their food seemed to lack flavor. I have to say if their service was at par with how their decor is I would probably have given a higher rating, but without good service the clients will never return. Maybe they deserve another chance? I have to wait and see."}
{"text":"My first time experience here wasn't the best, don't get me wrong the sushi was good. Just had bad service. But the waiter was disappointing, the food came to us late, all I know is that I felt like the hospitality wasn't there. Left knowing I didn't wanna come here again. First & last timer for sure."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years...unfortunately a good place is not so good anymore. Went to dinner had the all you can eat. The Gyoza n shrimp tempura were good bc you can't mess up fried stuff. The ribeye app was tasteless n not even sizzling when it came out. The sushi was sooo disappointing. Not fresh at all.....The sushi rice was obviously pre-made (main inside rolls w/ the crab n sushi rice that comes under the fish) meaning that they mass produce the main parts of the sushi- refrigerate it and then just added the fish and toppings after the fact. The rice was sooo cold that when you were eating it, it felt like you were eating ice cream with warm sushi toppings. I know this place is busy but when a place moves in that direction to get people in n out not good;(  Very sad that this restaurant is cutting corners like that, especially with sushi. I rather go to an a la carte place and get my sushi made and rolled fresh."}
{"text":"This place is a delicious all you can eat sushi joint. The variety is good, the quality is good, the service is good, and the price is relative to any other all you can eat sushi place. I have come here multiple times, and I will continue to."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi... Who's idea was this?   I came, I all-you-can-eated, I left in a near coma!   Good sushi, I think it was like $26 for the all you can eat, comes with sushi, or hot food items (ie gyoza and such), you order from the server, they make it, bring it out, rinse repeat!   Standard dinning room, sushi bar, or they have a couple of side rooms if you want to roll out here with a group of people or have a party and such here!"}
{"text":"Sitting next to the head chief and his family. Sweet, he has given us a guided tour of the menu. No time limit on AYCE! Love the sashimi it came on a platter with salmon, albacore, tuna and yellowtail belly\" not on AYCE\" melt in your mouth delicious. Pictures of AYCE food and desert included in all you can eat.   I trust your dinning experience will as great without Ryan Akagi Head Sushi chief leans over see you Yelping and introduces himself & family and recommends his personal favorites. Vegas is all about personal service Jamie and the staff provided in readable service.   He works at the one on Rainbow but lives close to Sahara. In on this day off that is know the fish is fresh and the atmosphere is mellow."}
{"text":"Only reason they don't get a zero stars is because there is no option for it... Manager and chefs are horrible.. Ordered a salmon and avocado roll as well as seared tuna.. The salmon avocado had minimal to no avocado in it.. And the tuna was regular not seared Some of the pieces you couldn't even see the avocado in it.  We sent it back and witnessed one of the sushi chefs argue with his manager insisting he wouldn't remake it.. After like 5 more minutes of arguing with his manager in front of customers he reluctantly remade the roll but then proceeded to stare me and my date down from behind the counter.  Naturally I had had enough and summoned the manager.  Manager seemed more bothered than actually concerned on making it right and made no effort. He pretty much stood up for the chef that had previously been arguing with him.  He said that managers arguing with their employees is \"typical restaurant environment\" This is a complete disappointment as we are regular oyshi 1 customers, the other location and service and food is great."}
{"text":"For people looking for variety, not so much into the raw fish part of sushi, this place has a lot of variety and their offerings are pretty good.   But for the sushi purist and sushi snob it's a no go. The fish is not at its freshest/finest compared to other places, most of their rolls are stuffed full of imitation crab, and the rice is pretty inconsistent across chefs, getting bigger with the more you order.   Their deserts are more unique than other places and pretty good. The parfait was the best out of the brulees and tiramisu that we tried among their offerings.   No complaints about the service this day."}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant at least two time a week in the past and since my last encounter I will no longer be going back nor recommend it to anyone. I called in for a pick up order and after realizing I made a mistake I called back. When the guy on the phone answered he put me on hold and decided at least 10 minutes of my time deserves to be wasted. I hung up and called again he answered and when I asked if he fixed my order so they don't make extra he said he was \"very busy\" and hung up on me. I called yet again this time to cancel my order where I was hung up on AGAIN. By this time I'm clearly upset I called and this time a woman answered she said no manager was on duty and that she was going to give my number to the manager. NO ONE reached out or called. I will not do business where it is not appreciated. The management obviously doesn't care how their staff take care of regulars and the staff has no manners. I've put up with mistakes here and there and never complained but the level of disrespect this last time will not be forgiven.   Any other location will be better if you enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Sushi is good but the service is terrible. Especially when you have a personal training without a trainer. Ordered all you can eat and had a few questions about items on the menu and our waitress had no idea what I was talking about. Then I ordered a few items that never came out or sides like jalapeños that showed up after we're done eating. We were a party of 2 and we ordered 4 rolls and 3 orders of sushi our quick dinner turned in to a 2 hour total ordeal."}
{"text":"Mmmm yummy Oyshi sushi oh how we adore our monthly AYCE visits! My sweet cheeks and I really enjoy coming here as part as our dining out rotation as it is always a real treat.  We always sit at the bar in the back corner as it is cozy and has a great view of the flat screen TV on the wall that always has the latest sports game playing.   We have our favorite rolls and this time we enjoyed a new appetizer that was really good. The popcorn scallops was a yummy appetizer we tried which came with a honey mustard and a spicy ranch dipping sauce.   What we really like about Oyshi is the consistency in service and food quality. We have never really been disappointed with a visit, it is an easy and happy relationship we have with Oyshi.  I really enjoy the flavors of the Oyshi roll and the Lobster Affair which both melt in my mouth. My lover boy likes the spicy rolls such as the nuclear bomb and the atomic roll. He loves anything that is spicy and that has jalapeno in it  When I want a satisfying mouth orgasm this is where I go to get it over and over and over again.  I like mouth orgasms caused by Amazing flavors exploding in my mouth!"}
{"text":"As always Oyshi Sushi never disappoints! My gal pal fellow Yelper HeatherS. and I decided to try this new location that is closer to our side of town.  The staff is Awesome and the food is always on point! We of course had the AYCE and it was just as Amazing as their other location that I used to frequent.  This location is cute, dark, sexy and romantic with a fun club vibe with music playing in the background.  We enjoyed the, screaming orgasm, lobster affair, love affair, Hawaiian roll, fried scallops, gyoza, poke, sweet shrimp and shrimp tempura. I really enjoyed the New York style cheesecake and Heather enjoyed her green tea ice cream for dessert.   We ordered iced tea and were brought a nice carafe for refills.  Oyshi is the best, I am truly spoiled every time I visit and this new location is just as fantastic as the one on rainbow."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Always loved the one on Rainbow but this location on Sahara opened not too long ago and the interior is so modern & edgy, great music too! Hot tamale roll will always be my favorite to order haha, I don't know any other sushi places who make that roll so.. Oyshi is my #1 sushi place in town.  Enjoy your food!"}
{"text":"Just had a great experience with the server Golden. Funny, knowledgeable, and he got all the order correct. It wasn't my first time here, but he's always been the best. Water was filled, food was correct, and he made me laugh. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego and when I heard \"ALL YOU CAN EAT\" sushi -- I had to try this out. My family and I had lunch here and It blew me away. The decor was gorgeous and modern and for $21 dollars for all you can eat sushi plus sweets!   Went here on the weekend and there was a good amount of people dining. The sushi was good and I even tasted some sushi that I wouldn't normally try back home. Because of the \"all you can eat deal\", I took advantage of that. As we ordered it took a bout a couple of minutes for our food to come out.   I gave this place 3 stars because our waitress Vivian had forgotten some of our food. The food was good and I wanted to try as much as I could, I got too excited.. but when you forget an order, it bums customers out. She did apologize.   I would like to come back again and try more of the food here, just hopefully they wont forget our order :)"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. I thought it was off the charts and I always referred people to here but about two weeks ago, me and my hubby ate here for dinner and I got food poisoning. I missed a whole day of work the next day because I could not get out of bed. The service has gone down hill too. When ordering off the AYCE menu, you wait 15-20 minutes sometimes to get your food. They're not slammed... What's taking so long? We often sit there and wonder if they forgot about us. We used to eat here at least twice a month and I told my hubby the other day that it's just going to have to be put on the back burner for now. No more Oyshi for a while."}
{"text":"Super disappointing... We come here often and while I understand it's Valentine's and everyone is busy but I don't get the the roll orders. I've seen plenty of tables get 10+ rolled while all we got was our drinks in 50 min... we placed a second order 30 min in since it was busy and somehow got that roll before our main order.  Figure out your order process... when the hostess comes back to me and tells me the chef says the order is out and we have nothing our table.. that is not service.   ***updated from 1 star to 4  After our waitress Toni was super nice and explained what issue was I can't blame her. But I do feel like the kitchen chefs ruined our Valentine's Day with the disorder and chaos."}
{"text":"Perfect and sushi are hard to put together. But Oyshi does a valiant job at striving for it.  Our hostess was mediocre. As the face of the business her attitude and manners said \"We could give a crap less.\" Not the image any business wants to exude.  Our server Vangie saved the day with her bubbly attitude and her menu suggestions. After some discussion of what we were looking for Vangie recommended the all you can eat.  The expansive selection of the all you can eat menu is worth it. There are some caveats, but they are well worth it.  The only draw back that some may find with the system was half sized sushi rolls, 6 piece, instead of 8 or 10.  The sushi was good, and the other offerings tasty. I would absolutely eat there again, and the price is good for the quality."}
{"text":"I'm just waiting for someone to post pictures of their sick mural so I can go get a life sized tatoo of their samurai looking warrior on my back.   Their private rooms are comfortable and my party of 5 was diggin it Yakuza style watchin the Celtic's/Cav's game while listenin to some Alice DJ in the background.   They have this Korean mouthwash dispenser in the bathroom that probably serves shots of sake/soju or something because that mutha was empty when I tried to hit it up for some mouth smell good.   $21for all you can eat bomb ass sushi rolls! The rolls weren't janky all lopsided and crooked either. The fish was fresh and I know if they had one of these in the bay area that it would be soo popular."}
{"text":"Oyshi means YUMMY in Japanese! The sushi & rolls are delicious. Their fishes are so fresh that you can't even taste the fishiness! BUT! The service has decline over the years. They were great when they first open, now they are slow with everything. It takes at least 20 mins. to get your food. You'll even have to wait for a waiter to come around again just to pay your bill. Definitely give them a try but don't expect anything fast!"}
{"text":"Oyshi is located in a plaza that doesn't have other restaurants so it was pretty empty when we went - Saturday lunch time.  The restaurant interior surprised me. Very modern and comfortable. There are private rooms for larger parties. We were seated in a private room which was perfect since there were kids with us.  AYCE = $21 for lunch, $26 for dinner. You pay the dinner price at lunch if you want oysters, ebi and uni.  Our first round consisted of mostly appetizers. Stand out apps: potato croquette - very nice fried, good flavor baked mussels - plump and covered with creamy sauce that has masago in it shrimp & veggie tempura - good batter and slightly sweeter than normal tempura sauce ahi poke - not a whole lot of fish, but great seasoning on a bed of greens  Appetizers that didn't really wow me: dynamite, spicy sashimi salad, fried calamari  Food came out in a very timely manner and the wait staff were attentive and quick.  Sushi: SALMON BELLY received much praise SPANISH MACKEREL was good but cut sloppily YELLOWTAIL was not buttery but still tasted fresh RED SNAPPER great texture and sweetness UNI TOPPED WITH QUAIL EGG was a bit discolored which concerned me and didn't have too much sea butteriness to it but still enjoyable EBI I passed on because I don't like raw shrimp but seemed okay. I tried to eat the brains but they were very shrimpy  OYSTERS plump and very white. I could've used more lemon or some sort of mignonette though  As for the rolls, they all started to taste the same. Lots of rolls are filled with krab, and topped with fish. The eel & avocado roll was very disappointing because there was too much of the teriyaki type sauce and the avocado was not ripe. Presentation was good, but the actual handiwork of the cuts wasn't that great. The salmon lover and sexy rolls had some sort of buttery yellow sauce drizzled on top that almost made me gag because there was a faint hint of banana to the sauce. I am not a banana fan. Especially not on my sushi.  Freshness: 3/5 Service: 5/5 Would I return? Yes."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in vegas, all you can eat or not.  Great staff, great food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food and people are amazing!! It never a disappointment!! I come atleast once a week. We're spoiled."}
{"text":"We decided to have a surprise birthday party for a friend, and she loves Oyshi!  So we arranged to have dinner in the private room, there was probably about 15 people with our party.  We enjoyed beer and sake, we then ate soooooo much amazing food! Everything was great! The staff was attentive and we all had a great celebration!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Vegas to try Oyshi sushi. I learned about this place from a website called Sushinomads. It had good reviews so I had to plan to go the next time I was in Vegas. We went during lunch AYCE sushi which is not much different from dinners AYCE. I must say that the quality of the food deserves five stars. They offer a lot of interesting styles of rolls and also offer specials of the day that are included in AYCE. My test for all sushi restaurants I go to is the Salmon Skin Handroll. Oyshi passed with flying colors. The salmon skin was crispy. The seaweed was crunchy and not soggy from getting drenched with eel sauce to add flavor. Salmon skin roll is a simple roll but can easily be ruined if not done correctly. Since that turned out well, I was really looking forward to trying the wide selections of rolls that they offered on the menu. You pretty much have the whole menu to choose from including appetizers, salads and desserts for the AYCE. So if it's not just sushi you're craving, the AYCE is still an excellent choice. We will definitely go back to try the many different sushi & rolls we were to full to try."}
{"text":"Alright this is all you need to know: it's a Japanese AYCE restaurant that's not Japanese.   We came here for lunch and did the AYCE menu. For $25ish, its a steal of a deal just based on the cost basis of California style sushi at any other restaurant.  And that my friends, is all we came here for.  If you have read any of my other Japanese restaurant reviews, you know that this is not my cup of tea so please don't unfollow me; the lady wanted to eat Cali style sushi so what the lady wants, the lady gets.   Here is the fat skinny on this place: if you stick to just the sushi rolls, you will be satisfied. Lets do the math: the average price for a Cali style roll at any given sushi joint will run you about $10 so assuming you eat at least 2 rolls, then you will eat your money's worth.  The rolls were decent but nothing spectacular. As mentioned previously I prefer the purist motherland style sushi.   Notable misses for this place: 1. They charge extra for sashimi 2. Most of the cooked food is not very good. The steak did not taste good and the sizzling platter was loaded with onions as fluff.    The gf was happy she got her Japanese lasagna and spider rolls so all in all an -ok dining experience I guess..."}
{"text":"Oyshi Sushi is a pretty good AYCE sushi restaurant located in the SW.  After hearing my coworker praising it, I finally hit up the place with a few Meetup folks from Las Vegas and SoCal.  It is the sister restaurant to Soyo Barestaurant in the same plaza, so yes, this is another Korean owned sushi restaurant with some items that has a more Korean flare/flavor.  The restaurant itself is well-lit and trendily decorated, and attracts a diverse crowd of patrons looking for good AYCE sushi at a reasonable price.  The AYCE menu is practically the entire menu (mostly nigiri and rolls), except the sashimi and if I remembered correctly some salads.  They also have expanded their menu, and the new items are printed on the paper place mats, so don't forget to check those out too.  Plus the numerous options available in the appetizer section is more than adequate to round out the sushi dining experience.  There are three special items (uni, ama ebi and raw oysters) that is limited to one order/pp with AYCE, and the restaurant reserves the right to charge you for the food you don't finish to minimize unnecessary waste (standard rules of the AYCE realm).  I Enjoyed: Sibuya No Rice Roll New Moon Roll Vegas No Rice Roll YumYum Scallop Ama Ebi and the fried shrimp heads Surf n Turf Popcorn Scallops  I Didn't Care For: Japanese Lasagna (topped with way too much mayo that it overwhelmed and masked the flavor profile of the rolls underneath) Asian Style Flank Steak (basically a not so good version of the traditional Korean Bulgogi served on a sizzling plate) Green Tea Tiramisu  Service was good, especially considering that Ted, was our only waiter, and he was looking after our party of 7 plus his other tables.  We were seated in one of the side rooms with really comfortable seats, so it was extra relaxing.  Ambiance: 5/5  Great vibes. Service: 4/5  For a busy night, our service was still great. Food: 4/5  Overall, I think it is pretty good for AYCE. Price: 4.5/5  Very reasonable. Parking: 5/5  Never been a problem finding a parking space when I come to this plaza.  4 Stars!"}
{"text":"Came here after the gym, so the restaurant was actually not too busy when we arrived around 1:30pm. The hostess seated our party of three quickly and our waitress took great care of us.  Did the AYCE option (and upgraded to the dinner option) since it was cheat day for one of our friends so we could ordered items only available for the dinner AYCE price. So we ordered all the dinner only items and the assorted nigiri that we often ordered. Every thing was great. Service from the sushi bar was quick and before long we were almost too stuffed to ordered desserts.  The one thing I have to constantly remember to do when dining at most Korean-operated sushi restaurants is to ask the chef to go easy on the sauce or serve it on the side for all of the specialty rolls. But that is completely a personal preference thing.  Baked Mussels were a good appetizer to start our meal.  Seared Salmon Nigri - yum  Salmon Skin + Fresh Salmon and Ikura Handroll - make sure they put all the ingredients in one hand roll and not make three different ones.  Unagi Nigiri - good, but even better if slightly more caramelized.   A la carte options, Lunch Specials are also available for anyone not in the mood for AYCE."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi spots in town. Their fish is superb and is always fresh. I also like it that they are open late! This is where we go for our sushi fix, it's also not to far from our house.  The service is not that good. So far most servers we've had we're a bit rude. This place gets packed especially by 8pm."}
{"text":"Sad to give a bad review because it started off great. Somewhere after two orders it took 35mins to get someone's attention to make another order and another 20 for someone to tell us they're making it. Our server never came back after he initially got lost, but came back to tell us \"sorry that's the way it works.\" Bullshit. Tried to be understanding seeing as they were shorthanded, but then again the restaurant was only half full and 2 servers and 2 runners walking around. Not our fault they were understaffed. The other sad thing is not everyone in the service industry is taught customer service and it clearly showed here today. Obviously won't be returning even though one of the servers(not ours) tried to repair the situation as much as he could. Too bad because the food was decent albeit it got sloppy as the meal went on."}
{"text":"I go to this place due to its near by location.  It's an all you AYCE Sushi place.  Now you would expect low quality from somewhere like this, but it is actually pretty decent in some respects.  However, it is also lacking in areas.  Pros: The price was the norm for this type of establishment.  The food is good.  I'm not a big time roll eater as I'd rather eat nigiri over some American take on sushi.  The nigiri was of decent quality, not outstanding, but hey, it is the desert after all. The appetizers are great!  Yes you can make a meal out of the appetizers.  The sauce on the surf and turf was outstanding.  The tempura dipping sauce was also great.  Cons:  First of all, this place has gotten very busy.  I used to be able to walk right in, now it can be up to a 45 minute wait.  Once you get in you get the feel that this place is understaffed.  (Update!!!  Staff seems to have increased, speed of orders has improved....some.  Still a packed house.)  The servers come around, yet your order does not.  I came with a group of 7 big time eaters and we put in big orders at a time.  Not only did our orders take forever to come out, but it felt like the manager was watching us to see if we were really eating all that food.  It got to a point that they stopped taking our order.  It says all you can eat on the door buddy.  (Update:  Management does not do that to us anymore, are they reading this?  Great job if they are!)  They didn't even bring out our oysters and claimed that they did and we could not have any more.  I had to explain to the manager that we are not asking for more, we never got any to begin with.  They figured out that our oysters were taken to the wrong table.  Lucky them.  We ended up paying the bill and leaving having not received everything we ordered. They couldn't even take the time to fill a drink.  UPDATE:  The last few times we went we got better service, the rotation of fish is fast, so the flavor has improved.  Still not the fastest, and still a wait to get in, but it's a slamming busy place now.  I have found one big dislike that is totally not the restaurant's fault.  Every time I go there now, there always seems to be the loudest, most obnoxious, cussing, group of trendy punks sitting right next to me.  It's like man, if you've got all this money that you seem to need to yell about so everyone can hear you, why are you at an AYCE sushi place.  Go eat at some rich place where everyone else is yelling about their car and their money.  I don't want to hear you, I want to hear the person sitting next to me."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I had a late lunch here today. The food was great, the service was wonderful & we really enjoyed the fun music. Being new to Las Vegas we've been trying out a lot of different restaurants but I think we found our new regular sushi spot! Thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"This place has always been great when it comes to AYCE. I usually force feed my gullet to get to the green tea creme brûlée. This is by far the best dessert I've had in my entire life. As far as the sushi goes I'm a big fan of the iris roll and garlic tuna. The surf and turf sizzle plate is worth it for sure and iced green tea is to die for. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable which is awesome too."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi place! Loli has some great interpersonal skills and she made our dinner a plus! Will be coming back every time sushi is on our mind. Thank you staff of oyshi!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service wasn't good at all. Drinks never filled and food runner checked on us more than our server ever did."}
{"text":"Terrible. From the moment we walked in no one greeted us or even acknowledged us for a good 5 minutes. As we were about to walk us someone finally came to the desk and sat us. FYI no half sushi orders at tables, so we moved 2 feet over to the bar and it was ok... kinda strange. But what I couldn't deal with was dirty menus & dirty table tops. The sushi was just so-so. Definitely not worth $28 per person for all you can eat. Skimpy servings on the nigiri too. Definitely won't be back here. Oh and all the rolls have cream cheese wtf... I hate that!"}
{"text":"Been here couple times when visiting Vegas. $22 lunch special for all you can eat sushi?! Worth it. Market price on sushi can add up so this all you can eat deal is the best deal you can get so I would suggest not getting ala carte if you're a big eater on sushi. Two rolls will already set you above the all you can eat price so you might as well get the AYCE deal! I've tried several of their signature rolls such as Oh my heart, Pink lady roll, Dynamite roll and Rock & Roll. All good! Be sure you don't order with you eyes because there's a policy that you have to eat everything. Always best when shared with others, don't all order the same thing. Try a little bit of everything. I always make my money's worth it with orders of shrimp tempura. It's a must whenever I come here. You also get a free dessert with your meal as well. I love the creme brulee, soooo delish! I always leave here with a feeling like a I gained 10 pounds."}
{"text":"Delicious! They have a good variety of rolls and I've never struggled to finish one. I'm lucky I live so close!"}
{"text":"Been here once, really enjoyed the place. The sushi was delicious, the sushi chefs were all nice, the ambiance was a great medium-energy. There was moderate level music, primarily hip-hop and secondarily pop. I enjoyed the music and thought it was the right volume. We got our food super fast each time. I believe the price is $27 for all-you-can-eat. I can't comment if that's good or bad, because I don't have a lot to compare it to, but I had a super-fun time here. Place was pretty busy, even on Monday (presidents day) from 730-930."}
{"text":"We went here on my birthday! The food and the service are awesome. I highly recommended this place.  It was an awesome experience especially with my family was with me... Actually I told everyone at work to try it here. I even want to go just by myself...Their appetizers are the best... LOve it to the Maxxxxx!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sizzling steak plate was delicious! gyoza is done really well too. Nice environment, like the decor!"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm on a weird post baby diet-no sugars and low to no carbs. I did not really understand this AYCE culture, in Europe we had carousel sushi and sashimi and we had eat in Tepenyaki/ Sushi restaurants (I think in USA the equivalent would be a high class of that old restaurant Benihana?). So I was DYING for sushi but know I really crave the wasabi (it clears me out and my sinuses are awful living here in the Anus Mundi).   I walked in and my waitress, whose name escapes me and I am so sorry as she was super sweet to me, I hope management can answer with her name, well she and a guy named Stefan were literally really interested in helping me indulge. Of course I could not get the AYCE (and with all that rice I would find it pretty disgusting even not on a diet-and honestly watching some people in America eat actually scares me)-but suffice to say I had hot sake (oddly no sugar and almost no carbs-1.4carbs per serving and NO sugars due to how it is fermented and I love it) so I indulged in both of my desires, luckily Sake does not really affect me for some reason, a glass of wine would make me drunk and red in the face but sake does very little I just love the taste.  I was eating sashimi made by Mexicans and a Filipino--being waited on by a Bulgarian and a girl who had Asian and Mexican in her (the waitress whose name escapes me) and I was all by myself just eating and I swear I gave most Americans a run for their money with the way I ate. It was the best \"splurge\" (food and money) I made in a long time. I really loved this place and any review that says the waitstaff are not attentive, well maybe you are not receptive as when you are open and you let people know what you want, you generally get what you want and the service here was superb."}
{"text":"This is a All you can eat sushi place,  and they do have ala cart as well.  Did not have the All you can eat sushi,  but the Lobster affair was fantastic.  The service was great.  Quality seems to be good, but a bit difficult to tell at this point.  I think it is worth the effort to try."}
{"text":"AYCE sushi.   I enjoy this place. It doesn't have the best sushi in town, so I usually just stick with the specialty rolls and hot dishes, which is a nice change of pace from time to time. If you are trying to satiate a serious nigiri craving, go somewhere else.   The potato croquettes, dynamite, buttery shrimp and scallop, yakitori, surf and turf, seared tuna and salmon skin are some of the regular menu items I order. I'm a fan of the amigo, red dragon and hawaiian rolls.   I wish they had a better happy hour deal, like Kobe and I'd probably visit this place a little more often."}
{"text":"Thank you Vince for being our server... Excellent service and I'm so stuffed; all you can eat sushi...."}
{"text":"Only thing that prevented me from going to the fifth star was we weren't greeted in a timely manner even though a couple of workers came to the front counter. But everything else after that was very good.   We met Kevin, GM, and found he was a very nice gentleman. He apologized for his crew not taking care of us when we showed up.   Kenny was our server and he was very polite and patient with us. Always accommodating and attentive.   The food was very good from the nigiri sushi to the rolls and the ribeye.   The place was roomy and never felt crowded or our conversations drowned out. We were able to have a discussion without having to yell. Felt comfortable there.   Had the AYCE (all you can eat) dinner and their rules are fair and written out plainly. If you are hungry, go for the AYCE as there were a great many choices that are included. Will be back when we are in town again."}
{"text":"This is the closest sushi spot to me and I'm glad it's actually a decent place.  I go here with my little brother and so far it's been great.  The servers there are very friendly and usually have a smile on their face.  Our last server there when we went for ayce was pretty cute as well (always a plus).  As far as the sushi is concerned, I got my money's worth.  The fish was pretty fresh, not the freshest, but still good.  I prefer sushi that isn't drenched in sauce and the rolls that I had were good.  I got away with an extra dessert when you can only order one, thanks to our cute waitress.  The best rolls were the Hawaiian and the Yellowtail Trio.  They also have a great selection of entrees and apps to choose from.  I have had the teriyaki beef and that was really good.  They have something for everyone interested in Asian cuisine.  Whenever I feel like treating myself or my friends and family, this will definitely be the spot."}
{"text":"Cool menu cover and placemats designs. I've sat at the bar in one of the cute booths, and tables service was great every time.   They're sushi was delicious; fresh fish, good sauce variety, spicy rolls and nice cuts of fish. Not sure if they have many riceless options, but it would be a great addition.  If I lived closer I would probably frequent more."}
{"text":"Not super impressed. I ordered the yellowtail jalapeño. Looked like a child sliced the tuna. Miso soup tasted like water. Cucumber salad looked like spaghetti and tasted chalky and weird. They have an all you can eat for 22 at lunch and 27 for dinner. I ordered the 3 things al a carte which totaled more than that (which was expected )but the quality did not match the price."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best sushi restsurants in town. The ACE is the best way to go and you definitely won't be disappointed. All the fish are fresh and for me, perfectly sliced. Sushi at other places are too bug for a mouthfull, but here its perfect. The eel is by far my favorite and the tuna and yellowfin are also top notch. The restaurant is charming and the staff are attentive. Pricing here us pretty standard so no suprises there. You can easily go here on a date or with your family. This place is my number one on my list of sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"They don't put the server name on the check, other wise I would be bragging about how great his service was.  Seated quick and served quicker, although he did not think we got our food fast enough and took care of the first round of drinks.  Great experience, especially after our first stop."}
{"text":"Ploi was a great waitress. She took good care of us. Nice place and great service. I will be coming back soon"}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food. Our waitress Jaime was so nice and she made some great suggestions! Def coming back"}
{"text":"This place has changed a lot since I first went there.  Uni- I know not to expect too much from ayce uni, but the uni came out grey and slimy.  Oysters- the oysters were nice and big. They tasted fresh, and not overpowered with sauce. Probably the best dish.  Surf & turf - bland and flavorless. The shrimp was super rubbery due to being over cooked. AGEDASHI TOFU- fried to a crisp, so when you cut into it.. the entire batter falls off. It should be light and easy to swallow. NIGIRI- fish quality was decent, but filled with a lot of rice. The amaebi tasted ok, but there is a part of the shrimp head that they don't clean off and discard. This makes it very difficult to enjoy, and sharp on the gums.  Asparagus Beef- asparagus wasn't shaved down enough at roots, so you get the bad stringy part stuck in your teeth if it's possible to even bite off.  Beef and asparagus, shrimp skewers - very dry, overcooked, flavorless. ( a waste of stomach space )  Overall, really nothing special anymore. They don't allow half rolls which is unusual at an ayce spot. They seem to have cut the ayce app menu down a bit too. The service was good, and attentive. However, I would rather stick to umiya for ayce. They have a larger selection with much better quality."}
{"text":"Food was great it took a while to come out but it was good, they bring everything out at ones which sucks because we couldn't enjoy the appetizers before the food. Service was slow after the first set of food came out. After they give you the bill they come more often. Great place for kids. Prices are great as well, we did all you eat for kids and an adult. Place is clean. Overall good place :)"}
{"text":"Oyshi is me and my husband's go to AYCE sushi spot because we live so close by. The price isn't bad and I love the décor inside especially. It's usually busy on the weekend but the service is great and I just recently learned that you can order half rolls! Which for me is so much better so I can try different things. I was brave this time and tried the Oh my heart roll and surprisingly I liked it. Me and my husband's go to is the ngiri which is fresh and we love the salmon belly. Overall, I have recommended and even brought different family members and friends to this location and will continue going here since if is convenient and food that I love."}
