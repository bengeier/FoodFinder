{"text":"Visited them a few days ago for lunch. 
We tried their falafel, they were very good. Moist, fresh and flavourful on the inside and crispy on the outside; exactly how a good falafel should be. (7 $)
We also tried their oven baked salmon entree. It was very bland, not seasoned well and a little rare. It came with parisienne potatoes with were bland too(no salt/pepper; just seasoned with garlic and dill) as was the salad which was served with the entree. (22 $)
Wife had a caeser salad for lunch. The vegetables were fresh and crisp. The parmesan was generous and flavourful but the salad lacked the dressing and tasted a little bland as rest of the meal. (10 $)
The tea however was very nice. It was orange pekoe tea bag, served with mint leaves and a cinnamon stick. We'll definitely try this at home. (1.50 $ each)

The restaurant is located in the industrial area, in the middle of nowhere. If it weren't for the groupon we wouldn't have ventured in the area. It was lunch hour and we were the only two customers there, which was very unusual considering this is located in an area where there are companies/offices all around. I think the price of the food might have to do something with it. The food was pretty pricey for everyday office lunch. These kind of prices would have only made sense in the financial district. 

There was a stage there. It seemed that there would be music performance during the weekends/evenings. 

Wish them all the best as they are new and still discovering themselves. Would love to see them succeed and be able to draw crowd to the location. Cheers!"}

{"text":"Dizengoff Opening. 

In recent weeks a new Middle eastern restaurant emerged on the Toronto scene. 

Replacing the original Dr. Laffa location the owners did some serious upgrades to both decor and menu. 

The food here is quite good. A different season for every dish from most of the other places in the area. 

I enjoyed 3 of the classic dishes. Falafel Plate which was crunchy on the outside and came with a nice Dip. The Chicken sandwich was the large portion which was great to share and was very filling. The hummus ful was a meal on its own. 

These 3 plates 2 guys could not put it all down and was a reasonable $30 for a sit down lunch. 

With a full menu and even kids options at $10 I see some great success as word will spread. Congratulations on your opening.
