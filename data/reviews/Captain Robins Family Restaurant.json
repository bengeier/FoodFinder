{"text":"Visited Captain Robin's on quiet afternoon based on the 2 previous reviews and was extremely underwhelmed by both the food and service. 

We began our experience by being place directly in front of the door, causing us to get nearly body checked each time someone passed our table. We sat for roughly 20 minutes before our waitress came to take our drink order, during which time we were able to determine what we would be eating as well. We ordered from the menu and the waitress seemed confused and made us point to the items for confirmation. She seemed very flustered and confirmed our orders several times before she felt confident. 

The drinks then arrived 15 minutes later. My boyfriend got a half cup of coffee and my soft drink came as ordered. Our food then arrived roughly half an hour later despite tables who had arrived after us getting their food far before us. My partner's eggs Benedict were essentially hard boiled and drenched in hollandaise and were accompanied by a mountain of lightly cooked hash. I ordered the fish and chips which, at a seafood restaurant, I assumed would be amazing. The fries were delicious but the halibut left something to be desired. If I had ordered it in a pub I would have enjoyed it but I unfortunately expected more from this establishment. 

If the food or service had made up for the other in some way it could have saved the overall experience. But we did not receive any acknowledgment of the wait or even an apology. We were never checked up on and had to track down our waitress for a refill. This was extremely disappointing and a waste of 2 hours. Yes, the whole experience took that long! Looking around at the other patrons many seemed anxious as if experiencing similar situations. With all the diverse restaurants in Port Credit I would not recommend wasting your time at this place."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in mississauga
 I come here once per week. Great variety of food. Burgers, schnitzel,  soups, etc.
Good portions! Even a nice view beside credit river.
Excellent service."}
{"text":"I took my mom for the first time here today (I'm in the parking lot).. We came in the place was cozy... It took them forever to bring us coffee, and midway through they moved us to the other side of the room.. Our server NEVER asked us once how we were doing or how we liked our food, she never  brought us water, I had to ask the other waitress (she wasn't happy that I asked her)... So now we're watching our waitress talk to everyone else, no one is helping us at all, and I finally get her attention to get me take home bags and bring the bill.. The waitress then says \"ok\" .. 10 minutes later the take home containers arrive but no bill.. Lol... So I ask the other waitress if I can get the bill or pay at the front and she says no cause she's not my waitress..Then we're waiting another 15 minutes I finally find the waitress and ask her for the bill... She looks me right in the face and says \"who's ur server???\" I' respond puzzled \"your
My server lol\" she goes \"oh\" no appology nothing it was very odd... The staff is horrible they don't care about their customers and the food was ok I would give it the standard 7 out of 10.. Waitresses are in horrible moods there and don't help eachother out... The waitress i asked for the bill that said no could have told my server 100 times that we were waiting... I even put
My jacket on and cleaned the table just to be noticed lol.... Craziness.... I never have written a review I even downloaded the app in the parking lot just to share this."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here. It's a busy restaurant for a reason. I ordered the Louisiana salad and he had the club sandwich with ceasar salad. The greens were fresh and crisp, dressing flavourful and hot parts hot! 

Servings are large, delicious and prices affordable. 

I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Poor service today.. Had a beverage 45 min later waitress came to take our order.. Paid the coffee and left."}
{"text":"just had our breakfast here and i was very disaapointed..first mt coffee cup was dirty not washed properly and i had it replaced and still dirty with lipstick stain on it.ugghhh..i asked for my eggs over easy but its still jelly.slice of orange was not fresh and very dry.steak is kinda ok nothing fancy and the \"famous hash browns\" looked like birds nest some cooked some raw.. was very very dissapointed."}
{"text":"Went to this place for a late breakfast, and instead had just the crispy chicken burger. I have to say WOW, best chicken burger ever! Lived up to my expectations of what a burger should be; perfectly crispy and fresh! The portion of fries was huge! Dos not finish it. If you don't eat beef, or simply want a chicken burger, this place knows their stuff! My only suggestion is that they should have chicken or pork gravy, I would love to try the \"hot sandwich\"!!"}
{"text":"Incredible breakfast. I knew this was the place to go - there were 4 tables full of local police eating breakfast here. Unbelievably huge portions and very very reasonable prices. I couldn't finish - the breakfast platter could easily feed 2!"}
{"text":"You get exactly what you pay for when you come here.

This space has had an interesting history .Originally a well-known fish-and-chips joint, it's run the gamut over the last few years, being taken over by a successive string of upstart businesses (remember Goodfellas?). Captain John's is the right kind of greasy spoon restaurant in the right place, and it seems the usual clientele has moved back in.

My co-workers and I ended up coming here after attending a funeral down the street, and the experience was generally what I expected. Beers and wine all around, and a couple big plates of garlic bread and fries.

It's a bit low-class, but it's the right kind of low-class. The garlic bread is served on a big sheet of aluminum foil, the beer mugs look like they've seen better days and half the customers inside looked like they were working off a bender from the night before. The best part, as others have said, is that the portion sizes are big for what you pay. Heaping clumps of fries and enough pieces of bread to comfortably share among four people.

The service is quite good and our server was very attentive and helped us figure out what we wanted. That said, I was kind of confused by the fact that they gave us both breakfast and lunch/dinner menus when we arrived (which was at 2 in the afternoon). If I have some real criticism about this place, they could stand to streamline their menu a bit, because it's way too overwhelming, especially when the server rolls up after a couple minutes and asks if you know what you want to order.

Captain Robin's is a solid option for a quick bite, and the food and service are good. It doesn't set the world on fire, but it doesn't really have to. It's good enough, and that's all it needs to be."}
{"text":"Captain Robins is situated right near the busy hustle and bustle of Port Credit area. Location wise it is perfect. If you know where the Starbucks is, then you'll find this place no problem. It replaced what used to be the three stooges, and prior to that, Helen's Fish and Chips. 

Parking here though is not an easy task. There are limited spots, so be prepared to park across the street and walk across.

The service here is generally lacking. There are a few good servers who I would say actually know what they are doing. The rest at friendly, but of the two times I've been here, they seem like they are completely lost.

This notion carries on to the kitchen staff as well. On a busy Sunday morning, we waited about 45 minutes for our food. We also waited about 45 minutes to be seated. Although we were a large party, we could tell they didn't appropriately seat other guests. There was 1 person at a 5 seat table, and a few other 2/3 people guests seated at a 6 seat table. Also, upon receiving our food, the server forget several items for each order. Upon asking her to retrieve those missing items, it took another 15-20 minutes for something simple like missing toast, or missing potatoes. We had to remind her twice because she simply forgot. 

Overall, the food is good, but nothing to brag about, their service is ok but staff are overwhelmed and because of that are confused. 

This is a great place to go if you have a 2 hour span to waste on breakfast. Organization is definitely needed."}
{"text":"Nice simple menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
The portions are large, well prepared food and inexpensively priced.
The atmosphere was homey and very clean
Finally, the service was absolutely great."}
{"text":"The food is great here & well priced.
The portions are good with one exception.
Everything comes with potatoes... Lots of potatoes.
As a matter of fact way to many potatoes.
Otherwise our meal was fantastic.
The service was fast & friendly. 
A great Sunday morning breakfast stop."}
{"text":"I took my wife and two kids here for breakfast.  It was a Saturday morning at nine and we expected it to be rather busy, and the restaurant was full but also fully staffed.  Coming from a background of hospitality work I am usually very understanding in these situations, knowing how it can get in the kitchen at times.  

We ordered but my son didn't want hashbrowns with his kid's breakfast and instead wanted a pancake.  On the sides menu they were both around the same price so I asked the server if we could substitute.  Not possible, but we could order him the breakfast platter that comes with hashbrowns and pancakes at twice the pricetag..  I tried to explain we didn't want the hashbrowns and it would all be too much food. She insisted she knew what to bring him.  I ordered the breakfast skillet that boasted ham and and onion and mushroom with scrambled eggs on hash with hollandaise.

The food arrived and as I expected there was far too much than I had tried to order in the first place..  Well there was a lot of potatoes..  I mean half of each plate was a pile of soft, flavourless potato.  I guess she got the picture my son didn't want hashbrowns because when his eggs and pancakes arrived they were accompanied by an enormous pile of French fries instead.  can you guess what he ate for breakfast?  The eggs and sausages and pancakes went uneaten..  

My skillet was scrambled eggs on a pile of mushy, unseasoned potato with a few small pieces of ham and two slices of mushroom..  Drowned in lumpy hollandaise that clearly came out of a bag.  The coffee tasted like warm bitter water that no amount of cream or sugar could save.

Entire breakfast took almost 2 hours and most food was left uneaten due to the poor quality.  Server never returned to give us our bill so after about 25 minutes after my wife had taken the kids out to the car I simply got up and tracked down one of the other servers to pay.  I watched several other clients get up and leave before receiving their meals and there were many anxious faces around the room as if everyone was thinking the same thing.  Total waste of $60.

Poor quality, lacklustre service, and cramped eating quarters with too many tables crammed into a small space means we won't be back.  There is a Sunshine Grill right across the street that offers a similar menu with food that actually tastes good at a similar price.  If you're in the area looking for breakfast I suggest you take your business there and avoid this hole."}
{"text":"Jesus. I just had lunch here today and let me tell you I was not expecting the meal I was given at Captain Robins. I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki dinner ($18) because I'm never satisfied with the lunch sized pita anywhere. The meal comes with choice potato, salad and rice and chicken (of course).

I wasn't expecting anything big... but then something big hit the table, my meal! It had to easily be 5 pounds of food on that plate. Souvlaki pieces the size of golf balls, potatoes the size of a softball, a pile of leafy green dressing topped salad and enough rice to feed an Asian family for 2-3 days. Like massive AF.

Years of yelping have taught me that if you say \"Holy shit\" when the food arrives, it's usually best that you not finish your entire plate. So I promptly made the decision to eat half of everything and squirrel the rest away for lunch tomorrow. If you do the math on this, one $18 dinners is actually two $9 lunches, that's cheaper than McDicks yo! #ValuePlus!

If you're having trouble location the Captains quarters it located in behind the Starbucks next to the light house. I hear it's a great spot for breakfast so I'll definitely come back and see if it earns them an extra star or loses them one.

Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"With 5 people in the restaurant you'd think it wouldn't take 40 minutes for chicken fingers, maybe because they burnt the chicken fingers but how does that make sense if they undercooked my onion rings??,and $9 for a take out container of lettuce with some ranch on it, don't waste your money,or your time"}
{"text":"Captain Robins is located behind the Starbucks beside the Port Credit lighthouse. You can't miss it. This review is after my first visit, so I am not a regular nor did I visit when it was called the 3 Stooges. 

So here we go:

Vegetarian Options!

Normally when I go to a restaurant, I am forced to choose either an appetizer or pasta. At Cpt. Robins, the menu had almost too many options! I had a hard time narrowing down what I wanted, so ended up flipping a coin and choosing the veggie burger with sweet potato fries. 

I was not prepared for the giant plate of food that was brought to me! There was so much food, I knew I wouldn't be able to finish it all but it looked so delicious. The veggie burger is actually topped with a full half avocado. Mayo/ketchup etc is served on the side. The sweet potato fries were absolutely delicious with the spicy mayo. I was in vegetarian heaven 

Prices are very reasonable considering how much food you get, it wasn't very busy when we went and the food arrived quickly. 

I quite like this place and we will be returning soon."}
{"text":"I eat a lot but this meal had the portion size feeding the entire family! Portion sizes are very generous. You really get a bang for your buck. I ordered the skillet that came with hash, smoked salmon and hollandaise sauce + fruit on the side. I could barely finish half  of this! Definitely come here when you're feeling extra hungry"}
{"text":"This is our 'go to' breakfast place. Service is superb and the quality and quantity of the food is excellent at all times.
Breakfast specials are very good value and this is a popular place with locals and visitors alike. 
It is close to a Sunset Grill and Starbucks, but is a real eating place rather a latte and wifi establishment!
The breakfast skillet is a real challenge as are the pancakes.
If you have a teenager with an insatiable appetite this is the place to fill them up.
Poutine is very good too."}
{"text":"Food was good (eggs were little too runny for my taste).  Portions were massive.  The kids meals were as big as an adult meal.  The kids pancake special came with 5 large pancakes.  Needless to say we took more than half home with us.  Service was slow given it was not that busy."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, I ordered the Reuben and it came out as a pile of meat on un toasted rye bread with nothing else on it. Waitress thought I had ordered a  Montreal smoked sandwich so I wouldn't suggest ordering that either or anything for that matter. 

I spent $30 for a $10 meal. To sum things up, overpriced menu for bottom of the barrel quality that comes with a friendly smile."}
{"text":"Nestled in the bustling neighbourhood of Port Credit, directly across from the marina is this small, unassuming restaurant. A nautical theme is present throughout this cramped space with a small open kitxhen as the focal point. We visited for breakfast, and there wasn't a spare seat to be found.
Service was impeccable. Fast, efficient, polite and courteous. Food was prepared fast. In very generous portions, making the prices very reasonable for the amount of food recieved. Overall, great spot, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Bit of a greasy spoon place with \"oh my good god!\" size portions of fab food.
Highly recommended that you cone hungry"}
{"text":"The skillet is pretty much my goal here, it's a huge amount of food, that I will likely never finish in one go, but that's why takeout containers were invented. (word of warning if you try to split it thats 4 more, probably not a policy that everyone would like).
Service was friendly, the carafe of coffee means no wondering about refills, and they didn't raise an eyebrow at a friend joining me later. 
It's easiest at off peak times to just go up for your bill, they were doing a lot of take out weekday late lunchish as well. 

Seating is more plentiful than parking here with the starbucks in the same plaza. Over all a decent breakfast place, I'd prefer this to to sunset across the street more just for the options and the shredded hashbrown style."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here the first time yesterday on Saturday morning and it was the busiest I've ever seen it.  I got a breakfast with eggs and sausages  and the plate was huge. We had to take 2 boxes to go. The hash browns were a treat but I'd suggest you ask your waitress to have them cooked well done if you don't like softer hashbrowns. We did have to wait for the food for a long time but they were so packed so I have to understand. The service was really good as well, we were seated immediately and our server came to get our drinks right away even though she was really busy. Our waitress and the hosting girl at the door were both very polite and friendly and it was just a good energy. Waitress had her hair braided back and it was a really courteous and professional touch, no hair around food!! seeing waitresses with long untied hair scares me.

I've also had dinner here a couple times and we usually get 2 meals and share so we can mix and match. I recommend the schnitzel to anyone who's looking to go here for the first time and can't decide from the long menu, because you can't go wrong with it. The fish and chips is also a great big meal for a great price, remember to bring your appetite, you're going to need it! 

One more thing, you're going to be waiting for your food for a while so bring a friend and bring some patience or go on a weekday, it's worth it"}
{"text":"Went to Captan Robins for lunch on a Saturday.  Despite the restaurant being quite busy, they managed to seat us with quick and efficient service.

Our group ordered the ham, cheese and bacon skillet and the Captain's burger and wow they gave us a LOT of food.  The burger was huge and delicious with two very large beef pattys and lots of cheese.  The skillet came on a sizzling hot pan and was well seasoned and tasty.  We left the restaurant extremely satisfied and with food still left over. 

Captain Robins provides great food and service at great value.  I would definitely come again and would recommend this restaurant for breakfast or lunch.

4.5 / 5.0"}
{"text":"Just got my eggs over easy .. egg white mostly while jelly still even the waitress went omg ... got a new one sent over .. reused my toast ..( gave me my one slice back and tossed the other I had taken only 2 bites from .

Not pleased at all.. cheap operation. I'd stay clear.. this place has changed names 4 times ... Humm I'm sensing a reason ! 

Waitress was amazing how ever 

Thank you .. ps how can you screw up breakfast?!?!"}
{"text":"Came here a long time ago when it was called The Stooges and the breakfast was fantastic, huge portions...hadn't checked it out until this past week and had the banquet burger and coleslaw, the burger was well cooked along with the crispy bacon, very good burger but the coleslaw was light on the dressing and should have gone with the fries.

I was told they were related to Mo's in Oakville which if I had to choose I would go to Mo's Captain Robin's is definitely a place to get bang for your buck."}
{"text":"I recently visited this location with my family considering Breakfast for dinner is great anytime. Upon arrival the place was packed however the server was really quick to pushing some tables together in order to accommodate the 6 of us. The menu was quite extensive and aside from breakfast they had the typical diner burgers, poutine, sandwiches and even salmon! We all ordered breakfast with each of us getting something different. French Toast, Pancakes, Toast, Eggs, Hashbrowns and Eggs. We did not expect the portions to be as big as they were!  The french toast wasn't as huge as the pancakes seen in the photo attached. We actually thought that the sides were main dishes itself untill we noticed that that they were just our sides to our main meals! The price was incredible too. All breakfasts dishes ranged between $9.99 - $13.99 and for that value it was definitely a steal!

I once thought Frans was great for breakfast but this hidden Gem is my new go to place for breakfast. 

The service was very friendly and our server was attentive, kind and tried her best to make sure we all were satisfied with our meals. If you are in the Port Credit area and are looking for breakfast, make a Right into Captain Robins and skip out on Sunset Grill across the street."}
{"text":"What I love about them is that they give out generous portions. Its worth the price you pay for. But the cooking is a little odd on some days..and sometimes its good -- so I cant really put my finger on it why it changes every time we go there..which is kind of a let down.

I haven't really found a favorite so far and they have decent fish and chips which is what some people mostly go for. 

Staff is friendly so no complaints.. can be a little slow at times depending on the time and day but thats okay. 

Parking is limited so you might have to park a little further down the road if all the spots are taken. 

Overall, its an okay place to try out."}
{"text":"Worst dinner experience in a very long while. 60+ minute wait - mediocre ribs - disrespectful waitresses that complained about customers complaining about the poor service. Pathetic! We won't be back. Captain Robin - get ready to go down with your ship if that's the service you expect your customers to be satisfied with."}
{"text":"Restaurant wasn't even half full but service was slow. Too, tables are very narrow, especially for the HUGE portions served on HUGE plates. Food was great!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and HUMONGOUS portions of food. Quite delicious too. Only issue was that it takes forever to get in and out. When we were finally seated. It took a while to take our order. Since the service seemed slow and busy, we asked for our bill and takeout boxes right away. But still 45 mins passed before we finally got the boxes and the machine to pay. (Apparently they only have one machine). 
It's nowhere near my favorite breakfast spot...but i'll definitely be back on a day that I have 3 hours to spare."}
{"text":"Not worth the wait!
Went there for dinner on a Friday, service was terrible and had to wait about 45 minutes to get our orders of halibut and chips and a burger.  It was a long wait for our 4 year old son. Also ordered a pop but the waitress forgot to bring it. Portions were big but nothing special in quality. Gave it a try but won't be going back there ever again."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered this from skip the dishes and my goodness do I ever wish we had found this place sooner! We called in advance after noticing they had gluten free toast, but no gluten free French toast option. They allowed us to specify in the notes that the French toast was to be gluten free and we just paid the driver the extra $3.00 (that's where they lose the star - that's a pretty big upcharge for gluten free bread). However -- they gave me three large-ish pieces and they were most likely the best gluten free French toast I've ever had in my life. Seriously. I don't know what bread they used, but it was shaped more like rye bread and so very delicious! 
The breakfast also came with hashbrowns, 2 eggs, and 4 pieces of bacon. 
My husband's breakfast was one of the \"big breakfast options\" and came with hashbrowns, 4 eggs (I think), and toast, bacon, sausage and ham. He was super full, which is hard to achieve with that man. 
I wasn't a fan of the hashbrowns because they are the shredded ones but that's just a matter of preference. All together we paid under $40 and it was delicious. We will definitely be back - maybe in person next time :)
They were super accommodating, even using a food ordering app, which I thought was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant several times and they have amazing fish and chips, reasonable pricing and really good portion sizes. My experience today was not nearly as good as previous visits. I ordered the poutine since the menu said it had real cheese curds. What I got was cubed white cheese with some kind of odd looking fuzz on it, and it tasted like cheese whiz. It left a sour taste in my mouth, both literally and for this restaurant. A shame, because I really enjoyed this restaurant until today."}
{"text":"GIGANTIC PROPORTIONS at such a affordable cost. The restaurants' proportions are very generous and you really do get your meal's worth. Discovered this place years ago and I travel from brampton just to be at this spot."}
{"text":"Returned recently with a group of girlfriends and had an amazing dinner. The fantastic waitress (older lady, blond) had great suggestions in terms of what she liked on the menu. We listened to her and ordered exactly what she suggested. The burger was delicious and the fries were crispy! We were told that all of their food is handmade and it was believable. 

The same waitress was really the highlight of the evening. She was the sweetest thing and truly a gem. We will return to Captain Robins!!!"}
{"text":"Not as good as we thought it was going to be. We love family owned restaurants and decided to try this place, read some good reviews online and was excited, when we got there a younger girl seated is right away with menus but then we were left for over 15 minutes before a server even came to ask us for our drinks or say hello, so we ordered our drinks and food 
, it came out pretty quick, but they forgot my cheddar in my home fries which was fine but i had to bring my plate to the kitchen because our server never came to our table to check on us at all, my boyfriend finished his food before i got mine back and she just dropped off my food and left the massive empty plates on our table and the circle table we were at was not big enough for over 4 plates, we then waited another 10 minutes before we got a chance to ask for take out containers and then another 5 to ask for the bill she handed us the debit machine walked away and didn't come back so we ripped off our receipt and just left. 

We were really hoping to find a new restaurant as we go out every Sunday but this wont be it unfortunately. 

I work as a waitress so i know how customers should be treated and we didn't get good service here at all. 

The blonde polish lady i believe served us, i hope today was just an off day and if we come back i hope its better next time."}
{"text":"After a busy day, we decided to give the new Captain Robins Restaurant a try. The friendly atmosphere ushers us right in the door! A smiling server directs us to a table. We sure didn't have to wait very long! (To be fair, it was 430 pm) Piping hot food arrived, the Reuban sandwich was huge, tasty and disappeared quickly after it was served to my husband. He shared an onion ring, and as far as good onion rings go, these were amazing! Next, my choice was the 'heaped high' country (breakfast)  skillet. This was a real treat, reminding me of a favourite 'skillet' at a friends restaurant back in Saskatchewan! 
We will become regulars after having had their great comfort food today! Great food at a reasonable price = happy customers!

Our neighbourhood needed a relaxed restaurant, and we finally got it!!"}
