{"text":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I will never, ever go back here again. When they first opened their food was good but this place has gone severely downhill! They actually water down their sweet n sour sauce!!!! I have never in my life had watered down sweet n sour until we ate here tonight. The consistency was literally like red water....no joke! It was purely disgusting. We ordered crab puffs (with barely any cream cheese in them) and egg rolls and we couldn't even finish our appetizers because dipping them in the red water was just unappetizing! My husband ordered shrimp chow mein and there were 3 shrimp in the whole dish. My biggest pet peeve is when restaurants cut back on stupid things....like watering down their sauces. I have never encountered a restaurant that did that so greatly then this place. What a disgrace! If you want good quality food go to Great Wall! I wish I had, but this place was more convenient, next time I'll drive further so I don't feel that I just threw my money away!"}
{"text":"Garbage, do not waste your money.  The bo bo platter had gummy beef skewers, fried chicken skewers wsy over cooked,  and mushy flattened shrimp that looked like they were beaten like an inmate.  The chicken chop suey had chewy chicken, a few veggies, too much sprouts, and canned mushrooms. This slop sucks."}
{"text":"if a lower rating was possible I would give it! Used to go here so thought we would try it again, what a mistake. This tasted so bad we threw it away, yes we spent over $31 and tossed it. Everything tasted the same, like diesel fuel, the taste would not come out of our mouth. Eat here with caution, if you dare, we wont\"t be back."}
{"text":"We love this place! We just moved to AZ from CA and the chinese here is fresh and amazing! The prices are great too!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on service. Don't order online. We waited 50 minutes before calling to ask for a status only to find out they were just putting in the order and it would be another 45 minutes. 

I cancelled the order."}
{"text":"I've been to 3 other chinese restaurants in the area and I've revised them down to 2 stars because this place was better.  I usually give 2-3 tries on Chinese so hopefully my next trip or two will be consistent with the first experience.

a little heavy on the sesame chicken sauce.  it doesn't need to be swimming in it.  lo mein was good.  kid friendly place."}
{"text":"Really nice lunch place with extremely fair prices. The food came quick and the service there was very cordial and friendly. As far as Chinese restaurants go, this is a great place to grab a plate and eat quickly. The food was decent- not the best thing I have ever tasted- but for a Chinese restaurant in the middle of a desert, it was pretty good. Overall it was an enjoyable experience with enjoyable food. I would go there again!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and it won't be my last! Great service and tasty food! Make sure to try the House Special Beef, that thing is amazing! Very clean atmosphere and I can't compliment the service enough. The owner even came out and made sure everything was great!"}
{"text":"I ordered here for the first time because it was the only Chinese in my area that delivers. I was impressed how fast the food came, still very hot and fresh. Everything was good but my favorite was lo mein and kung pao chicken. Portions were good. It is the best Chinese I have had so far. I recommend this place anyone looking to tryout good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Great place!  And they deliver!  Ordered orange chicken and there actually was chicken instead of just breading like at Panda Express.  My spring rolls were cold but the did not hesitate to deliver us new hot ones when I called about them being cold.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"So far everything we have tried has been really good. Our family likes that they delivery perfect for after that long day and you don't want to cook or even leave the house. They are very accommodating on orders where the kids don't want the brocoli on the cashew chicken for instance.  If you order before 3pm the lunch menu saves a few $$ . We also found out there open on holidays however the holidays the do charge a higher price."}
{"text":"I had Bo Bo Platter, Orange Beef, House Special Pan Fried Noodle & Happy Family delivered.  I got the order about 35 minutes after ordering online.  The bo bo platter had egg roll, crab puff, fried shrimp, beef on skewer, chicken on skewer and fried wonton.  All were good all except the egg roll, which was greasy.  The orange beef was crispy and good, but didn't have much orange flavor.  It would have been better if it had some orange peel in it.  The house special pan fried noodles tasted good but didn't have much shrimp, chicken, beef or pork in it.  The best dish I had was the happy Family.  The sauce was delicious and there was lots of chicken, beef, shrimp, scallops and pork.  If the egg roll was not as greasy and the pan fried noodles had more meat I probably would have given a 4 star.  I will definitely be order from them again."}
{"text":"You must try the Wang tong soup, might me the best ive ever had.  Steady flow of customers , really great service an affordable pricing."}
{"text":"This is a very delicious Chinese food in this area that I could find around here and I loved some of their dishes! I was here with my family a couple times were enjoying our foods very much in our ordered for dinner when we were there! This is a true Chinese foods and the only Chinese place in this area for you and your family come to enjoy foods!
I truly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good place... Each of had the lunch special which included soup, egg roll, wonton and entree with rice for $5.50 each.  Great spot to get lunch (speicials from 11 - 3 - Mon - Sat) or dinner at a very reasonable price and by the way....the food was good."}
{"text":"This place serves up a few authentic dishes - I have ordered the salty fish and Chicken fried rice, House pan fried noodles are few times and every time they are very good."}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR FOOD!!! I just ordered from here and halfway through my lemon chicken unnoticed a weird texture. Looked at another piece of chicken and sure enough it is RAW!!!! So disgusting. Other dish we ordered was fine and but now I'm skeptical to order from here again."}
{"text":"I was a loyal customer and would order from this place only.  About 3 months ago the quality has gone down.  First it was the fried rice now it's other food.  Today will be my last time ordering from them.  The service is good but the food went from great to so-so.  I wish it could be the way it used to be."}
{"text":"My husband and I took food to go yesterday.  Being from NY it's been hard finding good Chinese food!  One place, not far from my house is good, but we were there so we got it.  Honestly, I was a little sad that they didn't serve boneless bbq spareribs, but instead we got the bbq pork!  It wasn't the same, but it was very good!  We also got the Chicken and broccoli; sometimes I think twice before ordering chicken because it could be chewy!  Theirs happened to be really good!  For its location, in Gilbert, the prices were fair!  The lady was nice, and a guy even brought it out to us when it as ready, in a box, that made it cleaner and easier to get home.  I thought he was nice too!  I would get food there again!  It was very tasty!!"}
{"text":"One of one of the better Chinese restaurants around They have very large portions and the deliveries are super fast, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised by their extensive lunch menu for around $5!  For $5.25 I got the chicken and broccoli, which came with soup, rice, spring roll and crab wonton.  

Everything was tasty and with a soda and tax/tip I walked out spending a total of $10.  You can barely do that at McDonald's these days, and Mandarin Chef is much better than McD's any day of the week if you ask me.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"The best chinese restaurant in AZ. The egg dropped soup remind me of my mom's soup when I was a child and sick. Waitress was attentive and friendly. A guy came in an ordered a complicated meal and the staff was very friendly and accommodating! I am coming back. You guys set up the bar high."}
{"text":"I just love Mandarin Chef. One thing that puts it above the rest is the fact that they will deliver to my house.  The food is good and the prices are definitely right.  They even have a nice website portal so that you can order directly from their website.  It is user friendly and the delivery is very prompt.

We usually order quite a few dishes and they are always very good.  I am a really picky Fried Rice eater and like mine a certain way;  lots of veggies, egg and cooked darker brown.  So many places don't do it the way I like it and the way that I grew up used to it.  Mandarin chef is one of the closest I have found.  Today, I ordered a lunch special of Honey Chicken (usually an entree we order for dinner) and it came with fried rice (not the usual with stuff in it), a crab puff, a vegetable egg roll, and soup.  The price is right for $5.99.  You just can't get all that somewhere else.

The food is always tasty and I will always go back to Mandarin Chef."}
{"text":"Way Good! I usually go to Cogburns next door and thought it was worth giving this place a shot. It was very good! Food tasted fresh and didn't have the same poor after taste like Panda or several other Chinese restaurants have occasionally. I could tell it was fresh not to mention a very good price. I'm very happy with my experience and will be back in the future."}
{"text":"5 stars, because they deliver! And the delivery guy, Brian, was super friendly and awesome.
The food arrived hot and in a timely manner.
The hot and sour soup was great with just the right amount of spice and was probably my favorite thing we ordered.
Mongolian beef was good, but I'm a harsh critic on this dish, because the chinese restaurant in our old neighborhood had the best one I've ever had.
I haven't dined in yet, so I can't give a rating on that, but I will try it out one of these days. In the meantime, I absolutely will be ordering delivery again in the near future.

Sidenote- if you are debating between this restaurant and Great Wall chinese restaurant in the same area, go here. It is a thousand times better than Great Wall. Seriously, it beats it by a landslide. You can check my review on that one to see what I mean."}
{"text":"I love this small Chinese restaurant. It is quick. The food is good. I can always find a table. They also deliver in the local area. 

I have eaten here three or four times in the past. Each time the food was very good and the potions are generous. Except with the lunch specials, there is always enough for another meal, or two. 

Today, I had the spicy garlic beef lunch special (comes with soup of your choice, egg roll, crab puff and fried rice). The beef was delicious, with just the right amount of garlic and heat, in crisp vegetables and tasty brown sauce. 

Lunch is quick. I am writing this 25 minutes after arriving, having finished my meal. Stop in and give them a try!"}
{"text":"Oh my heavens was this food great! Really big portion sizes. Ordered 5 different things, it was all perfect!! I had it delivered, delivery took an hour 10 minutes. Next time I'll just order earlier. I 100% recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Of all the Chinese places in the area, this is the best. Tastes fresher, is less greasy."}
{"text":"Yum!! Love this place. I've ordered something different every time and they never disappoint. Quick, hot delivery too! So glad we found this place"}
{"text":"Recently moved to Gilbert and have been trying different Chinese restaurants. We ordered shrimp fried rice, beef n broccoli and egg rolls. I would not recommend any of these items. 
As simple as is it to make these meals, I can't imagine the other food being any better, but can't say for certain."}
{"text":"We ordered the Chicken Lo Mein and Teriyaki Chicken.  The chicken was really good and not overcooked like I encounter at many places.  The prices are a bit high but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place is not good !!!!!!!! not sure what the reviewers raving about this place are talking about ; we have had it 3 times in past year living nearby , today , order 2 meals , 22.50$ , which is about average , comes with 1 rice for 2 meals so I ask they say well they come with smalls so we put in a large ok , I guess if that's what u wanna do for 2 adult meals , but FLAVORLESS , general gsos is soggy and gross , first time we have tried this , wife got shrimp Kung paid , no seasoning no flavor , ton of peanuts , we wanted to like this place but won't be back , F"}
{"text":"The cashier was friendly.  They were very accommodating for special requests.  They had potential. But my spicy chicken was mostly vegetables w some rubber tasting chicken.  My mother got beef dish which was tasty but the same - too much vegetables and beef cut large.   Not sure I'll be back-too much competition in the area."}
{"text":"Super yummy food. Fast delivery with hot food. Just like you were dining in instead of delivery."}
{"text":"This place is just about as good as it gets. Not only are they very nice, but the food we order is always wonderful quality. Admittedly there is a large part of the menu we haven't tried, since we stick to our own favorites, but everything we have tried is great. Plus, we feel the price is extremely reasonable for the amount of food you get. The value is especially great for their dinner and lunch combos. I love that the dinner combo comes with a crab rangoon, egg roll and a single large fried shrimp. Plus soup! All for around $10. I know of nowhere else you can get that sort of value."}
{"text":"I've tried every Chinese take out place in a 5 mile radius (at least) since I moved to the area 2 years ago. Mandarin Chef has since been my go to for a quick meal. I'm sensitive to a lot of preservatives found in \"Chinese\" take out,  so that rules out many options I've tried in the area. On top of that,  I'm somewhat picky when it comes to flavor and texture. Mandarin Chef serves up tasty orange chicken and walnut shrimp. Crab rangoons and fried rice are decent, and Singapore noodles are delish. The lo mein is a tad greasy for my liking, but my little one likes it. Service is always friendly, food prepared quickly,  and even delivery is never more than 30 mins. Some items are hit or miss here, but I do have favorites I enjoy. Food is 3.5-4 stars for me and service is a 5."}
{"text":"Sooo good! Was having Chinese food cravings and didn't feel like driving, so I looked up nearby Chinese delivery. Was pleasantly surprised--I ordered the chicken lettuce wrap and cashew nuts chicken, both which were delicious! Also, the delivery guy was very friendly and cordial. Will order from them soon!"}
{"text":"Struggling with this place. Service is FAST for delivery and we are so happy to finally have someone to deliver but I think the quality suffers on some things because of it. First time General Taos was soggy & soft as if it wasn't done but comparing it to what we are use to, fried not baked. Kung Pow has a lot of peanuts. Veggies could be a bit more done in all dishes. Soup is good but lukewarm at best. Thinking it is either not hot enough when it is put in the cup or it cools since they deliver in an open box. I do Love the Spicy Garlic Chicken, have had that twice now. Also love the homemade hot mustard, that will clear your sinuses just the way I like it. Egg rolls, shrimp are also cooked to perfection. Lo Main for a side, don't mind paying for that over rice. Going to still order for now."}
{"text":"After a second visit I am revising down to 2.25 stars.  They do chicken dishes pretty well but we have been disappointed in other things.  And their spicy is not very spicy.  I added hot oil to my spicy garlic shrimp.  I actually dipped my shrimp into the side of hot oil I requested.  That got 'er done.

I almost requested chopsticks so that I could repeatedly jam them in my ears and stop hearing the brutal Muzak renditions of such songs as \"Yesterday\" and \"I Started a Joke\".  My daughter even piped up with, \"Dad, this music is really, really bad.  What is it?\""}
{"text":"Our family loves Mandarin Chef and after having a disappointing visit at the nearby Sun's Buffet, I'm frankly a bigger fan. My husband always orders the Garlic Spicy Chicken, extra spicy and I really love their Mongolian Beef. The people working here are kind and always remember a regular customer."}
{"text":"Got lunch here, and will probably get it again but not somewhere I'd go by choice.

Pros: Second best Mongolian Beef I've had out here, tasted perfect. The veggies also tasted fresh and not frozen or anything along those lines. Egg Roll and Crab Puff were tasty as well, two items I hardly consume at other Asian joints. Food was also done at the time I ordered at, which was great to pick-up when you have a :30 minute lunch break.

Cons: Asked for extra spicy, wasn't even spicy. Tiny portions."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and delicious. Good flavor not blend. Service is good and fast. Highly recommend especially for pick up."}
{"text":"Ordered take out the other day. My fiancé liked his sesame chicken. I wish they would have packaged the sauce in its own container because by the time it was delivered the chicken was soggy. 

I had vegetable egg foo young. Pretty good!  I also had the crab puffs. They were good too. Did not care for the sweet and sour dipping sauce. Too tomato-y for me. 

Service was good. The delivery guy was nice. It's pretty good and it's close to the house. I'd like to try some other things."}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from here countless times. The food is delicious! I tried the Mongolian chicken for the first time and loved it. Perfectly spicy and the veggies were fresh. Crab rangoons are always good, so doesn't love fried creme cheese?! The order always arrives a couple minutes soon than they say which is great and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Good solid Chinese food that actually delivers. I wish their Sweet and sour sauce was thicker but there are so many other good things about this place..I'm glad its close"}
