{"text":"Amazing sashimi! The rock shrimp and spicy chicken are amazing as well. Everything is great here and they have a lot of different choices."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Great food!  Nice service!  Pretty decor!  Fantastic Prices!  Lovely presentation!  Clean!  Great serving size.  Delicious!  My new favourite sushi spot in the neighbourhood!  Free neighbourhood street parking!"}
{"text":"Just don't get any don't get any chicken dish and you mayo joy your meal. it's  great for the lunch special...or it was until I got food poisoning from the chicken skewers which were half-raw (not sushi) and was throwing up within 10 minutes. They told me the chicken was well-done and that I was imagining it! I was in the washroom for hours and I'm still totally grossed out....never again"}
{"text":"Never a bad moment at Sakura Garden. I've gone 5-6 times for all you can eat. Good quality sushi. Small enough of a restaurant that the wait staff are prompt. Sitting at the back near the kitchen gets you quicker service. One of my favourite sushi spots. Good place to go on a date too."}
{"text":"Our new go-to place for take out. Friendly staff, generous portions, reasonable prices, and delicious food. If you order one of the signature entrees, get the hot and sour soup (delicious).

In typical Asian restaurant fashion, the menu isn't really focused and spans from Chinese to Vietnamese to Japanese. However for a restaurant that tries to put out a wide range of food, everything I've tried so far has tasted better than most in this price range.

Check this place out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to Sakura Garden twice for AYCE, and I've been happy with both times I've gone. The price for AYCE (Even on weekends at lunch for $14) is unbeatable. The sushi and sashimi are fresh, and tasty - much better than the ones I've tried in Mississauga or Oakville. Menu has your standard kitchen items, and there are plenty of rolls to choose from. Service is attentive, although slower when busy (I believe they have 3 waitresses and 2 line cooks). 

Place is quite small, but cosy. Price is the biggest factor though since at $14 for lunch or $23 for dinner (I think), it's very competitive."}
{"text":"Food was really good, and there's a variety of things to choose from, aside from Japanese dishes, they also have Chinese and a few Thai items on the menu. My favorite dish was the Hawaii roll, which had salmon, avocado and cream cheese. The only thing I didn't like was the service, I felt a little rushed at the end, it was around 10:00 pm and our waitress came over and asked if we wanted anything else since the kitchen was closing, which is fine. I then asked her what time the place closes and she said 10:00pm, but it closes at 10:30pm. That was fine too, but I felt very uncomfortable finishing up my meal while the whole staff was sitting near our table watching us and waiting for us to finish."}
{"text":"Went there last night for our anniversary dinner. I didn't realize it was a buffet but being to other similar buffet restaurant I thought it would be a lot of fun. The service was fast, and portions abundant, but lack a distinctive flavour. As I like to sample, I would say that the size of dishes was too big, on top of the fact the restaurant policy is to make you pay for leftover. So, generally, a positive experience without glamor."}
{"text":"Terrible service over the phone. Tried to place an order for delivery and spent close to 10 minutes on the phone placing the order before they told me that I am too far for delivery. And I live 4km from the restaurant. Such a waste of time. Jatujak is also 4km and they gladly accepted my delivery order. And the food there is amazing!"}
{"text":"Terrible quality. Should use better ingredients. Rice undercooked. Thought it is difficult to screw up Sushi.."}
{"text":"Everything you could ask for at an AYCE restaurant - quality, presentation, service all good. On a cold snowy evening the place was still buzzing."}
{"text":"I had to try out this AYCE sushi place due to the raving Yelp reviews, but I must admit I was pretty underwhelmed. 

Tuna sashimi and hamachi is $1.50 extra per piece. With $23 per person, I expect it to be included like Sushi Fun. The sashimi was fresh - there wasn't any hint of pre packaged frozen-ish taste. The salmon rose here has no rice in it, which is also new to me. We had to ask for our dishes multiple times (understandable since this is AYCE) but it was only the third time when our waitress told us they were out of soft shell crab.. 

The service is prompt but cold. The servers were not friendly and walks away from the table before you finish your sentence. They do a good job of keeping your water glasses filled, but that's pretty much it. 

This is also the first time seeing a Japanese AYCE place serving dim sum. The shrimp dumpling (har gow) skin was over cooked and fell right off the shrimp. The spinach dumpling was decent but the skin was very chewy.

Nothing special about the rolls offered here. It stands out from other places only because the size if the rolls is quite large. The Hawaii Roll had cream cheese in it combined with cooked Salmon - A-OK.

Not likely to return, they need to improve on their customer service skills."}
{"text":"I work close by and used to order take-out for lunch here quite frequently; they have a lunch combo that's 2 rolls plus miso and salad, if you pay cash it's $9, not bad.  Except I've noticed the quality has really gone down in the past year or so.  I don't expect top grade sushi for that price, but you can tell there's just not much effort being put into the food at all, like the sushi chef isn't really trained.  As in, the salmon roll is poorly made- the salmon pieces are cut way too big and chunky, and the roll itself tends to fall apart.  And the miso soup is very watered down. The interior of the restaurant is nice, but I since I only get take-out that doesn't compensate at all for the poor quality food.  Also, they need to take down their \"Grand Opening\" sign already, which has been up for the past two years, if not longer.  It just says something about the how little they care about presentation and quality."}
{"text":"Not impressed! Food quality was mediocre, chefs obviously didn't take pride in the preparation or presentation, and fish freshness was sub par at best. I'm shocked at the high reviews! 

Also the service was lacking. Not friendly or polite, and never attentive. The vibe was that noone wanted to be there. 

Highlight was the Dynamite roll and everything else we had to force down. Came for all you can eat lunch. I'm sure we had a lower than average experience and that they could do better, but would not take the risk of coming back at my own expense!"}
{"text":"Reliable spot for sushi and Asian staples.  I'm happy they are in the neighbourhood and hope they continue to do well. Hard to rank this up there in terms of quality with all the Asian competition in the city but this place is great for what it is - good prices, family friendly, good value, and speed. Solid for what it is."}
{"text":"Decided to give it a try for sushi takeout since there aren't many other big restaurants in the area and we're concerned smaller places might not have enough turn over and have stale food.  The takeout maki has been good and we've had takeout twice.  They even put it on a nice sushi tray unlike our other go to place at Yonge and Finch that charges extra for a platter.  Good filling to rice ratio.  We are pleased."}
{"text":"The service is horrible. Took a half hour to get our sashimi and sushi. Never got it.
Turns out they lost our order. It is not a big place.  Really????? Walked out!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to go because of the high ratings, but it's a disappointment. Service was fast, but waiters weren't attentive, I had to correct them a couple of times until they got the right order. The food was okay, I wouldn't go again or recommend it to anyone. If you're looking for a good sushi this is NOT the place to go."}
{"text":"It's a roller-coaster experience at Sakura.

Sometimes it's amazing, while other times it's passable. But on most days it's on the better end of the scale, that's why I keep coming back.

I recommend their $13 weekday ($14 Fridays) lunch buffet that include sashimi, which is rare. Also I quite enjoy their savory General Tso combo that includes a delicious bowl of hot & sour soup for $7 during lunch hours. Unfortunately they \"used to\" have an amazing beef short rib combo (grilled to near perfection), but the last few times I ordered, it has been disappointing."}
{"text":"Great all you can eat sushi for an affordable price! Everything is fresh, great pan-Asian variety of food choices and quick service. Seating is limited so I recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"23 bucks for all you can eat including dim sum.  Man can't beat that."}
{"text":"Not bad, especially for the price, but I wouldn't consider this my AYCE sushi buffet of choice. I was looking for a sushi buffet place close to Yorkdale within a reasonable budget. I was actually lucky to find this place which offers AYCE lunch for $14. Anything under $16 for sushi buffet nowadays is a steal! My boyfriend and I got here around 11:15am, which is considered very early for sushi buffet. There's street parking right in front, but if you drive down a block or two, you can park on the side streets for free. Do not park on the street in front if you're not going to pay or if you don't add to your metre time because there were 2 parking enforcement officers writing tickets within the hour and a half I was eating (we could see them from the window).

You can easily spot this place because of the grand opening sign, even though I think this restaurant has been open for years. Since we were the only ones eating, it was very quiet - no music or tv in the background. The menu is generous for a $14 lunch buffet. They even offer sashimi, but it's max 3 pieces per person and you can only order 1 of each sashimi. I really enjoyed their sweet and sour chicken! It's not 99% fried dough like other sushi places and tastes just like what you would pay $10 for at a different Chinese restaurant. All the chicken dishes I got (sweet & sour, yakitori, teriyaki, chicken fried udon) were made with white meat, although sometimes it was quite dry. Dessert consisted of 5 different flavours of ice cream and the cutest flower bowl.

Service is decent. English is definitely not their first language here, but that wasn't a problem at all. Our waitress was very soft spoken and fairly silent, but I wouldn't consider her impolite or inattentive. We did have to ask for soy sauce and ginger/wasabi since they didn't bring it with the sushi, but that's okay. Food came quickly and they cleared our plates as soon as we were done eating. Leftover food is charged at $.50 per dish which isn't bad."}
{"text":"All you can eat for $23?  Holy cow yes I'm a fan!  Six rolls to an order, reasonable portions, dessert included. Parking on the street, price per age for your kids."}
{"text":"Tried it out tonight.  Very good.   Recommend the all you can eat.  Service is fast and price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Came Friday night for AYCE sushi dinner and it wasn't too busy. We were seated pretty quickly and theres a huge variety on the menu. If you love avocado, you MUST come here! If you order any sushi with avocado,  they really load it up. Also, the size of the rolls are pretty big! Don't order too much because you'll probably get full much faster with the sizes here. 

Typical price for AYCE sushi dinner (~$25). Service here is super fast. We ordered alot of rolls and got all of them within 10 minutes. They were so fast they had to stack some of the plates on top of each other!  I'll definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a quick Japanese lunch. They have a huge selection of all you can eat Japanese food and excellent bento boxes. The quality of the food is amazing for the price which is extremely affordable. The service is also excellent and they will accommodate for all dietary restrictions by subbing veggie for shrimp tempura or a cucumber for a California roll in the bento boxes and meals. I recommend this as a really good option for great food at great prices."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi I've ever had but certainly not the worst.

Sticking to vegetarian options, I got fresh toppings and near perfect rice. It didn't have me crawling back for more but I certainly left satisfied.

Servers were friendly and attentive. I suspect they could have known their menu a little bit better but they took it in stride. I can't complain about the service as some of the other reviews have.

I wish they'd take down their 'grand opening' sign though. I swear they've been open for a couple of years. Maybe they need to change it to a 'still open' sign as on that strip of Avenue Rd, that's an accomplishment!

I have to admit that their proximity to Baskin Robins is a huge bonus for me. What better on a Friday night than sushi and once cream?

I would have no reason not to return. In fact, I think there are a few more menu items I'd like to try."}
{"text":"Our favourite go-to Asian fusion restaurant in Toronto...great delivery too!"}
{"text":"Ate here on Feb. 10, 2016 and it's my second and last visit.  Food was mediocre...the sushi tasted bland compared to other AYCE restaurants although the portions were plentiful.  Miso soup was watered down.  Service was pretty much non existent other than taking your order and cleaning up after you're done.  For the price I paid for a 4:30pm ayce meal ($22plus taxes), I feel that at least a smile on your way in and out would at least be given...the store was empty, you'd think they'd be happy to see a customer.

Lastly, take this with a grain of salt, but I got sick after eating here with gastroenteritis.  Whether it was because of the employee in the food prep area coughing profusely on two occasions, contaminated food or somewhere else entirely outside of this restaurant...I'll never know, but I had no contact with a sick person after this restaurant and until I got sick.

Never again."}
{"text":"The service isn't great but the food is solid. Not the best sushi in town, but definitely the best all-you-can-eat for a few miles around. Usually very fresh, occasionally mediocre (though I think their DineSafe warning smartened them up in a hurry). If you don't want to drive ten minutes and shell out for the excellent à-la-carte options to the southeast on Yonge, this is a great local option."}
{"text":"For the price and the option of delivery this has been my go to place. I just wished there was a little more consistency on the fish assortment in my chirashi."}
{"text":"Service is consistently friendly; sushi is always fresh & tasty; ambiance is inviting; clean washrooms; exceptional value - especially the reasonably-priced & generously varied all-you-can-eat menus.  I won't eat raw fish, and where other sushi places want to charge me extra or aren't willing to allow any changes to a menu item, I appreciate that Sakura Garden is always happy to accommodate me by cooking/grilling the salmon in my salmon/avocado maki.  I live in Michigan & always look forward to visiting Toronto where Sakura Garden is always a highlight of my stay.  Great place for a date, business lunch, birthday dinner, etc.  You won't be disappointed!  
-Michael in Michigan, 
loyal SG customer since 2013!"}
{"text":"Always tasty. Always fresh. Their noodles are so yummy and the portions are quite large. I would do the all you can eat rather than a la carte. I'm always coming back. It's great. And not Exspensive!!!"}
{"text":"Really great for AYCE or al la carte.

Very consistently above average, check out the rock shrimp and spicy salmon sushi.

I am a weekly regular. I have tried many other places in the area and this one is the best.

I would highly recommend trying out Sakura Garden!"}
{"text":"We did the AYCE sushi, which was $30 for when we went. This is definitely on the more pricier side for AYCE, and I think that there definitely is better quality of sushi out there. The fish itself was okay, but like any other AYCE place, they try to fill you up on the rice. I think they tried a little too hard here, because there was simply way too much rice, and my table ended up wasting a lot of the rice because nobody wanted to eat it. 

I did see some of the orders the chef made for delivery or take out, and they did look kind of better, but still, there are better sushi places out there!

Overall, I would not return and would not recommend."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was surprised by how much I loved Sakura Garden! I've been twice now for AYCE, and it hasn't disappointed! 

There is a great menu including kitchen items (general tao, pad thai, tempura, agadashi tofu, teriyaki, basically anything you can imagine) and then lots from the sushi bar, including rolls, sushi and sashimi - all for about $22! 

The sushi is really good - always fresh, and there are interesting rolls to boot! There is also great service - attentive without being overbearing, always there to top up drinks or take your next round order! 

I definitely can't recommend Sakura Garden enough - I don't even know if I can think of a comparable AYCE downtown - so if you can get there, go!"}
{"text":"Great AYCE sushi place uptown. Went with a group of 8 plus a baby and they didn't charge for the baby even though she made the most mess. Lots of variety, nice items for the amateur and connoisseur sushi eater. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Place is a little small but that just keeps the food coming faster. Easy to order too much so be careful."}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better than this for AYCE sushi!  The service was friendly and attentive, the Tom Yum soup was divine and the sashimi was super fresh.  What more can you ask for?  

At $23 per person on a Friday-Saturday night, this restaurant is competitively priced (although drinks are not included).  I also loved the rock shrimp (I would ask for it to be a light on the sauce next time) and the General Tsao chicken.  The mango ice cream and fried bananas put me over the top but I would do it all over again next time.  It was worth the extra time at the gym the next day!"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times as it is walking distance from my office, and one of our go-to places for a group lunch.

Never really that full, we always can get a table for four or six of us without much of a wait. 

Inside is generally clean with nice decor (last time it smelled like wet mop though - yuk!) and service is decent enough. They are not exactly friendly, but are not rude, and are relatively attentive, though at times we have had to wait quite a while to get the bill - not great when you have to get back to work. 

Two stars because over the last few visits the food has consistently been pretty blah. Hot food came out cold, sashimi came out frozen, and a few items from our AYCE order never arrived. 

Biggest complaint is that a few of us kept getting stomach sick after eating here - not a good sign. After the last visit when all of us got ill, we made the decision to never return. 

Yes the lunch AYCE is cheap, but not worth it when the food sucks and makes you sick."}
{"text":"I've recently ordered takeout twice and had a lunch dining experience. Friendly staff, fast service, great quality food. For takeout I had the spicy salmon maki, shrimp tempura maki, and spicy tuna maki. The rice was warm and the sushi roll was fresh, definitely made for enjoyable sushi. Miso soup is flavourful. The price I paid was reasonable and worth the food I ordered. I have not tried all you can eat but I will one day. I recommend this place to all sushi and Chinese food lovers."}
