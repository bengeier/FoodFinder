{"text":"This place has limited seating and still cannot handle the capacity of people. We waited over an hour for our food just so we can be served cold soup and sandwiches. Coffee was lukewarm.  Despite the effort from the servers, it was not an ideal experience."}
{"text":"A friend and I walked around the neighbourhood looking for a place to eat and we stumbled upon because it looked lively and had great atmosphere.  Great patios, indoor seating, decor was great, good music. But that's ALL this place offered. The drinks were mediocre, which came half way through our meal. Corn on the Cob was not cooked all the way through The guac was tasteless, not condiments just onion The ceviche was overly \"fishy\" tasting The tacos were cold, great tasting, but warm shells would have been great.  The service was extremely poor and needs some serious improvement. Over all, visually GREAT, but that is where it ends. Terrible food, drinks and terrible service. Extremely disappointing, because I love Mexican."}
{"text":"We went there for my wife's birthday celebration.  Service was very good, very pleasant , quick and enthusiastic.  Tried the nachos and ceviche appetizers. Pretty good. Tried the pulled pork tacos, a little dry for my liking. Chicken adobo was decent. Prices are reasonable . Personally I've never been a big fan of Mexican food.  What ruined the night was in the next table next to us was a really loud and profanity laden group. The waiter or manager didn't seem to care that there were families within ear shot. They seemed to be more concerned they got refills on their alcohol. I think they should have moved them into the other patio.  Decent place , not sure if I'd return."}
{"text":"Great service, awesome outdoor seating with fire place! The tacos were really good and the servers were very friendly and attentive.  Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for a late brunch on a Saturday afternoon, with a reservation, only to find the table wasn't ready.  HOWEVER, the service was great - better than I expected. They were super attentive.  Tequila cocktails on point, tacos were delicious - the Pollo Frito was the best I've had in Toronto (even better than LC) - and the tortilla chips were perfectly salted, and homemade!  I would come back to try their dinner/lunch special.   The only cons I would say is that their brunch menu is very limited (only 3 types of tacos), and I got 3 bug bites by 3 different bugs while dining (inside)."}
{"text":"Went for the Dia de Muertos festival and did not have a very good time. Tickets stated a 5 pm start yet things happened at 10 pm. False advertising. The only menu option: Duck or Snapper Fish. A big disappointment."}
{"text":"This is my first restaurant review due to the incredible poor dining experience I had here that needed to be shared.  The service was incredibly poor and the menu was not as advertised on the website or outside menu posted on door.  First, we ordered all the appetizers for our table.  Two appetizers came out and the third came out 30 to 45 minutes later after we asked about it twice. When ordering the mains, they only had one main available which was a brisket burger and the rest were the single tacos (aparently, the old chef had left the restaurant and the new chef was going to come up with new mains in a week or two). In addition to a very limited main course menu, some of the appetizer items were not available either (and this was a Saturday night). It would have been nice if they would have mentioned their limited menu when we made our reservation or when we arrived and got seated, so we could have selected another mexican restaurant. The service was lackluster, I think every server working that shift came to our table to repeatedly ask if we had ordered,  yet all the food items (and drinks) took too long to arrive. The whole dinning experience took about 3 hours, which was mostly waiting for our items and beverages. While the prices were not that high, the food did not blow me away: the flavours of the salsas were overpowered by the heat of the peppers (almost inedible) , my side salad was flavourless, my brisket burger was dry (that was the only real main available... I wouldn't necessarily go to a Mexican Joint for a burger, but that seemed like the most filling option and I was hungry), my \"papas bravas\" were just cubed home style fries, etc... Needless to say,  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night date-nite. We arrived around 9 pm and the patio was busy but not full. The host said the servers were overwhelmed on the main patio and offered to seat us on the side patio. In the end we managed to get a seat on the main patio and the ambiance was great. The food was okay. Pretty simple Mexican dishes. Good drink selection although we only drank beer. I think they have some wrinkles to iron out but we'll come back."}
{"text":"This place gets 3 stars for atmosphere and the benefit of the doubt for still being pretty new (although the owner has years of experience in the restaurant industry, so i'm not sure if the pity is warranted). I'll probably try it again in a few months, but if the quality is the same, then i wont come back.  The drink selection is weak -- pretty much just Molson products for beer. I asked for the hopiest beer they had on tap and got something super pale that tasted flat. I didn't order a second. Maybe i'm being picky, but in Toronto i've come to expect some variation in the beer selection -- one local option would be nice. My friends ordered the sangria and the mojito and both tasted watered down.  Food was definitely sub-par. For starters, they we're sold-out of half the menu (which is fine), but what we tried was flavourless and cold. I was also a little annoyed that they had \"Samplers\" on their menu that offered one of every item in that section but offered $0 discount.  I will say that the service was really friendly. It was easy to tell that everyone there was still new but they we're really nice, and certainly put in the effort to do a good job."}
{"text":"Here's the thing: This is one of the nicest patios around. But it's supposed to be a restaurant and the food is just plain bad. Guacamole devoid of flavour; ceviche that appears to be fish floating in dish water (since ceviche is fish \"cold cooked\" in lime juice, shouldn't there be even a faint whiff of citrus?); and a burrito that was passable at best. The passable burrito was served with a fully dressed, crisp, green salad that tasted like - nothing. How is that even possible? The margaritas were okay. So...if you want to enjoy the beautiful patio, by all means go have a drink. Then go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food is really disappointing. Never had a bad restaurant experience like this. The menu looked good but when each dish was served, all 4 people at the table were really disappointed.  I really regret wasting my time and money here.  The guacamole was bland, no salt, like or any flavor. The shrimp ceviche was so nasty. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place. My food came out cold and it tasted horrible so I sent it back. I don't usually send things back. I had a mojito and it didn't have any flavour plus it was on the pricey side for a cocktail - $14. My friends said their tacos were tasteless. The service was mediocre. We waited at the bar for a table and the service there was okay. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks really nice but the food is disgusting! If they only spent more time and money on getting a real Mexican chef and proper servers than this place could have worked.  My husband, mom and 7 month old son walked into the restaurant looking for a table, we were told by one of the servers to sit wherever and as we were approaching the table we had another server tell us rudely that we couldn't sit at one of the six empty tables and we had to wait. It was ridiculous.  The food was tasteless, cold and overpriced food. We got two taco platters. The corn tortillas were cold and were not warmed up properly so it broke apart once you picked it off the plate. The portions were small and not worth $6 each.   I really hope they get their stuff together. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Tried it again. The food is absolutely awful and bland. Pro tip for the owner - go try other Mexican restaurants and copy the food ;)"}
{"text":"Best Barbacoa tacos in Canada! I had 15 years without eat real tacos like we do in my loved Hidalgo. They need to get better Mezcales, they just have Tlacuache. Rice pudding is amazing too! I'm really happy to have real Mexican food in the Leslieville area."}
{"text":"The patio is what really drew us to this place. We ordered a few of everything: guac and chips, tacos, ceviche tostadas, and churros.  Guac and chips: very little guac for the amount of chips. Also, had a very strong lime flavour.  Tacos: We had the chorizo, which wasn't bad, and the fried fish which was subpar. The presentation wad definitely lacking, the fish one looked very bland and underwhelming when we first looked at it.  Ceviche tostada: SO MUCH LIME JUICE. It was honestly so sour that it was pretty much the only thing we could taste.  Churros: really disappointing, we were hoping to get the big fat delicious ones like at El Catrin but they were quite pathetic looking. When they came out we were so confused, with just the tiniest drizzle of caramel.  Bottom line: would probably go there for a drink on the patio, but eat before you go. Definitely disappointed with this new joint :( service was good though, friendly waitress although she could've warned us in advance that the churro batter was \"off\" that day."}
{"text":"Come here on Monday night. We sat in a west side patio. (The east side one looked much prettier but it was closed :( ..) anyway, the food was great. Big portion. Very nice and friendly staff. I don't know why people left such a low rate for this place. I live in the neighbourhood and will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Christine was a fantastic server! Great food and service, try the fish tacos you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I found that the appetizer guacamole was over priced for what I got plus my beef and chorizo burrito was dry. I suppose they want you to buy the sour cream or guac to moisten the dish but that shouldn't be necessary.  The side salad was great!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews. We had a very tasty and fresh meal here. We shared a Mexican street corn. I have never regretted getting Mexican street corn and this time was no different. Cotijo cheese was a little less crumbly than usual but it was so tasty. Blackened corn. Lots of cheese and scallions. Mmmm.   We shared 4 tacos between two. Chorizo was a little spicy and plenty of meat. The fish was a little bland. The carnitas ( pork) was really really good. Moist and tender. The Barbacoa was hands down the best. Very flavourful lamb. The waiter brought a variety of hot sauces to liven things up.... Successfully. We had two pops and water. In all 33$ for two including tip. Portions are small but tasty. Plus you can always order more. Our server was very pleasant. One star off for the food not being very hoyv(temperature wise) I would definitely return. The patio is lovely on a bright evening"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dinner here thoroughly. The patio is lovely- it felt like I was on vacation. I enjoyed yummy Barrio margueritas and ate guacamole and chips and two tacos- a pork and a lamb. All the food was very good. The service was attentive and quick. My only complaint is charging 3 dollars for a tiny ramikin of Pico de Gallo with the guacamole. The Pico should already be included. The atmosphere was fantastic. Will be back. Not sure about the bad reviews."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place a better rating - I've been a couple times and the food is very average, not great but not awful. That was until I experienced breakfast there this morning. The bacon they served us was grey, and I spit it out it tasted so bad. The beans and eggs were cold, and the lettuce looked two weeks old. I was shocked they served us it. My guests also had similar experiences with their food. The server was really nice and did take one of our meals off the bill, as the manager was not on site, however that doesn't negate the poor poor quality of food that was served. Time to switch up whoever is responsible for managing the kitchen if you are to stay in business. Only place in leslieville that wasn't packed this rainy morning for brunch which speaks volumes."}
{"text":"Was really hoping the newly renovated Joy Bistro would bring a solid dining spot to the neighbourhood, with its sprawling patio and multilevel space, it has such potential to be a revered Leslieville staple. Sadly, the food does not deliver.   We sampled a variety of items from the limited menu and nothing we ordered was remotely satisfying or inspired. The dishes were small, simple, and lacking in every way. The real disappointment here is that just a 4 minute walk west is La Carnita, a place that gets tacos right and is consistent in doing so. If you're looking for tasty Mexican fare, start there.   Hoping that Barrio takes a cue from some of the mainstays in the neighbourhood and puts a real focus on the food, as a great patio and space isn't enough to keep locals coming back. Currently, not worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here. The service was friendly and timely.The cocktails are fantasic. The Margarita was delicious. Everything we had not only looked great but was delicious. The watermelon salad was my favourite. The churros were perfect. The one thing I really appreciated was the style (Latin)and volume (low) of the music. It made dinner conversation easy (I didnt have to yell to be heard or struggle to hear others) which in turn meant for a really pleasant dining experience. I was not in any rush to leave. Thanks for a great evening Barrio. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My experience with the food here was very \"meh\".  We ordered the ceviche, guacamole, tacos, octopus and chorizo, and a pork main with chile verde. I also got a margarita caesar.  Things that were good: the guac and the caesar. My sister got two tacos and she was pleased with them but also stated, \"I've had better.\"  The ceviche was not authentic and could have used more lime, however they do give you a large portion's worth.  My octopus and chorizo dish was mediocre. My nubbin of a sausage was overcooked and slightly burnt. The octopus was same. Too many potatoes and green beans- I question the authenticity of this dish.  My husband thought his pork dish was ok, although he didn't eat the fried corn tortilla thing that it was served on.  Verdict: could have spent the money elsewhere and had a more enjoyable eating experience.   The atmosphere and service was nice and the outdoor patio looks like an awesome place to grab a drink during the warmer months."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend are obsessed with Mexican food and often go to El Catrin amongst others for drinks and apps.   We each ordered an 11 dollar margarita each... very mediocre. They took forever and the size was a small mason jar style cup filled with ice. I actually didn't drink mine as I thought it tasted poorly made. The booze/mix ratio was way off.   Next we ordered the guac. It was edible, but bland. I am serious when I say I can make better guacamole at home. We added spices and things in it to try to liven the taste. Portion was also very small.   The fish tacos were next. These were subpar. They were tasty but nothing as delicious as El Catrin or Grand Electric even. For the price it just wasn't worth it. We   The patio is a great place in the summer for drinks and to watch the game, service was friendly after we told them it was our first time."}
{"text":"Went there for a  friends birthday. My friend had to call twice to make the reservation because they kept saying \"we will put you on the list for the upstairs part of the restaurant\". We needed a reso not to be put on a waiting list for a reso. She also wanted to make sure they knew it was for a birthday so we didn't have to remind the server in front of the birthday girl and make it awkward. Then when I arrived, two servers/hostess'? Were having a personal conversation (gossiping) at the front and I just wanted to check in. They both kept their backs faced to me even when I tried to get their attention. I finally had the GM come up to me and got me a table (upstairs).  We ordered the guac and chips and ceviche and got nachos brought to us. Later the server told us that the group in the corner got our order and we got theirs. We were too full from the nachos and only ordered 2 tacos, which were tiny and really not that great for $5 a piece.  The table next to us was also celebrating a birthday and the restaurant dimmed the lights for them and the whole crew sang happy birthday and brought out a special drink. We had the server bring out churros and really sadly and quickly sang happy birthday to the birthday girl. We were charged for the churros. Sorry but awful service and place. No wonder it's changed owners and names 3 times already. Definitely won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Wow the service is bad here.  Tacos are pretty good."}
{"text":"Against my better judgement, I gave Barrio Cerveceria a 2nd chance.  Waste of time and money.   When they first opened, we came for lunch and the customer service and food were so bad that I had to review it...and I don't do that very often.  Today I thought I'd give them another shot, as they're in the neighbourhood, and it's a beautiful sunny day to enjoy the patio.   The Short Version: We paid $50 for 2 beers, 4 tiny tasteless tacos, and a small order of guac & chips.  We left feeling ripped off & hungry, went home and ate a grilled cheese sandwich.  The Long Version: The food is still BLAND and service mediocre. The guac was flavourless and ground to a paste-like consistency.  As for the chips, we could have bought an entire bag of the same brand from Hooked or Rowe Farms, for less that the price we paid at Barrio for a tiny bowlful.  The tacos: Fish, Beef, and Vegetarian/Mushroom, were equally bland. Honestly, how is it possible to make Mexican food so tasteless?? Anyone that says otherwise about this place is missing at least 1/2 their tastebuds.  No spice, and no hot sauces offered to add your own.  The only thing on the table was a pathetic little bottle of cheap powdered spices, which looks like it came from the discount section of No Frills.  Which I assume is where the flavourless corn tortillas came from as well.  For the past 10+ years I've lived a block away from this restaurant. As \"Joy Bistro\" the food was always reliable, the service great, and of course, the major draw in summer is the awesome patio.  I am SO disappointed to learn that the original owner of Joy Bistro is behind this over-priced mediocre place.  Yes, you have a great patio. Does that mean that you can get away with serving crappy food, with crappy service, and premium prices?? Obviously, the owner thinks he can.  I'll continue to support other businesses in the area, but not this one."}
{"text":"Love this area! Reminds me of a place in New York by the flat iron area Great patio Service food!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Great patio. White wine sangria delicious. Had pork, chicken and beef tacos as well as Ceviche (so yum) on the amazing patio."}
{"text":"Really liked it when it was Joy Bistro.  I ate there all the time.  This place sucks.  The guacamole was bland and they charged six bucks for one taco which was ok but not worth the price.  At least give you two for the price.  The wait staff was friendly but unfortunately can't make up for the generic food.  Joy was much better ."}
{"text":"Fantastic and unique Mexican fare. Exceptional margaritas.  Great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"What a beautiful Patio! We were supposed to head to a place close by but they were closed on Labor Day and I'm so pleased the circumstances turned that way! It's a Mexican place with amazing Latin beats!   We ordered to share; 3 different types of tacos (would recommend the chicken and fish), chips and guacamole, watermelon salad (amazing but would prefer it without onion) and quesadilla (a must try, not a regular serving)!   As for drinks I ordered one of the beer cocktails ( menchelada) ! I wasn't able to finish it, personally I'm not fan of bloody marry and it's so similar to it.   The service was great! Fast, clean and friendly!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has an overall low starts rating 'cause me and my gals had a gay old time! They take resos for brunch; coffee was regularly refilled; hostess kept checking in on us; servings we're large; outdoor patio scene is great! Also, the food was yummy! I got the Mexican breakfast. Make sure you ask for the hot sauce to kick it up a notch. My girls and I shared the French toast and that was yummy too! Only realized yelp gives a 10% discount after the fact on your meal so I guess I will need to come back another day!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited about this place because of the amazing patio, but the food is atrocious. Ordered one of each taco as well as the scallop tostada and did not want to take more than one bite of any. The scallops were especially bad, not remotely fresh, and I'm fairly certain they were the culprit to the illness experienced after eating at Barrio. Chips and guacamole were mediocre, I would order them if I go back for drinks on the patio but would never order any other food here again."}
{"text":"I passed by this place so many times, then decided to go in on a very cold snowy day looking to warm up on some good Latin food! Well, I wasn't warmed very much. The best way to describe this place is mediocre.... that's for the food and the service. We got the ceviche, which was just ok. Has shrimp and fish but the sauce was a little too much orange juice. We also had the soup, quinoa salad, beef and chicken tacos. Again... all just mediocre. I was hoping the margarita would make things better, but nope... just mediocre. I think our server wasn't too keen on the food either because every time we asked his opinion he said he didn't like the dish we were asking about.   The place looks cool and they have private event space so I would go back to hang out with friends but not for the food."}
{"text":"Cold tacos, lacking in flavour. Think twice about going here! The servings were also on the small side, and truly might have been a bit more tasty if they were served warm!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled across this joint for a night cap, and were so impressed!! We had the rose sangria and the passion fruit margarita. Both were incredibe and unlike any tradition cocktail. I will advise you to get the passion fruit margarita, and be prepared for a wonderful surprise."}
{"text":"Patio was the draw for this location and didn't know it had new ownership. Loved the decor and ambiance. Service was friendly and attentive. Only wanted a snack and drinks which were perfect although pricey. Would consider this a rest stop on a late afternoon in the summer but not sure after the other reviews if we'd chance a dinner at the high prices to be disappointed. We shared guac & chips, chorizo taco (you only get 1 - alright size), fish ceviche tostada. Had a really tasty red sangria (I asked them to hold the fruit chunks which was not a problem for them) and a beer."}
{"text":"I love this place because the Mexican food is delicious and not greasy. The nachos are probably the best I've had and I'm from New York where there is ample Mexican fare! The service was slow at first but then was really attentive. The ambiance is good the resto was full and buzzing but not too loud.  The churro she were perfectly cooked and not dry the inside was soft which is how authentic chirps should be. Great casual spot I loved how we didn't have to worry about lines or a reservation. It's sad the reviews are so low thankfully I didn't look at reviews prior and stopped in because of the cute patio."}
{"text":"Great patio for the summer.  Maybe open in the winter too? Both the bar and wait staff were very knowledgeable and friendly.  The food was all good.  Many vegetarian options.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Who knew Mexican food could be so bland?   Our sever (also the manager) was one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. HOWEVER, that doesn't make up for the fact that the ceviche and Mexican breakfast were incredibly bland, there was a 15-20 minute delay between my food and my wife's food reaching our table, and the dessert we were promised to make up for the delay never arrived. Eventually, we just paid the bill and left. Extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Didn't eat here, just drinks on the patio. Service was very nice but nothing spectacular, definitely a few avoidable hiccups (not letting us pay in a timely fashion, we asked for wifi password with little follow up).  Drinks come cutely presented in mason jars, and were mostly tasty (mine was too sweet - a peach drink). I liked the patio but it felt like they seated cool kids on one patio and families/uncool kids on another patio, so I didn't like the vibe."}
{"text":"This may be unfair as it is only their first week  We very much looked forward to Mexican in the neighborhood. We waited with anticipation for it to open.   The room looks very nice with the mural on the wall.   If they work out the kinks in the service, from greeting to check, and make food that is tasty, and half as expensive, it may work out. Chances are slim  We had a 7pm reservation. When we arrived, there were empty tables for four, that stayed empty our whole stay, but we still had to wait while they moved a table for two to the centre of the room, right in the middle of the servers path. We chose a table on the very nondescript west side patio.   There was lots of staff, but few doing anything. This made the long wait for our server to arrive a bit annoying. We ordered drinks and food.  We were told the crowd of servers were trainees. The table set up was a wooden box filled with sauces and knifes and forks wrapped in serviettes  The server suggested our mains were a lot of food, so dissuaded us from ordering appetizers. This was ironic as the portions are small and expensive. The tacos were small, the tortillas falling apart when folded. There was nothing good about the fillings. The tostadas were deep fried. The meager fillings of those were okay.   Still hungry, we ordered an app we didn't recognize. We hope nobody else indulges their curiosity to get those plastic wagon wheels. They came with lime and hot sauce, at least on the menu. A lime wedge, and the hot sauce from that already on the table  After our mains were half done, our drinks arrived. A syrupy margarita and flavorless sangria.   The server never returned to freshen our drinks. She did bring extra napkins to wipe our hands from the taco filling that fell out of the shredded tortillas  To her credit, the server did apologize for the lousy service. One can't ask her to take the blame for the lousy food  The crowds suggest the neighborhood is hungry for Mexican food. If you want good stuff, head a few kilometers west to Cocina Economica. If you want your money's worth for bad \"mexican\", head to Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Was convinced by a neighbour to join for a beer. Oddly her husband hated the place as much as I did the first go round.  I've upped the rating as the taco I had was a real taco! Plenty of filling and flavour.  The guac and chips are good, but for $10 you could serve enough chips to finish the guac. A bowl rather than a tin mug.   Service still lacking unfortunately, even though it wasn't busy. Nice kid, but needed some reminding. Like menus 10 mins after you've been seated. Or asking if I'd like another drink when my glass has been empty and you've walked passed 4 times.  Goes to show, first impressions count. A year lost of my business and poor word of mouth. I live across the street essentially and have avoided this place like the plague.  Still needs some work and I'm hopeful they get there."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place...one star for the patio. Not sure how they'll do in the winter. FOURTEEN BUCKS for a margarita a little bigger than a shot? Come one. I was stunned when she brought it to the table. All ice, seriously, 2 or 3 sips, I was done. That totally turned me off. Then we ordered the guac, beans, and chips to start. Beans were pretty good, guac was pretty standard fair. I had the cactus and cheese huarache tortilla which was bland, with what was more like a green pepper than cactus, and a very dull processed mozzarella. I wont even mention the cardboard it was presented on. We had the fish tacos, which was way more fry than fish on cold corn tortillas. Really people? How about a nice grilled white fish, warm that taco up a bit and throw in some freaking tops for SIX bucks a taco. Owners, cooks might want to take a look at La Carnita down the street for some inspiration. This place is just so bad and so overpriced. Never again."}
{"text":"Came here first time for brunch on a Sunday, service and food were really good, didn't understand why it has such a relatively bad rating. Second time came same time on a Sunday, it took 45 mins to get the food and it was not nearly busy. Not cool. They have good vibe and food but poor management. Not consistent"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Portions are small and no flavour. Service was good but couldn't compensate for downright terrible food"}
{"text":"Came in from out of town and this place was super close to where we were staying. On a popular street in the neighborhood. Pro : Patio  Drinks  Ambience  Con : Super small tacos especially for 5-7 each  Once we sat took our server like 15 min to bring water but she was pretty overloaded on tables ( she was super sweet and prompt so not really a con just an eh )  We will be back probably before we leave cause the mojito was amazing !"}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  The patio here is awesome and it's a perfect place to hang out with friends on a warm summer day. We were seated right away (no reservation) and our waiter came over almost instantly so we got our drinks very quickly - my kind of place already.   I had a margarita, which was decent. Not the best I've ever had but far from the worst. We ordered a number of different tacos, which were all delicious. I have additional allergies so I needed to omit certain ingredients, which they had no problem doing. When I was ordering I asked if the tacos were gluten-free and the waiter said they were and specifically said they were celiac friendly. I didn't inquire into whether they prepare them in separate food stations to prevent cross contamination since I don't require that, so if you have celiac's disease be sure to confirm this. I had no reactions to the food.  There were 2 downsides, which is why they lost a star. First I asked for no avocado for my tacos because I was allergic, which I specifically told the waiter. We also ordered the ceviche, which we didn't realize had avocado in it, and the waiter didn't warn us. So I ended up only being able to eat the three pieces of fish at the top that weren't touching the avocado sauce at the bottom of the dish. Second, they did not have any gluten-free desserts. :(    Overall, great food and vibe. I'll definitely be going back.   TL;DR - tacos are celiac friendly, no gluten-free dessert"}
{"text":"First time here: food took 1.25 hours to arrive. The food was inconsistent and certainly should not have taken over an hour. The time we waited for our food the other tables had turned.   Appetizers were bland. We ordered the stuffed jalepenos which were stuffed with nothing. They were just fried and lacked flavour. Also ordered chips with 3 dips. Chips had no flavour and the dips were perhaps the tastiest part of the meal.   Mains were underwhelming. Fish and vegetarian tacos had no flavour despite being dressed with their \"creme\" and cheese. Huevos Rancheros was tasty with the beans had a nice sauce.  Service was inconsistent. The mains did not arrive at the same time for our party of 6 and there was no update on our meals after 30 minutes of waiting - we had to ask twice. What saved the service and his review from 1 star is they comped the drinks and sauces because we had to wait so long."}
{"text":"It really hurts me to give this place a 3 star rating.   I've walked past Barrio numerous times and admired their beautifully lit patio. I finally made it there early September around 10 pm for a bite. We found a cozy spot on the patio and it was just how I pictured it. Since it was getting late, things were slowly winding down. It wasn't too busy, so I was quite surprised that it took about 10 minutes for someone to notice us. We were ready to order, but you can only imagine how frustrating it is when the server bolts after only taking your drink order, before you can get in a word about your meal!   Anyway, when the drinks arrived, we made sure to submit our food orders. I ordered the tortilla soup, and my friend got the Alambre bowl with chicken. The soup hit the spot, just delicious. The roast chicken Alambre bowl however, was a bit too salty. I only had a taste of it, but I wouldn't order that.   What WAS really good though, were the cocktails. I can't remember what mine was called... but it had smoked chilli inside. It was margarita-like, but made with whiskey I think. I had two of those, and they were amazing! I'll definitely make another trip down to Barrio, and hopefully the service will be a bit better."}
{"text":"Outstanding Mexican food and very professional service in a pleasant environment!....one of my favourites around this hood.."}
{"text":"Jamie was the best. She had great reccomendations on food and drinks. We really enjoyed the patio.  Food was super good!"}
{"text":"Great patio with awesome music yet can still be intimate. Food was great. Highly recommend the chips and guacamole. Chips have free refills"}
{"text":"We sat down on the patio and were admittedly impressed at how nice it was and were excited for the shady option this summer.   The waiter was super nice and attentive.  The downsides were mainly portion sizes, food quality, and value.  The tacos were tiny, nothing special, and for $15 each my husband and I both left hungry.   They are going to have to tweak the pricing on their tacos, either that or make them come with a side when you are obviously ordering them as an entree.    We asked for a tiny slice of avocado to keep our 7 month old infant peaceful.   I was pleased when instead they brought a big chunk, half a large avocado.   Then less pleased when I realized they charged us $4 for it.   Didn't realize plain avocados cut in half cost that much.  Probably won't be going back unless just for drinks on their patio.  My husband's gin and tonic was at least tasty."}
{"text":"I rarely have issues with restaurants.  I like all kinds of food and will eat almost anything.  Even the crappiest places usually get no more than a \"meh\" from me.  But I was so put off by this restaurant that I'm compelled to write a review.  The food was honestly horrendous.  I ordered the tuna tostada and while the presentation was nice, it tasted so \"off\".  A really unappetizing and sour mix of flavours.  I ate 3/4 of the (small) dish (not normal for me, as I'll usually finish) and couldn't have any more.  I also felt sick a couple of hours later; my face turned beet red, my heart was racing and there was an urgent trip to the bathroom.  I ended up leaving work.  I can't definitively say that it was related to the food, but a strange coincidence.  This place is trying to be La Carnita but it doesn't even come close.  It pales in comparison to almost any other Mexican in the City.  Not only is it late to the Mexican trend, its execution is awful.  This beautiful building and awesome location could house something SO MUCH better - hopefully soon it will."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure why this place has been poorly rated. I was so impressed with the food, drinks and the patio! I found the service to be a little slow but I like that at times, not feeling rushed to turn our table over as quickly as possible. The nachos were delicious and my fish tacos were full of flavour and authentic tasting. The Caesar is one of the best I've ever had!   I think the restaurant started off a but slow and rough when they opened which probably led to the poor reviews but trust me when I say this, give it a go! The prices are on point, the menu has great options and the atmosphere is a perfect summer's night out!"}
{"text":"Went here for Winterlicious lunch and the Mexican cuisine is delicious.  Friendly staff and we never felt rushed. Definitely check it out if you are a fan of high quality Mexican food."}
{"text":"I came in on a weekend night with my sister a couple weeks ago. It was a wonderful experience!  The servers are all friendly, attentive and efficient.   The food was great! I had a few tacos and the spicy rice- forgot what it's called.   I'm surprised of all the bad reviews. I was on a time crunch and they understood and delivered what I had asked for.   I'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for Mexican food and was convinced when I saw they served queso Oaxaca. I ordered the burrito de la ciudad and was very impressed! The food was authentic, it's the number one thing I look for from a Mexican restaurant. The Valentina hot sauce and Tajin had me convinced the chef was Mexican, but turns out he's not (I asked). The waitress, who was very attentive, said they've had some turnover. I didn't ask if they intended to change the menu with the new chef but I hope they don't change too much, I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Stumbled here and was pleasently surprised. The menu was limited but the food was well made. We had an assortment of tacos which were all great.  A nice selection of sauces on the table too.    The patio was beautiful and had a nice graffiti-art component as well.  The staff were all pleasant. Great find on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Brunch: asked for hard eggs, still got runny, server said \"I know, sorry\" instead of offering to fix or ring new ones. I found the servers smelled like cigarettes and heavy perfume. Seats were dirty had to ask for sever to wipe. I NEVER complain but when there's more than one thing, it's warranted."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night. Lee served us tasty tequila shots and Juanita made us AMAZING guacamole. Had a great time."}
{"text":"I went on Friday night and got to sit on the beautiful patio outside. Jamie was our server and she was very attentive and accommodating to our dietary needs. Also!! It was a little chilly that night and she offered us blankets for our entire meal. Food and drinks were delicious, Jamie was amazing...would come again!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. Service was good and staff friendly. Had the corn for starters then a number of different tacos for main. I have to say I was really surprised at how bland the food was. There was very little flavour. Also both my partner and I ordered corn for starters which turned into 4 pieces, I would have appreciated if they had told me it was 2 pieces per person."}
{"text":"Was here on a beautiful sunny Saturday afternoon and wanted a drink and snack.  However at 4:00 pm they don't offer appetizers.  Only a very limited brunch.  We ask if they could at least make us nachos.   But that would be too difficult for the kitchen?  So we walked out.    What a poor idea of Mexican Food this place thinks they are doing."}
{"text":"Decided to try Barrio last night with 3 friends.  Couldn't make a reservation beforehand so we added our name to the list with the hostess and patiently waited for our table.  Our name was eventually called 20 min later and the hostess took us to the patio bar and said we could have a drink while we wait for our table.  A couple of us had the sangria (one had white and I had red) and even though we were at the bar we were chatting and not paying attention to watching the bartender.  We both swear we could taste tequila in our sangria.  Overall, their sangria is mediocre - the white is definitely better than the red and I love red wine. Not cool at $12 a glass. Other friend had a glass of red wine that was full of fruit flies.  The bartender uncorked a fresh bottle and still did not cork it after pouring a new glass.  This is an outdoor patio - cork it!  Another friend had a Mojito and said it was bland.  Rip off at $14 a glass.  We also ordered a plate of nachos and guacamole while we sat at the bar ($8).  Pretty good.  Nachos were crispy and the guac was chunky and flavourful.  Unfortunately the hostess seemed to have forgotten about us!  After repeated follow-ups, and 30 min later, we were sat at a table.  We ordered right away.  It still took another 30 min for us to receive our meals.  I had 3 tacos - the pulled pork, chorizo and beef.  All three were terrible.  The shells fell apart the minute you picked them up and they were bland and flavourless.  Terrible at $6 a taco.  Friends thought the same with their tacos.  One sent her tostadas back cuz is was cold.  Apparently it is served cold at this restaurant.  Maybe they should mention it is \"chilled\" on the menu.  Overall I would not recommend this place.  The food and cocktails are overpriced and bland.  Plenty of other restaurants in Leslieville to dine at and if you're craving tacos there is another establishment 5 min down the street which is way better."}
{"text":"We came here as a group of 20 to celebrate a birthday and overall, the food and drinks were awesome! The only reason I'm not giving it 5/5 is the margaritas were on the pricier side for the quantity but they were amazing nonetheless...the whole table just kept them coming. The 'Show Me The Passion' margarita comes with a flaming shot of tequila on top. Most of the table ordered flautas de pollo or enchiladas. I personally thought the enchiladas with verde sauce were tastier than the flautas and more filling because it came with rice on the side. The corn tortillas were delish, tasted authentic. I will be back to try their guacomole which is raved about. Nice place for a large group as well as they have a 2nd floor and a big patio out on the side. The ambience was great too, we enjoyed seeing the flamenco paintings. Good spot!"}
{"text":"Mediocre and bland food. I didn't even finish my tacos - and I love tacos. We got the taco platter to try them all and they all lacked flavour and the corn tortillas kept breaking. Not only were they boring and tasteless, they didn't have enough filling. There are dozens of fantastic taco restaurants in Toronto; this is not one of them."}
{"text":"When you see the owners switch up the corner that had been Joy Bistro for all these years, there's a part of me that says, \"ooh, Leslieville's getting spicy!,\" and another that says, \"ugh cashing in on the Mexican trend sweeping the city eh.\"  Barrio Cerveceria on Queen East I find to be a refreshing experience overall from what it used to be. There's still that west patio facing the park, the upstairs party space, and the east lot patio, spiced up with its own bar and a fireplace. It is the latter patio where you really want to be on a warm day hanging with friends, it's coated with atmosphere.  Service was very friendly but a bit much--it wasn't that busy but I swear I was being served by three different folks. The portion of their overall tasty grub is smaller than I'd hope, but some of it sure pack a bigger punch than I thought. The pollo frito taco ($6) was unsuspectingly packing mega heat and I didn't have to add any hot sauce. All in all, not so bad a place, really."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 vegetarian tacos needing them to be as described on menu, ie-- with salsa verde, esquites and fried mushrooms. Instead I was given deep fried parsley, wheat battered cheese cauliflower balls and queso fresca. I'm allergic to wheat and cheese so the substitution was not appreciated and I couldn't eat it. there wasn't even anything on the menu resembling what was given to me. That said, the guacamole and salsa fresca I also ordered were excellent, and I think their food is likely quite good. Nachos too greasy, though -- use an air fryer or bake them. I just wish I got to try more of their food since I think it's likely quite good.  Edit: corn tortillas not gluten free here! One star down for that and not telling you on the menu. They're a combo of corn/ wheat. GF folks better to order from Tacos 101."}
{"text":". We waited for an hour for our food and the servers are super not attentive, having called them multiple times for water and coffee and no show or forgot.  After talking to them the food finally came . The food was so so to be honest, would have been better eating at Cora's instead.  When the bills came, and we were paying, the server gave us a shot of something . By then we've lost most of the appetite and mood. Definitely needs a lot of improvement if there's room for that"}
{"text":"Surprised about the low reviews here on yelp. We had a great experience and will definitely be back. Brunch with sangrias was amazing. Three of us had different meals - each was a mix of a typical brunch item with a Mexican twist and ingredients. We even got an extra serving of nachos without having to ask for our guac (which does not happen at other Mexican restaurants). Very good food and experience!"}
{"text":"Was very surprised by the less than 3 star review for this place. I stopped by, just because of the cute patio and beautiful weather. I then checked in on Yelp to find out what's good here. Protip: check-in here for 10% off, super easy to redeem with out server.   Decent/average prices for typical Mexican fare - personally I wouldn't come here for the food or drinks, but worth a try just once for the patio!   Poblano Soup ($10) - was a bit watery, no kick at all, and too many chips. However, it was flavorful and if you like milder soups this may be the one.   Casuela + chorizo ($12 + 3) - DIY tacos!! Super cool and would be great for date night. Lots of cheese so love. However, taste doesn't stand out and not sure if the novelty is worth it.   Tacos ($5 to 6 each) - Pretty decent. Nothing too special and definitely not as good as Seven Lives or La Carnitas which also offer them for $5 to 6 as well.   Patio was great, gets great sunlight straight until the evening. Server was even better, very attentive and sweet (sorry forgot your name for a s/o!).   I don't think I'll be stopping by again with all the other cool places in Leslieville, or if I'm craving Mexican/drinks. Other places that are much better for the price, or cheaper for same quality (in my opinion)."}
{"text":"I will say the Food is amazing here and that is why I can look past the price.  To quote my friend, \"omg, that drink is amazing\" Re: Rasbery Mojito.  My drink, show me the passion, also amazing and boozy.  Tacos - street (flank), carnitas and tinga (braised beef) ALL AMAZING  Roast chicken burrito bowl - can be described as extremely flavourful and each bite is a flavour train entering your mouth. Guacamole, rice, refried beans, pico de Gallo. WOW  They have two patios, one is nicer than the other.  Would return/10"}
{"text":"Divine patio, excellent service and great food. I came here with a group that should have annoyed any wait staff. 15 people, coming and going, different cheques, some ordering food, some not. The staff could not have been more gracious and helpful. The patio location around the fire pit was perfect for a fall night. Drinks and food were great (albeit nachos are avant garde) for my taste."}
{"text":"The only reason why it's busy- the patio!   Food and service is average!  Don't go with high expectations...  could be so much more!"}
{"text":"Poor and overpriced. Prices were close to the ones you can find at El Catrin in Distillery District and not nearly as good.  I ordered chicken tacos and they did not have chicken and offered duck instead. I ended up having beef tacos and the beef was very fatty. Our appetizer was supposed to be a sort of sauce served with tortilla chips but it was imposible to eat since it had the consistency of a soup.  Drinks were OK and food was little bit less than average. For Mexican food go somewhere else. For this price try El Catrin or La Carnita.  Would not go back, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent vibe in a happening neighbourhood. Nice interior. Haven't checked the upstairs yet.   The food is very, very good. I'm more drawn to the tacos than the burritos having tried both.  Service/wait staff is hit and miss but the food more than makes up for it.   Wine choices are pretty good. Dessert choices good too.   All in all, definitely worth checking out. I've been here twice. Will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for brunch to change things up a bit. The steak and eggs was decent...quite tasty, but lacked that grill flavour I love so much. The Sangria was refreshing, but I like their margaritas better. The outdoor patio is lovely, if you like full sun. A table in the shade is available, if  you're lucky and want one. Service is on the slow side so be prepared to chill.., have another margarita or a pitcher...that always helps."}
{"text":"I've been to Barrio a couple times now and I have nothing but love for this place. I've taken my all of my friends here, including those out of town visiting from Montreal, and they were all happy with the food and service at Barrio.   First of all, I love that it's on Queen St E. Easily accessible with a quick streetcar ride from the downtown core. It can get quite busy on some days and you'll have to settle for the quieter and less vibrant patio but nevertheless, the food and drinks are worth the visit. If you really wanted a spot in their highly demanded patio, I suggest you visit in the middle of the week where the wait isn't as crazy as it is on the weekend.   In terms of food and drink, I love their burrito bowl!! For such a simple dish, they manage to get all the right flavour combinations in one dish. It's a burrito bowl. It's not meant to be over complicated. It's simply tasty. This is coming from a guy who usually gets quickly bored with burrito bowls. It looks small but absolutely filling!  I love their Sangria here!! For sure, it's kinda pricey. 10$/glass but after a long of day of work, I don't mind. The sangria uses some of the strongest red wines that I've tasted. The mix is most certainly fruity and sweet but doesn't completely dilute the wine.    All in all, this place has done me no wrong! Looking forward for my next visit :)"}
{"text":"Food and drink were really great! We sat out back on the heated patio and it's was a really nice setup. Jamie was an amazing server, friendly, and made great suggestions!"}
{"text":"I was here on a Saturday night for winterlicious and the restaurant had a lovely atmosphere at that time. We were greeted at the door and promptly seated upstairs. Overall, the servers were attentive and unlike what many of the reviews here say, service was relatively quick.  Chips and quac: the guacamole was delicious but I would have preferred if they had lessened the amount of oil added on top  Tacos: we tried a braised beef taco that was flavourful and tender, a fried chicken taco that had a good amount of spice, and a fish taco that was mediocre in comparison as the sauce didn't do much to compliment the fish  Churros: these were great!"}
{"text":"Rare Friday night out without the kid, husband and I decided to eat here last minute.  Empty restaurant on arrival, seated immediately.  Downhill from here.  Food is actually very good, well made, fresh and flavourful.  But the service is terrible, seems not to have improved from the summer when they opened.  Our order was not written down and 40 minutes after our last course arrived we decided to leave without the final order we'd made.  When the bill came we discovered that they'd not even recorded it so we'd wasted time for nothing.  The fellow we spoke to was apologetic but it fell flat.  We spent $50+ on two drinks, two tacos, corn and chips and guac.  My husband left hungry.  I don't think we'll be back and don't recommend this place at all for the service, unless it improves."}
{"text":"Came for brunch with a large party. Service had a lot more to he desired but food was delicious.  Staff: We had made a reservation but they only had one staff member for the first hour we were there. After which there were four servers which helped a lot more. Understandably, the server was overwhelmed and slow with a packed house. Service was friendly though.  Ambience: It's not a large place, but it's bright and the music is vibrant. There's plenty of free street parking so that's a plus.  Food: I has the churro French toast and it was mighty delicious. I could it it for days! I also had a fish taco; it was spicy (for me, which doesn't say much) but still delicious. It was crispy and tasty.  I'd come back, plus it's nice to be more east and away from downtown."}
{"text":"Upon entering, my dining partner and I stood waiting. After a few moments were greeted by a man who lead us to our seats by the entrance of the patio; definitely not prime seating,  despite the low number of customers.   After waiting several minutes for waitstaff to greet us, provide a menu, and offer water, I lost patience and went back in the main dining area to request service. I caught the attention of a hostess who gave the poor excuse that they \"didn't see us.\"  Anyway, our waitress Christina was attentive and polite; satisfactory service.  We ordered the Guacamole del Barrio (guacamole and nachos) to share; for mains I ordered the Pierna Adoboda a la Cerverza (lamb shank) and the Barrio brew, while my partner ordered the Michoacán Carnitas taco.  The guac was satisfactory; pleasant but nothing extraordinary. My dining partner noted the slight greasiness of the nachos.   Their Barrio brew is a refreshing light ale; a step above the typical domestic light ales and reasonably priced.  The lamb shank was savory, falling off the bone with a slight graze from my fork. The potatoes were cooked perfectly, but the rice was a bit hard.  My dining partner didn't enjoy their taco; in their words, the tortilla left much to be desired. I tried the taco's pork, which was oddly seasoned with either too much salt or lime, and had a grainy and dry texture...  As for the washrooms... There are two single unit unisex washrooms and a third accessibility washroom. The washrooms seem lazily kept; the toilet roll was replaced but I had to spin and dig for the first piece of paper, and the sink was clogged!!   In sum, I won't be returning... Toronto offers many family-owned and run Latinx restaurants, and in my opinion Barrio offers no competition."}
{"text":"Don't let the pretty patio fool you. Terrible food and terrible service. Go down the street to La Carnita instead."}
{"text":"Amazing service, neat drinks, wonderful service. Welcoming neighbourhood atmosphere. Such a great addition.  Outdoor bar? How can you go wrong?  Great patio too."}
{"text":"I can't see how people were leaving bad reviews for this place! The service was great and the food was incredible! We had three tacos, $5 each on Thursdays. The fried chicken taco with mango salsa was a burst of flavour and did not leave me disappointed in any way. The fish taco was absolutely amazing as well. Our catch of the day was cod, and it was perfectly fried. The braised lamb taco is also quite delicious and certainly worth trying. We also had the Gordita. It was my absolute favourite thing out of what we ordered and I very highly recommend it! Overall, my boyfriend and I both agreed that Barrio was a great place to have a dinner date and we will come back for future dates as well as with friends and family. :)"}
{"text":"Decided to try Barrio. Wish I didn't.  Service: Unfriendly staff with poor ability to both get us seated and to recommend/explain dishes and drinks.   Food: Easily the worst Mexican I've had in the city. My steak was incredibly undercooked (basically raw) and when explaining this to the waiter I received a \"I think that is how it comes\"  Recognize it's a new establishment, but certainly a blemish in the great lineup of other restaurants that Leslieville has to offer.  Go to La Carnita instead."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I ever had, and I'm Mexican. I love the guacamole sooo much! Everything was knocked out of the park. Service, taste, and decor all on point! Will be back next time in the barrio!"}
{"text":"Service: I've been here a couple of times - it depends on how busy they are, but on average pretty attentive and good service, no complain  Drinks: they have a pretty good selection on their drinks menu, and also offer non alcoholic drinks!   Food: I've tried their Nachos, Burrito Bowl (forgot which one), and chips and 3 dips (guac, salsa, retried beans).  Nothing was ever mind blowing, but their nachos and dips are definitely GREAT to my likings! The chips are made fresh in the house and are always golden and crispy (can also be very addictive...), also a generous amount of nachos toppings and well seasoned dips.  Overall: they also have daily special offers for tacos and drinks, and outdoor patios on 2 sides! It's not somewhere I'd go for dinner because of the noise and bar vibe, but that's just me. I'd definitely come here again sometime for some drinks, chips, and chill!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fun place to host your next party with great food, atmosphere and Latino music, this is it!   We went to Barrio last night for my friend's bday dinner and we had a fantastic time. I didn't eat dinner there but the reviews from my friend's were quit positive. Our server was super attentive, always made sure we have everything we needed rather it's food or booze and we were a party of 30 people.  We pretty much occupied the entire second floor so we can be as loud as we wanted without fearing disturbing other resto patrons. After a certain time, I think it was around 10pm, they turn up the music and we got the entire floor to practice our mediocre salsa moves. Scorrrrre  The only disappointment of the night was my mojito, it was wayyyyy too sweet."}
{"text":"I usually avoid going to restaurants when they have less than 3 stars on Yelp, but after walking by the cutest patio ever at this place, I had to give it a try!  To be honest, I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews for this spot, as I had a great experience!  The patio was gorgeous, the service was great and the food/margaritas were delicious!  I  highly recommend the watermelon salad!!  Don't let some of the negative reviews stop you from giving this restaurant a try, it turned out to be a great girl's night!"}
{"text":"Went for some cocktails and light fare with my girlfriend. We sat on the side patio, was had ceviche and guacamole...both very good! The servers were attentive, and we also got churros on the house from (who I assumed) to be the manager. Outside of our server, he came around many times to check on us and ask how things were tasting etc. Pleasantly surprised given the help review."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Barrio during their $5 \"tasting,\" during the Jazz festival weekend before their soft opening on July 15th. We ordered their taco, torta, churros, and quesadilla during the Jazz weekend tasting. We enjoyed it so much, that we went back to Barrio during their soft opening weekend (July15-17th).   We we're happily surprised that they finished the Reno on time for their soft opening, for the inside looks quite bare the weekend beforehand. We sat down and ordered chorizo huarache, pibil chicken torta, mushroom and cactus taco (nopal and mushroom), quesadilla, shrimp tostadas, and the rice pudding.  Overall the service was good, and obviously certain things are still being ironed out at Barrio. We spoke to a guy, probably one of owners or floor manager. He mentioned that the menu they have right now aren't the full menu. He said the menu will be more extensive during grand opening, and a prospect of brunch once things are settled.   We can't wait to see the full menu, and can't wait to see them serving brunch!"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure why this place has such low reviews but I definitely enjoyed my experience here !  They have 2 patios - one for sunshine and the other one is right underneath some lights so it gives a pretty romantic feel for a date night,  did I mention there's also a campfire?!  I think I just found my new hangout spot - margaritas are down right delicious! They have 14 different kinds, anything from savoury to sweet to fruity to Smokey to spicy ! If you want to cut the sugar and only go for the straight up tequila,  they have that too!  I love how you can either have communal tapas style here. I enjoyed every part of my meal - Highly recommend the melted casuela cheese with chorizo and ceviche to start.   The tacos are quite small so it was nice to able to order a few different ones to try. They got anything from beef brisket,  steak, pork, fish ,and even lamb!!!!  I left extremely satisfied and content. Definitely will come back!!!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced. Probably the best Mexican food I have gotten in toronto. Apparently there's a new patio opening for the summer. Nice place"}
{"text":"Had 2 decent experiences here, one pretty bad one.  To start, one time the entire patio was empty, we had reservations and the hostess sits us in the back corner. All we could smell was the rotting garbage that must be hidden behind the wooden fence at the back. It was nauseating.   Third time. Our server had horrible timing skills - we received 8 tamales (which were NOT good, no flavour, bland, and cold) and nachos all before we were even able to receive our drinks, a vodka soda, 3 beers, and one margarita.   He took 25% off of our bill after I was willing to mention something, but made no effort to apologize otherwise."}
{"text":"Just leaving here. Great place. The ambience is warm and friendly. I went when it was slow, but I'm told the place hops. The manager, Richard, served me. Very friendly and personable. Drinks were amazing. Calamari was great. Cornmeal crust was a bit salty, but not overcooked.   I would definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"Ignore the completely unfounded negative reviews - I visited Barrio Cerveceria this evening with my family and we all absolutely loved it - We were already big fans of Queen East's acclaimed 'La Carnita' but decided to give this place a try because of their fantastic patio - We were slightly apprehensive due to some negative reviews we had read about the food and service, but after enjoying a round of drinks and almost the full menu between us I honestly cannot understand how anybody could have anything but praise for this delicious selection of tacos, appetisers and desserts  - My advice would be not to let other people's questionable opinions put you off and try it for yourself, I suspect you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The place was great. Great service and delicious food. I tried the fish taco and the portion was really generous. 5 stars. We had a great time."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for drinks and a quick app before a show . Classic margaritas were on special so that drew us in.  Our server was really sweet and if i was ever in the area again i would certainly try out the menu."}
{"text":"Can I give less than 1 Star...?  I know they've only been open for a couple of weeks, but this ain't their (owners) 1st kick at the can, as far as restaurants go. Service was mediocre, at best; drinks were bland; food looked like it had been thrown together with no care, whatsoever. Yet another crappy restaurant in Toronto... Don't waste your money or time with this place. If you want Mexican, head down the street to La Carnita for better...EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"My favourite taco joint in the city. Best patio, only El Catrin compares in that regard but El Barrio has the best tacos in the city, hands down."}
