{"text":"We ordered delivery on a night we didn't want to go out based on the reviews. This was not good! It came hot but the crust tasted like it was previously frozen. The wings tasted like someone threw hot sauce on a rotisserie chicken. This won't be somewhere we order from again. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have been coming here since I was a kid.  The pizza is fantastic.  Their calzones are amazing as well.  If you are in the area, you need to stop by and try their food.  The staff is really friendly as well."}
{"text":"Devitos makes one of the best pizzas and Greek salads I've ever had.  Good for pick up. 
Lots of good flavor!
Very friendly people!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years.  I don't eat all over the menu.  The pizza isn't my favorite type of pizza.  I always get two things, the Greek salad and the Italian sub w/ feta cheese.  The Greek salad is out of this world with fresh lettuce, olives, tomatoes, dressing, and feta cheese.  The sub bread is soft and tasty.  This place always makes me feel good afterwards and I love seeing the same folks there as they recognize us.  

Not every place makes everything great.  Though the things that Di Vito's does well are worth the drive every time."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mama's special and it was delicious. Fresh taste, much more like pizzeria pizza than the major chains. Quick and friendly service and inexpensive for the quality. I definitely would pick DiVito's over any of the other pizza options in my area."}
{"text":"Such a nice guy and amazing food!!! The lasagna is so delicious and filling and the garlic bread is great! Definitely ordering from here again next time I'm craving really good Italian :)"}
{"text":"Hands down the very best pizza!  We were so excited to find out that they delivered to our east Scottsdale home.   The owner is extremely nice and really appreciates his longtime and new customers,"}
{"text":"Quality & Gross Factor = not a good choice

We sampled pizza, ravioli, garlic bread, salad. Ravioli was pretty good, although it included meatballs which was a little strange. Pizza was largely lacking flavor and undercooked. Very mediocre. 

Gross factor: cashier took and processed credit card and register then took his ungloved hands and worked the pizza dough. That was bad enough but then a trip to the one and only bathroom revealed zero soap and no towels. YUCK."}
{"text":"Been coming here since it opened, way back in the 70's.  Amin is a great guy and he truly respects his customers and has become a good friend to his regulars.  The pizza still can't be beat, and the Greek salad is great, lots of feta!

I always try to shop local, places like this make it easy!"}
{"text":"Pizza was overall okay, somewhat uninspired. Crust was good - the standout of the order.  The wings were inedible, I ordered 'extra crispy', they arrived soggy and slimy. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Took an hour and 20 to get here and it's gross, grocery freezer style pizza. I'm considering just tossing the whole thing and just ordering from Joes like I should have to begin with"}
{"text":"not impressed. Ive eaten a lot of pizza in my time and DiVitos ranks a level or two above frozen. The sauce was bland, the crust was limp and tasteless and the toppings were less than fresh."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious!
This is a hidden gem of Phoenix.  
The staff was friendly and the pizza was second to none!"}
{"text":"We ordered a take-out of lasagna, salad, meatballs and garlic bread for 25 people. The food was delicious and could have fed at least 15 more!
Best Italian food I've had since I left Boston."}
{"text":"Amin has successfully kept the DiVito family recipes going long after George sold him this place decades ago. Armando has learned these family secrets and together they duplicate the same quality they did back in the 70s. If you are an Italian sausage fan you must try DiVito's sausage on a pizza of your choice or a Mama's Special. The Greek influence is amazing. All stars because the best things in life never change."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for years and finally popped in there this afternoon!  I should've left when a disgruntled customer in front of me was raising all kinds of hell about her food not being hot.  I ordered a gyro and an Italian Sub, and must say they were both pretty horrible, especially the Italian Sub which was loaded with ham and bologna, just cheap crap, the gyro wasn't much better!  The place is absolutely filthy. I'd be curious to try the pizza but realistically, doubtful that will ever happen!  Clean this place up!"}
{"text":"Di Vito's is nothing spectacular, let's get that out of the way first. It's cheap Italian food that's nothing to write home about. If you're looking for an unforgettable experience, look somewhere else. However, this joint has a few really good things going for it that make it worth a regular spot on your lunch rotation if you live or work in the area.

For one, Di Vito's is consistent. You will never get a bad meal here. You will get an average Italian meal, a good sandwich or a decent pizza every time you visit. It's the perfect definition of \"just good enough\"; you know, that kind of food where you know there's something a lot better our there, but because of value/convenience you keep coming back - that's what Di Vito's is. And if you're like me, you want a consistent eating establishment. Di Vito's is not a crap shoot, and that earns it points.

The next thing that Di Vito's has going for it is value. For an Italian take-away spot, you get a pretty hefty bang for your buck at Di Vito's. Whenever I order an anchovy pizza from there, the price I pay is reasonable, and guess what, the pizza actually has a decent amount of anchovies! And their dinners are also a really great value. For $9.75 I got a sizeable portion of eggplant parmesan, spaghetti, garlic bread and a salad. The eggplant parm was average at best, but there's no denying the fact that this is a very good value.

Finally, the service is solid. The food is made in a timely manner, the staff is always polite and friendly and I genuinely feel appreciated every time I visit. On a slow day, the workers will usually stop and chat with you. It feels nice. I always find that Italian restaurants have some of the friendliest workers, and Di Vito's is no exception.

So time for a rating... it's a tough one here. Probably between 3 and 4 stars. Let me make it clear: the food quality is NOT worth 4 stars; it's 3 stars at best. It's the kind of food that you know you can make better at home, but hey, sometimes you just don't feel like cooking, so you settle on eating out. You know that feeling, you want some cheap Italian food at the last minute, that's where Di Vito's comes in.

Regardless, I'm going to be generous and bump Di Vito's up to 4 stars. The restaurant has always treated me well, it has great value for an Italian place and I always know what to expect. Plus, it's literally within walking distance of my residence, so it gets a hometown bonus.

Bottom Line: Di Vito's is some of the most average, run-of-the-mill Italian food you will ever find. But if you're looking for good value and consistent friendly service, it deserves a visit."}
{"text":"I used to live behind here for all of middle school and high school and this is the place to eat! Whether it's by the Alice of a whole pie, it's the best by far. My mom loves their Greek salad and hot subs. My boyfriend loves their wings and baked ziti. Amin is always friendly and remembers return customers by name! Once we came right as they were closing and he came out and said he'd make our pizza anyways, which was a happy surprise and be greatly appreciate the great service. 
Their pizza has a nice crisp crust, the right amount of sauce and cheese. You can taste its homemade and it's done right! Even the leftovers the next day are almost even better. Even cold!

I've since moved further into Scottsdale but still find myself here for pizza. It's like home!"}
{"text":"no... no... and no... the antipasto salad is made with bar-s turkey bologna.. and the wings are from tyson!!!!! out of some strange curiosity... i wonder what the pizza tastes like... wouldn't be surprised if it was red baron pizza."}
{"text":"I have to completely disagree with the original poster about DiVito's.  Yes, the shop is tiny and the restaurant is old fashioned, but they make up for it with a killer pie.  Maybe it is a little bit of childhood nostalgia as this was our pizza shop of choice growing up, but I love this pizza.  The pie is large, and all of the ingredients are quality.  I have been eating a half sausage mushroom, half Canadian bacon and pineapple.  The crust is more of a traditional new york style, but the pizza is not super thin with a big crust either.  It's a great pie and worth every dollar.

I have had other meals from DiVito's and while they are good, I still wouldn't order anything other than the pizza.  The stuffed shells and manacotti are very good."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since High School and I graduated in the early 90's.  Amin, the owner is great and remembers his customers by name.  Di Vito's is so consistent even on Monday night when Amin is not making the pies himself.  Great quick friendly delivery and they have such a great Pizza.  All the deserts are homemade and they have one of the best Greek salads around and very inexpensive.   For a neighborhood pizza that has great delivery I have to give 5 stars."}
{"text":"When it comes to local Italian businesses this is as good as it gets. I always get the meatball calzone here and its fantastic. There is some flavor to it that is unmatched. And the best thing is it is very affordable. You can get a calzone that has gotta be like 2 pounds for less than $7. I have also had their pizza and it is equally unique and very appetizing."}
{"text":"Tonight, I check-in at my hotel, unpacked...I needed dinner. I perused around Yelp looking at various restaurant venues...too many really good restaurants makes it difficult to choose. I reached out to EAT24 from Yelp. After I decided upon the cuisine...it started lightening and thunder, followed by it raining to beat the band. 

No problem...let's have it delivered...!!!

Tonight I went for something that I very rarely ever have...pizza...not just any pizza, but a small, pepperoni and tomato pizza...but I need some veggies so I also elected for the antipasto salad...this is going to be good...oh wait, dessert...how about the cheese cake...!!!

Remember, there's a storm brewing out there...

...dinner arrived on time, complete...and hot. A simple little pepperoni pizza, and my goodness, what a tasty pizza...my taste buds ignited like 4th of July fireworks...perfect. The salad was refreshing...and of course the cheese cake...awesome...

Remember, this is a family owned and operated small business, doing their best to share some great Italian food. Give them some of your support, you will be pleased. :-)"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Di Vito's since I was a little girl and it really hasn't changed much! They've been there for 27 years and it is owned by the same family, making the same good Italian food. 

When ordering pizza, we have way too many local options to choose from rather than just order from a chain, so since Di Vito's is down the road, they're an easy choice to support local! We usually order a small pizza with mushrooms and black olives and it comes to a little under $12. It is perfect for 2 people! Since it is down the street, we always pick it up to avoid delivery costs! 

I really like the cheese and ingredient quality, however, i'm not the biggest fan of their crust. It is a little crispy for me! I usually like my crust chewy. :) Just my personal preference. But the pizza overall is pretty tasty! 

The actual business is not very clean at all, in fact, this is why I had stopped coming here for years. I recommend picking it up and taking out versus eating in. You'll enjoy the ambiance at home better! ;) We'll probably be back again soon when we're craving pizza!"}
{"text":"This pizza is something to be tried to believed. I have included a recipe that I feel would accurately recreate this awesomeness. 1: mix low grade flour, water, minimal salt, and yeast together in a bowl. Let rise for a maximum of 1 hour. 2: Roll out dough on to a pizza pan and let sit for a minimum of 4 hours until the consistency of the dough is similar to cardboard. 3: add the sauce. Ensure it is the opposite of robust, the closer to tomato soup the better. Add just enough to cover the dough but it should still be rather transparent. 4: add the cheese. The cheese should be relatively low grade. We want it to turn extra greasy as it cooks. Now for the finishing touch, add the pepperoni. Nothing fancy here, just something that resembles a circular meet object. Put in the oven at 350 and pull out at your earliest convenience. No need to wait until the cheese browns. As an added bonus I've also included their wing recipe: purchase some frozen  drummetes from your local grocery. Stick them in a bowl of luke warm water to allow them to thaw. Next, provide a conservative layer of generic tabasco sauce  to each wing. Put in a microwave safe container for approximately 2 minutes. The goal is to get them thoroughly cooked but the consistency of a soggy waffle. There you have it. You too are now ready to open a pizzeria of similar quality to this establishment."}
{"text":"Not from Scottsdale. But visiting daughter. I found this place on yelp.. ordered 2 pizzas. Cheese and combo. Both were super yummy!! When I first drive up I was a little nervous.  Kind of a hole in the wall.. update would be recommended but clearly its been in the family a long time (hence the old pics of relative founder?) Don't judge a book by its cover... the Pizza was yummmy! Recommend!"}
{"text":"Really small hole-in-the wall place... which I love these types of places but I got here at 12:35 and they were completely out of the daily special and only 1 person was in the place! I ordered an amazing Calzone though! Good place for a small spot, highly unlikely I will come back. Bathrooms were pretty bad as well!"}
{"text":"Disappointed!  From the Yelp rating and the looks of the place I thought it was a diamond in the rough.  This could be my neighborhood go-to pizza joint, I thought!  There were some questionable comments in the reviews but I thought maybe if I get the carryout, it is better than the slices served there?

The pizza was underwhelming.  Although the toppings were good, sauce and crust was ok, it was very much like a homemade copycat version of Tombstone pizza.  However, at 2.50 vs 18 per pie, might as well stock up on the frozen version.

The chicken wings were pretty soggy and had lots of thick skin on it.  If you like that kind of thing, go for it.  Me, I would rather not.

I wish I could have liked it a little better, they seemed very nice and I like local businesses.  :/"}
{"text":"A friend ordered us delivery from Divito's shortly after we had our baby. First, I was shocked at how inexpensive dinner for two with salads & bread, delivered was ($18) and when we sat down to eat, it was delicious!! I couldn't believe living in the Arcadia area for years I had not heard about this little place, that delivers too. 

My only dislike is the last two times I've wanted to order, they're closed. Sunday is understandable, but a Saturday evening at 7:30? Maybe b/c it's a holiday weekend."}
{"text":"Excellent piping hot pizza!! Jus missing French fries for the wings and the Italian sub. All perfect"}
{"text":"This place is close to the house and is ALWAYS consistent.  To me, that is the most important.  I can take a place with an attitude and great food, i will NOT accept lousy service with poo food.  Me favorite is De Fara's in Brooklyn, hands down best ever.  AZ pizza is struggling, Bianco saves the city.  Di Vito's has some good pasta dishes and the Italian sub is outstanding.  The wife doesnt care for the pizza too much but I think its pretty good compared to some other places in town.  They have some pretty good deserts as well."}
{"text":"Di Vito's is the best pizza out there!!!! The manager is so nice and friendly and there pizza is absolutely the best highly recommended 10/10"}
{"text":"I'm reserving judgement on Di Vito's Pizza for now. Even though I've lived in the neighborhood for the last three years, I overlooked this joint every time I drove by. Let me rephrase that... I never noticed this joint.

Di Vito's Pizza is on the northwest corner of 52nd & Thomas in an old Circle K building. For that reason, this place reminds me of Phoenix House of Pizza and Subs, which isn't too far away. Unfortunately, the atmosphere isn't quite as nice. But how nice can you make an old convenience store?

The menu says that Di Vito's has been around since 1973. I can believe that. The menu is simple and it smells really good when you walk it. Di Vito's offerings are more Mediterranean related, as compared with Phoenix House. Which is why I chose the daily special.

Some co-workers were with me for lunch recently. Two of us tried the Gyro which included a decently sized Greek salad and a large drink for $5.50 (which is a hell of a deal). The odd man out had a salad and some wings. We all agreed that our choices were pretty good, particularly the salads, but not great.

I've enjoyed a lot of gyros lately, and this one wasn't as good. Overall, it was a little dry and featured less meat. But for the money, I'm not gonna complain. Di Vito's offers such a good value for its lunch specials, I'm sure we will be back to sample the menu further and I will re-assess this review."}
{"text":"Good New York style pizza. Had the pepperoni and sausage. Love the crust and its great for a late night eat."}
{"text":"The prototypical neighborhood pizza joint that wins your patronage more on convenience and the fact that you know the owners."}
{"text":"Won't be going back.

I really hate to give a local business a less then favorable review. Especially, if the business appears to receive positive reviews from others. 

Today, my friend and I decided to go to DiVito's Pizza for lunch.  We ordered a slice of pizza, greek salad, and meatball sub. In all honesty, I would have to say that the food at DiVito's Pizza is poorly executed and of low quality.

I have eaten my fair share of meatball subs.  However, I have never been served a meatball sub that didn't have whole or sliced meatballs.  The meatballs on the subs at DiVitos are broken into small pieces, drenched in tomato sauce, and covered with cheese. The pieces of meatball were bland, soft, with a bread filling, unlike homemade meatballs which are larger, solid, and flavorful. 

The pizza was equally unappetizing.  The sauce was greasy, so much so,  that we had to place a napkin on top of the pizza to soak up the grease.  The crust on the pizza was overcooked , and there was just no flavor, and the salad was old and wilted. 

We walked away from DiVito's Pizza eating very little with only one thought, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm was a East High Longhorn and had my 1st DeVito's pizza in 1980. Had many more in the Years that followed, but moved east of Phoenix 3 years later. But when I'm in Phoenix you know I stop for a pie or calzone. When my kids fly into town we always stop on the way home. My 40th Birthday was 15 pies shipped to Queen creek and a great party. Came home today and my best friend stopped for lunch but dropped a pie off to my home. Dinner is complete. Real Pizza and calzones, handmade and cooked in ovens over 40 years old. The difference you will notice every time you stop for a pie or a slice and don't forget an RC cola. Did I say the TV is finally in color, no more black and white. A great little pizza joint just like back in Philly or New York."}
{"text":"I have been going here now for over 2 years for my pizza needs. 

They are local and family run, always appreciate my business. 

Pizza has high quality ingredients. One large pizza has 8 big slices and is fair priced. 

They can deliver and are always friendly when I come in for pickup."}
{"text":"Pizza is very okay.  Underwhelming to say the least for a hole in the wall pizza joint.  Expected better, but that's what I get for going out on a wing I guess."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Great food. Great prices! Owner goes above and beyond. It's nice to have your name remembered and greeted with smiles!"}
{"text":"I love to support local, family owned businesses and am not a big fan of chain restaurants. Di Vito's was definitely a great choice! I ordered the baked ziti and it came with garlic bread and a salad. Very reasonable pricing also! I was eating it and had to jump on to write this review, because it is that good! I definitely recommend this place. I cannot wait to try the pizza on my next visit!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good overall stopped in for the quick slice and drink will try again had the pepperoni pizza"}
{"text":"Don't let the hole in the wall vibe fool you. I live right next to this place so I am a frequent customer. The place looks completely run down but the pizza is pretty darn good. Their home made sausage is awesome and they're pretty quick with your order. Not the best pizza I've ever had but it's quick and delicious."}
{"text":"The short: Fine for a neighborhood drop-in, offering moderately priced pizza, pasta, subs, and a few Sicilian sandwiches (calzones), as well as some Greek options like gyros and baklava, but food isn't terribly exciting--and neither are the décor or staff. 

The long: Located on the northwest corner of 52nd St. and Thomas, this little hole in the wall has been serving pizza, Italian, and Greek food since 1973. The restaurant interior is straightforward and frugal--you walk in and up to the counter that fronts the kitchen, peer into the cold case to the right holding Greek treats like baklava, or head to the little dining room to the left, filled with a handful of nondescript tables and chairs. 

DiVito's is open Monday through Friday, from 10:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., and closed Sunday. 
The offer weekday daily lunch specials for under $5. Pasta dishes for $8, including side salad and garlic bread. Pizza starting at $7.50 for a 12\" cheese. 

House salad was crisp. The wings hit the spot, without covering it. They were flabby skinned--cooked through, but not fried to give it a crust. I wasn't expecting it to be battered or anything, but I like a quick fry to hold the skin to the meat. The wing sauce was good enough--a bit of heat, a bit of tang, and down it went. We ordered Mama's Special: Pepperoni, sausage, green pepper, olives, mushrooms & onions. No love for the pizza crust. It was baked just right, with some nice spotty oven char on the bottom, and the crust looked like it would be great, laced with big air bubbles, but there was no chew. I wasn't expecting a big bubble gum bite, but I like a bit of chew, and with that chew, some of the flavor that tells me the dough was allowed to rest for awhile to develop. This dough yielded instantly with a bite, then quickly disintegrated in my mouth as if it were Wonder Bread. In a backwards way, it was left to be carried by the toppings, but alas, those were subpar--the lightly spread sauce (just right in quantity, bland in quality), mozzarella, sausage, black olives, mushrooms--it was all off the supermarket shelves. The Sicilian meatball sandwich had the same crust, and it was more obvious here, in plain sight, but still a wallflower. Again, more rise time, and a sprinkle of salt in the dough, and maybe we could've been friends. I liked the innards, even though it wasn't the big globes of meatballs sweating into marinara that I was expecting. The meatball meat--just nicely seasoned lean ground beef--was scooped in, filling every inch of the sandwich's cavern (no annoying air bubble cubby holes of emptiness), and sprinkled with mozzarella. Again, not great, but adequate, and everything I wish a Hot Pocket could be, if not the calzone I'd expected. The lasagna I especially wanted to love, especially with its menu tag: \"the best you've ever tasted.\" Here, I loved the composition--not too much noodle, not too much cheese, not too much sauce inside, though the thing was really swimming in sauce when I received it. I easily sopped that up with the very tasty and perfectly crisp garlic bread, though. I liked whatever herbs they seasoned their ricotta with, and that they seasoned the ricotta at all, since it's too often neglected in lasagna dishes. I just felt like the sauce was missing something, and it fell just flat. Maybe a few glugs of wine or some minced garlic would've given it the light bite I was looking for. The desserts were also fine. The cannoli in its fried shell wasn't traditional, filled with a slightly starchy vanilla pastry cream instead of sweetened ricotta, but it was crispy and creamy and sweet. The tiramisu was tasty, but I couldn't taste any Marsala in the zabaglione, so I declared it decidedly kid-friendly. 

One of the best things about DiVito's food is that it kinda tasted better the next day, reheated. *shrugs* Maybe it's one of those things that needs a night to allow the flavors to meld? With decent prices and decent food, especially when a craving hits, I won't mind going back to further test this theory. I wish I could give them 2.25 stars: \"Meh, it's ok.\""}
{"text":"Holy shit!!! I have been looking for NY pizza for YEARS. This place is the real deal. Legit."}
{"text":"Every time we come by, \"Amin how is business?\" 

\"Good, the people never stop eating.\" Admittedly the place is a little divey but they keep it clean, and every time I come here I am reminded of why small business rock; they remember you and become like family.  I used to live in back behind the restaurant so I used to eat here several times a week and coming in today reminded me that I wished I still lived in that tiny apartment as a college student behind a pizza shop. The sauce is awesome."}
{"text":"Oddly, I have lived walking distance from Di Vito's for past 5 years, but had never been. There is just so much competition in the area. Anyway, it has now become my go to meal when I don't feel like dealing with traffic and I genuinely like it. I typically just get a medium pizza and the owner and employees are always pleasant and the pizzas are quick. They have other lunch options and seem to have really good lunch specials. They also sell pizza by the slice. Check it out."}
{"text":"The baked ziti was not good and the hot wings tasted like rubbery mush. I've had things from here before like pizza so I will stick to that next time."}
{"text":"As some others have stated, good lunch specials. The subs are decent enough and very inexpensive. Portion size is also good. Dinner menu is not working though. Food is a little bland and pricy past lunch hours. Pizza is kind of like little ceasers being it has a thick chewy crust and not a lot of toppings. But like I said lunch menu is actually pretty OK considering that most fast food combos are $10 now days, and even with it's flaws Di Vitos is still fresh handmade food for the $5 - $8 area. Hope they improve the pizza however because I want to like this neighborhood place. It has character that corporate food places can never match."}
{"text":"Service is amazing, and hey momma isnt her to whip me up a good italian dish so this is my go to spot.. love it or hate it ...i love it when i get a chance to have it.  i never had any issues here and i am also a fan of the pizza."}
{"text":"Everyone at DiVito's thank you for making a darn good pizza and wings! First time customer here, Ill be coming back for more. You made my mothers day weekend even more special, thank you"}
{"text":"Great place for delivery, haven't been in yet but have had it delivered lots of times. Always fast and friendly as well. The food is great! I always order the lasagne but have tried other dishes when we order in groups for for work. Best lasagne I've had in idk how long. The sauce mixed with the cheese, meat and pasta is the best. It's become my Saturday thing lately. I highly recommend..."}
{"text":"So I came here for lunch based on the reviews and the proximity to my work. There is not a lot of good fast food in the area so I was excited to try it. The reviews on the location are correct, it's in a small hoody strip, but that's usually where the best food is found right? 

I got there around 1130a and was the only person in the joint. I wasnt sure they were actually open because they had no food out in the cases, but I did eventually find a few small pies sitting out. I ordered a couple of slices and waited. When the food finally came, it was really disappointing. I swear it was frozen pizza or something. The crust was rubbery and awful. The sauce had little flavor. I forced my way through the first slice because I knew I wouldn't have time to grab anything else to eat on my short lunch break... But I couldn't bare to even begin the second. I threw the rest away and went back to work. 

One person did come in to pick up a pizza to go while I was there, so perhaps the freshly made pies are much better... But I won't be going back to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Pizza was just \"ok\". Delivery was late. Wings were seriously the worst that I've ever ordered. In my entire life. Pizza Hut is a huge upgrade over this...."}
{"text":"This place was disgusting... I am a die hard pizza lover. But this place, their pizza and wings were beyond sloppy. When it come to their wings, there was more skin on them than meat, they were supposed to be \"MEDIUM\" hot, not even close, plus NO flavor.
The pizza was cold and the dough tasted like card board. I'm usually skeptical about trying new places, and this time sadly, I proved myself right about new paces. Oh, they forgot my crushed pepper and napkins too.."}
{"text":"I ordered the large cheese pizza, Greek Salad lg & dozen wings. The pizza was delish the salad was huge filled with lots of fresh veggies & feta.  Their house dressing is tangy & is a perfect match!! Great salad & plenty of it. The wings were not for me the meat was tender & fell off bones but not crispy i am a bit of a wing snob. The flavor was mild. I ordered by phone & they were courteous, the order was correct...& delivered within 35min just as they had said. Great prices, $26 for all plus tip We will definitely order again"}
{"text":"Awesome sauce. 30 minute delivery. Favorite pizza and lasagna."}
{"text":"I love DiVito's!  Speedy delivery, consist ant, delicious Italian!  The baked ziti is my favorite and it comes with a nice salad that is not just iceberg lettuce and tomatoes.  Amin is a great proprietor that always addresses me by name.  I have carry out almost once a week from them.  This is my neighborhood comfort food!"}
{"text":"I ordered through the yelp app for delivery.  They made some kind of error and did not deliver for hour and a half
The chicken Parmesan is what I order. Ended up with Tyson like pressed chicken circles. Mediocre but was still edible. Would if gave three stars but they did not offer anything for their error in my delivery."}
{"text":"Long time fan of DiVito's! Their lasagna is superb with some kind of secret sauce that makes me crave it fortnightly.  The cheese to meat to sauce ratio is perfection. 

The prices are so reasonable for the quality of food and the amazing service.  
The staff is so kind and lovely - I'll be a lifelong fan."}
{"text":"Worst pizza EVER, LITTLE CAESARS is better this, seriously, it's like a preformed crust mold with toppings put on, Totino's is much better!! Save your money"}
{"text":"So disappointed this weekend when our pizza took 1 1/2 hours to be delivered, after being told to expect it in 35 minutes. I started calling every 20 minutes and was told repeatedly that it was on the way... Obviously not true... Pizza finally arrived cold and garlic bread was hard as a rock.  I called to ask what could be done and was told \"sorry\" and hung up. Will NEVER order from them again."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza.  A weekly staple at our house.  Try the veggie pizza, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Requested thin crust, delivery, so good!! Not healthy, but absolutely great flavor. Delivered on time. Good price and local. We got the Supreme type pizza for the guys: sausage, pepperoni, green peppers, onions etc... Then the pepperoni cheese for the girls. All were amazing. :)"}
{"text":"Large delicious meatball calzones and very good NY pizza. The atmosphere is your basic 1960's convenience store turned pizza joint. But I didn't come for the view. 

Great prices for what you get.  I only get pizza or calzones so I can't speak for other menu items."}
{"text":"Super close to home and super yummy! I love the fact that you can order and pay online! That's a great feature they have!!! They're friendly. The food is filling. They have vegetarian options! (; they're not expensive. Within walking distance. I mean really, what more can I possibly ask for!!!??? So yah this place is getting 5 stars for sure! I don't have any complaints!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza from this restaurant last week, and it was...meh. I don't exactly know what was wrong with it, but I didn't like it."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches around Phoenix, but they changed the bread and I'm not a fan.  Still a good sandwich, I'm hoping they switch back.  Tiny place, run down, but popular.  The staff has worked there forever and they have good prices."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza.  Got take out tonight was absolutely delicious.  With most pizzas I eat there are a few qualities I look for bread toppings cheese etc.  today it was a little plain pie.  Zest sauce, awesome cheese, and bread similar to my fav spot in ny."}
{"text":"I forgot my wallet when picking up my food. They allowed me to take my food and come back the next day to pay. I do go here for take-out regularly, so they know me. Restores my faith in people and small independent businesses. Nice honest people making a difference and good food!"}
{"text":"Wanted a couple of slices of pizza for lunch . . . so I thought i would give this little place a try.  Could have definately been better.

Tried to order a couple of slices of Mama's Special . . . nope . . . didn't have any.  Okay . . . let try something simple, Pepperoni . . . be ready in 10 minutes . . . are you kidding me.  How about Cheese . . . out.  Okay . . . what do you have that is ready . . . an Italian Sausage Calzone . . . I will take it.

And Actually . . . it was pretty good . . . and to be honest . . . if I had originally gone here for a calzone . . . it may even got another star.  Nothing special here . . . but it is worth a try.

I will probably be back, and hopefully they will have some pizza to taste . . . otherwise . . . I will probably only stop when i want my lunch to be a surprise."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites I used to frequent two times a week but since I have cut down on dining out for lunch has slowed. This was the first place I ate at  that made a salad good enough to order over anything else. The service is fast and is more of a pickup than dine in but I have done both and it is ok. Here is a list of food I have tried and what I rate them at:

italian sub w/ feta added 5/5--favorite of mine
meatball/sausage calzone w/ feta added 5/5
greek salad 5/5
antipasto salad 4/5
wings 5/5
gyros 2/5(im not a fan of gyros though)
pizza 3/5( im not a fan of pizza much either but what they do have is good)
manicotti 2/5 (too saucy for me)"}
{"text":"The pizza is like a better little Caesars. Nothing special. I just went here because Mama Mia's was closed due to plumbing issues."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good. I wasn't a fan of the crust, would be nicer light and fluffy reminded me of going to the roller skate rink back in the day. Wings were bomb and let's just say I'm going back for seconds right now! Love how I can order through Yelp! Fast delivery and exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Very under par with the food.  The pizza almost tastes like a frozen pizza they warmed up and delivered for us.  We also ordered wings and they were stuck to the foil package so when we took them out we lost a big chunk of meat and breaking.  I would not order from here again, I've had better at Peter Piper!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years! I love supporting local businesses. I get the veggie pizza every time and it still tastes the exact same as it did 15 years ago. Owners are very friendly and the prices can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is the BEST! I honestly crave it sometimes and have to have it! The owner is so kind, as well. He is always so friendly! Eat here! It's a gem!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to prove another yelper wrong but she was right when she said frozen store bought pizza was better. As soon as I took a bite of their pizza the words Red Baron came to mind. The sauce was nothing special, the cheese was the only redeeming quality along with the meaty mildly spicy wings. Now the crust... That was NOT pizza crust, it felt like thick bread somebody slapped tomato sauce and cheese on it. I usually don't have to judge pizzas this negatively on their crust, but I had to, it's comparable to little Caesar's $5 pizza."}
