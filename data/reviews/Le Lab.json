Ambiance festive et joyeuse le week-end. 
Compter entre 10 et 12$ le cocktails.
Belle carte de whisky aussi.
Happy hour de 17 à 20h30
Un endroit refuge que j'apprécie particulièrement!"}
{"text":"What an interesting bar.  Let me begin by saying that we very much enjoyed our visit. The bar is a little all over the place, which makes this review a little hard to write.

Think of Le Lab as a cutting edge cocktail bar, mixed with flair bartending, mixed with a dance club.  They obviously take cocktails very seriously, and the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable, not stuffy like some cocktail bars can be.  The service is very good and the staff are friendly and attentive.  That being said, something about the combination of the flair tricks, the DJ, the atmosphere as the night wore on, and how extremely young everyone was (patrons and bartenders), something was just a little bit off for us.

When we walked in, our bartender was in the process of making a variation of a Blue Blazer.  I was pretty impressed as I've only seen this drink made once and most bars will refuse to do it.  Here at Le Lab, it is actually on the menu!  The drinks are very very good, and though I enjoyed them immensely, nothing really blew me away.  They do have a large and interesting cocktail menu with two special rotating menus, one focused on a particular spirit, and one on an ingredient.  Those menus when we visited were Canadian Club Maple and Sriracha Hot Sauce.  All the drinks were very inventive.

The service was very good, and attentive.  We were offered some tastes of unfamiliar ingredients and their house made vermouth which was very cool.  While I found the flair bartending aspect of Le Lab interesting and unique at first, it got somewhat tedious by the end of our visit.  I was never sure what to say when they did a trick and then looked right at you, and I almost felt obligated to keep affirming the fact that they just threw a shaker around a bit.  While we always appreciate chatting with our bartenders, we felt that at a few times at Le Lab we could have used a bit more space.  I think this is probably because most of the bar staff seemed very young.  I love the engagement and excitement, but there also needs to be a balance of giving the patrons some privacy at times.

As it got a bit later, the place got packed.  Standing is allowed in the bar area which makes it very crowded, but the bartenders handled it well.  Le Lab actually had enough bartenders working (at least 4 full stations set up) to handle the crowd.  Why is this so rare at cocktail bars?  Because of this, we didn't really feel the crowdedness at the bar unless we got up for some reason.  However, the atmosphere after a certain point was not really what we look for in a bar.  There was nothing wrong with it, it just got very young and somewhat clubby.  A DJ that started up at some point, and it was very much a party atmosphere.  When things like rounds of flaming shots started to happen, it was time for us to go.

Overall, Le Lab was a positive experience and I would definitely recommend it.  Really, there was nothing that I would point out as a negative experience, just a few things that are not really our style in a bar.  In addition to this, they had a lot of really great positives happening, and they did a lot of things well that for some reason many bars seem to do poorly.  If you are really into the party atmosphere, I think you would absolutely love this bar late night.  The bartenders for sure know how to get a party started.  As for us, we would definitely go back, but we would go early, around when they open, and probably try to head out before the crowd hits."}
{"text":"Something for everyone.. 
You know as soon as you walk into this place, they are definitely serving whatever it is you want.. Fully stocked bar, would be an understatement. Just be sure to let them know your flavor and then sit back relax and see it come to life. The creativity is crazy.. i must be honest, i haven't had a drink make me feel like that in awhile. it really takes you by surprise, gets all your taste buds going. :) . that's my kinda stop. 
The decor and ambiance really helps you settle in just nicely.. All around great place.. will definitely be tracking in there again,.."}
{"text":"When you're on vacation for just four days, you generally don't end up going to the same bar twice (especially when that bar is a $7 Uber ride from your hotel). That's not the case when it comes to Le Lab--this was the perfect spot for a night of cocktails that we were happy to visit twice during our short trip!

Our first time in was on a Sunday around 9 pm, and my friend and I were the only two people in the bar. The manager was friendly and gave us excellent drink suggestions, and every single one of the drinks was on point. I don't remember the names, but I had a peach cocktail that tasted extremely fresh, and my friend had a scotch-based cocktail that was hands down one of the beautiful drinks I have ever seen. We came back on our last night and were served by Tony, who has officially made my list of top 5 bartenders ever. We started the night off with a couple of drinks off the menu. I had the High Desert Princess, which was delicious. After drink #1, Tony told us he was done with menus and proceeded to make us unique drinks that were among some of the best I've ever had (high praise--I think I've been to dozens of cocktail bars in NYC, Paris, London, and Atlanta). Not only were they tasty, they were also visually stunning, adorned with all kinds of crazy things like port floats (yum) and pretty flowers. Highly recommend this spot to anyone in Montreal, even for just a day. Prices are pretty reasonable too...3 cocktails came to about $40 (including tip), much less than I've played elsewhere!"}
{"text":"The best cocktail bar that I have ever been to hands down. 
Sat down and received a menu for cocktails. Nothing on the menu was really recognizable as a classic cocktail. I usually get an Old Fasioned. The waitress recommended a cocktail that was comparable. It was fantastic. 
The drinks are all made with care and they take some time to come out but they are worth it. When the bartenders make a drink its really a performance. They light things on fire, flip bottles, and incorporate smoke. If you go to Montreal make sure you stop here."}
{"text":"Absolutely love.  

Very casual and relaxed vibe, with a sensational cocktail menu.  The waitress that helped us was very friendly, and the bartenders were very knowledgeable and accommodating to creative substitutes.  The bar seemed to be located in a quieter area though, which made it a tiny bit uncomfortable to get to from our hotel on Sherbrooke on a very cold winter day.

The Tic & Tac Sour changed my life, and all of their other drinks were just as wonderful.  It was one of my favorite stops in Montreal...I just wish it wasn't so far away from me (as in, another country)!"}
{"text":"Si vous souhaitez passer un bon moment avec votre blonde ou vos amis,c'est la place,allez y en semaine car les week end sont très achalandés! Les cocktails sont fait avec amour par des mixologues talentueux!et que dire de ceux ci!delicieux!"}
{"text":"When it comes to fixing a well balanced and tasty drink it is a true talent. I'm sure lots of people walk into Le Lab and discover the menu as a short novel of options to choose from and with that, how do you choose? And what are some of these ingredients!? The menu was nice in the way that it had it's own little storyline for each drink and also helped it showed how it was made (on the rocks, up, in a Chinese take out box-yes literally a take out box!) what was even more amazing... Jessy, our bartender. She was super helpful, sweet and had the kind of all over the place (in a good way) kind of personality that I love. She let my boyfriend and I taste and smell different ingredients and drinks and just made their pricier cocktails worth every penny.  She was also able to take what I liked and with a couple more questions pin down a drink and make it for me for my tasting. Bravo Jessy! True mixologist! Definitely be back when we visit Montreal again!"}
{"text":"Awesome drinks!  Tony is a cocktail artist!  A true mixologist!!   C'est Bon, C'est Bon!"}
{"text":"Sit back and enjoy your experience watching the mixologists whip up unique tasting cocktails or the fire juggling acts every hour. Drinks are an art-form here - order one of the uniquely crafted drinks on the menu or ask the mixologists to make you something based on your taste/mood!

Good for: small group of friends or a fun/casual date 
Drinks: creative, delicious and strong
We tried the Jerky Lab Jack, and the Mai Tai
Price: $13-15
Tip: make a reservation - it's a small space and can get pretty busy"}
{"text":"Hmm interesting crowd. Extremely loud which is not a bad thing but it's definitely not like the other speakeasies I've been to I to city. No wine list. Only one red and white available. A few beers on tap québécois but it would be nice to see more craft beers. The cocktail list is impressive.  Will have to see how the drinks are before I make a final decision! As other people have pointed out, very French when it comes to the barkeep and staff.



Adding a bit more. Bartenders do a juggling act. Pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Best bartenders and staff, and they really know their drinks! They always have spot-on recommendations if you're feeling indecisive and are super friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Very good drink menu with many many options for many different types of tastes. Looks completely closed when you walk by it but you walk into a very cozy bar/lounge with good music to vibe to. I would recommend the beef jerky jack Daniels drunk it's delicious and the jerky is made in house. 4 stars"}
{"text":"Imagine a craft cocktail bar with the laid back ambiance of a local watering hole. I was so delighted with this bar that I went twice in one day.  I think it was the \"no-frills-come-as-you-are\" attitude that made me fall in love with this place. The spectacular cocktails also helped! If you are ever in Montreal, please make Le Lab a priority!  I wish Boston had a place like this. We do have a lot of speak-easy, craft cocktail places, but nothing as laid back as Le Lab."}
{"text":"Décoration sympa style trendy, dj samedi soir, bar avec un nombre décoiffant de bouteilles.
A tester , staff conseille tres bien, la carte se veut trop philosophique et du coup on ne voit pas les cocktails proposés.
Le son est beaucoup trop fort on ne s entend pas parler il faut hurler 
Pas assez de barman temps d attente pour avoir un verre au moins 25 min pour une table de 2, 45 pour table de 6, dommage"}
{"text":"Super bonne place pour déguster des cocktails entre amis, y'a vraiment beaucoup de choix d'alcool et pas commun.

L'endroit idéal pour des soirées de gens de labo!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service, waitress was more interested in her phone. Even when she was right in front of me, I had to wave at her to get her attention. Took 20 mins to pay the damn bill, almost considered walking out without paying. I counted her coming to the bar and refilling people's water glasses 4 times before I could pay the tab. Only reason this isn't a 1 star rating is that there were some interesting cocktails, the bar-woman was great at her job, but the rest of the staff was amateur. Not going back, especially with the litany of great bars in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great old school cocktail bar. Love the decor, everything just goes with the feeling of the bar down to its menu design. Bartender was friendly and helpful in choosing a drink, a delicious whiskey sour."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous time here with my girlfriends. Just a relaxing but yet fun as hell atmosphere.  The 12 page menu is no joke. There are tons of cocktails to try and there's something for everyone.  Watching the bartenders mix the drinks was a show in itself.  Everything they make is top notch and delicious. They are also friendly and are awesome at concocting something off the menu. The bartenders also performed a juggling act with bottles of fire and they also spitted fire out of their mouths. It's was not overly cheesy either. Highly recommended if you're in Montreal for a girl's night out. Drinks to try: Vanilla and Raspberry Collins, Harry Goose, West Indies Colada and Haute Societe."}
{"text":"Came here for Happy Hour. The place is beautiful. I really like how the whole place is set up, from the bar to the tables.  Cocktails were very tasty. Between my girlfriend and I, we tried most drinks on the happy hour menu. They had a band setting up and we were able to hear a sample and they sounded great. We were planning on coming back later that night after dinner, unfortunately wasn't able to. Bartender and entire staff were friendly. Def check this place out!!"}
{"text":"J'avais lu sur le Lab sur Yelp, et ça m'intéressait vraiment de le découvrir! L'occasion ne s'était tout simplement pas présentée, jusqu'à un certain samedi soir, alors que je n'avais pas une grande envie de sortir. Lorsque ma gang a dit où ils voulaient aller, j'ai retrouvé ma motivation. Je n'aurais pas voulu manquer cela!

Arrivés sur la rue Rachel, nous avons eu peur que ce soit fermé, car de l'extérieur, c'est très discret... Mais, étant un samedi, nous avons quand même tenté notre chance, et c'était bel et bien ouvert. Ouf! Ce n'était vraiment pas trop plein, et avec l'ambiance feutrée, la musique de fond et le bar avec une sélection sans fin, nous nous sommes toute de suite sentis à l'aise. Ce confort est aussi grâce à notre merveilleux serveur, Eddy, qui nous a bien expliqué le concept du Lab et son offre (plus de 800 cocktails). Il a su faire d'excellentes recommandations aux indécis. Les cocktails sont faits de manière extrêmement professionnelle, et c'est un plaisir de regarder les barmans travailler. Nous avons été surtout impressionnés par martinis refroidis à l'azote liquide... WOW!

Personnellement, j'ai coûté et adoré le Pisco Sour et le Jay's Basilic. Le Japanese Gimlet a aussi été bien accueilli par notre groupe.

On peut dire que le Lab est un bar pour découvrir, et pas nécessairement pour fêter, dépendamment de votre budget, car un cocktail de qualité a le prix qui vient avec!!!"}
{"text":"cute little cocktail lounge, spaces are rather limited so don't go there more than 4 or 5 people. You can get some pretty cool drinks made by the bartender where they will do crazy tricks but expect to pay up to 50$ for one of those. The cocktails and drinks are a bit pricey at about 10-20$ depending on what you get, but the ingredients they use are pretty unique and I doubt you could find their selection of drinks anywhere else in the city. They serve food but only little snacks that wont be enough to fill you up."}
{"text":"Speakeasy vibe to it. The bartenders are pure genius with the cocktails they have created. The show that goes into making each one is so unique. You get more than just a drink when you order with them. This place would make a killing in New York City. Was not crowded when we went on a Saturday night but that's what made it even better like we stumbled onto a little secret. Def make it a stop!"}
{"text":"I had a very good time here. Great drinks and great bartenders. Not too fancy but just right for an evening coctail. The flaming marshmallow drink made my night. I tried about four drinks and luckily I could still walk the line."}
{"text":"Atmosphere

What to say about Le Lab besides that it is probably the best Montreal bar I have been in a while. I went there for the first time for my birthday a couple of days ago and I had a blast. It is just a small cozy bar with great music and great atmosphere. At one point during the night, the bartenders started putting on a show with fire which was very impressive and entertaining. You could see everyone from each table getting up to go take pictures of those two bartenders juggling with balls of fire. To top it off, the song they chose to go along with their show was thunderstruck from AC/DC. Simply awesome! If you are not too many, I would even suggest going to the bar, considering the bartenders would do tricks in front of you and entertain you constantly throughout the night. The Lab gets 5 stars for its atmosphere and entertainment.  

Drinks & Food

The drinks the Lab has are very varied, going from exceptionally original drinks to an entire page for non-alcoholic ones. It has a beverage for every type of person.  I was actually surprised to see they made Pisco Sour, which is a drink I discovered in Peru and could not find anywhere else, and even though it did not taste the same, it was still pretty good. Another shocker for me that evening was a strange looking device they used to pour drops of water on a cube of sugar for absinthe. I have to say that, from all the drinks I have tried that night (and, trust me, I have tried many) the one that caught my heart was the Jay's Basilic. If you love raspberries, it'll be your favorite as well. However, if you are looking for a show you need to order the Rouleau Parisien which is a shot they put on fire in front of you. At this point, I forget which type of alcohol it was, but I remember it was really good. The prices of the drinks are pricy but worth trying at least once (the drinks are also incredibly strong). Therefore, for drinks, I give le Lab 5 stars. 

Service

The service at le Lab is extremely slow and our waiter was not very pleasant at all however they do warn you in their menu that the service will take a while considering the complexity of their drinks. I was not very satisfied with their service but the show and the entertainment that the bartenders provided made up for it partly. Also being with a good crowd makes having bad service more bearable. I will give the service of this Montreal bar 2 stars. 

Location

The location of le Lab is not really accessible without a car but being close to la Banquise on Rachel Street makes it totally worth taking a cab for. For those who know me, they know I love ending there after a good night, which I totally recommend against hangovers. The location gets 3 stars.

The total amount of stars I would allocate to le Lab in general would be 5"}
{"text":"The beautiful thing about this place is they have a full bar with alcohol brands you have never heard of - plenty to discover if you like experiencing new taste. Best time to do that wpuld be on weekdays, because it can get real crowded on the weekends.
It's a shame that the lovely bartenders were somewhat rude and reaalllly with the service. You'd expect better from a small place."}
{"text":"My wife and I definitely enjoyed Le Lab, although being used to the Chicago mixology scene we weren't really expecting the banging house music or fusillade of flaming shots coming to all the tables around us. Those things weren't negatives though, it was actually a really fun atmosphere!

The most important part of a cocktail bar is the drinks, and Le Lab has those down perfectly. We made our way through four cocktails that were conceptually interesting and VERY tasty - my favorite was an absinthe drink that tasted like a mild Orange Dreamsicle.

The only thing that was a slight negative was that the waitstaff was stretched a bit thin. To their credit, they were flying around the bar, but with another server or two around we would've ordered a few more drinks and stumbled home instead of walking. :)"}
{"text":"Choice bar with respect to drinks, service (so patient with explanations; let us in early), ambiance, and location. Just go."}
{"text":"Je m'ennuie tant de ce bar qui était juste à côté de mon ancien appartement! 

Leurs cocktails étaient créatifs et il y avait assez régulièrement de la nouveauté pour que même les habitués aient toujours quelque chose à découvrir. 
J'ai même déjà bu un cocktail flambé dans lequel on devait faire griller une guimauve! 

Pourquoi seulement trois étoiles alors? Le service médiocre de l'endroit! Lorsqu'on s'assoit à une table, quelqu'un vient nous voir et prendre notre commande... mais il y a toujours trop peu de staff sur le plancher pour la masse de clients. C'est toujours plutôt long se faire servir là-bas... mais la dernière fois que j'y suis allée, ça a pris (sans exagération) 1h20 avant que quelqu'un vienne nous voir! 

Si vous voulez un conseil, allez-y quand même pour les cocktails, mais allez-y un soir de semaine plutôt tranquille pour prendre un verre, mais évitez les vendredis et samedis si vous voulez boire plus qu'un drink dans votre soirée."}
{"text":"Great cozy bar, very entertaining flame/bottle show by bartender!"}
{"text":"Having always wanted to go to the Le Lab mile end location but woefully far for me, Le Lab downtown is the best news ever! The drink menu here is EXTENSIVE. They even have seasonal drinks written on the board above the bar. The staff is super friendly. We were able to get a spacious booth in the middle of a Friday night which was great. I love the vibe in this bar. It was the perfect place to chat over fun drinks. Our server came and checked on us a few times in the night and was super friendly. A great bar in Montreal. Would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Drinks done right. Reminded me of San Francisco. Menu was daunting, but the bartenders accommodated by asking questions and were enthused to try to impress.. 
Tony was great. Music was really good, from Spanish, to oldies, to house.."}
{"text":"Mixologists who are passionate about perfection in their creations. Great cocktails created with fire and flair. The Jack Lab cocktail was superb. I say this despite having been to many cocktail establishments in New York City."}
{"text":"Super cool bar! Menu changes every 6
Months and EVERY cocktail is tasty. We went on a Sunday night and had no trouble getting in but I hear you need a reservation on Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and service, but I couldn't appreciate the drinks that much...I guess I had really high expectations"}
{"text":"To start off, the drink menu was overly complicated, with many highly-specific ingredients. That being said, I have to cocktail bars before, in both New York and Toronto. Despite the world-renowned reputation of those cities, I found the cocktail bars there to be less pretentious and of better quality. When I asked for assistance navigating the menu from the waiter, he offered me none, but instead provided me with a dismissive and brusque attitude. The drink that my husband ordered was delicious, but over-priced. For $14, I would expect polite service at the very minimum. Very disappointing- I would not return."}
{"text":"Nous avons passé quelques heures à cet endroit.  C'est un petit bar intéressant.  L'ambiance était pas mal ce soir là, mais, on était tôt.  C'est un peu cher et surfait."}
{"text":"Tres belle place et cosie pour une drink en fin de journee surtout par temps froid. La demoiselle qui nous a servie etait tres sympathique et souriante. La tataki de Bison super bon et leur hummus egalement. Maintenant reste a essayer l'absinthe!!"}
{"text":"J'adore cet endroit très intime et différent de ce qu'on peut connaitre sur le plateau. Le menu cocktail est vaste et original. Le décor et l'ambiance feutrée, \"d'une autre époque\", me colle à la peau et surtout rien n'est clinquant ! Je n'ai pas essayé les soirées très occupée et déjà le service est assez lent...j'imagine que c'est mieux de profiter de ce bar à cocktails en semaine !"}
{"text":"After much research, I felt like this was THE bar at the forefront of mixology in Montreal. They had the most promising menu and reviews, and despite a mishap with a lost cab + the bitter cold, we made our trek here. And we weren't disappointed.

Past the velvet curtains, you find yourself in a dim-lit, dark-paneled room with suddenly chatty French-Canadians, mostly late 20s to 30-somethings (+ older), thanks to liquid courage. Small talk might not be their strong suit, but tame dancing definitely is (no twerking here) avec le DJ de la nuit.

Their menu is a tad overwhelming, but you can't go wrong with most of them. They have everything from creamier drinks e.g. Lemon in the Sky, classics e.g. martinis, shareable punch bowls, and even mocktails. However, if you want a show, you want one of their flaming shots/drinks in the back pages. We quickly bonded with Eddy, one of three bartenders working that night (and my high school writing teacher doppelganger), and he introduced us to the ABC - absinthe, bacardi, chartreuse - which involved two glasses, maniacal (just kidding) shaking, and some fire, of course.

It seems that I'll be back in town sooner than I anticipated, so I will definitely be ordering the jerky lab jack and apple crumble shot this time!

Notes:
- They have happy hour! select drinks for $8 before 8PM (normally $14)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty potent drinks that are absolutely tasty and I love how they have bored games on a shelf for their patrons to  play with their friends whilst sippin on some interesting and well concocted coqtails!"}
{"text":"This place is great really good tasting drinks!!! Staff is really knowledgeable on pretty much any drink you could pull out of a hat!!"}
{"text":"Slow and rude service. Mediocre drinks. Outdated venue. Too many other great places around. Don't waste your time coming here."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend for her birthday, we had a blast. I will go back every time I am in Montreal for a long weekend."}
{"text":"Cocktails only okay and lab-tender had quite the attitude. Ambience a little too dark for our taste. Great French waiter, which took this from 2 to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Cet endroit a tout pour charmer les amateurs de cocktails originaux. Belle ambiance, décor sombre et serveur(se)s habillé(e)s de manière très chic et glamour à nous faire croire un décordes années 50.C'est un petit espace donc il se peut qu'on se trouve entre deux tables très serrés à entendre de près la conversation des autres clients, mais les délicieux mélanges d'alcools proposés sur le menu et la musique électro-swing vous feront passer tout de même un très bon moment."}
{"text":"THE BEST COCKTAILS EVER!!!

My friends, I do not kid you when I say this... I love cocktails and have tried many places and this place wins hands down! If there is any place from my recent visit to Montreal that will make me come back for more, it's this place!

Le Lab has the retro-cool vibe as soon as you enter. You can see a vintage cash register and some other cool stuff lying around. The place was super crowded but I think we got lucky and found a table pretty quickly. The place is very dimly lit and we did have to use our phones to read the menu. My favourite drink was 'lemon in the sky', it said in the description that it was like a dessert drink and yum it was. It wasn't super sweet but it came with vanilla cream on top and the cream was so creamy, it was the creamiest cream I've ever had, that's how creamy it was! Just writing this review is making my mouth water for the drink. There was not a single drink that any of us ordered which was below par, each drink was fantastic! Next on my list was a flaming shot that came with marshmallow. This again was superb! My final drink for the evening was another shot called 'Kiss me baby' and boy did I want to be kissed again!

All of us had 3 drinks each and everyone loved their drinks. We may have sipped each others first drink but after that everyone was pretty protective of their drinks. 
The DJ here was fantastic and the performance by the bartenders was so much fun! 

Hats off to the bartenders for creating one amazing drink after the other and to all cocktail lovers out there, you need to come here ASAP!!!

PS: This place may turn you into an alcoholic."}
{"text":"Visiting this place is an experience in itself. If you are a tourist looking to visit something unique, a connoisseur, or someone looking for something different than crawling into your favourite watering hole and get hammered..this place is for everyone.
The drinks are a little expensive..I agree but you're paying for the craftiness and the show. This is not the kind of bar you go to every week but a kind of place where you take your date or outstation friends visiting you to show them something different. 
The bartenders showcasing their impressive mixology, juggling and pyrotechnic skills..all for you chief. 
Sit back, sip your cocktails slow and take in the experience. You know you're in for a great experience."}
{"text":"love love love this place. 

dark, swanky, sexy, innovative, good service. Reasonable prices, with fancy-creative drinks. theres even a special, get a pint of beer and get a shot with it for $2. i love me some deals.

The place is small. but theres areas to stand at, and as soon as a place opens up--your waitor will push you right into that spot and shit you down. everyone was pleased with their drinks, some which even come with an interactive experience. bacardi 151 and absinthe mixed to gether and lit on fire with some fancy twist of the wrists with more than one glass.

i also like the way the waitors dress here & the menus are so creative!"}
{"text":"J'adore les cocktails, donc le Lab faisait partie de ma wishlist. J'ai essayé la place 2 fois, une fois entre amoureux, c'était ok, mais un peu trop tranquille et manque d'ambiance. Puis j'ai essayé en groupe pour la semaine du cocktail et on s'est plus amusés, la place était pleine à craquer, le staff semblait complètement débordé. Donc 2 expériences assez opposées. Je le conseillerais plus en groupe. La carte est définitivement intéressante, on retrouve des ingrédients vraiment originaux dans nos cocktails. Le staff est là pour vous conseiller afin de vous orienter correctement. Les prix sont dans la moyenne, on ne va clairement pas là pour se saouler, mais pour déguster."}
{"text":"Outside of Vegas Nevada, I have not seen a lot of flare bartending. It was really fun to watch. I don't know if it was worth seeing that reflected in the price of my drink ($12 to $14 per drink!), but it was a cool experience. Services was awesome and the drinks we did get were delicious. If you are a meat eater do make sure to try their Jerky Jack Cocktail (with real Jerky and flambe caramelized sugar)."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing ......

before the girl in the all black with the black hair in a ponytail who worked there was extremely wasted making a spectacle of herself and made my husband and I extremely uncomfortable. Her friend with a bookbag and head phones stumbled to our table who was also extremely wasted and came off very aggressive and scary. You think the bartenders would kick these people out to make their PAYING customers feel SAFE! Apparently not."}
{"text":"Flaming bar tricks??? Yes, Please!!!

Yup, if you are lucky like us, you can come here on a Friday night and catch a glimpse of the glory that are flaming flair or bar tricks! The music totally changes and all three bar tenders stop making drinks and start tossing flaming bottles of alcohol around in the air!! All in unison too! It was pretty amazing to see, and definitely was the highlight of our night.

In addition to their fire skills, these are some of the best bartenders I've seen. Granted you will pay for those bar tending skills in the prices for these drinks which won't run you any cheaper than $11 each, but man are they creative and fancy! And they even have a whole list of crazy absinthe cocktails too! 

Whatever you do, don't ask for a drink blindly....Our friend Lindsey asked for something on fire and then a few minutes later she found herself being cheered on by the whole bar and the bartender handed her a straw to chug her flaming coffee drink which they had to switch out half way through because the fire melted it!! Lots of guys came and congratulated her saying she was one of the few women they had seen drink that drink! So hip hip hooray for her!"}
{"text":"Went here while on vacation to Montreal.  Staff was friendly and engaging, cocktails were good, but the real star of the show was their absinthe program. Filtered, ice cold water slowly dropped out of a fountain over a cube, producing a fantastic louche. Will go again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had the best time at Le Lab with a French bartender named Nicholas. He went above and beyond to talk to us and provide us with restaurant and bar recommendations for our next few cities we were visiting. 

Beyond the amazing service from Nicholas, who seemed to really enjoy his job and our company, the drinks were fantastic. I had the Bi Bim Boom, with pink peppers, while my boyfriend had an interesting drink lit on fire with beef jerky in it. 

A really cool speak-easy atmosphere, featuring unique drinks, and fabulous service. A must visit! Thanks Nicholas!"}
{"text":"Really fun bar, and fantastic show if you are able to watch the bartenders- I highly recommend sitting at the bar. It takes a bit of time for them to make make their drinks, so if you are at the bar you are able to enjoy the show instead of sitting and waiting. The service was prompt and friendly and the staff was helpful as well if you wanted an interesting drink but nothing on the menu piqued your interest.  They make a few drinks with really charming presentation so it is always fun for someone in your group to unexpectedly wind up with a really wacky drink. However, I can't say I would love this bar if I was with a group larger than 4 at a table. It would probably take a while to get drinks and have a bland atmosphere, yet the payoff is pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Belle place pour goûter à des créations cocktails originales. Mon ami trouvait son cocktail trop fort et le barman a insisté pour le refaire. Si je ne me trompe pas, chaque cocktail contient au moins 2 oz d'alcool. J'ai pris un cocktail thalandais et la présentation était très originale dans une boîte de carton pour emporter des restos asiatiques. 

C'est un peu cher, environ 14$ par cocktail."}
{"text":"Had a very good time here. Good drinks and great bartenders. Not too fancy but just right for an evening of drinks. The flaming marshmallow drink made my night. I tried about four drinks all of which were great and strong. Luckily you can order mini drinks as well."}
{"text":"Great chill spot, it's a gorgeous room - the service is great and the cocktails are exactly right.  We all had classic cocktails so I can't speak to any creativity.  But I was being difficult in choosing and the waitress expertly guided me to a sazerac which they made absolutely perfectly.  Wish I had a spot like this at home."}
{"text":"Best cocktails in the city. Specialist. What a show. Batisse (?) is a real craftsman."}
{"text":"Outstanding. I've been to a few similar places in the Washington, D.C. area and this is great.  Terrific ambiance, excellent and creative drinks.  I loved the music as well.   Highly recommended.  I particularly liked the King Storm - very fresh and gingerey."}
{"text":"I stopped by with some Yelp friends on a Saturday night at about 1:30 am. It was busy but we were still able to find a table. I'm normally a beer guy but decided to try some cocktails and get a glimpse of the bartenders in action. Drinks are set on fire, mixed by pouring multiple bottles into a single glass and tossing / throwing bottles between bartenders. The show greatly contributes to the overall experience.

It took a little time to place our first drink order but once we did, service greatly improved and we had no problems ordering for the rest of the night. When our server was busy, one of the bartenders actually left the bar and came over to take our order. Great teamwork & service! 

One of the bartenders introduced himself and started a conversation with us. When he found out we were from out of town, he brought us a round of shots on the house (and had one with us). A modest gesture but it left a big impact on me.

The drinks are really interesting and like nothing I had before. I tried the following:

1) The Zombie ($28). The price is high on this one but it's huge - many times the size of other cocktails. This drink had everything in it (I lost track of all the ingredients), it was fascinating to see it being made. Despite all the ingredients, the drink came together nicely.

2) Beef Jerky cocktail ($14) made with actual house made beef jerky (they also sell the beef jerky as a snack if your hungry). This drink is smokey in flavour with a large piece of beef jerky in the cocktail. Not sure I could drink this all night but definitely  worth a try.

3) Blazer Bastard ($14) was a warm / heated cocktail. The drink arrives at your table covered so it's warm when you start drinking it. Another unique drink experience.

Although this is clearly a cocktail bar, they had 8 beers on the menu including selections from St. Ambroise & Cheval Blanc.  

Note - If your from out of town, the servers speak english and the menus included English. The website appears to be french only.

I will definitely be back on my next Montreal trip. A great display, relaxed atmosphere and interesting drinks ensure you will have a great evening.

{"text":"The first time we tried coming here was late at night on a Friday - it was packed, we couldn't find a seat and ended up leaving. This time, we came during happy hour and were able to find seats right away (there were only handful of people there). We sat facing the bar where you could see bartenders spinning, whirring and juggling away while assembling drinks. 

Very friendly service, they provide great recommendations based on your preferences. Drinks were unique, creative and fairly strong (no complaints there) - add in the ambiance and it's a great place to be!"}
{"text":"We decided to check this bar out after seeing it on a few lists of must see places in Montreal when we were in town for a long weekend. Looked questionable from the outside but once inside it was awesome! I've never see such a variety of booze and mixing concoctions, the cocktail list is EXTENSIVE, expect to ask the bartenders (who were super friendly) for recommendations.  We happened to stroll in during happy hour (which goes until 8PM and a selection of drinks were $8 vs the usual $14+). My husband and I both had 2 of the La Citadelle - awesome and spicy!  I saw someone get the jack daniel's beef jerky drink that looked amazing and involved fire. Very very cool spot, def. a must visit.  We were raving about the cocktails the whole weekend.  No food though (unless you count the beef jerky)."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great feeling and vibe. Upscale experience with fantastic bartending flare. The bartenders are knowledgable and fun. I tried the Erskine Tribute. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place straddles the line between three stars and four stars, but I'm rounding up to four because it's truly the only somewhat decent cocktail bar in Montreal. No one is really doing mixology here in any serious way (other than Le Lab).

What's to like:
--Pretty decent music. The night we went there was a very capable DJ at the MacBook helm.
--Cool decor.
--Nice menu with good recommendations. 

What's not to like:
--Overstressed, underserving staff. It appeared one server was servicing all the tables, so she would disappear for looooooong stretches during which one might like to order another round or get more water or a check. She was overworked and, though sweet, just too slow by virtue of the setup.
--A bit TOO loud (so thankfully the music was good).
--$15 each for our less exciting cocktail round. STEEP for cocktails that would cost about $10-11 U.S. and really should have here, being not so special. (Our first round at $11 and $14 was much more exciting.)"}
{"text":"We went on a really cold night so it wasn't packed.  We had the bartender's full attention and asked lots of questions.  Unfortunately we couldn't try all the drinks that caught our imagination so we'll definitely have to go back.  A bit pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"Le Lab has that Dali meets Tiki room in a biker Johnny Cash bar sort of way. I could see The Rolling Stones set up an impromptu set for the cool locals who know where to hang and get great spirits. Everything from creative mixed drinks to Lagavulin reserve. Kelsey is the smartest, most stylish and best waitress in Montreal. A total professional and a great person."}
{"text":"What can I not say about this place?! My boyfriend and I were staying a block away for a weekend trip. It was our place to go for a \"nightcap\".  Lo-and-behold it was one of the coolest bars we've ever experienced and we are both bartenders. The bartenders/cocktail servers/host(ess) were so hospitable and lovely. Be sure to catch the \"fire show\" late night. We are telling EVERYONE about Le Lab. Best bar we've experienced in a really long time! Do yourself a favor and go! And they also gave the BEST recommendations for local restaurants/eateries. Darwin will keep you safe if a drunkard is hitting on you as well! Much love to all of the staff of Le Lab!  Miss you already!!"}
{"text":"You should know about Le Lab, if you like anything at all.

The building is a bit anonymous, located at the corner of Rachel and De Lanaudière. My friends and I stumbled in some time ago, without prior knowledge of the bar, because going to bed at 1:00 AM on a Wednesday is for conformists, apparently.

First time patrons will most likely be impressed by the tasteful decoration and ergonomic planning of the bar. The tables, high and not one of them wobbly, are dispersed to provide ample elbow room. Behind the bar proper, customers are invited to look at a truly staggering array of liquors and spirits, most of them SAQ rarities or straight up discoveries.

This is all good and well, but it's only a preview of Le Lab's true strength: its endless supply of original mixed drinks. The bar's menu is updated every six months with a new batch of creations, and none of them taste like anything you've ever had.

This might be a bit much for more casual drinkers, and the staff (Labtenders!) is always more than happy to guide your choice according to your preferences and drinking history. Want a drink that bites back? Here's a Margarita Enchilada, a tequila and tabasco potion so strong it almost fights your mouth. Would you prefer something sweet enough to pass for dessert in most restaurants? Here's the Sortilège, with enough maple and orange flavours to make its whiskey base a mere afterthought. There is truly something for everyone, as much as dislike clichés. 


In spite of all this alcoholic exuberance, you will find no drunks at Le Lab. Drinks start at 10$ each... during Happy Hour. Most cocktails will cost you around 13-15$ dollars, depending on tips. This strongly curbs the drunkard scale in favor of social sippers and foodies looking to taste something new. This price range, however, makes it a poor choice for a regular hangout.

Still, if blowing your entire booze budget on two drinks is turn-off, I invite you to muscle through an evening of relative sobriety to experience the Lab firsthand.  There's no such thing as a fast order there; Labtenders WILL take the time to flair the crap out of your drink. The showmanship is the best I've seen in the city and when you see the entire bar set on fire to light up five shooters, you will want to buy something expensive from these people, and tip them well.

In conclusion, even if the establishment tends to be somewhat exclusive because of the price of admission, you would do well to stop by at the first opportunity and treat yourself to one of the most serious, original and entertaining evenings in Montreal. Le Lab is right for you, whoever you are."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal on vacation looking for an awesome spot to hit on a Saturday night with the family. I saw the awesome review and figured i would check it out for myself.

If every bar held their standards to the level this place had, the world would be a better place. Four of us came in around 11 pm on Saturday night and got one of the best seats in the house right across from the bar. I immediately loved the decor, it was very dimly lit and cosy. The fabrics on one wall, the brick on another, the display of bottles behind the bar, the entire design was fantastic. The bar is extermely eye catching and the drinks did not disppaoint. You are paying anywhere from $10-$16 a drink but they are fantastic cocktails that you can tell some love was put into making them.

We did not try any of the food but we had about 6 drinks total and everyone was great. I immediately can spot a good bar when before even taking your order for a cocktail they bring you a glass of water. Not something everyone cares for but its responsible, and personally i like it. 

The bar tenders will spin and throw bottles, use fire, and do big swinging pours which is awesome to watch and it makes the entire experience a bit more exciting then your traditional bar.

I would absolutely recommend this place to a friend. Great drinks, great expereince, no complaints at all."}
{"text":"I came here at about 11pm on a saturday night and it was quite empty. Great drinks. I am a light weight drinker so I can't really give feedback on how strong the drinks are (every drink is strong to me..). But they have really fun and interesting ones. The place is definitely understaffed as I caught myself wondering if the server forgot about our orders, but it turns out he just had too many tables to take care of. They don't really have a good selection of bar food at night since kitchen closes at 10 or 10:30pm. They have stuff like popcorn, but no chicken tenders or fries.

I'm not sure how it is at a later time as We stayed for only a half hour before we headed somewhere else. Good place to pregame though!"}
{"text":"Coolest bar I visited in Montreal. I had the Chupacabra, Jerky Lab and we got flaming absinthe shots. All of which were delicious the best part is the show the Bartenders put on keeps you entertained the whole night."}
{"text":"A great artisinal cocktail bar in Montreal.  

The space looks a bit like a speakeasy and has wine barrel covers and casual seating for lounging and drinking.  The stars though are the friendly servers and the great drinks.  

I love great cocktails and the ones at Le Lab were creative, delicious and strong.  

Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable and although English wasn't her super strong suit, she was personable and recommended the right drinks galore.  Favorites of the night were the Nirvana and the Jerky Lab Jerk.  

It's a popular spot and really started our night off.  We learned a few French phrases, got a list of spots to hit for both food and merriment and continued our fun at the faraway Joe Beef.  

Le Lab accepts credit cards."}
{"text":"C'est cher. Très cher même. Mais c'est une expérience unique car un des rare endroit à servir de l'absinthe et aillant une clientèle plus mature. Donc, excellent pour une date."}
{"text":"Really nice place with friendly bartenders, but really pricy drinks. $35 for two drinks and tip. No thanks. 

We were there on a Friday night and the place was relatively dead. Like one other person said, it wasn't really anything to write about. We just weren't feeling it."}
{"text":"Crazy fancy cocktails that blew my mind seven ways to Sunday. In a quaint neighborhood that has a \"locals only\" feel, so the place wasn't swarming with tourists. I plan on going back the next time we're in Montreal."}
{"text":"Enfin un bar à cocktail digne de ce nom sur Montréal !

Le bar est immense, la sélection des bouteilles est top, le service est impeccable, la tenue des barmans est soignée.

La carte des cocktails est très complète, les cocktails sont variés, y'en a pour tous les goûts ! Et même pour toutes les bourses, avec les premiers cocktails décrits qui sont en HH (non pas Heil Hitler, Happy Hour ! pourriture fasciste).

Et c'est sur ces premiers cocktails, que je vous conseille vivement le Tic&Tac Sour ! Whisky et liqueur de noisette façon sour, un régal, très bien balancé, top !
La petite marguerite est aussi très sympa dans les cocktails à petit prix.

Sinon dans la collection Tiki, le Pain Killer est bien réussi. à conseiller donc.

Bien dommage que ce bar soit excentré, car pour moi, il reste la référence pour les bars à cocktails de Montréal, un exemple à suivre."}
{"text":"Such a fun bar with outstanding drinks and friendly service. My husband and I braved the Montréal cold to walk here from Ma Poule Mouillée (which was also amazing). We saddled up to the bar, noting the trendy, yet cozy atmosphere. Upon sitting at the bar, Darwin the bartender helped us make a decision from the prettiest little bar menu I've ever seen. He was an expert mixologist who had a remarkable level of precision creating our drinks. He served us 5 different delicious cocktails throughout the evening, creating the most unusually delicious concoctions we've ever tasted. My favorites were the Mary Poppins, Pomme de Pins, and the Ananas Flambé (it was actually on fire!!) I would highly recommend sitting at the bar and watching the mixology take place. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Idéalement situé, à 2 pas du métro Berri UQAM, un peu caché à l'entrée d'un immeuble, ce bar saura vous surprendre à bien des égards!
D'abord, vous entrerez derriere un grand rideau noir, et atteindrez une piece sombre et joliment décorée, en mode ambiance chaleureuse et intimiste
Ensuite, vous serez accueilli par l'un des serveurs super sympathique, que ce soit la jeune femme ou l'un des gars; ils pourront d'ailleurs très bien vous conseiller sur les menus, que ce soit pour les drinks ou pour la nourriture
Après, vous serez surpris par le choix des drinks, surtout des cocktails, qui font la réputation du Lab..
Enfin, vous pourrez savourer la délicieuse bouffe faite de produits frais et selon l'inspiration du moment des chefs
Si avec tout ça je ne vous ai pas convaincu de l'essayer... ;)"}
{"text":"Extensive menu of creative drinks, but not too different that the hordes of similar cocktail bars that've seemingly opened up in every major city in North America."}
{"text":"Adored my detour into this cute, turn-of-the-century inspired bar. The drinks are decadent and ridiculous but tasty and unique. The bartenders were very kind and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming, perfect for a solo nightcap in the snow."}
{"text":"Un très bon bar à cocktails!! Je suis arrivée vers 22h un vendredi avec mon copain et il n'y avait pas de place, mais le proprietaire est venu nous recevoir et nous a dit que surement il y aurai des places dans pas longtemps (et c'etait vrai). Il y a une place dans l'entrée pour laisser les manteaux. Le ménu est vraiment sympa, pour tous les goûts! Après une vingtaine de minutes on s'est assis dans une très bonne place. Les cocktails étaient très bons et avec une bonne quantité d'alcool. À minuit le serveur a commencé a faire un show avec les bouteilles et du feu et c'était vraiment impressionant!! C'est un peu cher, mais ça vaut vraiment le coup. On est allés pour avoir une date romantique et on a passé une très bonne soirée! Finalement le proprietaire est venu pour nous dire au revoir et on a parlé un peu avec lui, et il était vraiment sympa. Le staff était aussi très gentil avec nous. :-)"}
{"text":"Endroit très sympa, bien situé, juste à coté du Parc Lafontaine, en plein cur du plateau!
Les cocktails sont vraiment originaux (gingembre, absinthe, concombre, etc..) et très bons, et la serveuse pourra très bien vous conseiller!
Il y a un 6@8 qui vaut la peine pour les prix, sur certains cocktails
A l'intérieur, c'est tout noir, il y a quand même beaucoup de places assises
Une bonne place pour passer un bon moment entre amis!
A essayer!"}
{"text":"This place had a great atmosphere and good drinks! The only problem was that it took an hour and a half for four drinks to come. The service wasn't great and it took forever. Tried multiple times to call someone over for the check because no one paid any attention. When I was paying with my card, the waitress had to remind me that service tip was not included in the bill.... even though she never checked up on us and didn't really give us any service...

Also note: we were sitting at a table, not the bar"}
{"text":"Bar Le Lab - Quartier des Spectacles is a great extension to Bar Le Lab on Rachel. Newly opened this bar's atmosphere is a modern twist on the original, with speakeasy style music, the inviting atmosphere inspires conversation and good times. Their extensive cocktail menu continues to be impressive with the Jerky Lab Jack being a personal favourite. They boast a small list of snacking items, but don't let the name fool you, you can get everything from charcuterie to hummus and cracked pepper goat cheese. If you're feeling really adventurous, try the punches with some friends."}
{"text":"Le Lab is the place to go to for cocktails in Montreal. It is more than just a bar where you can get some drinks. Le Lab is a revolutionary bar where cocktails are created at the intersection of art and science (yeah, I went there).

Here is what you need to know:
1. The place can get so busy. If you go right when it opens, it'll be pretty empty at the bar but tables are generally reserved for all the hours that Le Lab is open.
2. You have so many options. There's the rotating menu, specials written on a whiteboard hanging above the bar, and basically anything you want can be created here. 
3. Why art and science you say? To make my drink, the bartender LIT IT ON FIRE and mixed it with flames engulfing the tequila. My friend's drink was served in a multi-tiered teapot.
4. The drinks are strong.
5. It's more of a small group of friends vibes.
6. Mostly locals, some tourists.
7. Service is great.

I can't recommend Le Lab enough if you love cocktails and are in Montreal. It's a place you have to check out and experience."}
{"text":"When Asilex Rodriguez (search her on Instagram!) is bartending, it is MORE than worth coming here  mind you, she usually only works at the rue Rachel location. Amazingly friendly laid back service & phenomenally mixed drinks (she does fantastic tricks!!!) from an extremely talented & intellectually intriguing person... my review update on this bar gets 5stars just because I stumbled in on the right night."}
{"text":"I'm so sad that we don't have one a Le Lab in Dallas. This bar totally sealed my love for Montreal. What a treat!!! If you love craft cocktails with a speakesy feel definitely check this place out. Baptiste will take care of you."}
{"text":"Baptiste blew our world. Great craft cocktails and a speakesy feel. We were there for hours and it didn't feel like it. Just ask him to make you a drink based on your favorite liquor and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Their charcuterie plate was lovely! Came here for happy hour with some friends and the place is nice, we went on a quiet night so it wasn't noisy. I don't really drink alchohol so I had to stick with water but it came with a nice cucumber so it wasn't completely boring. My friends enjoyed their drinks even though they were a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Bar très sympa. Ambiance feutrée et cocktails originaux. Music live le mercredi soir. Une petite adresse qui vaut le détour! Carte des grignotines (tres bonnes) à étoffer."}
{"text":"My friend and I had been exploring the city for a couple of hours on foot and stumbled upon this bar and were quite delighted. We even made it back the following night.
Amazing list of cocktails and superb selection of bourbons. Try the Betty Boobs and the Baby Dragon cocktails. We didn't care for the Japanese Gimlet (flavors did not work together) or the cocktail with beef jerky in it. Yuck. 
Great atmosphere. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. And the bartenders are fun to watch as they make concoctions. I saw flames, juggling of bottles and precision. The prices weren't over-the-top; I thought they were fair considering the time and detail it took to produce a cocktail.
Next time I'm in Montreal I'll be back at Le Lab!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm not much of a bar person... I usually find these places too crowded and noisy for me but I do like a good original cocktail once in a while so this place was recommended.
It was friday night and it's downtown so expect the place to get very busy very quickly. The lighting is intimate verging on the pitch dark and they have a live dj pushing the decibels to the max.
We got there early, before the masses, and got two seats at the bar just to watch the \"chemists\" do their things.
One of the bartender was super nice and funny... Unfortuntaly, we got the other one who I hope was just having a bad day. He was rude and arrogant, not just with us but with many of the people who ordered with him.
The cocktails we tried (Not-for-the-goonies, vent-de-provence and bébé-dragon) were all quite good and usually served in an original way (glasses and all). They are quite expensive which I wouldn't mind if on top of being good, the service was good too."}
{"text":"Le Lab really turned us onto the modern cocktail scene. We have since searched across the US and Europe and while a couple come close, NONE are better. Five years later, we still drive 5-6 hours to come here for NYE every year with a mix of friends. My favorite is the Tiger Thai Collins. Menu changes, always amazing, new, and creating new melds of flavors. We've ordered the syrups online for home use. If you are the driver, etc, you can opt for a non-alcoholic mix - crafted just as carefully! Love, love, love Le Lab!!"}
{"text":"Brand new bar. No one here. Amazing Victorian, Industrial atmosphere and the cocktail menu is outstanding. There is something for everything here. Also, Eric, the bartender, is amazing. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"It's ok, the drinks are ok but expensive! The staff is ok a bit annoying but knowledgeable. The fire show was awesome but not really worth it, did I mention the drinks are expensive and not that good!"}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest cocktail bars I have ever been too in my life! The fire cocktails and flare bartending is incredible. Be sure to sit in the middle of the bar for an amazing show. I had the Lab Jack, the Perfect Martini, an Old Fashioned, and the Apple fire thing (forget the name) then a Old Fashioned made with Gin and fresh lemon grass.

Jerky Lab Jack - This cocktail is amazing. It is made from Jack Daniels, their own homemade BBQ bitters, and some other stuff. It is awesome to watch it being made. They mix up some liquor, set it on fire, spray on the BBQ Bitters which makes a giant flame (se my photos) then throw on ice and JD. It's finished with a piece of beef jerky. Very tasty; a smokey BBQ taste. Its good.

Perfect Martini - This drink was crazy. They make a martini like you usually would except instead of ice they use a volumetric flask and dip it into liquid nitrogen to cool the cocktail. They also chill the glass with liquid nitrogen. The result is an amazing perfectly made martini - no dilution. 

Old Fashioned - this was a great old fashioned. First they sprayed the glass with Absinthe, then the usual sugar, orange, bitters, and Markers Mark. It was almost perfect just wish they would have used Augusto Bitters as opposed to Perrins. The Absinthe was a nice touch and added a complexity to the drink. I'm going to try that at home now.

Apple Fire thing - I forget the name but this cocktail was CRAZY! They take a small pot, put in a bunch of brandy and a chopped up apple. They then cook the Apple and warm the drink with a torch, then they set it on fire and pour the flaming mixture between two pots to make a fire show. When its served to you you first pull off the glass, inhale the alcohol vapor, then eat the apple pieces finish by sipping the warm drink. This is a great winter drink. Very tasty; not to sweet or strong. Perfect. It's worth ordering just to watch them make it; it is a show on its own.

Gin old Fashioned - this was my favorite drink of all. It was made with fresh Lemon grass, and gin, orange, sugar, and bitters. Really tasty and smooth. I love this drink...

So please check out this bar. It is a great place. nice atmosphere, great music and vibe, not much I would change about the place. I just hope I can find something like this in San Fran."}
{"text":"The manager (serving us) was rude, disrespectful and clearly had no respect for our group. We waited over 30 minutes just to order our drinks and had to remind him we were waiting...
He then made snarky remarks to multiple people in our group and started questioning why someone in our group was ordering a non-alcoholic beverage. Not only will I not return but I will make it loud and clear how the entitled manager made our first experience there absolutely awful. This is unfortunate because the drinks were great (thank you Mr. Bartender) but because of your inexperienced manager with no tact or respect, I will never be back."}
{"text":"This is the best bar that I have ever been to hands down. I can see getting cocktails of this quality in NYC for twice the price and without the super welcoming attitude, but I've still never had cocktails this good anywhere else. Our bartender was so friendly and treated us like we were old friends visiting Montreal. She asked for flavors that we liked and would make something outstanding based on our preferences. The bartenders here truly are artists!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously underrated. The drinks are PHENOMENAL true mixology goes down at this bar and the drinks do not disappoint. The ambiance and vibe is super cool and the music is on-point. Would highly recommend this bar!"}
{"text":"This place is one in a million. They are fantastic with their cocktails creations plus they taste so good. One of my favourite cocktail places in Montreal. Love it."}
{"text":"I am not one to write Yelp reviews, but we were on a girls trip to Montreal and decided to go here due to the prior good review.  This place is so good that we went back for a 2nd night.  Delicious and interesting cocktails, absinthe, and flair bartending combined for a fantastic night!   You will find drinks here that you would never find anywhere else, one I tried had a raw egg in it, one vanilla foam on the top, one with real creme bruelle.  Definitely recommend and will be back next time I visit."}
{"text":"What an incredible bar! The decor and atmosphere were incredible, and the bartenders were so friendly and knowledgeable. I had a great time watching them mix drinks behind the bar with incredible precision and attention to detail. My friends and I each ordered a different drink, and the drinks were all pricey but fantastic. The drinks that stood out in my mind were the Chinatown (like a Moscow mule but better), the Dali-Labma (the elderflower was such an interesting taste), and behind the bar (smoky, strong, and well balanced- the bartender confessed this to be her favorite as well). 
This was overall an incredible experience, and I have never enjoyed drinks more than the ones I had here."}
{"text":"this bar was INCREDIBLE !  there are so many cocktails to choose from , but rest assured when I asked the bartender (who was much more than a bartender )for a recommendation he was great at helping me make a decision . after my first drink he could tell my style right away . all of the bartenders had great personalities and put on an amazing show mixing drinks and flairing. would recommend everyone visiting Montreal to try this place !!"}
{"text":"Excellent cocktail bar in the Plateau area. Highly recommend stopping here before or after dinner for some lovely drinks. There is an excellent Happy Hour menu featuring $8 cocktails. All are well-balanced. There are two scenes here: early and late. Early on it's quiet and will remind you of a turn-of-the-century parlor. Prohibition-style, of course. You'll be able to sit at the bar and enjoy the repose of a strong cocktail without the buzz of the city weighing you down. Late night, forget the repose. It's loud, it's raucous, it's crowded. Fight your way to the bar and get some shots in addition to the cocktail. Loud music, lots of noise. Both scenes have their appeal and their downsides - it all depends what suits your mood. Rest assured, you won't be disappointed by the cocktail menu. Most cocktails are priced around CAD $13-15. Wonderful variations on mint juleps. Salut!"}
{"text":"Best drink we've ever had 10/10. The bartender was cool with an ever cooler mustache. A lil pricey but it's definitely worth it. The atmosphere is really cute too. Lots of dangly light bulbs, they're not just for lighting they're just great"}
{"text":"YES. 100% YES. Niko's the man! We went right around 5pm when they opened so it wasn't too busy yet. We sat at the bar and received great service. Niko was able to make custom cocktails for all of us based on our taste preferences and each one was perfectly concocted. He even suggested some speakeasy cocktail bars to try around Montreal that we would've never known about otherwise.

We loved it so much we came back the very next evening for another round of drinks. Unfortunately Niko wasn't working, but the lady working there was just as great. It was quite a bit busier this time but we still received customized service. She was very engaging and humorous and was so entertaining watching her artfully concoct all the drinks -- what a show!"}
{"text":"Le Lab is part of Trip Advisors must go to bars in Montreal. After my visit, I can see why. We were greeted by a friendly bartender who went into details explaining the distinguished and selective cocktail menu. At a glance they can seem a bit confusing but, once you seen the presentation and delivery they make you want to order more! Professional mixologist work here not your typical bartender that mix vodka and tonic. Exquisite flavored in every drink! A must to visit"}
{"text":"The place has a pretty classy feel with music that really makes you want to dance. Staff was super nice and is very willing to explain the drinks and figure out what we might like. I should of take advantage of that... I got the one called Banane? and it was way too strong for me! lol my friends thought so too. So strong that we ended up using it for our drinking games and whoever loses has to sip a bit of it. I ended up drinking most of my drink and woke up the next morning with a slight burning sensation in my stomach... It's okay, pepto-bismol helped haha."}
{"text":"All of wizardry, theatrics and tinctures you could possibly want in a cool urban residential neighborhood comfortably distant from touristy downtown area. It is stumbling distance from Au Pied de Cochon and the walk helped us work off a fraction of the calories.  The bartenders are skilled but the guy practicing bar tricks and constantly dropping the bottle was distracting.   Just practice at home until you are ready for the big show."}
{"text":"BRILLIANT!! This is my new fave bar in Montreal, hands down. I've been wanting to come here for months, and finally had the chance. I'm not sure I'll go anywhere else again. 
It's all about the craft of cocktail mixing at Le Lab, which well-informed servers and bartenders take great pride in here. I've now had Le Lab cocktails that blow the socks off any cocktail I've ever had, anywhere. 
Extreme creativity goes into crafting these liquid delights, not only in the combination of exquisite ingredients, but also in the naming and presentation. 

Let me give a few divine examples:

CHUPACABRA (named after a frightening creature of Latin American fame that eats children) - Comes thick and bloody-looking in a martini glass - Beet syrup, grapefruit bitters, chipotle tabasco, egg white, lime, curacao Pierre Ferrand and Cazadores tequila
Taste: ***** (impeccable)

UNION PACIFIC (for cross-continent travelers like me) - Comes in a low champagne glass, perfect for making toasts - Cardamom and curry bitters, Old Timer tonic syrup, lime, mandarin and Pisco (a Chilean liquor)
Taste: **** (Perfect if you love a punchy cardamom and curry taste - delightfully sweet and bitter together)

RENAISSANCE (for elegant ladies - they say, \"Remembering a pilgrimage to the Sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin of Miracles in Saronna...\") - comes in a low champagne glass with a hot pink orchid propped against the side (orchid is edible) - Lavender bitters, China China amaro, Thyme Bigallet and Di Saronno Amaretto
Taste: ***** (delicate, balanced, miraculous really)

CALAMITY JESS (a true mouthful of magic) - Comes in a low glass with a snifter turned upside down and holding in the liquor steam that accumulates after the drink has been lit aflame - Peach and vanilla bitters, cherry syrup, water, Benedictine and Jim Beam Black bourbon - the magic is in the first inhalation of steam that's been captured by the snifter, which you lift off and inhale before your first sip
Taste: ***** (pure witchcraft)

Also, dears - FLAMBE SHOTS
The COULEUR CAFE is some serious delicious action. It requires a minor tutorial before you are allowed to consume it. You must sip it with a straw slid into the flaming liquid, because, well -flaming beards- and ringlets otherwise. This is epic-ally delicious - Tia Maria, Amarula and Absinthe. Taste: *****

I could go on, but that's a small sampling of the beautiful cocktail paradise that exists here. There is a massive, well-designed booklet of a booze menu that includes no less than 13 types of absinthe, an extremely decked out gin selection, nearly two full pages of whiskeys, a good selection of local beers, rums and tequilas and mescals, nonalcoholic mocktails for the pregnant ladies, as well as a small selection of their own handcrafted syrups (ie. Hell's Ginger, Tiki 1930, Tropical BBQ, etc) - I will be picking up one of those treasures the next time I'm there, which likely won't be too long from now. 

This is an extraordinarily long review, but this is an extraordinary bar, a true mixologists' dream. 

Tip: everybody in the know wants to come here. Call ahead to reserve a table if you're smart! 

Beautiful interior and cushy décor. Very classy. If you like dressing up, this is your chance. Otherwise, casual is ok. But, this is a perfect place to live out a fantasy.

PS - they also have a small but refined selection of table snacks, too, if you're feeling nibbly."}
{"text":"Second bar I visited from Montreal and went mostly for the Jerky Lab Jack! The bar was also celebrating National Tequila Day (yay!) so there was a deal on $3 tequila shots! So in order, we had two tequila shots, and the Lab Jack and the Zombie cocktail (typically made for two people but I accepted this challenge). 

Tequila shots didn't come with salt, but at least it came with the lime. Nothing new about these shots compared to what I could've ordered in the States, but the deal was hard to pass up.

The Lab Jack was 'tres super cool' with its little pulley holding the beef jerky! The jerky was thick-cut, and from where we sat, we heard it being loudly tenderized at the bar. I wish we had more jerky, only because it was seasoned and tenderized so well without being overly-salty like most store-bought jerkies are. The liquor was served in a what I believe was a real copper cup, and VERY strong and bitter, so if you're a fan of dark liquor with a tolerance for a lingering aftertaste, you are considered tough in my book. Needless to say, really neat order, but I stuck with just chewing on the jerky by itself while my boyfriend finished off the drink.

The Zombie was LARGE, and is originally made as a cocktail for two. Beautifully presented with a flower, it's seemingly harmless and could be seen as a juicy drink. Definitely was juicy, but alcohol content was way up there and within minutes, I felt my buzz. If you're a regular drinker and want to have a good time without taking bitter shots and/or spending too much money, sit on this drink yourself and you'll feel great by the end of it. 

Overall, service was excellent (shout out to the waiters for being accommodating with my broken French), drinks were well-worth the money, and the only thing I can really complain about was how dark the whole place was, but I guess it was going for that cozy, underground-bar feeling!"}
{"text":"Amazing drinks and shots! Make sure to try one from every category  and take a shot with fire, but mind your hair."}
{"text":"This frequently popped up on Best Bars in Montreal, and I can see why. The bartenders take their drinks very seriously and I don't blame them because they are awesome! This is a really nice place to take your date or a group of friends for a quiet pre-game night, or if going solo and you just want a fancy drink. HH is the best time to go and they are very helpful in giving suggestions on what to drink. Def a spot to go to!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Always have a good time. However, the music is a little too loud so it's hard to talk to your friends or even the poor waiter. Drinks are always on point and mixologists are very entertaining at the bar. I love that they always keep updating their menu so there's always something new"}
{"text":"On a Tuesday night my friend and I were the only ones in here.  The only ones.  That should have been a sign..lol.

I can see how highly rated this place is by many other reviewers but honestly I just wasn't feeling it (same with my friend).  We sat at the bar and ordered a drink each - both were ok.  Nothing to write about - so I won't.

I will say however the décor is nice - interesting artwork, low lighting with a kind of speakeasy vibe to it.  Service was ok - but I wouldn't expect any different since we were the only ones in there (I suspect for most of the night it was empty).

Maybe on a Friday or Saturday night it might be busy and that might change my opinion of it..but everything just felt dead."}
{"text":"Great underrated bar in Montreal. Nice interior, very chill with excellent professional staff. Our bartender was friendly and made some great drinks for us. We would definitely comeback again."}
{"text":"When New Orleanians vacation elsewhere, it's important for us to know the best bars in the city that we're visiting.  There's research and what not...we take our cocktails serious.

Le Lab definitely did not disappoint!!  I was pleasantly shocked that the staff was so friendly, since snobby/rude bartenders are apparently the cool thing at craft cocktail bars in the US right now.  Eddy and Fabien are extremely knowledgeable and love to talk about their craft.  The drink menu was extensive and had a nice selection of summer cocktails....and any place that carries sazerac and can make a top-notch Corpse Reviver #2 wins in my book!!!  They also make their own syrups which are for sale to the public...try the ginger, it's the best!

If you live in Montreal, I'm extremely jealous that you could visit this place on a regular basis.  Go there tout suite!!!"}
{"text":"I accidentally clicked on a review of this bar searching for ideas on where to go in NDG.  The descriptions, reviews and website of the bar looked so neat that I HAD to go.  I'm very glad I did.  The premise of the bar is ole' timey mixology. The menu is as extensive as it is expensive!  Mixed drinks average at around 13$, and go as high as 28$!  I will warn you though, not only are they worth is, but once you have one, you'll want to try them all.  

The bar itself is beautiful; the doors are draped in red curtains, the bar is the most fully stocked one I've ever seen, the TV flashes anti-prohibition ads and the brick walls just seal the deal.  The blackboard above the bar features daily specials, which are worth trying.  

The bar and wait staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  There's no pretension at all.   The waiters and waitresses are more than happy to answer questions about drinks.  The bar staff practice flair bar tending; depending on when you go, you'll probably see some bottle juggling, spice smashing or maybe even a bit of a fire show!  I got to see all three.  

This is easily my new favorite bar in Montreal.  I'm so glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"I decided to surprise a couple of lovely Yelper friends who were already checked-in.

Visually, the decor is thoughtfully laid out. It's relaxing and intimate and not overtly sensual or themed as far as I noticed. Sort of a tasteful French ambiance that I can really dig. The bar has an impressive selection that showcased various liquors.

Our mixologist (Gabrielle?) was amazingly friendly and had this really cute french accent I couldn't help but ask where she was from. She was very accommodating particularly after some coaching from my Yelp friends to let her create a drink for me, which you'll see enclosed below.

One thing is for sure, they take their mixology pretty seriously. I watched her mix up my drink and she looked like she knew what she was doing. The cocktail was delicious and left me wanting more but alas, my visit was short and had other plans.

One thing is for sure, I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Best bartenders ever!   Very educated on their product and were willing to teach the customers the finer points without hesitation."}
{"text":"Nice small, speakeasy type of bar. It has amazingly creative drinks (so if that's your thing, you will definitely want to come here). We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the bartender prepare drinks. Some are quite elaborate!

We had been told that the bartenders do a \"fire show\", with tossing fire bottles and getting the crowd riled up but apparently that is only on Fri/Sat so be aware. We came on a Sun after Christmas and it was pretty quiet."}
{"text":"Good cocktails and bartender 'consultations,' but not up to the impeccable standards of some other leading North American high-end speakeasy type bars I've been to, for instance, Drink in Boston, or (maybe surprisingly) Williams & Graham in Denver. 

On the weekday night I was there, the bartender I spoke with grew a little impatient with my questions about different drinks and ingredients-- I went on for a little while, but really was not overlong. This sort of peremptoriness wouldn't have occurred at the former two places, where 'mixologists' seem enthused (or at least are trained to seem so) to talk about cocktails and their histories at length. 

Drinks here are considerably more expensive than at the former two (around $14, compared to around $12/11), so one would expect quality and service to be on par, but this isn't quite the case. The ambiance is nice, about as pleasant. 3.5 stars. If cocktails were priced a little more reasonably, would have given it 4."}
{"text":"An amazing little place! 12 pages of unique house made cocktails- many with their own flavors and extractions. Great low key atmosphere in the Mont Royal neighborhood. Bartenders are extremely knowledgeable and fearless in recommending something you might never try otherwise. Highest recommendation."}
{"text":"At this point in my life, I don't care much for flair bartending and would rather enjoy a carefully crafted cocktail. Luckily, Le Lab is famous for the former but can easily provide the latter!
I was afraid it would be one of those overhyped places, all show and no substance, but I am glad it was not the case.
I guess we were lucky to go there on a Monday night, which was very quiet. The bartender explained that they only do the flair thing when they have a crowd for it and since the place was rather empty there was none of that, which was great for us. We really like our drinks, which were very original, using some pretty unique ingredients.
So I guess if you want to experience their awesome creations and relax, go there during the week!"}
{"text":"Simplement dit, j'adore Le Lab. À prime à bord, il faut savoir que je suis une fan finie des cocktails et de la mixologie. C'est d'ailleurs pourquoi j'aime autant cette place. Chaque bar staff connaît vraiment bien son métier et traite son oeuvre comme un art. Ils ont développé leur propre gamme de sirops simples et ils ont probablement la plus grande sélection de spiritueux et variété de bitters en ville! Outre ça, j'aime beaucoup leur décor plus sombre et riche qui me donne vraiment l'impression d'être ailleurs lorsque j'y suis. 

Bref, une vraie équipe passionnée qui sait toujours te faire une concoction à ton goût et qui sont heureux de t'expliquer comment chaque saveur se complémente et s'accompagne."}
{"text":"I was shocked that we managed to get a seat after waiting only thirty minutes; we came at 9 pm on a Saturday night, so of course the line was nearly spilling out the door. Our server didn't handle the crowd very well, and it took a long time for us to get our order in and drinks when they were ready. I made the mistake of ordering the Zombie goblet, which is listed under a punch bowl. I chalked up the hefty $25 price tag to what I thought would be a generous serving, but was only slightly bigger than a pint. It tasted exactly as you would expect of the strongest liquors thrown together: not great, but if you have the money and want to get drunk, go for it.

My friend got the strange jerky lab jack, which came out with a piece of jerky on a mini-pulley. It was better than the zombie for sure. Everyone else also got flaming shots. Fire seems to be a key theme here. I had a bad seat, but the bartenders started doing some kind of flamethrowing show while we were there that everyone ooh-ed and ah-ed over. Everyone else, my friends included, seemed to be having a great time, so I figure four stars is fair. I was just disappointed that we kept hearing this was The Best Bar in all of Montreal, and it didn't quite live up to that."}
{"text":"Pas possible de mettre 3.5 donc 3.

Les cocktails sont bons mais parfois un peu plus cher que dans certains autres bars. Cependant la qualité est là donc cela n'est pas trop si dérangeant au final. Le service est bien.

Par contre un point négatif à mon sens et qu'ils ne prennent pas débit et qu'on peut seulement faire 3 factures pour une table. Pas très pratique quand on est un gros groupe.
Et puis petit aléa on avait la clim qui a commencé à nous couler dessus, au moins cela nous a rafraîchi :D"}
{"text":"Well I think this is the best time my wife and I had fun at a bar collectively.

Cocktails aren't exactly cheap, but are reasonable for New York City, so we have no gripes with the cost. But the presentation and the nuances in each cocktail make this place stand out. My wife, who normally sulks, loved the place.

Tony, and his manager, made the experience incredibly enjoyable, and ended the night with what I feared was the bar lighting on fire (everything ended just fine). Worth a visit, and we'll be back if we're ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Cocktails were amazing. Best we have ever had. The bartenders were friendly and suggested a few places to go in Montreal. Would recommend 10/10."}
{"text":"Belle ambiance ! Beau bar . Mes cocktails  étaient délicieux et les huîtres succulentes."}
{"text":"super bar les cocktails sont bon  un peu chère , mais ça va. Belle animation que font des  serveurs avec du feu . La nourriture est bien ."}
{"text":"Le Lab is a pretty fantastic spot to grab a cocktail or to 'drink' outside the box with the absinthe experience or a flaming shot. 

We took a seat at the welcoming bar and right away were served cucumber water. Very nice touch. Everything about this place with a sexy, lounge-y, dark, speakeasy vibe was really quite perfect. The mood lighting, the playful French music, the modern meets vintage feel, the handsome bartenders clad in prohibition era garb and of course the very extensive cocktail menu with some incredibly innovative gems as well as some seasonal specials on the chalkboard menu. 

This place has the best of both worlds... a perfect mix of old meets new which I am such a fan of. It's done so incredibly right here. For example, they offer an entire page of just gins and classic hard drinks, but also a plethora of carefully crafted cocktails as well as an entire page of ones they light on fire! Le Lab also has a few modern touches such as subway tiles, geometric tiles and exposed brick as well as vintage photos, a vintage cash register, textured wallpaper and ornate mirrors and vanities. Love it! A ton of personality is found here in the decor, the offerings and even the wording in the menu. 

We each chose one of their creative cocktails for $15 Canadian we absolutely LOVED!! 

\"Pumpkin Paste\" which had butter orange Regans, purée de courage, gingerbread syrup, dry Curaçao, Pierre Fernrand & Couvoisier 

\"Matcha Misu\" which was topped with matcha powder and coconut. It had mascarpone in it! 

A lot of thought went into the design of every single aspect of the place right down to the drink garnish. This is not just a bar, it's an experience. 

If I lived here this would absolutely be my favorite place to grab a drink and I highly, highly recommend stopping by here! Perfect date night spot."}
{"text":"I have never seen a bartender so excited to prepare a drink.  As she was describing the drink she wanted to prepare, she was practically shaking. Great to see such enthusiasm.

Watching the bartenders prepare the drinks was like watching a great chemist in the lab - poetry in motion as the add the various bitters, spray perfumes on the top, etc.

I had the tropical Gibson.  The pickled pineapple was pretty interesting.  Everyone at our table was amazed at how well-balanced the flavors of their drinks were.  When making these kind of exotic boissons, it would be easy to go over the top with any particular flavor, but that was not the case here.

We left happy and a little tipsy.

If you are into truly great cocktails, try this place.  Haven't experienced anything like it since New York city."}
{"text":"Wow what a lounge! My hubs and i while on vacation made it a point to do and see as much as we could. In doing so we probably drank more than we should,as we walked around the city we would stumble upon a place that looked cool so we would take a break and have a drink. 

   Le Lab was one of those places. we walked in on a Thursday at 10pm. I was so surprised that we were the only people in the bar. That lasted for about an hour and then it became a popping tiki-esque lounge. The cocktails we had were out of this world awesome. The choice of bitters alone was staggering. Ever flavor imaginable, which made for some pretty terrific cocktails. My favorite drink had to be the jerky Lab Jack, featuring a base of Jack Daniels, BBQ bitters or mist, and a small clothes line featuring a sizable piece of beef jerky. 

    I also had the pleasure of having an award winning mint julep made by the man who won the title. It was absolutely phenomenal and exactly the cocktail to enjoy amid the humidity of summer. 

   While there we also had the opportunity to talk to one of the owners/investors, Daniel. Who was one of the sweetest and coolest dudes we met while on our travels. He filled us in on the top places to grab a drink. We talked about the differences between the city of Montreal and Toronto. The latter may just be our future home. 

  I am so glad we stopped in, and if you ever find yourself in the area you should stop in too!"}
{"text":"This is the original home of true mixology and cocktail culture in Montreal, and a must if you are adventuring through all this sweet, adventurous town has to offer. Gabrielle and Fabien have worked relentlessly to foster true knowledge about the history and potentialities of spirits. They are magicians who will make a cure for whatever ails you, speak to you with calm professionalism and an undisguised passion for they work, and casually juggle fire when the spirit moves them. They have trained the next generation of award-winning mixologists in Montreal, crafted their own homemade bitters and syrups, and generally up'ed the local drink game with all their love and hard work. Someone give them a medal. 

The bar is simple, dark, cozy and playful. You can bring friends here who don't give a hoot about fancy cocktails and they can order an inexpensive beer and tasty snacks while you indulge in the inventiveness and creativity behind the bar, and maybe make new friends who share your interests (no judgement! We don't all have to like the same things!)

The spot is hidden in plain site, on a lovely mostly residential street facing the green rolling haven of bikes and picnics that is Parc Lafontaine. Tuck yourself in to let a few hours unfold in the dark drinking potions, then enjoy the outside world in a brand new way all over again."}
{"text":"Ambiance géniale, service exceptionnel. Parfait pour une bière ou un cocktail! J'ai adoré!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!  Amazing place with amazing drinks!! Great service and the Drinks are all yummy!!! Bartenders can create drinks that are not on the menu."}
{"text":"Although we had a bit of trouble finding Le Lab (thanks to none of us having international phone plans, a cabbie who apparently was unfamiliar with Montreal's geography, despite telling us everything about where the gangs are; and the address being listed as 351 on some websites), we finally made it with a couple hours to spare before closing time. It's a dimly lit area that makes it feel like a speakeasy, but with pop music blaring and a much louder vibe than you'd find at a quiet bar. We sat at a table that could fit our party that was closer to the entrance, and our waitress was good about coming over and taking our (rather frequent) drinks orders and being a good sport about it despite us being English speakers.

As for the drinks themselves, they're definitely a bit on the pricey side (everything seemed to be in the $12-15 range, which is basically NYC prices), but they were pretty good overall. The Jerky Lab Jack is pretty much a must-try, as it's a house specialty. I'm not a huge fan of whiskey on the rocks (which is pretty much what this looks like), but it turned out quite well - the BBQ bitters add a hint of spiced flavor that Jack on its own doesn't have, and the beef jerky itself (which is good - well-flavored, and not too chewy, with the right amount of toughness) helps to temper the edge on the drink. Jay's Basilic also turns out quite well; the basil serves more to provide an herbal whiff as you sip on the drink, which is heavily based on the raspberry but delicious without being overly fruity. The Tiger Thai Collins is also really good - the chili adds a dash of spice, but aside from that, it has a very bubbly and refreshing taste to it.

In all, the drinks here are all pretty well-done. I do also like that there is a small beer selection, in case you'd like to switch it up. This is a very chilled-out bar and a great place to sample interesting drinks and have a great time. It's not a dance bar, so don't come here expecting to rock your moves out; it's pretty much a speakeasy but at regular bar volumes."}
{"text":"I've never made a review on yelp before but I had to after my experience here at Le Lab. The management went above an beyond to make us feel welcome. The drinks are unique, tasty, and amazing. There is a fun fire show but just watching these bartenders is entertainment enough."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place. My wonderful date took me here and we had a blast challenging niko to create me custom drinks with anything i can think of! First drink: raspberries, elderflowers, sweet yet sour - niko nailed it! I was in heaven sipping the carefully crafted drink. It took him a good 10 mins to make it, sneaking in little shows like flipping bottles and muddling with one a 1 foot muddler. Second drink: no foam, peach, rounded glass, also sweet yet soury. Nailed it again. I called this drink 'le suzana'. Topped it off with a burning sugar cube. 

Cool stuff: it's like a vintage bar with magic potions and syrups. They take care to custom craft the drinks, and their menu apparently has editions, so they are always mixing it up. We were on menu 17 at the time!

They also teach bartending here, so these peeps know their stuff! 

They speak france french... which is... 

Music was a tad bit too loud, and peeps were a tad bit too young, but it's one of my top 3 bars in montreal for sure!"}
{"text":"So so so impressed with le lab. Drinks were incredible. I was there with a party of five, and we each got two rounds of signature cocktails, so We tried ten drinks in total and didn't find one that wasn't well made and incredible. What made the place the best though was the service. Our waitress was amazing, prompt, and came over and invited us to come do flaming shots at the bar with roughly 20 other patrons. So fun, great pictures came out of that. 100% recommend for cocktails and a great time."}
{"text":"Excellent drinks, great service, and a cool atmosphere. We visited on our last night in Montreal in mid October and had an early flight, so we only had a couple drinks. I started with the Jerky Lab Jack, which involved a tiny clothes line, fire, beef jerky, Jack Daniels, some kind of BBQ essence, more fire, and pizzaz. Tony, the bartender was very nice and we were able to chat for a bit as it was a slow Sunday night. 

We had a few other drinks, of which I don't remember the names...because as I said, we had a few other drinks. All were good and unique. Tony also worked on a new drink, trying to find a new drink of the month, he let us try. All in all, a fun experience on our final evening and I would return on a busier night for some more drinks!"}
{"text":"NOT the best cocktails
We were warned, went anyway*
It was a mistake

*literally in our Airbnb there was a note that said, \"Le Lab- avoid-overpriced\" but with all these stellar reviews and a love of cocktails, we went and, wow it was not good. The service was terrible, considering we were dropping $20 on a drink."}
{"text":"J'adore les cocktails du Lab.
Alors qu'il n'y avait pas vraiment de places ce dernier vendredi soir (je sais, c'est pas une surprise), les cocktails sont vraiment délicieux et bien que je n'y connaisse fichtrement peu de chose en bartending... semblent être fait avec beaucoup d'expertise. J'avoue préférer y aller lorsque c'est un peu moins crowdé, mais en somme j'aime bien cette place.
Prix un peu élevé mais bien justifié dans mon opinion."}
{"text":"Le Lab is one of those fancy cocktail lounges with one of those fancy neon martini glass signs outside. Much like the neon sign, the interior of Le Lab is decorated with a reddish ambience and fancy rustic character. Fancy that.

The slick bartenders can mix up some special cocktails from behind the bar. The 2 cocktails I had there were pretty good - not super good, but still pretty good. 

The one down side is the steep price tag that comes with the cocktail. The size is pretty small compared to most other places with the same price, and I had to really slow drink it just to have enough time to soak in the ambience."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more than 5 stars! The service there is above and beyond and the drinks are just as amazing as the staff. 

I came here twice on my birthday vacation to Montreal and each time it was fantastic. We got there at last call the first time and they were kind enough to still let us come in for a shot and beer. Tony even sang happy birthday to me. We finished our ABC flaming fire shot and said we would be back tomorrow.  

We returned the next evening before our dinner plans. We ended up staying much longer than expected. It was was so hard to leave Jessie and her amazing drinks and personality. She would ask our favorite spirits and make the most delicious and creative drinks I had seen (my bf and I are both bartenders too). Both Tonys were super nice and funny, and they kept us very entertained as well. Taller tony had even remembered my name and it was my birthday from the night before and proceeded to sing happy birthday again. It really made me smile and feel really special. 

I can't thank the staff and their excellent service enough. You guys made my birthday unbelievably special! I can't wait to come back again!!"}
{"text":"Le Lab has the most perfect cocktails That I've ever had in my entire life. Omg yes yes yes I'm happy to be reviewing this place, it was THAT good. The wait service was excellent, the vibe here is loud and crowded yet it was semi romantic semi flirty idk whatever.  the drinks were heavenly hands down I cannot wait to go back to this bar ahhhhh omgggggggg"}
{"text":"The labtenders are exceptionally trained mixologists who can curate the perfect drink for your palate. We went for just one drink and ended up having three each! The vibe is chill and we really enjoyed the live dj. We were seamlessly transferred from one server to another as his shift ended and loved them both. Thank you Cami!"}
{"text":"This joint has all the ingredients, all the trimming, all the possibility to be a top notch spot for imbibing however, like a good cocktail the execution and careful measurement are absolute requirements to ensure precise flavor control and a delicious final result. 

Le Lab has an amazing selection of bitters, home made and bought, infusions and a decent selection of booze. I found myself wondering why they needed to serve Jack Daniels when behind those bottles were far more interesting bourbons? Then it dawned on me, this place is trying to be everything to everyone instead of drawing a line in the sand and standing by only top notch ingredients. 

I had the cocktail a la Louisiana, an old school drink that I'm very familiar with. Too sweet and too heavy handed on the absinthe, and don't get me wrong, I like my absinthe, but I like my cocktail to have balance. My wife had a tall glass full of mint leaves and some overly sweet swill. Our compatriots Talisker came with cold water for dilution out of an ice melt absinthe drip fountain. The water was sweetened. 

I watched our very congenial bar tender mix drinks and realized he wasn't measuring his citrus, bitters or sweeteners, that's right, long pours and eye balling them. The only thing measured was booze. HOLY CAW! Where's the quality control?!

In the end this is a great little bar if you roll in with bales of cash. Cocktails run as high as 29 each, sharable ones in the 40s. The soundtrack, a weird melange of 80s and early 90s, leaves you wanting a little Kruder and Dorfmeister, and the drinks are so sweet you think that Willy Wonka is behind the counter. Everyone there was perfectly friendly, but the construction, the measurement, the execution needs a serious rethinking."}
{"text":"Je connaissais le Lab rue Rachel, j'adorais la place et l'ambiance mais je n'aimais qu'un cocktail de la carte vu que tous les autres étaient aux saveurs d'anis ou concombre, bref, tout cela n'est qu'un mauvais souvenir. Redécouverte rue Ste Catherine, un bar plus grand, tout aussi chaleureux, avec un serveur plutôt mignon, toujours de l'absinthe pour ceux qui aiment, mais encore et surtout des cocktails hallucinants!! J'ai craqué presque au hasard sur le \"sex on la beach\" et c'était comme un pêché! 
Entrez dans le pêché vous aussi, brebis égarées, suivez la lumière du Lab, vous êtes déjà pardonné ;)"}
{"text":"This is a very cool spot.  Neat atmosphere.  Extensive list of speakeasy-type cocktails."}
{"text":"Love Le Lab!  We arrived in Montreal on a Sunday evening during Happy Hour, so the bar was fairly empty when we arrived, and about half full when we left.  We enjoyed some great cocktails in a dimly lit, fun, and inviting atmosphere.  The bartenders were friendly and courteous, one even stopped to take a picture for us tourists.

During happy hour, a select variety of drinks are only $8/each.  My first (and only) happy hour cocktail was the Bernardino Sour, with Disarronno, Lavender, and egg white.  Happy Hour was, indeed, happy.

The rest of the cocktails are typical \"cocktail bar\" prices, $10-14/drink.  The chalkboard menu was a little difficult to decipher, as we are non-French speakers, so some ingredients were a bit puzzling.  The printed menu had both English and French descriptions.  

Tuesday night is Tiki Night!  Their regular cocktail menu is a comprehensive list of drinks:  rum, gin, tequila, bowls to share, and shots.  On Tuesdays, there is a menu of 5-6 different tiki-themed cocktails as well, one an homage to Hemingway.  But is there a cocktail bar these days that doesn't tip its hat to at least one writer?  The Hemingway's Secret is meant to be served punchbowl-style for a group of people, but the bartender kindly offered to make a single drink for me.  The mojitos are good here too.

I raised an eyebrow at the \"Apple Crumble\" shot - with roasted marshmallows.  You'll get a shot glass concoction, they light it on fire, you toast your mini marshmallows over the drink, then you you drink it up FAST (through a straw), and proceed to cough like a dragon with bronchitis.

Those shots were an interesting experience, but they scorched my throat and left me sore through the next morning.  Don't do more than ONE of these."}
{"text":"What a fantastic bar! I had the \"Lemon is the Sky\" recommended by the bartender as her favorite drink and it was incredible. Tasted like I was drinking a lemon meringue pie. The bar was just dark enough, the music was just loud enough, the service was just attentive enough; truly a great experience for a unique late night cocktail."}
{"text":"LOVE this bar. It is so much more than a bar. It's a experience. If you appreciate the art of a cocktail and want to admire it without feeling like you're surrounded by hipsters or people that are trying way too hard, go to Le Lab. It was like walking into a time machine as soon as I stepped across the threshold. I got to see the bartender spitfire and it was awesome. If and when I return to Montreal, this will definitely be a place I go back to."}
{"text":"Great cocktails, awesome ambiance, nice dark speakeasy feel."}
{"text":"If you have a toothache, forget the coedine this is better. Truly a speakeasy feel and lots of fiery drinks. All fresh and house made mixers. You will get a show. Awesome music."}
{"text":"I was in Montreal on vacation and visited this place on my last night.  It was the best bar I went to (out of about 10) during my 5 day trip.  Bottom line is that if you like cocktails, you'll love this place.  

Even if you're not into cocktails, the drinks here are so good, and so imaginative, I think you'll like this place anyway.  It should almost be a tourist attraction, and a top 10 one at that.  Check it out.  It's about a 10 block walk from the metro, so you may want to bike here.  

PS - I had about 4 drinks...they were all great, but the Jerky Jack Lab was really a standout.  BBQ, Jack Daniels and beef jerky - it's better than it sounds and that drink alone is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Shared the duck poutine, chorizo, and gnocchi. My friends absolutely loved the duck poutine and gnocchi but didn't like the chorizo. I personally thought that they were all delightful (although poutine and ghocchi were definitely better).

-Pretty trendy place; might be hard to get a table here as it seems to get crowded
-Tried a bunch of drinks, they were tasty but not sure how much alcohol was in them
-One of the waitresses was excellent; the other one was super rude to use once she realized we didn't speak french..."}
{"text":"This bar has a nice layout and appearance.  It's a classic mixology bar geared toward people who want to try whimsical cocktails.  My friends and I sat at the bar (as opposed to a table) on a Saturday night.  The bar is the best location to see the bottle twirling, drink mixing, and fire breathing.  Personally, none of the cocktails were of interest to me, so I ordered a scotch.  It took 25 minutes for a bartender to approach me, even after the rest of my group had been served.  I ordered a Laphroaig, which was listed as a special on the big blackboard above the bar.  They poured literally the smallest serving of scotch I've ever had poured for me in my life and charged me $2 more than the price listed on the board.  When I inquired as to why the price was higher than the listed price, the bartender explained that he gave me a larger serving.  What a waste.  Don't bother ordering anything but the cocktails.  If you're a tourist, and don't mind paying extra for the experience of a bar with less common cocktails, this may be a good option for you.  I enjoyed myself because I was in good company, but this wasn't really my taste."}
{"text":"Excellent bar, good place for groups or just enjoy variety of cocktails. The bar tenders are knowledgeable and ready to whip up something special to fit your special needs. The decor is good, and the atmosphere are good as well."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. The food was ok and the drink collection was nice. The best thing about the experience was that we didn't have yell to hear each other. It's a lovely local place."}
{"text":"A mind blowing experience!!! The unique cocktail bar. They nailed the art of bartending with the fire and Ice show, along with a wide range of innovative cocktails. The prices of cocktails are a lil more than anywhere else, but the rare combination of cocktails, unique taste makes it totally worth. It is a perfect place for a romantic date."}
{"text":"It pains me greatly to give this bar 2 stars, but wow, the service was terrible. 

Let's start with what was great. This place has an incredible drink menu, filled with unique, complex, creative cocktails. Very speakeasy vibe. The drinks were on the pricier side, which makes sense given the ingredients and sophistication of each cocktail, but it is worth noting. The decor is also quite lovely, continuing with the prohibition/speakeasy ambiance. Even their menus nailed \"the look\" and were beautiful to peruse.

Our problem arose with getting service. When we entered the bar, we were patrons #8 and #9. There was virtually no one there. We became the fifth and sixth person at the bar, with three people in a booth near the front. We got our first round of cocktails immediately. Great.

We wanted to order some food. We were informed the kitchen was closed but we could offer something from their late night snack menu. Just getting that information and the the subsequent delivery of said menu took 20 minutes. 

When we had settled on what we wanted to order, we asked the guy who gave us the menu if we could place our order. He said orders could only be placed with the bartender. Apparently this guy we were talking to was a greeter/water delivery person only? OK, fine, we could order from the bartender; we needed another round of drinks anyway. Only problem is the bartender just could not manage to get over to us. Probably because another table of four had sat down and each person had ordered one of their wildly complex cocktails. And yet the bar was, no lie, 10% full. How is this business scalable?

Here's the thing about awesome, competition-winning cocktails: You can't have only one person in the entire joint who can make them. And you also can't have this person be the only person who can type a food order into the computer screen.

I would love to come here again next time I'm in Montreal, but I just cannot imagine spending that much time awaiting service. Sorry guys, only come here if you've got time to blow. And maybe your own hip flask."}
{"text":"Eureka!!! Probably the best cocktail bars in Montreal and arguably Canada.  The bartenders here are PhDs in their art.  True bartending has lost its way but the lab has meticulously revived it like Dr. Frankenstein's monster.  The selection and vast array of liquors opens up the menu to a cornucopia of options.  They will design drinks to your specifications and entertain you with witty stories and the history of their trade.  Next time you're in la belle province you must stop at Le Lab!"}
{"text":"A bit of a trek to get to. The drinks were unique and interesting, things you couldn't get at your normal run of the mill bar and they have Jenga. Reminds me of speakeasys in the States, but much bigger inside and less pretentious."}
{"text":"Went to this bar with friends for some drinks. I liked their cocktails but my friends didn't really enjoy their drinks. Staff was quite friendly as well. What I didn't like was that they took a long time to serve us the drinks every time we ordered, even though the place was not packed."}
{"text":"5 stars on the ambiance and options for drinks. 1 star for service.

We really wanted to love this place. It had everything going for it - ambiance (fun old timely type music) plus an array of wonderfully creative cocktails. The downside? Lack of service. We were only able to order one drink and then our waitress went completely missing in action. The drinks we ordered (one was a maple old fashioned, the other was also a slight twist on an old fashioned but forgot the name) and the good thing is that they were all great. It's just a shame that we only had the chance to enjoy one drink due to service. 

Granted it did get busy (was a Friday night) but the table next to us had to chase the same waitress down to pay their bill, and we eventually had to do the same, waiting about 25 minutes after we flagged her to give us the check. The truth is we had planned on enjoying several drinks, but with such poor service we couldn't justify spending anymore time nor money. My advice to the owner is get more service help otherwise you're likely to miss out on more $$$ from consumers who actually want to give you money.

In short: if you don't want to have bad service sitting at the bar will likely do you wonders."}
{"text":"This is a cool spot with a friendly bartender who not only makes some fine cocktails but also aims to entertain you with his juggling skills. That skill is a part of the act here. 

We came at about 6:00 pm on a Wednesday. I think they had just opened as the place was empty. The set-up has an old school feel but it's modern. We sat at the bar for a while watched the bartender juggle cocktail shakers, then bring one of them around this back and walk it along his shoulder. Pretty cool trick I must say. He told us they have shows some nights where all the bartenders would be doing this kind of stuff and they get so packed that they have to lock the door. Intriguing!

As I was going through the drinking menu, I noticed how much detail they put on there. Not only did they put on the ingredients for each drink, but they also had a phrase or two behind the inspiration of that drink along with a small drawing of the glass it would be served in. 

I settled for the De La Louisiane - an excellent concoction of bitters, absinthe, red vermouth, herbal liqueur and rye which was referenced in some 1937 drink mix book in New Orleans.  My wife got the Japanese Gimlet#2 which was a light, refreshing drink with sake, grey goose and basil.  I wouldn't hesitate recommending either one of those depending on your mood. Also refreshing and equally tasty was the Fleur de Lys but it had maple vanilla listed as one of the ingredients and I told the bartender that I didn't want the drink to be sweet. He added very little and so my drink wasn't sweet at all.

I came to Montreal and found a little bit of NY in Le lab. It wouldn't be out of place at all if it were located somewhere in the West Village. The bartender told us the cocktail scene in Montreal hadn't really taken off yet but if more places like Le Lab pop up, it won't be too long till it does."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a Tuesday night and there were some people but it wasn't super crowded. The bartenders were very welcoming and immediately started us off with some water and were very patient with how indecisive we were. After my first drink, I told them about how I had recently tried Chartreuse and really liked it. The bartenders got really excited and told me they can make a cocktail with it in it even thought there wasn't one on the menu. I told them what I liked and they thought of many different cocktails and seemed genuinely excited with experimenting and making new drinks! I also asked them about some bottles of alcohol I had never seen before at their bar and they gave me a sip of each and explained what everything was! I had such a fun time here and would definitely come back the next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"They just opened three days ago. It's the first time I've been in the Lab. They offer more than 1000 cocktails according to the waitress.
I was impressed first by the beaker on the bar. I haven't seen one in years since my high school. Real thing, like in the chem lab.  I thought those are for decor but the drink we ordered required the beaker instead of the shaker. i had a Japanese sake martini and my husband had a dry martini.
I love the design of their menu and the background music. Everything was just perfect. 
They have a huge selection of cocktail. Can't decide which one to have? Just describe what base you like and what tone you may want. The bartender will have something for you. 
Our bartender Tony was amazing. He really got some techniques for the drink. He is so cool. Will come again

The most important thing they own a Pokemon Gym."}
{"text":"I have to say the drinks are really good, but the service was terrible (it could have been a new waitress, but still...).  It took at least 30-40 mins before someone came to take our order.  We never got refills on water; yes I know it's a bar but when the glasses are empty, there's a problem."}
{"text":"Visited Montreal for my brothers bachelor party and tried this place out the first night. Let's just say that my brother never drinks because he doesn't like alcohol and after the first night we were here every night before going out because of him. The drinks are amazing and the bartenders definitely know how to put on a show for you. From juggling to setting stuff on fire, if you can get there early definitely sit at the bar and you won't want to leave. The have all types of cocktails from shots that put hair on your chest to ones that make you feel like your laying out on a tropical beach. We sat at the bar almost every night and made good friends with the bartender and she was great. I believe her name was asilex. She gave us a couple of rounds of free shots and you could tell through conversation and the way she worked that she had a great passion for her work, which is very rare to see and great too. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the one night that we sat at the table the service was pretty slow. A little understandable because the place gets very packed but I felt they could maybe limit the amount of people inside. Otherwise, the place was phenomenal and we left there every night walking sideways."}
{"text":"Bar à cocktails situé dans le plateau. De l'extérieur on ne voit pas grand chose étant donné que des rideaux masquent fenêtres et portes. L'endroit pourrait sembler calme mais c'est tout le contraire. Nous y sommes allés un samedi vers 23h30 et c'était bien rempli. Il n'y avait plus de tables de disponibles, ni de chaises au bar. Il a fallu attendre debout près du comptoir, toutefois l'hôtesse est venu à deux reprises nous voir afin de nous indiquer que cela ne serait pas long et en effet 10 minutes plus tard nous étions assis. L'endroit est très somber, la musique forte mais cela fait parti de l'ambiance. Le bar est spectaculaire avec un nombre impressionnant d'alcool. J'ai bien aimé la décoration avec les banquettes larges, la tapisserie, bel endroit pour sortir en amis et en groupe, mais un peu trop bruyant pour un rendez-vous. Le menu de cocktails est diversifié, j'ai pris le cocktail avec de la lavande que je recommande fortement. Plusieurs personnes ont pris le même. Chaque boisson est servi dans un verre particulier, il y en a même un dans une boîte de nouilles pour emporter, très impressionnant. 
Petit point negative, lorsqu'on nous a servi, aucun serveur n'est revenu nous voir, nous souhaitions consommer encore et malheureusement aucun serveur n'était disponible. Donc ils ont perdu une vente. Aussi, une table s'est libérée à côté de nous, les clients ont laissé 4 shooters non entamés. Les deux serveurs se sont rués dessus en criant c'est pour nous et en les buvant dans la salle. Totalement inaproprié de la part des employés! Ils auraient du les prendre discrètement à l'arrière et encore là si les clients avaient mis quelque chose dans les verres, c'est à leur risque!!"}
{"text":"this may be the best bar on the planet earth...jessie took such such good care of us, recommending great cocktails and letting us try a bunch of stuff...we had grignotines, and they were great as well. you need to get to this bar NOW !"}
{"text":"Juggling, classy bartenders, FIRE... this place has everything that a bar should. 

Went for a Yelp event so I may be slightly biased, but the whole experience was phenomenal. From the moment you step through that velvety red curtain, you feel like all time outside this bar has stopped, and the only thing that matters is what's happening inside . We had a signature (tropical) cocktail, and partook in their infamous punch bowl - fortunately, it was a Hawaiian themed event so getting loose was a prerequisite - which is actually a year round beverage option. Because who doesn't love sangria in the dead of winter?! After looking at the menu, I'd say this is probably not the place where Joe Average would become a regular (drinks are pretty pricey), but it's dolphinitely the kind of place that I could see myself coming for a drink or two (or three). 


Oh, and I also have to give them bonus points for their dazzling internet videos. If you haven't seem them, go check 'em out. It'll give you a good sense of what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"This place has a \"speakeasy\" vibe.  Once behind the curtain, you enter a cool hib vibe. Bartenders are super friendly and accommodating.  We got a couple of drinks that were delicious. I had one with ginger beer and grapefruit and the hubby had the beef jerky whisky that was served in a cool way.  Behind the bar, there are lots of bitters (that they also sell) and lots of cool ingredients.  If it's not too busy, some of the bartenders juggle bottles and keep you entertained.  If you are really lame and need WIFI, they offer it for free! (We needed it to get directions to dinner)"}
{"text":"The cocktails here are quite good and fairly strong so you get your money's worth.  I also like the atmosphere in the bar.  TThe only complaint I have is that they didn't keep track of our tabs very well and charged us for drinks we didn't order."}
{"text":"Best bar in Montreal in terms of cocktail selection. 
The staff is very friendly on weekdays with fewer people at the bar. 

Tip: Try the fire shots for a thrill in winter."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this bar, almost as much as I loved the drink I had there. The bartenders were very friendly and helped me select a cocktail based on my preferences. The drink has complex flavors and was so delicious. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Bonne place pour les cocktails! Beaucoup de choix et les barman se feront un plaisir de vous conseiller!"}
{"text":"Très chouette bar à quelques minutes de la station Berry UQUAM. L'endroit est grand avec une ambiance tamisée et une décoration chaleureuse. On y trouve un large choix de cocktails à des prix corrects, et des cocktails assez originaux (avec un sirop goût sauce BBQ, avec du cacao,...), mais aussi des cocktails flambés. On a droit également  à un verre d'eau fraîche aux concombres qu'un(e) serveur(euse) rempli régulièrement et qui fait du bien entre chaque verre d'alcool. Des musiciens, un chanteur sont aussi présents pour animer la soirée. Bref, une bonne découverte que ce bar !"}
{"text":"Le Lab was on my bar bucket list and I can say that my life is now complete. Once you push the red curtains guarding the entrance aside and walk into the bar you're immediately transported to another era. Dim red lights are illuminating this Moulin Rouge-like bar, the bartenders are taking shots while playing with fire, and the brouhaha is pouring into your ears - what a time to be alive.

Once seated, the menu was handed to us along with a glass of water. Exactly what we needed since Le Lab was our third bar stop and dehydration from the alcohol was kicking in? Anyways, my pick was the Tiger Thai Collins which was probably the best cocktail I've ever had. The coconut added a creamy richness, the lime gave the drink a citrus zing, and finally, the hot pepper delivered the knockout punch into heaven. It was so good that I wanted to try other drinks but it was time for our next bar stop.

Expertly well thought drinks accompanied with crazy butt clenching pyromaniac stunts, a definite return. Truly a must try bar if you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"Pour les amateurs de cocktails, c'est la place ! Belle ambiance feutrée !"}
{"text":"Cocktails are not only about the booze and the mixing, which Le Lab have down pat.  What they lack is atmosphere, I've always felt this place could be spruced up a little into a cozier place.

The menu is absolutely overwhelming, keeping you second-guessing on your choice but all the drinks turn out very good.

I would go back but I would not bring a first-date there."}
{"text":"Le nombre de bouteille derrière le comptoir montre que les gars savent de quoi ils parlent. 
Mon premier choix s'est dirigé sur le Jerky Lab Jack, mêlant Whisky et Jerky Beef, avec un morceau suspendu par une corde au-dessus, entre mignon et viril :) Le bartender m'a ensuite proposé un Bourbon sour avec un sirop de framboise, une fois de plus aussi manly que girly. 
J'y retourne des que possible."}
{"text":"If you want a pretty and delicious cocktail served to you by one of their friendly Lab staff, then I would suggest you bookmark this place. Okay, let's start with their decor, it's not too much and not too little, I would even say cool. Definitely, gives you an impression that it's a serious cocktail establishment. It is a little bit small so it may not be the place to bring a group of 15 people or more.  I  really like how creative they get with the drinks, my Sex on la beach came in a \"plastic\" looking cup, topped with a flower and a cute card. Maybe I just like pretty cocktails, but it did tasted delicious. There is also, some kind of drink show going at the bar, flaming shots and all. Overall, it's a nice place to have an after or before dinner drinks or even bring the date."}
{"text":"Really great bar. Favorite was the Peat Martini super smooth and also the tonic they use for their gin and tonics is incredible. They make the syrup themselves it has spices and herbs infused in it with orange and cloves hands down incredible. Waitress was super friendly and at tentative even though it was a Saturday night and super packed. Really fun spot for a group of friends not a chill spot more like hangout cocktail hour. The drink menu is extensive and what's even more impressive is how's it's divided up very unpretentious and a good time..."}
{"text":"Wow. This is worth the trip just to watch the bartenders whip up some of the best cocktails in Montreal. Don't miss it. Hint: go for the \"The Sky is a Lemon\"."}
{"text":"Incredible cocktails (the Shelby and chupacabra were amazing) and you can't miss out on the campfire shot (lit up to roast marshmallows). Definitely a must-do in Montreal"}
{"text":"Very cool place. I came on a weekday night, and it was very quiet. However, the bartenders were super-friendly, and we had a great chat. The cocktails were outstanding - very tasty, and the bartenders definitely knew what they were doing.  The only downside was the price - $15-25 cocktails was a bit steep. Still, I would come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Le Lab is so enjoyable! A lounge like vibe! 

Love everything here! The cocktails here are all well crafted and balanced! The bartenders having so much fun lighting up everything in flames! What a show!

Service though a little slow in the beginning but did pick up. We tried:

Jerky Jack Lab ($14)
- Spicy Beef Jerky, Homemade BBQ Bitter and Whiskey
- A drink that can be eat like a snack?!Smokey but sweet and spicy at the same time!

Blazer Bastard ($14)
- Ginger Syrup and Brandy served warm! Great to drive away the cold snowy weather during winter

Zombie 1956 ($28)
- A mixture of over 10 elements and the drink is just so well balanced! So refreshing!

Le Royal ($13)
- my Yelp friend seemed to enjoy that very much

Lost Island ($13)
- This is the only cocktails that I didn't enjoy, I have to agreed with my fellow yelper that it did taste like burnt tires

The drinks here are priced reasonably and the combination is just so unique! There are just so many I want to try and of course it is worth a repeat visit next time I am in town!

Menu changed seasonal and there are also some off the menu items on the chalkboard.

If you not sure of what to drink, make sure you talk the the experienced bartenders! And if possible sit at the bar and watch the flaming show!"}
{"text":"Si vous vous sentez d'humeur à de nouvelles expériences, c est la place.

Des cocktails orignaux auxquels même les esprits les plus fou n aurait pas pensé!

Des mélanges incroyable qui se mari avec harmonie dans votre bouche. 

Si vous êtes d'humeur aux découvertes gustatives un soir, rendez-vous là bas pour un ou deux ( trois, quarte, cinq, etc...) verres pour pimenter une journée un peu morose!"}
{"text":"Outstanding place! Staff are entertaining and highly skilled! Antoiine really knows his stuff, and can whip up any cocktail based on your preferences! Do not visit Montreal without heading here!"}
{"text":"When I find a screw (literally a screw) in my food - and then you offer me a shot and don't comp the goat cheese app I found the screw in...hmmmm"}
{"text":"Drinks are an art form at Le Lab. The mixologists are extremely talented and know exactly what to mix together (and what not to).

The drink menu is vast. You can also ask them to whip up something based on your tastes, but I find sometimes that can be a little overwhelming. 

I started with a Mai Tai (not your traditional overly sweet kind, but mixed with all the right juices and liquor) and the 1848 (definitely a heavy ginger taste, beware). 

Reservations are a must (even for the bar) or you'll be standing. Drinks are pricey, pace yourself."}
{"text":"let me tell ya.. this place was ALL i could talk about after my trip to Montreal.  everybody i've talked to, i always had to briefly mention Le Lab to introduce this place to all my friends.

The drinks were amazing! strong and to the point! great selection on the menu and such amusing descriptions!  and get this... a WHOLE page menu for shots with FLAMES! oh.em.gee.  i know.. i am a huge sucker for novelty... but really, who wouldn't want a little spark on their drink??! i think you have to sit at the bar for this but the presentation is sooo intriguing! i was mesmerized by all the bartenders' tricks! lol 

really fun lounge to chill at~ everybody looked like they were having a good time.  but you HAVE to claim your spot early on the night especially on the weekends.  the place isn't huge and sometimes you might even have to get cozy with your neighbors.  i still recommend visiting this place when you're in town~ can't wait to return!! :)"}
{"text":"Yes it is not cheap. Yes you have so much cool drinks to select so you will always wonder if you chose the right one but that is it it a place were you pay to get the best quality liqueur (and you do) to get a very interesting and tasty cocktails (and you do)  and you pay for a unique experience (and you get it). Where else would you see barmen dressed in an old European way mixing amazing drinks and making you alcohol taste buds reach multiple Orgasm's?  The answer is here so what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"My wife and I are from NY and came here on our 9th anniversary. Best bartenders we have ever seen. They check every glass for imperfections and decant a bit to check for proper flavor before serving to the customers. Our bartender Niko was very professional and friendly. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others. We wish more bartenders took this much pride in their craft."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. I looooove this place!!

Amazing cocktails, first and foremost. That's what you go to the Lab. You don't go there to order a vodka-cranberry or a beer. You go there for the specialty cocktails prepared expertly by skilled mixologists using great liquors and ingredients.

Service is superb. You can order from the cocktail menu, or if you feel adventurous, you can provide some guidelines and they'll mix something up for you. For instance I'm a big mezcal lover and there were no mezcal cocktails in the menu. They proposed something mixed with scotch and it was fantastic!

Food is secondary there, small bites, but it taste good and can ensure you don't get drunk too fast.

Will I be back? Of course. I've already been back already multiple times."}
{"text":"A unique bar with great drinks, good music and friendly service. 

If you go before 8:00 any day you can get the cocktails which are regularly $12 for only $8. Most of their cocktails run for $15.  We saw a $85 drink that serves 6-8 people. What a fun idea for a birthday or other celebration! Their drink menu changes twice a year, one menu for Spring and Summer and then another for Fall/Winter etc. They have a small selection of food as well. 

It surprisingly not busy for how consisitently good it is.  It's quite dark, so I would recommend it for a cold or gloomy day."}
{"text":"Je n'étais pas allée au Lab depuis un bon bout de temps et j'étais bien contente de célébrer la belle journée ensoleillée d'hier avec un 77 Sunset Strip. Ananas, rhum, vodka, gin, lime, citron, pomme de grande... un vrai party luau pour mes papilles!

On dirait bien que la thématique du moment est les îles tropicales (style Hawaï) et c'était reflété dans le décor, les cocktails aux menus, et surtout les concoctions spéciales créée que pour ce moment de soleil. Ça a eu comme effet de me faire dire \"J'irais bien à Hawaï\" au moins deux ou trois fois en l'espace d'une heure!

J'ai terminé la soirée avec un cocktail non-alcoolisé (un espèce de pina colada) qui était surprenant, délicieux, et même remplissant! Il était tellement savoureux que ça me donne le  goût de devenir conductrice designee plus souvent, tant que la soirée se passé à Le Lab."}
{"text":"What a great late night spot! We went during off-ish hours (Sunday at 10pm) as a pre-poutine night stop and Le lab stole the thunder for the evening! Perfect mix of well thought out and delicious drinks, creative and informative menu, and uniquely warm setting. Locals enthusiastic about the drinks, college kids looking for a social experience beyond the books, and young local lovers, visitors, and a mix of others shaking up the milieu even at this strange time. We tried the Beside the car (great ginger notes) and the traditional absinth service (each about $13 CAD)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Went with my friend to this place and we loved it! I order a crazy ass whiskey cocktail that came with beef jerky (it came on a weird little contraption that seemed like a miniature clothesline with moving parts and everything)and it accentuated and complemented the cocktail's flavors. I will definitely be coming back here to take pictures. Service is average, and the prices might seem high but the quality of the cocktails will more than make up for that fact."}
{"text":"What a great bar in Montreal. We came here on a Sunday night for a few drinks and it was well worth the visit. On a Sunday night it was very easy to get a seat and have a good conversation. The menu is huge with a lot of unique mix drinks. 

Drinks:
- Jerky Lab Jack which definitely hit the smokey and woody pallet
- Paradise non alcoholic which was refreshing and quenching

Likes:
- atmosphere 
- service 
- selection of beverages
- location, directly across from the park

Dislikes:
- prices

Overall I would come back again!!!!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this cocktail bar. 

Cocktails - Outstanding! The innovation behind each and every cocktail just simply portrays the genius mind of those who works at le LAB.  The staff is challenged to create upon one specific ingredient every month, as they commonly name \"the prescription of the month\". Whether you want to take on revisited oldies or you want to go out of the ordinary with their Jerky Lab Jack (Daniel's, Cointreau, and a slice of smoky beef jerky), Le Lab is the place to be. You're an indecisive person? Well rest assured! Go with a \"impress me\" or a \"make me a drink\" [don't forget \"please\"], and let them do their magic.  
 
Staff - Exceptional! Also known as \"Labtenders\", they are challenge-thrived creationist whose prime endeavors are to... please you and offer you the fittest cocktail for your taste buds! They are always up to a friendly conversation and are exceptionally knowledgeable. They are not barmen, rather mixologists ! 

Ambiance - old jazzy-acoustic music playing in the background, massive wooden bar, and the place has the reminiscence of 60-70's cocktail lounge (at least to my opinion). The music is just enough loud to be heard, beautifully tuned so that you can speak without shouting. And on Fridays and Saturdays, they display amazing flair with fired joggling bottles along with some fire breathing! Definitely something you don't want to miss."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, friendly and knowledgeable server, and great drinks. Loved the drink menu - had detailed descriptions and historical facts to go with the drink's story. Fun!
Seems like a good place to come with a group, but difficult to converse with other patrons. Everyone is already there with someone and the layout of seating makes it difficult to interact with others. The bar is very limited in its space and we were ignored by the bartenders (busy making drinks - but could've paused to greet us) so we sat down after a few minutes of aimlessly standing around.
Bonus is getting their house cucumber water!"}
{"text":"This place is lit. Literally. Lots and lots of flaming drinks are available for your pleasure, if that's what you're into.*

I am not super into flaming things, unless I'm sharing a tiki bowl, so I went for a smoky manhattan. Pretty much everyone else at the table ordered different concoctions, and they were all delicious. One of them was a snifter where you inhaled warm banana steam before drinking the shot. What. I don't actually understand that much about mixology, but I know this place takes it seriously without being too pretentious. 

Reservations are recommended. 

Long live Le Lab!

{"text":"I've been there many times and have been continuously impressed by their creativity and passion for mixology! And everytime, I make sure to tell them what I like and what I don't so they can custom make me a drink! And they can really work with anything! If you are feeling adventurous, bring yourself an ingredient and challenge them to make you a drink! I brought durian essence and they miraculously made a phenomenal drink with it! It is seriously impressive! All of their staff is knowledgeable and non-pretentious! Couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal, we definitely wanted to visit  Le Lab. Did not disappoint! The decor was beautiful and ambience was super chill. The drink menu is extensive, overwhelming yet wonderful. 

I'm a huge fan of \"tiki\" drinks. So my friend and I split the smaller tiki drink, The Beach Comber. It was exactly what the description had described... fruity, complex & strong. Although the prices are higher than other bars, it worth the premium & hype. The quality shows through. Definitely on my list when I return to the city!"}
{"text":"Service attentioné , jolie place pour se saouler avec originalité , surtout les jours d'hiver ou de pluie puisque aucune fenetre sur place donc vous allez oublier la meteo qui vous attend dehors. Grande varieté de drinks à decouvrir."}
{"text":"During my recent travels to Montreal this place definitely wins for best bar.  The cocktails were exceptional, and it was a real delight to see that the mixologists are so passionate about what they do.  Absolutely worth a visit!  If possible - sit at the bar and ask questions."}
{"text":"I love cocktails, and believe that we need a place that caters to what I see as a lost art.  Food is great and all the new styles of prep are fun and diverse, but when it comes to the drinks, they are few and far in between.
Lab does just that, they are very well versed in the standards, and are very good at coming up with new customized ones as well. The staff is friendly and fun to watch as they dazzle you with there \"bar flair\", and are also willing to help you learn about the various potions they can create.

Let's face it we can all use something different and these modern day apothecaries bring it and can make something for everyone.  

Enjoy"}
