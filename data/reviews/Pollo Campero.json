{"text":"Fried chicken was out of this world!  Juicy yet not overly greasy.  Shredded chicken bowl was flavorful but not too spicy, surprisingly.  Definitely good for those that can't take the heat.  The cashier was great at giving tips for my first time visit, and all employees were bilingual.  This location is clean and well lit at night.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of some of the locations in Miami called Pollo Tropical however if food was very refreshing cooked well and tasted great the only reason I gave it three stars is because the service was ferocious my wife's order was wrong twice I had to argue with cashier because they charged me for one meal and gave her a different one my only reason for the review is to let the owner know got to get the service together man and you'll have it all made"}
{"text":"This is another place down S Blvd. that has potential. It seemed unorganized in the back and some of the workers were laughing loudly and having conversation, which is great...you're having fun, but it's a bit distracting for customers and not always the best interpretation when you're just trying to get chicken in peace. Oh God, I hope somebody doesn't get shit for being happy at work.   The grilled chicken here has an Italian flavored marinade. It tastes exactly how it does when I make baked chicken with an Italian dressing marinade. I don't hate it, just didn't strike me as \"Pollo Compero\". The photos of the food include límon with the chicken, we didn't get any.   Fooled again'd.   Corn salad had more lettuce and tomatoes than corn. We were expecting something more like Mexican street corn salad. Was expecting the cheese to be the crumbly queso, but didn't taste or appear to be that either. Skip. Compero beans are good. The light green sauce that comes with the chicken doesn't make the most sense to me, but might to other people. Just doesn't seem to compliment the chicken.  We got a half chicken and they only gave us two tortillas. :/ Ok.   The tables in the dining room had some with hot sauces and some without, kind of odd.   Heard the rice here is good.   Sweet plantains weren't bad either.  I'll definitely come back, this place just needs some time.  They have a drive-thru, wowowowowow."}
{"text":"OMG Best Chicken Ever!!!  I slept on this spot for nearly a year. Now, I have it for lunch or dinner weekly. Still can't wait to have the Fried Chicken Bowl."}
{"text":"We went here tonight to try this spot out and we loved the food! I got fried chicken which was seasoned well. The other person order bake chicken which was also seasoned well! I will be back! I'm also telling my friends to try this spot out as well."}
{"text":"Mmm this place is good they have the best fried chicken.I had mine with beans,tortillas and Cole slaw.I'd choose pollo campero over any other fast food chicken place. You can tell they don't pump their chicken up with additives and broth n whatever else kfc n those other places do.Its the best,they have lots to choose from....even grilled chicken.if you go you'll like it,simple as that."}
{"text":"This chicken is the best.if you never had it before do so.dont have to wait till I go to Cali for it anymore."}
{"text":"I came and ordered the half chicken special to go. The grilled chicken looked so good that I ordered all grilled chicken instead of the fried chicken and I don't regret my decision at all! The chicken was seasoned so well and the meat was juicy. The order came with two sides and I chose plantains and yuca fries. I ordered an extra side of rice as well. The rice and yuca fries were great! Plantains, eh. I prefer the ones over at Viva but everything else was amazing! Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome and the customer service is great too. I went to pick some lunch up for myself and a friend around 11:00am and there was only one car in front of me in the drive thru. The ladies who helped me were very kind and didn't miss or forget anything. I ordered a two piece fried chicken with yucca fries and the empanada trio with rice. Everything was super tasty. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and it's not that expensive. A different Latin food from Guatemala.. not really spicey."}
{"text":"I tried the fried chicken it was really good didn't care to much for the sides next time im just gonna get the chicken"}
{"text":"The chicken is good but this is the 3rd time it takes an unacceptable amount of time to get my to-go order ready which is why I'm writing this review. The point of ordering online is so that your food is ready when you get there not get there and still wait 20mins for it while other customers who walked in after you get their food before you. On top of that I didn't even get an apology. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pollo Campero will be my \"go to\" restaurant when the normal won't do. I can't tell you how great the flavors are... you will have to find out on your own."}
{"text":"Yes, a vegetarian loves Pollo Campero. It's known for it's fried or grilled chicken and the assortment of the latin sides. The bowls are quite amazing, and they give you a bunch of food for the money. My absolute favorite is the street corn salad (extremely fresh) and the yuca fries. I also like the slaw and fried plantains. But please.. don't forget dessert. The dulce de leche empanada and the flan are wonderful. I don't even like flan, but this is more like a sweet pudding with a lovely dulce de leche sauce in the bottom. Service is immaculate the inside is extremely clean. You don't eat on paper or boxes here, they give you an actual plate. There is an assortment of juices that are also wonderful. This place is super family-friendly and extremely well run. Don't drive by thinking this is just another fast food place or any other Mexican restaurant. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Very busy. They opened early and still a line to the door. The service is ok, but  slow. it was 20 minutes to get to the counter and that was only about 8 people deep. They don't have the grilled chicken or the roasted corn salad, 2 things I was interested in. The fried chicken was juicy and tasty enough.  Chicken empanadas were fine though there wasn't much buffalo flavor in the buffalo version. The Yuca fries were rather heavy and oily.    They are swamped with opening day customers. They have  more than full staffing and the service isn't quite there.  In short. It shows promise, but give it a few weeks for the crowds to die down to see what it will be like normally."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve one star for the awful service I received. Not only was I not greeted, but it took over 30 minutes to get an order of empanadas and camperitos. Not one person apologized for the wait time and the food is mediocre. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to PC.  I've tasted both the fried chicken and the grilled chicken.  The fried chicken is delicious and the grilled chicken is outstanding.  The seasonings on the grilled chicken are gifts from heaven, the chicken is moist and is served with a slice of lime.  The lime juice squeezed on the grilled chicken enhances the chicken even more.  I purchased a 3 piece meal which includes french fries for a little less than $9.  You can't beat the quality and the price.  By far, this is the best chicken I've ever eaten.  I used to buy fried chicken from the one of their competitors but no longer!  This is now the chicken spot for my family."}
{"text":"I had a large order for my work that I called in for lunch . When I went in to pick it up they were busy. When I got to the counter they rang up my orders. I didn't wait very long maybe 5 minutes. But what really got my attention was when they called my name for my orders I went to pick them up at the counter. She asked if I wanted to check and make sure it was all there. I said yes I will take it out in the dining room and check. She said ok I will come with you. She came out with the bags of good and check to make sure every order was there. Wow! You do not see this kind of customer service much anymore. Thank You Lupe (spelling?) for going the extra mile to ensure my order was correct and that I was satisfied! The food was delicious! We will return!"}
{"text":"The grilled chicken and Compero beans are delicious! This is the second time eating here and we are very satisfied with the food. They didn't have any more breasts at the moment so she gave me two thighs. We will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite spot for grilled chicken BUT good luck getting any. The past 3 or 4 times I've been here they are out of grilled chicken or they no longer make this or that. Soooooo basically you are always out/no longer make the things that I order. Why even bother going anymore?"}
{"text":"Chicken is good but The portion of sides for takeout is laughably small. If I knew I would have asked for more - You're basically paying for overpriced chicken."}
{"text":"Espere más de una hora pero valió la pena porq el pollo estába riquísimo lo único malo que las cajeras son muy lentas y la que me atendió se llamaba Ivette muy pesada la verdad y aparte no tenían tortillas tampoco los camperitos ni las famosas salsas entonces me tuve que comer el puro pollo con papitas pero como dije antes el sabor del pollo es único"}
{"text":"Great chicken! Stopped by today for some lunch with my family. We ordered a 12 piece and fries also ordered the guava drink so bomb. Chicken has a great taste. We will definitely be making this a regular eatery for us!"}
{"text":"The gratest food Place EVER! my parents are born from Guatemala when I visited Guatemala the first place I went to is pollo campero and I told my mom I wish pollo campero was in Phoenix and my wish came true :)"}
{"text":"Las Vegas finally had a Pollo Campero! Waited in line for an hour and it was so worth it!  FOOD: Their fried chicken is amazing. It is fried on a skillet in a lemon based oil. It takes longer to cook than a deep fryer and that is why their chicken is so fresh and delicious. The have many unique sauces, but you must remember to order them or they won't give them to you. Their sides are all delicious and fresh, I like their french fries.  DRINK: They have a few juices that are different every day. If they have Guava juice, you must order it!!!  ATMOSPHERE: It may seem like your average fast food stop, but it is not! DINE-IN!!!!! It's worth it. Everyone is super friendly. The food is served on actual plates and everything is done family style.  HISTORY: Pollo Campero originated in Guatemala and has expanded across the globe."}
{"text":"This place is always fast pretty clean and the food is great for the price. It is similar to Viva Chicken but a lot cheaper. I always get the grilled and fried combo the best of both world's. The grilled chicken has lemon zest spicy and always moist. I tried the empanadas as well which is Hot and Fluffy and pretty medium inside. I got the buffalo sauce little bit too Saucy but still good. Don't know if this is the healthiest options but the grilled chicken and Yuca fries are always my combinations that I go to."}
{"text":"Have only gotten take out but this is the best grilled chicken! Street corn salad and plantains are two delicious sides. Service is fast and order has always been accurate."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken bowl is so freaking good. I've had it 3 times now. Smh it's all I ever want for lunch now. And it's definitely 2 meals... and for $7 you can't beat that."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place as I had seen the reviews and it sounded great!  I ordered the grilled chicken family pack. The chicken was really good. It was moist and tasty. I got two sides with the family pack. Campero beans and corn salad. The corn salad was fair and the beans were good but the container of beans was maybe 1/2 full. The issue I have is the cost of the two sides. $7.00 for two sides - especially when one was only 1/2 full!  I may go back for the chicken but I won't get the sides again!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, I was hoping for a place more like El Pollo Loco in the western states, but it was good"}
{"text":"The grilled chicken is packed with flavor!  The rice and the campero beans were wonderful as well.  The fried chicken was a bit pedestrian, but overall it was a pleasant meal."}
{"text":"Fried chicken was juicy and skin was nice and crispy. My issue was I didn't like how they seasoned the chicken. Possibly could taste better on the grilled variety. Store was clean and staff was friendly. Unfortunately I did not like the flavor of my meal."}
{"text":"We ordered two nights ago because we didn't want to have to brave the snow outside, and I'm so glad we did. The prices were reasonable; we got two Leg & Thigh combos we other beans. The beans were super tasty and had a lot of seasoning; I actually drained the sauce off some and added it to a small salad to spice it up. I've had the empanadas and yuca fries from this place, but never had the actual chicken. They pride themselves on having hormone and antibiotic free chicken, and I definitely believe and appreciate it. The chicken, which we got hand breaded, was absolutely delectable. Lots of flavor, fried lightly, tender, and satisfying. As a cherry on top, they included a personal note, which I highly appreciated. I'll be ordering here again."}
{"text":"We love this place! Like a cheaper version of Viva Chicken, this place is a winner winner, Chicken dinner.   Prices are extremely affordable. Get the corn salad and yuca fries as sides along with tortillas."}
{"text":"I'm seriously in love with this place. We went one night in a whim after a friend recommended it. It was totally worthwhile.   Imagine if Viva Chicken had a baby with Bojangles. Pollo Campero is that delicious, and well-priced, baby. The grilled chicken is great, so is the fried chicken. I always get the grilled corn salad and the yuca fries. Get the green sauce to dip your chicken in. Trust me.   On our most recent visit, I went out on a limb and got the pollo verde empanadas. Delicious.   The service is always fantastic. The employees answer questions, and the food is brought to your table on REAL PLATES (fiesta wear, such a party place!) which is a great touch.   Go here!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is great, the service is fantastic and has a all around wonderful atmosphere. Being our first time here the young man who brought the food to our table asked questions about our preferences and made suggestions for sauces to accompany our meal. They were perfect."}
{"text":"Food was ok, service was terrible I figure by now they would have there stuff together but I guess not smh."}
{"text":"The place has good fried chicken, I like it better than El Pollo Loco. The only problem is the staff some of them look like they don't know what they're doing."}
{"text":"This place different & unique because it's like El Pollo loco mixed with Popeyes without the mild or spicy to choose . From"}
{"text":"Having grown up in Guatemala, Pollo Campero is one of those places that stays close to your heart. I went to Guatemala this last April and my first stop that day was for some fried chicken and i had it a few times thourghout my two week stay. Last week on my way out to Vegas i stopped for some good 'ol fried chicken and the quality and flavor of the chicken compared to the same chicken back in Guatemala was 10x better.  I love this place and will never stop coming here for the most flavorful and crispy and juicy chicken!"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD. first time eating there and my boyfriend & i loved it! the staff & chicken were 10/10 and everything was fresh & hot"}
{"text":"Same as a lot of people here. Drove by and see lines that look as if you were at a theme park. Finally built up enough strength to find out what the fuzz was about.  Walked in, line was only ten people this time so thought \"awesome\"!!!  Went in at 6:05pm finally they took my order at 4:40 and I am not kidding. I was amazed on the customers attitudes though!!  all positive made me think this is gotta be the real McCoys of chicken. Waited for my order!!  7:34pm: I finally got my order. Got home and opened up the box   You know after all the bad service and the price on this chicken, it is just not worth the hustle!!!  I just don't get it and probably will never go there again!!!"}
{"text":"Just about the best chicken I've had in Las Vegas! I definitely recommend this place, and don't forget to try the \"dulce de leche\" empanadas. You'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"The grilled chicken is delicious, the fried chicken is ok. I ordered a side of beans and rice. Rice was bland but I liked the beans. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"YUMMM!! Amazing chicken amazing black beans those were my fav everything else I ate rice brown beans empanadas horchata I think thats it so far it's all good stuff I haven't been in yet only the drive thru so it looks good from the outside. Ill have to try the dining soon I heard it's a cool experience I have to add the grilled chicken in my opinion is the best iv ever had customer service was nice normal drive thru ill be back"}
{"text":"We tried several items and many sides from he menu. The fried chicken is was delicious with the right amount of breading to actually taste the chicken. We tried the coleslaw, rice, fries and yuca fries and all where good with the beans and fries being my favorites.   They are a little unorganized at the counter and some items aren't being served that are in the menu but I'm sure once they get established things will run more smoothly. Overall a great place to get some good chicken!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but good lord, the service is awful. It's as if no one has been trained in any way, shape, or form. There is a swarm of employees but they're inefficient. Drive Thru line wrapped around the lot, went inside to see a line wrapped around the dining room as well.   SERVICE: Apparently a half-hour wait is the norm here. It's unnecessary, given that you can see the food being freshly prepared and waiting to be bagged. The polite lady on register (only two) was not familiar with the menu or the POS system and kept repeatedly looking at a paper menu, the overhead menu, and her screen in confusion. My order was not complicated, but it took five minutes for her to call over the manager, and another five for the manager to figure it out. Both repeatedly tried to upsell me on their featured combo, which had an extra piece of chicken, finally stating they didn't know how to add on the side I wanted without charging full price and the \"feature\" had an extra side included. $10 and change, not bad.  FOOD: Three piece dark (leg/thigh) combo with 2 grilled and one fried, sides of yucca and corn salad, plus an empanada and two sauces (guava and bbq). Sauces were forgotten, but chicken was flavorful enough not to need it. Grilled chicken is juicy and smothered in an herb marinade, but oddly rubbery as if it were steamed or not fully cooked. Fried was better than expected, cooked in a skillet rather than a fryer. Difficult to pick a favorite.  Yucca side was generously portioned but could use a sauce. Corn salad tasted good but was room temperature, unclear whether it's supposed to be heated or cold.  Buffalo empanada exterior was flaky but had an off-putting artificial butter flavor. I liked the filling though, wasn't too spicy.  I realize they're fairly new (open three weeks), but management really needs to step in and train the staff. As they expand and open other locations, they need to learn from this location and make the space larger or at the least plan for a better way to manage the parking lot traffic, as people were unable to back out of their spaces to leave due to the cars in line. I'd like to come back in to enjoy dine-in service, they use real plates and silverware."}
{"text":"Move over other chicken places! This restaurant has some of the best chicken I have had. It is reasonable prices. We have tried the grilled and fried chicken and they are both favorites! Something else I Love is the variety of sides (street corn salad. Yuka fries, plantains, campers beans, rice to name a few, it's much different than most chicken places you would eat at and they have empanadas! The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is the 3 times we have visited their staff are not very engaging or friendly, and the tables are never clean in the dining room. We have to ask for napkins every time to clean our table, the drink station is always a mess as well. If the food was not as good as it was these are things that would make us eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"We were blown away by the food and customer service.  My family of four had an amazing dinner for under $30.  The kids' meals were the right size and the kids loved the chicken.  My wife had a two piece meal with plantains.  I had the fried chicken bowl and the Peruvian verde empanada.  My meal was incredibly flavorful and prepared well.  The sauce which came with the empanada was delicious.  I could eat that with so many things.  The chicken bowl was a great size and really filled me up.  Plenty of cilantro and tasty black beans!  We were greeted warmly upon entering.  The service was prompt and food delivered to the table quickly.  An outstanding meal all around.  I so glad I read about Pollo Campero on yelp.  We will be back many times."}
{"text":"It was my first time, and I was expecting a little bit more from this place. I ordered grilled chicken with one side, a drink and 2 tortillas came with the order), only for $6.  We were 3, but the cashier took wrong one of our orders. We never received the extra side we paid for. My side was coleslaw. It was good. So, I think that for the price, the food was good. But not the customer service. Tables and restrooms can be more clean..."}
{"text":"How is this place getting such low ratings? The chicken is absolutely delicious! I prefer the grilled over the fried. The grilled has a citrus flavor seasoning. So if you're not a fan of citrus - do not get the grilled chicken. They serve their grilled chicken with lime --- and it's the exact goodness you need for amazing flavor!   Not going to lie - the sides here are garbage. Nothing was impressive as far as sides go. Rice was bland. Beans were tasty but salty. Cole slaw was extra runny. Yucca fries were flaky. Regular fries were well done and hard. Corn salad was filled with cheese: too salty for my taste.   Despite the terrible sides....  The chicken alone is well worth the 5 stars."}
{"text":"Pollo Campero is unique in my opinion, another Yelper compared it between Pollo Loco and Popeye's. I think his description was on target.   I ordered the three piece fried leg and thigh meal with Campero Beans and Horchata. It came with corn tortillas and a cold dipping sauce that is somewhat like Thousand Island salad dressing.   The chicken was flavorful and it was completely cooked unlike the odd KFC. Since I had the dipping sauce I gave it a try and it didn't add or take away from the flavor of the chicken. The chicken was a little bit on the oily side, but once I took a bite I forgot about it.   The Campero Beans were out of this world delicious! I only wished they had given me more than two tortillas. It was just like homemade pinto beans and better than Pollo Loco Beans. The horchata was very tasty and it's the type of horchata you get in Los Angeles, very tasty and not watery at all.   The ladies working here were very friendly and attentive, despite me getting stuck while ordering. I really think that their spin on fried chicken with yummy sides, and top notch service is why they're successful. I'm glad to have them in North Las Vegas. My overall rating on the chicken is an 8. It's not quite PL, but, it's better than KFC."}
{"text":"Pollo Campero reminds me of a Spanish bojangles.  Chicken, sides & tortillas.  I saw tons of reviews about the fried chicken, but in my opinion the citrus grilled chicken is where it's at.  It's so juicy, with almost a blackenkng seasoning and a flare of lime juice.  The corn salad is really good, it's light and refreshing and crisp.  The only other side I had was the Spanish rice and it was good too.    The staff is friendly. The service is quick. Their prices are reasonable and the food is yummy. I've been twice and it is consistently good.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant with friendly fast food style service. But don't let that fool you. The food is simply fresh and amazing. Good stuff. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced even though their chicken is tasty but I ordered it eight piece chicken meal and they will only give you four little tiny cups of sauce or salsa I also order 4 empanadas for my kids and they like sauce dipping sauce but this place would not give me any dipping sauces for the empanadas they charge me $.28 apiece I will never be back they will nickel and dime you for everything"}
{"text":"I had a coupon for 50% off a personal meal. I ordered the 2 piece white - with beans and tortillas as my side. I also added on a buffalo empanada.   I didn't have to wait long and the food was piping hot! That really impressed me because sometimes it can be hit or miss with a fast food joint. First things first, I really enjoyed the chicken. I loved the seasoning! It's so tasty and not overpowering or salty at all. I wasn't a fan of the tortillas so next time I think I'll get the roll. They weren't bad by any means, just not my taste. I also really loved the beans. They were simple but they packed a lot of flavor. I'd order these again!   For me, the empanda was okay. I've had better at other places and I think next time I'll just stick with the chicken.   Overall, this is a solid spot for a quick and easy lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The fried chicken, rice and beans were delicious. The service on the other hand was bad. Me, my boyfriend and our friend with his kid waited in line, ordered our food sat at our table only to find out 20minutes later, they gave our order to someone else. We complained, they took our receipt, because they trashed the one they had and finally filled our order. They were rude when we ask to be compensated for their mistake. Eventually we received 2 extra pieces of chicken. They really need to work on customer service."}
{"text":"Love it. Amazing food with great flavor, and  the chicken is hormones free. I just hope they can add more variety."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great chicken & sides, place has been nice & clean every time I have been there, but I do have a complaint...the place is not properly managed. Why? Because they always run out of their best sides. One day it was plantains, the other it was yucca. Obviously he/she is not doing inventory adequately enough. Other than that, no complaints."}
{"text":"This place tho ! This place is so good I got two piece grilled chicken with Campero beans and lemme tell you ! Way better then el pollo loco .. they spices they use in the chicken are so good . Only complaint is that It's a little too juicy for my liking but it was good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Underwhelming -- We waited almost 20mins on the drive thru line and there were only 4 cars; Upon receiving our order i was extremely dissapointed as the quality of the food was NOTHING like the Campero branches in MA or FL.   Not only does Pollo Campero a recognized fast-food restaurant for some unorthodox reason refuses to include any drinks with their 'combo meals' but then the portions at this particular location were child-sized and overpriced, We are talking $12.99 for a 3pc w/ coleslaw and yucca fries.  Yucca fries were extremely good but everything else sucked, the service, wait time and food quality was horrible; Needless to say i don't think i will ever be stepping foot at this location ever again.   For the small box that i got from Campero i could've gone to Pollo Loco and gotten a $6 meal which would've been both delicious and filling. Sad to say but Pollo Campero has let me down this time around."}
{"text":"Spectacular fried chicken at a great price (nice and juicy). 3 piece w/ side $6.69, 2 piece w/ side 5.29. Grilled chicken is also avail. Empanadas, Camperitos, horchatas. Super friendly staff. Nice decor. Great lunch/dinner spot!"}
{"text":"This place must not clean their grease trap. I work at a nearby business and have been in the parking lot multiple times and grease and sewage have seeped out and oozed into the parking lot causing a nasty smell and mess. Though the food is good, I cant imagine what goes on behind the scenes."}
{"text":"Went here when it first opened so it was a tad busy, but the food was fresh, hot, and delish. The chicken was great. The rice was great. The yuca sticks were good. The empanadas were delish! It was all around just really good, really fresh \"fast food\" I think this place is actually better than some of its competitors but.. that's just my opinion. Some of the workers weren't so friendly, but some were quite friendly, so it worked out. They actually serve you and pick up your plates when you're done, so it's fancy fast food. Will definitely be back for some of that delish chicken."}
{"text":"Thank you for all the 3 star people who do not come anymore.  Chicken is awesome as well as the empanadas.  No wait and fast service with no 3 stars coming to the restaurant anymore.  Thank you Pollo Campero."}
{"text":"If you were a fan of Pioneer Chicken back In the day, the fried chicken is a close companion. Chicken pieces are smaller here than other restaurants, so if you normally order a two piece meal, you should order a three piece here."}
{"text":"The chicken is good here, second time coming to this location. The first time they ran out of creamy cilantro sauce and it was only 6pm. This time I tried the drive-thru and the wait was very long given there was only 1 vehicle in front of us. Also, if the meals come with sauce and tortillas, it would be nice to include them or at least mention it during the ordering process. Check your order here twice, communication is not clear."}
{"text":"My first time being here located on Craig, food/ chicken was amazingly delicious.   In regards to service I wasn't too happy about the service....  I used the bathroom and it was extremely dirty next time I will order to go from the drive-through but overall great food."}
{"text":"My family was so tired of Bojangles. I stumbled across this place online. I was surprised at how tasty the chicken was! Even my Dad, who is picky about his chicken, loves it. The sides are different from what we're used to but so delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good front line service,yet inattentive in the dining area. Thanks to a LS, enjoyed a variety of items. Tip: due to a few bad apples,  you must redeem Living Social vouchers via mobile. No biggie. The empanada trio is the way to go you are indecisive. Of their three options, the verde one was my favorite. Yuca fries were also just right. Campero beans have a great kick and the rice was just okay. I initially  thought I would enjoy the lemon grilled  versus  fried. The fried is yummy and similar to Bonchon Korean fried, yet not fried as hard. Have different sauces which were not explained, maybe I missed the posted descriptions.  The  drive- thru was pretty busy. Will try carryout experience and compare.  My stomach still favors Viva, yet this spot is worthy for rotation."}
{"text":"Came here and service was terrible and they closed early on us as we ate and the food was cold so we refused to pay."}
{"text":"Discovered Pollo Campero on Groupon and now I can't stay away! I've been about 4 times now and have never been disappointed! The food is fast, fresh and cheap while the people friendly, what more could you ask for? I've noticed that they've opened quite a few locations, but I've only been to the South Blvd location. I can't imagine the experience being any different, but thought I should mention :)  I've tried...  Entrees: 1. The Campero Fried Chicken 2. Campero Grilled Chicken 3. Grilled Chicken Bowl 4. Empanadas (All 3 - Chipotle, Verde and Buffalo)  Sides: 1. Campero Rice 2. French Fries 3. Street Corn Salad  4. Plantains 5. Yuca  Drinks/Dessert 1. Guava/Passionfruit 2. Flan  Of those mentioned, my go-to is the Half Chicken Special. You can decide between grilled, fried chicken or half and half. I personally really enjoy both, just depends on your mood. I do have to say the grilled is more flavorful! The special comes with 2 sides and my favorites are probably the campero rice and french fries. Don't get me wrong, the plantains and yuca are delicious, but the portions are smaller :) I didn't care for the flan, but definitely recommend the drinks! Will be back soon Campero!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time. My wife waited an hour for the food. Since its new and the hype is real... i guess its not uncommon.  In my personal opinion, this has been the best fast food chicken place ive ever had. The chicken cooked perfectly and the seasoning???? Wow! Empanadas are delicious!!!  The only thing i was not impressed by were the fries. But, im not there for the fries... so still a 2 thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"I am so happy that this place FINALLY opened. My husband is Guatemalan so I first had Pollo Campero in Guatemala and oh my I was hooked! The flavors are amazing! Whenever we go to San Francisco we always stop to get some Pollo Campero, and super glad I don't have to travel hundreds of miles now to get this amazing yummy goodness. I was disappointed when I did not see El cafécito on the menu.  That was one of the signature items in Guate, and the coleslaw is dirt compared to the original stuff too.  However the chicken itself makes up for the little things that it lacks."}
{"text":"Best rice I've ever had.  Hard to decide between the crispy or roasted chicken, both are great.  Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"5 stars for the grilled chicken & empanadas. I had the corn salad & fries.  I didn't like the fries & the corn salad was good.  Wish it had more corn.  The sauce was a little sweet too.  But the chicken was a hit with my family and that empanada was to die for I bought one just to taste made me want to turn around and get more! The Sauce was amazing. Gooey hot cheese and the chicken was flavorful. Light and flaky crust."}
{"text":"La semana pasada fue mi primera vez que ordené comida de este restaurante que apenas acaba de abrir en mi area, se me antojó el pollo peruano y la verdad que fue lo mas asqueroso que he probado en mi vida, ese pollo es una imitación barata del riquisimo pollo peruano, yo no se porque le echan tanto limon  que hasta los dientes me quedaron templados y me dejo un mal sabor de boca. Para mi fue una gran lección , si quiero comer pollo peruano mejor me voy a un restaurante peruano. El local.muy bonito y limpeo el personal muy bien, amable, respetuoso y bilingue."}
{"text":"I cannot decide if I like the fried or grilled chicken better. Both are delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The chicken had so much lime that im convinced it could produce voltage similiar to a car battery."}
{"text":"I've never been to this place. A friend called and told me he was coming over and that he would bring something for us to eat. He arrived with Pollo Campero, I'd never even heard of it. So I proceeded to try it. We had fried chicken, rice, fries and beans. I tried the beans first. They were a little soupy so I was not impressed...until I tasted them. They were extremely delicious! The best I had ever had. The fries were fries. Nothing different. The rice however was very delicious as well. Lastly, I tried the fried chicken. AMAZING. To be clear, the fried chicken tasted like no other chicken I've ever had in my entire life. Very flavorful! It was the very best chicken I've ever, ever tasted period. Better than Popeyes, better than KFC, and certainly better than bojangles. Better than any other chicken period! Their fried chicken looks very similar to KFC but tastes way better, and I do like KFC a lot. Again, I have not been to this restaurant but I can promise I will be going very very soon. I loved the food completely."}
{"text":"Yaaaas! I love getting lunch here. They have both grilled and fried chicken. Both are so good but I get the grilled...just to be more healthy.   They also have a variety of sides such as yuca fries,black beans, and plantains. I also see they have empanadas, but I haven't tried those yet.   The place is usually clean and when ordering in, staff brings you your meal.   See you there!"}
{"text":"Ordered a 2 piece special (half & half) with fries and rice.  The fried chicken was good but better when dipped in the BBQ sauce.  The grilled chicken was flavorful but a little greasy.  The rice was pretty good and the fries were average.  Two meals for 13 bucks isn't bad either."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and tried the grilled two piece wing and breast combo with the street corn salad as my side. Between dinner rolls and tortillas, I chose the tortillas. It was the perfect portion for a light lunch, my choices made a satisfying and delicious combination. The chicken skin was not as charred/crisp as I would have liked but the meat was tender and I really liked the marinade which was tangy and savory. It went really well the cilantro sauce that I ordered on the side. I was impressed with how fresh and tasty the street corn salad was, which had a nice blend of fresh ripe cherry tomatoes along with corn, roasted pumpkin seeds, cilantro, cotija cheese, salad greens and I think diced green peppers. It was simply dressed and very refreshing. I also received two small corn tortillas which were warm and soft. For me it was great deal for $6 but if you have a big appetite I would recommend ordering another side.  I came at lunch time on a weekday and went through the drive thru. I heard some others in line placing their orders in Spanish but I ordered in English with no problems. It wasn't crowded but it wasn't as fast as some other drive thrus I've used. However the customer service was good and the employees were friendly and polite.   Overall a very good experience, I'm looking forward to trying it again!"}
{"text":"I came here on opening day hoping to take a picture with that chicken character, but he was nowhere to be found. I'd never tried this popular Latin chicken chain despite living near several locations in the past, so we lined up to order food. It was about a 30 minute wait within the first hour of opening.   For dining in, our food was delivered to our table moments later on real plates with silverware, and we were already sipping on a sweet guava agua fresca poured by the cashier. The street corn salad is more interesting than most fast food side dishes, with grilled corn, queso fresco, cherry tomatoes, cilantro, pumpkin seeds, and salad greens. It is not heavily dressed so I like to add a little chipotle honey mustard or creamy cilantro sauce. You won't find mac and cheese or mashed potatoes at this chicken place, but I can recommend the fried yuca, sweet plantains, and coleslaw. I'm not usually a coleslaw fan, but I saw a bowl on every other table and had to try it. It has crunchy cabbage and green bell pepper, no carrots. The veggies are finely chopped instead of shredded and swimming in creamy dressing-- not a light salad.  Oh, they also serve chicken. It smells better than El Pollo Loco but my critique ends there. I brought it home for my husband and he was craving more fried chicken by dinner time. At that point the line had extended to several hours, so he held off until Saturday evening and waited in the drive thru for over an hour. The horchata is somewhere between the very different Mexican and Salvadoran styles, but it is good. The \"Peruvian\" citrus marinated grilled chicken appears to have a lot of seasoning, but he says the fried chicken is much better. On both visits, we requested legs and thighs and found white meat mixed in with the order. It's understandable for such a busy grand opening with lines longer than conservative choice Chik-fil-a. Try all the sauces!  Save your receipt and complete the short online survey in exchange for a $5 off $20 coupon if you're already planning your next trip to Pollo Campero."}
{"text":"If you are expecting something like El Pollo Loco, do not come here. Chicken is either deep fried or blackened (aka burned ) on the grill. Pinto beans taste straight from the can. Coleslaw pretty good. No salsa or salsa bar. Edible, but will not be a favorite."}
{"text":"BEST FRIED CHICKEN!!!!!!!! The fried yuka and campero rice are my favorite, I have been here multiple times and the staff is great and very helpful. The rotisserie chicken is also great but nothing beats the fried chicken. For dessert try the empanada.   I would have to say that this is the best fried chicken I have ever had, I hope they open more locations, I drive 30 minutes but it's worth it  Please open one in concord"}
{"text":"I'm waiting for the new one on east Charleston.I live right  around the corner. I've heard great things about it,so I'm  anxious to try it.I love fried chicken & latin food."}
{"text":"I watched Pollo Campero get transformed from shady used car dealership to awesome chicken restaurant.  I waited a few weeks after it opened to go try it out.  I walked in and was quickly (and warmly) greeted by the employees at the counter.  They offered us menus to look at and answered any of our questions.  We took some time to peruse and ordered away at the counter.  My dad and I tried the empanada trio (getting all flavors), Mike ordered the 2 piece chicken meal with one fried and one grilled.  My mom ordered a bowl.    We sat down with our number and waited for our meals to be delivered.  Meals are served on real plates which surprised us.  The best choice out of all of our meals was definitely the chicken meal, but the empanadas are delicious as well, with the bowl coming in a super close second.    Pollo Campero has different flavors of juices - they'll let you try one before you commit.  There's also a drive-thru, which I'm sure I'll try soon.  I need to go back soon!"}
{"text":"First time. Food was delicious and it was at a fair price. I had the Empanada's, one each of the three they offer. The buffalo flavor was the best of the three. Staff was friendly and prompt. Place was clean."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. I walked into this resturant and I was impressed with the cleanliness of the front lobby. The dinning area, not so much. I don't eat breasts and thighs and wanted 3 wings. The manager came over and explained he wasn't able to do that but I could get 2 wings and a leg so that's what I got. I wanted to try their rice as a side but they were out of rice. I didn't want beans or fries so I had to pay extra for the street corn salad. I ordered the guava juice and it was pretty tasty.  The food took forever to come to the table. 34 minutes to be exact. The chicken was ok. The plantains were nice and ripe. I love mexican street corn but their street corn salad was not good. It needed more cojita cheese and salt. I struggled between 2 stars and 3 stars but I guess a three will work."}
{"text":"All about their fried chicken! Went here last Sun on the way back from hiking at Sedona. Hubby ordered the 2 piece fried with Yucca fries & I ordered the 2 piece Grilled Chicken with rice & Plantains. The star was the fried Chicken, but the Yucca fries came close second. The Grilled Chicken was kind of bland in my opinion. Overall their Fried Chicken is worth 5 stars & worth another visit while in town"}
{"text":"The absolute best experience here! Happened upon this gem and couldn't be happier that I did. Fresh, great quality food and outstanding service. Julio helped us and when he heard it was our first time he gave us a run down of the menu and also let us try a lot of samples. Highest highest ratings for this excellent place!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, THIS WAS THE BEST FAST FOOD EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. I am appalled (In a good way).   So my mother is always going on and on about \"Pollo Campero\" and makes it her mission to take me to lunch there today. I've seen this establishment a few times while driving on Thomas Rd but never put much thought into having a meal there.  We arrive at \"Pollo Campero\" and right away the smell makes me savagley hungry. Their menu included many sides from ceaser salads to white rice mixed with black beans. While seeming like a very much Mexican themed restaurant, i was surprised they served \"yucca frita\" and \"platanos fritos\" (fried plantanes), which are traditionally found in Central and South American dishes as well as Carribean dishes. Every side dish was nothing like a fast food restaurant, the rice and vegtables tasted just like it was home made (amazing). I must emphasize this again, THE SIDE DISHES ARE RESTAURANT QUALITY.   I ordered the \"5 Dollar Meal\" which includes two pieces of chicken (grilled or fried) and two sides,  and a dinner roll or tortillas. I felt bad about paying so little for such a large and freshly prepared meal. The ceaser salad was half of the plate and so crisp and fresh :)  Another thing, I have never been treated so well at a fast food restaurant in my life! Again, I cannot emphasize this enough! The owner even came out and gave us coupons for our next visit after asking us if there was anything they can do for us. The cashier lady walked over to our table to give us crayons and a coloring book for my little nephew. When we left, the entire staff waved goodbye. Now tell me that doesn't sound like a cheesey Pleasantville skit, only it's true!  The restaurant was decorated great, with different pictures of landscapes on the wall. The music was of excellent taste as well, mixing different latin music from different regions of Latin American. The restaurant was very clean and organized. I give this restaurant a full 5 stars and recommend everyone to try it out sometime, you will be amazed as well :)   I guess this made me officially a \"regular\".  (Quick recommendation: Opt for the grilled chicken, you will never taste chicken the same ever again.. goodness! :) )"}
{"text":"Very good...they're crowded but they move the line very nicely and they bring your food to u when u dine n...customer service is good  and the food was great there grilled chicken is awesome the rice & plantains were all great will definitely go back..."}
{"text":"Great little international chain with a couple of locations in Charlotte.  The grilled chicken is so juicy with its bright citrus notes it makes KFC's version taste like saw dust.  Our inaugural visit could not have gone better.  They coached us on their menu, sides, and drinks.  A few minutes later, voila, our meals appear as ordered.  Well, we made little piggies of ourselves with chicken juice drooling off our chins while we liked fingers clean.  Nothing was left except the silverware and plates.  So good.  When we think of American fast food and compare it to Pollo Campero, there's really no comparison.  Viva la Pollo Campero!  Give 'em a finger-lickin' whirl."}
{"text":"Finally came to eat here last night and I was so hopeful that this place was gonna be a decent place to eat if I wanted some quick dinner for my family. However, the food, and service left much to be desired. There was no one ahead of me so I placed my order immediately once I walked in. The cashier recommended that I try the Campero Beans so I ordered a 12 piece meal, which came with a choice three sides, and tortillas or dinner rolls. I decided on the Campero Beans, plantains, and french fries. I also split my order for half tortillas and half rolls. The price of this meal was $29.29. After ordering I spent at least 20 minutes in the lobby watching a woman fill my order. She first boxed my chicken, which ended up sitting with out heat for the whole time I waited. The employee stumbled around piecing my to go order together and about 10 minutes into my wait she tells me there are no beans. I order a different side and continue to wait. I see this woman put in a fresh batch of fries so I'm wondering why they boxed my chicken when the rest of my food wasn't ready. When I get my food I look over the order and notice the rolls are more like rocks so I give them back right away and take the whole order of tortillas. I get home to survey the food and see that the fried chicken pieces are very small in comparison to other chicken places, I mean noticeably smaller. The fried chicken also had been cooked some time ago because the skin looked leathery and the meat was dry. The grilled chicken was ok but I'm not too fond of the spices used. The sides were just ok but I'd never spend any more money here. Prices are way too high for less than mediocre food and slow service."}
{"text":"The food at Pollo Campero is wonderful and the service was great.  This is sincerely the best grilled chicken I've ever had and the fried chicken ain't no joke either!!!  The crispy rice bowl was wonderful and the plantains were delectable.  Not so impressed with the Yuca fries they were kinda bland, but maybe that was just me cause a lot of people love them... but the regular fries were crispy and skinny like I like them.  Wish they served guacamole because that was the only thing missing from a FANTASTIC Latin fast food experience.  Will definitely be back and there is living social/groupon right now so no excuse not to try it!!"}
{"text":"Really good! Have heard bad reviews from others but upon visiting my first time the chicken was great and the staff was super friendly! When the girl brought out our food I mentioned that the soda machine spout for ice tea was only squirting water, she fixed it right away and let me know. They were out of many salsas too and they sincerely apologized. Will come back for more amazing chicken!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the order twice was not correct. I live in Wilmington NC and drive to Charlotte to get a little taste of back home and I was so upset when I arrived home and the order was incorrect. Food good but need to ensure that the to go food is right."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now love both their grilled and fried chicken.  Sides of plantains and yuca fries are exceptional too.  Expect to wait for takeout where not fast food, but tastes better than \"fast food.\""}
{"text":"You have to try this kitchen once in a lifetime, taste is unique, side orders on menu are also very tasty I recommend cole slam, campero beans and street corn salad, also dont forget to ask for the different sauces to companion your chicken.  About location place is not too busy and staff is very friendly, if you want to have a nice dine in, But also you can order to go or by the drive tru."}
{"text":"Your old manager is back!!! Im so happy he is still with Pollo Campero  The food and service is always excellent, especially when he is working. A employee told me his name is Arnardo. The employees are always smiling, the guest are always smiling. He is friendly with the guest. The food is better i swear when he works. Happy people make better food!!!"}
{"text":"This place really surprised for me as it is considered as \"fast food\". Arrived on a Monday evening and still had a crowd. I got the 4 piece fried chicken with two sides, plantains and corn salad. The chicken came with a side of a mayo dipping sauce, delicious and everything was perfectly cooked and they brought the food to your table.  Everyone was friendly and accommodating as I was unsure what to order when I arrived. Highly recommended. Can't wait to go back and try the grilled chicken."}
{"text":"Great experience from the moment I walked in. Service was prompt and very friendly. I had a Living Social deal $14 for $20 worth of food and a yelp check-in offer for another free piece of chicken #win.  The only advice I would offer to management, is that when preparing large orders for dine in customers it would be best to not prepare the orders by the registers where other patrons are talking and putting their orders in. I'm very particular about ppl talking over my food and that's a big no no.   I ordered the grand opening special to go and everything is delicious!! So if that one thing can be fixed, this review will go to 5 stars for sure.  Wonderful staff, wonderful food!"}
{"text":"If you dont mind venturing a little bit in the kinda hood, O.M.GEE! This is tasy and fresh! The lime grilled asado chicken is...for being fast food, amazing! The yuca is very fresh and the empanadas are very very peruvian delicious. And, they promote their chicken as hormone and additive free, never frozen. A four piece with two sides is 8.99! Im impressed....And their restaurant grade is above 97. Ive found my lazy-Sunday-dont-want-to-cook-but-cant-spend-a-fortune-place to go. Yum!"}
{"text":"This location recently opened just a few weeks ago. I used to live in Central America when I was younger and remember loving the chicken here, specifically the citrus grilled chicken.   I went for the first time last week to try it out and was so disappointed when they were out of the citrus grilled chicken at about 8:00pm in the evening. Went again just tonight with my family at 7:00pm and again they were saying they were completely out of the citrus grilled chicken again!!!  How do you run out of your signature item during the peak of dinner time for customers??? Seriously? This is the sign of a very poorly run establishment. I probably will not go back again. Pretty sad!"}
{"text":"The chicken is reminiscent of Pioneer Chicken. The crust is crispy, flavorful, not too much salt. The beans, rice, and coleslaw were absolutely packed with flavor and a little spice. We will be returning. Not a piece of chicken was wasted."}
{"text":"I tried Pollo Campero for the first time today. I never noticed them when I visit Compare across the street, I'm thrilled I found them today.  I ordered the 8 piece Camperitos meal with Campero rice and fried yuca. Camperitos are boneless white meat crispy bites, a little larger than nuggets. They weren't dry, which was a concern for me when I ordered them. They were crispy as advertised, but not oily or greasy. The rice was delish,  a healthy portion with cilantro, roasted corn and onions. The yuca was perfectly fried, again not greasy.  I'm looking forward to returning to try the fried chicken that most people ordered. Totally yummy.  I took 1 star of for the condition of the restroom. Totally gross. Considering the constant cleaning of the tables and floor I saw the staff doing, someone should venture into the restrooms once in a while."}
{"text":"Greasy , Wet , soagy . They were out of chicken, so i got a mixed of what ever they had left."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me and I thought okay I'll try it because they were comparing it to El Pollo Loco. I was impressed with the quality of food and flavors. I got the 2 piece leg and thigh, one fried and one grilled, just to try the options. Both were very good but the grill chicken was delicious. I also got the Campero rice, a side of the campero beans and the empanada. The empanada was so good and creamy. The beans and rice were very good too. I decided to eat in there and they served my food on a real plate and brought it to my table. The staff is nice. I'll be coming back to try the other sides and another empanada."}
{"text":"Loved Pollo Campero on the first visit! I'd heard about the one opening a while back on N. Sharon Amity, but this location was a little closer to the breweries we were at for the day. At 10 PM the place had many people still dining in, which was a good sign. The atmosphere, for what is somewhere between fast food and fast casual, was modern and clean. Since we'd never been before, the cashier was helpful in guiding us in what to order, pointing out that there was a $5 special on the two piece combo meal.  I opted for the grilled chicken and upgraded to the corn salad and plantains for an extra $0.60 total. Well worth it! We also got the 3-piece empanada meal, and while decent, may not be something we'd try again. We had just tried some empanadas from Arepas Grill at Three Spirits brewing and these were not quite as good, though the filling was tasty. The empanada that really stole the show was the dulce de leche dessert empanada. I think we could've ordered a dozen of these and been happy.  The price for all of this goodness was only about $15 - well worth it. Several people had plates of fried chicken that looked amazing, so that is something to look forward to. They also appear to have online ordering, which we'd probably try in the future. Even though it is a chain, would definitely recommend for fresh food at a good price."}
{"text":"Visited just for the empanadas. This was my first time here and probably my last. Keep in mind that I've worked in fast food and could easily teach employees better customer service than what I received here.  First, I came in around noon and they only had one type of empanada available. Fine.  Second, this place definitely has poor customer service. The cashier was busy talking and joking with the packer and cook and dropped the occasionally f-word like there weren't customers around.  Third, packer just looked at me to let me know my order was ready and then just handed me the order without a word. Like okay? Thanks I guess.   If I was a secret shopping, this place would fail without a doubt. The empanadas weren't great either."}
{"text":"Sides are decent. Grilled chicken is really great. Nice texture & wonderful flavor. It took forever when we ordered it though. Fried chicken is very good too. Chicken empanadas are by far my favorite menu item. Moist & very tasty filling."}
{"text":"Umm Hell yea. Fuk KFC and Popeyes them. They have nothing on Pollo Campero. Your fried and grilled chicken is good and seasoned. Fresh meat that doesn't make you question if it's old or should be served. The chains will be stepping up their game to compete but remember who started with quality."}
{"text":"The chicken is delicious, no doubt about it... BUT service needs to improve.  I just went to the drive through and ordered the 4 pc meal, there was only one car in front of me and I waited more than 10 minutes with the car still in front of me.  I drove around and left.  This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"OMG! The best fried chicken I ever had, tasty, juicy, not greasy!! I have been to all of them (Roscoes Chicken and Waffles, Popeyes, Bojangles, KCF, Churches, Louisiana Fried Chicken etc) nothing compares to this. Try it!!!"}
{"text":"I love pollo campero. Now granted, I only tried the grilled chicken meal but that's enough to keep me coming back. It's that's Latin seasoning. It's just flavorful as hell. If u get a 2pc, u gon end up wishing u got a 3. Try this place. Just don't go on Sundays in the afternoon because this place gets packed."}
{"text":"Great fried chicken!  Yes it's a chain, and very casual but the chicken is awesome!  And they have fried plantains which I live too!  This restaurant was spotless and the staff were very nice.  I will be back for more chicken!"}
{"text":"Good food but horrible service and inconsistent serving sizes. Also, employees do not inform you their \"Combo Meal\" does not come with a beverage. While in line I witnessed a lot of double transactions. The second being for beverages. Visited twice and both were not so great experience. Hope things gets better in the near future."}
{"text":"Just about the best chicken you will find and hormone free too.  The sides are interesting.   The Yucatan fries and corn salad are the best.  I have been to both locations and prefer the Sharon amity store.  I think the staff is friendlier."}
{"text":"I have been to both locations multiple times but continue to think this one is not as good.  I used a living social coupon and ordered an 8 piece dark, fried.  I got 7 pieces.  I paid for 2 extra sauces which was all that was in the bag.  Apparently none come with if you buy some.  The man that took my order continually interrupted me and I had to repeat everything 3 times.  One of my 7 pieces, a leg, looked like it had bite out of it.  The last time I was there, the secret sauce, you get one with a 2 piece order, had about a teaspoon in a 2 ounce container.  I had to pay 30 cents more to get a container that had some sauce in it."}
{"text":"Both grilled & fried chicken are excellent! Different dipping sauces & a variety of sides. Highly recommended. Had the plaintains & black beans. Half chicken special w/ 2 sides is a great value. If you like Viva Chicken, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"This is food is amazing... the grilled chicken with Cilantro sauce.. wow The yuca fries with cilantro sauce instead of campero sauce. The rice is also good"}
{"text":"Great place for latin america inspired chicken. They offer grilled and fried options for the chicken. I got the 3 piece with a side. The chicken was very good and well seasoned. I think i like the fried a little better yet the grilled is very tasty (and a little bit healthier). As a side i ordered the campero rice which was really good (but really small for 3 pieces of chicken). They also had wonderful sauces (cilantro honey mustard and buffalo based with a latin american spin). Overall it was really good. One of the better chicken spots on this side of town! Will def be back"}
{"text":"I'm putting a review on behalf of my aunt and uncle. They went last night to this Pollo Campero it was around 8:45. Mind you they close at 10 PM and they only had 4 breast. Rudely they said we only have 4 breast and my aunt said okay that's okay will take 3. Right after in her rude manner she said but it will cost more.  Then my uncle said never mind and they left."}
{"text":"Food is great has become one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. I've ordered the grilled and fried chicken both are very good. The Campero rice is delicious as well."}
{"text":"Disappointed because it's no where near the original one in El Salvador but it's basically a Central American El pollo loco.  It's a great last minute dinner joint, not a lunch spot."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  Our first trip here and we all ordered different items. The shredded chicken bowl, chicken bites and fried chicken.  Everything was great! The corn salsa was AMAZING! When we're in town, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Tried this after I heard great things about this new chicken place originally from Latin America. We ordered though the drive thru which we were able to smell the chicken from and it smelled delicious. The only complaint I have is the wait time for chicken. It took a long time to get though the drive thru. When we ordered chicken we wanted fried and grilled. The attendant said they didn't have enough fried chicken so he couldn't give me that many fried pieces  we enjoyed what we tried, but be prepared to wait a while."}
{"text":"first time here SO EXCITED!, ..standing in line to order and the lady at the counter says \" sorry No pollo!, , WTF? ..i thought \"pollo\" was the reason this place exists .. this place sucks!, ...can you picture a lemonade stand with no \" lemon\".?, ..a fruit stand with no fruit?.. peanut butter without the peanuts?..what a disappointment"}
{"text":"The food's decent but the customer service was horrible. It was our first and last trip there. We waited in line for almost 40 mins just for them to get our order wrong; their manager; she was a complete jerk when my husband asked what she could do to help compensate the order they got wrong and for our 40 mins wait...she did nothing but gave us a huge attitude, so we're pretty much done, first impressions goes a long way."}
{"text":"Pollo Campero has delicious grilled chicken!  On my first visit, my husband and I ordered grilled chicken, plantains, sweet corn salad and empanadas. The chicken pieces were decent sized and full of flavor. I don't know what type of spices they use but the taste is fresh and citrus-y.   On our second visit we ordered an 8 piece combo that included mostly grilled with a couple of fried. We also had plantains and beans. The fried chicken was juicy but no where near as flavorful as the grilled.   The first two visits were dine in visits and every visit after has been to-go.  From our visits we have determined we will only order grilled chicken and to only order it to-go.  There have also been a few issues with trying to place our order as there is sometimes a language barrier; however, someone usually appears quickly to recover the situation.    Enjoy... the grilled chicken!"}
{"text":"We've been meaning to come check this place out but never had a chance until now. Heard from lots of people that their chicken was really good, so I had to come see for my self.  The boyfriend and I got the 8 piece chicken family meal and it came with two sides. Decided on half grilled and half fried chicken. With a side of french fries and rice.  Grilled chicken had a wonderful char and lots of seasoning to it. The fried chicken on the other hand did not and was not as crispy as we would of liked it to be. We also tried the empanadas, and honestly, I spit it out. It was horrible!   Staff was beyond friendly and place was very neat and clean inside. Wouldn't mind going back, just not any time soon."}
{"text":"Flavor is alright. Nothing too special from say KFC. Got a 4 piece combo with fries and coleslaw. 2 pieces were fried and 2 pieces were lime marinaded. Also got a 3 of their empanadas. For 17.00 ehhh. Would I go back, probably not. Also waited for about 25 minutes in the drive through line. :-/"}
{"text":"Hello Pollo Campero! I visit the one on East Charleston Blvd. a few times a week.  The FLAVOR on their grilled chicken & empanadas is DELICIOUS. It reminds me of the chicken in my mom's hometown in the Dominican Republic. I also get the sweet plantains, I'm Caribbean I need my platanos maduro.  Don't forget to request their Pollo Campero sauce! It Is So GOOD! If you dine in it's almost like you are at a RESTAURANT and not a \"fast food\" joint.  They bring your order to the table in BEAUTIFUL porcelain plates & they also clean up after you. The employees have always been friendly with me & provide great customer service. I always leave a tip even though it is not a traditional practice with fast food place. Their drive through is pretty quick. The only reason why I don't rate them a 5 is because if you order food a little later in the evening it doesn't taste as fresh or juicy. Other than that it's a must TRY! Goodbye Pollo Loco & KFC."}
{"text":"The Grilled Chicken marinade is so delicious!!!Their fried chicken is ok but isn't bursting with flavor like the grilled. The campero beans were my favorite side. They are so good, they remind me of frijoles charros, yum! Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pollo Campero a couple of times.Each time I've ordered the empanadas.There are three different choices (chicken verde,chicken buffalo,and chicken chipotle).All three are good but I prefer the chicken buffalo.The empanadas are made fresh to order and are priced reasonably.I've also tried two of their juices which have a unique taste.The Jamaica juice is my favorite."}
{"text":"My work buddies and I decided to check this place out.  The restaurant chain is popping up in different places, even saw it recently on a business trip to San Francisco.  We were excited to check out the Vegas location and get some good grilled and fried chicken.  Well...we didn't really end up getting it.  To start, the service was weak and there was a number of problems with our orders.  For instance, they ran out of the grilled chicken, so we had to either opt for fried chicken or wait a while for the new batch.  Then, with my order, I got fries and a dinner roll (the roll had ZERO flavor!) instead of beans and corn tortillas.  With the fried chicken...well, let's just say that it gave me childhood flashbacks of eating Banquet chicken at family dinner time that my parents used to buy from the grocery store frozen foods section.  The one redeeming item, however, was the grilled chicken as it had decent flavor...just not up to the caliber of El Pollo Loco's chicken though.  Oh, and the hot sauces...the red hot sauce wasn't that bad...but the green one...yuck, it looked like green slimy sludge and lacked flavor.  All in all, not a very good first-time restaurant experience...none of us plan to go back again...just doesn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"So my coworker is from Guatemala, so he has known about Pollo Campero forever.  Last week at work he tells us about this new chicken spot all the way on Craig.  Being the food ninja that I am, i was naturally curious.  So I began my Sunday Funday with a drive out to North Las Vegas for a chicken adventure.  But before I went, I did my due diligence  and checked out a few reviews on Yelp.  Thanks to Nelson Q for recommending the empanadas.    The first thing I do when I go to a fast food join is the look at the windows and see what the specials are.  An 8 piece for $12 sign caught my attention.  I got there at noon and there was hardly a line.  Maybe 3 or 4 people in front of me.  There was a ton of chicken already cooked under the warmer, so I knew i wouldn't be waiting forever to get my chicken.  When it is my turn to order, I get the 8 pieces of chicken... asked for it half fried and half grilled, legs & thighs and a chipotle empanada.  The cashier informs me that they have 3 empanadas for $5.  This was great news, because I was pretty curious as to how all 3 savory empanadas tasted.  I paid for my food and as I was getting my drink, the cashier came over to me and said it would be a 20 minute wait for grilled.  I told him to give me all fried, which ended up being 2 legs, 2 thighs, 2 wings, and 2 breasts.    Took less than 5 minutes to get my food.  I like that the dine in orders actually come on plates.  It made me feel like I was eating at a friend's house rather than at a chain restaurant.  Albeit plastic plates, they are much better than wafer thin Styrofoam plates you get at most fast food joints.    On to the good stuff... the chicken... oh my word... what can I say about this chicken... when you first bite into it you get the crunch of that crispy skin.  It was almost like biting into a chicken skin chip!!  Then you get that unique flavor of the chicken.  I have no idea what type of marinade, spices, or herbs they used... but my mouth was instantly transported to flavortown!!  Don't even get me started on the chicken breast.  They were cooked to perfection!!  I've never had a chicken breast so tender and juicy.  I swear it was softer and juicier than the thighs were.  Simply amazing.  Chicken fried to perfection with a total unique flavor that I have never experienced in my life.  I'm going to make a bold statement here... Pollo Campero has the best tasting fried chicken I have ever eaten!!  There you go, I said it.  Mark my words.  Best fried chicken EVER!!    I've known Nelson Q for a while, so I trust his opinion.  If the man says to get the empanadas, you get the empanadas!!  And boy let me tell you, this man was on point with this suggestion!!  The dough of the empanada is light, flaky, and crispy.  I was expecting it to be thicker and heavier, but they were so light and fluffy.  Such a nice surprise.  The buffalo was the first one I ate.  I'd say it was just ok.  The next one I ate was the chipotle empanada.  This one was much tastier than the buffalo.  I loved the taste of the filling.  I can't quite describe the taste, just that after you try it, all you'll be saying is wow that was good.  Last but not least was the chili verde empanada.  As good as the chipotle one was, I'd have to say the chili verde was my favorite.  My mom also agreed that this one was her favorite.  Everyone knows that mom's are always right!!  I really liked that there were chunks of chili tucked inside the empanada.  All empanadas are filled with chicken along with their respective \"sauces.\"    I highly recommend this place to anyone unsure if it is worth the drive to North Las Vegas.  Grab your keys, get in your car and get going!!  You will thank me later, this I promise."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious for fast food . It's like eating back home. I missed this place so much and anticipated its arrival. Unfortunately the service every time I've gone has been sub par. They've gotten my order wrong, ran out of chicken, and are so slow every single time . :( so disappointing"}
{"text":"This place stated out in Guatemala with a prized chicken recipe and boy are they good. My father was from Guatemala and I lived down there for a few months as a small child and I got addicted to the empanadas. Which are different from all others. The crust is light and flaky and the filling is just right. They shred the chicken and put it in here. I got the buffalo one which have a full jalapeño inside. The rice was well seasoned and the beans were perfect. It was a real taste of my childhood and as luck would have it they are building a second location down on South Blvd."}
{"text":"This is a yummy little fast casual joint with Latin inspired food. It's a meh part of town but a pretty darn tasty fast lunch. The staples are the fried or grilled Chicken, with sides such as black beans, fresh corn salad or fries. I recently tried the chipotle chicken and verde empanadas. I LOVED the chipotle chicken, but wasn't a huge fan of the verde. I think that sauce is mayo based and I just can't. Lol! I had the black beans for a side and they were very good and tasted authentic. The place itself was clean, the staff was quick and friendly as well. Will definitely drop in again if I'm in a hurry and craving something different than your normal \"chicken place\"!"}
{"text":"Definitivamente me Encanta este pollo, ya era necesario uno aquí en Las Vegas!!  Asistimos el primer día que lo abrieron y realmente valió la pena la espera de casi 2 horas en Línea... Y hoy por segunda ocasión visite pero por medio de Drive Thru no se tardaron ni 10 minutos en mi orden"}
{"text":"I loved my first time here. I had the 3 price grilled meal with street corn salad , dinner roll and soda for $9.41 including tax . The only item I didn't like was the dinner roll .  I chose this option over tortillas and I regretted it . Not only was the dinner roll not tasty but they don't have butter or honey to serve with it . Next time I will stick to the tortillas. Everything else was GREAT! The grilled chicken had a citrus lime flavor and tasted like it just came off the grill . This grilled chicken has a much better flavor than the other chicken places (you know who I'm talking about.) The street corn salad is also a must have item . If you want another side -do yourself a favor and get an extra side of this corn salad in addition to the other side that you may think you want. I was also impressed that the food was served on a real plate instead of plastic or paper. The restaurant seemed clean and the employees were happy but productive.  I don't have this chain in my neighborhood, but I will gladly make the trip to this side of town to eat here again ."}
{"text":"I stopped by around 9:30 pm on Monday night. The drive thru was about 10 cars deep so I opted to go in to try this chicken. The place was busy. The line wasn't very long but it took about 15 minutes to get to the register. The chicken was tasty. The empanada was good. The rice and beans sides were probably my favorite part of the dinner. I got my food to go so it wasn't the hottest when I had it so I want to try it again sometime when I can eat at the restaurant. All in all a nice alternative to El Pollo Loco. The only thing they need to figure out is staffing. There seemed to be too many people behind the counter and yet the cashiers regularly disappeared to help out the the other workers who look confused. The drive thru cashiers just stood in their area by the window and didn't help out at all. It really seemed like no one was in charge. So I think as soon as the back of house staff gets their stuff together it will be a more pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I always enjoy my food at Pollo Campero.  Great Latin American flavors at a reasonable price. Their grilled (or roasted??) chicken is every bit as good as their fried, maybe a little better. If you dine in the restaurant, after ordering at the register they bring the food out to your table. I've observed that the dining area is always very clean. I haven't ever seen food all over the floor or on the tables like in some restaurants.  If you want good Spanish food at a reasonable price you'll enjoy Pollo Campero."}
{"text":"Wowwww i will add this place like one of my favorites, customer service from Ana sosa was top notch , i was walking around like lost in the place thinking just to go next door for a coffe and pastry, but ana come around asking me how she can help. Well she explain the full menu and make some suggestions,i end it up with a empanada, later a piece of chicken with fry's and salad, Ana have a full knowledge of the menu and she can read the people to make some suggestions, i will comeback with friends and family, this place is very tasty and clean environment to eat , cant explain the experience but people if you read this review go and try your self. Highly recommended from a loyal yelper"}
{"text":"Pretty sure it is safe to say this is the absolute best chicken around. So juicy and delicious. The breading on the chicken is delicious. I love there empanadas! It's a different almost custard like filling! I usually get there street corn salad and rice. Definitely check them out! We use postmates and they deliver it to us which is a even bigger benefit!"}
{"text":"I came in on Thursday at 11:30 am. I ordered the 8pc mix meal with half fried and half grilled chicken with two sides - Street corn salad and sweet plantains, with 4 dinner rolls. Total $22.29. This was my first time here. I waited maybe 8 minutes. The food, everything was very good! The inside of the restaurant was clean, where to stand in line was a bit disorganized. If more than 3 customers are in line, they are blocking the walkway. I appreciated the recommendations from the employee, since this was my first time."}
{"text":"Delicious Grilled Chicken. Love the fries as well. Wish they had different types of soda."}
{"text":"The chicken had a lot of flavor and it barely needed any extra sauce. The empanadas were delicious. The place was very clean and the food didn't take long. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I can never decide between their fried or grilled chicken, it's so good! Just try it and I promise you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"I dream for many year to have t a Pollo Campero closer to where I leave. The food is delicious. The chicken is juicy tender inside with all the flavor of special latin spices and delicous sides and desserts such as plaintains and flan. This chain in HUGE in latin America. Tierno jugoso y crujiente :)"}
{"text":"I went here because I randomly saw a friend review it. I was actually really impressed. I got a piece of the grilled chicken and a piece of the fried and both exceeded expectations. When I come back, I will actually be torn on whether I get both or load up on one or the other. They had a great selection of sides and juices so you have to be careful because all that deliciousness can get your bill up in a hurry. But everything on it's own is actually really reasonably priced. Customer service was excellent and I actually watched them make fresh chimichurri because they had run out of it for the beans. Was actually surprised at first to learn it's a fairly large chain because their quality control seemed really great."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place. Both the fried and citrus grilled chicken pieces I tried were tasty. I expected the street corn salad to have some type of citrus vinagrette on it but I squeezed the lime that came with the chicken on it and it was perfect. The campero beans were really good. I would love to have a big bowl on a cold day. Overall I enjoyed everything and plan on eating here again."}
{"text":"Food was great. I would compare this to the infamous Viva Chicken. It's a more affordable version that also offers fried chicken. Everything was flavorful. Loved the empanadas. The sauces they have available were really good. Only negative is the guava juice that they have behind the counter. It was a little on the thick side."}

{"text":"El sabor no es nada como el de mi país Guatemala Esta horrible  Yo no los refiero para nada   Es pollo sin sal"}
{"text":"Love this place. One of the best chicken i've ever had. The grilled chicken is perfectly marinated. The sides are all good."}
{"text":"Flavorful, delicious premium white chicken! Seasoned to perfection! Sweet fried plantains (platanos), delicious sides to choose from! And the horchata...tasty! The staff is so friendly too! All of this, and priced right! It's a Central American flavor that sets itself apart from the usual fried chicken. The blend of spices will excite the palate for sure!"}
{"text":"The fried Chicken is tasty, well seasoned and  fresh. Very affordable.  They have groupons too! If you want a good quick meal for your family,  this is the place. The staff are really nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for years for this place to open up in Vegas. Hands down the best Chicken you will taste. Lines are pretty long but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food is amazing everything is just right !! Service not so much. The girls at the register are rude to everyone. They also try to over charge you with things you didn't order keep an eye on that and double check your receipt."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Definitely feels like los pollos hermanos! Try the dulce de leche empanadas!"}
{"text":"This has been added to my lunch rotation! Grilled chicken was great, the spices and marinade are amazing.  Had to try the street corn salad and I wasn't disappointed, it was a cool take on one of my favorite Mexican snacks.  Give this place a try and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Its da bomb for the food; chicken grill and fried, sides; rice and my fave the street corn!!!! OMG! Restaurant is clean, kitchen to the dining area, customer service is great, cashiers and manager are attentive and friendly. And the authentic plate when we dine in, is a super! I will recommend this to family and friends, and will come back  again!"}
{"text":"I love pollo campero!  They have the best fried chicken in Charlotte. The juices are very tasty - a tad on the sweet side. Sides are good - I like the rice, yuca fries and plantains. I have not tried the grilled chicken. The fried chicken is excellent. I've eaten there about 10 times and it's always been excellent."}
{"text":"Definitivamente no es igual al de Guate,el sabor es diferente, que desilusión. Pero orgulloso de verlos crecer"}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST place in town to get fried chicken! I ordered the 3 piece chicken and requested 2 hand-breaded fried chicken and 1 grilled. The fried chicken was not as greasy compared to Bojangles or Popeyes. It was super crispy and I could tell the meat was fresh! The grilled one was good too! Make sure you try the cilantro sauce with your chicken, goes well with it! The 3 piece meal came with a side and choice of a dinner roll or tortillas, all for a reasonable price. Customer service was great and the restaurant was clean. I left without feeling nauseous or \"ughhh\" like I usually felt after eating at those other fried chicken joints. Will definitely be back more often!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. We went inside to place an order and waited 46 minutes from when we ordered until we got our food. And only got it because we went up to counter and asked where our food was. Then they handed it to us on a tray when we ordered it to go!! NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"We went during Saturday lunch hour.  Probably should have gone in the restaurant instead of using their drive through window.  They forgot to give me my tortillas and did not give me the Latin sides (and I paid additional for them!!!)  They were out of grilled chicken do we had to settle with half and half.  The grilled chicken was the best. Cole slaw was bland and watery, fried chicken was way too dry. Even the horchata didn't taste right!"}
{"text":"Everything I've heard made me want to check this place out. I mean come on...Mexican with a drive through. Brilliant! We had a Groupon so we had to dine in. That created a high class problem however. The food was so inexpensive that I we had to struggle to use the entire $20.  My wife wanted all wings but they unfortunately have the servings pre-made and don't allow substitutions. No big deal. They do however allow you to mix and match between their Citrus grilled chicken and fried chicken. We wanted rice but unfortunately there were out but the upside was that the up-charge for the signature size was only $0.30. We paid less than $10 for our $20 Groupon and only ended up paying $2 afterwards. That's great because I had some food leftover to take home.  I had a three piece breast and wing combo but it only comes with one side. Additional sides are very inexpensive however. I got the Yuca fries and sweet plantains. It did take forever to come but In fairness they did say that the grilled chicken would be another 10 minutes. I was however surprised when they stop by the table to say that the fried chicken would also be an additional five minutes when we had already been waiting for about 20 minutes. It was well worth the wait though.   Aside from soft drink beverages they have what they call fresh drinks and the options are guava, Jamaica (fruit punch) and Horchata which is a traditional cinnamon and not Mexican drink. It's milky creamy and delicious. It was my first time having it but I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I had an excuse in the form of a buy-one-get-one-free coupon to stop by and try this latest addition to the chicken fastfood scene  here in Sin City which is conveniently located not too far away from where I live.  Pollo Campero is proof positive that good people and good food come from Central America, more specifically from Guatamala the original home of the flavorful and optimally spiced chicken that is cooked here.  I was able to try both the fried and grilled chicken and enjoyed them both very much. It's impossible for me to pick a favorite.  Pollo Campero has its own unique twist on the batter of its fried chicken: It's light and cooked to a perfect state of golden brown perfection.  The grilled chicken is covered with a lip-smacking combination of spices all of which enhance the overall peppery, citrus theme with the luscious taste of lime predominating.  Both varieties of chicken are moist and juicy and a pure joy to consume. The portion sizes of the clearly top-quality chicken used are by no means skimpy, irrespective of how many pieces you buy. And this is most noticeable in the delicious chicken breasts which are truly impressive in size.  I only tried two side dishes - the yucca fries and the Campero beans - and both were uniquely tasty as well as of generous size.   I especially enjoyed the beans with Pollo Campero's own blend of spices in the sauce. These are definitely not your standard baked beans! The yucca fries are a welcome, lighter and more airy variation of the ubiquitous french fries found elsewhere and are ideally consumed with some Campero sauce. No ketchup is needed here!  Service was very quick, pretty much the moment that I stepped through the door. There was a slight wait after ordering since a new batch of one of the items that I ordered was still being cooked.  All I can say is that Pollo Campero is definitely worth a visit. Everyone should come on by and check out the new kid on the block.I will definitely be returning even when a discount coupon is not available."}
{"text":"We had the most amazing experience today, we went to the drive thru and Olivia taken our order, we spoken in Spanish and she was responding in English, she taken the order perfectly but at the end we noticed that she doesn't speak spanish but she wants to learn, Olivia you are doing a great job, please keep going."}
{"text":"Awesome friend chicken. Hard to find a parking spot and the line is out the door. Had the Camparo Beans (pintos with jalapeño and spices). So good!"}
{"text":"The food here is great once you break the language barrier with the very unprofessional and rude staff they have. I ordered a 3 piece with a 1 grilled breast and 2 fried wings (and telling her that took almost 5 minutes) - when it got to my table it was ALL grilled - told her of my order so she took it back - my boyfriend went to ask for silverware just to see them bringing my order back WRONG AGAIN!!!! There's at least 4 - 5 employees just standing for food to come out and take to tables that it's just all chaos - PLEASE consider hiring english staff as well or make sure the staff you're hiring speaks ENGLISH fluently too!!!!"}
{"text":"I lived in El Salvador for a while and loved going to Pollo Campero so I was excited to see it in Vegas. We got fried chicken, beans, yuca fries and horchata. We liked all of it and would go back. I thought the chicken was crispy and delicious, the beans were excellent and the yuca fries were really good along with the dipping sauce it came with. The restaurant was clean and great staff as well."}
{"text":"1:30pm, no line. We were in and out in 15mins...boom!   Ordered the 12 piece mixed fried and grilled family meal with 3 sides(black beans, campero rice and coleslaw), a medium horchata and a chicken verde empanada to go. For all that we paid $35 and change. The fried chicken was good, not greasy. The grilled chicken was good too, a little too tangy for my taste. The pieces were small especially the teeny tiny wings. As for  the sides, I liked the campero rice the most. It went well with the chicken. The two other sides weren't as successful. The black beans was watery and salty. The coleslaw was too tangy and had too much mayo. The chicken verrde empanada had barely any meat in it, a greasy, flat disappointment. The horchata was resfreshing though. The sauces were ok too.   All in all, I don't think they lived up to the hype although the chicken was good. I don't think you get your money's worth for what you get either. I'm glad I got to try it but don't think I will be going back for more soon."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken with the rice & the plantains perfect! Also squeeze a little bit of lime on the grilled chicken it really adds to the amazing flavor it already has"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!! Just like home ! EL SALVADOR;) no other place has chicken like this!"}
{"text":"Great food! Horrible Service   I know this place is new so I expected to wait. I waited about 40 minutes inside. No staff ever came out to say anything about the wait. I had to ask a passing by waitress for a paper menu so I didnt loose my place in line.  When I got towards the front of line, I realized they had 3 registers but only one was being used. There was a swarm of employees around the food area though. There was tons of chicken ready to go, but the employees were super slow in packaging it, repeatedly checking receipts.  When I was finally able to order, I had a hard time communicating with the cashier due to language barrier.  After placing the order I waited another 15 mins for it to be packaged. The employee I guess that checks the food argued with me about the sauces. I told her my receipt says I should get 4 sauces, and she kept insisting that I pay extra. I had to get the attention of the cashier that took my order to let her know, Then she had to tell the girl in spanish. I tried to check my order but she kinda blocked me and said I had everything.  She placed my large order in a paper bag, and I asked for a handle bag and she got an attitude. When I got home I was missing items!  I have been in contact with corporate.  I really hope they improve their customer service skills as the food was good. I ordered the chicken both fried and grilled. Both were extremely juicy and well seasoned. The guava BBQ sauce was very good. The mango and jaimaica drinks were light and not too sweet. I ordered the empanadas trio which was great the crust was crispy & flaky. The cilantro chicken was the best. Hopefully, it will be better when theres not as much hype from it being new, and they get employees with better customer service skills that actually know the menu."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is so good. The grilled chicken in my opinion is just ok. The cilantro corn rice is good especially if you squeeze your lime on it. The boneless wings were pretty good. The grilled chicken rice bowl is good, not as good as Chipotle because of the cilantro lime rice and all of the add on options that Chipotle offers."}
{"text":"We drove up at 9:45 PM to see someone cutting off the drive-thru line with cones, so we decided to park and see what time the store closed. The lobby was full and there were lines at the registers. My hubby and I walked through the door at 9:46 and were greeted by an employee standing at the end of the line who told us that they were closed... hubby looked at his phone... 9:46.... then the employee said that we \"could wait in line and see if anything was left, because we shut the fryers off at 9:30\" and they close at 10 (Yes, that's exactly what he said).  *So you have a line of cars in the drive-thru AND a line at the registers, and you shut down your fryers 30 minutes before closing? So the closer you get to closing time, the longer your fried foods sit out? Doesn't sound fresh to me. I'd remember that for the next time I decide to visit late at night.... but I won't ever be coming back.  *It's your opening week and you're turning business away BEFORE your posted closing time??! Seriously??! *For the record, this employee never said anything about them running out of food. The reason he gave us was \"We close at 10.\"  Wow. I'm terribly sorry to bother you guys with our business. You did an amazing job at making us feel like we inconvenienced you."}
{"text":"Interesting fast food.  We went like a day it opened and the lines were really long, but that didn't bother me at all.  It was worth the wait.  We loved it.  We ordered fried and grilled chicken with 5 sides and all 5 sauces so we could try as much as possible.  Out total came to about $27 which is a little high for fast food, but we had enough left overs for another meal so it's not that expensive really.    The fried chicken was tasty.  Very fresh and the batter was great.  The grilled chicken was the best though especially with lime.  The fried plantains were excellent.  The rice was average.  The beans tasted a bit like chili.  The corn salad was spectacular.  The coleslaw was OK.   The place was clean.  The booths were a bit cramped.  The place is decorated nicely.  It's unusual when you dine in because they give you stoneware plates and metal silverware instead of foam containers and paper plates.  It's a nice touch.  There is plenty of parking.  The staff was helpful, but because it was opening week they were really busy.  We loved it and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Pollo Campero - North Las Vegas, NV  To Whom It May Concern,     The Fried Chicken at Pollo Campero is not good, it's fork licking amazing. I enjoyed every bite of their hand-breaded fried chicken, especially the dark meat.  Every piece was full of flavor, fully cooked (no blood), still juicy, and the breaded skin is just awesome. Pollo Campero is also known for their Citrus Grilled Chicken. That was good too. But in my opinion, the citrus kick was a bit overwhelming and took away from the chicken. Obviously, I prefer the hand-breaded fried chicken over the citrus grilled. I can't forget their plantains. I'm allergic to most fruits and willing to take a risk because they're so good. Pollo Campero easily gets 4 Stars for their food. Easy!!!  However, our dining experience wasn't the greatest. I know that the lines, both drive-thru and inside, can get a bit long. I also hear that the wait can take over 45 minutes. We knew this and arrived 10 minutes before opening. And yes, we were one of the first peeps in line. I don't have an issue with the long lines. Long lines should be expected if the food is good. I did have an issue with the fact that no one seemed prepared to handle customers in a timely manner. None of the registers were opened and ready for business when we entered the building. And since the registers or cashiers weren't ready, we all had to wait about 10 minutes to place our orders. I understand system problems. I even understand employee \"call offs\". But this wasn't a system problem and the place seemed fully staffed. That was issue #1.  Issue #2...we ordered the 8 pc mix (fried & grilled) We received 8 fried chicken pieces, missing the citrus grilled.  We questioned this and was told that there was an additional 7 minute wait for their grilled chicken. Instead of just telling us this ahead of time, Pollo Campero decided to give us a meal that we didn't order. And finally, we forgot or was never offered any sauces. We asked for a few sauces and was told that each sauce is an additional cost of $.85. Pollo Campero told us that they will not charge us this time because of the whole \"wrong order\" fiasco. Gee thanks! The sauce is good, but not worth the extra expense. Besides, it's not awesome sauce.  Overall, I enjoyed the food and wasn't impressed with the service. Will I be back? I'm pretty sure I will. I agree with Pollo Campero that their food is \"Flavor You Can't Campero\". I also agree with a lot of the Yelp reviews regarding the service. My thoughts...The Service is not Preparo. At least, not yet.  Sincerely,       Mel C."}
{"text":"Lord I'm glad this isn't a vlog! B/c I literally did the Roger Rabbit when I bit into this delicious chicken! I ordered a 2pc meal mixed, breast and wing to go. The breast fried and the wing(roasted?). They were running a special with the 2 pc for $5. Very friendly staff and very helpful. They did forget my dinner roll but Pollo Compero I do forgive you! The chicken makes up for it. I ordered a side of yuca fries and corn salad. The yuca fries? OMG! Slap yo great,great,great grandma worthy!! And the corn salad is tasty and fresh. Overall the food is so fresh to say this is a fast food spot. Fresh and delicious! I live in the neighborhood where this store is located and I anticipate the traffic in the area surrounding this joint is gonna get REAL conjested as the word spreads. As long as they stay consistent with what I ate tonight, my genie ball predicts a bright future for this Pollo Compero!!"}
{"text":"Too much hype. Waited 45 mins for cold food. Expensive and over packed. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of pollo campero.  They serve probably the best mass produced fried chicken I have had.  There is something about the batter they use that sticks to the chicken so perfectly while frying.  They also have rotisserie chicken that is seasoned to perfection.  Don't stop there though, the sides are great, beans, rice, plantains yuca and French fries.  Throw in little chicken bites, empanadas and the basically constant Groupon they have and you have a 5 star fast casual experience."}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken!!!! The fries are kinda weak, but the grilled and fries chicken is really good!! The beans are good as well. It's gonna cost you a bit more than most places so you may wanna go on payday. But this chicken isn't greasy like other places and it tastes really good"}
{"text":"We went there when it first opened.  A line to enter. Returned last week - it was disgusting.  Dirty bathrooms, dirty dining area.   The food was ok.   Will not return - sad to say.   Nothing compared to our Original Pollo Campero in Latin America."}
{"text":"So I was passing by, and my husband and I decided to try this new place, the services was super slow and it seems like the people that was there couldn't speak English, I have to repeat myself over and over, and they screwed my order at the end. I don't think that I will be back here."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time and finally got the chance to try it today. We decided to use the drive thru based on the amount of time we had and didn't have to wait long at all which was surprising (we went around five in the afternoon). I decided to get the crispy chicken bowl, horchata, and some dulce empanadas. Unfortunately they were out of yuca, but I will return for those later. Food was fresh, well seasoned, and portion sizes were appropriate. The horchata was surprisingly good, some of the best I have had since being in Vegas. If you are looking for something new to try or just want some authentic latin food, give this place a try"}
{"text":"Yummy !!! You can get it grilled or fried. It was low cost and fantastically awesome.  We found it on Groupon for a dine in special.  I believe we were the only non Hispanic families eating lunch but there were no problems ordering!   With a family of 4 and two kids under 7 we ordered the 9 piece family deal special. We should have ordered up. Over all, the kids were skeptical, but they ate a ton!   We Highly recommend the food and service!  The food:  Mixed grilled and fried chicken- both nice and juicy Cole slaw- simple and good  Fries- typically little salt  Street corn salad- a must get, mixed with different vegetables"}
{"text":"I MEAN. It's Pollo Campero you guys. The stuff of legends. People from Central America literally board planes with boxes of 20 pieces of fried chicken goodness to bring back to the States.  I've tried Pollito Campero in Guatemala, L.A. and San Francisco. Obviously nothing compares to the original but the L.A. location and this one are pretty damn fine! I've noticed on social media that there's is a lot of chatter about which U.S. location is best.  Folks, this place is legit. I came a few days after it opened. Stood in line (happily) for over an hour. The place was hella hella busy. The kids behind the registers and the manager were trying their best Tom accommodate the crowds. There were signs advertising certain promotions but when you got to the register they didn't know how to input it. They seemed Tom have run out of several sides and the fried chicken by the time I got there. The servers and manager should we're all very nice and apologetic about the service but for me I was totally cool with it. A couple of jackassses were being dumb with the manager but I get it. They were figuring things out.   The food is really really good. I mean, it's fried chicken on crack. I ordered a slaw-like side that was VERY interesting, with cucumbers and a mix of crema and mayo with, relish perhaps it was? Anywho, this place is totally worth the hype and you should definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Everything was amazeballs i order 8 piece mixed w campero rice and beans 3 empanadas with black beans side and plantains it came w 4 dinner rolls and was served in real tipic big plates from central america i loved loved it. I put all big dishes in the middle of the table so my family can help them selfs the service was fast and wonderful looks like they have improved based on older reviews i read the restroom was a little dirty can have some improvements but other than that i give this place a 5 stars so happy to have a pollo campero in vegas finally the line was fast as well no big waiting at all !!!"}
{"text":"I am from Southern California and we have El Pollo Loco and other Latin chicken shops. I like them all. I came to visit my sister in charlotte and she ordered pollo campero for lunch and I woke up to magic. Their grilled chicken, rice, and beans was so good. Everything was so flavorful. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Saw this place come up on Groupon a few times and liked what I saw.  Traffic was pretty backed up after work so I decided to grab food down here.  Was not disappointed at all.  Got the three piece fried chicken and it was excellent.  Some of the best I've had in general.  I live in Plaza Midwood so not one close for me,  but I'll make the trip again very soon to give the grilled a try.  Can't remember the last time I actually posted a review but this place earned it."}
{"text":"I don't know why I was expecting soooo much from this place lol Probably because I was comparing it to El Pollo Loco and thought it was way better. Don't get me wrong, its not bad, but not that great. The chicken had good flavor and as well as all their sides. I was just bummed they didn't have salsas, just sauces (buffalo, barbecue, pesto, etc)."}
{"text":"I'm combining the 2nd & 3rd visit on this review.  2nd visit - I walked in and dined in. I think it was Saturday midday and I paid an upcharge for white meat and still received dark meat mixed in. Alrighty. No worries.  I tried the juices and don't like any. HOWEVER, there's manzana on tap at the soda machine. It's caffeine free. Along with Root beer but they have Pepsi products.   My receipt with the green lines going through is posted. I ordered two 4 pieces with the 2 sides.  The coleslaw is not to my liking. They serve it cold with a lime base and some bell pepper pieces throughout but it's not sweet, just bland.   The rice was still divine even with the corn mixed about. The fries are exactly like any Pico Pollo I've ever enjoyed throughout the Dominican republic. Thin and slender. Done well on Saturday - overcooked and cold today (Wed July 5th @ 12:45, EST).   The manager took care of the inadvertent dark meat they gave me and I had help boxing things when it was time to go and we had leftovers. Someone as the restaurant will have to teach you how to close up the box. Yeah, honey - it's that serious. But the boxes are the BOMB as they get everything safely home. If you dine in - folks will cater to you and everyone is walking around to clean up and be helpful.   There were a few feathers on the grilled and the fried had the tallon at the end of the wings. All this aside things were consistent in taste as the first visit for the grilled AND the fried chicken isn't for me. It's bland to me and comes off like a batter you'd find on some onion rings. I used the hot sauce to help give it something.   The music sold it. Eventually BAChATa kicked in and I didn't rush to leave. Completed the survey while I was there and received an alert for 50% fried chicken July 5th/6th/7th   3rd visit - Came for the 50% and didn't realize it was fried only. Hmmmmm, I'm not a fan of the fried chicken. Ordered and the cashier had to alert me just fried. So we changed up the whole order from grilled to fried and I stressed white meat in English and Spanish. No problem.  Pulled off and reached for a fry - it was hard. Looked in the bag and noticed they're all overcooked so I wanted to return just the fries and noticed the chicken was dark and grilled. I think I have someone else's order.   Anywhoo, everyone was sweet and funny about it. So I chatted with folks. They helped me out with a picture. Got an apple soda and left with my fried white meat, empanada (that was missing in the bag) and rice this time. Yeah, I didn't trust those fries today.   Anywhoo, I'd recommend and trust things will improve so a 5 star may occur for now.... I LOVE the grilled and the flakiness of the empanada dough. It wasn't too greasy nor tasteless. It was impressive."}
{"text":"Love this Guatemala chicken...and the plantains, rice, campers beans...yummy. I also love the empanada.  Great fast food delicious. We eat there often"}
{"text":"This place has some good fried chicken! Not sure what they season it with but it's good! The empanadas are great as well. All of the sauces are great. Especially the Cilantro sauce. Eat it with any of the empanadas. But the chicken and cheese empanada is my best. I think I would give them 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that they were out of yuca when we visited. Otherwise, since the place was clean, the staff was more than helpful, and the food was great...I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my second visit that things still seem so unorganized. Signed up for the app like all the advertised signs on the door say.  5 min later go in the store and turn out they sent expired coupon. Manager made zero effort to gain a new customer. The first visit I ordered the 4 piece and requested certain pieces and offered to pay the difference to get the piece I want and they told me they could not do that and will not do that even if I pay the difference, they even asked the manager and the manager was extremely rude. Customer service is obviously not important at this company and gaining new customers. So when I get back to work I am talking to my employees town but how rude the management is in this place and the lack of respect they have for customers. I pull up the app and show my employe The app I just downloaded in the The coupon that the manager said was expired. As I start to review the coupon I realize that the coupon is not expired and does not expire until next month. The manager saw the date of the 18th but never looked at the month, unfortunately I was so upset with the situation I did not pay attention to it either. Needless to say they lost a customer and a lot of work by mouth just cause I can't even pay attention to simple basic things"}
{"text":"This place recently opened up by my house. I tried to give it a shot last night, but after 20 minutes in the drive thru with about 6 cars ahead of me, I decided to wait.   So I was able to try it today. It wasn't nearly as crowded as last night, but it was still pretty busy. Considering I studied the menu while waiting in the drive thru last night I already knew what I wanted.   I ordered a 2 piece half and half (one piece grilled one fried). Since I've never eaten here, I wanted to try both. The fried chicken was very crunchy and tasted really good. The grilled chicken was also good, but not as flavorful as I expected after reading the other reviews. I got the cilantro sauce, and the chipotle mustard, both were amazing. The coleslaw wasn't so great, I probably should've ordered a different side.   All in all it was good. I would definitely suggest going during the day when it's not so busy because it's not worth an hour wait. Oh and they charged me 25 cents for each sauce. Not a big deal, just something to keep in mind."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to visit a Pollo Campero since they arrived in Charlotte a year or two ago. I hate that I waited so long because they are cranking out some amazing Latin food!   On my first visit, we went a little crazy. I had the empanada trio and am still dreaming about those delicious dough pockets of goodness. I got one of each of the chicken fillings offered -- buffalo, verde, and chipotle. They were all amazing but verde was my favorite, hands down. Full of flavor and fresh herbs. Yum!! As if that wasn't enough food, the empanadas come with a side. I went with yucca because, well, I love yucca. Insider tip... skip the red campero sauce it comes with and ask for the green sauce (cilantro lime) instead.   Ted ordered the 4-piece chicken meal that came with two sides. We got a mix of fried and citrus grilled chicken. As good as the fried was (and that's what they're known for) I actually liked the grilled better. Ted picked fries and plantains for his sides. The fries weren't anything special. But, I loved, loved, loved the plantains! I ate most of them, truth be told.  I can't wait to go back to try out some of the other menu items like the chicken bowls and intriguing sides like the street corn salad and campero rice & beans. Oh! And the aguas frescas!"}
{"text":"Pros: - Grilled chicken tastes amazing!! They have the option of grilled or fried. They automatically give you fried, unless specified. We asked for half and half to taste both. Grilled had the most amazing citrus, herbaceous flavors. Soo good, you don't need any sauce! Fried chicken tasted like normal fried chicken.  - Empanadas! We got the trio and all of them were delicious. Gooey cheese, meat, and their respective sauces. The empanada was warm and flakey. Doesn't get any better than this!   Cons: - Sides are meh. We got rice and street corn salad. The rice was bland. The street corn salad was very herby and had this green bean that tasted like a lima bean. There wasn't much corn. The flavors were good, but the texture wasn't to my liking.  - Flan is meh. We got that for dessert because the picture looked amazing, but what we got was store bought flan.  - Sauces.  We were so excited to try the pesto and creamy cilantro, but they didn't have it. They didn't have 4 out of the 6 sauces.. We tried Chipotle Honey Mustard and Campero sauce, but they tasted like regular honey mustard and thousand island dressing. So we ended up not using either since it took away from the taste of the chicken.  End story: skip the sides and buy the grilled chicken only with a side of empanadas!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night with a Groupon and it was well worth it for the amount of food you get! We got a mix of grilled and fried chicken with yucca fried, Campero beans, Campero fried rice, and the street corn salad. The fried chicken was yummy, a bit on the greasy side but hey, it's fried chicken! The grilled chicken had a citrus marinade and was surprisingly moist - so delicious!! As for the sides, I would definitely recommend all of them except for the yucca fries. As a frequenter if Viva Chicken, I would say the yucca fries there are the best. The yucca fries here at Pollo Campero were too starchy for my taste. Overall, great service and very clean and modern atmosphere for its location. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We are in love with our new favorite chicken place - they did not have their grilled chicken the day we tried them out :( but the fried chicken was so good we didn't stay sad for long - so if you are going for the grilled chicken it might be a good idea to call first. EVERYTHING was fresh and it truly does not feel like a greasy fast food place, you get REAL plates. Everything we had we enjoyed - the plantains (fried not greasy), the beans (so flavorful), the tortilla were not those overly thick kind it was soft and a manageable size. We are definitely coming back- if you are reluctant to try them out because it might be too \"ethnic\"- seriously a small fraction more cost wise as bojangles and Kentucky (who can't compare) you are getting your money's worth going to pollo campero."}
{"text":"Didn't care for the spices on the grilled chicken and didn't like the coleslaw. They were kind enough to replace it with Spanish rice which was tasty but very dry. They don't have butter for the roll, but on a positive note the plantains were awesome! I'll try it one more time, get the fried chicken and hope I like it better."}
{"text":"Chicken is awesome.  Think El Pollo Loco but better.  Empanadas are good too.  The corn is tasty but the other sides are just ok."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time on my way home. The drive thru only had 3 cars ... looking at the menu and I was considering the 8 piece meal. I pulled up to order and I was not sure if grilled or fried, asked the employee and went with the fried. Ordered the 3 empanadas and for the sides the coleslaw and the salad. I got home and couldn't wait to try this. From the moment that I took the first bite of the chicken I was in heaven, good flavor and moist. In regards to the sides, my husband and I were not too fond of those but they were ok. Will definitely be back for the grilled!"}
{"text":"Stopped into this place on accident one day and have been coming here faithfully love the staff and the food is wonderful there always so friendly it's just really nice to have good customer service and nice people to talk to you when you're trying to get some food! Yadira and Alejandra are always friendly and smiling and I really like this place! I'm a faithful customer and just in case I didn't mention it the food is awesome! The best part is that the food is always hot and fresh!                      Thanks guys! Rhonda satisfied customer"}
{"text":"This is my favorite organic chicken restaurant in Charlotte NC. Welcome to Charlotte NC from A1A Roadside Assistance Of Charlotte Charlotte ROAD ANGELS, our best lunch place."}
{"text":"I've found yet ANOTHER way that Pollo Campero really makes my life better:  I'm rushing to get to yoga practice, but I'm starving.  I can't eat something heavy or fried or spicy as all that doesn't mix well with exercise, so I swing through the Pollo Campero drive thru and order their grilled chicken breast with the corn salad as my side and an ice water with lemon = perfect!  It's the correct food to give me immediate energy and strength but nothing that will disagree with movement and building body heat.  Thanks for being there Pollo Campero - I just love you guys!"}
{"text":"This place is fuckin great some best and most tasty dam chicken ive done had ... I love it ... Great experience  i  recommend get half grilled half fried combo...im happy as fuck  this place is lit the chicken was cooked to perfection !!and still retained a deep juicyness lovely ...just lovely"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my meal it was delicious super fast what a great addition so hour neighborhood family!"}
{"text":"They have great chicken grilled or fried! The grilled has a great coating of spices and the fried has a flavored batter. Today I walked in and they were out of chicken  but I decided to just get spicy empanadas which where sooo good I forgot they were even out of chicken!!!"}
{"text":"our first time coming here and the cashier Lupe was very welcoming. she made us taste try some of the side dishes since we couldn't decide what food to get. definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"Different places and people have different definitions of \"fast food\", but this would probably fit into most people's mold, simply because you walk in, order and get that order in some reasonable fashion (there is no real table service). For those that have been to somewhere like Showmars, the idea is similar. Place your order, get a number, get food delivered. Even the friendliness of the staff is on par.  Unfortunately, the fast part was left out, because it can take a really long time to get your food. If it was upgraded to \"fast casual\", where you place an order with someone who later brings your food, then it might be different, but it still took a really long time to get the food delivered - I mean we're talking 15-20 minutes, way too long for something that should be going most of the day. And more importantly, when delivered, half of the dishes were cold - my guess is that they were ready within a minute or two and had to wait on (something).  Luckily, those friendly staff members did bring out replacements, though it took a couple tries to get someone who understood what we wanted - while the cashiers spoke both English and Spanish, the people cleaning the tables did not seem to understand English well (and we do not do much Spanish), so it was a bit hit or miss in this regard.   The actual food, other than the wait and because of not getting certain ordered items, was not bad - but because it might be enough to warrant another trip to see how the fare. There were a few other tables that had piles of fried chicken, so that seemed to be a popular dish, perhaps it's worth a shot on another trip."}
{"text":"I really enjoy pollo campero their fried chicken is delicious with that hint of citrus and it's Krispy skin. I love the Latin flare of all their side dishes and sauces. Personally I don't care for the grilled chicken it's not as good as the fried and the yuca fries are cut to large for my taste they tend to be a bit dry. Some sides I do enjoy is their plantains of course, as well as the campero beans which have a chili like flavor, their fries aren't bad either. The rajas verdes empanada is so good. At times the service within the restaurant and drive through has been very slow and or crowded but other than that I believe there's just a cultural barrier in the customer service which I hope their getting better at. Overall I really enjoy Pollo Campero and will continue to come here I feel it's worth checking out!"}
{"text":"After growing tired of the same old fried chicken, I decided to continue my food journey down South Blvd and to Pollo Campero.  I ordered take out through the Yelp app and when I arrived the food was ready to go. Talk about easy.   I ordered a 8 piece meal, which included two sides.  I opted for the grilled chicken with rice and fries as the side.  The chicken was Peruvian style, with a mild citrus flavor that was on point. The breast pieces were large and the meat was falling off the bone.  I honestly don't think I would miss fried chicken if all chicken could be this good.  The rice was awesome too - so much so that I ignored the fries altogether."}
{"text":"Great chicken and sides tried the fried chicken this time will try the grilled next time definately recommend"}
{"text":"Really fantastic food. Line out the door at lunchtimes, deservedly so. It's that way at every Pollo Campero when it opens in any city. The Central American people all know the place.   This place just opened a couple weeks ago here in Charlotte. It is a well known restaurant based in Guatemala serving Peruvian chicken, extremely popular chain in Central America. They offer empanadas, fried chicken (not too greasy or too battered) and traditional Peruvian chicken. Traditional sides including fried yucca, beans, plantains, cilantro rice, etc.   Chicken itself is fresh and definitely up there with the best you'll find in any Peruvian style restaurant in Charlotte, which is amazing given its a fast food style place."}
{"text":"The chicken here is delicious. I prefer the grilled but the original kind is great too. The chicken has a very distinct flavor. The price is the same as any other similar fast food fried chicken restaurant. I will definitely eat Pollo Campero again."}
{"text":"While the food was decent at Pollo Campero, I was pretty displeased with the service. In the middle of us ordering, the girl at the register started talking to another employee (in Spanish, not sure what they were saying, but they were laughing) for a solid 45 seconds. I found this incredibly rude to talk to another employee in the middle of our order.  I had high hopes for Pollo Campero, as every time I drove past it, I could see cars wrapping around the drive through. I realize now it is because they have inefficient work. It took about 15-20 minutes to get it our food, which is surprising for a fast food place.  The food was decent. Everyone suggests the empanadas, which I agree are a good choice. The chicken was juicy, but the bowls were lacking some spice--pretty bland.  Overall, I will probably not be returning to Pollo Campero. El Pollo Loco is cheaper, faster, and tastier."}
{"text":"Seriously the slowest drive thru on EARTH no exaggeration. I waited 10 MINUTES... for the car in front of me to get their food. Then 25 minutes to get my food. The food is whatever. Eh. It was slimy yet satisfying ... definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Don't bother coming to this restaurant after 4pm. They always run out of grilled chicken and only have the fried chicken left over from the day.Also the good empanadas are also gone.Yuca,forget it it's gone too! What a shame management can't get it together.This happens frequently!"}
{"text":"We like the fresh Latin American style chicken, bowls, empanadas and the friendly service.  Love the buffalo chicken and dessert empanadas. Good sauces, especially creamy cilantro. Order at  the counter and hope that friendly, helpful Bridgette brings your food.  She is so welcoming and you have a great time as well as a quick and reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"Amazing. Chicken was seasoned to the bone. Cheap and the rice was great. Tried the beans second go round and man they are well done. Best 6 dollar comvo around these parts of town. Clean fast and friendly service. Gets crowded at times plan on it syring rush hours."}
{"text":"My wife and I pass this place all the time and decided to stop in on 3/31/18.  We were second in line and waited about 10 minutes for the person in front of us to finish ordering.  As we approached the counter two hispanic patrons walked up and the clerk looked at us rolled her eyes and began taking the other person's order.  The patron even told her that we were next but she still proceeded to ignore us.  Not sure if I want to consider this racist or not but the treatment was disgusting and we left.  I would not recommend this place to anyone because of the rudeness of the staff."}
{"text":"Great food, sometimes I have to wait a bit longer than I would like. Overall I recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I discovered Pollo Campero while in New Jersey.  So I was super excited when this location was built on South Blvd in my hometown.  I've dined in but prefer to go through the drive thru because well... I'm always in a hurry.    Think of it as the Spanish version of KFC BUT SO, SO MUCH BETTER!  It is fast food with an international /Hispanic touch.  I LOVE their grilled chicken meal! I usually purchase the 8 piece grilled meal that comes with two sides, rolls (or tortillas if that's your preference).  They do have fried chicken but I've never tried it.  Their grilled chicken is always so juicy and is marinated perfectly.  Think Italian herb with lime/ citrus taste.  It comes with lime wedges which makes me extra happy.  My preference for sides is always the campero rice and black beans.  I then add on a family size of yuca fries. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it!!  This food mentioned above is enough to feed 3-4 adults.    Their food is fresh and hot when served.    The wait through the drive thru is not bad, couple of minutes at most.  Their service/staff is WONDERFUL!  They are always happy to be there, diligent with the to go orders and know how to ring up your order correctly, even when you have promotional coupons or Groupons.   That last part doesn't seem like a big deal to you, but it definitely is to me.  Moreover, all of the sauces, napkins and utensils always make it in my bag without even asking.    I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place staff needs more training, also they always mess up our order for the price of the food. They need to be better at counting how many pieces of chicken. We ordered a 12 piece and only got 8. Last time we ordered an extra side of plantanes and gave us a side of corn salad. Seriously?! Worse customer service too. They never answer the phone and their corporate never gets back to you either. Last time we are coming here."}
{"text":"I went to the one on Charleston and where do I begin...it was awful..just another greasy chicken place. They were out of grilled chicken. The tortillas were so bad they were falling apart. The fries were stale and cold like they had been sitting for a long time. The beans were average. The yuca fries were ok. The only thing I could really eat was the rice. So disappointed and it wasn't cheap either. Don't waste your time or money on this place"}
{"text":"The food came out quickly and hot. The chicken was crisp and juicy. The empanadas were amazing (we had the Buffalo chicken) and the accompanying sauces were very good. Can't wait to have it again."}
{"text":"I went here because Pollo Campero was on the newspaper and was so I gave it a shot.  We went on a day where the chicken was over cooked (dark brown in color of breading).  Not just ours but everyone's.  The quality looked different from the picture in the newspaper.  Bummer...  Food was still good despite the chicken being overcooked.  I will give this place another chance but they need some improvement on cooking their chicken at this location."}
{"text":"Some of the best fried chicken I have ever tasted. I can't believe it's not from the south. Well it's from the south but way south. Like South America south.  There sides are very unique. They have your regular beans and rice and also yucca and plantains. Those two you never see them on any fast food program."}
{"text":"This place is really awesome. Watch out Popeyes and kfc, there is a better chicken in town!!!"}
{"text":"Small portion of chicken; overly seasoned and SO salty. Did not enjoy the coleslaw or corn salad. The plantains weren't bad. Only received one roll (2 meals ordered) and the sauce is tasteless. Staff was very nice and restaurant was slammed. Was hoping for something more like Pollo Tropical but not even close."}
{"text":"The chicken! I love the grilled chicken. It is amazingly flavorful. The chicken is marinated and seasoned with citrus infused herbs and spices then grilled to perfection. The white meat remains moist and juicy even days later when reheated in the oven. Yes I said \"in the oven\" unless you are at work do not be disrespectful by reheating it in the microwave. The sides are good but nothing to rave about except for the beans. The beans stand out and are my favorite. Grab a Groupon and give this place a try."}
{"text":"Whenever I travel to a city that I have never set foot in, I check out local Groupon deals. You can save a bit when you do. It also makes you discover great food and figure out where things are.   I bought two Groupons before I headed to Charlotte. One of them was for Pollo Campero.   I have been on a fried chicken kick for a bit. My eyes lit up when I found out that this place serves fried chicken. More importantly, this place also has empanadas, which is a weakness of mine.  The funny thing about both restaurants with Groupon promotions is that I had a difficult time opening the main door at both places. Perhaps not working out for nearly a week made me weak and seek nourishment. A female staff member helped open the door for me.  I had reviewed the online menu before coming here. I looked at the menu again to make sure that I had everything.  I ordered the following items: - Four pieces of chicken - half fried and half grilled with a lemon herb mix - Campero beans - Campero rice - Coleslaw - Empanada trio - Peruvia verde, chicken chipotle, and Latin buffalo - Flan  The chicken meal comes with a tortilla. It was a lot of food for $20. I went over by a dollar.   There is a waiting area in the restaurant for those who are ordering takeout. You can also dine in. Since it was my last day in Charlotte, I wanted to have dinner in my room and start packing for my morning flight out the next day.  Pollo Campero is like the Spanish version of Popeyes, but with more sides and dessert options.  The verdict? Both the fried and lemon herb chicken pieces were delicious. The meat was tender, flavourful, crispy, and juicy. So good! I could simply eat the chicken and call it good.  I loved the Campero beans and rice. They complemented the chicken beautifully.  I was not a fan of the coleslaw, though. It was supposed to be creamy, but it was a mix of that and water. I simply didn't like how it tasted.  I didn't enjoy the flan, either. I was disappointed. It was too sweet for my liking.  There was so much food that I ended up taking the empanadas on the plane and eating them there for lunch. All three flavours were amazing. I liked the spiciness in each of them. The chicken was yummy in all of them. I wish that I had ordered more of them instead of the flan.  If I am ever back in Charlotte, I would come here for more delicious chicken and empanadas. I'm so glad that I found this place on Groupon.  (145)"}
{"text":"Oh my god the flavor here is ridiculous. I mean, wow! The grilled chicken has so much tastiness! The fried chicken has amazing crunch. Both are so moist! Oh and those dipping sauces could just be eaten with a spoon. Everything was hot and fresh!The rice is flavor packed, the plantains are sweet and soft with crispy edges. It may not look like much, it's got a fast food feel, but the food here is 5 Star! The workers are super friendly too! You really need to eat here. I can't image anyone getting a bland or unimpressive meal."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times. Great chicken however SLOW service and the sides are lousy. Today's market corn salad was full of yesterdays wilted lettuce"}
{"text":"Visiting my Mother in Las Vegas and ran into this place by sheer luck.  Been back three times, best chicken ever so moist and flavorful. Next visit to my Mom's in Las Vegas I'll be back for more! I wish there was one in California!"}
{"text":"Some of the best chicken I've ever eaten! I felt like my chicken skin was a Chicharrón! It was extra crispy but also light and flaky!  Yes, I'm a chicken expert! It's a new location so I pray they keep up the good work. The plantains are so delicious! All the food was so fresh and they have great workers. They have a lot of locations so check out their site to find one near you!"}
{"text":"muy mal servicio.  cuando llegue me dieron un cupon y no lo pude usar que hasta mi proxima visita.  si van a dar cupones que lo den después qué uno paga.  la manager muy amable me iva reembolsar pero las trabajadoras no la dejaron.  nunca me ha pasado esto en ningun restaurante.  a un cliente se le trata bien para que regrese.  parecia que estaba en un mercado en latinoamérica.  Parecian vendedoras de tomates, muy corrientes.  Yo no voy a rregresar nunca.  Se ahorraron 7.00 dólares pero perdieron un cliente y conozco muchas personas que les voy a decir que no vayan a éste lugar."}
{"text":"Great food but you will have to wait for it.  This place is so popular and diverse.  If you want some authentic food -yes, I know it fast-food, come here!  Benefits to eating here: -  The food is great! -  It is generally hipster free. -  It is different! -  You can people watch. -  You can do productive things while you wait for your food.  As an example, I took a moment to write this Yelp review."}
{"text":"Food is actually descent. But service is BEYOND HORRIBLE!! They charge you for any sauces, you have to PAY for a cup if you want water. The lines have died down now that the grand opening is over with..but service is ridiculously slow with employees that are unmotivated and uncaring. (I'm sure they're getting minimum wage at best.) Restrooms are disgusting. (\"dirty dining\" candidate for the news?) Orders to go are inaccurate- no utensils or napkins in the bags.  Again, food is not bad-but overshadowed by the other factors- I now say \"no mas\""}
{"text":"Four stars only because over all pretty good and tasty, but the fried chicken choice is a little too salty, strong tasting. The grilled chicken choice is a lot better though! The seasonings taste like beer can chicken...with herbs and citrus.  Their rice is really good, the fried yuca is delicious, and the other sides are amazing. But the price is like too too high...? Their basing this off of this is the only and first Salvadorian style chicken in Vegas..thats why!"}
{"text":"Food is 4 stars service is 1. The service is slower than slow. I MEAN REALLY SLOW. Been here 3 times. Placed order online the first time and they didn't know I placed the order until I showed up and showed them my email confirmation so I had to wait an additional 20 minutes for them to make it even though I ordered 30 minutes before I showed up so I wouldn't have to wait. Almost an hour total. Other 2 times were takeout and it took 20 minutes each time for my order to be ready. How long does it take to put chicken, fries and rice in a box???"}
{"text":"It's Taco Bell.... I swear it must be fucking Taco Bell.  They have the same purple hours signs with white font, and their chicken burrito looks identical to Taco Bell's Grilled Stuft Burrito.   I wonder if their fried chicken is a knock off of KFC as well?"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Waited in the drive thru for FORTY FIVE mins... trapped... and the food was not worth that wait"}
{"text":"The magic is back! After a few more visits, I've yet to have anything less than delicious. Great job, guys!"}
{"text":"I really liked the food. The aroma of the grilled chicken was seductive and I just couldn't wait to get my hands all over those tender and juicy Latin...chicken goodness. It's the type of smell you won't mind lingering in your car.  We got a box of grilled chicken, salad, fries, and dipping sauces: pesto, and cilantro. The chicken itself is super flavorful on its own but dipping it into the sauces takes it to another level. I keep switching back and forth between the sauces we got. \"I think the pesto tastes better but let me dip in the cilantro sauce. Mmmmm...the cilantro sauce is better. What does the pesto taste again? Oh, man it's so good. Lemme try the cilantro sauce again.\" Next thing you know, both sauces are gone! Going back to the chicken...it's covered in herbs and there's a hint of citrus in there. The flesh is so juicy and tender. The Crazy Chicken should be shaking in its boots right now because this place is good.  However, you have to have about an hour of free time and loads of patience. The drive-thru line is long and does not move. We waited 20 minutes in the drive-through before deciding to park and just order in. That took another 20 minutes + more time for the food to be ready. So much chaos and not enough order and organization. This place just needs to be managed better and could learn a thing or two about expediting the entire process. We came here after dinner rush (9pm) and I think they were still just dealing with dinner rush for the past 3 hours.  I will definitely come back but not until after a month or two when they get their act together."}
{"text":"About 2 months ago, this place had noo running water for about 2 hours.. They kept thier doors open and kept on serving people ... when i asked to use the restroom they told me they were out of service, but the employees kept going in and out of them.. they kept talking in spanish asking eachother what they should do. Thats against the law, isnt it??"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what everyone is complaining about. Yes, the service leaves a lot to be desired but it's a fast casual establishment, it's not tavern on the green. If the wait times are long and the place is not running like a well oiled machine then have a conversation with management because that is who is responsible. If you go inside you can see everyone is working and moving a pace they should for a fast casual establishment, but the issue is training. They need to do more training and they need to learn how to run more efficiently.  Now let's talk about time. This is not McDonald's conveyor belt made food. Being Latino I can tell you some of their sides are being made on the spot like the plantains. Those you have to wait for.  So far, the food is great and the price is right. Both the grilled and fried chicken are like none other. Tender, seasoned just right, fresh and flavorful. You have to try the campero beans. My favorite meal is the fried chicken with campero beans, rice, and plantains. The plantains are just like my mom makes them and I could eat a ton if they let me. The serving size is perfect. The establishment is clean and convenient. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it has room for improvement."}
{"text":"My first time here was 3 days after opening. I went through the drive thru. I ordered Grilled Chicken.Our 2 sides were Yucca and Rice and then I ordered french fries as well. I should have checked the bag before I left the window. When I got home, I found the whole order was wrong. I took it back and they fixed it. I was very annoyed but didnt want to review them at that time because any new business can have a rough start. Today is black friday. I've worked all day, traffic is awful and I dont want to cook. I decide to give them another try. I went through the drive thru again. No waiting. I ordered only the grilled chicken, no sides. I asked the girl at the window to check it before I leave, she did. The Chicken was so flavorful and delicious Im certain I'll be bringing that home again. Ive had a few of the sides and they are ok but we really liked the chicken the best.   I didnt have a single problem this trip so hopefully they've worked out the new business confusion that can sometimes happen."}
{"text":"This star would be no stars because of their poor hospitality .  I recently won a voucher from the radio Q100 for a free meal . The radio was nice enough to give me a pair , for me and a date .  Upon presenting this coupon that clearly states ONE FREE PERSONAL MEAL , the rude manager Arumie kept telling me I could not use it unless i bought 2 pieces . I told her that is not what the coupon says . I am not purchasing anything because i won this from the radio , & i am already being taxed on my winnings . After going back and forth , i asked if they had a corporate & took my coupons and left .  I called the day after and spoke to another manager, Kennedy & he told to come in when he was there . When i asked the cashier for him , he walked up and did not even acknowledge me . That in itself is rude & terrible customer service yet again . He told the cashier what to ring up & walked away . No sorry , no nothing .  I will never come back to support such rude people ."}
{"text":"If you're looking for chicken with a lot of flavor go here. I loved the grilled chicken a day can't wait to try the fried."}
{"text":"Very clean establishment. Unfortunately, they continuously got my order wrong. 6 visits and only 1 order was correct. Found Pollo Royal down the street after I gave this establishment 5 more chances...I understand that we are only human, but the last straw was visit #6 when they asked if I could wait 16 minutes for fried chicken. Umm - name of the establishment is Pollo Campero...Pollo? 16 minutes to wait from a drive-thru? Not to mention when the order was messed up on my final visit, and I went up to the counter the gentleman yelled \"What do you want!?\" This was after they messed up the order...again. The manager heard him raise his voice and got up - I asked for my money back and she apologized.  -Umm, I want you to get my order right - This was after they added a 2nd meal to my order for an additional $9.00 and instead of telling them to take it off after the cashier apologized since I just ordered one meal, I paid for it anyway and said I'll just take it. My suggestion is to go to Pollo Royal to support your Latin establishments. Viva Chicken is good as well, but I'd rather support mom and pops establishments to keep our communities thriving. Damn, I tried to support you Pollo Campero..."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Grilled chicken and campero beans are great!! I also love the street corn salad and yuca fries. Mango drink leaves a little to be desired, but it was good! Still want to try the slaw, fried chicken, and dipping sauces!"}
{"text":"the first time i came i ordered 8piece all dark meat meal with fries,and beans, it was really good. tonight i came back after a month from the first time I ordered 3 piece all dark meat and fries. The only item I didn't like was the dinner roll .  I chose this option over tortillas and I regretted it . The fries were not fresh either. the flan is very small for 2.99 will not buy that ever again either. i cant even go back because it is truely a waste of money. They dont offer a drink with my meal I ordered either. Wish you luck."}
{"text":"This is the best fried chicken I've ever had! It's so crispy, moist, and flavorful. My husband got the grilled chicken wings which were amazing as well. I tried the boneless wings which were good but definitely the weakest of the three.   The sides were awesome as well. The fried plantains are my favorite -- sweet and delicious. The corn salad was also very good.   The drinks are also very good. The Jaicama and guava are my favorite but they let you sample them all before buying one.   The desert empanada was one of my favorite things. The filing almost tasted like sweet potato, but it was dulce de leche.   The prices are also incredibly cheap and you get a good amount of food. I can't wait to come back here. This will be one of my new go to lunch spots."}
{"text":"I do not eat meat on a bone...haven't in about 15 or so years now... don't eat skin either...well that all went out the door coming here! THE CHICKEN IS AMAAAAZZZZING!!!! Best chicken I have ever had. We tried the fried chicken and the grilled...both incredible. The skin was cooked to pure perfection on the fried...with the chicken super juicy on the inside still! The grilled is seasoned in a citrus marinade and the flavor went all the way through!  The meal we got was the 8 piece with 2 family sides...we had the campero bean and rice and we had the coleslaw the 1st time and the corn salad...which I would go back for on its own!  It is not what we expected when we walked in...but this is the true finger lickin good chicken restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to eat at Pollo Campero. The restaurant has a warm and inviting atmosphere and the food is way more than your average fast food chicken joint. To begin you can choose between fried chicken and grilled chicken and although the fried chicken has a great crisp and bite - the grilled chicken is phenomenal. The grilled chicken has grill marks and is flavored or spiced with several mouth watering tastes. The menu comes in the traditional breast and wing or 3-5 piece combo with sides. The sides are OK. They are not my favorite part of the menu. But I imagine that is because I do not enjoy cold sides and I would prefer corn on the cob instead of corn kernels. But the sides are really flavorful and my wife enjoys all the sides. Fries. - I think they have Yuka fries or they do not have fries all together. I really can not remember because I did not order fries which sucks as a fry lover :( That's pretty much the only down side to this whole place... they need seasoned crispy fries-   I am sure to update this review because Pollo Campero is really affordable and provides a solid stable meal."}
{"text":"Yum,  I will be back!  Especially now that I see its a lot closer to home than I anticipated!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. One word...Awesome! From the food to the customer service, even the prices are great. You leave full and happy. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Worst place to eat, Chicken is OK, SIDES ARE THE WORST. rice taste like it came out of a cereal box, beans are made with chicken fat, the salsas are chulula and gerber green sauce. never eating here again i promise pollo loce will leave you happier then this."}
{"text":"Order wrong.  Tried to contact thru website.   Watched manager take old fries out of warmer and re-cook."}
{"text":"MOVE OVER, VIVA CHICKEN!!! Pollo Campero is the chicken king!! So I'm a big rotisserie, on the grill chicken kind of girl. My husband loves fried chicken. This place is the best of both worlds! We went in and I believe that we pretty much ordered the left side of the menu because the table was overflowing with food for just 2 people.  We had to try a bit of everything and I'm so glad that we did. Fried and grilled chicken arrived at our table steaming hot. I just don't know where to begin when describing the chicken. This chicken was so juicy and flavorful, that we couldn't get enough. When it comes to fried chicken, I can honestly take it or leave it, but this fried chicken was \"hands down the best I've ever had\" according to my husband. It really was delicious. Crispy, well seasoned, not greasy and fatty at all. The grilled chicken was absolutely incredible. So much flavor in this well marinated chicken and then the char marks and smokiness just enhanced it to another level. Their chicken was so good that I would alternate between bites of grilled then fried chicken.  Delicious, crispy, crunchy, fried yucca is one of my favorite starchy carbs and it was so worth it. The pinto beans were out of this world delicious. I wanted to lick the paper bowl that they were served in. We really enjoyed their corn salad and I was quite surprised that I would. I was expecting some corn from a can and mixed with some chopped vegetables, but they proved me wrong. I adore fried plantains and that is always like a dessert for me and theirs did not disappoint. We also ordered their empanadas and it came with a choice of 3 different kinds. All three were very good and I order them again, but for us, the chicken and their side items were the stars of the show.  Don't forget to order some of their juice that they have at the counter. They have Jamaica, guava, and horchata. The Jamaica juice is basically from the hibiscus flower and tastes similar to sweet cranberry juice. The guava is so smooth and sweet. It's really great to mix the two.  You will not be disappointed and will definitely leave overstuffed as we did because the food really is that good!"}
{"text":"Im from SO FL where there are many \"Pollo\" type restaurants and wish there were MORE here in Charlotte! I saw their Tv commercial and got my son interested in the food and he is picky and 6'4\" 225lbs so wants enough food to eat where he isn't hungry again in 2 hrs. The restaurant is spotlessly clean and we hope it stays that way. The food is Peruvian, spicy type chicken but they have grilled chicken, too. They have many yummy sides...black beans, campero beans, platinos maduro, coleslaw, many others and their flan, tho different than the Cuban flan I make, is EXCELLENT...my son likes it better than mine (I think they use condensed milk in addition to all the other flan ingredients. For him to be impressed it has to be A+++. We got the EMPANADAS plates, mine with slaw,  his with Campero beans. I got a guava drink that is to die for, tho a bit pricey.  We will be eating there more soon. I miss Cuban food, and this is similar...Peruvian food has a lot more cilantro in it, but it won't keep us away. I cannot wait to try the platinos maduros. WELCOME TO CHARLOTTE, POLLO CAMPARO! Keep spreading the word via TV commercials, as I rarely go to that side of town any more and would've missed the restaurant had I not heard it on the tv."}
{"text":"So I have been here twice and all I have to say how do you not have the grilled chicken! Both times I went there after track practice around 6 pm on a weekday.  Ordered the 20 piece only grilled chicken mixed and both times said \"well it's not available right now and it will be about an HR WAIT\"!!!! What? Really one hr!! By the way they were not busy at all!!! Hate to do this review but definitely will not go there ever again! FYI my first ever YELP REVIEW!!!"}
{"text":"their fried chicken is really good. I wish they still had the cilantro sauce but they got rid of it. everything else is alright."}
{"text":"Can you say yummy in Spanish, good for you, I can't but if I could I would say it for sure. The chicken is super good and we loved the sides. We did not get the bread or wraps as promised and did not get all dark meant but it was still good. The staff really did not speak English is likely we did not get everything we asked for but even with this we like it. You might want to get a English manager so if a non Spanish speaking person does come in, you can assist. Other than that , its a hit"}
{"text":"First time here, we both had a 2 pc 1/2 and 1/2 rice and fries. Really enjoyed the crisp of the fried chicken wished the grilled chicken skin was crispy and not slimy. Rice had awesome flavor and the corn added a sweet bite. Once everything was delivered to the table I got back up to get sauces as no one asked when we ordered or when food was delivered and we forgot to ask for sauce upon ordering.  We tried the spicy, honey mustard and the cilantro and they all had amazing flavor and enjoyed them on different things.  Meal came with two tortillas steamed and rolled in a plastic bag they were a bit to soft and falling apart, the 2nd one was in pieces after the first bite. All in all we enjoyed it chicken was juicy and liked the sauces and sides we had."}
{"text":"Thought I try this place,however, there is a 30 minute wait for grilled chicken. Keep in mind this is a fast food chicken place so it's pretty ridiculous."}
{"text":"Well, we read the reviews before our first visit and we already knew that the lines are long here.  If you want to hear better news than what my fellow Yeeps have already said about service, I'm sad to report nothing much different.  We were not familiar with Pollo Campero but they're kind of a big deal around the world, with \"over 300 restaurants around the world from Costa Rica to Bahrain,\" according to their website.  This is the first location in Vegas, though, with a second one coming soon to East Las Vegas.  We figured if we came on a weekday when they opened, the lines couldn't be horrible so that's what we did last Friday.  We arrived about 9:50am, 10 minutes before opening and we were second in line:  things are looking good!  Fairly soon, other people arrived and the line was probably ten deep by the time the doors opened.  A little after 10:00am, we entered the restaurant and there was a lot of staff behind the counter, but they were still counting out the drawers.  We all stood in line watching and waiting before anyone took our orders.  Once we placed our order for an 8-piece mixed combo of the citrus-grilled chicken and hand-breaded fried chicken, plantains, and street corn salad, we sat at a booth and the food arrived fairly quickly.  However, what arrived was 8 pieces of the hand-breaded fried chicken, not a mixed combo.  We explained to the server that this is not what we wanted.  She said that there was no citrus-grilled chicken at the moment because none was prepared yet as there was only one cook in the kitchen so far.  The cashier did not inform us of this when we placed our order.  The staff member went to the kitchen to find out when the citrus-grilled chicken would be ready and she returned saying it would by 7 minutes, so we said we'd wait.  At least it only did take that long before we got the combo that we ordered.  After all that, it turned out that we LOVED the hand-breaded fried chicken!  Plus the plantains were fabulous and the corn salad was tasty, too.  Therein lies the problem right now:  we loved the food, but echo others' sentiments about service and organization.  I guess we were lucky that we didn't wait in a long line and we did get our food in a timely fashion after the confusion, but there is lots of room for improvement.  I hope it does get better because I want more of their chicken sooner than later.  Come early if you can; there wasn't a long line when we left around 11:00am."}
{"text":"I'd really like to give a higher rating but it's hard. The food is great but the service not so great. I don't blame the cashier, but it may help if you hire employees that can work under pressure and count. First off I ordered a 3 piece meal with all breast meat... and she didn't charge me extra so I went back to pay the difference... no big deal... so the difference was $3.23 and I gave her $5.25 simple math would tell you your change is $2.02 right? Well she gave me change for $5.00 which was $1.77.    It's not the food at all.. it's great and I wish you guys would open one in the Southwest..."}
{"text":"If you've never been to El P.C. and know little to nothing about it like me, then this review is for you. First of all, there are 2 types of chicken: fried and citrus grilled. The fried is by far the most popular and it is made in abundance. The grilled seems to be a rare commodity because when we ordered it they said it would take 20 minutes. It ended up taking 30 minutes to get any of our food, so unhappy face for that one.  Three registers but only one being used to take orders, hence the line is out the door. Unhappy face #2.  Place is rather chaotic and disorganized. Worse yet, the floor was covered in grease - you could practically slide on it. Pretty gross.  Despite all of this, the food is still worth trying, but I recommend being selective. The grilled chicken is quite good, juicy, and was enjoyed by all. Adding a squeeze of extra lime kicks it up another notch. Thumbs up on fried bananas and the bread. I would not bother with the rice or cole slaw - both are forgettable.   Bottom line: Best bet is to just order chicken only and use the drive through. Serve it at home with your own rice and other goodies and you'll be happy. Probably worth trying the fried chicken and the empanadas. If they add another more convenient location, then I will be back for some chicken that is an alternative to the Crazy one."}
{"text":"I don't give many one star reviews. I try to point out the good.. I understand the place is new and it really needs to fix things if it wants to last.  They are crowded. I went once and the line was super long and left. I went during the day around 4 and the drive thru had about 3 cars ahead of me. It took me about 20-30 minutes to get our food. (again expected - not holding it against them) Though the person that took my order had such a thick accent I couldn't understand most of what he said.  We ordered about $50 in food. The chicken (fried) was pretty good it was actually better then KFC and Popeyes! I would get it again. Most everything else was ehhh...  So why the one star.. Had too much food to sit at the window and check but confirmed everything was in there. One bag for everything.  Well the french fries that my son grabbed out of the bag after they gave it to us were cold, and so were the Yucan Fries.. which also were cold and not many of them. The bags looked partially full.   We were missing all the sauces that came with the side orders. Also missing two of our side orders. I live 15 minutes away so it wasn't worth the gas to drive back but very irritated. I tried to call to complain to a manager.. Phone was busy.  Got on the corporate website and complained.. Didn't hear back from anyone. (several days have gone by)  I noticed someone below made a comment about food survey on the receipt ... mine has no such thing on it. So I wonder if it is random or if they disabled it.  I will try again in a few months, hopefully they have it together by then."}
{"text":"The chicken is amazing!!!!! The rice and the beans  amazing !! Tummy is full and happy"}
{"text":"Let me start out by stating a fact. This is real finger lickin chicken. I had never even heard of this restaurant till it popped up on Yelp. I read a few of the early reviews and bookmarked this place to try. After a long hike up in the Spring Mountains this past Monday, my hubby and I stopped in.  Virtually no wait and the person serving us provided us with a mini class all about the chicken and what she preferred. I appreciated her taking the time to educate us. We ended up trying the citrus grilled breast and the fried breast. The sides chosen were \"Latin\" coleslaw and Campero beans. In addition, we ordered the Dulce de Leche empanada for dessert. We tried a couple of sauces but here is the truth. This chicken doesn't need any sauces. It is so fresh and tasty and just falls apart in your hands. It is hormone free and so juicy. I devoured the fried breast while my hubby preferred the grilled. I can see using the sauces with the chicken nuggets but that would be it for me. The sides were ok. I am still not sure what they meant about Latin coleslaw as it looked and tasted just like regular coleslaw. The beans were tasty with chorizo and cilantro but not a side I would order again. The empanada was a totally different sweet and creamy filled dessert. Served warm and the milk custard filling was just perfect. Not too sweet but definitely a highlight of the meal.   For those people who are Breaking Bad fans, I heard that this restaurant is the inspiration for Los Pollos Hermano featured in the show. Check out the logo of the chicken as the resemblance is so close.  I will definitely return to order a bucket of chicken to take home for the family but will probably cook my own sides to go with it! I hope there are plans for a southwest location as this location is a little out of the way. They truly have mastered the art of delicious chicken since being around since 1971!"}
{"text":"Went to try this place - what a disappointment. Chicken wasn't good. Chicken served was refried."}
{"text":"We decided to try the grilled chicken but did not find much citrus flavor in the chicken when compared to El Pollo Loco. Had the fries and coleslaw as sides but did not find anything special about them. I think we will try here again but go for the fried chicken that some are talking about."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Delicious and authentic... Everyone working here is Spanish-speaking... No fakery here. The flavors are bold, rich and colorful... I was overwhelmed with the menu because I simply couldn't try everything. I ordered the Half Chicken special which includes both grilled and fried Peruvian chicken and choice of two sides (plantains and beans).  I also ordered one empanada which comes with shredded chicken and your choice of sauce... I picked the Guava BBQ which was delicious. The other choices are Latin Buffalo (spicy) and Peruvian Verde (house).  I also tried a fried chicken bowl which is their Campero rice, black beans and roasted corn topped with Rajas (thin fried corn tortilla strips).  They serve Horchata, guava juice and Tamarindo to drink or Pepsi products!  The atmosphere is warm and inviting as are the staff. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you ate this chicken when you were younger and coming here to get flash back to those wonderful years, trust me that is not going to happens, I'm not saying the chicken is bad or the service is bad (by the way the screwed up my order like every single customer) but the chicken has no flavor at all, any simple local franchise it has a wayyyy much flavored chicken for half of the price, and this is a message  to the franchise owner you recipe is bad no taste at all.  Hope this help you if you are thinking to go here trust me don't waste your money please, you are going to be disappoint it"}
{"text":"So glad I found this place and ate here, I was in the mood for some good chicken and definitely found it!  The food was fresh and tasty!  We tried the fried and grilled chicken both were amazing! They were hot, juicy and tender and didn't lack any flavors!  The rice was really good along with the fried yuca and fries! Would definitely recommend you try, the service was excellent despite its an order and sit type of place.  In my personal opinion their grilled/roasted chicken is much better than Viva Chicken and their food is not as greasy as Viva Chicken."}
{"text":"Excellent food, juicy chicken. Empanadas were delicious. Great music has a Miami feeling.  The service is amazing."}
{"text":"The best chicken I've had. The fried chicken and citrus grilled or both great! The Campero beans and Campero rice are great sides. The Empanadas are a must and the Horchata tops off a great meal!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this restaurant but definitely won't be my last . Stopped by here  on a whim and tried one of their  family packs . The cashiers were friendly  and the food came out rather quickly .  Everything is really good here , but the real winner is the street corn salad ! It is so delish , super fresh and just plain yummy . I also added an empanada (verde) and we loved those too . I'm not sure the sauce that comes  with the plantains , but it's tasty  ! Just go ahead and give this place a try , you won't regret it ."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru about an hour before they closed and placed my order. We ordered the 5 piece camperitos with a side of campero rice and beans, the half chicken special with fries and campero rice, and a chicken chipotle empanada with an horchata to wash it down. By the time we got to the window to pay and get our order (almost an hour after placing our order) , they inform me they ran out of rice. At this point I was starving and wanted to get home to eat. I decided to substitute the rice for the yuca fries and call it a day. The chicken is very flavorful and I enjoyed the empanada. I was not a fan of the horchata AT ALL! Probably one of the worst I've tried. At the end of the day the food was good however, I won't be going back anytime soon. The slow service and unprofessuonalism was enough to keep me away until the hype has calmed down."}
{"text":"Pollo Campero was my favorite non-Chinese lunch spot in Shanghai----so imagine my surprise to find a location in a quirky mall in Phoenix. I ordered a chicken sandwich with fries, next time I'll go for something a little more out there. It was quite tasty...this place is definitely worth a repeat."}
{"text":"To me it's the average fried chicken with a c+ on service. Everyone seems to run around. Went when it was extremely busy though. They take your order then you sit down and when they come to bring your food they just kinda call out your order. Little wired, because what if someone ordered the same thing??"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Grilled chicken is so juicy and delicious"}
{"text":"Guava drink is unbelievably good and refreshing. Both Grilled and Fried chicken taste amazingly good, so juicy, so flavorful. The sides we ordered ( sweet plantains and Yuca Fries) are also super good! Price is very reasonable too! We came at a busy time and cashier made a mistake not passing our ticket to the kitchen, so we waited for a while. When management found out, they prepared the food and brought to us immediately and apologized over and over for their mistake. Also offered free dessert for us to take home. Things happen, it's what business owners do with the mistakes that matters! Will return and try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"My first time at this restaurant and I received exceptional service from a young man named Andy, will definitely come back because of him. The food was also excellent, I ordered the 2 pc with a side of rice and fries."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon to try his place out.  The chicken was tasty (I preferred the grilled chicken but the fried was also yummy)...the rice was good, but the black beans could be more flavorful. That dulce de leche cheesecake empanada is wayyyyy too sweet (and I love sweets!)... The staff was friendly, helpful and moved with  expediency... If I'm in the neighborhood I would definitely purchase chicken there again."}
{"text":"This place is close to my house so I've been lucky to be able to eat here pretty much whenever I want to. I'll be honest, I never realized how big a deal this place was until after the opened.  I'll start off with the good. I love the chicken,it's top notch stuff right there. I was expecting something like El Pollo Loco and I was pleasantly surprised. The other thing that blew my mind was the Empanadas. If you're doubting, or not sure what to get, get them. Get all 3, shove them in your mouth and order 3 more. After that, buy 3 and give them to me as a thank you for directing you their way.   After that though, I didn't like any of the sides, which is shocking to me, considering my major love for Latin food. I grew up eating plantains quite regularly and these just didn't do it for me. Nobody comes to a chicken place for the fries or Cole slaw. The Yuca fries are cool, but I guess the consistency just throws me off.   Overall, come here and eat the chicken and Empanadas and walk out like a boss"}
{"text":"Food was great but since they just opened the service was somewhat slow... I had to wait 20 minutes in the drive through. It was worth the wait!  The Campero Beans yummo! The plantains mmm mmm!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is go Latin America! This food is great for the soul. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went here during lunch, this week. The staff were friendly and helpful.  I ordered a two piece chicken meal (fried breast and wing) with black beans and an extra empanada. The food was really tasty...very flavorful and prepared fresh. My colleague ordered the four piece chicken meal (half fried and half grilled, along with rice). He really liked it, as well. He said he will definitely be coming back.  I'm looking forward to going back with my family. I didn't get to try the chicken bites, yucca fries, or rice, but if they are as good as the items I ordered, it should be a great experience."}
{"text":"I'm just happy there is finally locations in Vegas. It's about time. If you're Central American you know what's up. Yes, it doesn't taste the same as back home but neither did the locations in Los Angeles. This is great quality. The chicken is cooked in a pressure cooker. That's what makes it different from other chicken places. Viva Chapines! :)"}
