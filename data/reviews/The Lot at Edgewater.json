{"text":"I visited this new establishment yesterday evening with a friend. We had already perused the menu ahead of time and thought it was perhaps a little overpriced for this market.  We were drawn to the spacious bar area and several cocktail tables available for 2-4 guests.  We asked the hostess if we could sit at the cocktail tables and be served and we were told yes.  After about 15 min. of waiting and noticing that other tables were still waiting, my friend approached the hostess again and apparently we were not going to be waited on.  Several employees and what appeared to be the roving manager/owner noticed our table as well as a few others with no beverages, menus, etc., but nothing was done to accommodate us or direct us to the bar for drinks/menus.  At this point, I was ready to leave. There were no seats available at the bar and it just set a bad tone.  I understand that new places take a while to get a feel and iron out the wrinkles, but this is basic customer service.  When I approached the bartender, I recognized him from working at two other restaurant's.  To me, this is a compliment, that I remembered him and this is his craft.  He barely acknowledged the comment and was quick to dismiss it.  I made a comment about the cocktail tables not having waitstaff and he said \"we are two weeks old\", as if that should affect basic organization, customer service and accurate communication to guests!  I did not feel welcomed in this place in the least.  At the very end there was one server who asked if we needed anything.  This may have happened because other guests were walking out and they finally realized that this is not good for business or repeat business!  It was too late and we decided to head to another establishment down the road.  Funny, because we saw 3 other groups at the other place because they had left The Lot.  We get the point on the trendy look, but without good service that really doesn't matter a whole lot.  I was really hoping this would be a new regular joint for me since there aren't many places of this caliber in the area.  I just left feeling hugely disappointed and will most likely not return."}
{"text":"Meh. I've been here twice already for lunch, and I'm thinking I'm pretty much over it. They have a seemingly appealing menu, and they're trying really hard to be trendy and hip, but it doesn't do anything for them when the food is less than mediocre. The Caesar salad is blah. The dressing is a tasteless mixture of maybe milk, lemon and oil. The croutons taste like they've been sitting in a plastic Tupperware container for days. And then they top it off with \"roasted tomatoes\" which are just mushy and heavy and don't work at all on a salad. I've also had the wedge salad, which is tossed with a tasteless buttermilk dressing and tasteless prosciutto. Hey chef - add some Bleu Cheese or Gorgonzola and give that salad some flavor.   As for atmosphere, it's attractive and trendy, but they always seat us in these half-moon booths that are awkward when wanting to just sit and chat with a coworker. Also - servers are nice enough, but just really damn slow. I don't need to spend an hour and a half at your restaurant for lunch."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast there loved it. Got the short rib hash. It was amazing. The meat was cooked to perfection melt-in-your-mouth buttery smooth power packed with flavor. The potatoes were cooked perfectly. The sauce was incredible. Got a coffee as well. Wonderful Bold Flavor. Tremendous service in the bar. Stunning atmosphere with tall ceilings and big windows. Fully loaded bar specializing in whiskey with an additional cigar bar upstairs. This place is baller. Can't wait to take everyone I know here for a night out. I'll give lunch and dinner updates soon"}
{"text":"I understand this is a new business and being in restaurant management myself I am extremely forgiving. Especially when it comes to the normal kinks you have when opening a new business. One thing that I can't overlook is poor customer service. A friend and I stopped in on a busy Friday night. We really liked the bar atmosphere so we headed over that way. When noticing that the bar top was full we decided to sit a one of the cocktail tables next to the bar. I approached the hostess and told her we were sitting at one of the cocktail tables next to the bar and did we need to grab our drinks from the bar or would a server we around. She informed me that there was a server that would be over. After patiently waiting about 15 minutes we started looking around with no sign of anyone coming over to wait on us. At the same time I observe 2 other drinkless tables doing the same. Finally a server walked by and one of the other guests got her attention and asked to place a drink order. She was very polite but said she was not in that area and that they didn't have a server for the cocktail tables. The guest told her that they were, like us, told their was. She said she'd send someone over but after another ten minutes no one came. I approached the hostess and again to clarify what she told me about a server being in that area. She told me \"I must have misunderstood her\" because they didn't have one over there. I know that I heard her correctly...as did the 3 other tables that were told the same thing.  At that point we were ready to walk out. We decided to at least stay for one drink and went up to the bar to grab one. The bartender seemed really put out when we asked for a drink menu. Then my friend asked him if there were any happy hour specials going on. I don't think that was an unusual question. He made it very clear he was annoyed by that question and acted all arrogant and made the extremely rude and inappropriate comment \"this ain't TGI Friday's\".  I was so taken back and appalled by his attitude! It was if he was trying to say that \"upscale\" restaurants would never have happy hour specials and we should have known that. Meanwhile..I've traveled the world and been to plenty of establishments that would make this \"upscale\" restaurant look like a casual dining restaurant...and they have had drink specials at happy hour. We didn't even care if they did or didn't...we were just inquiring if they did and were made to feel like we were fools for asking! Needless to say...we left after our drink and went somewhere else. I also observed several of the guests sitting in the cocktail area get up and leave because they were frustrated that they couldn't get a drink. Good friendly service can make or break an establishment.  I would never return to a place after being treated so rudely. It's a shame because I loved the set up of the bar and it looks like they have a great patio too! Oh well!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty good. Food tasted great. It came relatively fast during a rush. The waitress was extremely attentive and well trained. I heard that this was a new, hot joint so I figured I had to check it out. For the most part, I was impressed. However, there was a woman at the hostess stand named Hannah (I think) who was extremely rude and short with us. The people at your hostess stand really set the vibe for the rest of the meal so this was extremely disappointing. Had to take away 2 stars. I'd recommend a more friendly head of house. Probably will visit again though. :/"}
{"text":"My family and I went for Father's Day brunch and the food was great. Their potatoes are amazing, supposedly there is garlic in the potatoes but couldn't taste it........they did not need it. I ordered the avocado toast with a fried egg on top. Visually it was as good as it tastes, hard to eat but very good. I ended up using a knife and fork after fighting the avocado to stay under the egg. We also ordered the thin and crispy pancakes with fresh fruit and real maple syrup, very good as well. My only complaint is the wait, they seated us at 10:45 am and we didn't get our food until 11:50. Not to mention in that hour and five minutes my coffee cup was only filled twice and I had to track down the waitress both times. She was very nice and friendly but didn't pay us much attention until we started to get hangry.  Overall good and I will definitely give it another try."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here and couldn't have left any more disappointed. From the time we walked in everything was disorganized, none of the staff knew what was going on. We never got water after asking three times. The food was the worst part. Order a steak medium rare and it came out well done and tough. The quality of meat was very low. My wife's came out cold. When our server asked how it was we told them and she just said ok enjoy and walked away. I will never come back here and urge that you don't either."}
{"text":"Let me start by stating that I have traveled the world and dined at countless places from greasy-spoon Mom & Pop's to the finest 5 Star establishments in NYC, Paris, London, Sydney, L.A., etc. and well... Pittsburgh.  I'm actually being liberal with my 2 stars because I allow for some forgiveness being that this restaurant is fairly new and probably working out some kinks.  1) Called in to check the wait time and hostess snapped at us when we asked if we could put our name in for call ahead, \"I'm not going to take your name - I'll take it when you get here.\" (said with a REAL attitude) 2) Upon arriving was looked up and down by hostess (young lady with buzzed, short dark hair). When I asked for the wait time, again with attitude she told me 30 minutes and gave me a dirty look as if that was a long time and she wanted to turn away our business. NOT GOOD! 3) Decided to sit and dine at the bar with two friends. Our first round of drinks were just okay, but for $10 - $12 for a cocktail expectation is that they will at least taste good. Like, how do you mess up a skinny margarita with premium tequila? 4) Salad & main courses came out separately for all 3 of us. In fact, my two friends were almost done with their dinner before I got mine. 5) The Caesar salad was just plain gross. The brussels sprouts were undercooked and like eating raw with a tiny bit of char. The linguini was odd and small portion for an entree. Again, with the prices being comparable to a much finer restaurant, we expected more. 6) The braised short rib entree was delicious, but don't expect your typical shredded/pulled meat - these are actual cubed rib meat. 7) Swordfish atop risotto was also amazingly good. 8) My friend who is a huge gin drinker wanted to try a new gin, but the bartender struggled to find a list, offer suggestions and/or even bring a few bottles over. He was lost. Another clearly, more tenured bartender stepped in and made it right by finding the list and also letting us taste two different gins - of which we then ordered 2 more drinks for a nightcap.  And finally, when the bill came it was $146 for 2 of us and the bartender actually charged  $0.93 cents for \"margarita mix\" after already charging for the top-shelf tequila that I requested. Really??? Tacky...  All this being said, I hope the place does well and works out some of its issues, but being rude and not being welcomed with a warm smile and good attitude is inexcusable... especially in a small community like Oakmont/Verona."}
{"text":"The breakfast was great and it's nice that they are open super early in the morning.  It was a great way to get our day started.  I recommend trying their homemade English muffins.  They were really tasty with butter and jam."}
{"text":"We hit up The Lot on a Sunday Morning Early.  Like Early 8:30 am early.  There was a few people there, employees outnumbered patrons.  The space itself is pretty neat. Minimal and hipster.  There is a nice sitting area for coffee and chatting.    The breakfast and lunch menu are pretty interesting (avacado toast to egg plates) and reasonably priced.  We had a typical egg breakfast and Belgian waffles.  The egg plate was stellar and the waffles were interesting.  The flavor of the batter was great, but the texture was a little too cracker-y.  Our service was great, Elijah was on it.  Not overbearing, but personable and fun.  I want to check it out for lunch. (and smoke some cigars in the cigar bar)"}
{"text":"Amazing! If you go for dinner, order the scallops as an appetizer to share with 2-4 people. They are perfectly cooked and sit on top of butternut squash purée. Topped with pomegranate seeds and kale chips.   For vegetarians/vegans/anybody the charred cabbage and cauliflower entree is seasoned well and comes together like you wouldn't believe. I'm so glad The Lot is here!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize this was a newer place, I figured I'd just never heard of it before as I'm not often in the Oakmont area.  But I'm glad I found it thanks to a yelp nearby search after a morning hike.  I walked in and was immediately seated.  I got there a little on the early side for brunch and stayed for about an hour so it was busier when I left.  The menu offers a variety of options.  I went with the egg white omelet that came with a side salad.  My server commented that I was going healthy today but I told her I wasn't done.  I also ordered a side of bacon.  And then went back to healthy with a side of mixed berries.  They have a nice looking coffee and cocktail menu but I just went with water and regular coffee.    The interior is very open and bright, especially on the sunny day I was there.  The tables are cozy so you might want to settle in for a bit.  There was not a long wait for my food and I thought the prices were reasonable even though it felt a bit more upscale.  Highly recommended for brunch."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with two others this weekend.  We started with soup and salad.  Very possibly the worst caesar salad I have ever eaten  It was simply terrible on every level.   The butternut squash bisque came out as more of a soup consistency and weirdly had pomegranate seeds hiding at the bottom.  It was strange and not good.   For a main course we tried the Lamb Chops and the Veal with a side of Brussel sprouts.  All three of these were done very well and we enjoyed them immensely.  The service was fair to poor as our server was not particularly attentive.   I will go back and give the steaks a shot as well as the Cigar Bar which was very crowded and very smokey (fix the air cleaners) when I took a peak."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have a new dining option with healthy choices for breakfast! The menu has some unique options which made it hard to choose, so I picked 2 things.  They have a great selection of specialty toasts! I had the ricotta toast with roasted beets, oranges, arugula, pistachios and honey.  The flavor was great, but the bread was not toasted enough and got soggy real fast. I also had the açaí bowl which also had great flavor, but the purée was very thin which had more of a soup like consistency.  The house made granola was exceptional.  My husband had the Kalbi steak and eggs. The portion size was small for the price, but exceptional flavor.  I cannot wait to try lunch and dinner.  The prices for dinner are on the high side, so a special occasion for sure."}
{"text":"Really nice space with outstanding food. I went with a buddy opening weekend and we were seated quickly and the service was fast and friendly. I got the pork chop which was as tender as you would ever hope for, and my friend got a filet which in all honesty was as good as what you'd get from a Hyde Park etc. We went upstairs afterwards and had a cigar afterwards and the selection is great as well as a great atmosphere. Really cool spot and fun experience."}
{"text":"Love this place ! I must say I'm a regular oakmont diner and I absolutely fell in love . The food was amazing (scallops, mussels, calamari, Brussels , etc) out of this world ! Our server , Elijah, was super helpful with my questions and very attentive . We sat on the patio so the atmosphere was nice and calming . The manager made a point to pop out and say hello which was great , thanks Molly! We finished the night in the cigar room with some dessert and the bartender was extremely knowledge about which wines or cigars we should try . Love this place , will be back !"}
{"text":"My overall experience was quite pleasant, however you would think the minute you walk into a very chic and new restaurant a pleasant hostess would greet you. Sadly that was not the case for me.   My family and I wanted to celebrate my mother's 60th birthday so we came here for breakfast, and when we walked in we were not acknowledged or felt a warm atmosphere from the hostess. I believe she was young in college, but obviously lacking with people skills. I was quite disappointed because as a hostess you are the first person guests interact with, and sadly it was poor.   However despite that very disappointing interaction and feeling brushed off, the rest of my experience was phenomenal.   The food was astounding and my family cannot praise it enough. I had had the Kalbi steak and eggs, and it was a perfect blend of traditional eggs with a twist of Asian cuisine. My husband decided to go with the Marty Jannetty breakfast and it is a great value with all sorts of variety for only 9 dollars. My two kids decided to the have the pancakes and they were delighted and happy as can be. My mother had the short rib hash, and she enjoyed the savory but filling entree. The meat was very tender and she enjoyed every bite she claims. It was quite the special birthday breakfast for her.   Besides the bad experience with the hostess, the rest of the employees were very nice. My waitress was very attentive to my family's requests. She claimed she was new, but I didn't believe so with her great skills on serving us.   For the 1st time coming to the Lot, it was quite good. The decor is chic and clean cut, and I really enjoyed my meal. I highly recommend visiting once to enjoy a nice Sunday breakfast with the family, but hopefully you will get a much more pleasant hostess."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised !  The waiters were attentive, the food was exceptional! Lamb chops and mussels were very good and the deserts were out of this world. They had a great selection of craft beer and we stopped in upstairs in the cigar bar for an after dinner cocktail. Perfect evening!"}
{"text":"I got the egg white omelette with side salad, and coffee. My favorite part was that it was a  clean and  new, contemporary setting. Only reason for not 5 stars was that I believe my meal was $10-12 dollars and it was fairly tiny .  Luckily, right now I am on a lower carb diet and this worked..but if I was being my same fat self I would have been sad at the lack of food for the price.  Lol i know places have every right to charge whatever they want, but they could have given more for the money. Eggs and salad are dirt cheap. I would go back for a fancy but SMALL meal ?"}
{"text":"Newly opened upscale American diner.  The decoration was chic.  We ordered shrimp cocktail it was a Jumbo size shrimps.   I ordered the iceberg salad, it was soooooo good.  The surprise element was the poppadew pepper (not sure if I spell it right) and we love it.  My fiancé hate pepper and he loved those little ones.  He ordered the clam chowder, he said it was the best he ever had.    We could just be satisfied with just those 2 courses, but when the lamb chops were out, it was amazing.  It didn't taste the game from the lamb, the twice fried potatoes was a great add on the entree.  I had the braised short ribs, it was great as well.  Maybe just a tad too much fried onion, but the onion was a great on its own.     We noticed that the other reviewers didn't give this spot high review, which we were surprised since the food was very good, environment was chic, service is top notch.   We thought the food is 4.5 stars but our server Scott makes the experience to the 5.  Timing was impeccable, attentive to our drinks, follow up after a few bites, notice right away if our drinks need to refresh.  Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Loved it! Egg white omelette was excellent!!!! Watch out Pamela's the pancakes are just as good and the fresh maple syrup was delicious. Also highly recommend the Bloody Mary!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was a little slow, but it was very busy.  I had a burger that done to Perfection.    Sat outside, great visit."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for breakfast as it just recently opened. I will say it really is a nice place, staff seemed very friendly and excited to be working there. Now for what's important, the food... Two of us ordered Pancakes one with a side of fruit and the third person ordered eggs over with the \"bacon steak\". I must say this restaurant has out done themselves. This was the first time in my life i actually needed to use a fork and knife to eat pancakes. Normally for anyone who's eaten pancakes before know they can be cut with just the fork themselves, so just wow for that point alone. What was even better was watching the table across from me eating the pancake like it was a slice of pizza, it should go with out saying, but i would not recommend the pancakes. The plus side was the Fruit was fresh! The third dinner who ordered the eggs and bacon enjoyed their meal, but did admit the bacon was too thick. They described it as thick bacon but really it's just pork belly. It was good but definitely not what one thinks of as bacon for breakfast. I was willing to come back and try lunch or dinner, but was turned off by the fact that they had CNN on the TV. If your gonna have the TV on, the local news would suffice. I don't need to be aggravated while eating my Sunday breakfast. I do wish the owners all the best, but i for one will not be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast/brunch spot!  Very polished and upscale feel inside, but prices for the breakfast/brunch/lunch menu were quite reasonable.  Lots of TVs - probably too many for this style of restaurant, in my opinion - but otherwise great atmosphere.  Service is excellent - our server was very friendly, attentive, and thoughtful.  She even offered us coffee to go after bringing the check!  I got the build-your-own omelette with bacon tomato and cheddar - eggs were perfectly done and bacon was diced thick and crispy.  My wife got the salmon toast and açaí bowl - the salmon toast was good but had an oil drizzled on it that we felt was unnecessary.  The açaí bowl was very good, with fruits and granola, made me wish I had gotten it myself.  We both had decaf coffee and it was exceptional, considering that we are both decaf drinkers who normally have a very hard time finding decent decaf in restaurants.  They seem to have a very nicely stocked bar and we're looking forward to sampling it sometime soon, along with their dinner menu.  Since this place is within walking distance from our house in Verona, I'm sure we'll be making many more trips back here.  Great addition to the Oakmont-Verona area!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food was fantastic. I can't wait to go back.  It's now my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a 1 Star review over my meal, but it was just one aspect of it that I hated. Other than this one aspect, everything is really good at The Lot. The coffee was delicious, the eggs were done perfect and the potatoes on the side were seasoned real good...  Now, that one bad thing. I got the steak and eggs breakfast. The \"Steak\" is not real Steak, it is roast beef. The \"Steak\" was marinated in something (sorry don't remember what, went here a month ago now), maybe even marinated too long. I just couldn't believe that I paid Steak and egg prices for marinated roast beef and eggs."}
{"text":"Looking for something new in the Oakmont area. Found a great place with the Lot. Moderate wait but worth it. Waitress Kelly really knows her craft. The food was outstanding. Short ribs were delicious and presented very well. Salmon was also delicious. The cheese cake was spectacular. Almost a creme brûlée. A great date night with the wife."}
{"text":"Very cool spot for brunch, with nice outdoor seating. Close to water but not in sight. Delicious cappuccinos. I got the açaí bowl, and it was very good. Boyfriend got the omelet with fresh fruit and enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"Love the cigar bar!   I compare this to several nice, upscale cigar bars I have been to.  The servers are awesome.   Great bourbon and cigar selection!   I don't eat while here so can't rate the food (Although I have had risotto and peas - both were good)."}
{"text":"Fantastic Brunch!! The standouts: Crispy Pancakes with fresh berries (AMAZING), homemade jam and whipped butter, and bacon steak. If your brunch incorporates those elements, you will leave very happy. Great service, ambiance, portion size, and value for the price. Looks like it would be fun at night with the beautiful bar."}
