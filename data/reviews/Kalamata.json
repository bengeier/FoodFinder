{"text":"This place is a bit out of the way although there is a streetcar stop right in front. The decor is nice and seems relatively new. The servers were pleasant and treated us as if we were regulars which was nice.   The food tasted as good as any Greek food I've had in Toronto. Nothing blew my mind, but the calamari were tender, the chicken well seasoned, and the spanikopita was crispy and tasty.   If I were in the neighbourhood I would go back to Kalamata but I wouldn't make a special trip out there."}
{"text":"This place is just your regular Greek sit-down restaurant. The problem is that the decor is so nice that you expect you'll get better than OK food and when it doesn't happen it's a bit disappointing. Nonetheless .. it's not bad, just nothing special. I had a chicken souvlaki platter and a shrimp appetizer."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times as it's close to our house.  It is a little gem! Excellent food (both brunch and dinner is great), great friendly staff, and is kid friendly. I hope other Long Brancher's check this place out & support it, you won't  be disappointed, I promise!"}
{"text":"So I returned dining once again with my friend that lives in the area. First I ordered the pasta casserole thing - sorry I'm unable to remember what is was called - however, I do remember that it described it as a pasta casserole with bechemal sauce, cheese and mushroom (I believe). This is not what came though, it was layered with pasta sauce, no bechemal in sight...I would have just eaten it as it still looked really good BUT I'm allergic to tomatoes... I flagged down the waitress and informed her of this problem, she seemed a little perturbed but asked me what I would like instead so I ordered by backup the Gyro dinner. This was very good although they oddly garnished dried oregano around the plate - it was easily brushed off. The Gyro was authentic and yummy. My friend ordered the fettecini (sp?) dish which she really enjoyed. I had wanted a salad as it came with the first dish but not with the second so I ordered one to take home ($8!!) while it was large, she apparently forgot about my tomato allergy and it showed up in the salad. Luckily it didn't seep into anything so I was able to pick them out and still TRY to eat it, however it was just basically olive oil over salad which I was NOT impressed with.  I didn't want to eat anymore but for $8 I took it home with me that night and when I was bringing it to my car the oil leaked on my mocassins :(!! Even though there was some mishaps the food is still killer, while not as cheap as lunch you still are full when you leave from a dinner there. I'll go back again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Country style ambiance, open concept (could be a little loud) with a good size patio. Wine list is pretty good with some Greek wines to choose from. Menu is fairly diverse. I tried the grilled Quail which was well prepared but a little dry. Vegetables and rice were done well. My GF had souvlaki and she said it was very tastey and well done. Prices were reasonable with wine and two meals (no dessert $60 including tip).  Staff are welcoming and attentive. I'd have no issue going back or recommending it!"}
{"text":"I went to Kalamata this past Friday with a group of friends and I didn't know what to expect for Etobicoke. Parking was super easy to find rather than trolling for spaces dt. The interior of the space was much nicer than the outside. I find some places far too dark, but it had the right amount of dimness.  I skimmed the menu and it had typical the greek resto dishes with a few other fish and steak dishes. For vegetarians, they offered about several mains. I played it safe and order the chicken souvlaki, price: $14 - about several large chicken pieces accompanied with salad/rice and potatoes, and grilled veggies. (I actually arrived a bit late, so my buddies ordered before me)  We shared a tapenade with some flat bread and it was savoury, salty, olive deliciousness with a hint of spice. Our mains arrived shortly after. And they also arrived a bit mixed up and missing some sides. I\"m sure the server was very new or flustered, but a friendly guy. As I arrived late, I expected my dish to come later, but it arrived the same time as the others. One of my friends received their dish later. Back to the souvlaki, the chicken was tender and moist, and the salad good, not over dressed, the veggies were cooked well too. As mentioned before, the server was a bit flustered and he told us he forgot to charge us for one of the souvlaki dishes. Despite the mix ups, the food and portion size was great. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We found out about Kalamata through a Groupon deal. The place actually looks really nice and is a pleasant surprise for this stretch of Etobicoke Lake Shore.   I ordered the dip trio sampler: taramasalatas, tirokafteri, humus with flat bread. The tirokafteri (feta, ricotta, extra virgin olive oil, garlic, chili pepper and yogurt) and the humus were delicious. the taramosalata was ok but had too much potato and was more of a thick paste because of it. There were so many tasty things on the menu it took a while to decide but I ended up going with the stuffed peppers. Fantastic. It comes with a \"Greek salad,\" which surpsingly for a Greek restaurant had lettuce (when did Greek salad decide to hook up with lettuce?).   The service was friendly an quick. The waitress was by herself but we were attended to very quickly and without fuss.   To complete the ambiance, there was tranquil greek music playing in the background.  Kalamata is definately worth the drip down to this corner of Etobicoke,"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I was craving Greek cuisine. We happened to be at her end at Rexdale. After reading reviews on this place, we decided to give this a visit this past Sunday. I'm not from the area but it's really dead in the area (lots of old people, guess people eat at home Sundays). We had an early dinner around 5pm and there's literally nobody on the street other than joggers. This is a hidden gem!   Service was amazing, could be that it was only 30% full capacity but we loved our waitress. She made some good suggestions and made sure to check on us constantly.   We ordered dip (don't remember but was delicious), Saganaki, grill whole sea bass, lamb souvlaki (medium-rare, didn't taste dry), deep fried cheese cake, 2 coffee and 3 Greek beers. Good presentation of dessert. They were all delicious!   Overall, we enjoyed our quiet Sunday dinner. Price was reasonable cause it all came out to be about $88. My girlfriend wasn't disgusted and enjoyed it. Which means a great deal, since she isn't easily pleased."}
{"text":"I should preface this review by stating that I'm not a big fan of Greek food begin with. Clearly I've never had Greek food this well crafted and authentic. It's a great atmosphere with an equally great staff and large enough that you could easily take a big crowd for dinner."}
{"text":"I have had a couple of outstanding meals here and a couple of meals that were good but nothing memorable.  Overall I give it 4 stars. The good meals are good enough to make me go back and the outstanding meals were WOW."}
{"text":"I got a Groupon for this place as I was looking for an alternative to Mr.Greek out here in Etobicoke.  First of the area of this location sucks to the point that it depresses me. It's like you're out in the dessert somewhere, or like 2012 has come and you are one of the last ones to get the news.  The service was sloooowww, like a turtle could have cooked,served and fed my meal to me in less time. Which is even more disappointing when there is 4 people in total including me and my companion. The meat was dry and bland, and the salad? The iceberg was straight out of the freezer, which will cost me a dentist appointment sooner than anticipated.  Gets a star for decor which included a fire place."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their souvlaki pita. The chicken is well seasoned and tender. I love the Greek dressing but sometimes they're a bit heavy with it. Their tzaziki is awesome. AND very well priced at $8. My reason for the three star rating is they do not offer the chicken souvlaki pita on their dinner menu and refuse to serve it after 3pm. The alternative is the souvlaki plate at twice the price. Very frustrating."}
{"text":"I ate here with a large group of family, so I got to try many menu items.  (that's the best way to eat, isn't it?)  Everything was good!  Portions were generous so there was plenty to share.  The decor is very nice.  This place would be fine for either casual or semi-upscale outings.  The young man waiting on our table was very friendly and competent.  Our only complaint was that the rice and potatoes were on the salty side.  They were perfectly cooked and delicious, but if you like your food less salty, it'll be a bit much."}
{"text":"I went there today for lunch.  It's a very nice space, large, open, tastefully decorated, with a med sized patio.  I was one of 5 tables being served, which was sad to see as the food was very good and reasonably priced.  A chicken souvlaki plate for example is $9.  I had Greek salad, rice, tzatziki and it was very tasty, despite their Greek salad mainly consisting of lettuce with a small slice of tomato and cucumber.  Please, please, let lettuce be served in every other salad out there and leave it out of Greek salads:(  I will certainly go back and try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"Greek in the West end?  I knew we probably should have stuck with the Danforth.  Had dinner with a friend at Kalamata.  The restaurant wasn't too busy on a Wednesday night.  When we came in, there was no greeter so we assumed it was anywhere seating.  One lone waiter finally came out as we were sitting down.  I ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner ($14) which surprisingly did not come with salad.  There was an option of swapping the potatoes and rice for salad but I'm greedy with my starches and ordered the Greek salad ($8) seperately.  DC also ordered the chicken souvlaki with hummus ($5) to start.  Appetizers took a long time to arrive at the table.  We weren't in a rush by any means but wouldn't something like hummus and salad be in the fridge and ready to go upon ordering?  I was disappointed with my salad.  I don't eat iceberg lettuce that often but I will make an exception for it in Greek salad.  This salad had hard pieces of Romaine and an olive oil dressing.  I missed that tanginess of Greek vinaigrette that most places serve.  A little bit of a wait for the mains but they arrived hot.  A generous kabob of grilled chicken (not bad), very dry pile of rice, 2 small potatoes (decent), some sautéed vegetables (carrot and zucchini slices) and small portion of tzatziki.  The entire meal with sprinkled with dry thyme, which I found unappetizing.  Sad to say, I've had better Greek food in mall food courts.  Service was just meh.  We had to ask to see the wine list when it wasn't delivered with the menus.  Our waiter did get all the special requests right for my gluten-free DC.  I'd pass on coming back."}
