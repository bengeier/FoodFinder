{"text":"Food with no taste. My suggestion to the chef: at least use a little salt next time!

All the dishes I sampled (from other family members) were really very bland. I think they may be counting on the fact you are drunk by the time your meal arrives. Nice beer though... if you are planning to go, just drink as much as you can and try to get drunk before your meal arrives... that way you wont notice"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer
Excellent food
Ok service

The French style pizzas, the poutines and the sausages are noteworthy of repeat visits

Summertime the patio is quite nice overlooking at the happy crowd heading to watch a movie but when the outside is not an option the inside is quite nice and cozy. The decoration is nice and accentuated by the equipment they use to brew their own award winning beers. 
The sacks of wheat is a nice touch to show off that they do indeed make their own beer but also gives the interior character

Definitely a place worth trying with family and friends"}
{"text":"Second time at the 3 brewers tonight and we came for a surprise birthday. I had a good experience last time, but today was even better despite it being a busier night. We had great service, awesome food, and very courteous waitresses! 

I can't remember what everyone got but we mostly got burgers, flatbreads, and wings. The birthday boy and a friend shared the board of beer (sorry I don't remember the exact name lol). 

I had the Texan burger which was delicious and I tried one of the popcorn shrimp which was even more delicious. Seriously, if you're going to watch a game here, grab a few drinks and these fried shrimp and you're set! Two friends tried out their new Poutine Burger and said it was mediocre and less than what they expected. Their vegetarian pizza was said to be good, as well! 

For dessert, our waitress brought out a piece of New York style cheesecake for the birthday boy and we all had a piece. I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake and this one was very rich so it wasn't really my cup of tea but if you like cheesecake, you'd love it :)

Overall, awesome experience. Recommend."}
{"text":"I came to 3 Brewers for one of the jays game about 2-3 weeks ago with a large group of my friends, we had a table with about 10 people. During our time there we unfortunately got seated in a section with the most miserable and unfriendly server that I have ever come across in my life. I've been to 3B many times before - great food, great service, a lot of friendly faces and great management. But this time we were seated with NIKITA who absolutely ruined our entire night with the lack of friendliness and annoyance she showed against our group of friends regardless of the amount of money we spent/ how much we tipped her at the end. As a person with over 5+ years in the hospitality industry I've learned the importance of costumer service and how your server can influence your night negatively regardless of how good the food is. There was no point in time during the night where she had a smile on her face or made us feel welcome. Our group actually felt uncomfortable ordering through out the night due to the sour attitude she reflected on us for no reason. I would understand if we were complaining and being needy with our orders but I can honestly say that we were a fair group and very easy to deal with. I have never felt the need to write a review on Yelp about a restaurant - even where the food is absolute garbage. But I thought it was necessary to write this review to express my disappointment over a restaurant that I've loved going to since it opened up at east beaver creek. Overall, I love 3B (especially the beer!!) and I wish to return, however I hope that my experience will be much better next time based on costumer service."}
{"text":"Solid poutine, and the classic et cetera tasters is good for those looking to try different beers without having to commit to a full pint!"}
{"text":"My family and I were just in the Richmond hill location. Horrible service, I ordered my daughter chicken fingers from the kids menu right away because she was hungry. I always check the food when brought out, and thank g-d I did because brought it out and it was cold and flat out RAW. If a restaurant cannot get \"chicken fingers\" on the kids menu right then obviously they are not going to do well. And plus, at that point I Spoke to the manager and his additide was so rude, hello you could have food poisoned my daughter!!! Did not even apologize! Think twice about going to the food joint!"}
{"text":"Place was great, really spacious and clean.  There were lots of seats, and the lighting was nice, with music in the background and sports playing.  The waiters were extremely friendly and popped up constantly to make sure if everything was okay, but they weren't a bother at all.  The food came in larger servings and everything was delicious.  There were free beer samples when we came in, and we ordered another three drinks, which were all pretty satisfying as well.  The prices aren't too bad, and it's all worth it.  The location was great, since it was in an area with lots of other restaurants, and many people around."}
{"text":"I went here two nights ago for a couple drinks and to catch up with a friend, it wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. The decor is very chain restauranty - someone's idea of what a brewery/restaurat should look like. I had the white beer which was fine and the LA wrap which was chicken/veggie and I substitued salad for the fries. My friend had an Italian pizza thing which was gigantic and actually pretty good. Nothing to write home about but I wouldn't mind popping in there again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"A decent place with a nice selection of beers. Busy on a Saturday night, but not too crowded.

I've tried their salmon salad and some of their appetizers. For bar food, I have to say it is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Great beers, food and service. Zoe, our server was awesome. She recommended  the pork shank which was unbelievable. A bit noisy but it's a brewery so it's expected. We will be back there again before we leave town for the nachos which looked incredible as they passed our table."}
{"text":"Food took awhile to come, but it was pretty good.

Our server however was extremely rude. She scoffed at my friend when they asked \"what do you recommend.\" The tone of her voice whenever she decided to come by (not very often) was rude. When we asked for the bill, she tossed the bill on our table! Not impressed."}
{"text":"Best location for 3 brewers ever.  Service was amazing,  waitresses were quite pretty.  Food was good and came in timely fashion.  Loved their beer selection.  Would definitely visit more often."}
{"text":"My first time there, as well as most of my co workers, we all agreed that the food was good. Some of us tried their beer, is good but a bit colder for sure would've been better. Good taste though.
Is a big restaurant and the decor was different, I will definitely bring more people here."}
{"text":"This pub was disastrous.... the food was average, the beer was terrible, and the service was the worst. Everything that everyone else has said thus far is true which is a shame because they really have a wonderful location with three enormous floors of dining area."}
{"text":"Food was good. The food and beer pairings were interesting. Totally a place to go if you want to enjoy some micro-brewed beer."}
{"text":"Nice spot. Popped in for a quiet lunch at the bar- good IPA, decent food but most notable for the great and friendly service. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Beer choice was great , they brew their own.
Service and reception excellent .  
Manager Lady was superb and accepted comments on food nicely. 
Had mussels pot which great but needed extra garlic and more wine .
White beer was great ."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I tried The 3 Brewers on a Friday night back in April. 

The restaurant layout is a little confusing with the different dining areas on different levels. (It's not suitable for those with bad knees.) But the ambiance was nice as it was a busy night and the decor is rustic;  it looks and feels like a typical pub in downtown.

Whenever I go to a pub (especially in downtown), I'm expecting decent pub food to go with my beer. The star platters we ordered for sharing were not bad, but my Philly cheesesteak sandwich was awfully dry and bland. A couple of my coworkers ordered the tender flank steak and they were surprised with how small and chewy the steak was.

I like that they have seasonal beers, on top of a variety of beers and cocktails, but you can get that at a lot of other places.

It's a nice environment to enjoy a beer and share some appetizers with some friends or coworkers after work. But that's all it really is."}
{"text":"I Enjoy this place?  It's a busy sat night, me and my buddys had a few drinks, order calamari and a poutine. They have a variety of drinks so no need to go downtown now.  If you have 1 too many drinks, DON'T DRIVE!!

There are ride checks around that area??"}
{"text":"Me and my sister decided to stop here when we broke away from a family vacation in Toronto. We walked in and immediately liked the atmosphere the place had. We decided to sit at the bar and were very quickly greeted by a very friendly bartender (who we later found is named Stacey). My sister tried to order the brown, which was unfortunately sold out - which I take to mean it's pretty good - so we decided on the amber. It was delicious and we both finished very quickly. I followed up with a jack and Coke and my sister a vodka tonic. Both were made with a very good balance of liquor and Coke/tonic. The prices are affordable and the service and drinks were fantastic! Would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and enjoyed everything including food and service.  This occasion I came with my family to celebrate my son's birthday thinking we were in for a guaranteed great night.  But it didn't happen. 

 First of all we were seated and told our waitresses name and that she would be right there.   We waited 15 min without anyone stopping at our table before I got up and went to the hostess to find out what was happening as we hadn't seen anyone nor even received menus.   She promptly moved us to another area of the restaurant and told who our new waitress would be.  After waiting a few more minutes we saw our waitress and we ordered our appetizer, food and drinks.  We got our drinks right away but not the appetizers .   Finally after a good 20 minutes the waitress came over and said the appetizer wouldn't be ready for another 10 min but our meals were ready.  In saying that she asked if we still wanted the appetizer to which I replied no.   After serving our meals I asked how that happened and she admitted that she forgot to enter it.   It was just the icing on the cake.   Here I brought the family bragging about the food and the service only to have the worst service I have ever had anywhere.   I believe with the mistakes that obviously the staff were well aware of warranted a visit from the manager on duty to at least apologize but that didn't happen. 

As for the food it was once again very good but I must say the portion sizes have become much smaller since I first started going here when it opened.  We all left feeling unsatisfied as I ended up sharing my meal with my hungry boys.   It's too bad you took a great place with a great menu and destroyed it with bad staff.  

Overall I was less than impressed this visit and I am in no hurry to go back."}
{"text":"I would give it a half star if I could. This is pub food at it's worst. The burgers we ordered were too dry and overcooked and beer wasn't the greatest. Will not return."}
{"text":"I've been to this place on a few occasions. I wish I could give it more stars since to be honest I do frequent it on a regular basis. However, I go for the drinks and not so much the food. The beer is a great deal at $8.99 a litre and is the main attraction. It's cold, it's crisp and it's got a hint of a wheat beer taste which is a welcomed change from the watery domestics. On the topic of drinks - AVOID the cocktails. At $7 for a Bloody Mary, I almost laughed when it arrived because the glass was so small. I learned quickly to stick to the beer. 

As for food, it's just okay. Their menu is meant to be an accompaniment to a drink, but unfortunately the quality is lacking. I've had their flatbreads, open faced sandwiches and some of their apps and haven't been overly pleased with any of them. Family and friends have had some of their meat dishes and I've heard that the meat is fatty and bland, and side dishes are mediocre. 

My recommendation would be to use this as your place for drinks and small snacks before a movie or club. But it is definitely not somewhere I'd go with the intention of a nice meal."}
{"text":"Been here twice, sat in the same booth both times. The servers and food were great, and ill be bring many more friends back. Their in house amber ale is one of the best I've had! The blue cheese burger was also a highlight.

Would recommend!!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and the place is awesome.  Beer is brewed in house so can't buy it anywhere else.  On top of that beer is really good.  Waiters and waitresses are awesome.  This is a place I would tip 20 percent.  Keep it up:)"}
{"text":"I was excited to finally try this place but it was a complete disappointment. The service was lukewarm, just like the fries that came with my chicken and waffles entree. The deep-fried cheesecake sounded enticing on the menu, but was actually an underwhelming cheesecake bite coated with crispy bits. There is definitely better food in the area -- it was a disappointing experience and I will not be returning there."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and my feelings are lukewarm. The staff is nice but they seemed rushed and don't try to make too much of a connection.
I had the lamb, and it was just okay, the veggies that came with it had no flavor, and the mashed potatoes were a little underwhelming.
However their beer cocktails are actually really good, and their chocolate moose lives up to its description of being sinfully good. 
Might try this place during the week when it's not as busy to see if it's any better"}
{"text":"The beer is hit and miss. The service by Sarah was horrible. She obviously hates life."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times, but my most recent visit was an absolute pleasure. I was on my way back from a concert, feeling a bit peckish, but feeling even more thirsty. As usual, the food was great, the beer was great, and the laid back atmosphere was just very... casual. 

BUT- the waitress I had that evening was spectacular! Not only was she helpful, and super attentive- she was absolutely hilarious! Hilarious to the point where my girlfriend and I had tears in our eyes from laughing so hard!

So, thank you Stacey (I hope I spelled that right)... from your two customers in their own little \"oasis\"! You made our awesome night that much better!"}
{"text":"Horrible. It was so hot, manager lied and said the temp was 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Food and drinks took too long. Signed up on Yelp just to post this."}
{"text":"I checked out the Three Brewers, which is also known by the name Les 3 Brasseurs (the chain is based in France, believe it or not), for a pint or two of beer during a weekend in Toronto.  The beer was a little pricey, tasted a bit unfiltered as well.  However, the unfiltered taste may be intentional, since their beer is meant to be non-pasteurized based on an old recipe.  It's an OK place, but I'll likely opt to check out a different place for a pint of beer the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Summary: incompetence or intentional over-billing to pocket money

Group of 8 went during 3rd week of new opening. Food was great but waitress split bill into 9 for us to pay for some reason; she must have miscounted but we paid all the bills anyways. Then she came with 2 additional bills 20 minutes later and said we didn't pay. These were the same bills that were already paid for with cash. We did not understand why we had a total of 11 bills when there were only 8 of us and ended up over-billed. Maybe the waitress forgot to mark those 2 bills as already paid for and couldn't remember so she made us pay them a second time. Waitress was also unwilling to pull the full combined bill to go over what was paid and what wasn't.

Either the waitress was incompetent or intentionally over-billing us for more money. Not sure if we're coming back. Maybe just don't ask to split bills or go to the downtown location instead.

Breakdown
Billing: 0/5
Food & beer: 4.5/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Customer service: 3/5"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this restaurant/pub since my first year of university. And every experience I have had here has been great. They serve a creative selection of their own craft beers and some very good food. 

They serve blonde, amber and dark beers and unique mixes that change seasonally. I recently tried a mix called the latino and it was absolutely delicious. 
This pub is the ultimate place to come with a group of friends and just enjoy drinking beer and eating food. No matter how large my group is they have always been able to accommodate and most times going out of their way to ensure we have seating. Service is great, sometimes slow when its busy but they are very proficient at splitting bills and being gracious about it as well. As for the food the sauerkraut is a must and their pizzas and nachos are great for sharing. In conclusion this is a Toronto bar that is a whole lot of fun with friends on a night out that must be tried."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on a Thursday night. It was my first time at this place and I was eager to see what it was all about side it had been an empty space for so long. 

Right off the bat - super nice atmosphere and very clean! Was greeted immediately.

Our server was absolutely amazing. I wish I remembered his name so that I could post it on here. He was funny and very attentive without being in your face. He offered meal suggestions, and beer suggestions and even brought over multiple samples. 

I had the strawberry beer. It was amazing! We also ordered the chicken wings... Some of the best I've had. And the flamma chips. 

I had the Niçoise salad (wanted something light after the wings) and my friend had the Mac and cheese grilled cheese. Everything was amazing. 

Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I came here multiple times to watch the Jays postseason games on their giant TV. The food was actually better than I expected with reasonable prices. The atmosphere was good and the servers were friendly and attentive. I really liked the cheesecake, it was super creamy. But yes, good selection of food and drinks."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant in Montreal, Ottawa & Toronto - they really need to work on their food - I know we just ordered an app platter but it was disgusting - same experience at every location - thankfully the beer is decent - I think I am done trying to make this place into something it isn't"}
{"text":"Decent food...bad, bad service. I came here after reading good reviews. The drinks and food were pretty good and a nice change from other pubs. But I will not be returning because of the horrible service from my particular waitress. She seemed nice at first and very attractive, but I had to ask 3 times for our drinks, napkins, forks etc. She got my order wrong (I ordered the fish and chips and got braised lamb instead) and when I tried to tell her, she insisted that I was mistaken and not her. So I had to pay for a dish that I never ordered PLUS make another order for what I originally wanted. Upon receiving the bill, I paid with credit card and left a 12% tip, which was decent considering our annoyance throughout the night. When she read the receipt, she later returned to our table and told us that the \"typical\" tip was at least 15%, and we can pay the rest of her tip with cash. She walked away before we could say anything.  We were only a table of 3 and her attitude throughout the night was extremely disrespectful. Horrible experience. Never again."}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times. Good atmosphere, friendly staff, and good food. Their burger is amazing and the steak is ok as well.

However, I definitely wouldn't order their Caesar salad or Belgian waffle dessert. The Caesar salad was bland and tasteless and the waffle dessert was really dry (the ice cream didn't help) and way too sweet."}
{"text":"Was really excited for for 3 Brewers to open up in Richmond Hill as I really enjoyed the downtown location. Came here with a couple of friends for dinner. We had a reservation and was immediately seated. As we were waiting for the other was decided to get the Oktoberfest special which include a small platter and a litre The Munich which was their feature beer ($17). My friend and I decided to split the litre since it was lot for us to have individually, so we asked the server for an extra glass. We were a bit shocked when the server told us that it will spill everywhere and she wouldn't recommend it. Really? Perhaps help us? We said we still wanted an extra glass and the attitude immediately shown on her face... Of  course we were able to split 2 glasses without making a mess. We really didn't understand why that was made more complicated than it needed to be. 

The food itself was great and larger pub sized portions. I had the fish and chips and my friends had different kinds of burger. All around $15 which is pretty standard pricing. I hope that was just a one off experience as I really enjoyed the beer and the food."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worse bar/pub that I've ever visited in Toronto!  Horrible, in-acceptable service!!!!

 My 3 guests are I were trying to get a drink after our corporate work party this past Friday night.  We found an available seat by the bar and waited patiently for 15 minutes for a server. The young server (who btw didn't look older than 21), did not greet us, and immediately told us to leave the establishment because according to him, we were too intoxicated to be served alcohol.   Neither of us were drunk, in fact one of us doesn't even drink. I immediately asked for the manager, and he, also told us to leave without any explanation. 

We're all mature, established, professionals (all within our late 30s and 40s) and we were just appalled over their false accusations and incredibly rude 'service'.   

 I will be sure to spread the word and officially write a complaint letter to the BBB and ensure that this in-excusable behavior does not repeat itself!"}
{"text":"Needed dinner on a Saturday night and didn't want anything crazy expensive.  We LOVED this place.  The beer was good and the food was great.  When we walked in it was packed yet we were seated right away. I would definitely come here again and try a pizza bread."}
{"text":"I often walk pass this restaurant and it is always packed. 

A couple of co-workers decided to stop by after work. We have heard great things about the 3 Brewers, one being that they brew their own beer. 

Two rounds of beer pitcher, Brown Ale and Amber Ale. Great beer! - This did prompt us to use the facility more often than we would like. One note on the washroom at the 3 Brewers... you have to go through many flight of stairs, up and down, in order to get to their washroom. It's not a maze, but it certainly is a little more 'work' than I am used to - maybe I am just lazy!

As for the dinner selection, I couldn't decide between the \"Moulin Rouge\" and the Braised Lamb Shank. The server says that both are super popular; I ended  up with the Moulin Rouge. Great choice I have to say. There are a lot of fillings on the flat bread - I love the spicy steak and the mushroom. As matter of fact, there were so much fillings that the flat bread had a hard time keeping them all on there! I love it when a restaurant is being generous!

I will definitely come back again to try their Braised Lamb Shank.

If you haven't tried this restaurant, I highly recommend you to."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and I will definetly be back. We ordered a regular poutine and upgraded to their maxi fries (thick cut), Milan flatbread (spicy sausages, red peppers, hot peppers, cheese, and basil), and their Italian burger with arugula, tomato, and goat cheese. The burger was to die for since I love goat cheese. The flat bread was a little cold so we sent it back. The waiter was really friendly about it and it was actually taken off our bill!"}
{"text":"Okay, lets get the important stuff out of the way.

The beer was lack-luster.

Alright, now that that has been taken care of... the food was very average and unexceptional, to the point that I cannot recall, at this very moment, what it was that I had for dinner (it was a sandwich, I think). My friend and I planned on having a quick bite because we wanted to get out of there so we could do some shopping at Eaton's Centre before everything closed; however, the wait staff had other plans in mind. Getting and paying the bill was a twenty-minute affair. We were fully ignored and it was a dismal experience.

Will not return."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Cam in sat down and was not seen by a server even though is was near the bar. 20 min later she brought a flat beer and said it was brewed in the back. Terrible service. Worse product."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to this franchise before, pretty nice place. Enjoyed the flamm with an amber beer."}
{"text":"I decided to have lunch at Les 3 Brasseurs a total of three times, one for each brasseur, before I passed judgment.  It is a very attractive  space with a nice patio, tasty beer and very friendly staff.  Almost all of the ingredients for an enjoyable meal.  The only missing element is consistently good food.  All three meals were average to meh with a hint of the quality you expect at the roadhouse concept chains.  Fast service but limited attention to quality.  On the most recent excursion, my guest and I each had an order of mussels and frites. Unfortunately the mussels tasted old, the broth was a little too heavily seasoned and each order had 5-6 mussels with prominently cracked shells (Note to the kid in the kitchen....you need to discard those ones).  I personally expect more for the price of a main. I was torn between a two star and a three star rating.  The food is a solid two but the amber and the overall experience is a solid three.

The atmosphere, beer and friendly staff will definitely bring me back.  I will just limit my order to the beer and the appetizers."}
{"text":"I like the beer, I like the food, I like the location.  While I rarely to never talk about service: service here is slow.  That combined with a no reservation policy, this place is always packed.  Great spot to grab beers downtown though, especially if you're catching a movie right after...."}
{"text":"The pricing is very fair . And there is so much you want to try that you have to go back another time .... the service was good at this location, and so was the food . I had the chicken and waffles! Delicious buttermilk fried chicken sandwiched between two sweet Belgian waffles with a little bit of mayo, lettuce and tomato. Simple but delicious.  My boyfriend ordered the same thing and we were both very happy. I have been to the heartland location as well, the service was slower but still good food especially for the price..... going back to try the soft pretzels...."}
{"text":"Although, I have not eaten there todate I found the place a welcome addition to the Dundas Square area. Having a micro-brewery right on the premises, one has to try the sampler offering. I have settled down to the dark brew which is very much like a dark Belgium Leffe, but slightly lighter and a lot cheaper.
Knowledgeable young bartender. Having glanced over the menu, yes it does look very traditional pub food, but there seemed to me to be some different alternatives. Will check back-in once I have eaten there"}
{"text":"Definitely a sports bar vibe. The menu is small and the one food item we ordered, the crispy calamari, was so tough that we decided that dinner was out the question.  Our server was lovely and the beer was good too!  Next time, just drinks, for sure."}
{"text":"Interesting selection of beer to choose from but food was mediocre tasting, small portions and pretty expensive.  Decent atmosphere, just didn't really hook me.  Staff needs to be more attentive."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars easily for the beer. They brew it all on premises and it is always really fresh tasting. If you can't decide on a brew you can order a sampler of cute little miniature pints. The food is not bad but nothing to rave about although I gotta say the portions are quite generous for the price. We had the charcuterie plate to start which I wouldn't order again. The bread was lovely and fresh and warm but It was mostly salad and the goat cheese listed is only a very small bit. The pickles were clearly not made in house. For mains I had the schnitzel which I found to be slightly over cooked. It comes with sausage, sauerkraut and mashes potatoes. The sauerkraut, like the pickles, was obviously out of a jar, and not a very fancy one. The vegetables were diced up and I think they might have been frozen. I didn't eat them. The potatoes and sausage though were great. My boyfriend had the beer braised pork shanks. These were fatty as is to be expected with pork shanks but they were really well cooked and a generous portion. I would definitely go back as the location is convenient and the beer is awesome but if you're really particular about food there are plenty of better places."}
{"text":"Review based on the Yonge St (near Eaton Centre) location for dinner.  I will not be returning here.

Food, I ordered the fish & chips and it was over fried, was not too happy with that, the fries was okay, coleslaw was passable.  It wasn't a bad deal at $11, but I have had better.

Atmosphere, it has a European bar/pub decor (dark wood, some simple stain glass), you can see the vat downstairs (I didn't go upstairs so I'm not sure what is there).  It is rather noisy here, so if you expect to catch up with your friends or on a date, note that you will be yelling a bit to be heard.

Service, our waitress was okay, nothing to complain about but nothing amazing either.  Oddly, the waitress is not the one to bring you your food but there is a server that does this specific role, which means, they don't know who ordered what (bigger issue if you have a big group, not so much when you only have two people).  Food was pretty quick to come after you ordered.

Drinks, I didn't order anything, but they do have a wide range of beers available and at many different sizes (starting at 8oz to 36oz).

Cost, prices aren't bad for a bar/pub especially given the location."}
{"text":"Tasteful interior, clean. We sat in a booth. Our waitress was courteous and checked on us frequently. I liked the presentation and layout of their menu which they designed to look like a newspaper.

I had the cassoulet which I never had before but it sounded filling and had a wide variety of proteins including white beans, pork, duck confit and sausage. The proteins were nicely balanced in flavour by the vegetable which consisted of a mirepoix (onions, celery, carrot), tomatoes and garlic with brown beer as a base. For my liking the crust on the cassoulet could have been executed better since the breadcrumbs absorbed all the moisture from the dish and was soggy, but taste wise it was delicious and served piping hot. I especially appreciated that there were chunks of meat rather than finely shredded meat. Also, the accompanying salad was light, had a good mixture of greens, cherry tomatoes and red peppers, red onion and was seasoned nicely with a subtlety sweet and refreshing Dijon vinaigrette. 

Good food.

Some of my friends ordered HUGE beers. I will be returning to try those at a later date :)"}
{"text":"I called to ask if there was online ordering so my friends and I could place an order, and \"Jim\" refused to talk to me, treating me like a salesperson or something... Never getting food from there ever again with that kind of disrespect."}
{"text":"Not great, but not bad. This was my third occasion to visit the three brewers, and once again I had a very consistent experience- just ok. On the plus side they have a very affordable kids menu ($7 with choice of main, side, drink and dessert) on the negative the service is very slow. If you are looking for a quick meal, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Arrived around 8:00 with a party of 7 an they seated us right away.  Was pretty impressed.  Ordered beer and sweet potato fries because I wasn't really hungry.  Was good.... Can't complain.   Our party ordered steak, ribs. Open faced sandwich, burger, and pizza like dish.  Everyone was happy with their food.  Would go back."}
{"text":"I called ahead to see if they could accommodate me. They said yes. 
We went there on Sunday after a show. It was busy, but we had a reservation so we got seated right away. Our waitress came and we placed our orders
My turn came and I said I was vegan and asked the waitress what she would recommend. Salad was the only thing she said. I told her I had called ahead and was told they could make something vegan from the menu like pizza. Finally the waitress said ok, but the pizza won't taste good without the cheese! Seriously in need of some retraining! 
I told her, again, that I was vegan and that the pizza would taste awesome without the cheese. 
When our food came my pizza looked funny. I had my sister taste it and she couldn't say for sure that there wasn't something like cream on it. It had a slight creamy, milky look.
I asked the waitress who assured me that she spoke to the chef who said it was vegan and she was sure that it was. 
I wasn't happy with that response so asked to speak with the manager. 
He came and when I asked again about the pizza, he said it is a sour cream based sauce!
I'm so happy that I went with my gut and didn't trust the waitress. The manager said he would give me a salad for free. Thanks so much for the $6 salad (heavy sarcasm). 
I expected so much more from this restaurant. We live in a world class city, and the only thing I could get in a large downtown restaurant was a salad. Absolutely horrible. 
The staff needs to be trained on food restrictions (what if I had a food allergy) and our waitress needs to not LIE to customers."}
{"text":"On Saturday January 23, 2016 we had the pleasure of dining at \"The 3 Brewers\" in Richmond Hill, Ontario. \"The 3 Brewers\" is a microbrewery with its origins from France and who craft their beer on site. We rate the atmosphere a 4 out of 5 stars. The decor has a casual, hip, downtown European feel with its stylish exposed brick walls, industrial cement floors and raw wooden table tops. The glass enclosed beer vats makes for an interesting and nostalgic focal point of the restaurant. The lighting was perfect setting a relaxing mood and making it easy to read the menu. The tables and seating were comfy and well spread apart making it easy to converse amongst our party. However, we felt the temperature in the restaurant was a bit too warm and although there is a big screen tv and a couple of smaller monitors  about the restaurant. We felt much need for even more monitors for better and more comfortable viewing. We rate the cleanliness of the restaurant a 4 out of 5 stars. The tables, seats, utensils etc seemed very clean. We noticed they hand washed the beer glasses at the bar with a careful 3 step washing process. The washrooms were kept pretty clean. However, I didn't have t.p. In my stall and my neighbour said she was running low. Thank goodness she had \"a square to spare!\" We rate the service a 3 out of 5 stars. Upon arrival the hostess gave us a friendly and warm welcome and quickly showed us to our table. The wait staff came over relatively quick and seemed quite knowledgeable. However, we felt she didn't check back with us enough times as we had to flag her down a few times for her help. On the other hand the manager was awesome, he seemed to make his way around the restaurant checking in with the guests, made good recommendations, running food to the tables and was very hospitable. All the food orders came out all together and relatively quick for a busy Sat. night. We rate the food a 3 out of 5 stars. The menu is pub style food with many items that pay hommage to their traditional French roots. We loved the concept of beer sampler tray. It was a fun experience to discover all the different tastes of their beers. The food was pretty tasty and quite enjoyable with a nice presentation. Overall, we the mysterious 4 recommend \"The 3 Brewers\" in Richmond Hill, Ontario with a 3.5 out of 5 stars. Heads up, The Mysterious  4 may be coming to a restaurant near you."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and some family on a Friday night. We were visiting from the states & they wanted to bring us to eat dinner somewhere that was open late. The place looked busy, but we were able to be seated right away for a table of 9.

Our server was nice, but only came by every so often. We ordered the metre of beer which is ten 9 oz. glasses of their beer ranging from white to brown. I'm not much of a beer drinker, but it was pretty good. I had the blonde, which tasted like blue moon and the brown which had a slight coffee taste.

We ordered appetizers that were just meh. We had the nachos, calamari, and the poutine. The nachos were pretty cold and the chicken added was so dry. The fries for the poutine were an old batch, so they were old and mushy but the gravy on top kept them warm. I'm assuming it was old because it was towards the end of the night, like around 11pm/12am. The only thing I liked was the calamari.

Overall our experience was okay. I can see why people would come here, its a nice place to hangout with friends but I don't think I'll be going back next time I come to Mississauga."}
{"text":"We stopped by here around 9:30 and found the seats at the upstairs bar with no wait! Two beers, an order of nachos and the waffle dessert were our picks - and we had the best time. It's loud and lively. Ice hockey was playing on tv and we just enjoyed the night. Warning - the waffles and caramel sauce are so sweet!"}
{"text":"We tried the one on Winston Churchill and liked it so we tried the one on Mavis which is closer to the house.  Unfortunately, not the same experience.  My wife had the chicken burger.  Not much chicken plus it was overcooked so kind of dry.  My daughter had the classic burger.  Also overcooked and dry even. She said the bun and fries were good.  I had the stew.  I thought the portion was kind of small.  The blonde was tasty."}
{"text":"We went on st. patrick's day and the atmospher was so nice ! Of course, we enjoyed it .
The employees were very friendly and kind. I favorite this plcae and wanna go again for sure."}
{"text":"Great tourist ripoff joint.  Means dont bother. Had the burger and fries. Service was very slow. I love all sorts of fries. These were cold and not edible.  There are so many better options around Yonge st.  Find an alternative."}
{"text":"Come here for the ultimate tourist experience. Fun and gimmicky .. Food is OK and the beer is nothing to get excited about. Great for really big groups . Staff and friendly and accommodating ."}
{"text":"I love the kind of hot wings they do here. Tried the IPA and it went well with the wings.  This place was surprisingly huge, and if you're sitting downstairs and make a trip to the washroom you'll get a full tour of the place! Wait staff was quick and friendly. Had a good experience here."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off with my biggest complaint about 3 Brewers.  That being said, please don't let this complaint sway you from going, because I really think it's the best place in Richmond Hill.  Read on.

I've been to a lot of Craft Breweries recently.  The staff is always quite knowledgeable about the beer they serve.  The Indie Ale House is a great example and so is The Bier Markt.  The staff can tell you anything about any beer on the menu and that's pretty impressive  because the The Bier Markt has over 150 beers!

3 Brewers has only hired bimbos.

You had me at \"Craft Beer\"!  I don't need a set of tits to lure me into the place.  The staff could consist ladies that look like Martina Navratilova in pulled up cargo shorts and I'd still happily return.

I understand what 3 Brewers is doing.  The area has a Moxie's and a Jack Astor's who's staff consists of very attractive girls to please the men that come in from the sea of industry surrounding the area.  The problem there is, the food and beer at Moxie's and Jack Astor's is shit, so they have to overcompensate and find other reasons for people (men) to come in.  Pussy.

3 Brewers doesn't need to overcompensate.  They're now the big swinging dick in the area and they shouldn't try so hard to compete.  It makes them look bad.  They have the best beer in Richmond Hill, all brewed on site, and the food was unbelievably good.

I had the IPA to start, and ordered the Sausage & Sauerkraut for lunch.  They had a graphic on the menu next to what I ordered showing which beer paired well with it. Since I'm old as fuck now, (39) I couldn't read it without my glasses.  When I asked my server what went best with the Sausage & Sauerkraut, she replied with a \"Whatever beer you like!\"  The answer was the Amber, which I saw online afterwards. (and is also the name of half the staff there.)

\"Hey you pretentious douche!  Give those unemployable bimbos a break!  They had to get up at the crack of noon to halfheartedly serve you!\"  I understand that I'm asking a lot of poorly paid, young, attractive girls, but 3 Brewers is good, when it could be great!

{"text":"Great place! Food was excellent. I ordered steak and a blonde beer and love their app choices. Awesome staff. Wish more people know about this place. Highly recommend this"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and love it.  Busy on Saturdays so be prepared.  Food is good but their excellence is in the beer!"}
{"text":"Went last night and was pleasantly surprised by the interior decor, liveliness, service and food. 
Really nice to see a downtown Toronto type brewery in the heart of Mississauga. I had the BBQ chicken breast and it was delicious! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 brewers sauerkraut, grill salmon and double deluxe burger. The ham is too salty!  Grill salmon is a little bit dry. The bread is good and meat is juicy. The Belle Province beer is very good."}
{"text":"WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBOURHOOD!

I haven't stepped inside a 3 Brewers since I took a trip to Montreal some years ago. The one thing I remember was a \"Shirley Temple-like\" beer cocktail that didn't agree with me. But! It's a new day, and a new location that's opened up right in my neighbourhood! 

I dropped in with the the little bro on an early weeknight and it wasn't too busy inside, but I think that's more because folks are still finding out about this place opening up. First thing I noticed walking in was whole area that was set up to make beer. Yes, they make all their beer in house! (I found out later that if you drop by early during lunch, sometimes you can catch the brewers at work!) In fact, most of the food items on their menu come with a beer pairing suggestion to go along with it. My brother went with the blonde beer and I asked for the IPA. Before pouring me a full pint, the server offered me a sample of the beer to get a taste of it. (Of course, I gladly accepted!) It was quite good! Not too hoppy, right in the \"sweet spot\"!

As the menu suggested, I paired my IPA with a pulled pork poutine which was perfect. We were still abit hungry after we finished our mains, so we decided to split an order of nachos as well. While we didn't really notice (Must have been because we still had a couple beers to finish off), our server apologized for the delay in getting the nachos out and offered to comp a dessert for us. BONUS POINTS! We decided on a cookie-like dessert called the Blondie. it was alright, but then again, I don't have the biggest sweet tooth to judge either. 

We left quite stuffed, but with definitely a good impression of this place. Good food and great service! Look forward to when the warmer weather rolls in and the patio opens up. I can see myself being a regular here, for sure!"}
{"text":"Pretty surprising place!  The renovations since Baton Rouge look really great.  It's an open concept place with a sunken floor in front of a huge tv.  It would be an awesome place to view some games with a group of people.  

The menu is slightly French and slightly Belgian and slightly American.  Think duck confit, sausages and hamburgers.  

I wanted something differenI so I ordered the pork shank and my husband ordered the steak frites.  To start we shared the tuna tartare and to finish the chocolate mousse.  

The food was alright, the best being the frites.  Thinly sliced and crispy with just enough salt.  My pork shank wasn't what I expected....there was a spice flavour to it that wasn't quite to my liking.  However it was very tender and a huge portion.  It was a nice change to your standard lamb shank.   The mousse was very rich and very chocolatey but the most surprising thing about it was its size.   It was so small!  Granted it was $5.00 but still....just a few scoops and it was gone!  

I am looking forward to going back.  Maybe during game night for some extra buzz!"}
{"text":"I read some of the reviews - maybe my palette isn't as refined but I was very happy with the special brew today (tues. April 5) maybe it was the unexpected fact that I had an hour to kill sans enfant and so aftershave might have tasted wonderful but I don't think so. 

Also got a forgettable appetizer but would gladly return for another pint."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food!  First time here and happy to have a local micro brewery. We even got a tour of brewery with Justin the Master Brewer! The Postal Farmhouse Ale and Munich is a must try!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Their beers are probably the best I've had. Blonde beer is to die for. Prices are reasonable too. The place itself is chill and great. Someone told me about their loyalty card I'm gonna get that too. It's my go to place almost every weekend."}
{"text":"This place is kinda cool with making their own variety of beers.  Servers are really friendly.  The only thing i was not impressed about was their beer glasses were not that clean, my had someone's lip stick on it, but the server did change the glass and refilled my beer.  Food was not too bad but everything did tasted a bit too salty.

I went there twice.  Still an okay place to go back sometimes to hang out with friends :-)"}
{"text":"I've been to a few of these in Montreal and enjoyed the home brews on tap.

This one had a very different feel to it.  It may be based on the location (downtown Toronto) but I left here disappointed with the food and service.  Our sever was very blunt - minimal small talk even though it wasn't very busy - and the burger that I ordered was not visually pleasing.  It looked like something that Wendy's would serve...no grill marks on the pattie!

Beer was solid though."}
{"text":"Great deal for $18.99 (one pitcher of any choice and four fried appetizers). Really great for get together and hangouts! Highly recommend their calamari, pulled pork poutine**, and of course the White Wine steamed mussels!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday night and there wasn't a wait at  all. The place is ginormous. Three levels of eating and there's two bars. Ones upstairs and one downstairs. Had lots of people working so it was hard to tell who are waiter was. Good was good. Don't get the normal fries bc they are very boring compared to there sweet potato fries for a couple bucks extra. But overall very good. Loves the vibe of the place. And employees were nice. Would go again yo try something else"}
{"text":"Delicious and reasonably priced beers. Food is a nice compliment to their beers and the free peanuts are a nice touch. Great ambience as well. I would gladly return!"}
{"text":"I had a good time at Les 3 Brasseurs for a friend's good bye party.

They are a microbrewery, so they sell their own beer made in-house. They have a tasting option, where you get small glasses of each beer, which I found to be very useful. Spirits were pretty cheap priced too, if my memory serves correctly. 

As for food options, it's your usual pub fare. Vegetarian wise, you are only limited to a few choices. I had the tomato and goat cheese flamm while my other vegan friend had the vegetarian flamm. While I definitely enjoyed mine, after a while it did seem to be a bit dull and I started to eye my friend's flamm.

The server was very friendly and helpful, even if we had a HUGE number of people."}
{"text":"I'd like to start off by saying that I'm a regular in this plaza, and have had fantastic experiences at the other restaurants surrounding. I had visited this restaurant a few months ago just to try it out, since its a micro brewery (I love beer). The beer was fantastic, I think the one i liked was called Postal farmhouse. Anyways, we all decided to order some appetizers to start and of course more beer, but we wanted to try different beers. She came back and brought a few of us the wrong beer (didn't see her write anything down, so she probably forgot). Not a big deal since people make mistakes, but she THEN began to argue with us saying we were wrong and did order what she had brought. I have never in my life had a server argue with me or anyone with me about what kind of drink they ordered. Mind you, before all of this we asked for a few samples since we had never been here before, but she told us (a group of 5) that we could have 1 each for now. Just to put it out there, I believe her name was Macey. So she brought over the new drinks and became very rude the rest of the night, stopped coming around us to see how everything else was or if we needed anything. We were extremely upset, and asked her if we could speak to a manager right before asking for the bill but no one came over to us, so we assumed they did not care and we left. 

A few weeks ago I decided to try this place out again, and had a better experience the second time around. It was quite busy that night, but our server nelou was fantastic and a complete sweetheart. Gave us samples of the different feature beer (which the prior server never explained to us). Overall I would visit again, but probably only for drinks. 

Food - Food was okay
Beers - Great and very inexpensive. 
Service - HIT OR MISS (very unfortunate)."}
{"text":"Went to this place twice in the last month. Figured the first time was just a bad experience, but the second experience was just as bad.

Went on a Monday night and arrived at 12:50 AM. They seated us and told us to order quickly as last call was coming up. (Last call??? Bar closes at 2AM!) And they should not be so pushy. 

There were six of us so we were debating in getting 2, 3, or 4 pitchers. (Yes, we're beasts!)

We settled on two and told the waitress we would order 2 more on the next round. She said \"ok.\"

So we get the beer, which I enjoy so that was fine. No peanuts. Two in our party had to go to the bar to get them. The place was warm and dim which I like but there were peanut shells everywhere and little effort to clean it up.

So we finish one pitcher and are down to just a little left on the final pitcher when the waitress comes back around 1:35 and asks anything for last call. We told her we'd get the other two pitchers we had talked about earlier. She goes on a long-winded speech about how she can't justify giving us two pitchers with two already on the table (they were practically empty) and she said she can give us a pint each if we want.  Does that make sense? 

So we can't get two pitchers which would give us about a pint and a half each, but we can still order just a pint each? This is just stupid. We could have said yes, but my night at this place was done for.

We were not drunk, disturbing the peace, or drinking recklessly. If she would have done her job and come around more often, at say 1:20 instead of leaving us alone for almost 35 minutes and rejected us THEN, we could have gone somewhere else with time to spare until last call.

So we ask for nothing else, get the bill and then head over to Jack Astor's up the street at the AMC for drinks on their amazing patio which looks over Dundas Square. We were given 3 pitchers at 1:55 AM, and then allowed to hang out until past 2:30AM. We told our waiter about our experience and he was shocked. I guess she was just shutting us down so that she could wrap up, bring the bill, and have us leave. 

Good beer. Not bad service, but stupid service."}
{"text":"Located conveniently  across from the Eaton Centre and close to Yonge and Dundas, The 3 Brewers is great for their beer selection and fact they brew onsite was nice.  Local microbreweries has become more popular over the past few years.

Our party of three sat in the bar area on the main floor which was quite noisy as music was loud, so we felt like we were shouting at each other the whole night.  Not a great place for catching up, but we made the best of it and enjoyed our beers.

Another negative thing, to get to the washrooms is like a maze.  Had to take stairs to the second floor, then walk across landing passed the bar, and then go down half a flight to the washrooms.  I feel bad for people with mobility problems because it's definitely not accessible friendly.

Since we had dinner a couple of hours earlier we weren't hungry,  but ended up sharing a poutine near the end of the night.  Poutine wasn't too salty, fries were crispy and the amount of gravy was a good portion to the fries.

Service was friendly and attentive.  Bonus about sitting close to the bar our glass was never empty as server was always in sight.

Overall, it was a fairly good experience, but I think the company helped as well.  

Visited early February"}
{"text":"Everything you want in a lively lunch spot and after work bar. The staff clearly understand the typical lunchtime crowd and brought our food and drinks out in record time. I had the warm bean and salmon salad, my colleagues had the Moroccan chicken salad, and the grilled mac and cheese. My salmon was slightly fishy but otherwise the dish was good. All servers were young, professional and experienced. Bathrooms were clean. $11 beer stein was the equivalent of 2 pints. Good value. I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a post-work social with a group of 8 people. The server was extremely nice and accommodating to all our asks. I got the 3 Brewers Burger and was pleasantly surprised with the flavour. In my experience, burgers tend to run on the salty side but this burger was sweet. I think it is because the bacon is drizzled or fried in syrup. However, the sweetness of the burger definitely made it a memorable eat. We also participated in a brewery tour - Rob was friendly and knew his stuff."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe the poor reviews, so as I live close by I had to come and try this place for myself.

Nice welcome, seated quickly although quite busy (Friday Lunchtime). Waitress personable and told us a lot of things about the menu and the pub concept. 

I'm a Guinness fan (understatement) and tried their stout... very, very good!!

Ordered Mediterranean chicken salad and my wife had the Philly Poutine, both very good (although my chicken was a little dry).

Would recommend to any of my family and friends."}
{"text":"The 3 Brewers is a very happening eatery. We started with the beer and cheddar soup which shared. There was nothing left over- very tasty. My wife ordered the Flammenkuchen I had a half rack of ribs. Ribs fell off the bone and the Flammenkuchen was light and very tasty.   We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great beer, brewed in house!  If you like to try different beers then this is the place, none of your typical beer store/lcbo brand beers.

Why the 3-star?  We came here for the pork shank and I think that dish used to be very popular and very good.  However, they now replaced it with lamb shank which was absolutely average.  Basically mashed potatoe and lamb shank submerged in mixed veggie stew, very disappointed afterwards and had to order other food items to compensate myself.  Wish they bring the 'pork shank' back instead.

This place is very big with huge and long bar table in the center of the restaurant along with a big multi-pane tv screen in the centre for sports games. I think the bar table easily sits more than 60 people all around it.

I've tried their other dishes before in another location, they were actually not too bad, just that this new lamb shank sort of ruined my dinner at this location, maybe a little harsh on my side.

A more accurate rating would be 4 star for my previous visits at their other locations and 3 star for this visit. 

It's conveniently located in a plaza with 20 some other restaurants and lots of parking spots, but there aren't many empty spots free though so be prepared to wait/look for one.

I still recommend you giving this place a try!  If you and your buddies are looking for a place to have a few drinks and some food at 10PM in Markham/Richmond Hill, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a friends birthday. The atmosphere, food and service was amazing. This is definitely a place to hang out if you love beer, they have a wide selection of beer and three different rooms to store the beer."}
{"text":"I had both the Blonde and the red brewed in the pub. Both were Belgian in style to my tastes which isn't my favorite. We had chicken wings which were ok, and I had a quesadilla which was bland and tasteless. I wouldn't be rushing to go back. Ambiance was good service was ok."}
{"text":"Come here often.  The amber beer is really good and goes with just about everything.  The beef dip sandwich is awesome and the chicken and waffles are out of this world.  Other great items are the Chili Peppy Flam (pizza), burgers and lamb.

I come here 1-2 times a week; the patio is great around lunch time because it's covered and has TV's too!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and kind of duh.
Calamari was greasy as hell and mostly soggy. The sweet chilli dipping sauce was childlike.
The coleslaw was disspaointing. Fish in my fish and chips was small but perfectly cooked. 
Beer was almost cold enough."}
{"text":"Overhyped and overpriced. It's a wannabe gourmet brasserie... But at the end of the day it's just another chain restauant.. 

The lighting was good though and atmosphere was ok."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I went out last night for a drink and catch up and our experience was ok... I had been here twice before which mediocre experiences as well. 

Since we had tried their beer before, we decided to try the sangria which was overly sweet and oddly tangy. You definitely did not taste the wine that was supposed to be in it. So we weren't really a fan of that.

One friend had the French onion soup and she said that she enjoyed it but would probably try something else next time, since she was not overly blown away by it.

My other friend and I decided to split the popcorn shrimp which was a bit of a disappointment. We were happy with the portion but we found a piece of plastic in the breaded coating which no one would enjoy finding. When we told our server, she did take it off of the bill and did offer us dessert (which we declined) which was nice. 

The staff was very nice and because the staff were very attentive and the beer is good, I gave this place 3stars."}
{"text":"Terrific place... Got a tour of the manufacturing process .. What a cool place.. Super beer... ALL made within ..Try the Flamm... Excellent"}
{"text":"Service was good. The Flammkuchen had a nice thin crisp crust and good toppings ( arugula, sun dried  tomatoes and goat cheese). The blonde beer was mediocre not comparable to a European beer. The pub was very noisy"}
{"text":"Good place to come check out! The beer is pretty good, the food is average pub food. We had nachos and onion rings, nothing special about them, although the sriracha ketchup that comes with the onion rings is really good! But the Dijon mayo that comes with them as well tastes like tartar sauce. We were here on a Saturday afternoon and the service was alright, it wasn't very busy and the atmosphere was enjoyable. We tried the 4 small tasters of beer which were good. The IPA was awful in my opinion but it did have a score or 60 for bitterness! We also had the white beer which was good. It's definitely a tourist spot but worth checking out if you want a beer and a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Middle of the road food. The patio chairs are mild torture devices. The server's are very friendly. Drink a lot of beer and you won't notice the first two points."}
{"text":"Oakville recently got a new restaurant called The 3 Brewers  in the Winston Park plaza. It's a great location because the theater is there so it's perfect for date night! 

 There doesn't seem to be a lot of seating inside the restaurant because all the tables are very spaced out.  A good thing about this is that you won't have to worry about invading anyone's personal space! They also have a bar area with a flat screen so it'll definitely accommodate anyone who wants to have a drink and watch a game with their friends.

I was craving a poutine that day so I ordered the smoked meat poutine! There was just enough gravy and cheese curds to mix with the fries! The only issue that I found with this dish was the fact that the seasoning from the gravy in addition to the cheese curds and smoked meat made the dish a bit too salty for my liking.

The classic 3B Burger with cheddar cheese, bacon, tomato, lettuce and onion. It was a clean presentation of the food. The burger was very juicy and easy to eat!

They don't serve pizza here but if you are craving something along those lines, go ahead and try a flammekeuche! It's a flat bread that was developed in the Alsatian region of France. Just looking at it is making me hungry!

 My friend ordered the Campagnarde open faced sandwhich. It's perfect for people who think a full sandwich is too bread and carbs, why not cut the amount of bread in half and still enjoy the same meal!

 If you're looking for comfort food, you can order the fish and chips! You can even substitute you fries for a poutine :) It's the best of both worlds! The fish was over fried a bit so it looks a bit dark.

Texan burger is perfect for those who want to add a little kick to their meal with mild jalapeno cheddar cheese, mushrooms, crispy onions and barbeque sauce!

Overall, the restaurant was good - the portions were perfect, which is hard to find because restaurants usually give more than you can eat and food ends up getting wasted or extra unwanted calories are consumed. The 3 Brewers meals will definitely keep you full without going overboard! The server was very attentive and when he noticed our drinks were getting low he brought us refills without asking!

 The only thing that could have been better was their seating. The patio space is not very big so it'll definitely be hard getting a seat outside on weekends or when the weather is even nicer out!

Another issue that restaurant patrons will quickly realize is the overall cluttered nature of the menu. Despite their various headings and descriptions, the overall abundance of words makes selecting your meal rather difficult."}
{"text":"Have been to locations in Toronto & Montreal but was really disappointed at this one.  Serving sizes are very small and taste is meh.  Beer is good as is service but food is very disappointing.
Will not repeat."}
{"text":"I was SO excited to try this place out but it really fell short. Three Brewers is packed and enormous but leaves me wondering how? 

First of all, my drink. Maybe it's my bad for not going for straight up beer but I got a \"Monaco\" beer cocktail. The thing has their blonde beer, grenadine, and Sprite. Love it! A pint came out in a huge mug with a lime wedge. It all sounds great in theory but in actuality, it tasted kind of metallic and was not pleasant to finish. 

One thing I really did like was the menus. They look like newspapers! I digress. 

Off this good looking menu, I ordered a roasted lamb sandwich. It's another thing that sounds like it will be incredible but didn't pan out. Looking back at the menu, there was supposed to be caramelized onions, slow roasted lamb, chopped tomatoes, and Swiss cheese on a fresh baguette. The onions and Swiss cheese totally did not show up to the party! So basically what was there was just a mound of over-sauced lamb and pale tomato cubes. The meat itself wasn't even great, shaved very thinly but all attached. I got a Cesar salad on the side which is a little extra and it was typical. 
 
In short, the items I ordered did not live up to the grandness off the space and all of the hype one can hear. Service was fine and all the pieces seem to be there. They just have to pull themselves together on the plate."}
{"text":"This place is always really lively on the weekends which is great if you like that kind of atmosphere :) It has so many beer and draft options which is awesome! But I'm not a beer person. Finding a non-beer drink was hard since even the cocktails and martinis were mixed with beer, which is noticeable in the taste. I tried two drinks without beer in them and sadly did not like them one bit. The lemon drop martini sounded delicious but I couldn't taste anything other than the vodka. Hostess was sassy but the waitress and atmosphere were great. 
Overall, good place to go. Just don't expect any great drinks that don't have beer in it."}
{"text":"This is my opinion the best pub  / Restaurant  great bar food and they even make there own beer .
Very cool to watch when they are brewing. 
The staff is always great and happy to serve you .
They are not in a rush to get rid of you they make you feel welcomed stay awhile and watch the game on the big screen. 
I always have a burger when I come yep they are so good."}
{"text":"When it first opened, there seem to have been \"issues\". I didn't expect much but wanted to see if their beer was the same as their Montreal sites. 

However, the service was fast, friendly and the food was tasty and at the right price for a pub-bar type restaurant. I will tell others it is worth a visit, and as it is near work will probably do the beer thing again."}
{"text":"Good spot for last minute dinner plans, especially if you want to catch a game and go for beer. This place is definitely a great option for drinks, their beer cocktails are super fun! The waiter I had for the night was super patient and kind--my whole table loved him. We ordered a bunch of apps between the four of us. The flatbread/pizza type and wings are nice but we definitely did not enjoy the cheese/bread bowl. Way too salty!"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is cheap beer if you order 3+ litres. The beer we ordered wasn't great taste wise but maybe it was just the specific one we ordered. This place was quite packed resulting in slow service and the food also took a while to come out. I wasn't blown away by the food at all but I would come back with friends for the beer."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch here.  The flat bread was decent and the beer was good.  They were actually brewing so you could watch the process.  The bartender was personable.  Overall, average pub food and decent beer."}
{"text":"Best beer battered fish and chips I have ever had. So soft and not too greasy. Ive had them 3 or 4 times and they have never disapointed.
I love this place because they have very nice appetizers, inluding spicey popcorn shrimp. Nice to go there late night and grab a small bite to eat and a couple of their beers. They brew their own beer so only have their personal beer to purchase.
The decor is very nice. Nice large bar in the middle of the place. Wish they had more lively music Friday and Saturday nights but its more of a chilled place."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here today and it was okay. 

I had the burger and fries. Our server said the fries were fresh and handcut, but they surprisingly tasted and had the texture of frozen. I wouldn't order the regular fries here again. She did recommend the beer-battered fries, but I'm not a fan of beer or battered fries. 

My burger was juicy, but the bun was really hard on the outside. It was kind of weird. 

Here's a tip, ladies: Don't wear short skirts or form-fitting skirts. These booths are killer to get into because the benches are high and very very close to the table. I almost flashed the whole restaurant getting into and coming out of the booth and it felt like the bench was molesting me on my way out. Do yourself a favour and wear pants or a maxi skirt.

My companions liked the beer, so come here if you're a beer drinker. The food is so-so."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Atmosphere was good able to have a meal and conversation. Staff extremely friendly and beautiful!!!i definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.. Good food and tasty beer . Ordered the fish and chips and the 3B burger both were equally delicious."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere... too bad about the food!  When we arrived we were seated and noticed about 5-10 tables full of dirty dishes, it looked like it had been there a while, and wasn't cleared the entire time we were there.  Food was just ok, edible but lacking flavour.  I ordered the LA wrap (grilled chicken, grilled veggies, avocado)  but it was steamed veggies, microwaved chicken and zero flavour.  Nothing was seasoned and nothing seemed fresh.  Afterwards I asked the waitress why the tables weren't being cleared... she said they didn't have a hostess and they were doing the best they could.  There seemed to be a lot of waiters carrying food back and forth so it seemed weird they would let that go, it was gross.  Wouldn't recommend and don't think I'll go back, if I do it won't be to eat."}
{"text":"So me and my girlfriend are walking along looking for a place to get a bite to eat and a nice beer.  She says let's go to the 3 brewers I haven't heard anything about the place.  I say ok... Vital mistake!  We get in at 735 and I must say that I am not a clock watcher I just happened to notice. Our server finally comes and we are really hungry so we order a couple of beers and a star platter, this happens at 7:50, our \"star\" platter comes after a reasonable 10 minutes ten more minutes and our beer arrives.  Almost a half an hour for our first round drinks!  The star platter had 3 mozzarella  sticks, a little handfull of onion \"scoops\" and 4 feeble sickly  potato skins.  So we ask for the bill, she brings it fairly quickly which was a pleasant change of pace, I pay and she then produced incorrect change, only off by 40 cents, and I know that sounds rediculous but still.  

The beer was really good though!"}
{"text":"Went there for a paint night event with my daughter. Our server tried hard to please and accommodate. It was the bartender that was the issue. In fairness, this IS a beer pub, but, if your going to serve cocktails, KNOW HOW to mix drinks. Sangria was meh and my daughter's cocktail was so off that she couldnt drink it. We stayed after the paint event and had dinner, which I must say was better than average pub food. The spinach and beet salad was excellent."}
{"text":"Was in there for a quick lunch. The meal was satisfactory. The Homemade Flammekueche dishes are the most interesting thing on the menu, and mine was good.  Being a beer snob, none of their beers impressed me at all."}
{"text":"Having not been to The 3 Brewers for a few years, I decided to drop by for a pint last weekend. We were greeted at the door and led through the maze of staircases to the back, where we were bombarded with loud music and echoing chatter from the tables around.

We both ordered a beer and it was quite good, even though I'm not a big fan of microbrews. The service was fast and friendly, although the servers definitely looked a bit overworked and had a lot of tables in their respective sections.

Overall an OK experience but nothing great. The music was definitely too loud and I was constantly shouting over it when trying to have a conversation."}
{"text":"At the south-east side of Yonge/Dundas, the ground level of this microbrewery+restaurant is consistently busy. I've been here several times mostly for its convenient location and options for beer. I particularly enjoy the white, blonde, and IPA beers. This place gets a lot of attention because you can order 4.5 oz taster glasses to try various brews. While decent, the beer here isn't by any means \"the best\" in the city. 

Food-wise, I've had the 3 Brewers Beer Chaser (medley of fried dill pickles, zucchini batons, breaded provolone, and potato twists for $10), chicken wings ($12), and Carbonade Flammande ($17). The portions leave more to be desired, especially for the price point ($85 before taxes for two people having 2 pints each and some appetizers). Taste of the food is like any other place like Jack Astor's or Boston Pizza. 

I really don't think Ryerson students frequent here often. This is more if you want to bring a family member or friend for a tourist experience in the heart of the city. You will have a good time, but you can find better places for the \"microbrewery\" experience. Since the food isn't amazing, you may just come here for drinks after having dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Been to a 3 brewers before so I knew I would enjoy it. Came here after a soccer game and the staff was very friendly. Our waitress took a while to take our order but our drinks came pretty quickly. Tried steak Flatbread and oh it was delicious. It was larger than I anticipated but not complaining. I would definitely come back to try the others. Also really enjoyed their amber beer."}
{"text":"Nice home brewed beer. Staff welcoming. Kids menu ok. S'mores as a dessert are. Good idea but sticking to the parchment paper. The carbonade tastes good. Had steak and frites. That was good. Should have tried the sauerkraut to compare with France."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends. We were pretty excited since one of us kept talking good about this place since he had been there. We went in and quite luckilyy the jays had won so it was all party on the streets and the restaurant. 
We got the taster beers (9 oz glasses 2 of each beer they had ) for 40 bucks in total . There were like 10 or so glasses. I personally would recommend the blonde or white beer. The others are too harsh.. Got a couple of pitchers and 2 platters . Came up to 100 bucks which was quite reasonable for a place right at Dundas Square. Food is decent and beer was good."}
{"text":"We went to the Richmond Hill location for Father's Day.  My husband is a huge beer fan!!  Our experience was less than good and mainly because of very poor basic restaurant management!  They ran out of many items...no Sprite, no mustard, no Churros.  The floor under our table had old menus and French fries.  The menus were dirty and ripped.  The food came out sporadically so that the hot food was cold by the time the salads showed up.  Then one of the salads had a hard piece of bright yellow plastic that looked like a ziplock bag sliding closure.  Luckily I spotted it before I put it in my mouth!!  The bathrooms were filthy and many stalls had no toilet paper. 
This restaurant has great potential but needs to needs better management!!!"}
{"text":"It has a good selection of beers, alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. Besides, it has a variety of finger food and steaks to go with your beer. You can find this pub in Quebec, Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa.

Today is St Patrick's Day and the pub does have a Celebrative atmosphere as it is playing scottish music . I also ordered a pint of green beer to try align to the festival. It tastes like a blonde beer and it's not cold. A new experience to me.

Cassoulet is a favourite dish from southwest of France. Slow cooked casserole of white beans, carrots, onions, bacon and garlic with braised pork belly, sausages and wing of duck confit. This dish is like a combination of soup and meat. The sausages are a bit spicy, the soup tastes good. Perhaps, it maybe even better to have a slice of bread to come with this dish."}
{"text":"Just your usual pub. I ordered a burger, it wasn't the best. Cool atmosphere and great service. I would go back just for drinks."}
{"text":"I tried the wings tonight.  I have had them before but tonight they were different and not for the better.  The \"hot\" option had a sticky sweet hot sauce on them.  Not very good by wing standards.  The manager was more interested in hanging out with her corporate counterparts at the corner of the bar than checking with customers on their experience here tonight.  If she did, maybe she would have learned how bad the music is.  The people who would enjoy this \"music\" can't even buy beer in this place."}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely be back!

Decided to come here on a Sunday night after looking for a late night local bar to hang out at, turns out they close at midnight! We were a large group, about 14, having a pre-wedding celebration. 

We arrived at 10:30 so considering how dead it was, we were seated right away. Most of us came for drinks. We ordered 3 litres of their blonde, it was massive.... Others ordered their own drinks. And someone orders the apple dessert, it was huge but soooo good!

I have a feeling this will be a regular go-to place for local late night eats, drinks and hang outs!"}

{"text":"An okay spot to meet up friends. They brew their own beer, which is OK, but nothing to write home about.
Food is average. 
Atmosphere is loud. I wouldn't say more so than other similar venues but for me it stands out here. Maybe because everything is average?"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were average - on par with any other similar resto-bar. What was terrible however was the service. We had to seek out and deliberately approach our server in order to ask for anything and on multiple separate occasions the individuals that brought our food ignored requests that we made (e.g. a spoon for something that needed a spoon, ketchup for fries). The servers were accommodating, but we had to search out a server anytime we wanted to order - the food delivery hostesses actively ignored requests. It made for a frustrating evening and given the large number of alternatives available I will never go back."}
{"text":"I straight up love this place!! Not only is the beer amazing , the food is great! Gonna keep coming back!"}
{"text":"$15 a pitcher of beer. What more can you say about that. Their shareable beer batter fries makes a great combo to snacking and drinking. In a mood for sweet? Apple crumble dessert with ice cream is a great sharable. It comes like a pizza with 8 slices. I mean...when's the last time you had a `sweet pizza`"}
{"text":"Still not impressed. Came with a party of 7 for our friends birthday. Ordered a bunch of apps (nacho, fried shrimp and flatbread) all tasted mediocre. The flatbread tasted more like deep fried wonton skin with salsa on the side, nacho was underwhelming and the shrimp was probably the best out of the three. 

I ordered the spicy sausage and olive flatbread but a pizza came out? The sausage was not spicy, the flatbread was dry and I seriously do not think my standards are high because food is food. He got the pulled pork sandwich which I think was a bit better than my flatbread. 

I got to try the special et cetera sampler which was a good choice aside from the hoppier beer but I still liked the selection overall. Would be nice if the waitress gave a description of the beer put in front of me (brand, where it's brewed, etc.). Our waitress was nice to give us a dessert on the house because it was our friends birthday. 

I would come back for drinks but not so much food."}
{"text":"I will never learn. Their food just isn't good. We came by for the game and ordered the Brewer Platter, soft baked pretzel and the duck confit poutine (which never came) and two beers. The platter consisted of 5 onion rings, a handful of riblettes, deep fried pickles and loaded potato skin. Everything was so dry and over cooked. I couldn't even get ketchup to mask the dryness of the food. The soft pretzel was probably the best.

Service here is good but our server disappeared halfway through our meal but it's fine because it was game night and we knew he was busy. I don't think I would come back to this chain. Not worth it."}
{"text":"(Avaliação em português abaixo! )

This was one of the first pub that I've been in Toronto and I really enjoyed the experience.
We were in a group of 8 people and the server was really kind and friendly. I asked her for individual bills, so we won't have problems with payment and she was cool with it.
They have a very well explained menu, where you can understand the type of beer that they offer before buying it. You can choose the size of your beer and the difficult thing for me was that the sizes were in 'oz' (I'm used to liters) but again, the lady was really helpful and helped me to understand the size that I wanted. I ordered a 18oz size (500ml), but after I regreted it because it's better (and cheaper) to buy the 36oz (1 liter).
I ordered a poutine and was classic and really good. It was a nice envirolment to be with my friends after class, relax and watch baseball. Not so expensive, I spent less than 20 dollares (tax and tips included).

Português:
Esse foi um dos primeiros Pubs que vim em Toronto e realmente gostei da experiência.
Estava num grupo de 8 amigos e a garçonete foi muito simpática e gentil. Pedi para ela fazer comandas separadas e ela aceitou numa boa.
O menu deles explica sobre os diferentes tipos de cerveja que eles oferecem. Você precisa escolher o tamanho da sua caneca que está em OZ, mas a garçonete me ajudou a entender e eu escolhi a caneca de 18 oz (500 ml), logo depois me arrependi, devia ter pedido 36 oz (1 litro), por que seria uma opção melhor e mais barata.
Pedi uma poutine para acompanhar e estava muito boa. O ambiente é bem gostoso para ir depois da aula, relaxar e assistir baseball. Nao foi muito caro, minha conta já com as taxas e a gorjeta deu menos de 20 dólares."}

{"text":"Very small portion of finger food. Had a poutine that's cold. Not very good food. Beer is ok. Atmosphere ok and not many people on a weekend."}
{"text":"decent place - came here after the tree-light up and fireworks at Nathan Phillips Square (so yes, my review is a little dated). 

It was SO packed, the wait was a good hour to get a seat, so we decided to make our way upstairs to the bar there and was lucky to find seats.

it was nice to catch the raptors game and the late hockey game as well.

We had a pint each and shared the fries. The service was good, attentive and the bartender answered all questions we had.

its a nice location with a lot of private space to have a party!"}
{"text":"My second (or is it third) visit to a 3 Brewers location and this didn't disappoint. Prior to their wider expansion, this location south of Dundas at the foot of Winston Park Drive was the original 905 location aside from the Yonge and Dundas Toronto location. I expected it to be out of date and sort of meh given the 3 star overall, but my experience was quite the amazing opposite of meh.

The space is huge, it's in the suburbs after all, high coffered ceilings, open views of their on site brewing facilities and a massive square bar which, like the Richmond Hill Location is the centerpiece of the restaurant. When I visited it was between lunch and dinner rush so the crowds were definitely lower.

Knowing now that each location has a custom brew, I went right for it and asked what awaited me. The Oakville Neighbourhood brew is a Vanilla Porter clocking in a about 5.8%ABV. Definitely will get you a little buzz after you drink one of their massive pints and it's delicious and smooth to boot!

I was torn between the french dip sandwich and the mac'N cheese grilled cheese, but my server advised me that I couldn't go wrong with the French Dip so I went with it - best decision I've made since switching to Gieco, saving me a ton of money on my car insurance! The beef is shaved perfectly and cooked to a succulent medium rare. Best of all it's still perfectly marbled so it maintains it's juiciness. It's cooked up and tossed with cheese and then scraped onto buttery garlic bread and served with thick gravy au jus and a salad or fries. 

It was easily one of the best French Dip... nay, one of the best sandwiches, I've had. End. Of. Story.

If you've never been to The 3 Brewers, give your head a shake and pay them a visit. If you've never had their French Dip, shake it again and make it a priority this week, actually tonight - ya tonight!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I was shocked! Shocked on so many levels - it's true! My one and only prior experience with this growing Canadian chain was subpar at best. The beer was watery, the food - meh, and the service lacking. All that changed the other day when I paid the newest location of 3 Brewers (in Richmond Hill) a visit.

This location took over for what used to be the Melting Pot (and several failures before it). The expanded and opened up the existing space and put a custom 3 Brewers spin on it matching the popular decor notes of today (reclaimed wood, no frills, iron, and Edison bulbs, etc).

I was greeted by 3 hostesses as I entered, all smiles and very sweet and then decided to sit at the bar as it was lunch on a weekday and the place was pretty empty. A server quickly came by and welcomed me, explained the restaurants concept and asked me what I'd like.

Having seen the reviews I knew I wanted to try this customer Richmond Hill specific review (Farmhouse) but played dumb and ask for her recommendations. She did one better and brought me an array of samples to try so I could see what I liked best. The Farmhouse ended up winning out and for good reason - it was incredible, such an easy drinking flavourful beer! I highly recommend it! As soon as I ordered my beer the bartender asked me if I would like to add fresh baked pretzels for $2? Sure I would, and I'm glad I did - they were massive! These soft, salty, chewy pretzels came in a pair and came equipped with two very distinct mustards. the first was a honey mustard while the other (and my favourite) was an extremely potent dijon mustard! Amazing, it even made my eyes water!

For my main, I wasn't super hungry but wasn't quite feeling a salad so I decided to go for one of their famous flammes! The name of the specific flamme I had escapes me now but I really loved the thin crust, the no hold bar toppings and how huge it was - definitely didn't hold back when attacking this dish.

Overall a great experience and I'm looking forward to coming back here soon!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Meh-diocre.

The menu is fairly standard - burgers, pizza, chicken wings, sauerkraut, and a good ol' attempt at a healthy salad - and things are reasonably priced. 

It's neat that the beer is brewed 'fresh on site' - but this also limits your selection. With nothing else, other than their own, you're stuck with a choice of 5 3 Brasseurs beers. The blonde is quite nice, but that day I really wanted a Rickard's white. Drat!

Don't try the pizza, it's fairly average and disappointing. And we all know, I love a good pizza. 

The staff was nice, but it was packed and service was a little slow. All in all, a very average dining experience."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a couple of friends.  We tried the Quebecois poutine, BC poutine and two flat bread pizzas.  The poutines were nothing special, the BC poutine which consisted of a chicken, bacon and BBQ poutine was just plain bad.  That combination of flavours did not work at all - yuck!.  We ordered the flat bread pizza because of all the past reviews of it being the only decent thing on the menu.  This also was not good, the crust was very dry and the toppings were very plain."}
{"text":"Best House Salad I Have Ever Had!!!!!!!!!
Didn't experience much of the menu but that salad will always stand out in my memory. I had the chicken club and still don't understand why they \"have\" to deep fry the avocado, totally negates the benefits and taste so that was just okay and since it was the day, I did not sample the beer selection but my co-diners enjoyed them.  It was a fun maze to the bathroom that lets you see the entire place which is very nice! But not something I would want to navigate while under the influence, lol"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and when my friends and I are looking for a place to just hang out, this is out place of choice! The waiters/ waitresses are so friendly, welcoming, and always joke around with us. It definitely adds to the fun, light-hearted environment. 

Give the meter of beer a try and let me know if you're able to finish it. 

I always go with a sampler beer since they're a micro-brewery along with any choice of flatbread. It's always a safe choice and sure to satisfy.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night for a quick drink with my girlfriend, and sat at the bar, we had a wonderful time thanks to a wonderful bartender named Ally, she really took care of us and was super attentive, but most importantly she made us feel really welcome and made us felt like we are a long time customer here, even though we've only met her the first time tonight. It was a really pleasant experience, and highly recommended, we also ordered the lamb shank and that was good too, the current feature beer is raspberry wheat which tasted almost like juice then beer,that was cool too. In conclusion, if u come here next time, sit at the bar and ask for Ally! You won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good eats always try some new from the menu. The beer oh the beer love it."}
{"text":"A great place to enjoy Beer on a Saturday night. Had an amazing time with my family. 

We ordered Poutines with Maxi Fries and Onion Rings since that was all we wanted to take in with the Beer and well, we have a little less variery in Vegetarian meals there... But the Poutine was amazing! We ordered it twice as a matter of fact! 

The place sometimes is really crowded and its difficult to call someone for service, but the waiters are all really friendly and really help u decide what will be best for u!

{"text":"Please stop serving the L.A. Wrap. It's awful. I had the seasonal beer, and that was pretty delicious."}
{"text":"Location/Service
- Located in East Beaver Creek, right out of the Highway 404 exit
- Plenty of parking available, but might be a little tricky as there are other restaurants around 
- Big restaurant with bar seating and table group seating available
- Inside is bright and lively atmosphere. Big glass windows to see how their beer is being brewed. Also big screen TVs available to watch sports
- Service is nice, staff are friendly (but may be a little slow cause a lot to tables to cover)

Food
- Been here a few times (didn't realize I never review nor take photos!), but their menu changes to season or around every 6 months
- Previously, tried their poutine/pizza. If available, highly recommended cause it's very consistent, large quantity and comforting. Lots of flavour choices to choose from. Pizza crust are also thin, perfect to my tasting
- Came recently for lunch, which they offer brunch items (i.e. egg benedict) and burgers. Tried their classic 3 Brewer Burger and switched it with Sweet Potato Fries (extra $2). Burger size and portion was great - soft bread, juicy meat and blend well with the arugula. Fries were also consistent and standard, adding it with the spicy mayo as a good kick

Drink
- They have a lot variety to choose from and staff are friendly in explaining different kinds of it if you don't have the knowledge
- Also have a flight deck for you to sample a few more if you're feeling adventurous 

Overall it's sort of my to-go place for a quick beer, watch a game with friends or coming here for a bit of bar food.

Tip - better to make reservations if possible cause it can get pretty busy!"}
{"text":"From the food to the service this place is just meh. I got the 3 Brewers burger and it was not very good at all. I love onions but there was way too much raw onion in this burger. The service was also not very good, the lady didn't even try talking to us until we were paying the bill. I got a pint of the white beer they make and it was okay but also not the best. Would not recommend coming here even if all you want is a burger and fries."}
{"text":"This is the newest location of 3 brewers uptown... about time!  They have a nice patio at this place and upon sitting down, the waitress offers 2 beer samples of your choice.  I think the beers are all made in-house (there are huge vats in the window area) and they have 2 nice mussel dishes as appetizers which i'm a fan of!

I normally prefer a lighter beer... like Coors light or mill st organic so everytime i come here, i get the white beer.  Right now they have a $20 special which includes a pitcher and a platter of fried foods (pickles, onion rings, ribs, potato skins)  I've been here twice over the past month, both on friday nights, and have not had to wait in line for a table.   I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"It was our friend's turn to pick a place for dinner. 3 Brewers was the choice. My friend(s) are easy to choose a microbrewery. I am right there with them. So we started with a fleet of six different beers. It was fun to define and taste each brew in order, comparing the bitterness, how it would taste with certain foods etc. I ordered the Roast Beef a Jus. Not a great cut of meat and it molded into the mozzarella. Fries were cold. My wife had mussels, also came cold. My friends enjoyed the ribs but the fish and chips were not quite up to par. The place was quiet, so not due to be overly busy, (snow storm happening...) I would go back for a pint or two, but as this place is located in a mass of restaurants, I hope they pick up a chef, even if they have to drop one of the three brewers. Sorry, better luck next time.

{"text":"I visited this place last Friday with a large group of about 10+ of co-workers and a few of their kids. The first thing I noticed is the different levels and all the stairs which reminded me of an old factory. I don't think beers and lots of stairs is a good combination. We went upstairs to an area with a large table and TVs. I thought that the speakers sounded unclear and the acoustics were horrible. I didn't bother with the Wi-Fi as I think I needed to sign-up. 

We waited at least an hour before ordering so that our whole group could arrive. Our server was extremely patient. She paid attention to us and cleaned up all our messes. Even the server who brought out the food was friendly.

I ordered the 3 Brasseurs burger and fries. It seemed small for $15 as the burger was a little bigger than the palm of my hand and the portion of fries was like that of a Harvey's restaurant. The burger should perhaps be less thick and more spread out with a larger diameter as it is a struggle to bite into. The burger patty was however thick, juicy and flavourful and didn't need condiments. I also asked for no lettuce and I forgot to check at the time, but I didn't see/taste any gouda or bacon. The food was filling enough but I could have used more fries. The 11oz glass of neighbourhood beer had a taste, perhaps a little bitter, that I was not used to but was not too shabby.

I paid by credit card and I thought that tips and percentage are up to the customer but our server automatically entered a tip which I thought was odd practice. I mean she did a good job so I would have left her something descent anyways. During our 2 hours my co-worker accidentally tipped my glass over and it broke, plus my supervisor's kid dropped half a burger patty on floor, and our server cleaned everything up. I wasn't sure if she was trying to save time because we had a large group or if that's normal business practice as she didn't inform me. I calculated that tip to be 18% after taxes (or 20% before). I wasn't charged for the glass that my co-worker broke so I didn't complain, but I always prefer to add the tip amount myself.

In conclusion the food is so so, but normally priced for downtown. The loud atmosphere is not my cup of tea, The staff were great, friendly and did an awesome job. We were initially trying to get a reservation for Jack Astors which wouldn't take one after 5pm on a Friday, but this place did it without any issues.The concept is great as they brew their own beer in-house but the experience just didn't wow me."}
{"text":"Short and sweet, my third 3 Brewers visited in less than a couple of months - I think I might have a small addiction going on here folks.

Their local beer to this location is Strawberry Saison, I sampled it and found it to be a tad on the watery side. Typically I like my saisons to be a little more full flavour, however their feature beer (an amber) was 6.2%ABV of golden amber glory. Loved it!

I had plans to try something new on the menu but then I saw the French Dip and game over. Long story short, they've added mushrooms to it... so I ordered it, ate  it and then drank the gravy at the end. Game Over.

Smaller bar set up than other locations but still amazing!

Ordered the salsa and chips, which came with about a pound of chips and only an ounce of salsa.  Had the sante fe salads my entree.  Way too much lettuce versus chicken or other ingredients.  Received about a gram of avocado.  Disappointing...

Beers were acceptable, actually.  I'm an avid homebrewer and very critical of beer.  Given that this is a chain restaurant, the beer was decent.  It saved the rating from being two stars.  Recommend the amber ale.  Ipa is terrible."}

I've gone to 3 Brewers a few times. We frequently have drinks at the one across from the Eaton Centre , and I've been to the one in Oakville and every time - I think the food is subpar. 

My friends have always said, you expect too much - it's a bar, you go there for the booze, but I've found bars that have had decent grub. It doesn't have to be either or. 

I ordered the short rib and Brie cheese flammekueches (sp?) and my friend swore by it, but it just didn't taste fantastic. It was alright, but I wouldn't reorder. It was way too greasy. 

Overall, if you're looking for a good pint, stop by - but if you're out for dinner? Go somewhere else. You can find more impressive food down the street."}
{"text":"Man, I came here right at 5pm with a friend and had good service. The food came super quick despite the crazy rush. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, with a side of veggies and sweet potato fries. My friend shared her mac n cheese grilled cheese (I wasn't too fond of it) but I loved my sandwich - and their sweet potato fries are KILLER! I wish we had gotten more water refills during the night, but it wasn't a total mood killer. Their beer there is fantastic and they give free really big samples, which I was very appreciative - you can never be too sure. I would definitely like to come again before the movies! I'd definitely suggest their signature the white beer - yum!"}
{"text":"Management REALLY have to review their cross contamination policy. Hint start with processes at bar. #NoDishWasher"}
{"text":"This is what I call a pub. The beers are good, not the greatest but the service is excellent and food fantastic. The carmelized onions chicken quesadillas are delicious. Many options for burgers and sandwiches. Flatbreads are also really creatively done."}
{"text":"We went before a movie. We ordered drinks when we first got there. Food took long, 40 minutes for calamari and mussels...we asked for the bill so we could leave immediately after consuming the food to make it to our movie. We shouldn't have tipped so early. 
Servers who weren't our waitress brought us the calamari and mussels and we never saw our waitress again. Nobody asked about us how our meal was and we had no drinks anymore. I had to walk to the bar and ask for water. Bartender at the bar seemed to have difficulty entering an order on a screen so I had to wait there to get her attention. Just a frustrating waste of time."}
{"text":"I would definitely avoid this restaurant. On the surface it looks like it has some potential for a place with decent food and good drinks. However, not only is the food bland, the service mediocre, but the management outright lies.

I ordered the \"Chèvre chaud\" open faced sandwich that was supposed to come with warm goat cheese. However, when it arrived the cheese looked and tasted exactly like Brie cheese. It had the Brie cheese rind with the distinct taste and texture. When I asked the waitress if it was goat cheese - she asked the kitchen who confirmed it was goat cheese. Even more, their flatbread that was supposed to come with the same goat cheese comes with Brie, and, the fresh herbs are simply dried.

However, the worst part came when the manager refused to admit it was Brie, offered to comp the meals, and then we were charged with the replaced food orders. There is ZERO customer service at this restaurant. Would NOT recommend this place to anyone. This is the quintessential tourist trap."}
{"text":"This place is huge! Multi-level with cool beer stuff everywhere. My only real issue with this place is that it's so dark! Reading the menu and taking photos without flash was almost impossible. There was lots of cool stuff I wanted to take photo of, but nothing would turn out. I was sad.

Got a flight of beer and the 3 Brasseurs Burger. It was so good. Handmade with gouda and bacon. You really can't go wrong. The beer was pretty good too! There was the Blonde, Amber, IPA and Brown. The Amber was my fav. Very smooth, a good balance between the IPA and the Brown.

Service was pretty good. She understood that deciding on beer and food was a challenge and was so patient! Would go back!"}
{"text":"The three brewers here is a decent spot for a beer and a bite. Its an absolutely massive place and you can get lost if you are not careful. 

I've had most of their beers and they are quite drinkable. The food is ok, I've had the flamemcruze ( the French style pizzas) with mixed success."}
{"text":"Food is good, lovely ambiance. But disappointed in cleanliness. During our second visit we were served a cup with lipstick on it. On the third visit, there was quite a bit of dried fruit next to the drinks menu. The waitress was justifiably grossed out and cleaned it up, but after the previous visit... i think they could step up their game a bit."}
{"text":"Access
Right across from Eatons. To be exact, it's less than 3 minutes if you exit from the Roots entrance. Bam, bam, bam.

Service
Believe it or not I had pretty good service. We visited the restaurant on the day Nuit Blanche was held and thinking it would take forever, we only had to wait 10-15 minutes. The lady at the front desk gave us an estimate of 25 minutes - this is the first time where someone overestimated the wait time. Our waitress was quite anxious to get our order and became increasingly difficult to find after the order. She was quite pleasant whenever she appeared but perhaps the restaurant was just too busy. I read in online reviews that service can be a bit slow so this is probably one area I would deduct some points.

The Good
Portions are gigantic, humongous, BIG. My friend ordered the homemade flammekueches which is short for thin pizza (Alsatian term). I'm not sure how the both of us finished this but needless to say it was quite tasty. I ordered the 3 brewers sauerkraut which includes sausages, grilled ham, veggies, and potatoes. Like I previously said the portions are huge and I devoured everything like a pig. BTW sauerkraut stands for \"sour cabbage\" and I hated it lol (just for you to know, has nothing to do with the restaurant). If you are coming for the beers, you have come to the right place. What I really like is that all the items are paired with a beer that they recommend. I also like how they have so many beer flavours and ordering half pints - YAY YAY YAY.

The Bad
Although the flammekueches was quite big, it also seemed a bit dry. But don't let that deter you from ordering it because there's always a first in everything. The sauerkraut boasted some good veggies but the sausages were lacking a bit in taste. They were juicy but when I think back to the sausages I had while dining in the Bellagio Buffet, this could not compare lols. I'm not sure if it's any better than the ones I buy from grocery stores, probably they weren't supposed to be heavily seasoned?

The Verdict
Awesome place to gather for drinks and probably even better if you like beer. If you are coming just for the food, please skip it because it's best enjoyed with beer. I say try it at least once but only come back if you miss the drinks."}
{"text":"Woooh! Definitely a cool spot! I absolutely love microbreweries, and this one is definitely in a good location! Located at East Beaver Creek, this restaurant is a keeper as it brings a unique flavour to the already diverse array of options. 

I didn't even know they were opened until I drove by it. Glad that I came by though! A nice choice of house beers and familiar foods. I wasn't too sure which beer I wanted for the evening, so the server eagerly gave me a couple samples to try before making my decision! Always a great way to start the night! I ended up with their house Blonde, which was a good choice.

For food, my friend and I got the Mac & Cheese Grilled Cheese and Sausage and Chicken (Shrimp) Pasta. The grilled cheese looked amazing, and my friend really enjoyed it. Cooler yet, they gave a spicy sauce to go with the fries! For the pasta, I can't eat crustaceans, so they subbed the chicken for the shrimp. Definitely a nice choice. A bright, red colour to the pasta was a bit if a surprise, but it was delicious, with a hint of spice to it. 

A great meal accompanied by great service always makes my night. The server came back to check on us without being bothersome, and provided excellent service overall. The overall ambiance felt more bar than restaurant though. The music was a little too loud, and it became harder to have a conversation with someone at the same table.

Definitely gonna make an effort to come back, as there were some amazing specialties on their menu that I would definitely wanna try. Not the cheapest restaurant around, so make sure your wallet is ready to try some of the more unique items."}
{"text":"Came by on a Saturday night without a reservation, so it was to be expected that we would have to wait. Surprisingly, we ended up getting a table within 15 minutes, and I was pleasantly surprised at how large the restaurant was. 

With basically 3 floors, there is definitely enough seating. With a bar on every floor, you will have no problem getting a drink anywhere.

Food is about the same here as every other 3 Brewers locations, and the Pretzels are definitely my favourite hands down! They had a promotion for a flatbread that came with a meter of beer as well!
Beers here are some of the best, as they are all brewed in house, and unique/local. They had a new size in the triton, but it wasn't yet available though it was on the menu. 

Service here was pretty good, and everyone moved quickly. There seemed to be good communication between staff as well. 

Definitely a good place to come for food and drinks if you're downtown, and every other place is busy. With all the tables, you wouldn't have to wait too long."}
{"text":"Great chicken wings baby!!"}
{"text":"I was done shopping at the Eaton centre and decided to find a place nearby for food and drinks. This place happened to grab my attention since it was so lively. As I went in I saw these huge microbrewery installations which looked really cool. I was then greeted by a friendly lady who seated me near the front of the restaurant. The front was completely open which allowed the restaurant to have great air circulation and it wasn't stuffy at all. The vibe there is fun, loud and up beat, many people are just pounding back pints. I started off getting their Brown beer which tasted like coffee, it was actually really good. I ordered the Québécoise poutine in Maxi (fries are dipped in beer batter) and it was delicious. I also ordered the Sante Fe salad which was fresh and had light dressing and the grilled chicken on top was moist and just perfect. Another main I ordered was the Homemade Flammekueches in Moulin rouge, it was flavourful flatbread with a kick. For dessert I had the chocolate molten cake with ice cream and I loved it. Even though this place was busy, my food took no longer than 5-10 minutes which was hella impressive! I will be coming back to try the different brews ;)"}
{"text":"I find it incredibly unfair that what is now my favorite place and the site of the best meal I've had in a long time is in Toronto, when I live in Pittsburgh. You locals better appreciate this little gem!

The only reason I even found Les 3 Brasseurs was because it was right next to a Hard Rock Cafe; as my traveling companion and I looked for lunch we were trying to find local chains, so we just happened to roll our eyes at Hard Rock only to have them fall on this place. Otherwise there really wasn't much to distinguish it from everything else on the street.

Once inside I promptly had to try one of the beer cocktails - why order beer on tap if you can try something made at the brewery itself - and was not disappointed by my drink, which was a white beer mixed with peach schnapps. Different then what I'm used to, but delicious and totally worth trying.

As for my main course? I went with the country open-faced sandwich, which is just a slice of French bread topped with basil, tomatoes, goat cheese and ham, which comes with a side salad and small portion of perfect french fries.

I really can't gush enough over just how scrumptious this meal was. It sounds so simple, it IS so simple, but it's the perfect mix of ingredients and the flavor of everything just melted together perfectly with every bite I took. The only downside I can even think of is that I didn't have any room for dessert, and really, what a silly complaint for someone to have: \"my meal was too good and I can't eat dessert!\"

I want to add that the service was also reasonable, no slower than any place is during a lunch rush.

5 stars from me. If I'm in town again, I'll be making a trip here immediately!"}
{"text":"I like this place. I like the music even though sometimes is really loud! But most of all, I like their nachos!"}
{"text":"Krysta is the best. My first time here and I will definitely come back here here. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"I went to the new 3 Brewers the other day because it finally opened up. I went after work around 6:15 pm, during the week.

I thought the place inside had a very open and modern look to it. They also were playing a music playlist with hits from the 90's ans 2000's. Brought back memories haha.

We were seated right away by the friendly hostess and were shortly after asked for our drink choices by a waitress. She told us the different beer they served and offered samples. I couldn't refuse the samples so i tried two; the blonde and the white beer. I was more a fan of the white beer - blonde was a bit too bitter for me.

We then ordered our food (we both weren't very adventurous today). We shared a plate of hot wings (yummm, they were really spicy) and I got the classic burger with caesar salad. I know our food chouces wasn't anything spectacular, but I was still surpised how bland the burger was. I also thought the caesar salad should have been a bit more garlicky.

We left there thinking our stay was average and nothing great enough to hype about to others. I wouldn't mind going again to try something different, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Every time I come here this place is worse. While the beer is cheap and fairly decent and they've made some good effort into getting cocktails on the menu as well. The food and service have suffered immensely. 

Our server was an older woman, while super nice and friendly, didn't have a lot of menu knowledge (she didn't know how many Oz the burgers were and didn't know the spirits in some of the cocktails). She was also very slow for not being that busy.  Slow service is fine if a server makes a point to say they're busy or if they apologize for a wait. But waiting 10 minutes for our drinks which were just beers seemed excessive. 

The burgers were very small for what you pay for. A slightly smaller patty to doublestack would be ideal. The sweet potatoe fries were delicious and still some of the best on Oakville though. I find myself coming back here for cheap beer often. But the food has gone so far down from where it used to be."}
{"text":"This was the third time I had visited this location with friends, and every time it has been just \"ok\". I go because it is usually a gathering and others in the group will pick it because it is central to everyone. This particular time, we went for a late lunch on this past Monday, and my friend pulled out what seemed to be a man's body hair from his pulled pork sandwich near the end of finishing it. Most of us were already finished our meal and it totally turned our stomachs; of course these mistakes happen, we are all human, nevertheless - no one wants to experience it! The waitress came over and was shown the hair and rather crudely asks \"Well what do you want me to do with it?\", no apologies. My friend says he doesn't want anything else instead, and instead offering to get a manager or making the situation less awkward she runs away with the plate and we sit for a long period of time. The floor manager then came over 15 minutes later and apologized and took care of the situation, but it was just all handled very oddly and I don't think I'll be going back after this experience."}
{"text":"For the first time in a long time I had beer (with  few other people) at the end of a work day. The beer was surprisingly pretty good, and the ambiance was solid too. I had a delicious platter for dinner and it was the perfect pairing to the beer that I shared with three other people. It is a great spot for people who want to relax after a work day, but I think it's suited to the small group that we had (especially if you want to eat and drink outside). Overall, an awesome eating experience."}
{"text":"It's tight but cozy. The beers are great. Not a lot of choices but what they do have is done well. I had the mussels and fries and they gave a large portion of mussels and lot of fries. The mussels were plump and juicy and just the right amount of spicy. 

Oh I did forget to mention a couple of the mussels weren't cleaned well unfortunately (had gravel). But only one or two so it wasn't a big deal. 

Overall a good time!"}
{"text":"its a hit or miss, we went there twice and the blonde margarita on the first night was delicious!!!!! the service was slow (unsure why as it wasn't that busy), polite service but incredibly slow, we watched our drinks sit on the bar ledge for 10 minutes instead of being served to us... my husband is from Quebec - which is the reason we went! - and he loved the poutine, said the poutine gravy/sauce was legit lol

the second time there, the blonde margarita was literally just a cup of foam, it was NASTY!!! the sangria was good... we ordered the duck confit poutine, beef short ribs, white mussels and the chicken and waffles... the chicken and waffles were personally my fave, the duck was flavourless, white mussels and beef totally mediocre"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to try a variety of beers that they brew in house.   I love the free samplers they give for their featured beer.   I once tried a chestnut beer and it was delicious even to a non beer drinker. 

The food was mediocre.   I had the 3 brasseries burger and it was pretty dry.   But maybe it depends on the night as I've had it there before with a much tastier result.   

Lots of TV's and a bar area to watch sports.   I just hate parking there."}
{"text":"Due to a lack of Mexican restaurant we landed here for a late lunch when walking around the city. It was OK. They have their own beer and traditional pub like food. Overall a good  place for lunch. 

They do have free Wi-fi which is a bonus!"}
{"text":"Would give it 3.5 stars if I could. 

Tried their smoked meat burger. It was decent I just hoped there were more fries. For drinks, I tried their amber and blonde beer and while both were good, I liked the blonde better. And as for dessert, we got cheesecakes which were just a tad bit too sweet. I liked the ambiance but my only complaint is the service. The waitress didn't seem too courteous. For example when we were seated, she asked what drinks we wanted and I said water and she didn't even acknowledge the other person with me and brought water for them as well. Also, when I asked if we could keep the menu because we knew we were gonna order more food/drink, she said she'll just be around and if we want anything more, we can ask her to give us the menu again which I found unnecessary. Had a good experience overall."}
{"text":"went there twice within two weeks for lunch with a friend and dinner with my wife. The flatbread is really good, highly recommend. the rest of the food are average, sandwich, tuna poke, and sauerkraut tasted so so. beer will be a bit above average, nothing really surprises me."}
{"text":"We had fun talking here, but the service was not very good, making for an odd evening. My friends and I came here as we were wandering around the \"Toronto Times Square.\" Our waiter was a little snarky when we couldn't pronounce the french name of our dessert (which was essentially like a pizza-sized fried dough with caramelized bananas) :(

For beverages, we tried the sampler, and that wasn't bad. I think the special was one brewed with Asian spices (??) which included cardamom (??) The white ales were pretty refreshing, but I have an allergy so I couldn't try too much of it. :("}
{"text":"I ate here last night base on reviews about the fish n chips. The fish was perfectly cooked and not greasy at all. The amber beer was great tasting and went down very smooth. The sweet potato fries were the best I have ever had. 

It was so good I came back to try something else tonight. Their bacon cheeseburger was delicious and perfectly cooked. The sweet potato fries were better than the first night. The brown beer was extremely smooth and tasty. 

I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"3 Brewers is good. Good food good booze, I dont want to sully the place over one employee. However, Christ I never thought Id do this in my life, I have to talk about what just happened. Walked in and the bartender COMPLETELY ignored me. He looked a little busy with bar related tasks, but the place was pretty dead so...Then mans starts flirting with the hosts (I dont blame him). Tried to make eye contact with him and he still completely ignored me. To his credit his man bun was on point and he looked hella dapper, but what he did was unprofessional and thoroughly annoying. So I walked out. Good place, bartender needs a fine tune. Ive been going to bars for 6 years now and this has never happened before."}
{"text":"Come for the food - stay for the beer.

I have been to L3B a few times and have enjoyed myself each time.  The food itself is typical bar-style fare, and while it isn't too shabby, the beer is what really sets it apart.  I definitely recommend the 1 liter varlets that are between 8-10 dollars.  The beer itself is decent quality and is certainly a superior value than what you would find elsewhere.  Whenever I go with friends, we can sip on a varlet for an hour and a half before its gone!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night for friends birthday. We were there for paintnite and had food along with their beers! The food was really good including the popcorn shrimps. Good spot!"}
{"text":"While the beer was good the service was really bad. I had to wave the waitress down while sitting at the bar she kept disappearing, her reply was that she was taking care of all the tables too. Mind u this was during a leafs playoff game as well, would the management not hire more help. Never going back, but have had better experiences at other 3 Brewers in Toronto such as Yonge and dundas."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give the place 2 and a half stars.
Came here looking for something better than the fast food that smothers the Yonge and Dundas intersection. The décor is gastropub to a T, and the place is full of twenty somethings texting to each other across the table.
They have a good selection of beers and an inexpensive and small wine selection, so there is plenty to choose from without breaking the budget.
The food is okay - definitely edible, but not great. The poutine is quite tasty but small, and the cheese curds were in large chunks so they didn't melt. The Caesar salad was good, though once again, on the small side. The charcuterie platter was disappointing - the cheese and salamis were ordinary store bought stuff, but the cornichons and pickled eggplant were nice. The tuna tartare was okay, but the tuna wasn't the highest quality and the guacamole on top had so many other ingredients in it you couldn't even taste the avocado.
That's kind of the story about the food - everything was okay, but it was either too small or definitely could have been better. This is a place where you come to drink and have something in your stomach while your drink, not a place to go eat and have something to drink with your meal."}
{"text":"The patio itself was inviting, filled with flowers and darling wicker chairs. The masculine-chic decor inside though, was what drew me in. From barrels to chandeliers, and cute hanging industrial lights. The entire brewery station was neat, but even neater, the sweetest chrome centre peice above the bar. 

Beer Mussels were divine! I've always loved wine mussels, but for a beer girl like myself I could've easily eaten two plates. I ordered the Tuna Nicoise and was not dissapointed. The Tuna was not very well seasoned and was a tad bland,  but perfectly well balanced by the salad dressing. Overall, a great experience. I loved that they offer you taste samplers on all of the beer they craft. It can get pretty overwhelming for an indecisive person like myself. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Ok. Let's get this straight. They make their own beer, and if you want a chug-a-thon they have meter stick and personal kegs for your table. You can even craft your own beer and come back when it is ready and drink it with your friends. 

The food complements drinking, but is limited in choices and is costly. 

By far, the only thing I would order is their pretzels. They are the gold hidden amongst the rock. 

So to re-cap: if you like beer, drink it here. If you like food--stick to the pretzels ."}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere and good selection of menu items. Surprisingly, heard at least a couple people from our group less than impressed with the beer they had but perhaps it just worked out that way and could differ if they had chosen different types. Burger seemed a little less tasty than would be ideal (burnt tasting) and the side of poutine (including its size) was nothing to brag about.

Complaint: We went in celebration of my girlfriend's birthday and I informed our server of that in hopes of getting her acknowledged in that regard (and the server did respond in recognizing the message I was relaying) - nothing ever came of it, though."}
{"text":"Good service, good beer and good food. Will come back. Had the 3L triton definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Quiet place on a Sunday lunch outing.  They have a great variety on the menu to please even the pickiest eater. 

We ordered the beer soaked shrimp and beet salad, popcorn shrimp, and small house salad.  No complaints on the food and the service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"So my bestie and I decided that we would try 3 Brewers out for the first time.  I heard good things about it, although my experience from another location was awful.  I decided to give this location a chance.  We walked in and were seated right away and it was pretty packed.  There are a lot of TVs throughout the whole place, as well as a large screen projector at the back of the restaurant.  The bar area was very spacious and nightly lit.  The washrooms are nice and clean as well which is an added bonus.  Once we were seated.  We were able to take a look at the menu to see what they had to offer. Their food menu was interesting, looked like an old newspaper.  We were then greeted by a young lady who introduced herself to us and asked us if we decided on anything to drink to start with.  My bestie ordered a glass of Rose wine and I ended up ordering a Blonde beer.  As for food, she decided to go with their Mac & Cheese Grilled Cheese Sandwich and I got their Duck Confit Poutine.  My bestie said that their food was good, but very heavy and filling.  My poutine was delicious as well, not as salty as I thought it would be (that being a good thing, because from my previous experiences, my duck confit was extremely salty!).  Another waitress that served us our food, mentioned to us that the Duck Confit Poutine was one of their newer items on the menu and it was voted one of the better tasting poutines they offered, so I was definitely glad to hear that.  The original waitress we had was super friendly and patient with us and she politely let us know she was done for the evening and let us know someone else would be taking care of us.  Overall, I had a great experience here with good company, and I will definitely be coming back to try a couple of other items on the menu that caught my eye."}
{"text":"Went back with the family for dinner this time. Wow, it was quite a different experience. 

The food was very good this time, and the atmosphere was amazing for hanging with the family. Was different from lunch because there were more people and it didn't feel as dead. Also tried the pretzel and it was amazing. Will have to go back again just for that. 

I also didn't pay this time around so don't know the price of our bill

Pros.

Friendly service
Free beer tasting
Great Food
Felt like a bar this time.
The Pretzel was awesome. 

Con

Nothing I can think about right now."}
{"text":"HUGE place.  We were there on a Sunday, but the 3rd floor was closed.  The food selection is pretty great.  I thought the beers were interesting, and I like all kinds of beer, but nothing really struck me as great.  Probably just 2 or 3 star beers, if you ask me.  

The service was outstanding, however.  Our waitress was knowledgeable about the beer, asked us quietly what the kids wanted to drink (understanding that some parents don't want their kids to drink soda, you, my dear, get a +5 in my book), and made suggestions.

It's definitely worth a shot."}
{"text":"Obviously, you're here for the beer and not so much for the food. Came with two other friends to catch a basketball game. Was seated quickly at a table and ordered a 1L blonde with the beer chaser (for 2), while another friend got the premium et cetera. The blonde had a light flavor and was pretty good. The food was alright but wish there was a bit more even as a shareable. Service was friendly and refilled our waters regularly. However the initial order took awhile to arrive, mainly the pitcher of beer. We had to check on it multiple times after it arrived way later than our friends beer tasters. That being said, the beer is decent here if you're solely looking for that. Also they have redesigned the parking around the area (its free if you go to the restaurants indicated in the signs) so its a bit more confusing - just be careful of where you park."}
{"text":"I am writing this review because, surprisingly my grandson, Mars is the biggest fan of this restaurant and experience.  He loves the beer battered chicken fingers so much that he requests coming at least a few times a month.  We always have friendly service and the place is gorgeous, warm and comfortable.  So many nooks and cranny's to dine in! I would love to host a large dinner here just to share the tour, food, and brews!  We will be back and we would love to bring others into this many leveled dining and brewing experience.  Love!"}
{"text":"3 Brewers is a great little brewery for sure! I do love the brews here as well as the atmosphere for sure! I am of fan of darker beers so of course I loved the brown they offer.the beers come in 3 different sizes,6,18 and a 36 (which is a bargain) by the way !Multiple levels of bars and dining areas as well! 

The food here is rather unique and tasty as well! The maxi  fries are pretty bad ass and happen to be battered! Yum! Tasty, crispy! The sausage and kraut is great as well!

I'll certainly come back here when I'm in the Toronto area for sure!"}
{"text":"The only thing that keeps me coming back here is probably their beer. They have a good selection of beer that can cater to those who like light to dark taste. They brew their own beers so you can expect some special flavours every month or so. 

Their food is ok, kind of overpriced. 

I've tried their burgers, calamari, beer battered maxi fries and nachos. I would order their burgers again, which tasted pretty good and it is good portion size. I would also order their beer battered maxi fries again. They are fresh and super crispy; can't compare them to the regular fries. The fries would be the best to order for their value and if you're looking for something to munch on while chatting with your friends

The place is spacious and they have a patio that you can enjoy in the summer."}
{"text":"Nice place for a group of people to go! Good food and great beer! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, adequate food, fair prices.  I won't go back.

During my visit for dinner and drinks at the 3 Brewers, I was reminded how important service is.

The restaurant is casual and relaxed, their beer and cocktail selection is unique and from the outside, this looked like a great place to enjoy a dinner and drinks with friends.

However, we received such poor service that our evening was ruined.  Simply put, our server didn't want to be there.  She was slow, unresponsive and while she made an effort to apologize for our lousy service with sarcastic jokes, it was clear that she could care less.

I had \"Les 3 Brasseurs\" hamberger.  All of their burgers start with mass produced, frozen patties and are topped with a couple of different choices to make them unique.  There wasn't anything special about the meal.  This pattern extends to their entire menu - adequate bar food with a couple of interesting sandwiches - but nothing that would draw you back.

They have a variety of custom beers available.  They're good and I would have enjoyed sampling a few different types of them if our server was available to help us.

I don't recommend Les 3 Brasseurs / The 3 Brewers.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"So far I've been here a couple times since they've opened and honestly I have to say it's a must try! I always get the beer sampler which I consider a fair amount of beer for someone who hasn't made up their mind as to what they would like or wants the variety. I also seem to stick with the roast beef dip sandwich on garlic bread which is to die for. 

I must say - their sweet potatoes fries are possibly the best I've had in a long time. 

I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"This location isn't all that great. I've been to the Mississauga location by Winston Churchill and didn't have any complaints. 

I went to this location for a birthday over the weekend and the food and service was just horrible. 
I ordered the Beer-Braised Pork Shank and it had absolutely no flavour! I had to drown it in salt and pepper and asked the server for some bbq sauce - which btw never came. 

Our server took forever to take our orders and she never checked in on us once. There was also a mix up with the bills at the end of dinner which took another 10-20 mins to sort out.

Please don't go here for dinner, everything is pretty bland and over priced."}
{"text":"We were there the Friday? before the long weekend. I ordered the quinoa salad and it had approximately 1 tbsp of quinoa and the salad greens were so soggy they were probably from the freezer. 
We were celebrating a birthday and the manager game over and said..I guess we'll have to give you something..and his tone was of annoyance..and they then did not bring anything for the birthday girl.
The beer was good and our waitress was fine.
The whole experience was disappointing and I will not go back as there are so many better places in that plaza"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this restaurant. The atmosphere is really rustic. Love the lighting. Just enough to chill and have a drink or to have a nice dinner. The beers were pretty good. I'm not crazy about beer but the fact they make their own is worth a try. The poutine was OK. Nothing special. Could use a bit more gravy in my opinion. All in all, its a cool place to chill but to me, nothing special."}
{"text":"Great craft beer that they brew. Had a flight the black ipa which is a limited offering was my favorite. Had the hot wings which were better than average. The sauce is where it was at"}
{"text":"This is my first visit here. I received a coupon by mail for a free Flamm of choice. I decided to come in and check them out.

As soon as we entered the establishment we received a warm welcome by two lovely ladies. Then we headed to our spacey booth. We ordered a Manhattan Flamm from a menu that resembled a newspaper and washed it down with a pitcher of their freshly brewed amber beer (so fresh the brewery containers are right next to you!) then ended the night with chocolate hazelnut dip sweets. (pictures below)

Flamm was fresh and delicious. Crispy thin crust right out of the oven. Amber beer was fresh, smooth, and not bitter. Chocolate Hazelnut is a must! Prices are very reasonable. Staff are wonderful and clearly love doing their job.

I strongly recommend this establishment to all beer lovers, Flamm lovers, sweets lovers, and business owners who are still wondering why their establishment has a rating of 3 stars or below on Yelp!"}
{"text":"Took my friend here last night for an early birthday dinner to celebrate her 25th. The atmosphere is nice- it's not too loud and not too quiet, so you can have a good conversation as long as you're seated at one of the booths. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and my friend ordered the chicken & avocado sandwich, both with fries. The meals were pretty much what we expected them to be, nothing too exceptional but nothing to complain about. We also ordered dessert as well- I ordered the creme brûlée which was a little on the watery side, but still had a nice taste to it (minus the glazed top that was too hard to eat). My friend ordered the hibachi DIY s'mores, but when they brought it to our table, it was just regular marshmallows in a bowl with graham crackers. We had to ask the waiter if it was the right thing, since the picture and description clearly says that you get to have a \"campfire at your table. She says \"oh you ordered the normal s'mores\" as opposed to the \"hibachi s'mores\"to which we pointed out that there is no such thing as normal s'mores on the menu. I guess she then realized she had made a mistake, and offered to bring the correct dessert, which we appreciated. All in all it was a nice evening, nice atmosphere, and nice food. Would go again!"}
{"text":"Great beer brewed right in front of you and a nice selection of pub faves. What more can you ask for? I have been here a couple of times before. This time I was with 2 friends for dinner. I had the pork shank which was huge and totally satisfying. The service was friendly and quick. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What was once such a welcome addition to the area, has gradually devolved into a mediocre restaurant.  

The beer crafted in house is great, but the food no longer.  Several of the good dishes were taken off, such as the Niçoise salad.  What was once the best and freshest tasting onion soup is now one of the blandest and badly cooked.

Did they have a true French chef in there to start, and things fell apart afterwards?  Regardless, I gave them several opportunities and it only seems to be getting worse."}
{"text":"The 3 Brewers Is a great way to place to hang around. Loved the bear and the food. The service was good, but the server looked pissed and was serving food as if he didn't want us to be there."}
{"text":"very impressed! my friends and i simply ordered 4 maßkrugs (1 litre varlet) - as we had already eaten lunch - and had a great time. I will be returning for food next time and have heard that the pulled pork sandwich is excellent. Updated review coming soon."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night, wasn't too busy. We ordered appetizers, entrées and dessert, unfortunately we received one wrong order but the server kindly corrected it and we were compensated. 
The food is reasonably priced but taste is somewhat bland, doesn't stand out from other restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"A mediocre spot by Yonge and Dundas to meet up with friends or go out after work.

You would think being a \"brewery\" and brewing their own beer that the beer would be something above average, but it was really nothing to rave about. The food is also average as well. I split the nachos with some friends and we all agreed it would've been more worth our time and money to make better nachos ourselves. Some other friends ordered different items and for the quality, the menu seemed over-priced.

A good thing about this place is the atmosphere - it's pretty lively and the place is fairly large (multiple levels) so there is lots of space and seating.  Service was decent given the size and busy-ness of the place, but the food did take a while to come out. 

If you are looking for something easy and centrally located, this will probably do the job, but other than that it's very average."}
{"text":"Apparently, I passed by this place a million times and the big sign says \"3 brewers\". I know some French, but I never knew this was what it was referred to and was the same place as Les 3 Brasseurs.  

Ambiance/Feel: Really cool and neat.  It felt really chill without feeling too dive-y and not douche-y either (it's Friday, my English is broken).  I was also impressed by the newspaper menu's.  It was unique (yes I'm impressed by little things).  Just the overall vibe seems awesome and I hear it's 3 floors though I only saw 1. They also brew their own beer .  

So 4/5.

Service: Ahh...I hate judging service. I arrived earlier than my friends, being the not-so-fashionably early type and the waiter came around 3-4 times within 10 minutes to see if I wanted something to drink besides my water.  When one of my friends arrived about 10 minutes later, he didn't come around for about 5 minutes, strangely enough.  But they are busy and the guy was very  nice, so I have to give 3/5.  

Food/Beverage:  I ordered a shrimp and baby salmon pizza that had onions and veggies on top.  While I liked it, I think calling it a pizza is a bit of a misrepresentation.  It should be called \"seafood bruschetta\" or something like that.  That's what it tasted like.  Don't get me wrong, but I thought a pizza would at least have some melted cheese on it.  I know, it wasn't listed as one of the ingredients, but sometimes I go dumb and just make assumptions, but still.  For taste and creativity of the food: 4/5.  However, as my friend so \"delicately\" pointed out to the waiter, the pizza was barely sliced. I could literally pick it up by the corner and pick up the entire pizza with no risk of it coming apart. As for the beverage, ordered a Blonde beer and it went down fairly smooth, sort of like a Heineken or something.  So overall, I would give it 4/5 for food/beverage, but loses 1/2 star for pizza not being cut.  3.5/5


Final judgement: Cool place to hang out while at the Eaton Centre or Yonge/Dundas square and awesome location. 3.5/5.  Since I'm in a good mood, I'll round up."}
{"text":"Despite crazy lineups, this place is awesome if you're a beer person! There's always something to try & the staff always have great recommendations. I've had their beer flights and would definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place whenever I am around Yonge-Dundas. They have really great food and a great selection of brews to choose from. They have a second level where they can seat more people which is closer to the washroom however, I still prefer the bar or main level seats. Great place to have brews you can't get anywhere else."}
{"text":"Came here because it's listed as a brewery, and while yes they do brew their own beer you can only get it if you eat at their restaurant.  No bottle, can, growler fill or keg.  In their defence 3 brothers may not have listed themselves as a brewery.  Just don't come here for a pick up of beer, do come for food."}
{"text":"Microbrewed beer - always a fun occasion.

I really enjoyed their amber - it's really refreshing and has a hint of fruity flavours with a smooth bitter end. Worth the try.

Food wise, I had their flatbread pizza. Tried the Moulin Rouge. That was really fantastic. The crust is actually the best part. Try it with the smokey chipotle hot sauce. Yum!

The sausage and sauerkraut dishes did nothing for anyone's life. Sauerkraut was tasteless - and I love that stuff... And the sausage, uninspired. Just boiled. The pork shanks were good, but the portions are the size of your head.

Also, totally check out the barrels of peanuts. It's really cool that you can pick up a bag but freshness is put into question.

They have an upstairs for larger groups. The location is great, right by Eaton's center and honestly, the ambiance was cool."}
{"text":"Came here on June 18 for dinner.  This has always been my \"go to\" place since it opened.  Having their own brew made in house just makes it that much fascinating!  The view of the brewery inside the restaurant adds that extra touch of freshness.  Now let's start with the menu.  My favourite entree has always been the bbq pulled pork on a toasted white baguette.  The crisp texture of the bread adds a \"beaucoup\" mouth watering combination with the soft texture pulled pork and crisp texture of the baguette.  Some places seem to leave the pulled pork drench in its own fat but destroys the bread by making it soggy within minutes.  Now let's head to the in house beer.  I have always been an ale or lager person but I was blown away by the flavour of their beers.  Beer from the tap always add a refine taste than from a can or bottle.  Having it freshly made adds that perfect touch.  My favourite is their blonde and white beer with full bodied strong flavours.  C'est parfait!"}
{"text":"Three brewers have a few locations in the GTA, this one looks new and modern and very spacious inside. They brew their own beers here. Cool fermentation tanks to observe while you eat and watch sports on TV.

Third time here and on a weekday night, first time not needing to line up compared to their weekends dinner time rush.

Their liege waffles are a must have for dessert, so good, similar to Wandas belgian waffle style and comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. They are small so shouldnt have trouble finishing it after dinner.

Best thing to get here for dinner are the flatbreads, similar to a very thin crust pizza, but different. The steak one was well done. Prices are in the $15-19 range. Burgers and fries are good too.

The service here was a little absent tonight. We had to ask for water a few times as the waitress forgot and then only brought one glass when I asked for a refill and one new glass. Thus minus one star.

Depending on where you sit (i.e. the bench seats), you may have blue lighting which makes it impossible to take any good food photos... for example from tonight :)."}
{"text":"My friend was visiting from out of town and I suggested 3 Brewers as the destination for our lunch date. 

IWe opted to sit outside and were greeted right away and our server explained the beers to us. We opted for the 4 beer taster that had everything from a brown to a white. Beers were pretty good! 

I ordered the Mediterranean chicken salad and baked pretzels, he ordered some kind of pizza, and his girlfriend ordered the cassoulet with a side of poutine.

I found my salad uninspired and couldn't figure out what was Mediterranean about it other than the one piece of pickled artichoke heart and feta cheese in there. Portions aren't the biggest and I was glad I ordered their pretzels. Those came as a set of 2 with a honey mustard and dijon mustard for dipping. Both sauces were good and so were the pretzels.

My friend's pizza was massive! Thin crust and a generous amount of toppings. He seemed to enjoy it, but his girlfriend blatantly didn't like it. Poutine seemed small for the price and the fries didn't seem fresh cut.

The cassoulet was the least favourite thing of the afternoon. It was oversalted and underseasoned. The texture didn't sit right with any of us. It came with garlic bread and salad.

Service was good; our server was quick and seemed to know the menu."}
{"text":"Great patio. I didn't try any beer.  The menu is interesting but I assume the food is secondary to the beer.  Lots of flatbreads to choose from. But I was craving a burger so I had the 3B burger - it was...OK.... Service was good. I'd return."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night to hang out. And for a Monday evening, this place was quite busy. Which says good things about The 3 Brewers in Richmond Hill. They do have great beer that was made like a micro brewery and they were advertising about the Raspberry flavoured beer. Enough with the plugging. 

I ordered the Lilloise Flammekueches (wafer thin pizza). This has always been my go to dish and I shared with my friend. Then we decided to order the chicken club poutine. At first it came out a bit on the lukewarm side. But the server kindly took it back to the kitchen and had it heated up even more, which we appreciate greatly. Both dishes tasted great and surprisingly, we were full."}
{"text":"Very clean, simple and nice interior. Food was good. Servers were friendly. Got myself lamb shank, beer mussles, and chicken quesadillas. My unique drink I got was beer Caesar."}
{"text":"The 3 brasseurs burger wasn't all that. You could tell the pattie wasn't made from fresh and the bun was just your standard burger bun. This place gets really busy, however the wait time is reasonable.15-20 minutes depending on when u get there in the afternoon/evening. I've tried other items on the food menu, but nothing was really that great. Being somewhat of a soft spoken person, the noise level was insane."}
{"text":"First time coming here and first Yelp review. 

We were a party of 10 attending a farewell lunch for some colleagues at work. Among our number were a number of beer appreciators.

The service was rather slow, though they thoughtfully provided free pitchers as an apology. Unfortunately the only beer available is the house stuff, with terrible metallic flavours. We tried the amber, samples of the witbier and the IPA. Unfortunately all were off in flavour and very disappointing."}
{"text":"Could have been worse I guess. The service was pretty slow, ok really slow.  Took 15 before someone took our drink order. 
The beer was probably what saved this visit from being a one star. I ordered the burger because it seemed like the safest bet. They had steak tartar on the menu, really?  Anyway. The burger was a thin over cooked slab of beef. There was supposed to be blue cheese and Brie, if there was it must have been the smallest pieces because I couldn't taste either. 
The fries were ok."}
{"text":"Some people can be quick to point the finger but im going to the 3 Brewers the benefit of the doubt.  Im going to base my review on how I liked this places before I had an issues.  I will explain...shortly after I ate I began to get the sweats and was very sick to my stomach.  This comes 15 to 20 mins after eating my meal.  We were a group of 6 and I seemed to be the only one that was sick so for this reason I want to say that something just didn't agree with me.  Our server was amazing.  Quick, polite and professional.  We shared 3 apps for 6 people.  Tasty deep fried goodness.  Our entrees all came out at the same time and no one had any complaints as to how it was cooked.  It will be a while but I will visit the 3 brewers again."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at this restaurant. We had chosen this place for its patio, however since we had 8 people they were unwilling to accommodate us outside and we had to sit indoors. The food was okay for most of us. One person in our group ordered salmon and it arrived 50 minutes later as the rest of us were done and ready to get back to work. They did give him the food to go and gave him just the salmon for free, but still frustrating."}
{"text":"This place has gone down!!!! I've been here twice these couple weeks. We walked in the first time and no service.. we have to complain to the manager because the attitude of these waitress are unbelievable. One of the waitress smell very bad. His week the same waitress smell very bad. We had to complain to the general manage and he didn't seems like he cares. The bartender still have a attitude problem. We will never come back!!!!"}
{"text":"The beer is great and a fantastic value. Hands down the best beer place probably in all of Markham/RH.

Food is pub fare and nothing really that stands out but does the job. 

Service has been consistent and good the few timed I've visited this location. Make sure to sign up for the rewards program which is fairly generous IMO."}
{"text":"The 3 Brewers is a cavernous brewpub decked out quite fancily with tin ceiling tiles and a beautiful, shiny copper bar top that defies description. The house ales cover the spectrum from extra dark to white and land in several spots on the ABV scale.  The service was prompt and very friendly and made me feel right at home.

While they were out of the neighborhood beer, I found the blonde ale to be the perfect session drink, and my friends and I tried several appetizers.  Note: as in many Canadian eateries they bread their hot wings here, but the 3 Brewers' wings are miles (kilometers!) better than the specialty wing shop down the street ... and don't get me started on the poutine oh dear god.

I almost want to work another business trip toward Mississauga just to stay in Oakville and while away a few more evenings at this great bar."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times now and it seem like every visit, something goes wrong, but I keep coming back because friends like it here. 

First visit was a few months after they opened, it was great, my friend wanted a beer and we share 3 desserts, they were perfect and I was really excited to come back. 

Some visits in between, nothing to complain about, food was good, drinks were good, people happy, I was happy to come back.

Then one visit earlier this year (early February), I made an order of flamm chips as a snack one evening, it took almost an hour to be served and when the server brought it to me, he spilled half of it onto the table. He offered to get me another order, that came within 15 minutes and were barely crispy and golden, the server did take it off the bill though. 

At a more recent visit for a friend's birthday (mid April), we arrived for 8:30pm on a weekday, I had already had dinner, so I was only interested in dessert while the rest of the party were looking at entrees. The server brought everyone's drink except mine. Yes, I asked for a water, but so did three other people and they got their water. She then started to take everyone's food order starting with the person to my left and went clockwise, as I'm still looking at the menu trying to decide, when I finally made a decision and looked up, she had taken everyone's order and left. It took a while to be able to flagged her down and I ordered the cheesecake.

When my cheesecake came, it was the most horrendous looking cheesecake I have ever been served in my life! The cheesecake looked melted, it flopped and looked sad, it was also missing most of the bottom crust and served with a pool of caramel sauce, it's as if they though putting a soup serving of caramel will justify putting half a cheesecake on a plate. I was just so upset with this, I didn't even know what to do with it, but what I did know was I wasn't going to eat it. After a few minutes looking at this sad excuse for a dessert, I sent it back with a server and she said she'll see about bringing me another one. They come back to tell me something about only having 2 halves of a cheesecake or something, at this point, I'm so close to just telling them to forget the whole thing, but other friends were still eating and I wanted to see what this cheesecake will be like. By the time most of my friend finish eating, I'm finally served a decent looking order of cheesecake minus it being 2 halves of a cheesecake put together. It was good, but probably the last time I order anything here. I'll come to hang out with friends and watch sports and I'll bring my own water."}
{"text":"Came here mainly for the beer since the food reviews I saw here weren't so hot. Place was packed on a Monday evening with a line waiting to get inside for a table. Really surprised me especially on a Monday.

Sat at the bar and ordering the sampler of 4 shots of different brews. Beers were good but nothing hit me over the head like the brews at Mill St. do. Bartenders were pretty slow and it took a long time to get my check so I could get out of there. I'm not sure I'll come back but I likely will just to see if the food quality improves."}
{"text":"Not as good as SteamWhistle Pilsner.  We had the flint of beers.  Enjoyed the white and amber the most.  The munich (specialty beer) was interesting, but David did not like it. Pumpkin was awful.  what is it with all restaurants doing pumpkin flavors in the fall??  I'm so over it!!"}
{"text":"Wishing I read the review from Mike S. before this visit.  Sausage so DRY I regret walking pass the Hotdog vendors from Union Station to get here.

Somebody here missed the lesson about how PORK FAT rules.  I'm not talking about using it as a filler but this is definitely not considered a Sausage.  You can call it \"Lean Dry Ground Up Sh1t & Sauerkraut\".  I'm just glad there is no reference of any kind of this item relating to anything German, or else there'll be a Riot.

Surprisingly I was OKAY with the Beer as I tasted a couple, which means that the Beer wasn't that great because I am a complete Beer NOVICE in training.  You can impress me with Beer, it's not a good thing.

Fries were the highlight as it was well-seasoned.  The COMPLIMENTARY Peanuts served a good purpose and I found the STASH one level upstairs on my Quest for the Mighty Throne.  

It was quite a journey of discovery that does make sense in a way as if you get a TOUR of the Brewery, so make sure you go take a PISS while you're here.  Great place for Washroom & Peanuts!"}
{"text":"Love how theyre opened until 2am because my boyfriend and I get off work extremely late and by the time we're done, most restuarants are already closed. I know nothing about beer but my boyfriend really enjoyed a 1litre cup for only $10. He says something about it is definitely different from the beer you usually get from lcbo. Food was delicious and worth the price. 

MUCH better than the regular bar restaurant chains like moxie, milestones etc~ 

Loved the patio environment and the waitress was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Beer was so-so.  Luckily offered vegetarian entrees although a vegetarian bean burger would be a welcome addition.  Environment is noisy and prevents meaningful conversation. Waitress was very attentive. Ordered the Provencale would rate it at 6/10."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service; was told a wait time of 20 to 40 min...when few tables were empty and when asked for the manager we were told he is very busy and cant attend. So we decided to leave and had a good time at Boston Pizza...
In short we have decided never ever we will be visiting this place......"}
{"text":"Thought we would love this place ? Beers (draught) were just above warm and our group tried several different types. The burgers were a 6 / 10. 
We were really looking forward to a micro brewery foodie experience."}
{"text":"Beer samplers and flammekeuches (aka pizzas!!) at 3 Brewers make for a great meal and a delicious way to quench your thirst. I've been here quite a few times and I'm always eager to try something new because their food is all good quality and made with fresh ingredients. 

I would definitely recommend getting a flammekeuches (the Manhattan is a personal favourite) or their steak and frites are very good as well (it comes with garlic fries!!). The  mussels are good here too, my only suggestion is to skip the salad here because they leave you craving for something more."}
{"text":"Food was fine. Beer is cheap and a fairly good. Ambiance is just ok. Service was ok."}
{"text":"The staff is very nice and it's a very convenient location, but the beer here is simply not good. I have been here a couple times and have tried something different every time, and there's lots of flavors, but they really don't come together very well. The Amber, for example is carboardy and bland, and just tastes like fizz and dust. I love beer, all kinds of beer, so it isn't an issue of it being too 'out there' or anything. All the brews I've tried taste like the early iterations of a brew that isn't quite there yet.

I'll probably be back again, lots of friends seem to like this place, but i'll probably just stick to water next time."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner, had a look at the menu beforehand and saw they updated it since our last visit. I was hopeful that the items were still the same quality and flavour it was before. Our waitress was very good and she kept organized with our tabs. We ordered the pulled pork burger with a poutine and a Manhattan flammekueche with a blonde beer. When our food arrived we quickly noticed that our side poutine was really sad. There was barely any fries, cheese or gravy to call it a poutine. We've ordered this before and it was a actually satisfying before. Now it couldn't barely satisfy one person. My old favourite flammekueche was the 'moulin rouge' which they no longer have. The new one I tried although definitely had better cuts of steak pieces on it, was bland and lacklustre. There was no sauce or zest to it, the new dough they use is denser and mimics pizza dough when the old dough was light and rich. Bf said his burger was dry and if there was no pulled pork on it...even drier. Blonde beer tasted good. Used to be one of my favourite restaurant just for their flammekueche. What a bummer."}
{"text":"The food is toooooo fried (!) like seriously  not possible to digest if you are over 16+ ... the beer  selection is nice especially the \"blonde\" one but this is pretty much it - can find similar flavours on other places ; 
The lights (!) are cold white ... not suitable for a restaurant where ppl want to feel more cozy then just an eatery ... room for improvement for sure ..."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is pretty cool--looks fun for dinner. It has a great pub vibe. We were there for lunch on a weekday and it was pretty empty. We chose this place since they have their own beer on tap. Unfortunately, the beer was nothing special (according to my husband; I did not partake). They have a fairly varied menu. I got a goat cheese sandwich, which was OK. It was really small, and the side salad was extremely sad-looking and bland. The focaccia bread was great though. Service was friendly and prompt--no complaints there."}
{"text":"i like this bar!

it's close to eaton center. they have beer cocktails. and barrels full of peanuts for grabs!

i like the open face seafood sandwich, the german sausages are good also. i like meeting friends here and have a beer. again, location is a HUGE factor as well. I've been here on weekend evenings when it's jam-packed and also on weekday afternoon just to sit by the open store front enjoy a beer and a some friendly conversation. 

i like it!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for a Markham/Richmond hill bar! If you're an avid bar hopper and enthusiast like myself, you know that there are barely any good bars and brew houses in the area but 3 Brewers has done it! 

Really big place that took over the melting pot! FINALLY RIGHT! That melting pot has been waiting to melt since 5ever ago. The restaurant is probably one of the biggest in the east beaver creek area, with a looooong bar and tables all around.. And a patio! The tall tables are a bit weird though, comfy but uncomfy at the same time- for such tall tables, you'd think they'd screw it down to the floor so people don't come tumbling down.. especially after they've had a few pints. 

This gastropub looks like a gem you'd find uptown. The service is really good and they are super helpful! The drinks are awesome! Unique and delicious beer cocktails, YUM.....
The menu is pretty big and unique- never seen a place in GTA with nocoise salad (\"your mother is so stupid, she goes to Barneys rooftop deck and orders a nocoise salad and calls it a nocoy salad\" -white chicks reference, anyone?) I got the pulled pork sandwich and OUUUU, deliciouso! Super tended and flavourful pork in a baguette... mmmm, 10/10 would get again. The portions are not really big for the price but meh, it's bar food price. 

Overall, I would come back again! Nice atmosphere and food. However, I'm not too fond of the area- People that look like they've never driven a day in their lives before taking over the parking lot. I hate going to bars in the same city I live in due to fear of running into people I know, but I guess I'll risk it for this cool place!"}
{"text":"I originally went to the 3 brewers on St. Denis in Montreal years ago and have been to a few of the GTA area. Went by here for a quick drink prior to catching a movie near by.
We opted for the bar since we already had dinner before hand. It was clean, spacious and a nice atmosphere. It's nice to be spaced out enough at the bar where you can't hear your neighbor's conversation and it still felt intimate. 

We had our favorite brews, IPA and Brown and ordered a hazelnut dip for dessert. Everything tasted good, and service was friendly. Only down side was we were never brought any water with our order. 

Over all a good experience for beer lovers the brewing room is a nice visit. We will drop by again if we are near by!"}
{"text":"I went on the weekend with some friends. The service was ok but the food wasn't worth it. I got the lille fluk thing and steak frittes to share. The lille pizza thing wasn't good, just way to much mushrooms and not enough cheese.  There isn't any sauce, so it pretty much tasted like a cracker with a bunch of mediocre toppings. The steak was ok could have used  more flavour. The only thing that was good was the garlic fries that came with the steak. Overall it just wasn't worth it. I wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"Overall, this is a nice spot on Yonge Street in Toronto.  They are open fairly late when compared to other restaurants and the kitchen seems to be open until roughly 1am on weekends, so this is a good spot for late night drinkers, partyers, or grub seekers.  Please do not be upset if I am mistaken, but from what I could tell, the only beer they serve is their own beer.  They have a few consistently available beers from light-to-dark and some small-batch craft beers. They also serve cocktails and wine. The beer was good. I had the amber. It's a nice flavor to ABV ratio for me. I am not into stouts and lighter beers sometimes so not hit my desired ABV level ;). They are available in several sizes, with value added as volume increases, of course. The food is good. Prices are OK.  Service not so great, but Acceptable. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I suppose it's admirable that a  chain restaurant is channeling craft beer goodness and using it to lure hordes of relatively clueless tourists, white-shirts, and friends who should know better but come along anyway (re: me).

Unfortunately, the beer here is underwhelming: it's rather hit and miss, usually not very representative of the style implied by the names, and occasionally downright bad.  I did once have a trappist style that was actually pretty darn tasty, but other than that I'm just not impressed.  Their current special offering, La Belle Provence, is supposed to be a maple syrup dark ale... but, at $11.45 a bottle, it ends up being an overpriced, cloyingly sweet, hyper-carbonated beer-pop with a mouth-kick of pure alcohol I wouldn't expect from a mere 7% ABV.  This stuff drinks like a poorly balanced 10+% brew, and I'm left wondering how in the world it ever won a medal of excellence anywhere despite their claims of a Silver Something Or Other.

Anyway, enough with the beer... others have noted that the food here is subpar, but I'll disagree.  It's just very inconsistent.  The poutine is wretched, however, with store bought fries, canned gravy, and a handful cheese curd that comes out in a ball more often than not -- seriously, avoid it like the plague.  Don't say you weren't warned!

So, what's good?  I recommend their sausage and sauerkraut.  It's not up to the standards of Wvrst, but it's tasty and really hits the spot.  Not dry at all, as others have mentioned, but juicy, delicious, and a huge amount of food for the $14.95 they charge.  I'll order it again when next I find myself at 3Bs, as I inevitably will despite my better judgement.

Finally, service is typically attentive but flavourless -- people just kinda doing their job well with a minimum of personality injected into the experience.  No worries.  We bring plenty of personality to the table, we don't need our server to trump us!"}
{"text":"Good food and ambience. We loved the patio, that is where we prefer to sit when dining here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nice casual place to enjoy a drink/snack that isn't a traditional bar or sports bar then you should definitely come to 3 Brewers! Unfortunately their food was a tad underwhelming and simply wasn't worth it for the price.

I'm by no means a beer drinker but enjoyed their traditional et cetera tasting board. There was the blonde, amber, white, and brown and it was really interesting trying all of them. Our favourite was definitely the white as it was light, refreshing, and citrusy. The darker beers were more rich and provided a nice contrast.

For the food we got the half rack of ribs and the chicken and waffles. I was probably expecting too much but the food was just simply overwhelmingly average. The overall quality was underwhelming and the food lacked preparation and finesse. The waffles still had the crusts of coagulated sugar and there was simply no sauce to bring and bind the chicken waffle sandwich together. The coleslaw was a bit dry and didn't have sufficient mayo coating the cabbage. That being said the ribs were pretty decent and was definitely fall off the bone. The bbq sauce was a good amount of tang and sweetness but could have used just a tad more on them.

The service was in fact really good here and our waitress took care of us incredibly well. I also liked the atmosphere here at 3 brewers. It was very cozy and casual and there was certain warmth to the interior with the bricks which made the place very rustic."}
{"text":"I honestly love the vibe here. It's never too busy here so they dont rush you. I can sit, relax, and chill as much as I want. I love their fruity beers especially their rasberry lemonade which I got for $5.00. Its suppose to be a slushie but I got it over ice instead which I like more. I also got their arugula, sundried tomato and goat cheese flammekuche. Flammekuche is a really thin flat bread so its not too heavy. The ingredients were fresh and portions arent small at all. The flammekuche is $14 and they change the flavours from time to time. Staff is friendly and food is fresh. Love it here!"}
{"text":"Only had food: 

Came here as a group. A friend and I ended up sharing a flat bread and fish and chips. The flat bread was extremely mediocore since it was cold by the time it was brought to us. The fish was over battered and over cooked while absorbing a tad too much oil (and it also came out in similar temperature to the flat bread) 

Service: 

Despite having plenty of staff on that night, it was slow and they seemed to be a bit disorganized 

My friend had a beer and said it was yummy though. So if anything .... Just stick to beverages?"}
{"text":"I quite liked this place.  The food, we had the Provencale Flammekueche (some sort of pizza'ish thingy) and it was delicious.  We didn't really try anything else on their menu, another time perhaps.

Their menu selections were interesting and their pricing was on par with pretty much every other place in that area (Yonge/Dundas).  

We loved the beers.  We ordered the \"metre of beer\" which is basically a selection of 10 1/2 pints of their various beer offerings.  I personally loved the Brown beer which was a blend of caramel, chocolate and coffee...Mmmm.  I also tried their pumpkin beer which had a bit of a sweet taste with a spicy kick...loved it as well.

I enjoyed the overall ambiance of this place.  Everyone there seemed to be having a good time.  

My only complaint is that you have to walk, for what seems like days, to get to the bathrooms.  Two flights of stairs and all the way to the back of the room, past the glassed in, on-site brewing operation.  I guess that's one way to get you to see where they brew their beer.

I quite enjoyed my time there and will definitely go again and try more of their food offerings...though with a name like 3 Brewers, I suspect the beer is probably the main event."}
{"text":"Really good food and drinks! Our waiter was nice and polite. He told us about how crazy busy they get during raptors games so we gotta be there an hour early to get good seats. Ok that works see u then lol"}
{"text":"I would say this place is 2.5 stars. 

This is your average chain restaurant/pub. The service was really slow despite there are being a total of 10 people in the restaurant. Fries were frozen (luckily I asked, bc I hate that). 

We were there with with friends and a lot of items were ordered: 

Fish and chips - looked crisp and was served fresh from the fryer. See fries comment above  

We had the pretzels and they were very good. The mustard on the side was also really delicious. A great price at $5 for two. 

My husband and I both had burgers. They were surprisingly good. Flat top, good crust, bun was perfect - not to soft but also not crunchy.  It was dense and chewy. 

Caesar salad was good. Way better choice over the fries. 

My friend ordered the Mac and cheese grilled cheese. I took a bit and the flavour was good but I didn't think there was good ratio of filler to bread (filler was really thin!).   My other friend ordered a sandwich with chicken and pick de gallo. She wasn't enthused. Nothing special. 

I would go back. It is better than most (Kelsey's, Boston pizza, east sides marios, etc). But at the end of the day, it's just blah chain food."}
{"text":"Had an hour to kill before a movie starts at Dundas Square, Les 3 Brasseurs was a natural choice. The host was very nice and service was good. Beer was quite tasty so overall a good place for chilled freshly brewed beer."}
{"text":"Ratings:
Food: 9/10

Service: 9/10
Value: 8/10
Hygiene: 10/10
Aesthetics: 9/10

This 3 brewers is one of my regular spots to go to, it's close to work, close to home. It is a huge location and in the entertainment complex, so it's a good choice to go have a pint or a bite.

This place has been around for quite sometime and has been adjusting their menu constantly. The food does not disappoint and the options are always interesting. The kitchen is relatively flexible and willing to adjust the menu for certain requests. 

After my latest visit, I have to say, I have a new favorite dish here, it's the chicken and waffles... with the deep fried avocados. They did a really good job with it and even if the Belgian Waffles are a little sweeter than what I'm used to, it combined very well with the fried chicken. 

Every so often they'll change their seasonal beer and I feel obligated to try it out ;) I haven't been disappointed by any of their options. I'm not usually a fan of stouts, but the vanilla stout here is very good. If you come here with a group of people, and everyone wants the same beer, the pitchers are a good deal, However, if you come here and everyone wants a different beer, they don't punish you for it like most places and make you pay for individual glasses. You have the option here to buy the metre of beer, and they even throw in a flamme too.  

The prices are reasonable and it's a good place to grab a bite or a pint before or after going to one of the nearby activities. 

The decor is nice and spacious, the ceilings are high and the chairs are comfortable. 

I definitely recommend this place and will continue to be a regular patron at this establishment."}
{"text":"This is the last time I am in this place and I have to say don't come here. The service is awful. We had to chase down our server for everything. Ketchup, drink, etc. 

We ordered butternut quash salad, tandoori pizza, and onion soup. The onion soup was ok. The pizza was tasteless, really bad. The salad dressing was tasteless and we had to send it back to the kitchen to get it right. Some ingredients were missing the first time. 

The server didn't ask to bring any plate or water. 

If you want to come here, stick to beer and some appetizers. That is all. You are waisting your money otherwise. 

I am sorry for the money I waisted."}
{"text":"A good time to spend your Friday night. The wait time was bearable, and the service was pretty good, which was not expected given how busy it was. We ordered a couple of beers & tried out the butter chicken pizza for the first time. The butter chicken pizza was gone in less than a minute!! it was a good portion size, light( flatbread) and I'd definitely go back"}
{"text":"Very loud with a large crowd to match.

Came here seeking suds and we found it - we also found some poutine and other hearty fare to coat the stomach with.

I liked the flight of beers that you could get - so much that I have a hard time remember which ones I enjoyed the most. The brown ale sticks out as the best but the others just seemed like regular beer after a while.

Staff needs to be more attentive - after we got our beer, she pretty much disappeared for an hour. My friend had fun hitting the frowny face on the feedback machine for five minutes while we paid the bill."}
{"text":"We had a coupon for a complementary pizza -thingy and decided to give it a try.  We tried the southern version and it was quite good, with a poutine and my son had the burger. Standard fare, the unique spin being the beer brewed I. Site. We sampled the blonde and Amber, with a half pint of IPA. Very good beer.

I would avoid the 'Beer-ita' drink- which appeared to look good, but in execution was a bit watery.

The service is quite good and attentive, with a fun atmosphere highlighted by the music and sport in the televisions. 

It is tough to make a go of businesses in that area, so we certainly hope they do well."}
{"text":"A nice blend of good food and good brew.  It was a rainy day in Richmond Hill when I stopped in for lunch.  The place was fairly empty, but the staff was attentive.  I had heard about these things called \"flamms\", an impossibly thin-crust pizza that's really not a pizza, for either a shareable appy or a main.  There are only a few varieties, but none were like a typical Italian pizza.

I had the Venetian, which is as Italian as they get for a French based chain.  It had tissue thin shaved, dry aged artisanal meats, tomatoes, roasted peppers, Kalamata olives, mozza and swiss cheeses, and drizzled with olive oil.  The \"crust\" was about half the thickness of a fresh tortilla, so I knew a whole flamm as a main dish would not be overkill.  It was surprisingly good, and punted its nearest competitor (thin crust pizza) to the curb.

The knowledgable server explained a bit about the chain's origin in France, and the derivation of the name.  Flammekueches were originally a dough that they would throw into the oven to check the temperature.  Since they were pulling these flatbreads out cooked, why not toss some toppings on and eat it instead of tossing it.  Must be a French innovation.

Anyway, my associate had the fish and chips.  The fish was as good as any, and the beer batter coating was especially good.  I didn't really have room for the Liege Waffle with vanilla ice cream and Brown Beer caramel sauce, but I asked if I could taste a teaspoon of the sauce. It was incredible!

And beer?  Yes, fresh brew is yours, with pairings for the menu items.  As if beer needed to be paired with anything other than my mug!

You need to try this place.  I need to go back for desert."}
{"text":"We visited this location for the first time on the Tuesday after Labour Day, so as expected, the place was nearly empty.

Our server was pleasant, but not overly attentive. I mean, we're in an empty beer hall and a fat man with an empty beer glass has to flag down the server to ask for a refill. This is what you are here for!

It was worse because she came and asked if she could clear our soup dishes and neglected to ask if I wanted another beer. Then, she walked away before I could actually make the move and ask.

French onion soup was rather bland.

My wife had a burger, which was excellent. I had a sort of beef stew dish that was also excellent.

Once we finished, our plates were removed and we waited what seemed like a very long time for our bill."}
{"text":"Went there with the family for dinner. Ordered several dishes including the 3brewers burger, the chicken & lentils salad, the sundried tomato pizza and the braised beef sandwich. Overall the food was very mediocre and i didn't really like any of the things we ordered. The home brewed beers were good. We tried the samplers. The service was good. So I would recommend this place if you're not going specifically for food. 

Food: 2/5
Service and atmosphere: 4/5
Price: 3/5
Overall: 3/5"}
{"text":"Went there with a couple friends mainly for drinks. They have their own micro brewery so i tried their Amber and Blonde. The beer was decent...i liked the blonde. We also tried the nachos which was good size and gourmet. The staff and service was very nice and we were greeted with a smile by everyone. Would go there again."}
{"text":"Meh. The beer was good but the food was marginal.  I had a salad and it was so overloaded with dressing that I almost sent it back. 

The guy next to me had a a burger and it didn't look like anything special.  

The service is good but the vibe of the place is a little strange.  Kind of like a big open room."}
{"text":"Not sure why the avg rating is low. The food is not bad at all, the beer collection is humble and the setting is really good. Come on guys set your prorities straight, is it the beer, food or you just being silly. The place was packed when we visited but the reception manager provided a much quieter spot for a nice family gathering and the server's were very friendly to our 5 year old. Kids meal pizza along with flat bread and Fettuccini was nice.  I will surely visit again."}
{"text":"I am surprised at some of these reviews as well.

Just returned to the states from my first visit to the lovely city of Toronto, and this was the only brewpub I was able to visit. While I had hoped to visit a more \"beery\" place, I was with my wife and mother-in-law so this place seemed to be a good compromise for the three of us. Visited on a crowded Friday Night.

My wife ordered the Thai salad, my mother in law opted for the chicken and ribs, and I went for the braised pork shank, replete with baked potato and sauerkraut. We all gave the food high marks. Not the best we've ever had, but damn good. Not a complain amongst us. 

My wife and I ordered the beer sampler, and both agreed that all styles were up to snuff. After deciding that I favored the amber, I ordered a full litter mug - which for being in a big city in the heart of downtown was a great deal at $9.50. (or close to it) With a full litter mug of excellent beer and the meal I had to drink it with, I was in heaven. The three of us agreed we had made the right choice, and got a great value for our tourist dollar. I will go back here the next time I'm able to travel to Toronto.

When I think back to my three days in Toronto, that litter mug of Three Brasseurs Amber and the Hockey Hall of Fame are what I'll remember most."}
{"text":"I couldn't find this place on yelp because it's really the three Brewers. Nous ne sommes pas au Québec !

That said, all their plates did have the name en français. We enjoyed drinks and some snacks. Service and atmosphere were pleasant."}
{"text":"The beer is good, the food is not bad but the service needs a real improvement!!!! 

It's busy and super noisy, if you can't keep the pace... maybe look to work elsewhere! 

Our waitress took so long to take our order, then wait near to 45mn to take our dessert order (for which she forgot the cutlery), she took some empty plates but left other on the table until the end, or she just disappeared for so long we thought she had finished her shift!! 

She was very quick to bring the bill tho... too bad for her the tip reflects the service."}
{"text":"Just drove in from ottawa for a family (sad) event.  Sat at the bar with my wife on a very busy Friday night.  Beer was great and so was the service. Did not have food, but I was watching and it all looked great. Randy was a great bartender."}
{"text":"Went here for the second time with my son and husband tonight and have to say I was so disappointed in our experience. My first visit here was good, I enjoyed the food and the service was decent. Tonight was the complete opposite. I ordered a chicken dish that ended up being so spicy I couldn't even eat it (it had no pepper symbol on it which would indicate spice), my drink was awful, and our service was no better. When I told our server about the dish being too spicy he just said \"yeah they must have added too much spice\" - no apology, not even an offer to see a menu so I could order something else, just took the plate away with all the food still on it. He didn't check in throughout the meal at all (he actually came and took ketchup from our table and still didn't ask if we needed anything), my husbands drink sat empty from the time our food got to our table until we left, I didn't touch my drink at all and he didn't even think to ask if it was ok, he didn't offer a dessert menu when we were finished, I sat there with my debit card on the table for close to 20 minutes while he walked past several times without bringing the bill. I don't feel like a servers job is to stand there and talk to their coworkers until their tables flag them down to ask for everything - they should be attentive and able to resolve any issues. The only reason I've given 2 stars is because my husband enjoyed his food and drink."}
{"text":"Solid selection of craft beers, brewed on-site. The food is mostly decent. Go for the burgers and sandwiches. The steaks are also decent, but the quality isn't quite as nice as at an actual steakhouse. Good place to watch a game."}
{"text":"Solid food and service!

I have been here before a few times, but came here for dinner with friends that have not been to 3 Brasseurs before. The place is pretty busy since it has a pretty big patio and it is pretty good spot for anyone who are into FIFA. There is a great selection of beer and I have to mention there is a seasonal summer raspberry beer. I opted for the red sangria as it was recommended by my knowledgeable server. 
The menu at 3 Brasseurs is the same so far since I last visited quite a while ago. From the looks of what other people ordered, the dishes still looked pretty good- especially for those meat-lovers, their braised pork shank is very satisfying and filling; definitely meant for sharing. I also recommend their beef bourguignon- another satisfying dish. I recently tried their flat bread- the one called \"Manhattan\"- it's with steak, mushrooms and cheese. The main reason I ordered it was cause of the mushrooms and it was recommended by the server- there were definitely a lot of mushrooms but the steak slices were a bit dry. The flat bread was still tasty though. 
We also shared a few appetizers between the 4 of us- popcorn shrimp and beer battered onion rings (served with honey). These choices were good, great for sharing and definitely solid.

A place I would come again and maybe try something new or go back to the pasta or pork shank lol."}
{"text":"The 3 brewer's pub is a chain of micro brewery restaurant that serves their own beer. Good place for a guys night out for beers but if you go in looking for a Canadian or a Bud you'll be disappointed. They do have some tasty options as well as seasonal brews that are quite tasty and the prices are pretty good.

The food is standard food you could get at any pub and is reasonably priced. I personally like the spicy burger or the pork shank.

Be warned that when it does get busy, it takes a while to get some service to even get your drink order. But the staff are usually nice and good to chat with."}
{"text":"As of recently 3 brewers have been opening a few locations in the GTA.  Thankfully there is one close to home.  My buddy and I decided to check the NEW-ish location, however unsure how long its been opened for but definitely happy to see a reputable franchise-bar among the other businesses in the area. 
Coming here on a Friday night we were able to grab a small booth, and without any delays our server arrived.  
The atmosphere is definitely alive here on weekends, especially if there are any games being broadcasted on the big screen.  The main bar is the focal point of the restaurant that's serving drinks non-stop. 
My buddy and I ordered a pitcher of their Blonde beer, smooth, light and not too bitter...  Something I'd order the next time I come here....
For Grub we ordered their plate of nachos! reasonably priced, the portions were more than enough, and after all....how can you screw up nachos. 

Overall the location, price, service, and great range of beers (also wine for those wanting to be different) is perfect for those wanting to go to a nice bar in the Hwy 7 and 404 area...."}
{"text":"Came here again last afternoon with a party of 3 on a Sunday. There were a handful of other tables there, so the place wasn't as empty as I had thought/expected a late afternoon to be. Anyhow, we ordered the steak and mushroom flammekueche, the cassoulet, and the beer-braised pork shank.

The last time we came, we also ordered the pork shank, which was and still is delicious. Yes, the prices do seem higher than other typical places, but their portion sizes are enormous. You can almost certainly split the pork shank between two people. Their cassoulet comes with garlic bread for dipping and a small side salad which is definitely very refreshing since the stew itself is a little thick. The flammekueche is essentially a thin pizza. It was done well, but then again, I don't know difficult it would be to mess up a thin crusted pizza though. There were lots of mushrooms and caramelized onions on it, so it was fairly filling too.

Prices are reasonable considering the food quality and large portion sizes. I can't say that their service is great or awful, it was rather typical and expected. I'd be back here for some of their foods and probably out of convenience too since it is super close to the Downtown core/Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for a quick beer and app before going to a show at Yonge-Dundas Square. The bartender (female) was superb. She offered us a few samples of beer before we decided and gave a great recommendation on the Poutine flatbread. She even charged my phone with her cord behind the bar. The Munich 1L was very good as was the flatbread. Great service and good food.  Give her a bonus. Above and beyond."}
{"text":"The beer selection is amazing!! Love the fact they have seasonal flavours. Cool vibe and nice set up"}
{"text":"Has to be the worst dinner we've ever had. All four items were terrible. Spinach dip, cheddar beer soup, goat cheese salad, chicken avocado sandwich. Cold food, old food. First and last time there."}
{"text":"Just went there for dinner with a group of coworkers who are all traveling together. 3 of us wanted to order the special cassoulet. We were there right around 8PM so they shouldn't be out of stuff that early but apparently they were slammed so they said they only had 1 of the cassoulet left. So 2 of us got other items. A little while later the food came out and the guy who got the cassoulet noticed something: the duck leg was missing. That was the centerpiece of the dish! We then asked what is going on, they pretended they didn't know and went back to the kitchen. Manager came out and said sorry they ran out of duck but they gave us an extra slice of pork belly. They couldn't tell us up front? Then we saw that all of our burgers have sandwich buns and the managers were like oh yeah, we were out of burger buns too. He then took down our drink order then disappeared and we ate our food without the server or the manager coming back to check on us or bring back any drinks. When the check came, they took off 10 dollars for the cassoulet. I guess in the future if you ordered a burger at McDonald's and they ran out of beef patty's they'll do you a favor and not tell you and charge you half just for the buns and lettuce. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE the star rating overall speaks for itself"}
{"text":"Great to have them expand into Richmond Hill. However, service was not attentive and the waitress can never be found when you need to order. Come if you don't care about service, but only to try out their different beers! Great place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Their beer-braised pork shank is great, but be prepared for a huge portion!"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick drink before dinner.  I felt like I walked into a saloon.  Everyone was wearing plaid except for me.  We sat at the bar and ordered a few drinks - I tried one of their sangrias which tasted fine.  My friend ordered a sangria as well (a different flavoured one than me) and it was a blue/green in colour.  Perhaps just stick with the classics.

Service was a bit slow seeing as we were seating at the bar.  The place was busy but I didn't see many servers around, there were however 2-3 hostesses in the front...doing what I am not sure.

We didn't try the food, but reading some of the reviews glad we saved our money in this area."}
{"text":"OK so we went into this place cause it looked kinda cool. Well not so much. 

First of all because of the brewery this place smells like hops and stale peanuts. I'm NOT down. So we get sat by the hostess upstairs and there was one other table that got sat there as well. The server took 15 minutes to come to use. By that point the other table had left. Worst service ever. We ordered our food (whole another story there) And by the time our food came I still had not received my WATER?!?!? like are you pumping the spring in the back. I asked her 2 times for the water. Ridiculous. The food was so so, My boyfriend got some pizza that was garbage and I cant remember what i got because it isn't worth remembering. The smell alone was something i couldn't get used to, like a fart or the way your apartment building smells lol. We only stayed because we only had 1 hour for lunch and by that point there was no point in going somewhere else. I will NEVER go there again. Shit service and stale peanuts are not my forte. :)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go and have a few drinks with some freinds or a date ...I tried the wings they were decent . But again grab your freinds go for beers that's what this place if for . Drink up ."}
{"text":"The bar staff was great and quickly greeted us. The beers we ordered were good. Definitely will be stopped by again!"}
{"text":"Ate there last night before a concert. Very nice place but not great food. I had the salmon flamkeutche and you could barely see the salmon or any other ingredients. Never again."}
{"text":"If you are a not a beer drinker, don't worry because they don't serve any here.  Instead they have a variety of sewer water ranging from honey flavour, to sour milk.  I ordered a blonde, but got a wit.  Not feeling that picky I just went with it and it went down like drinking sweet and sour sauce from Mandarin.  Not willing to give up I had a dark which actually hurt me a little.  I didn't know a taste could be so terrible as to hurt.  This is only after being lucky enough to actually get served.  Its like a lottery, only when you win they poison you."}
{"text":"Went on valentine's day which was also NBA All-Star game and we were able to get a seat at the bar no problem (we thought it would be packed with line up). My first time experience was great! Layout and decor was great. Ordered a blonde and IPA beers, chicken quesadilla, blue brie burger w/ fries, and blondie for dessert. Beers are brewed on site and tasted great - good depth of flavour. Chicken quesadillas lacked some veggies (only had chicken and onions), but flavour was also great. Blue brie burger was juicy and had balsamic glaze which added another layer of flavour (I would order it again!). Blondie had good texture but wished it was warmed up a bit. It was very hard to break into. I would definitely return here and add on my list of regular places to eat!"}
{"text":"Les 3 Brasseurs is pretty much on-par with the chains in the area. I would normally have given then a three, because the food is decent, but for a place advertised as a beer venue, the beer is actually quite mediocre. Frustratingly, the bar can take quite a while even though they don't take moderately-complex drink orders (e.g. I was unable to get a whiskey sour one evening). 

The staff is nice, and they can accomodate large groups, so that is definitely a plus."}
{"text":"For a spot in tourist central, this was not terribly priced and surprisingly not completely overrun either.  I'm not a beer drinker but I'm told by aficionados I know that their selection is quite good.

Have the french dip sandwich and a ceasar and you won't care if you're not a beer drinker either.  I could have eaten two and drank the juices off the plate.  I may have tried.  I'm not a pretty dinner date.

Cheesecake was also delicious.

Will probably stop in again; there were a number of apps that sounded de-lish that I didn't get a chance to try."}
{"text":"Came here for a light dinner after movies. I actually ordered a light dinner while dining out!

I ordered the Santa Fe salad paired with the Blonde Ale. It was very refreshing beer and I felt no harsh aftertaste. The salad itself was great! It was large enough to be a meal and filling. It includes chicken and this made it more appealing to me.  I don't like salad dressing so although I ordered it on the side, I didn't pour it over my salad. My dinner companion ordered one of the flatbreads. I believe he ordered the Venetian paired with the IPA. It is a large dish! No complaints from him!

Efficient and professional service. Apparently, you can book tours of the brewery. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"I usually don't do this but I gave an extra star in the rating because the place is new and they are still working out their kinks but if all goes well they would shape up to be a solid 4 star maybe possibly a 5 star place. I've been to one in Montreal and it was great, let us hope The 3 Brewers live up to their potential.

Situated in the most busiest part of Toronto and amidst all the hustle and bustle of tourist traps and following tourists, The 3 Brewers is a refreshing and welcomed addition to the otherwise dry surroundings.

From the outside The 3 brewers doesn't look like much but once you step inside you are welcomed with a glass enclosed brew kettles, copper top polished bar, semi opened kitchen, booths and banquettes with dark would trim, excellent tile work, and flat screen televisions. The space inside is absolutely huge. There is a private looking area upstairs that is sectioned off with quarter height wood dividers. A second bar is located upstairs along with a second brew kettle and open barely storage. There is a 3 floor loft that would be great for a large party. 

Upstairs is definitely the place to be but downstairs is still very nice. There's just a type of seclusion that happens upstairs that takes you away from the busy storefront filled with tourists that downstairs offers but I dare you to instinctively find the bathroom from entering the brewery. Ignore the signs and resist asking people, the location of the bathrooms will surprise you. Speaking of bathrooms, they are spectacular here. Not just because they are new but because of the tile, trim, and faucets chosen. There are even separate commodes with floor to ceiling privacy doors.

The beer here is what should be the star of the show. It does the job, good tasting beer in blonde, red, wheat, and dark flavors. Food here is a little better than your typical pub food. Try the flamm(pizza) as it has super thin crust and covered in cheese. It is a little thicker than a crepe if that helps put the thinness into perspective. The fries and poutine are also pretty good with excellent crisp and actual cheese curds.

Service here was hit and miss. A few servers didn't know the menu items/names and was unable to recommend a menu item. I'll give them slack as a lot of the servers had their first day the day I went in and they've only been opened a month. 

Overall, a great place for beers and food. Beer and flamm deal is great value. Prices for drinks are reasonable as were the prices for food. If you are ever stuck at the Eaton Centre just cross the street and head into this place. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"In from the states on a Canadian road trip. Found this place by searching breweries, and loved it! Beer was good--had the amber and the brown--and food was good. Best part was the service and friendliness. Thank you, Matt, for being a very good and cool server."}
{"text":"Take note that this review is strictly on their beers and does not reflect their food.

It was a little strange to walk into a space that somewhat resembles a brew house, pub that collided with Boston Pizza. I can't quite make out which direction I am really being pulled. While the seating is comfy and there are many TVs, the space is brighter than a cosmetic store; not exactly somewhere cozy and lounge like where you can chit-chat for hours. It doesn't have the party atmosphere of a bustling bar but yet isn't quite like an everyday lounge like Moxies.

Anyhow, on with the beer. I was drawn in by their many awards and accolades for their home brew beers. I was expecting a plethora of interesting, worldy and maybe even ground breaking beers but what I was rewarded with was your typical stuff. Wheat, amber, dark red ale and of course a lager; not exactly exciting stuff. I went with their amber cuz I was feeling it that night. It was surprisingly light; light in flavours, light in body and light in mouthfeel. There were watered-down hints of an amber in there somewhere but yeah that's about it. I reckoned maybe I made a bad choice so for the refill I went with their super duper award collector wheat beer. After several sips I came to the conclusion that it was as if you took Coors Light and put the tiniest sliver of lemon peel in it - just enough for a whiff of that citirus-y flavour but not quite substantial enough to hold it's flavours beyond that one single whiff. Sorry folks, Coors Light is not beer, it's just fizzy water - might as well order a club soda.

There you have it! Confusing environment, novice beers but amazing TVs to catch the game. Might as well grab a case of Coors Light and stay home for the night."}
{"text":"My first visit and first impression is good ambiance, good music, beautiful patio at night, friendly bartenders and waitresses.  Most importantly, good drinks, amazing food and especially good desserts.

Everything at this new location is beyond my expectation.  I will come back for sure."}

{"text":"Wanted to have some comfort food and have a beer.  
I had been to a 3 Brewers in Ottawa and thought this would work. 

Wow... talk about disappointing.  

Walked in, super noisy, and very busy, I see the host and tell her that it's just me. She says, I can sit at the bar and then barely lifts a finger to point in the general direction of the bar.  She hands me the menu and the drink list and I go find a seat.  

I get to the bar and was able to order quickly.  

I ordered a beer and I thought their beers were much better tasting.  Their version of a stout was really a very watery stout.  I noticed that the bartender was very busy, not only running to serve all the patrons sitting at the bar, but also quite a few tables near by.  I wait for quite a while to get my food, and when it finally comes my fries are luke warm, and the beef dip was very uninspiring.  Beef was dry and I was provided what I'm sure is the smallest sized plastic cup for the Au Jus.  Due to the bartender being busy she didn't come back to ask me if my meal was ok, and had to flag her down to get the pepper, which was behind the bar. 

Once I was finished it took a while to get my bill.  Noticed others waiting as well.

Overall, I have to say that this was sup-par, service, and food.  I had been to another 3 Brewers with much better experiences.  I'm not coming back to this one."}
{"text":"A group of us came here this evening for an after-movie meal. Luckily for us, apart from some minor rowdiness coming from a table of beer-infused revelers, the background noise was not so loud and I don't remember us having to raise our voices so we could hear each other. 
Our enjoyable dining experience was certainly made possible by our upbeat and accommodating Server.
A few of use wanted to try the Flammekueches and they all came out looking yummy. I had the Lilloise which has caramelized onions, smoked bacon and sauteed mushroom topped with Swiss and Mozarella cheese. The large enough \"flatbread\" was thin, crisp and also light in texture. The combination of the toppings blended well and my stomach didn't feel heavy after finishing it. The meals of the other diners also looked great especially this heaping bowl of Mussels Provencale served in a white wine and tomato sauce. The fun part of it was that it came covered with another bowl that acted like a dome to keep in the steam; pretty exciting how they were brought to the table.
I also tried a piece of my neighbour's Beer-Battered Maxi fries which was chewy soft inside with a thin batter-coating texture on the outside.
I still had room left for dessert so when our lovely server asked I immediately asked for the Liege Waffle as I was also craving for ice-cream. And I think about five others also went for that. Who can really resist the temptation of a waffle with ice-cream and a Brown beer caramel sauce? I guess not all of us who were there tonight :-) And everyone loved their waffles and the sauce added just enough sweetness to the waffle and ice-cream combination. Simply a sweet way to end a satisfying meal.
Overall, the experience at the 3 Brewers was ace and definitely made great by one Pro of a Server."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick snack and drink. 3.5/5 stars

SANGRIA (4/5)
(Blonde Ale, lime, orange and grapefruit juices)
Pretty good :) I was a little iffy at first about Sangria with beer.. but this was pretty good. A sweet and carbonated drink.

NACHOS (3/5)
(Crispy corn tortilla chips layered with melted cheese, jalapeño peppers, black 
olives, diced tomatoes and green onions. Served with sour cream and salsa)
Nachos are always a good idea with beer haha.. This was yummy.. Especially the guac!! Nom nom.."}
{"text":"they kinda have beer, reminiscent of cooper's malt extract kit beer, they all kinda tastd the same. service was acceptable just stick to mixed drinks."}
{"text":"The beer selection was great, but the food was, well, average. The friend I was with tried a number of beer samples before settling on one drink, where as I ordered a radler, which was very light and enjoyable. The beer-battered fries were also delicious, but their regular fries were, meh. It makes me wish that the meals came with a side of their beer-battered fries instead of just their regular fries. I ordered the mussels, which I felt were okay, but not spectacular. For dessert I shared a pretzel and a waffle. The pretzel was pretty good, but the waffle was too sweet for my liking. I'd return here for the atmosphere and beer selection. The waiter we had was also very nice. I won't be rushing back, but I would recommend it for a guys night out."}
{"text":"The 3 Brewers is a great spot to watch the game and chill after work.  A frequent \"go-to\" choice. My first time getting dessert here and it was delicious!

Tip: There is normally a line up, so try to be there early. Around 9pm."}
{"text":"People are straight up being way too hard on this place.  I am very experienced with the Montreal locations, especially the one at Crescent & St-Catherines, but I also have been to this one at Yonge & Dundas a couple times now.

They've got some tasty beers, including a white which is incredibly refreshing in the summertime.

They know how to use those beers to mix with other alcohols to please the non-beer drinkers such as my girlfriend.

And their food, while nothing special, is better than your average Turtle Jack's or Firkin Pub, so what's with all the shit reviews?  

Too trendy to hate a place for the wrong reasons -- and unfortunately, I don't put much stock into almost any of these reviewers below me because most of them fail to even describe the brews or what their problems were, other than complaining about a deep fried appetizer like they're expecting something spectacular..

Do yourself a favor and be your own judge, don't listen to these other yahoo's for the wrong reasons.  Prices on the beer aint bad either, and they've got the awesome 1 Litre dimpled stein glasses"}
{"text":"Very biased review, I most likely have blinders on because I've had so many great nights at Les Trois Brasseur in Montreal at Crescent & St-Catherines.

Still, to this day, I love the flammekueche flatbread pizzas and their white beer.  The beer at this location doesn't quite taste the same as in Montreal, I find it to have more carbonation and other minor different qualities, but I attribute it to the quality of the tap water in Peel (atrocious)

Still.  I think I'm gonna head here now for a pint.  

Took a star because there's no free roasted peanuts like in Montreal"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and have generally been pretty happy.  

I went just the other day when they had the patio open right on Yonge Street.  That was a treat!  I got a Flammekueche as I have on other occasions.  I love that it's pizza, but not pizza.  It's much lighter without the tomato sauce, and just as tasty.  I got the Manhattan with steak, mushrooms, cheese and onion.  It was delicious as usual.  I brought a colleague with me who had never been there and he tried the Italian Flammekueche.  He was quite impressed as well!  

I've also had the lamb sandwich.  I'm not a swiss cheese fan so asked for cheddar cheese instead.  Next time I think I'd just get it without cheese.  The cheddar cheese they used tasted like a processed cheese slice, so it kind of ruined a great sandwich.  The portion size was quite big.  I had some sandwich and salad left over for a snack.  

Note:  This place is huge so great it you're having a large group.  It has an upstairs too, for a bit more privacy."}
{"text":"5 Good and fresh beer selections appropriately paired with a tight and focused Canadian fare. This was my 4th visit (lunch always) and have never been disappointed. A safe bet for any client lunch."}
{"text":"I've been to the Winston Park location about 5 times during different hours. The only thing they are consistent with is how slow they are with taking your order and bringing your food. It take on average about 40 mins to actually get your food. No idea why and it's purely burgers and fries that our table orders whether with coworkers, friends or family."}
{"text":"I really had never wondered what it would be like to eat my shoes. After having the beef grill cheese I unfortunately now know. The brisket was so dry the pieces clanked on my plate. The bread seemed like it had been toasted for hours. The only thing that added some moisture to the sandwich was the mound of lettuce which otherwise would have been excessive but in this Sahara of a sandwich was most welcome. Thank god for free refills!"}
{"text":"Located just south of Dundas Square, this place make and sell their own beer. Went here after work with my coworkers for some drinks after work, this place was packed. All three floors. I ordered the beer sampler, a pint of Blonde and some beef stew. The beer was okay. The stew was delicious although portion a bit small."}
{"text":"Started out well, then service got slower, and slower, and so slow that eventually they didn't even know who's meal belonged to who. We had to start playing match what was ordered to what was on the dish. 

The poutine was cold. The burger was cold as well. The poutine got sent back and returned in a timely manner which is probably the only reason this isn't a 0 star review. 

Finally, it's taken maybe about 10 minutes to type this out, and I still haven't been able to pay my bill. Would be nice if I could just leave already."}
{"text":"The 3 Brewers has one of the best locations located very close to Dundas Square. It also happens to be an excellent pub with a huge variety of beers. I love their ambience as it is a bit darker and so nice during the summer without the walls at the front. Their food is good - the beer battered fries are a must!

I wish I could give this place a 4, I really do. But their service is SO inconsistent. Sometimes it's okay but other times the servers can be really impatient and rather rude. I understand also that it can get busy but I've had servers that legitimately just take our orders then bring us our food and don't check up on us to see if we want more food. Not cool! The service won't stop me from coming here again for their awesome beers though."}
{"text":"I used to come here quite regularly for their reasonably priced beer and food, and have had mostly positive experiences coming here.  However, the last time I came to the Yonge location I was overcharged and no effort has been made to rectify the situation by management.  

It's very unfortunate that the customer service is so poor, as the place was one of my favourites."}
{"text":"One beer-garita (tip: order it with their white beer instead of blonde beer)

One order of spicy popcorn shrimp with sweet chili dipping sauce

ONE AMAZING SNACK

Math is fun.


PS I'm also very curious about their selection of flammekeuches (sp?) which are basically flatbread pizzas."}
{"text":"We came on a Tuesday night around 9pm. It was not busy at all. The environment is good for groups. Plenty of seats & long tables. 

Service was ok. Food came fast, but the taste was bland. There were seven of us, each of us ordered different dish. Poutine, chicken with waffles, sandwich... non of us like our dish. 

The location is great, beer is not bad. if they improve the taste of the dish, I think I will give it a try again."}
{"text":"I cant remember the last time i visited The 3 Brewers as it was a long time back , so today my family and i decided to have a late lunch there. There is both an inside and outside seating on the patio , my family went for the patio seeing as it was a lovely day outside.

The menu has quite a bit of variety , everything from steaks , different kinds of burgers as well as platter dishes and sandwiches. Seeing as i was craving a burger i opted to order the sriracha burger which is topped with hot peppers , swiss cheese and sriracha mayo with a side of sweet potato fries.

My parents ordered some buffalo wings as an appetizer which took quite a while to arrive and at that moment i knew we would have a bit of a wait with our meals. The main courses arrived about 45 minutes after we were done with our appetizers and i personally am not a fan of waiting such a long time.. i mean who does? Our waitress was quite attentive and friendly so i think the issue came from the kitchen. 

I was excited when my burger arrived. The patty looked juicy and the toppings made the perfect addition , the bun on the other hand was the cherry on top with it being fluffy on the inside with a slight crisp on the outside. Biting into it the beef was tender and in fact very juicy and seasoned just right. 

Sweet potato fries were crispy and just right ... not much to say here but they were great.

Overal my experience food wise was great and the only reason i would give this place a 4/5 was because of the waiting time."}
{"text":"I love this place ... I been to the once in downtown ... I loved the beer ... But this location got more the place is very nice and the environment is amazing the servers were so friendly ... We ordered flames which was so bonerific I will defiantly come here again"}
{"text":"Nice place I always like 3 Brewer . the beer is amazing always busy and always fresh. They keep opening new location wonder why as the food is so good as well. I will recommend all of the brewers and no exclusion to this one."}
{"text":"Very good brown ale.
Tasty short rib and bleu flatbread.
Nice shrimp and beet salad.
On the way down Yonge from the hotel to the Air Canada Centre, and way better than walking through a hailstorm that reminded us of dip'n'dots.
Efficient cute waitress.  Not particularly crowded pre-game."}
{"text":"Had the premium et cetera, meh.  Had fish and chips.  Amazing.  Sat at the bar area.   Attendants were tentative and caring. The only funny thing was there's only one bottle of Tabasco and they had to keep asking to use it.  Ambience is fun and laid back on a Friday night.  Was here for NHL entry draft and being a Toronto city, I wanted to listen to the first overall pick announced, but the manager said no."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with family and friends. The food here is amazing, as is the beer. It's a bit crowded, but given the quality of this place I can definitely see why. The servers are very friendly as well.

Overall, great place to go with a few friends to get food, get smashed, or just chill for a bit."}
{"text":"Sat down at the bar. Bartender was there... then.. HOUDINI!
Where the heck did he go?
Ok, like 5 minutes later he shows up again.. We order drinks.. pretty good beer.
No convo though..
So then we asked for our bills well before having to leave.. got 'em... but guess what?? Yep. WTF.
Finally paid, I'm gonna have to catch the next GO.. not impressed for a \"let's sit at the bar so it's fastsr to grab a quick beer on our way outta town\""}
{"text":"Awesome beer. Unfortunately, Beef Bourguignon is nothing comparable to the french recipe. Beef is dry and served with noodles!.. Disappointing. Served wrong appetizer and served the meal so fast.the waiter said they're always rushing. Tsk!"}
{"text":"Lunch on the patio, I ordered the plain hamburger which was one of the nicest burger, no fillers (breadcrumbs) doesn't look like eggs were added, and not over over seasoned.the service was  quick to ensure the buck to work crowd."}
{"text":"One star was for our server Nicholas who took our order and served our drinks.

KITCHEN was extremely SLOW. It was almost an hour wait just for food.

FOOD SUCKED! My brother and law and I wanted the cassoulet, only to be told then didn't have duck leg. Then I tried chicken and waffles -WAIT WE DON'T HAVE WAFFLES! Wow, the only two items I wanted were not available.

I settled for the sauerkraut - the meat portions were so small, but they gave me enough sauerkraut to last me MONTHS! Tried to eat as much as I can yet there was so much of it left. My wife's flat bread was over baked and 
was almost burnt.

My brother in law found this place online and was duped by the reviews. We will never be back and will tell everyone we know"}
{"text":"Looks like I forgot to write my review for 3 Brewers (Richmond Hill). First of all, I would like to say I was very reluctant to come here because I've been to the downtown location and had a terrible experience, however based on the convenience location and yelp reviews I decided to give it a shot. 
As soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated immediately. The waitress talked to us about their beers and let us sample some, she was really friendly. 
The food is pretty good here, we're big fans of the flat bread, its essentially a super thin crust pizza. The Lilloise is our go-to. The beers are pretty good, they have a few you can choose from which range from white to dark brews. Prices are fair. I've been back once again and received similar service and food quality so I'm please to say I'm a fan of this one."}
{"text":"We missed the beer-braised pork shank and went to the 3 brewers. However, the menu has changed. We ordered poutine, salad and sauerkraut (for the sausages in the plate). It tasted ok and the service was mediocre."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place. They card, but it's okay because it's a bar. They're supposed to. Any students trying to get alcohol, don't bother. I've tried numerous times. 

Food is solid. One of my friends food came out cold but the waitstaff are very nice and reimbursed his entire meal. The problem is service slows down as more people come in, which is usual. I had the pulled pork poutine. Fries were crisp and gravy wasn't too heavy. I've had better though. In terms of selection, their beers are pretty good. (I take sips of my friend's)

Average place."}
{"text":"This is a big place, so usually there's empty spots, even in the busiest hours.  This does not help with fast service though.  Great selection of beer, but the food is very average.  They try to be more creative having some Quebecois and international dishes on the pub-oriented food menu, but they are of average quality and everything seems to taste the same."}
{"text":"I honestly HATE coming to the restaurants at East Beaver Creek, simply because the parking lot is a complete mess and always jam packed. Makes no sense why they wouldn't make underground (or multilevel) parking here to relieve the parking situation here. Nevertheless, I came here last week for dinner and drinks. We really only stumbled in here because we were supposed to go to Honest Lawyer but it closed down without us knowing lol.

Well, I'm glad. Because the food and ambience in here is far better than what we would have gotten at Honest Lawyer. 

This place brews its own beer so naturally, it is a good price. I got a litre of amber for $9.25. Pitchers were going for $14!

The beer itself was pretty good, they have a good description of what each beer is like and even have a bitterness scale and show you how much alcohol content are in each. And each menu item suggests which beer pairs well with it. Pretty neat, and not to mention the menu was printed like it was newspaper! So creative.

I ordered the steak & frites for about $19. The steak was a little small but for $19, it was good. The frites were garlic frites and they were so good! I was still slightly hungry after this, but it's good for next time so I can order an appetizer. Maybe mussels mmm.
 
My SO got some kind of burger that had pulled pork on it and it was pretty delicious too! His side of poutine was a bit tiny. So portion sizes here aren't the best, but what they lack in quantity, they strive in flavour.

Another bonus is there were a lot of TV screens, so it was great to watch the Jays game there. There is a huge screen made up of 9 smaller screens too behind the bar which was conveniently located right in the middle. 

I'd definitely come back to watch a game and have from brews. Maybe I'll come earlier to secure a parking spot lol."}
{"text":"Being backwards this evening, after dessert (see my review for the 'old firehouse') my cousin and I went in search of food. Passing one packed restaurant after another in downtown Unionville, we decided to move to the outskirts and found this place.

Beer is their specialty which made being the DD kind of a drag (not that I like beer anyway). What noticed me was that there was a pretzel on the menu as an appetizer option (spoiler alert: you'll never guess what I ordered.

The pretzel was on the greasy side but otherwise done very well. I wasn't a fan of the sauce options and wish they had given us an option that didn't include mustard. 

The salad also wasn't bad, a perfectly balanced blend of lettuce, cheese, bacon, and Parmesan cheese. Just add a tiny bit more salt and I would be happy.

Servers were slow, price point was higher than expected but overall a good place to try."}
{"text":"Hosted a 40 person party here. It's a great casual place with good beer. Outside of a beer if you want something like an Old Fashion you are out of luck because the liquor selection is limited. Food was okay but the service was great. (Ordered off the group menu). Next time I will try the regular menu."}
{"text":"It is strange but the food here taste a lot better than another location I have visited. Had just a plain burger but it was really good. We had mussels, pizza, and a killer sausage dish for appetizers. The atmosphere with the multiple levels was very nice, and the staff was attentive. Don't kill me but I am not a beer drinker so the options of non beer drinks were limited."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great food. It has a different atmosphere very similar to the ones in Québec. It's also very well located and the staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"3 Brewers is the new hot spot in Richmond Hill/Markham for me and the Crew. This place used to be the Melting Pot (Really thought they would make it) and other failed businesses before that. I think 3 Brewers is here to stay for the long haul because it is now the place to be in the east beaver creek area, and I'd bet a pitcher on that. When the place first opened I was impressed about the selection of food and the service. Unfortunately the more and more I came (others would say the same), the more I saw that the business was slacking. The food was not as good as before, and the service definitely took plunge. It changed my 5 star rating to a 4 star. I was way more impressed with 3 Brewers in Mississauga when I checked it out. Maybe 3 Brewers Richmond Hill will pick up its slack, because we wouldn't wanna see another failed business in that exact building again. If so, we might have to say its a cursed building for business owners. I like that they try to do a new feature beer that is brewed in house. Yeah, that's right they brew their beer in house. How cool is that? Overall I think that 3 Brewers is a pretty stable business and a great place to grab some beers and hang out. As long as a new pub/bar doesn't take over that area. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"Bad food and service.  Our server disappears after taking our drink order, then later stands around talking to her other customers, and FORGETS to put our order in.  Tell us she's sorry, and that she is 'very busy', which is clearly an outright lie.  Mentions the word 'tip' three times in casual conversation over the course of what turns out to be a bad experience.

Half an hour goes by before we get a drink.  We're ready to order and she acts like there are more pressing matters.  We are a polite group of folks and she takes our food order with much eye rolling and a tone of voice that needs to be left at home with her now very apparent bad attitude.  45 minutes later, our food FINALLY arrives and guess what?  Every plate is stone cold.  The portions are also pretty small for the price you are paying.  We tell her six cold plates of food are unacceptable and she kind of laughs us off.  She also didn't take three of the six food orders correctly, and argues with two of the folks would kindly mention this to her.   She also reeks of cigarette smoke...

Don't bother going to this place.  The bathrooms are very dirty and so is the whole place, overall."}
{"text":"Central location, pints of cold beer in heavy glass mugs, greasy bar food and friendly service. That is all you need from a bar, and 3 bresseurs delivers on all four things. Personal beer preference trends towards dark with caramel overtones, so the 3 Brassieres Brown was the perfect choice. Bonus points for not having any weird harsh aftertastes. 

The chilli poutine comes in a shallow metal bowl, standard fries topped with spicy beef chili con carne, cheese curds and poutine gravy. It looks like a mess, but all the necessary flavors and textures are there. The chili wasn't that spicy so it just blended right into the gravy and curds. However, there was an effort to provide a little contrast with some random bites of green onions. Solid bar option when in the area. 

On nice days, they throw open the windows on the ground floor, which makes it the perfect place to people watch and enjoy the warmer weather."}
{"text":"I had a spicy sausage pizza and it was generally good. It was thin and little spicy. Great customer service. We had a very friendly staff who kept asking us if we need anything else."}
{"text":"There is beer. Can't complain."}
{"text":"Ok, first off I'm not a beer fan, so I don't really know what's good quality or taste, therefore I won't comment on that.

But I do love a fine savoury dish and this place just don't carry it. We ordered three house specialities: beer-braised pork shank, tuna-tartar, 3 Brasseurs sausage & sauerkraut. To be honest all 3 dishes were a huge disappointment, lack of taste and seasoning. Nothing special if these are their 'best' dishes. 

I'd a coupon for their Flamm, so we ordered a Manhattan. This was their biggest failure, again lack of seasoning and salt, steak was chewy and overcooked. Glad it was free because frozen pizza taste much better. 

Service was meh, our server was nice and friendly but was way too busy serving other tables while the two hosts just stood around with nothing to do and drank cocktails. 

Restaurant environment was brutal, there was a Jays games going on so they turned up the volume, making it too loud to even talk. They definitely should have a separated bar and family area."}
{"text":"Came to eat while waiting for our show time of Star Wars. My guys were happy with their pizza and onion rings and I was happy to order the squash salad without cheese (my only gf vegan option). Unfortunately the salad had way too much dressing so the flavour was overpowering and the red onions were so strong that I had to punch them to the side. The salad ingredients were nice but I would suggest asking for the dressing on the side.
The server was very nice and she let my son sample a beer before ordering it.
The atmosphere is casual and quite open and the washrooms were clean. Tv screens all around to watch sports and plenty of high and low tables."}
{"text":"This restaurant is much bigger inside than it appears on the outside. There are cool historical artifacts in a display case in the entrance, and huge beer vats at the back. The service was lightning fast (our server was Dan I think), and genuinely friendly. The washrooms are pretty tight, but the stalls are totally enclosed for better privacy. My only complaint was they seated 5 of us at a tall round table for 4 so it was pretty cramped, but we made it work and the servers cleared the dishes very quickly. Also we were under a skylight which made the meal more pleasant. The staff also dealt with a disturbed woman (who splashed me with water in the washroom) very quickly and professionally, despite her yelling the n-word all the way from the second floor until she was escorted out the front door. The poutine had the right amount of gravy, the tuna wraps were fresh and tasty, and the fried cheesecake was delicious. The coffee drinkers said that their brew left a little to be desired, but overall everything was good. Two appetizers, two pints of beer, two mains and one dessert cost two of us $85."}
{"text":"First things first- the beer alone makes it worth a trip here, but I also enjoyed the food and the service was spot on. 
Had the poke lettuce wraps- really nice
And what's better than a weisbier and a pretzel?  Nothing. Their white is a great homage to Bavarian Hefeweizen. Not fruited up or trendy. 
Definitely going again."}
{"text":"As a person very knowledgable in craft beer I was very impressed with their set up & selection. My chicken sandwich & yam frites were delicious. However, my date wasn't as pleased with his meal. I forget what he ordered but I remember there being mashed potatoes, peas and a lot of gravy. The only downside to my experience was I got charged for my side of spicy mayo (yam frites doesn't come with it) . It was only 50 cents or a dollar but I think it's stupid for a restaurant to charge for this. I don't care that I lost the dollar,  it's more the principle of charging for something so inexpensive to the restaurant. Especially when the customer is already spending over $40 on food and drinks per person. Maybe they should rethink charging for something that should be complimentary."}
{"text":"BF and I really wanted to taste the beer at 3 Brewers, so we ordered the Special et Cetera ($9.75).  It is a rail of 6 beers in smaller glasses.  It is perfect for someone who 1) wants to try out a variety of beers in one seating without drinking too much, or 2) can't make up his/her mind.  We enjoyed all the ligher beers.  We found the dark beer too bitter.  If you like bitter beer, you would like the brown.

We ordered a Pulled Pork Nacho ($17.50) and a Reuben Sandwich ($14) to share.  Both tasted rich and bold.  The nachos were nicely crunchy yet not oily.  There was a lot of pulled pork.  It was flavoured with a rich, smoky, and sweet BBQ sauce.  I added hot sauce myself.  The salsa could be of better quality, such as a mix of minced tomatoes, onion and cilantro, instead of from a grocery store jar.  Nevertheless, the nachos were a marvellous shareable.

The Reuben sandwich was a indulgence.  The corn beef was fatty and juicy and flavourful.  There was a LOT of cheese.  The surprise was the house salad that, instead of a typical lettuce salad, was a fresh spring mix salad in honey mustard dressing.  Well done and classy.  The sandwich was of a one-person portion only, so it was too small for sharing.  

The only thing that took away 1 star was the slow services.  We visited on a Monday evening.  The place was obviously not staffed for the customer volume.  It wasn't easy for us to find a waitress for additional food and drink.  The waitress apologized every time for making us wait.  It wasn't her fault 100%, so maybe the management could look into the staffing requirement of Monday evenings."}
{"text":"I had good things about the place, so thought I'd try it out.

Pluses: The food was good - it was definitely fresh, and it was hot. The house-made beer was good (I had the amber ale).

Minuses: 
1. It's loud - as in barely able to carry on a conversation loud. Part of that may have been the crowd, but most of it was the volume on the sound system being turned up so high that I thought I was in a club, not a restaurant. 
2. It's not cheap - I thought the beer would be a bit less expensive, since it's their own, there's no middle-man, no LCBO markup to pay, and no delivery charges since they brew it on-site. It's not really any cheaper than anywhere else. The food was also a bit more expensive than what I was expecting, especially for the portion sizes.
3. To call the order of fries served with my burger \"small\" would be generous, and I couldn't tell the difference between my premium \"beer fries\" and my daughter's regular ones. 
4. The service was slow, indifferent, and inattentive to detail. When our desserts came, there was no cutlery brought with it, and clearly none on the table. We had to ask for some, and were brought a knife and fork. That's really helpful for ice cream, isn't it? 
5. The washrooms are not accessible. If you have mobility issues, you better go before you get there, and hope you don't have to go again before you leave."}
{"text":"I visited Toronto this week with a friend of mine & we stopped into 3 brewers bc we heard they brewed their own beers. Sadly our experience was AWFUL!! Right off the bat out waitress have us attitude. She explained that happy hour was going on & that you could get cheap pints of beer & that they also had a beer of the month. I ordered the beer of the month and she huffed and said, that's not part of the cheap pints! I told her that was fine and I would just take a normal sized beer. She rolled her eyes and walked away. While waiting for our two beers & two waters a group of boys was seated next to us & had the same waitress as us. She served them their beer and took their orders all before even coming to give us our beers!
When we got our beers (she forgot our waters) she asked us if we were ready to order. My friend asked her how big the pizza was bc we were thinking about sharing & wanted to know if it'd be big enough to share. This apparently was a lot of work for her, bc she again huffed and told us it really depended on how hungry we were. I then said, \"I think we are thinking of doing the onion rings and a pizza, do you think that'll be enough food or are the portions small\" She rolled her eyes and said ugh I'll come back in a bit.
I have been to so many restaurants out of town and in my own town where I ask about portion size and the staff is always so friendly and eager to help! But this waitress acted like it was such an inconvenience.
Once we ordered I again asked for water. While waiting for our food, again our waitress brought food out to the boys next to us before us (and they had ordered after us!) when we finally got our food, our waitress wasn't even the one to bring it out, it was the cook! Which I thought was strange considering I watched our waitress bring out food herself to other tables around us! Finally half way through our meal she brought out our waters!!!! She never came to ask how our food was or if we needed anything. After we were finished eating we sat for about ten minutes waiting for her to come check on us. She again cleared the table of boys next to us and gave them their bill and cashed them out & we sat waiting for her to service us!
She finally came and asked us if we needed a box for our left overs and we said yes. She then came back, but didn't bring our bill. So we sat for another 10min finishing our beers waiting for our bill. Never came. So I waited to see her so I could flag her down. But she never came back over to us. We finished our beers and waited another 10 min. Still nothing. I finally got up to go to the bathrooms and on my way stopped a waiter and asked him if he could have our waitress bring us our bill. On my way to the bathroom I watched as the one waiter told out waitress we were ready for the bill. I came back from the bathrooms and STILL NO BILL!! We sat for another 10 min,So 30min total, waiting for our bill or for our waitress to come over and check on us. Nothing. After another 5 min I saw our waitress standing at the bar eating!! I got my belongings, walked over to her and asked for the bill! She huffed, rolled her eyes and said UGH COME OVER HERE AND GET IT! The bill was $37.83. I left 38$ (After that service I was NOT about to leave a tip, which I always leave at least a 20% tip) I put down $38 and my friend and I walked out. While walking down the street I heard someone telling at us to stop. I turned around and THE WAITRESS IS RUNNING DOWN THE SIDEWALK SCREAMING \"YOU DIDNT PAY YOUR BILL!!!!\" I stopped and said \"Excuse me?\" She said in a very bitchy tone\"You need to pay your whole bill!\" I replied that we did and she shoved the money in my hand. I counted $38 out and said \"See we paid!!!!\" She said \"no tip?\" Which then my friend said, \"You were extremely rude & then didn't come back for 35min and left us waiting for the bill..can I ask why?\" She replied with \"whatever. If you don't want to leave a fucking tip, FINE!\" And walked away.

The beer was just ok and the food was just ok too. And with service like that it was NOT worth it!!!!! I have NEVER had such terrible rude awful service in my life!! I can't even believe a restaurant would allow a worker to treat and talk to a costumer like that! I WILL NOT ever go back to this place and I will be sure to spread the word about the terrible service I got. Which I've told about 10-15 people so far and all have said they've heard the same thing. I also posted a picture on Instagram about this experience and a lot of strangers have commented saying how while they visited Toronto they got shitty service as well. So either this place needs new management and new staff or it need to just shut down!!!"}
{"text":"I'd been to The 3 Brewers a few times before and I've never really thought the food was all that great, and yet it's hard to say no when someone asks you to go. There's so much beer to choose from!

This time around, I went with the Traditional 3 Brewers Sauerkraut (\"Smoked Mettwurst and Frankfurt sausages, beer braised pork belly and grilled black forest ham on a bed of beer marinated sauerkraut with boiled potatoes\").

I don't know why I was surprised, based on that description, when I got what was basically a plate of meat. The two kinds of sausage and the grilled ham were very tasty, but the pork belly had been doused in this excessively sweet sauce that kind of ruined it. The sauerkraut was good, too. The potatoes, on the other hand, were practically raw.

Like I said, it was fine. But it was just an excessively meaty dish that could've used something to lighten the plate up. (Even a little broccoli would've been appreciated!)"}
{"text":"Everything about this place rocks.

Servers are fast and friendly.  Our group was loud and quick with witty (so we all hoped) quips and they gave back on both occasions as good as they got.  Made the time that much better.

Liked the look of the place, the bartender actually came over to discuss the decor with us as one of our group was interested in the Edison bulbs.  So that was cool.

The house brews were all great, free samples are a fantastic touch.  I went with the Red Amber first time out then the black second time.  I'm already planning another trip to try the IPA.

First time I had the 3 Brewers burger ( I'm a burger guy, gotta go burger).
It was well put together, cooked to perfection and tasty.  I will be trying more of their burgers in the future.  Not sure about serving fries in a cone, but whatever, they were also pretty good.

Second time in went for the Steak and Frites, for the price the steak was on point and well prepared.

This could turn into a regular spot for me if it stays at the quality it has shown so far."}
{"text":"We went there for company Christmas gathering. At first they have arranged us into 2 separated booth tables, of course we don't feel comfortable, so we have asked the manager to rearrange, and his very helpful. Food are  nice. Especially the mini pepperoni pizza, I like the most."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The gmm is amazing. He did something that he didn't need to just to make our experience better. Thank you guys"}
{"text":"Crowded, noisy. But the mussels were the best I have ever had. Big, plump tasty.  Service was great too. Well located by Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"Interesting night out for my brother and I! We were able to sample all the craft brew available. Staff and manager were super friendly too! It was a fun night!"}
{"text":"The food was OK, mussels were amazing and the premium nachos. Overall good experience with friends but extremely bad service, i guess if we would have sat on the main floor then the service would have been better. Had to wait 45mins for their speciality which is brewed Beers to be served, no servers came to pick it up from the bar table until 15 mins has passed."}
{"text":"Signed up for the brewery tour with Justin and it was awesome! It was very informative, 10 days to brew beer start to finish, who would have thought! They pipe the beer from the back straight to the taps.

They get malt from western Canada, Belgium and Germany. I love this place, will come be back soon!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were visiting Toronto for the first time a few weekends ago.  We were hesitant to eat in this touristy part of town again, since we just had such a bad experience at Jack Astor's down the street.  We popped in here for lunch on a Saturday.  We practically had the place to ourselves.  The interior is gorgeous and big.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.  She actually made me an ice tea from scratch (they only offer yucky Nestea), and she gave us an overview of the Toronto subway system.  I don't know too many servers in the DC area that would be so helpful.  I had a chicken sandwich with goat cheese on it.  Our waitress raved about it, but it was just ok.  Fries were good.  My friends ordered flatbreads, which were also just ok.  One of the flatbreads had only a speck of goat cheese on it.  Not cool.  However, our awesome waitress made up for the average food.  Overall, this is a decent place."}
{"text":"Ok, so flan? No thanks - I'll stick to pizza. The beer's ok, but you can get ok beer anywhere."}
{"text":"Updating review. Disregard any comments made before. That was a non-review and it should be deleted. If I could see how I could do that I would."}
{"text":"Quite the interesting place to go if beer is your poison! They have a bunch of different in-house made beers that will suit even the most picky beer drinkers. You can even sample a few before you choose one you like! But even better, their food is also quite alright for the place it is. When I went I tried the pizza with the unnecessarily complicated name (starts with an F I think :P) and it was better than I thought, you could (dare I say it) almost call it gourmet! Service is also very good; our server was very nice and courteous. Definitely give this place a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a beer drinker so this review based only on the food.

Got a very nice seat on the patio.

They give you a free sample shot of beer to try out.

Manhattan flatbread $16 was okay only. It was shaped like a thin crust pizza. I found the crust to be way too soft. Only the very edge of the flatbread had some crisp to it. The toppings consisted of caramelized onions, cheese and chunks of steak. Overall, found it to be pretty average.

French dip for $15 was another just okay dish for me. The fries were very plain. The meat in the beef dip was soft but it was a mushy soft. Not a tender type of soft at all. The bread was really good and soaked up the aju very nicely. Overall, pretty average once again.

Also tried a sangria beer cocktail at $4.25. Tasted weird to me and didn't really like it.

Food is 3 stars for me but I'm sure they have other dishes which are better. 
Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Been there a lot of times over the years without issue but after having the recommended Cajun chicken, I woke up this morning with food poisoning. 

I'm going to be staying away for awhile, but do NOT order chicken from there!"}
{"text":"Safe bet if you like your standard bar fare.  Pizza and wings are good.  I usually drink lighter beers and the blonde and white are not bad.  Weekends are pretty packed.  Service was on the mediocre side."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in this place.  Other than the beer, nothing else makes it stand out.  We also ordered the sangria with wine, which was the worst sangria I've ever had.  It was garnished with lemon and lime, not even berries!  Was lacking and taste and I can even make a better sangria if I didn't try.  The food was lacking overall. We had the pulled pork poutine which was very dry.  I don't even remember what else we had because it was that unmemorable.  Save yourself the money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I really like the 3 brewers. They have many options for beer that can be paired with your dish. I tried the fish and chips with a blonde beer. Absolutely enjoyed every bite. The beer complimented it as well. I also tried the waffle dessert, which came with ice cream and beer infused caramel sauce. Melt in your mouth awesomeness. Enjoyed the food, the service was subpar. Especially late at night."}
{"text":"Visited 3 Brewers multiple times at the Yonge/Dundas and this was my second time at the Richmond Hill location. 

The decor is nice and spacious. I liked the setup of the booths and seating available at the bar as well. This visit was on a Sunday afternoon for lunch, our server Robert was friendly and attentive. I was a bit disappointed at the lack of service after receiving our food though. It wasn't busy at all and I didn't see our server in sight. 

The food - it's really great they have a kids menu with a decent selection for about 7.00$ including dessert and drink. I ordered the Spicy Sausage and Olives Flammekuche but substituted the olives for mushrooms. The mushrooms were thrown on top and not cooked with the Flammekuche. There was a lack of cheese and tons of roasted red peppers all over. I did not see any banana peppers on it either. It was such a disappointment in comparison to the first time I had it. 

My friend ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich which comes with coleslaw. The sandwich was ok but the coleslaw was sour and tasted off. Definitely not appetizing. 

Kids meal was good - it's hard to mess up \"fried food\". Ordered the Chicken Fingers and fries, it was lightly battered and perfectly cooked. No complaints here. 

Beer was good, no complaints. This is the main reason I come to 3 Brewers for the beer which is never a disappointment. I do recommend the Blonde beer. 

Overall, I was disappointed. When I received the bill I was charged 1.50$ for mushrooms. I was not informed of the additional cost as previously I had done the same thing and I wasn't charged. Our server gave us free voucher for Flammekuche at least and removed the additional charge. I may come back but only for the beer unfortunately."}
{"text":"I like the beer here but the food is overpriced. I think it's average and nothing special to be honest. I rather eat elsewhere and venture here for drinks after. The downfall is it's usually packed but the wait isn't too long. Oh and if you need to use the washroom be prepared to walk up some stairs to get there.

I've tried these dishes: 
Star platter 
Bruschetta and cheese sticks platter 
3 Brewers Sauerkraut 
Portobello Burger 
Maxi Fries 
Italian Flammekueche 

I wasn't impressed but it wasn't bad either. Location is so convenient but the service was average and sometimes certain servers weren't as friendly but sure I'd go back for drinks and some snacks."}
{"text":"Went here while on vacation in Toronto.  I am a craft beer fan, so I figured I would give it a try.  I expected it to be a very commercialized microbrewery, and that was exactly what it is.  The beer wasn't very unique, but it was still good.  The food was delicious, and the staff was attentive.  We sat close to the front, which is open-air in the summer.  It was a lot of fun watching everyone walk by throughout our meal.

Definitely enjoyed it and would go back again for the raspberry beer.  I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"3 brewers? More like 3 brothers! Don't know where I was going with that haha. This place is amazing!!! The food here is bomb and the drinks are all made within, which makes it a really cool. I've ordered all the burgers here and probably my favorite is the their 3 brasseurs burger! I would love to try their other food but I really love the burgers here. The service here is always good or usually* good. I've had one case where the server was kind of slow and didn't really check on us till the end. Overall though this place is still really bomb!

The atmosphere is very chill and decor is nice. They have lots of tvs and show sports or ufc depending on the night. This place can get a bit packed from time to time. The parking lot is complete garbage... if it's a Friday night good luck. There are so many restaurants in the area that finding a spot is like impossible. 

Definitely will be back here!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday dinner with a party of 10. The food and customer service was below average. The food was very dry and plain tasting. I felt like they were trying to make everything all at once so that they can present it all at once. We ordered a lot of appetizers and they arrived along with the main entrees. The meat in the burgers and pulled pork sandwich were very very dry. There was no gravy in the poutine and the cheese was not melted properly. The flatbread felt either overcooked or they cooked it and left it sitting there until it went dry. 

However, I've came here with just my boyfriend before and their food tasted way better. My boyfriend's burger was juicier and my sandwich had life (not dry). So this place is okay if you're not coming with a big group."}
{"text":"It is awesome to have a place so close to home! Great food and local beer!

Staff: They were great and welcoming. When we first came they gave us a sample of one of their beers. Service and food was quick and they cleared our plates in a timely fashion. Top scores!

Ambience: There are plenty of space and music playing the the background. Plenty of large screens airing sports. Seats and tables were very spacious and comfortable. Loved the layout and lots of sunlight!

Food: Very delicious! Had the Chicken Quesadillas and their BBQ Chicken Flamm. It was so filling! The both were much bigger than I anticipated. Should've just ordered one haha. The cheese was oozing from the quesadillas! Will love to go back again.

This is that bar that I was craving for the area and I'm glad to have finally found one!"}
{"text":"Cheap beers, decent pub food, a great place to meet up with friends.

Surprise: A coffee, small cheesecake, and a chocolate mouse for only 6$!

Always a good bet for friday drinks."}
{"text":"This was my very first time at any 3 Brewers and a group of us initially were going to go across at Alice Fazooli's.  One of the members in our group had this brilliant idea to saunter across b/c he had a good experience at the Mississauga location.  

I was SUPER hungry so this review might not actually be 100% accurate but I went with a safe option - the chicken & bacon poutine w/ upgraded maxi fries (beer battered).  They were...phenomenal.  I was totally blown away.  

I think my fries could have had a little more gravy on top but otherwise, it was perfect.  I was actually quite surprised there weren't more people here considering it was a Sunday afternoon.  The whole plaza, actually, seemed a bit...quiet.  

Definitely give this place a try if you ever pass by this area and wonder which of the 20 bajillion restaurants you are going to go to.  Their flat-bread also looked delicious and one of my friends got it and she definitely finished it up!

Finally, they do have local beers and they make their own.  Everyone enjoyed a glass of beer and for the fruity alcoholic drinkers like me, they even had beer cocktails including a rasp-beer-y lemonade, which was delicious :)"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant/bar several times and I keep coming back. Aside from its excellent location in the Yonge & Dundas corridor, it just has a great vibe. From hanging out with hubs for two, to chilling with co-workers, it has the right blend of energy. I also like that it is such a large space with the upstairs and it feels like I am always discovering a different section of the restaurant. I also have found the servers to be quite friendly and usually check in on you from time to time - something that busy pubs at times skimp on.

Now to why I keep coming back. I am not a fan of beer, but beer mixed with sprite, ginger ale, grenadine etc - I am IN. Unlike most pubs where I have to specifically ask for a shandy, and get a \"look\", here, as I say a \"shandy-kinda-girl\" can enjoy a selection of their beer cocktails and not an eyelash gets batted. Afterall, they are even in the menu. Plus the 1/2 pint sizes mean I can try different cocktails for $3.75 each. My favs are the Monaco (blonde beer, grenadine and sprite) and Pannace (blonde beer I think and sprite). 

Food - I have had different foods here and mostly enjoyed them. From the flat bread pizzas, burgers, to the pulled pork sandwiches (DIVINE! not too saucy, great bread, yum!). 

In my humble opinion, stay away from the salads. I was feeling \"healthy\" and ordered their Thai chicken which is $12.99 - the menu description was \"grilled chicken, romaine lettuce, baby corn, bean sprouts, red onions, carrots, tomatoes, oranges, sesame seeds and Asian noodles, served with Thai peanut sauce\". 

Sounds good right? Well what arrived was a plate packed with romaine lettuce, and topped with just a few of these ingredients and 4 small pieces of rubbery, dry chicken. For that price, I would have expected the chicken to be 1) more pieces 2)moist 3) freaking tasty..I can make better chicken than that without even trying.  And for some reason there were two different sauces? Long story short, I wasn't about to eat something I could have thrown together at home 100% better myself. I asked for it to be taken back, which they were nice enough to accept, and I ordered something else. 

But with the exception of the salad mishap,  I still do really like this place, and will come back time and time again."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. The lowest I have given.

Came on a Wednesday night with my friend.  My friend has been wanting to try and so there I was with her.
The first impression of the decor reminds me of Mill St. Brewery@ the Distillery. Understanding it was a week night, there would be less staff...we waited a few minutes before we were greeted by a hostess...where she came out from? ...no clue! We were seated in the bar area?...with wooden chairs that are higher.  Being someone who is under 5 foot 4 in height, it was
a stretch for both of us, literally.  My friend..being a blunt one mumbled, \"out of the wholeee restaurant, they'd pick suck high seats?! They did not even give us any choices! Having been in the food business...I am guessing that they want to seat us where we have enough privacy yet it is within the server's distance...positive thinking!

Food...it took longer than expected. I was never one to remember names of dishes and so I'll describe it on each photo I post

Service...the server looked tired, she used her cheerful tone to introduce us with specials, a bit about the restaurant...but she kinda went MIA after...

Overall, the concept of the restaurant was great, the idea of the dishes were cool...the execution was just poorly done...but hey, the waffle was cold but tasty"}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting The 3 Brewers yesterday evening so I didn't know what to expect.

It wasn't really busy around 5:30 so me and my friend were seated right away. I thought the layout and decor of the restaurant/bar was nice and the newspaper menu was pretty cool. Our server was attentive and we didn't have to wait long for my order (my friend didn't order anything so I was eating alone). However, apparently my friend didn't seem to like the vibe our server was giving off.

I decided to get the peppy. It's basically a pizza but on a very thin flat bread. The first few slices were good but then I noticed how greasy it was. My stomach felt queasy after finishing the peppy but it went away after. I didn't try out their beers because I don't drink beer so I can't comment on how their beers are.

Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back here and trying something else."}
{"text":"Hostesses- super sweet 
bartenders /servers - attentive and very friendly 
Nick at Bar you are the best !!!  
Management : supportive and on point 
All 4 of them ... Big ball of joy 
Restaurant super clean and unique 
Love the the beer taste testers 
Great food ... No ....amazing food ... Mmm lamb shank ... Always a return customer"}
{"text":"Worst meal in a long time. Waiter was useless. My wife ordered a salad and a flatbread. Waiter did not know that they were out of flatbread dough...how do you run out of such a significant item on the menu on a Saturday night ? Then she got her Cajun chicken, mashed potatoes were freezing cold. My burger was small and overcooked. I paid $2 extra for the beer batter fries that were soggy and not very warm. Was looking forward to a good meal at a new restaurant, and will never ever go back."}
{"text":"I was already on my way to eat there, but was greeted by a very nice man who kindly walked me in and called the bartender for me. 

The service here is second to none. They make you feel welcome and I felt like they were genuinely wanting to make me happy. 

I sat at the bar and the bartender was super friendly. Even as the place got busier, they appeared to become even more attentive. My bread basket was never empty, and my drink glass was never less than half empty.

I had a New York steak and everything about it was great. The steak melted under my knife with every bite, and I was completely full by the time I finished.

Talking about customer service, after I was finished paying the bartender made me an amazing espresso. 

I would highly recommend this place, even though it's on the pricier side. It's well worth every penny."}
{"text":"Will definitely come back again! I would recommend the calamari. I ordered the chicken and waffles, I find the waffle itself is a bit over sweet. I heard the amber beer was"}
{"text":"Found out that the Brewers have arrived in Richmond Hill, came straight here after a game of air soft.
This joint is great for fantastic food at a hour when  ghouls come out to play. 
My boyfriend saw the man-mug, the 36oz cup, and could not resist ordering one. So a litre of their White beer worked its way to our table.
We ordered a Beer & Cheddar Soup and  a Caesar Salad to start. Our mains were from the House Specialities, Beer-Braised Pork Shank, 3 Brasseurs Sausage & Sauerkraut, and the Cassoulet.
In the end, we were very satisfied and even have leftovers for the next day."}
{"text":"I was a regular customer there since they opened
We were very happy until a month ago their manager changed the food was cold the service was very poor and the manager was bouncing acrobatically in the bar area to show his bartender skill which was absolutely unnecessary when so much people are waiting to be served 
Overal we wont come back the manager started to bring excuses and he lied about he was a manager there for a long time because we knew the previous one.
We are sorry that the best bar in our area became a bad one just like others"}
{"text":"I don't go out of my way to go here, but when I do end up at 3 Brewers I wonder why I don't go more. If you aren't sure what type of beer you want to try they offer flights and if you are sure, you can get a mug that will hold a litre of it!  Why not?! There's usually a feature beer, last time it was a beer brewed with rye and it was phenomenal. I went once just for appetizers and we had some kind of platter with an assortment of deep-fried things that was nothing great (but I guess you can't be shocked when you order something like that) but on another visit I've tried their thin crust pizza which is pretty tasty. Most recently I had the smoked salmon & baby shrimp salad (I wasn't expecting much but was attempting to get something I could at least pretend was healthy) and honestly, it was one of the best salads I've had in a long time.  My friends were very pleased with their meals too, and plus they have beer cocktails, so you can't go wrong there!  Unfortunately the washrooms are a million miles away, and the barrels of peanuts are gone now for some reason.  However, still an interesting atmosphere and good beer!"}
{"text":"Favorite place after my week in Toronto!  Went here with a huge group of work people late on a Thursday night and we ordered a ton and they smiled and took it on with a great attitude.

Not every place is that welcoming.  We drank liters of beers and ordered meter sticks which was awesome to see.

The food made me think Octoberfest in Decemeber and it was great!

Cool cool locaiton....stay classy now!"}
{"text":"this bar is awesome! Great location and fair price! I ordered a pulled pork sandwich it comes w salad! Didn't try the wine bc I'm nonalcoholic haha. Will come back next time?"}
{"text":"I've been to a different 3 Brewers in Mississauga & it was a pretty good. This location...not a great experience. The service was s-l-o-w! Our server seemed less than interested & his service level showed it. 20 minutes to get my first (& only) drink. 35 minutes to get our appetizers!? The appies (Calamari & Fajitas) were only average. The Salsa has a strange red glow to it so we didn't eat it. 

The shift manager came buy to ask how everything was & I mentioned how slow the service was but he didn't seem to care only pointing out how busy the outside deck was & a couple of large parties inside. 

Lesson learned for me....GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!"}
{"text":"This was a mid-afternoon lunch with a close friend. This place is an ACTUAL brew pub. Has multiple beers on tap and many are in-house brewed. 

The food was surprisingly good. I had the Poutine that was delicious but very salty. Also had the chicken pico de gallo that was excellent with an amazingly tasty garlic house dressing. All in, this was pretty good with a reasonable price. A do-over."}
{"text":"Went back to the 3 Brewers for a friend's birthday yesterday and decided to try one of their flatbreads.  All of us ordered a flatbread, so we could try different ones.  I'd have to say that the best ones were the short rib one and the mushroom flatbread.  Both were very tasty.  The others are good as well, but those two have the most flavour.  I also decided to try their House Salad that comes with their own beer vinaigrette dressing.  I know it was only a salad, but it had plenty of grape tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions,  and red peppers.  I really enjoyed the dressing.  It had good flavouring and was quite refreshing!  I definitely would give them a better review this time because the food and service was much better the second time around. Maybe it's because it was Saturday afternoon for lunch, but overall, everything was good.  We were actually very pleasantly surprised that they were able to split the birthday boy's bill evenly between the group of us.  After this experience, I would definitely come back and try something else.  Again, if you love beer, they've got lots to choose from that are made in house."}
{"text":"Never been a fan of this mini chain. Food is lifeless and bland. Wouldn't recommend especially with this price range there's far better options."}
{"text":"Last night was my second visit to the Richmond Hill location of 3 Brewers, overall I'd give it 3.5 stars.
I enjoy it's uniqueness in the cluster of restaurants located at 404 and highway 7. Right by the window, you see its equipment for brewing their in house beer.
I ordered their rasp-beery lemonade to start ($5). They offer around 5 beer cocktails in the $5-6 price point. It was a nice size and tasted delicious. It was girly enough to be slushy, pink and pretty, but you still taste all the beer undertones, well worth the price I say (base on this alone, I'd give it 5 stars). They offered us free beer samples after our server asked what their preferences were and my friends went with their feature beer (not sure which one) but both liked how special it was, although both said they'd prefer their usual commercial ones.
We got the ploughman platter ($19) to start, it had 2 cheeses, some prosciutto, salami, pickled veggies, bread, pear and fig jam. It was a wide spread but I would have preferred less variety and more quantities of each instead. The brie & prosciutto was beautiful but not enough to share, whereas we had not so popular items (the other mystery cheese & pickled veggies) and no one wanted to finish them.
I also got the new chicken pesto flamm, which is their signature pizza like flatbread. The flavours were delicious but I found it a little soggy and greasy. My friends got roasted chicken (he loved it) a full rack of ribs. The full rack($29) was good portioned, atop fries and onion rings, served with some coleslaw. It smelled really good because of the beer bbq sauce, but my friend didn't find it tender enough (no falling off the bone action).
Because I didn't want to fight for the bill with our friend, I went up to pay first...which seemed to be a mistake, since after that the server didn't come around our area anymore. We would have liked more water and a box for our leftover food.
It was a great experience and I'd come again."}
{"text":"Came to 3 Brewers for a Holiday Lunch with my Department. I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich. Despite the portions being a good bang for your buck, I felt my sandwich was a bit too salty. 

Service was good though for our large group but it wasn't super busy. This would be a good spot for after work drinks as their location is large."}
{"text":"For this first time experience, the place offers decent food at a reasonable price at this eaton Center location. Highly recommend their pork shank! For drinks white beer for ppl who like a fresh taste. The sangria is also a nice choice for girls."}
{"text":"Justas the manager at 3 Brewers responded to all my concerns. I gave them another try and my experience was top notch. I will be back. Thanks."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to checking this place out. It's been on my to-do list for awhile. Unfortunately, it was a bit of a disappointment for me food-wise, hence the 3-stars. So I'll start there. I ordered the Brie Blue Burger, which looked great but tasted ok. The balsamic reduction was nice, but that was about it. The burger was 'meh'. But the bun was stale which was a huge bummer. The whole time I was eating it, I kept thinking to myself 'this is really disappointing you need to stop', but I just kept going, determined to finish it in it's entirety. The fries were great though. Firm and crunchy, nicely seasoned. For drinks I ordered the Rasp-Beery Lemonade. It was good but not great. Again, seemed a little bland, but it wasn't overly sweet which I'm not a fan of. The service, however, was great. I was with a group and got there just a little after everyone else did. The hostess greeted my friend and I with a smile before letting us head to the table where the rest of our group was seated. It wasn't long before a waitress came around to order our drinks (the rest of the group having ordered already) which was great. I was thinking that we would have to flag someone down! She checked on us throughout the meal, but not to the point where we felt we were being bombarded and if we were low on beverages she was there to ask if we wanted another, etc. So over all it was a pleasant experience, but I was a little disappointed with the food. I may try this place again as there are quite a few 4 and 5 star reviews. And once again, I forgot to take pictures! *lol*"}
{"text":"Their food is uninspiring. I used to love the flammes (thin Pizzas) when there was more variety but they've scaled it down in this particular location (Yonge/Dundas)."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for lunch. Food and drinks were pretty solid quality, though some things are over-priced. I'd recommend their Maxi fries: super crispy but the inside is soft and perfectly potato-y. Their sandwiches and burgers are amazing, especially their French Dip ($16). Unfortunately, the sweet pot fries I got were a tad raw and the service was super slow (took us 2.5h because our waiter was always off talking to other people) to point where the hostess stepped in a few times to take our order and grab our bill. Overall an okay experience for the food, but it could've been better given the service."}
{"text":"Love the food and hate the beer.

Not a fan of their beers - HOWEVER that have an interesting 'sampler' of their 4 beers I believe?? Goes the the golden brand to the amber dark ale (yuck!).  I also tried their Maple Beer that is bottled from Montreal - that was quite interesting as well but I wouldn't go for that again.

I love their set up of the main bar downstairs but there is additional seating upstairs as well. You can munch on some peanuts if you're just there for a game and some drinks.   

If you're going to food you have to get the Flat bread pizza.  You can't go wrong and they are perfect for sharing. 

Can someone tell me what is up with the bathroom situation?? 
They should really have one downstairs on the main floor.
Make sure you're not busting to go to the bathroom because you have some hiking to do - 3 flights of stairs and then all the way across... it's a little bit much! 

Overall though a nice place and always full with people.
I won't penalize them for me not liking their beer because that is everyone's choice, but I would definetely go here again to watch a game with a crowd of friends :)"}
{"text":"My *the* goto place if I am in that part of downtown. It's a microbrewery, so of course the beer selection is good. Food is decent as well as pub food goes. Service is always good. Only down side is that their washrooms are located at a weird level (you have to climb up and then climb down a few flight of stairs)....a bummer if you are drinking copious amounts of beer! :). But that doesn't keeps me from coming back! cheers!"}
{"text":"The food was great. The drink prices are great. The services is great. And I like the feel inside. I just wish there was a little more TV's."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night with a couple of friends to chill..

Place is spacious, but didn't have enough TVs..

Surprisingly the bill was pretty cheap..

We ordered the one meter beer twice.. it's 10 half-pintes of their in-house brewed beer from blonde to dark.. I think it was about $30 and included a free medium pepperoni pizza.  The 10 half-pintes comes in a nice display and the pizza crust was super thin with barely any crust (comes is a oval shape).  Pizza did taste pretty good..

We also ordered the \"platter\" appetizer and the \"sausage and ham\" platter main course.  Sausages were super tasty and the slice of honey glazed ham was sweet and garnished nicely.

Overall i would recommend to go here with a couples of guys to chill and have beers.. maybe consider coming here for some food with a date if she likes trying different beers.. the food here isn't bad!!! Wouldn't come here to watch a game, nor would it be a top choice for date night in my opinion.

Bill only came up to $102 plus tip for 10 half-pintes of beer, 2 medium pizzas, 1 appetizer, and 1 main course.."}
{"text":"The self-brewed beer is very tasty as is the pub food, although the selection is limited. Their locations are always huge so the wait for a table is usually either short or non-existent. Seems to be ideal for after work drinks and great for large groups."}
{"text":"It pains me to give a place bad reviews, and I rarely do. I usually can find something to focus on that was positive. I don't have any of that here. Service was slow and unenthused. Food was just ok. My fish wasnt terrible, but it wasnt good either. My wife got the bruschetta and hated it and she isnt picky. All of those things could be overlooked if it wasnt for the fact that its a microbrewery and the beer was terrible. We ordered a flight and my wife turned her nose up to every one. I didnt like any enough to order another. Disappointing."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic pub. It has three floors, is in an ideal location, and the ambiance is terrific. The bartenders are always very friendly and attentive, and the drinks on tap are always plentiful. I love their cocktails. Great hangout spot for a group or a date."}
{"text":"Usually come here for their Amber beer. It's a very loud environment which doesn't make it the best place for conversation. A few of my friends ordered a few cheesecakes and they weren't to be seen until 30-45 min after. Waiter got them the discount of their dessert though.

Not the best food, but I am a fan of their beer."}
{"text":"HORRID! 

On one cold night Vivian and I ventured out to grab some dinner, we were tired of our old haunts and thought we were try this place....it was my suggestion....a very BAD suggestion I might add! 

When we arrived the place looked full, but didn't have a line, so we figure ok. Well we stood at the front for about 15 mins with out even being acknowledged by a staff member. There was no hostess or anything, just a stand with no one behind it. Some people behind us ventured around to find the washrooms, and when they returned they told us that they had a full 3rd floor that was empty.....so why was there a line? It's the holiday season and you're in the heart of Dundas square, expect to be busy! I finally grabbed someone who, btw didn't speak the best English, and demanded that our name be put on some kind of list. After another 20 min wait at the door we were finally seated....by the cold drafty door and window! I'm not happy at this point. Trust me, a cold, hungry redhead is not a good combination! 

The server we had was either new, or just the worst server on the face of the planet! It took her forever to come greet us, forever to take our order and forever to clear our dishes. She didn't offer us nuts, like everyone else had and offered no advice on the menu. Speaking of menu, it lacked any selection and good choices. 

Once the food came, it was blah...my chicken burger was so tasteless and the bun was so big it was stupid. The amount of fries was an upset as well. For $12 I expect more then that. Viv's pizza was so thin the cheese on it was thicker then the dough, and by the time she had gotten to the last slice it was cold. 

When the bill came, we went to pay with interact....it was 2009 after all, and 99.9% of places have interact....but no, not this place!!! We were forced to use their ATM and pay the fee!! NOT COOL!!! 

If I can save you all from going to this place, my 2010 will be a success."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday during the holidays to try out the local brews on tap. A nice clean place with friendly service and sports on the big screen.  Only downside for me was how dead the place was but understanding it was day of Sabbath and during the holidays.  Will try this place again and order the large beer tasters on the beer menu fasho."}
{"text":"We had supper Saturday at 3 Brewers.

They brew their beer onsite.  I had a Blonde and Gord had a couple IPAs.

Gord ordered a Lille Flammekueche (it's like a pizza with no tomato sauce).  He said it was delicious and he would order it again.

I'd had mild wings at their location on Adelaide Street in December and they were soooooo good!  So that's what I ordered today along with a side of fries.  The wings here were just okay.  They weren't big like I'd had in December (you'd think the restaurants would be consistent) and it seemed like they'd been sitting around for a while (they weren't hot).

I won't be rushing back to this location, though I would head to the other one for beer and wings."}
{"text":"Saturday Night: HOCKEY NIGHT!!! The leafs might suck but this place doesn't. 

I made a reservation for 4 people and I'm glad I did. All the tables and the bar were packed! Our table was waiting for us when we arrived and we were greeted by the friendly front staff. 

It has a real cool ambiance , with the microbrewery in sight. Their beers are tasty and their beer cocktails are fun too! 

Their menu isn't too extensive but everyone will find something. Their nachos are quite large, perfect for sharing. Their ribs looked great (saw a bunch of orders going out) and their sandwiches are awesome. 

I would expect them to give a few more fries with their sandwiches as they gave about 10-15 with my friends sandwich. 

Overall it was a good experience except for our waitress (yazz) was not attentive at all.... Didn't fill up water , never brought napkins when we asked and she didn't check on us. Thank god for other waiters around because they brought us water , napkins and hot sauce. 

I would return for a other hockey night but not to eat, prob just too drink and snack."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a beer bar... salmon salad was good, the wine list was terrible/cheap wines, but plenty of beer made on site. (Just upgrade the wines, might as well be the best for everyone right?)
Of course loud, loud, loud. Don't come here to talk!"}
{"text":"While I typically don't like chains nor do I really like much about the French, this place is always a go to for me when I'm in Toronto. They brew some pretty good beer on site and am I glad that the IPA is now a mainstay on the beer list. The amber is also a very good brew. They constantly have about a half a dozen brews on tap along with a few seasonal guest brews. They also make a variety of beer cocktails and have a good whisky selection, so you're guaranteed to find something you'll enjoy. It's also wonderful to watch the bartenders' reactions when some ass walks in and tries to order a mass produced piss beer like Bud or Molson.

The main thing that makes this place wonderful is the staff. It's always nice to walk into a bar in a foreign city and be treated like a regular. When I was here last Wednesday, I was sitting at the bar and being served by a lovely and friendly bartender named Sarah, who I had never met before. She noticed that I was writing stickers and immediately perked up and mentioned that she'd been told about me. I almost always sit at the bar, so I can't comment on the table service, but the various servers are always friendly and chatty while waiting at the bar for their drink orders to be filled. My favorite bar back, Kumal, has moved on to bigger and better (or smaller and worse) things, making the move to Winnipeg, but he's been replaced by an equally friendly bar back. It's pretty impressive when the bar backs are as conversational as the actual bartenders. Speaking of bartenders, any review of this place would be incomplete without mentioning the wonderful Cynthia, who has made me feel at home from the very first time I stumbled into 3 Brewers. She works on Fridays and Saturdays and is just a joy to be around.

The food at 3 Brewers is okay. I usually eat the chicken quesadilla, solely for the NAFTA irony of being an American eating Mexican food in Canada. The music is a bit too poppy and in your face, but you get used to it after a few drinks.

Overall, this is a great place to stop in for a quick bite or endless hours of drinking your face off."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved The 3 Brewers in Quebec when I first discovered it with my friends. The beer are all brewed in-house and that's what I absolutely love about this place. I usually get whatever the beer that they're featuring for that month if they sound delicious, if not....my go to beer there is the white beer - pint or 36oz. size. 

I usually get a flatbread pizza, also called Flammekueche. My favorite is the Manhattan which consist of steak, cheese and onions. The flatbread now isn't as flaky as before. The quality of the pizza has definitely went down over the years. This time around, I did order that flatbread pizza, and my bf ordered a mac and cheese grilled cheese. The grill cheese was good, it came with a sirracha ketchup dip. The sweet potato fries were a $2 extra charge and these used to be the bomb. They used to be skinnier fries that were super crispy but now....they're the bigger version and not as crispy. 

Since all the changes, my opinion of this place has went from a woot woot to a a-ok. The quality of the food has definitely changed over the years."}
{"text":"We decided to grab a bite to eat here after seeing a show at a theater next door - huge mistake!  I guess we should have realized it was more of a place to drink beer than have a meal. 

 The hamburgers are some strange  funky tasting mystery meat.  My lackluster chicken tenders salad had wilted lettuce with 3 very small over cooked chicken pieces.  The nachos were not much more than a huge pile of chips with a bit of cheese, hot peppers and salsa on top.  I guess the best meal amongst our group was the entree with 2 sausages/sauerkraut. 

Avoid the food like the plague!"}
{"text":"I went to 3 Brewers after a movie night with my cousin (on a Sunday around 10pm), and had one of the most negative service experiences I can remember.  It's rare that I decide to email the management of a restaurant directly with my complaints before posting a Yelp review, but I did, thinking that maybe they weren't aware of these issues, but after reading all the other poor reviews on Yelp and elsewhere, it's clear that this place has been mismanaged since opening.

When we arrived, the hostess asked if we wanted to be seated at the bar.  There were only 2 of us, and there was literally no one else seated at the bar, so I asked for a hightop table instead, as there were signs of life in that section of the place.  

A brunette waitress came over and asked for our drink order shortly afterwards, and we asked her to give us one more minute - pretty standard.  About a minute afterwards, a blonde waitress walked over and said \"Hi, I'll be your new waitress\".  We were confused.  It had only been a minute, and it didn't appear that the other waitress was going off shift, but we shrugged and ordered.  Our drinks arrived quickly, and then the brunette waitress walked by our table with a very confused look on her face.  She looked surprised to see pints on our table.  She then took orders from a near-by table, but was staring at us with a really sour look on her face nearly the entire time she was dealing with those patrons!  I said to my cousin that I suspected perhaps that the blonde waitress had stolen her table - it was very strange.  She agreed that something was up, as she was getting dirty looks from the server too.  

We didn't see our blonde waitress again at our table, but saw her behind the bar and working another section of the restaurant.  Our pints ran dry, and no one asked us if we needed more for 20 minutes.  Then the first waitress, the brunette came by, and said, \"Do you guys need anything?\".  We said, \"Just the bill please\", and she said \"OK, No problem, I'll let YOUR waitress know.\".  We were certain there was some sort of server disagreement going on at this point.  Our blonde waitress didn't come with the bill, instead a tall man with grey hair brought the bill fold.  This was the third person now to serve us.  I paid cash, and he handed me back the bill fold with change = a loonie, some nickels, and a $5, making it impossible to leave a reasonable tip without asking him to return to break the $5.  I found it presumptuous of the server, as though they expected me to leave the $5 to avoid the trouble, as the $1 and nickels wouldn't have been sufficient.  This was a $14 bill because we just wanted to leave at that point.  20% Would have been $2.80.  Also, if you approach a table for the first time in the night as their server, introduce yourself to the patrons, don't just walk up and put a bill in their hands.  

The bottom of a patron's glass should never run dry before they've been asked if they want another.  A manager should be controlling the waitress roulette situation before staff disagreements arise and become very apparent to patrons and makes their experience uncomfortable.  The restaurant was barely busy, and I counted at least 4 staff on the floor, so why three different servers?  It was a really strange end to what would have been a wonderful evening, and our bill would have been much higher had we felt we were having a good time."}
{"text":"Came her after work with a buddy for some drinks.  I love the concept, and the waitress was very sweet and helpful.  However, where this place goes downhill is with the food.

We ordered the calamari and popcorn shrimp.  Both tasted like it was bought pre-packaged at the grocery store and heated up in a microwave.  The beer was also okay, but not great.

Hopefully they can improve on the food quality, as they have a good thing going otherwise."}
{"text":"I like to think of myself as a beer connoisseur and I have to admit, the 3 Brewers does an exceptional job with their small list of beers. This was my first experience at the Oakville location and it was definitely on par with the one in Toronto. I am looking forward to watching some leaf games there this season. GO LEAFS GO!"}
{"text":"My friends I come there at least once a month and it's always such a good time. Friendly staff, great beer - there are options for all kinds of beer, and delicious food. A must-go if you're visiting Yonge-Dundas!"}
{"text":"It's a chain bar/restaurant based out of France. So think Gabby's, but with French style and flavour. The house beers are better than your average Molson/Labatt brew and the food is solid as long as you stay within the house theme. The frites are great and the seasonal Octoberfest platter (3 kinds of sausages, schnitzel, pork loin and saurerkraut) was an great choice for two.

The vibe is corporate gastro-pub. Take that as you will, but it's well-executed and proves there is more to French food than wine and haute cuisine. It's a hike to the washroom if you're sitting in the front. And it can get rammed on party nights.

I like it better than every other corporate sit-down restuarant in the Eaton Centre area and will go there again."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and the waitress was very attentive! I got the mac and cheese sandwich. Brilliant. The bread it came on was buttery and greasy in the most perfect way. Cool atmosphere too."}
{"text":"A great pub style restaurant! The menu is always changing so don't get attached to any items. I like the staff and how they make you feel welcome. The food quality is good and the patio is nice. The fact that it's a working brewery really adds to the experience."}
{"text":"Great place with wonderful beer choices.  Went in during our short stay in Toronto and had to go back.  Service was good and a nice menu.  We split a flatbread pizza each night and they were great.  Definitely worth a try - we'll be back when in the area."}
{"text":"Service sucked because they were severely understaffed, although it is very easy to satisfy me because I'm accustomed to the inattentive service in Europe. 3 sausage (their signature dish) was soggy and cold inside. The salad we ordered was extremely boring (I make better Mediterranean salad at home). Beers were not cold enough. What else is there? Terrible place. Not a Belgian/french gastropub, just a cheesy tourist trap."}
{"text":"Friendly and accommodating service at this local spot. We stopped in for lunch and ordered pretty standard fare. Given my allium avoidance my options were limited but they happily accommodated with a house salad with an addition of feta cheese. Healthy lunch with nice salad greens, peppers, tomato and cucumber slices. Others at the table ordered hamburgers with and without cheese plus some salty fries and side salads. Overall was a standard experience and not earth shattering culinary excitement as you would expect from a brewery. We did not indulge in the beer as it was lunch but there was also nothing calling out to us to start our happy hour early."}
{"text":"We left the place after 20 minutes because it was so cold , we sat there with our winter coats and it was still cold. Maybe you want to try it on a warmer day. I hope until that day they turn their music down too. It was almost impossible to have a conversation."}
{"text":"I've been here about 5-6 times and I'm never disappointed. This place has their own microbrewery which is very fascinating. They make their own beer. The prices of the beers and cocktails are inexpensive yet taste amazing. There's a huge variety of flat breads. A few of my favorite things to order is the calamari, popcorn shrimp, flatbread chips, poutine with their beer battered fries, and the steak and mushroom flatbread. I honestly love this place. 

This one time when it got really busy I had to wave/stare down a manager to order dessert. When the manager came back she told me it was on the house because no customer should ever have to wave a waitress down in order to be helped. It was sweet and unexpected. I just wish the seats were a tad bit more comfy but it's a bar ... So I'll definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Bland food all over the board. Charcuterie was decent. Wings were ok. Lamb shank was bland even the jus was bland, mashed was bland too. Tuna tartar had no seasoning what so ever you just can taste the lemon, flat bread had a good dough but light sauce, again bland. Onion soup was good. Sausage with potato was ok, potatoes were bland. 
This place needs salt
Our server ally was excellent."}
{"text":"Otherwise known as \"The Three Brewers\" this pub is more like a beer hall, located right in the centre of it all across from The Eaton Centre. So if you're around Yonge and Dundas Square and need to get a quick pint, this is your place.

VIBE
BUSY. Always bustling. This place is perfect for large groups. Lots of floors. The wait staff seem harried and overwhelmed especially with larger groups. I don't blame them. They seem to have a system in tact and give everyone a number so they can settle the bill. Always ensure to have split bills here or otherwise, it's going to be a nightmare! 
Also, it's dark and loud. I can still have a decent conversation though. 

I DRANK
If you're looking for your brand name pint, you ain't getting it here. Everything is in-house from their brewery. There's quite a few selections. I had the Blonde. And if you want a demi (or a half pint), done and done. Plus, for under $5 for a demi-pint you really can't go wrong. The food and ordering can take a while. Once you sit down, know what you want or otherwise, it's going to take a while! It's your standard pub fare but the fries were tasty! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK
You gotta have the name in both French and English. Come on now!"}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed with this place. The menu was actually better when it first opened a couple years ago. It had some really creative things that were well executed on, but that wasn't the case when we were there in the fall and again over the holidays. The food quality is ok but not great anymore, pretty standard pub fare. Their own beers are fresh, but tend not to be excellent.

I probably won't return."}
{"text":"I consider myself almost a regular. Lol. 
Yummy beer+great company=cant go wrong.
One noteworthy item on the menu, the apple pie w/ice cream. It was interesting. It looks like a pizza. caramel drizzle all over with ice cream in the center. Perfect size for sharing. Unique apple pie experience , worth trying!"}
{"text":"good beer selections :-) 
and good snacks, service is good too

Very convenient location it's just across from eaton centre"}
{"text":"4* for the cool atmosphere, the menus looking like an old-school newspaper and the awesome beer-cocktails AND the very nice servers who work here!

the food itself is also pretty decent but not totally amazing. it's a nice experience although probably not my go to location for anything really. probably nice to go with friends"}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favourite lunch/dinner places to go to. The staff there is really nice and it's a great place to chill with friends, but the environment can get pretty loud on busy days, especially near the bar. The beers and most of the food are pretty good. You'll be seeing me around often!"}
{"text":"What a neat place... with its own brewery.
I was here for a paint night event and afterwards we stayed for dinner.
I got mussels and duck confit poutine.  Both was amazing!!!  My friend got machos with chicken... she said itnwqs good.Qe were well taken care of."}
{"text":"Nice pub for beer drinkers and good bar food. If you're a meat eater, try the chicken and waffles with sweet potato fries. If you're a vegetarian, I'd say the sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese flatbread is the best value for money. Nachos aren't the greatest at this location, compared to the one downtown at 275 Yonge St."}
{"text":"Sat for 15 minutes not a single person looked at us. The worst service I have ever seen. Too bad the beer is quite good but I will not be visiting this franchise ever again."}
{"text":"Came in with a friend a few nights ago for a drink and bite to eat. Quite happy with the friendly service and how fast things came. Also liked being informed of the specials (4 dollar blonde beers) were great. 

Friend asked for a specific type of fries but got the wrong one and got to keep the previous and got the right fries very quickly. Small things like that are always nice. 

Always happy to visit the 3 brewers."}
{"text":"great beer  these guys really upped their game  i ben there couple of times before and their beer wasn't something great, but now it came together. i had a burger and few different beers and i can safely say that it might be the new favourite place to go to for a really fresh beer."}
{"text":"The charcuterie platter is amazing. Roasted peppers eggplant. Italian sausage, cheese, bread, salami, pickles and other meats. Very nice. Give it a try to share."}
{"text":"Came here with my cousins for some Canadian beer and wings. There was a line and they had us wait 30 mins.. once we got inside I found out this restaurant is 3 stories (really nice) with empty tables everywhere.. the menu was cute it explained where they got the names of all the French specialties. the service was bad, waitresses would spend hours at one or two tables and neglect all the others..mhhhmmm 
food was ok and the beer was good. This would be a really fun place to do a party with friends or to go watch a game since there are tvs everywhere. I'd say it's kind of like our yard house with less options to eat."}
{"text":"Great place in downtown Toronto for some drinks and apps. They have a nice selection of beers. The apps are a bit limited but they have some tasty options. I had the tuna poke salad app, very delicious and delicately prepared, flavourful and a perfectly developed app. Had the goat cheese and roasted red pepper sandwiching with a Caesar salad, a great light option for dinner. Would recommend this place more for their beer selection. Place is open late and great option before heading out to a show or to the movies.
Enjoy"}
{"text":"I'm downgrading this place to 2 stars.  If you're going here? I wouldn't suggest eating anything.  On my last visit, my sister and I shared the Louisiana Flammekueches (it's basically a thin crust pizza) and we both got sick from it.

The service was also ridiculously slow.  Our waitress seemed more concerned with cleaning and setting tables for the next day than ensuring current customer's needs were met.  More than once she saw me trying to get her attention, and just looked the other way.  Not impressed.

It is, however, a nice looking space and I like the ambiance the soft lighting provides.  The beer is also decent.  If they smarten up with service and stop serving poisonous food, it would actually be a great spot."}
{"text":"In Toronto for a night with the family (2 teenagers and 1 adult) and spent a whole walking around. Found this place and decided to try it! The service was great! The hazelnut salad is perfect size and tastes amazing. The flatbreads are all perfectly cooked also. For dessert we ordered the apple crumble flam and it was huge! Good for 3-5 people for only 8$! Can't complain. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Good staff, great place to watch a game. Food is great especially their flatbreads. Great portion!"}
{"text":"I had higher hopes for this place but can't say it was all bad. Perhaps we got unlucky with the food quality this time as I've seen some pretty plates come out (the meats, flammekueches). The fries that came with the classic burger were the saddest part of the meal - stale, flavourless, no texture. Burger was mediocre at best, but also lacked flavour. You had to douse it in mayonnaise to taste anything (which was quite good, if I may add). We also ordered the pulled pork poutine and the fries were, again, the biggest letdown. Onion rings were fairly good, but that's about it. If anything, screwing up onion rings would be a bigger accomplishment.

On the other hand, we ordered a pitcher of the amber ale and it was very good. Very smooth, hints of sweetness, not too bitter. Service was fine in our experience and the environment was enjoyable too. We were seated on the second floor next to the window and it wasn't so busy when we came around 6pm on a Wednesday. I noticed they don't play music here, and it's a great volume for chatter.

I'd be curious to see if their food can impress if I give them a second chance. Best to come here for the beer and save the main course for elsewhere.

---
Edit: came here again at a mixer. This time I had: flammekueches in 5 equally disappointing flavours; dry and tough, somewhat burnt kebab skewers; mediocre and overpriced sangria, great deep fried pickles; and very delicious buttered pretzels (but none that could rival an authentic German bakery). Their tester bar is not bad, $30 for 7 pints or so?
Review is unchanged because food is still generally bad, a sentiment most people at my table agreed with. They also do play music (good music, may I add), contrary to my prior review, perhaps because this was later during a Friday."}
{"text":"Came for dinner. Good beer selection (and reasonable prices). We had a couple of burgers, cassoulet, and the mac & cheese grilled cheese.

All the food was good, although the cass may have been a bit too salty. There's a beer for everyone here, so ask for a sample to get the style you like.

Second time here in 10 days, so yes, I'll be back."}
{"text":"For tourists unfamiliar with the area, this was a really fun place. My husband and I stopped in after roaming the downtown area and we were seated right away (we went on a Saturday evening) ! Our waitress was so friendly and was ready with recommendations. The food was okay, we had some appetizers,  tasters like ordinary pub food. They also did not have a huge beer selection but we tried the pale ale and it was tasty. Its a great place to come if you're downtown and are looking for a place to relax while having good beer and pub food."}
{"text":"If you like to try new beer. This is the only place to go worth while in the downtown area. Located right at Yonge and Dundas, this place has the most interesting selection of home grown beer I've seen in a long time. Their pizzas are very good as well. 

It has a nice friendly pub type atmosphere and the staff are very friendly even when it is busy. They are always making up new beers so you know you've come to the right place by the intoxicating smell. 

Can't go wrong with this place. Just wish it was a little faster with the service on the lunch hour."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, I haven't eaten here but rather come for the micro-brewery. If you like beer, and you like trying something new... check it out. 

If you can't decide what beer to have, you can order a row of mini-pints. Or, depending on your mood you can order a metre of full pints and opt for some snacks or two extra pints. If you dont want snacks that's 10 pints for $50 including a tip, a great way to sample their beer selection! 

The place is unique in design, and a bit confusing.  It's multi-leveled and all I can say is follow the yellow dots to the washroom haha."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place where I have had Flamms..! And it was yummmilicious to be true . 
And the calamari rings , hot wings and brownies were wonderful and the service was good too !"}
{"text":"I have been to this location multiple times and I really like it. In the summer, there is a beautiful plant filled patio to enjoy. That is a major plus to me, especially over their other Mississauga location which is lacking in outdoor ambiance.

The food is different from other restaurant chains and offers quite a few exciting options to try. I usually go for one of their Flamkeuches as I am a sucker for any kind of pizza. I also had their summer special charcuterie plate which was totally delicious and I didn't want to share it.

Different beer pairings are a great addition to the menu, as I am not a regular beer drinker but always order one at the 3 Brewers. It just makes sense to. Their smaller beer samplers work well for me and they are priced just right."}
{"text":"We first went to 3 Brewers in Montreal - loved it. The service was great, fast, with a fun atmosphere. We tried out the newer location that opened up at East Beaver Creek in Richmond Hill and this will be our third and last visit. The service just gets worse! Extremely slow staff who try their best not to notice you trying desperately to flag them down. This after our server in two separate occasions disappeared for long periods of time and took forever to bring our simple drink orders. Our section, rather the entire establishment, was not even busy. Today, our server Pam rudely told my friend to \"hold on a minute\" (finger pointing in the air) after we noticed our order of shots were taking so long even with no one at the bar. We thought she forgot! No excuse for this level of service, we are getting our bill early and will never come back to this location."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner and drinks with friends. Recommend getting the metre of beer. It comes with a free pep and cheese flat bread!!  And you get to sample all their beers. 

Food:
Just alright. Generic bar food. Nothing too crazy that stuck out of my pick. Would probably settle for the flatbread pizzas if drinking. 


Service:
Quite busy. Had to almost wait 30 mins to get the bill. Horrible. Maybe because it was a Friday night? But hey. We were a large party eager to spend the rest of our night doing something better than waiting on a bill."}
{"text":"This place is fun.  The burgers were average as were the fries.  But the service was exceptional.  We sat by the open window just across from Dundas Square.  While it may have been a bit noisy, the experience as a whole made me want to go again."}
{"text":"This place is more suited to beer lovers than foodies. As a non-drinker, I would probably not patronize this restaurant unless invited by friends, as was the case on a recent Sunday evening.

My drink was a non-alcoholic mojito and was a satisfactory quencher. I chose the Carbonade Flamande from the menu which was a mistake. It came in a cast iron receptacle accompanied by a tablespoon and a couple of crusts of stale bread. There was barely three spoonfuls of the \"3 Brewers Specialty\" beef stew which comprised mostly carrots. It took a lot of scooping to find any beef. I couldn't locate any of the promised onions or bacon. You had to rely on a paper cone of fries suspended in a hip stainless steel coil for any real nourishment. 

The dessert was decent. A \"chocolate bomb\" had 3 components: a scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce, warm caramel syrup and a ball of mousse, caramel and cake inside a chocolate coating. 

If you could describe the service using a record turntable, set the speed to 16 RPM."}
{"text":"I just had lunch at Les 3 Brasseurs (aka. The 3 Brewers). Having worked in the Yonge/Dundas area for the last 9 years, this pub was a welcome change. I ordered the Premium Wheat Ale which I enjoyed (brewed in-house) and the JCK salad ($11.99) - comes with Marinated grilled chicken, grilled eggplant, zucchini, peppers, tomatoes and feta cheese. I was not able to finish the salad (probably because the beer filled me up) but it was delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly. It was moist and warm. The grilled veggies and their house dressing (which tasted like balsamic vinaigrette) were delicious. The salad came on a bed of mixed greens. The feta was plentiful but not very flavourful - I may ask for goat cheese on the salad next go round. Our waiter was knowledgeable and the food was delivered quickly. My lunch companion had the salmon filet with rice and veggies. The filet was a nice large size and was not over or undercooked and the veggies were crisp. Overall, this was a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times and more recently, with my boyfriend on a Friday evening. We sat on the patio and didn't have to wait. The place is fairly large with lots of seating. From the reviews, I am quite surprised how low it is...I had a decent time but maybe we were lucky?

We ordered the Traditional et cetera, since he loves beer and wanted to sample. I liked that it came in a Beer flight paddle, which I thought was cute. For food, we got the Beer-battered Maxi Fries, Caesar salad and the BBQ chicken flammekueches. I love the fries with the Dijon Mayo dip - it was the first thing I knew I wanted to order! It goes perfectly together. The BBQ Chicken flammekueches was a flatbread that looked and tasted like pizza. Overall, the food is decent and a good place to try the beers. 

The service was mediocre - nothing bad but nothing great either. 

Would I return? Yes, I would come back!"}
{"text":"1 2-star review on 3 brewers 4 poor 5ervice and food. 

I've had wonderful experiences at the 3 Brewers in the financial district with the great food and beer selection so I thought this one would be no different. 

The lack of attention from both the service and the kitchen staff is embarrassing. I understand it's busy, but when you service everybody around us and neglect us in favour of others, it's distasteful (get it?). 

Overall, would stick to other locations if you want your 3 Brewers fix."}
{"text":"Ok beer . I had better. The food is way over fried . The place tho is very cool . Hope they will dim the lights ."}
{"text":"Otherwise known as the 3 Brewers, I went to this place because I have heard from quite a few people about this place. I believe the big hoopla round this place is that they make their own beer right on the premises. They only sell their beer, and they make a blonde, wheat, dark, amber, and a red ale. My wife and I ordered beers with a twist. One was a the wheat beer with banana liqueur, and the other was the blonde ale with creme de cassis and sprite. I figured I'd try something new. I don't know if I would get that drink again, it was ok but nothing that I had much of a taste for. You could definitely taste all 3 ingredients.

By looking at the menu, you can see that there is the usual pub style foods; burgers, wraps, salads, and some odds and ends stuff. I think there may be a little bit for everyone to find something they like. I had the L'Alsacienne flamm. I would say it tastes like a thin crust pizza, and the portion is quite large. I thought the flamm was good, but not mind blowing. I was impressed with the size of the portion.

My wife had the text mex burger. Again, nothing mind blowing about the burger, but I liked the bun they had, it was not just a hamburger bun, as the top was a little more crispy and harder crust. I thought it was a nice change of pace for burgers.

There were two things here that really stood out. The first being that there was less than 10 mins from when we ordered our food to when it was served to us. The second thing I really enjoyed their home made mayonnaise. It comes with any dish with fries and I'm not one for mayo dip with fries, but this one was good. It was a mild mayo with some spices (not spicy) giving it much more flavour.

I never got a chance to check out the whole restaurant, but I think this is a good place to grab a quick bite to eat, and maybe some of the beer enthusiasts will enjoy the site brewed beer."}
{"text":"All signs point to tourist trap. I entered here with a friend out of sheer hunger, figuring that if all else failed at least I would get a good beer out of the meal. We both ordered burgers thinking they are always a safe bet - how bad could they be? We drank the seasonal chestnut ale,  good enough. Our burgers arrived, overcooked to the point of curling, with a half melted kraft cheese slice and a limp piece of bacon on top. I did not want to put this burger in my mouth. I did, and it tasted like a bad high-school cafeteria burger - not meaty in texture or flavour- but something very wrong, a pressed frozen burger. This was the worst burger I have eaten in at least 5 years."}
{"text":"NO GLUTEN FREE BEER!

Yes it's a beer place but they should have at least 1 gluten free choice! 

It's a typical car with a twist to make look different with a section that they make there own beer and you can see the stainless steel cylinders through the glass, it's a nice touch. 

I ordered a burger and fries with no bread and it does say 7oz but it looked more like 4oz! 
It might have started at 7oz but when you say on the menu it's a 7oz burger you want a 7oz burger looking at you! 

Really the best part and experience was MEGAN at the bar who came over and told me and explained all the gluten free options and she knew her stuff which was great, for that service experience I am rating it as a 3 star and possible 4. 
Overall the good is not that good and the fries were not full. And come on, the fries are one of the cheapest things that have  great profit for restaurants so just fill up the container, don't be that cheap. Your paying $13-17 for a burger and fries you should get your monies worth. 

If your a beer drinker then I guess it's a great place but that's not what most people are looking for.  

They need to step it up a notch!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and ambiance get five stars here, but the menu needs some updating as it does not offer enough to choose from, especially if you are not a meat eater.  But if you like beer there are plenty of choices."}
{"text":"Very typical pub style place. The Bartender took some time to explain the beers they make in house and tell me his recommendations. Good music was playing at a nice volume with the music videos on the screens, I LOVE it when bars do that. They had this cool beer flight that has all their beers lined up on a board and they ring a giant bell when someone orders it."}
{"text":"I'm genuinely shocked at the ratings this place is getting. Okay, I didn't come here for the beer, nor did I come here during dinner time, but the tex mex burger I had for lunch today was one of the best burgers i've ever had! The salad i substituted for the fries was also delicious without having to much dressing on it. I stole some fries from my friend and secretly wished I didn't do the substitution.  Our server looked tired, but very friendly. I actually would not mind coming back for lunch again tomorrow!

I also really like the whole ambience of the bar. The way the stairs are set up actually reminds me of the bars i've been to in Berlin. Love the feel of the place!"}
{"text":"Les 3 Brasseurs (aka L3B, The 3 Brewers) is a fun French gastropub that is steps away from Dundas Square.

I'm not sure why the other reviews are so hard towards this place.  Their beers are good (brewed on loaction), it's a nice multi-floored atmosphere, with decent food.  I had their flatbread (pretty much a pizza) when I checked the place out last week."}
{"text":"Was in town for business last week, came here with some colleagues that had been before and recommended it. After the visit, I strongly suspect their recommendations were solely based on a certain waitress. I say this because I saw the disappointment on their faces when they were told she wasn't working that night, and hearing them regale with stories of previous visits, when she was working. I don't decide where to eat based on the wait staff, so didn't quite get the appeal. The beer is very marginal, (sampled the dark, Amber, and IPA, and had pints of the latter two), and had the non descript 3 Brewers burger and fries. Nothing to text home about.

Overall, the experience reminded me of a TGIF or Applebee's in the US, but with poorer quality beer. The following night, with my colleagues elsewhere, I went to Moxie's Bar and Grill, and had much better food and Goose Island IPA, a beer made by a brewery that knows how to brew."}
{"text":"Cool spot with neat decor. Food was on the good side of OK and service was attentive."}
{"text":"cool atmosphere, and I like that they have so many sizes to their brews, so I'm not committing an entire belly to only one kind. Also love that they have beer cocktails - I tried the Monaco, which was the blonde + grenadine + sprite. Light and yummy."}
{"text":"I've been to 3B in Quebec very often and this location offers the same authentic food and incredible staff as back home! Highly recommended and the neighborhood beer is incredible!"}
{"text":"I was taken on a date here by a guy who lived in Montreal and he just wanted me to  get a taste of a French brewery. The date didn't work out, because he was a dumbass and totally missed out on a hot catch, but putting that aside I actually liked this place. 
The beer is spectacular and the atmosphere is what every good pub with good service should be like in my opinion! We didn't have any food, but my date got some peanuts with his beer. This place was packed and we decided if we want to hear each other we must take a seat by the window where there's less people.. It's very dark here. I actually had to use my cellphone's light to see the menu. Nonetheless, I'm definitely going there again just to see how it's like upstairs. If you're a beer fan, this is the place to be on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"I frequent 3Bs often. Love the atmosphere. ironically enough I don't drink beer, but I have friends who do. They all love the beer. I like the menu. Great food and atmosphere. Weekend service may be slow.
UPDATE (Jan 11): weekend service has gotten a lot better. They have a revamped menu with some awesome sandwiches and some great poutine. So far so good!"}
{"text":"I am very surprised to see Les 3 Brasseurs rated so poorly here. It seems that most of the negative reviews are related to the service. Fair enough. The place is huge and  it can get pretty busy around certain times. Despite that, I feel like it brings quite a unique and exciting concept to an area that's lacking in anything worth talking about. The beer is made in the restaurant with the brewing process exhibited behind glass. They only carry their own beer, which I find pretty good. The brown is quite hoppy and flavorful. I like the blond because it's still very aromatic but goes down easy. On the weekdays, before 3pm, if you have an excuse, half pints of the blond is quite cheap. The food is also good and moderately priced. What's more is that this place is large enough to accommodate large groups, which is why they're so busy on Friday afternoons."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I didn't get to drink their beer. I had the Moroccan salad, and it was DELICIOUS!! One of the best salads I've had in my life!"}
{"text":"Definitely a cool spot and interesting menu. Servers were very nice and plentiful. Food did not live up to the promise on the menu. Would come back if food gets better."}
{"text":"My experience here started out good, but went downhill. It had a cool vibe inside and was packed with people, which I took as a good sign. When we took a look at the drink menus, I was happy to see a good selection of wine and at good prices too (a 6 oz glass of Beringer cab was only $6.50). But that's where my good review ends.

As the night went on, we realized how loud it was inside and we had to practically shout to talk to each other - my throat was actually sore by the end of the 2.5 hours we were there! The food wasn't anything special. Most of the people at my table ordered a different kind of flammekueche so that we could all try each others. My friend's Manhattan was probably my favourite, but it probably isn't something I would order again. 

My biggest complaint was the service. Our server didn't refill our water once while we were there and we had a hard time chasing him down to order more drinks and get our bills. Also when I asked him if the molten chocolate cake was safe for my nut allergies he just said \"I don't know\" and didn't bother offering to check with the kitchen.  Well, I'm not going to bother to eat here again."}
{"text":"I had the chicken and waffles with their special fries (maxi fries?). (4/5)
It came as a burger (waffle at the top and bottom), and we were not given any syrup, but it was actually pretty good.
The meal was sweet enough and pretty savory at the same time. It wasn't the best chicken and waffle experience, but it was good.
And their special fries were crispy and tasty but not worth the $2.50 upgrade in my opinion.

What brought it down a star was the slow service. The restaurant was pretty much empty when we got there but it was still pretty slow. And there were old napkins on the floor which was not too pleasant."}
{"text":"3 Brewers though is a franchise but maybe the only Brewery Pub in the area.

Disclaimer: I was lurked in by the promise of free tasting of every single beer on tap and a neighborhood beer which is unique to each location.

Since it just opens yesterday, everything is new including all the staff. Excited and eager to please.

Great spot to come for a pint or 2. And of course some snack too!

Neighborhood Beer is Postal Farmhouse Ale (Richmond Hill)"}
{"text":"Pluses 
Great staff. Friendly. Attentive. Helpful. The beer is quite good. Dinner salad had crisp veggies with a good vinaigrette 
Minuses
Main was not great. Mussels were in a tasteless sauce and were not warm. Fries were cold"}
{"text":"Visited few days after opening day, same great experience I had previous week in Old Montreal, great food and love those home brews.  Excellent value for lunch. Definitely will be back, already 2 visits planned in the coming week.  The sausage meal was terrific and burgers our out of this world, cooked to perfection, fresh home patties.  What a great concept and place to hook up with friends."}
{"text":"Year ago, I would go after class and get a litre or two of beer during winter with a friend. The beer is cold and the atmosphere is warm. This time we had the arugula flatbread'za to pair with the post-bluejays game drinking and a flight of brews and a smaller stein of beer. The amber was sweet but spice bitter hops still there, great beer. The flatbread pizza thing was flat and just enough; sundried tomatoes paired well with arugula and goatcheese. 
A guy at the bar ordered a scotch (And seemed to not be a scotch drinker) and then complained about it. That was interesting to sit at the bar. The staff were all nice. 
The washrooms were great, but a long journey to upstairs and the opposite end of the main space. So plan ahead. Prost!"}
{"text":"I guess you really need to pair their food with beer or else it won't make sense.  Flavours were bland.  But I did like how attentive the waiter was despite it being a busy night.  I also liked how the brewery is right out in the open.  It really reminds you what kind of restaurant you're dining at."}
{"text":"Last night a group of us decided to go out for dinner.  Someone had decided ahead of time to go here and I agreed to come along.

It took us about 20 minutes to get seated (a group of 8).  Granted we did not make any reservations but the hostess kept on trying to get us seated at the bar in the meantime (while a table cleared up) despite us constantly telling her we preferred to just wait.  After a 20 minute wait, we got two back to back booths, not even a single table, but at this point we were just too hungry to care.  Earlier I mentioned the Yelp reviews about this place and at this point people were already rolling their eyes with dissatisfaction.

I made the mistake of telling the waitress I had never been to the place before and so we got a mini-lecture on the place.  Do yourselves a favour and say you've already been here.  You'll save yourself 5 minutes of your life.  I ordered a litre mug of their blonde beer and my friend ordered the amber.  The blonde wasn't very good, not much more to say about that.  I tried my friend's amber and it was slightly better so maybe go for that instead.  Most other people just ordered water and noted that their beer cocktails taste terrible from previous visits.

Like everyone else has said, the food menus were pretty average and the food selection was nothing special - your typical pub food.  I opted for the calzone flamme, simply because I kept hearing it on the radio and figured it would go pretty well with the beer.  In case you don't know, a flamme is esentially a thin crust pizza with no tomato sauce.  It's actually not bad but again, nothing special if you've had pizza in your life.

Overall, a pretty average experience.  One thing we did realize is that there was a barrel of peanuts that you could self-serve anytime.  They even have little paper bags in case you want to take some with you."}
{"text":"The food is ok, just Average. We tried their flammekueches (thin crust pizza), it's very dry. Also had Beer battered fish & chip, very dark coloured, obviously the oil has been used too many times.  out of shrimp for seafood fettuccine promised to give more oysters but there isn't any oysters in the menu and at the end no oysters at all. 
Food was served 30 min after!
Beer is so so........ 
The service is slow and no where to be found. Not very well trained staffs and manager doesn't seem to be around most of the time either."}
{"text":"I find myself craving the Blonde beer here, it's really good. The servers are friendly and aren't afraid to chat and joke with you, which makes you feel like you don't have to rush. The poutine, burgers and pulled pork are always a go to for us- comfort food at its best. Try the mac and cheese burgers for something different."}
{"text":"This is a terrible bar/restaurant to go to if you want quality food, timely service and reasonable pricing. 

In other words... the food was not that great, I got the burger and sweet potatoe fries and it was a very below average burger and the fries was a little too oily. The food came after 40 minutes and the restaurant wasn't even that busy. The server didn't come and tell us the food was taking long in fact we never saw him after we ordered the food. 

All in all, there's plenty of places to grab food or drinks near this location - avoid this place if you want a good experience."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!

They are a microbrewery so I would recommend trying their beers - specifically you can try the beer flight or a meter of beer! Ranges from pale ale to dark ale and blonde..there's quite a few to choose from. 

The food in general was alright. Food wouldn't be the highlight of the evening. The chicken quesadillas tasted decent. The 3 brewers burger tasted alright too, nothing stood out that I wanted to mention. The pizzas are pretty good though. Using a flatbread as the bottom layer, the peppery pepperoni pizza came pipping hot! The crust was thin and crunchy. 

In terms of the desserts, we tried three. The cheesecake did not taste good at all. It didn't taste like cheesecake. It tasted like hard cream. The brownies was good though, but it is fried to make it crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The apple crumble is a hit or miss with customers. I personally liked it, but my friend didn't. She thought it tasted weird because it doesn't look like your typical apple crumble. It looked more like an apple crumble pizza because apples and cinnamon were served on a flatbread. 

LAST TIP?!

If you order a meter of beer, you get a free peppery pepperoni pizza! So don't forget to ask for your free pizza if you order that meter of beer!"}
{"text":"I've been in Oakville for the last week on business. After trying a few restaurants in the area I found this place. So glad I did! The service I've had has been great and the food has been excellent. The true draw, however, is the beer. In house brewed and an amazing taste. Not much to complain about with this place. I do have a message for the management and owners of the chain. Get a damned dishwasher for your bar staff! I don't care if the tradition of the original location is like this. There's a major difference between a place that has 10 seats vs 100. Not only are you slowing down the efficiency of your bar staff and service, you're ruining these people's hands!"}
{"text":"Stuck between a 3* or a 4*. I'll stick with a 3. Even though service is exceptional here (horray), the food seems to be inconsistent. And every time I come here, i legit always get the same thing: the Pulled Pork Poutine. The first 3 times I've order this, I was drooling, it's just so good. I even shared with a friend and he really liked the way it tasted too. Ordered it a few more times after that and it just doesn't taste the same as before.. not sure why. Maybe they changed the chefs or something but I stopped getting the pulled pork here. Next to the pulled pork poutine, I get the chicken quesadilla. It's NOT bad. It's pretty average. The sour cream this time around is more fluffy in texture and it's usually the liquidly type one so it was a little hard to dip the piece in to get some sour cream.

Aside from food, I would grab a drink. Favs would be any of the sangrias. I tried the traditional with white one and it was yummy.
TBH, I'd probably still go back here as it can seat a huge party for gatherings and the drinks are reasonably priced too but next time I think i'd just stick with the generic burger and fries. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Decor is beautiful, service is ok/good, food and drinks are terrible! Waited to be seated at a table for 4 around 9pm on a Friday night - though the line went fast, the host insisted we grab a table by the door even though we could see empty booths in the better part of the restaurant by the bar. Our server was friendly and tried to make good suggestions off the menu, but it's hard to do when everything is so bland. Traditional sauerkraut was the worst I've ever had: no flavor and came accompanied with cold, undercooked potatoes. Blah."}
{"text":"ZzzZzzZ.

I don't think I've ever seen a less inspiring food menu. Absolutely nothing looked remotely intriguing. Usually there is at least one thing, if not many, that fights for my attention. As a fallback, we settled on dessert - a banana flamm with ice cream and chocolate syrup, but even that failed to inject any pizazz into my day's nourishment. The flamm part was like a Ryvita crispbread. Isn't eating Ryvita the equivalent of when Clair Huxtable decided that Cliff needed to go on a diet and fed him nothing but plain rice crackers for a week on The Cosby Show?

It's near Yonge & Dundas, so perhaps they were hoping to be inoffensive with their food selections as most of their clientele sure consists of tourist spillover from Yonge/Dundas Square."}
{"text":"Very impressed with manager and waitress. They went above and beyond our expectations. Food was good. Brews were great! Definitely would come back when in the area!"}
{"text":"Service pretty good so far @4:30 on a sunday. Not too many customers.

I ordered the speciality fish and chips and it seems like they forgot to season the fish and over salt the fries. Tartar sauce was good as well as the coleslaw but wouldnt be ordering this dish again."}
{"text":"This is a comfortable place in terms of location and restaurant space lay-out. It is located in Heartland with a wide free parking space in the plaza. They have a choice of tall booths and the average dinner table height. 

What I like most is the friendly staff who makes you feel very comfortable. They make time to engage you in a friendly conversation and get to know you. No wonder customers keep coming back. It's a place to feel good, relax, enjoy, feel safe and comfortable. Have had numerous pleasant conversations with their GM Raman and their other two managers Tevon and Andrew. They always go above and beyond to ensure that every visit is a happy and enjoyable one.

The food is great! Serving sizes are good for single or to share. They have signature dishes although it's best to ask the waitress what they have as the menu can change from time to time. 
They have beer tasting in small sizes to have a taste of the different kinds of beer they brew. They also have a tour of the brewery as the beer is freshly brewed at the location."}
{"text":"I've been here several times.  I love the beer selection.  Staff is always awesome as well. The menu options are decent although it is a smaller selection than most places. downside, is it's incredibly loud. It's tough to catch up with friends in Toronto if you can't hear them haha."}
{"text":"Overall decent environment and food. We order their flat bread, burger, kids menu, and the neighbourhood  beer. The flat bread and burger was done pretty good. House salad only came with beer  vinaigrette dressing but still good. For the beer if you don't  know what you want they can give you sampler of  what they offer which nice to try. Personally I like the neighbourhood beer and was the best deal. 

The decor was nice and staff was friendly but the overall service was a little slow.

The kids menu was a little disppointing, we got the pasta with juice and fries. Not really worth it, the pasta was so bland, I was better off with KD."}
{"text":"I've gone here a couple times when in the city, and have never had any major problems.  If you like trying different styles of beer, this can be a good place for you.  The first time I was here we had the meter of beer and a Flamm.  The beer was great, the Flamm was ok.  

The only problem I have every had has been with the wait staff.  They have been slow every time we have been here.  Not a huge issue if they were always busy, which they usually were, but I have gone when it was slower and it took just as long to get our meals and drinks."}
{"text":"Ordered a flight of beer to start off with.  The beer was good, just bummed they were out of one I really wanted to try.  

For dinner I split the Mac and cheese grilled cheese and one of their delicious thin crust pizzas.  The sandwich was so good especially the sriacha ketchup.   The pizza was a tad bit greasy but otherwise it was OK.

Very busy atmosphere for a Sunday night.  Our waitress was very good!!"}
{"text":"Popped in on a Friday with the boys. First time here. Ordered a couple apps and a main. Tried the beer. 

The sausage and onion appetizer was really good. Came with some bread. Was delicious. Easily shareable amongst 2/3 people. A little expensive @ $17 but definitely good. 

Had the pretzel as well. Really good size. So fresh; ripped apart easily. Came with 3 types of dips. Really good as well.   

For my main I got the trout. Was less than stellar. Wasn't a fan of the sauce in came bathed in; however the serving size was nice. Bigger than most places fish serving size. It also came with tomatoes; which I found weird. 

In regards to the beer. They had 5 or so types; brewed fresh in house. They actually have a brewery in the restaurant which was cool. We watched a gentleman make beer as we ate. 

Service was great too! Only downfall here was not being able to order anything besides their in house beer. I had never had their beer before; I sampled a couple (which they allow for free) before settling on the \"Blonde\". I'd compare it to Coors Lite. 

I would return."}
{"text":"I was eager to check out 3 Brewers so me and my boyfriend stopped by for dinner yesterday evening. I've been to their Oakville location and remembered their food was average-good.

We were greeted as soon as we stepped in and were seated immediately. Our server was friendly but not quite attentive. She came by too quickly to ask us how our food was when we just got it. That evening we shared 1 lb of hot wings. I got the mac and cheese sandwich with a side Caesar salad. My boyfriend ordered a pint of blonde beer and the classic burger with a side Caesar salad. Our food arrived quickly and everything was made to order. The overall rating of our orders were quite average. There was nothing that blew us away or made us feel excited to come back. My boyfriend thought the beer was okay.

After our meals we were given a loyalty card where you would get 4% off each visit. They also gave us a coupon for a free appetizer (forget which appetizer it was for).

PS: Their patio isn't up just yet."}
{"text":"Free beer samples, awesome wait staff and good food !

I'm not a fan of beer so having the option of trying it before deciding on one was a big bonus. We got to try 7 different types of beer and the sample portions were fairly decent. Our waiter was very charming and helpful. Big smile the entire night and he gave us some great recommendations. Tried the \"flamm\", it reminded me of a thin crust pizza with no marinara sauce. The pulled pork sandwich was full of BBQ flavour and was really tender.

Overall, will definitely go again to try some of the other menu items.

Note: apparently they have a lot of off menu items so try asking your server for recommendations or good deals (there was a $15 app platter and for an extra $5 you get a pitcher of beer !!)"}
{"text":"I was out on a Tuesday night with a good friend of mine and finally had the opportunity to come out to this location of the 3 Brewers. I went to the downtown location a few years ago and always wanted to come back. I'm glad that this opened up in Richmond Hill.

Everyone is going on about how cute the menu is in the form of a newspaper, but it's not going to last long without protection (:P). I only say that because the waitress herself told us that they were running low on them. She was quite nice though as she offered us different samples of beer we can try before getting our pitcher with the $20 platter special. I tried their brown and amber beers, and preferred the amber beer more as it was less bitter. We also got to try their own craft brew, called the \"Postal\", and it wasn't as good as I was hoping. Kind of tasted like a wheat ale/beer.

Anyway, like I said, there was a $20 special that also drew us here. It included any choice of beer in a pitcher and a platter of onion rings, deep fried pickles (they look like cheese sticks), cheesy potatoes, and mini rib bites with two dipping sauces. First pitcher of beer we had was the amber one, and then my friend wanted to get another pitcher of brown afterwards.

The food on the platter wasn't enough (after sharing it of course), so we ordered the calamari too. Calamari came hot, so waited after awhile, and it was worth the wait because it tasted nice, crispy and fresh. The dipping sauce it came with was  alright too (didn't get the names of the sauces).

The patio was more busier than the dining room, but I guess it was to be expected on such a lovely summer night. It was a nice atmosphere, and next time I come will definitely be in the dining room to check out their big screen tvs (and maybe try their pulled pork sandwich or a burger)."}
{"text":"It's a completely adequate gastropub. Service was friendly, there are plenty of seats at the bar, and plenty of TVs to watch the game. 

I had the blonde ale which was nothing to write home about, and a Chicken Santa Fe salad which was fairly fresh but bordered on tasteless. I'd go back in a pinch though I would probably stick to sandwiches, they looked better."}
{"text":"Oh Ontario.  What has happened to the centre of the Canadian Universe.  We are invaded by out of towners!

This 3 Brewers is located in the middle of import city.  Maybe I'm wrong but I think that Tilted Kilt is from Vegas, Moxie's is Calgary, The Keg is from Vancouver, our only lonely Ontario holdout is JACK-AStorS - and that's not much to brag about.  There is also a bunch of Asian places, some with roots back in the old country.

The 3 Brewers or Les 3 Brasseurs has origins in France.  OMG.  Can we the economic engine of Canada not create our own cool microbrew to invade other parts of our great country!?!

3B has deep roots.  Like a 100 years plus from France.  The microbrews are really good.  Award winning good.  My first 3B experience was while I was in Montreal and I really liked it...a lot!  I'm quite happy that it made it's way to the GTA.  However, I'm not sure what it is...the feel and vibe is all wrong. 

When I was in the Montreal locations, downtown or in the burb, the place was hopping with crazy energy and it didn't matter what the time it was or the day of the week.  Maybe this place didn't have it since it was over the Holidays.

The beers are good and the food is ok.  It's bar food.  Nothing too much to write home about - but good enough to Yelp about.

The place took over the former fondue place, which was also a keg before that, and I think there was another in between.  3B is well renovated and features a massive bar in the middle, lots of TVs, a multi-screen on the far wall.  Nicely decorated with their signature kettles.

It's a good date spot but my inner bar-foodie isn't going to come out of the joint singing and tap dancing.  Still return worthy but there is a lot of competition for the beer dollars in the area.

Cheers."}
{"text":"went for a bacholor party
left with a bad taste in my mouth 
our server for the evening was #18 sophie R
upon my late arrival to the party of 10 it took over 15 minutes for the waitress to come by and ask me what i wanted to drink...which she told me i was bill # 5 and wrote it down...i read over the menu, i decided i wanted two pounds of wings and a \"italian poutine\" 
when the waitress finally came back to take our order, i asked for the items i decided on, only to be told that a ingredient was missing so my poutine wouldn't be made...
so i picked a second item, to which a seperate item was missing
so i picked a third item (pulled pork) and we were good to go, or so i thought
now normally i would be pretty forgiving over bad service, if the resturant is packed...however even with the italy england game going on, they were at half cap.
i hit the bottom of my glass a grand total of three times, with the ice being completely melted everytime. 
after some time, we finally got our food, finally! the highlight of the night, the wingsd and pulled pork were actually good. no complaints 
after being done our food, seemingly took forever for our plates and glasses to be cleared. i was not drinking this evening, but everyone else was, to which they all complimented the various beers that were on hand to drink. a couple of my friends were doing shots, which our waitress gave them a free shot because she felt that her service wasn't to par...to which she spilled half the shot on my arm...
the waitress told half of the table that she was \"off\" this evening because of something...but wouldn't explain...i asked for the bills at 8:30 which got to us at 8:55 and needed to be reprinted because our waitress wrote down the notes wrong...
i chose not to tip the waitress due to the lack of service, and if your having a bad night, guess what?! the customer is not just paying for food, they are paying for a service...so work twice as hard. 
needless to say, i will never come back if i can avoid it at all costs"}
{"text":"In Toronto for work, didn't fancy eating alone and stumbled upon the 3 Brewers. The dark beers are great (hoppy but great), the music is hoppy (not great) and the staff are really busy hopping about. 
I tried the pork shank, essentially a joint/ bones with the succulent meat and fat slow cooked in beer. Once you cut away the fat the meat was tender and enjoyable, though probably not more than once. The mess of unappealing mashed potato, slightly unpleasant green beans and no onion were not a great accompaniment. Not enough to make me hopping mad but disappointing."}
{"text":"Awesome beers and really nice pub food. Definitely recommend this place. So if you are in Yonge street and walking around Dundas. Go and drink the awesome beers from The 3 Brewers. Hanging around you will get hungry. Don't worry the service is excellent!!"}
{"text":"the doorman or the manager is very rude, the bar got enough seats for two ( on valentines night) and about 20 people left behind my eyes, but he said we had to wait 45 min, I put my name down on the list and I just mentioned that we can seat at the bar if there is any seats available, he repeated himself 5 times saying that we have to wait 45 min. After 10 min I ask for a glass of water to have my medications and the doorman who acted like the manager (if he is the manager then I am really sorry for the chain) he refused to give me a glass of water and he said I was rude, I think by law the restaurant have to provide water for the customer in Ontario, I will follow after the holiday, but guys respect your dollars and do not even try this restaurant"}
{"text":"Great place for drinks, not food, i really like the atmosphere  it has lots of vibe and energy, in my opinion its a gastropub they could do much better on there menu, but i guess if your only coming here for drinks who cares !! Go for it,at least a try!!!"}
{"text":"Craft beers and Quebecois fare.  I am a bigger fan of the food than the beer.

The vibe is ok, I think it's more of a tourist trap than anything."}
{"text":"I really dislike this place. It's rare for me to have such a strong negative reaction.

I don't like the various beer cocktails. I haven't liked any of the food I've tried. It's not badly prepared or anything. I just don't like the food on the menu.

Atmosphere is nice and staff has been friendly but I've been there enough times to know that I just do not like it.

I have friends that love it, so I think this is more a personal taste thing than something the restaurant is doing wrong.

I'd be curious to see what others think of the beer cocktails. I feel like they are trying too hard and don't taste great.

It's too bad but I really did give it my all. Sorry 3 Brewers. Not my thing."}
{"text":"I have fond memories of visiting the 3 Brasseurs in Montreal.  Today, visited the Toronto location with a large group of work friends for a retirement lunch.  
I remembered that I liked the Blonde beer here these best as they make their own.  
It was still delicious and I still love it.  
And I also enjoy stating that I will \"Take a blond\".  err.. 
Anyways, the restaurant looks nice, and like the comments below, open concept, multi-floored rustic Escher style layout.  
The waitress was nice, and immediately starting taking our names down and matching our orders to names so she wouldn't get confused. (large group)  It was nice, since she called me by name the entire time (without looking at her notes).  
I ordered a Brasseur burger which is basically a bacon cheeseburger.  Bun was a little dry and burger was ever so slightly overcooked, but it was still a tasty burger and it hit the spot well.  
Big question - would I return?  Sure.  I wouldn't drive out of my way or anything, but it was a solid meal with a solid beer, and I like the look of the place.  
I had no complaints.  Service was fairly good seeing as we were around 20 people.  
So... good job 3 Brasseurs."}
{"text":"Had one of the best flat breads ever
It was so thin, and so light and not to mention very flavorful
Our server, Vivian, was very courteous and most importantly, very attentive and prompt.
The place has a different ambience
Nice place to be at"}
{"text":"A misdt the chaos at yonge and dundas, trying to get away from the crowds that attacked streets for Nuit Blanche, I found myself in the closet resto.

There was a bit of a line up that night (expected) but we somehow only waited maybe 10 minutes for a table.

Our gracious server showed us to our table, It took me a few minutes to realize that the menus were already on the table, They are called The Gazette and look like news papers!

They have a great selection of beers brewed on site. However I needed all my strength that night to fight through the growing crowds outside so I had to pass on the alcohol.

The menu consists on typical pub fare, open faced sandwiches, and there specialty the \"flammequeche\", or Flamm for short - an Alsatian-style open-faced pie served with varied toppings aka super thin crust pizza.

I was sold on that and got the Three Cheese Mozzarella - gruyère and cheddar cheese topped with smoked ham. It was reallly good!! Very flavourful, super thin crust almost like a tortilla with crispy edges and flavourful toppings!

The have a good dessert selection ranging from sweet \"flammequeche\", creme brulee, cakes, and pies.

I opted for the Chocolate Moussee and a Cappuccino. The Cappuccino was pretty good and came with a little sugar cube and Chocolate Moussee was really good too, crowned with whipped topping and chocolate sauce, it was nice a thick, and a good chocolatey flavour.

FYI the washrooms are a trek upstairs, none on the mainfloor however on your trek upstairs there is a barrel of peanuts on the stairs, so make a pit stop and fill up your compliamentary bag.

Overall great friendly and prompt service, yummy \"flammequeche\", freshly brewed beers on site, and free peanuts!"}
