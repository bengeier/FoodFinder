{"text":"My hubby and I came here for dinner on a week day. There was one waiter serving 4 -5 tables. Fortunately, we had reservation and got seated right away. The atmosphere is relaxing with eclectic decor. We enjoyed the service here. 

We had brussel sprouts and chrizo for the appetizer, which was quite nice. For mains, I ordered the braised rabbit which came with steamed vegetables and rice. I had a taste of piri piri cornish hen. Both was nicely cooked. However, they both seemed to be quite standard, with little in the way of wow factor."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!  I officially have a new favourite drink spot in the city.  The bartender William was amazing (and cute!!) and made some of the best tasting (and best LOOKING!!) drinks I've ever had.  The rest of the staff was also really friendly and it's reasonably priced.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the West end."}
{"text":"Quinta's menu is on the small side but they've got quite a few daily features so make sure you check their chalkboard before ordering. I won't be able to comment on the authenticity of the food since my Portuguese experiences don't extend beyond Portuguese custard tarts...but I'll definitely be able to comment on their taste factor! So, here goes...

Octopus Salad - braised octopus, mini red potatoes, smoked paprika vinaigrette and yellow beans ($14). Tender pieces of octopus. Loved the combination of the chunky potatoes and crunchy yellow beans. The dressing had a nice kick. I loved every component of this salad.

Duck Confit Wings - piri piri and served with pickles ($12). Tender pieces of meat and a wonderfully crisp skin. Very messy (definitely not first-date friendly). 

Pork & Clams - crispy pork belly, little neck clams, veggies, cooked in a seafood broth ($20). 5 large clams and 5 pieces of thick-cut pork belly with a crispy skin. Nice broth. The only part of the dish I didn't love was the diced veggies which didn't add very much to the dish in my opinion.

Seafood Cataplana - selection of seafood gently cooked in a white wine tomato broth (market price). Price varies day to day depending on the ingredients. Ours was $25. The portion was very generous and the shrimp, clams, fish, octopus were perfectly cooked.

Flourless Chocolate Mousse Cake ($8). It was sweet, rich and smooth. I recommend having it with an Americano.

An enjoyable meal!"}
{"text":"Here with my bestie for dinner and truly loved our experience. It begins with friendly, informed and attentive service from our waitress. Then an engaged conversation with the owner/chef. This is one of my new favorite spots in Toronto."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided on Quinta for our three year anniversary dinner.
We went on a Tuesday which clearly wasn't their busiest night but the quality of everything was exceptional.  For starters, we had the Charcuterie. We were offered more bread halfway through which I thought  we wouldn't need......let's just say we practically licked the platter clean. 

After much contemplation, I decided on the Bitoque & Dan had a pork chop, (his a special for the night). His dish came with kale which was made to perfection. I don't eat strip loin often but when I do, I expect it to be fantastic. It was. The egg was made to perfection and the potato chips that were made in house were delicious. 

Our server suggested the Biologia monastrell tempranillo wine to pair with my meal and what a great suggestion it was.....fantastic. 

For dessert, we shared the poached pear in custard with goat cheese. Melted in our mouths. 

To sum up: the decor was simple, rustic & cozy, the service was excellent and the food worth talking about. 

I wouldn't think twice about going here again, even with a large group of people. 

Not bad for a restaurant that has only been open five months."}
{"text":"My first time there and we had brunch. Waited our 30 minutes to receive our brunch with no notice from the wait staff. The rosti, a simple dish to make, was like hickory sticks, over cooked and cold. Salad was flavourless. Homefries were also cold. My charcuterie sandwich was dry and somewhat bland. The bread was grocery store quality. No excuse for this considering all the great bakeries in the area.  Some of the worst homemade hot sauce I've ever had. I should have made my own breakfast and saved the $40."}
{"text":"Always the friendliest service, great food, great atmosphere, AND they take brunch reservations!"}
{"text":"This place is so underrated. We go for brunch on the weekends and it's always half empty, which blows my mind. They have really awesome inventive dishes. I had the rabbit eggs Benny once, amazing. The Lox dish they have is awesome too. Also spaghetti squash eggs Benny. Cool decor, waitresses are super sweet and always remember us, and the chef seems like he cares. He'll come out and ask us how we enjoyed out meal 9 times out of ten. I almost don't wanna encourage ppl to go here just so it can be our secret spot. But they're so nice they deserve all the business they get and deserve more. AND they usually are playing The Band and old school good tunes."}
{"text":"4.5 stars We had an excellent meal here and based on the reviews, I believe that the only poor reviews happen when the diners don't like the food type they ordered. This would be a five star rating if the appetizers were not in counts of 3... this is annoying when you have 2 people. I know that's minor, but it is a negative issue. Would it kill the budget to add one more piece?

We enjoyed the chacuterie small plate, though it was actually just pate and figs on a piece of bruscetta. We also had the chorizo corn dogs that were tasty and not doughy-heavy with a nice spicy kick to the sausage.

For mains, my husband had the rabbit and loved it, though he felt the portion was a bit light.. I had the filet, ordered medium rare. When it came out raw, it was immediately pleasantly returned to the kitchen, where they not only prepared it perfectly but replated my entire meal with all the sides fresh and hot. EXCELLENT SERVICE!

Service was quick and friendly and the chef came out to apologize about the steak. This is a great place for dinner, warm and welcoming and wee recommend it!"}
{"text":"Looking up the menu and reviews beforehand, I was INCREDIBLY stoked to check this place out, and even happier when I discovered Quinta was participating in Winterlicious: $25/pp for dinner.

My date and I were maybe 15 minutes early for our reservations at 7:30 but were accommodated immediately. Cute atmosphere, but a very open dining room made us feel a little exposed. Luckily, the restaurant soon started filling up to the point where only a handful of tables were left. Doubles seating along the length of the restaurant is very tight; out of respect for the diners immediately next to you, I think this is what keeps overall noise levels down.

Our server sold up the sides of the day and beer, but we were craving a little vino for date night and considered getting a bottle (okay, maybe craving a lot of vino!). The modest wine menu consisted of about 8-10 wines; the server could barely describe the difference between two varieties and admitted needing to refer to his notes cause it had been so long since tasting either... and left it at that. While pulling your notes out during service is unprofessional, I can certainly appreciate the effort to be helpful and informative. Instead, he just left with \"I'm not sure\". Ummmm?!? It also didn't help that he was standing behind my date and kept switching sides, making for a really difficult exchange. 

Nevertheless, food came rather quickly:
-  PARNSIP AND POTATO SOUP: pureed parsnip & potato with a drizzle of paprika oil and roasted kale. highlight was smokiness of the kale, yum!
- PORK TERRINE: teensy little dollops of terrine served with toasts, mustard and pickles. nuttiness of the terrine was nice, as was the pickles.

- FRIED PIRI PIRI CORNISH HEN: a cut of breast + wing with spaetzle and kale. the skin was super flavorful (my date found it too salty), though flavour and moisture was lacking in the meat - really wished they used dark meat instead. cornmeal in the spaetzle went unnoticed.
- BITOQUE: steak cooked rare to our liking, on a bed of fried potato coins and a fried egg ontop. pictures looked like the egg would be over fried, but the yolk was nice and runny. though my date also found the fries too salty, the diners next to us were enthused enough to order a side of fries on its own. potato + steak + egg: you can't go wrong. yummy combo but for such a simple dish, I'm glad it didn't have the original $25 price tag on it.

- PANNA COTTA: with spiced apples ontop. panna cotta was over gelled but perfectly not-too-sweet on its own. For me, the apples tipped the scales to oversweet.
- FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE: super dense cake atop a schmear of lemony cream. lemon + chocolate isn't my number 1 combo but it did help to cut a bit of the richness. chocolate was nice and dark, not too sweet.

Sorry Quinta - the 2 stars describe my experience perfectly: MEH."}
{"text":"Good, good.

Came with a friend one evening, and we had the charcuterie board, rabbit leg, tuna loin, and cheese plate. Charcuterie board was excellent, especially the duck (liver?) mousse, which we shared with jealous restraint. The mains were good, and the homemade chips that came with the rabbit particularly surprised me. They also know their cheeses, and we both enjoyed the cheese plate very much. Prices aren't cheap, but are reasonable ($20-25/MP for entrees).

Service is helpful, decor is woody and a little bit rustic. Alcohol is surprisingly not that expensive; a (small) glass of port is only $6.

Food vs price: 3.75/5
Service and ambience: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"This is a MUST for all Toronto foodies! You will not be disappointed! Locally sourced food with exceptional local and Portuguese flavours. The unique combination of ingredients and flavours fill a desire true foodies crave. This is a real gem. I had the rabbit, which I couldn't believe how much I loved. I didn't even know I liked rabbit. It had the most amazing brazing that gave it a wonderful flavour and the meat was soooo juicy. The rabbit came with homemade potato chips that were both soft and crunchy-the best I''ve ever eaten. Just writing this is making me crave more! The restaurant is designed to perfection with lots of room to breath between tables. Bring your whole family or plan a romantic night. This does it all! I hear the weekend brunch is a real speciality! I can't wait to go back and introduce more friends. I know they will be thanking me for sharing this new restaurant with them!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to brunch spot: the food is delicious, there are no lines, and the service is friendly. The menu isn't huge but it's really well-chosen, and there are a number of vegetarian options. Also, I really can't argue with a side salad of kale & arugula. 

Go with the savoury French toast, if they're offering it as a special. It is Life Changingly Delicious."}
{"text":"Jaysus there are a lot of birthdays in August and this one happened to be a foodie who has very attuned taste buds.  So I searched high and low to find a unique dining experience and stumbled upon Quinta.

Chef Leor Zimerman, though trained in classic French cuisine is reaching out to the Iberian Peninsula for inspiration.  This cuisine encompasses influences from the Roman, Arab, Jewish and African cultures.

The word Quinta means farmhouse or villa as the rustic, country décor suggests.  

The food is definitely homey without feeling like you're in no man's land with dishes such as the wonderful Charcuterie board (with Raisin Mostarda, Duck Rilette, Liver Parfait, Olives, Crostini, Pumpkin Seed & Cranberry Terrine and Chorizo).  I absolutely loved the mostarda and liver parfait as a combo. Yummy!

For my main I ordered the Roasted Leg of Rabbit served with garlic broccolini and chorizo rice.  The rabbit had a nice crispy skin to it but it was quite a lot of work to get to the meat.  I think a steak knife would've come in handy here!  The chorizo rice was flavorful without being greasy and the broccolini was also very tasty.

The birthday boy opted for the Bitoque (steak topped with a fried egg with housemade potato \"chips\" and some olives).  I thought the olives were a bit misplaced as they didn't really add to the dish.  The egg was fried perfectly, with a nice crust and runny yolk and the steak was juicy, tender, succulent and we were both still talking about it the day after.  It was really really good!  The potato \"chips\" was also top notch - and trust me, you won't miss the ketchup!

For dessert we opted for the Cookies and Cream.  This comes with 3 cookies and a side of strawberries and cream for your dipping delight.  The cookies tonight were: Classic Chocolate Chip, Cranberry Lemon Zest and Ginger Snap.  My favourite was the Ginger Snap. 

But the pièce de resistance would have to be the Flourless Chocolate Cake.  Imagine eating an Aero, where it just melts in your mouth - now multiply that feeling by 10.  This was a very rich cake, but the blueberries did a good job at toning down the \"heaviness\" of the cake.

I really recommend Quinta.  Chef Zimerman likes to be among the people as he personally tops up your water and even acts as your server as he presents his dishes with pride.  While the restaurant is located in what I would dub \"Little Portugal\" I'm glad that there is a unique restaurant that isn't another churrasco or bakery in the hood."}
{"text":"Very reasonable price - especially the wine selection.  
However, the food was decent but was not memorable."}
{"text":"Good service...good food...incredibly knowledgable server....forgot to tip her more because of the Groupon...if you're reading this...ill get you next time!"}
{"text":"Yum. Seriously. Yum. Run, don't walk to Quinta and try everything on the menu.

I love the way they are updating classic Portuguese dishes with French precision for modern diners. The clam and pork dish was a great combo of flavours and textures.
Don't forget to try the daily specials or the cocktails. 

Prices are very reasonable. The drinks are all around $10, which is cheaper than average now. Food runs in the teens and low 20s.

The service is good. Management and staff are really nice and friendly. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was a very fine meal, well served. A superb tray of cold meats and garnishes, for three of us fine pork and clams, cornish hen, tuna, excellent desserts. A terrific bargain for a prix fixe of $30.  And as a bonus a pleasant chat withe chef-owner."}
{"text":"This restaurant was surprisingly awesome.  I really did not know what to expect and looking at the menu I did not feel like I had many options.  That being said, once arriving with my girlfriend we were warmly welcomed and treated very well.  Quinta had many specials to choose from in addition to the standard menu.  We ordered the octopus appetizer (my first time eating octopus) and it was surprisingly tasty. For the main course I selected the Venison, which was slightly sweet (to my surprise) but delicious once paired with wine.  The dessert was the most disappointing part of the meal, cheesecake sandwiches, overall however a very good experience.  I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounded up to 4 for excellent service. The staff were extremely friendly and funny too. We felt very welcomed in the restaurant. 
Had the frog legs watercress appetizer - the frog legs were meh (like the chinese way of cooking it more and it had a strange after taste) but the salad dressing was very nice. 
For mains we had the sea bass, the clam and pork belly, and the cornish hen. The sea bass was the full fish which surprised us. Very nicely done tho. The clams were delicious as well as the pork belly. The cornish hen was really juicy. 

Overall a solid place"}
{"text":"The food taste is not bad, but they were out of two main courses when the menu is already small. 

We waited for 50 mins before the first food came. When we asked if we can get some bread first at the 40mins mark, the server just brought us some crushed nuts...

The chef came to apologize after, but did not feel he was really sorry about it. The food portion is on a smaller side as well."}
{"text":"Catching up with a friend last night at Quinta

The service was good and happy it was crowded. Hopefully service will be equally great when it does get busy. 

We had little fish for starters. It was delicious, not greasy, the greens that came with it were complementing it very nicely. I prefer this over the fried snacks at Hoof Raw bar, those were just way too greasy compared t this.

 The lobster kale salad was yummy. The peaches that came with the salad could be better. I don't know how, it was plated nicely, just it wasn't ripe enough? or it could use a bit of light dressing to tie into it more so? 

Dessert, cookie plate - skip it. Cholocate cake was better, but not a must. I wish spent more on decor or at least drywall the ceiling. If it weren't for the dim lighting, I might have walked out on this place. 

Enjoyable, but it doesn't make me want to go back right away."}
{"text":"I went back for brunch! Great spot and nice to not have to worry about lines. The space was also nice because one of my DC's was bringing along a 2 year old and they were very accommodating. They have highchairs and our server brought paper for the kid to draw on. 
They have lots of specials, but we had to try the brunch platter for 2. For $45 you get poached eggs, pork belly, chorizo, crayfish (!), rosti potatoes, a tossed kale salad, AND 2 mimosas. A very filling and tasty brunch and a nice change from your usual brunch offerings. We also sampled their omelette special - chorizo, kale, and cheese which was delicious and came with roasted potatoes. Another DC had the salmon eggs benny. The yolk was nice and runny as it should be. 
The chef himself came out and went around to tables to see how we liked the food, which was a nice, personal touch. 
I'm adding this to my rotation of 1) special treat brunch spots and 2) places to take out of town guests/bigger groups (one of the few places to take brunch reservations, but if you arrive before noon you shouldn't need one)."}
{"text":"I went last night for dinner with some friends and we were treated like absolute royalty. 

Right now they have a ridiculous deal where it's 1 appetizer, 2 mains, 1 dessert and 2 glasses of sparkling wine for $50. WHAT A DEAL! DEAL OF THE CENTURY. 

Quinta's menu is small but all of the food on the menu is carefully curated by their chef/owner.  

Between us we got to try a bit of everything on the menu. I loved my main which was Portuguese style steak with an egg and chips (one tip, ask for it more well done then you usually get it and it should be perfect). Other stand outs were the beet tartare (yes beet done with tartare flavours) a well selected cheese board. and an absolutely to die for flour less chocolate mouse/cake. 

Quinta also has a really well stocked bar and some excellent cocktails which are as tasty as their names are quirky such as the Bad Santa and the Turtleneck. Aside from the excellent meal deal they also have drink specials during the week. 

Quinta is perfect for a date night or even a large group of people. The ambiance is perfect and this place ought to be rammed every night."}
{"text":"I couldn't figure out why this place was so empty when I walked in... and after my meal, I still can't figure it out! The food and coffee were great, good music (Black Crowes was playing when I walked in and they also put on the Psychedelic Furs!).

I also like a small menu... it means that every time I go back, I try something different. Big menus are overwhelming and I always eat the same thing.

I had the potato rosti - fried grated potatoes, cream cheese and lox, topped with arugula and yummy dressing!

So go on - fill that place up, yo!"}
{"text":"Service, great. Drinks, good selection. Food, excellent. EXCELLENT. 
They have a basic menu with rotating specials. Been here a few times already and tried a lot of their food. Everything I've tasted has been amazing....from the Little Fishes (oh please bring it back!) to the chicken to the pork belly & clams to their own version of fried rice...

If you want to eat really well with great service, don't skip this place.
It's sad to see this place empty when so many crappy restaurants in the area are being filled."}
