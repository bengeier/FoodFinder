{"text":"Don't go to this restaurant. I had just bought a group 2 weeks ago (expires in May). Drove halfaway across the city to check it out, only to be denied my group on arrival. There reason was not valid. 'Oh yeah um we just have some problems with group ons so we don't take it anymore'. Yet, its still being sold! Isaid at the very least you need to honor the original value of the group on. She said i needed to talk to group on. I asked if they had indeed cancelled this deal with group on it self but she had said oh we left a message with them but group on hasn't contacted us. Its likely that they realised they were losing out money promoting with group on and cancelled without actual cause. Pretty shady for a company. Like i said, at the very minimal, they should have offered the minimal value in which i paid for the voucher. I should not have go and cancel my group on and recourse because of their neligiance. Considering group on isn't even aware of them not accepting them!"}
{"text":"Owner very friendly and good service! Had a great pho satay beef soup, good portion, broth was tasty, noodles and beef were fresh. Will return!"}
{"text":"Tried this place because it was close to home.. The pho was just average. Nothing special"}
{"text":"Just really good food.  The place is not super fancy but the owner's hospitality makes up for that.  Very friendly and FAST too!  We eat here often and it's always consistent.  Love the simplicity of this great place to eat."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pho with extra meat but if this was extra I would hate to see the regular amount.  It was supposed to be pork and beef but weren't told until pickup that they ran out of pork and substituted chicken, but I didn't see either in the order.  It used to be good but will find alternative to order from.  Very dissappoined."}
{"text":"The ingredients were fresh (white meat in the Pho!) and the fried spring rolls were wonderful. Nice and clean and all the food was so so tasty. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious pho!   Number 47 is good according to my roommate.   I highly recommend this place."}
