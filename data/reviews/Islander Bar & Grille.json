{"text":"The Islander Bar and Grill is *that* place where you go with the intentions of having a few cocktails and a burger for happy hour, but the next thing you know, its 2:00 am and you're the Dancing Queen.  Guaranteed good time.  

The Islander has excellent food.  The burgers, sandwiches and even the salads -- they are all wonderful.  They have top notch cooks and quality food.  The beer selection is excellent as well.  The bartenders are always pleasant and do a great job of serving even when they are crazy busy.   

Rumor has it that the owner, Chad,  is the original Blue Power Ranger.  I have yet to confirm, but if you're in the neighborhood, stop in and get a photo and while you're at it, grab a burger and a beer. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had to pick at least one star to start a review but honestly this bar deserves NO STARS !! You go to a bar to have fun relax and forget your problems for a little bit but if you are in a place where the bartenders are unfriendly, to the point of being rude ...HELLO? Get a new job !!!  Why would I spend my money at a place that makes me angry to even be there?  Nope, nope, nope !!   Heads up JOEY... you are a cold unfriendly bitch!!!  Find a new fucking job cuz you suck at what you're doing now !"}
{"text":"Cant believe there's not a review here yet. Visiting from Dallas an still the same after all these years. Very local crowd, but good people. Cheap drinks, great Philly, pool tables but uuugh drop the country from the jukebox."}
{"text":"My wife & I go to this place 2-3 times a week for either lunch or cocktails after work.

We enjoy it immensely !

Friendly owner,Chad
Great Cook,Jeff
Nicest & best looking bartender in town,Joee

Can't recommend this place enough !!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with my girlfriend.  It's basically one of the same copy-and-paste bar and grills you'll find in Strongsville (Panini's, Bilo's, Cleets, etc.).  Not that there's anything wrong with that... it just has no personality or character.  The food is normal and the service is normal... nothing impressive but nothing offensive.  A good place to go with co-workers, either for a workday lunch or a beer after work."}
{"text":"Have been going to this bar for many years glad to see it's getting crowded again like back in the day.... food is decent and most of the bartenders now how to pour a decent drink we always have a good time and the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"Terrible customer  services  overall. Took twenty minutes for anyone to even come and take our order, and then well over an hour for the food to arrive. Sat at the table with no refills on drinks, and was ignored when  I went to  the bar to get refills. Food was okay, but customer service ruined the entire  experience."}
{"text":"This place is so over rated. I don't know how this place manages to stay so packed on the weekends, but somehow it does. There's a nice sized bar, pool tables, food, music and people, but somehow it doesn't come together for me. Maybe it's the fact that it's the same people that go here all the time, I don't know. Or the fact that everyone there can be a little closed off and the ones who are friendly, you wish they weren't. Can we say 'creepy old(er) men?' Anyway, there are undoubtedly better options in the area."}
{"text":"We decided to give the Islander a go as we were in the mood for some bar food and saw a Groupon for it.The decor was inviting and fresh, if a tad dimly lit. Our waitress was kind, personable and attentive, even though she was tending bar as well. The chef/runner who delivered our food seemed genuinely interested in whether we enjoyed it/had everything we needed.

However, the best thing about the Islander Bar and Grill was the food. Easily some of the best bar food I've ever had, we tried the chicken tenders (appetizer), spinach and artichoke dip (appetizer), cheeseburger with bacon and a seafood flatbread. The tenders were HUGE and perfectly breaded and fried, the spinach and artichoke dip was tasty and well-proportioned. My wife's burger was excellent even without condiments, the beef was juicy and the bun seared to perfection. The bacon was really thick and tasty, I'd definitely recommend adding bacon to your burger. The seafood flatbread was also very good, with plenty of shrimp, scallops and lobster meat topping a well-seasoned, cheesy crust. The only thing we weren't impressed by was the tortilla chips that came with the spinach dip. A minor complaint, for sure.

Altogether, we both agreed we would absolutely come back to the Islander with or without a groupon in the future. 5/5"}
{"text":"The Islander is for goons. Place has strong dousing of social primitive disease that we can  safely identify and quarantine. It's called Parma, like Mersa or something. This is a man's bar and I agree with my friend Shannon's review that creeps are all over the place. Summer months too so your seat post near bar sink is suddenly fruit fly oasis, gahh. I venture like I am on an episode of Survivor or Fear Factor. 

If I can provide a visual of the place in absence of photo I would post the napoleon complex man standing at the bar cursing the Keno board with the vodka tonic. If Yelp could take animated GIFs one could simulate how bad his delirium tremens. Ouch that is somewhat hurtful review..I will have to gift the bartenders mystic tan sessions  for this post. Islander gets deuces."}
{"text":"Terrible bartender that was an a$$ to me and argued with me about applying cash to a bill and said it was not possible once the tab was paid however I never asked for them to run it. Long story short watch what you tip them because I chose $0 and they added themselves a $22 tip anyways. I will never be going there again and I do not recommend anyone else ever go there either. Drinks are way overpriced and customer service is terrible. His exact words when I said he will not get a tip was \"I don't give a shit\". Now it is clear why he did not care because they just add it after you leave."}
{"text":"Came here for the burger. I heard it was awesome. Since I wasn't a local,  I got some really crappy ass drinks and attitude. I watched the lady next to me getting full glasses of kettle one,  while I got a shot of bottom shelf vodka in a tall glass of water.

The burger was sub par. You spend all this time advertising \"hand made patties\", and then serve it on some garbage ass bread that I can only imagine you found in a dumpster behind walmart. Guess I should be thankful for the glass of vodka water (minus the vodka) that I got with my meal."}
{"text":"I'm not a picky eater but the food is dry and tastes just okay. The fact that I was really hungry before I got my food makes me wonder if the food was actually alright. The bartender was very nice though even though she had to serve like 15-20 people at the restaurant by herself."}
{"text":"Pretty below average.  Service started ok and plummeted from there.  Luckily another server (or bar back) stepped up.  So, what was wrong....no mayo on BLT, buffalo chicken was not breaded as specified on menu, no blue cheese on buffalo chicken (again, on menu), refills on kids drinks not done and waited for beer for a long time.

Food was blah.  I guess a place to drink, at least that is my interruption.  Pretty simple stuff they could not get right, sure it happens more often than not.

Plus a bit pricey for bar food!  Better food, service and value is out here."}
{"text":"Nice place  clean. Nice bar. Drinks good and reasonable. Good food. U have to try. Lots of tvs"}
{"text":"Great food and good place to watch the game!  One of my favs!  Very friendly staff will make you feel like this is your own version of Cheers. Weekly specials are great value as well."}
{"text":"This neighborhood bar has the best wait staff around. One bartender can take care of the whole place and still be on top of everything. They have a very good selection of bar food and the portion sizes are large. What I like is that they with make adjustments to your order. They aim to please. Their seafood quesadilla is outstanding and stuffed full of seafood. The sauce they put on top is zesty and sooo......good. The place may not be fancy (a little old and dark) but the food is good and the staff is friendly. They have  1/2 appetizers at happy hour."}
{"text":"Poor service during the week stopped for something to eat and the bar was to busy taking care of regulars to stop and ask what I would like to eat. patron dropping f bombs constantly. First beer was served in a chipped glass. Weekends during the day I always had good service. Stay away during the week."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends and I'm truly disappointed in the service here.  When we first came in we were excited because they were playing great music that we could dance to. We never got approached to get our drink orders nor did we get great service.  We waited a good 20 minutes before we even got noticed.  When we got here we went to the bar and we saw that there was a bar back guy not really doing anything but looking at his phone.  I asked him a question about their food and he totally ignored me.  The guy that was sitting next to me even did a nervous laugh because he even noticed how rude this employee was. 

In addition, my husband just told me his experience and how the dark hair'd bartender looked at him directly in the eye and he tried to order from her but ignored him and went to someone else to take their order.  He was waiting for 40 minutes to order some drinks and was being patient like he usually is, which is truly upsetting.  A blonde bartender than noticed the situation and took my husband's drink order. 

So if you want to get crappy service and disappointing food, feel free to come here and waste your money.  My group and I are truly disappointed with this first time experience here.  I'm starting to think that you have to be intoxicated here to actually have a good experience."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a bunch of colleagues on a Friday night and I was wondering why I never came here earlier. The place is extremely reasonably priced and the service is pretty decent."}
{"text":"This is right in my neighborhood. It's a place that always feels comfortable when you get there. They have fantastic bar fare for food and a great beer selection including many craft beers. It's always crowded in the evenings, especially on weekends which shows they are doing something right. They also have a music trivia night on Thursday nights, I believe. Only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is the parking can be a little difficult on a busy night, but just park in the next plaza and walk your ass over! You will burn off the calories you are bound to consume when you arrive! Has that neighborhood bar feeing which is always nice."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with some friends who live in the area. It's always pretty fantastic! Came by Saturday for an early drink with friends...turned into an all-night throwback dance party. Loved it. 

As a side note: I have to say that the Middleburg Heights police are Canada-level polite... Or maybe that's just the way things are done in the suburbs...There was an insanely drunk Eastern European guy (\"Vlad\", as we came to know him) who had to be removed from the Islander after getting into a fight with a taxi driver. He was pretty befuddled, and it was pretty interesting to watch the cops try to figure out his name (he didn't know it), where he lived (nope) or whether he was married (he's single....YES!) for over a half hour, with the most delicate of kid gloves. It was kind of sweet, actually."}
