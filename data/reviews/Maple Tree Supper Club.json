{"text":"I go here about once a month and have only had problems with a couple meals.  My fav is their Prime Rib.  However I have had other things too.  The BBQ Ribs are great, broasted chicken is the best in the area, and breakfast is good too.  The salad bar has a large number of things to choose from including two kinds of homemade soup.  This is a real Supper Club."}
{"text":"Awesome meal! My steak was best ever!! Soup was homemade!! Dede!!! Amazing waitress!!!"}
{"text":"Wednesday nights the special at the Maple Tree is an all you can eat buffet.  Salad fixings, two soups and a hot buffet with shrimp, broasted chicken, ribs, mac and cheese, mashed, gravy and a couple other dishes.  Yes, the buffet is somewhat \"minimal,\" but the salad fixings are fresh, the croutons are delish and the dressings are really really good.  Soups are home made and tasty. The roll of bread is freshly baked.  The servers work really hard to keep everything fresh and filled.  Oh, and this is probably the best chicken I have tasted.  Nothing fancy.  Just well prepared, hot and tasty.  

The atmosphere is old-time Wisconsin Supper Club.  Friendly folks, good conversation and well worth the drive to McFarland."}
{"text":"I only ever come here for the Friday Fish Fry. The lake perch is amazing!!! The tartar sauce is so good and the fish always comes out piping hot cooked perfectly.  All entrees come with a choice of side as well as an unlimited soup/salad bar included. 

Come before 5pm or you will be on a wait... (on Friday that is. I don't know about the other days). 

The salad bar isn't anything amazing. The lettuce they use is a bit meh. The soups are always very tasty.

Servers are all very nice and friendly, as well as the hosts. The atmosphere is very laid back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, unbeatable service... We'll be going back again soon!  We enjoyed the broasted chicken and cod the most, though the lake perch was good too.  Cheesy hashbrowns, a salad bar with soups... All delicious.  What more could you ask for??!?  We received very friendly and prompt service even though the place was packed.  This is a rarity.  A MUST GO TO place within 10 min of Madison.  With so many fish fries disappointing as of late, this has a good possibility of becoming our new #1.  (We need to go a few more times before I honor it with that label!)"}
{"text":"The fish fry here is absolutely delicious! They recently started to offer beer battered fish fry and it has even more flavor to it making it even more irresistible. The salad bar that comes with is very good as well. The croutons for the salad literally melt in your mouth and the salad ingredients are fresh! I have to say my favorite salad bar soup from here is their potato soup for sure!

The bartenders are very friendly and are willing to actually speak to you as they get your order and joke around with you. The wait staff are also amazing, the waitress I had every time I've gone there remembers my boyfriend and I and we go only about once a month! 

Also, although packed, the wait time is always short and it has great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer:   I'm from California and this was my first supper club experience. I'm also a picky eater and don't like unhealthy \"comfort\" food. 

I wasn't sure what to expect but my relatives talked the place up. The food was okay but the ambiance of the place (or lack of) would probably prevent me from coming back again if I was in town. The salad bar was pretty disappointing, but I guess I'm spoiled coming from California. I expect every salad bar to look like the Whole Foods Salad Bar. Besides some lettuce and one type of cut vegetables, there weren't really any other things you could add to your salad besides croutons and dressing. 

We came on fish fry Friday so to eat in the spirit of the place I ordered the cod. Went for the poached instead of fried. it was good but two pieces was way too much for one person. Good if you want to take some fish home though."}
{"text":"Have came to this place several times over the years because we like to support the local places. Have seen a steady decline in quality of food but last night was the worst. We were there for a birthday party. My mom and I ordered petite prime rib. Both came out luke warm. Another person in party ordered rib eye medium rare. Came out first time completely uncooked...raw. He asked to have it sent back. New one came back...raw. Not even edible due to cook on it. At this point HE asked to take it off the bill. No manager suggested it, no waitress brought it up. No one offered anything else instead of it. The waitresses excuse was, well the meat was kind of thick. He left only with a slow to serve drink and a baked potato. I continue to understand why Toby's Supper Club just down the road receives 4 to 5 stars..they have figured out what Maple Tree has not."}
{"text":"Incredible value!! very good food great portions,also very busy mostly older crowd still don't understand that...Salad bar smallish but very very tasty,comes with your mael as well as fresh bread...nice bar as well"}
{"text":"What a dump! On our first visit our service was OK until another patron took off her shoe and cleaned her toe nails with a knife and fork at the table. The server didn't see a problem with this. The food on that visit was bland and tasteless. Unfortunately there was a second visit. I had no choice but to meet a friend there. The service was OK but somewhat lackluster and my food arrived raw. I sent it back and got a burned plate of food. At 45 years old I was, by far, the youngest person in the place. I think that Maple Tree saw its best days many, many years ago...."}
{"text":"The buffet was minimal , considering it was $12.99 per person. The taste was nothing spectacular. Fried Chicken, fried shrimp,  macaroni and cheese with some kind of sausage, cheesy hashbrowns, mashed potatoes and gravy. The salad bar was nice and fresh."}
{"text":"Loved the salad bar and soup. Drinks were great. I got the beer battered cod. I would go back but get a different kind of fish because it was pretty salty."}
{"text":"Reviewing as we go-

Arrival:
Took a long time (20 mins or so) to be acknowledged... and had to ask someone if they knew we were here...

Drinks: 
Coffee wasn't half bad and was plentiful- coming in a carafe, but she brought my kid the wrong juice....

Food ordering:  
11am sunday- out of waffles? Little disappointed. Really friendly service, if a little over stretched on Sunday mornings.  

Food: Here's what I learned today.   Where the front of the house might be a tad over stretched... the Food is excellent.  The eggs were cooked just right and the hashbrowns came crisp.  Both were in need of a tad of seasoning, but the cook on them was one of the best I've had in madison.  The toast and prime rib were excellent as well.  Everything tasted fresh and really very good.  

Desert:
Carmel apple pie ala mode- little over sweet, but good and exactly what I expected"}
{"text":"Our supper club tried the Maple Tree this past Wednesday. There were six of us. We were seated promptly and our waitress was friendly and attentive. We ordered drinks which were both well-made and reasonably priced. Our waitress brought us multiple rounds of bread and butter as needed. The bread was warm, fresh, and extremely tasty.

Although most of our group ordered steaks and seafood, I decided to do the Wednesday all you can eat buffet. There was a chili and a cordon blue soup which was rich, creamy, and delicious. The salad bar is small. Iceberg lettuce, cucumbers, hard-boiled egg, cherry tomatoes, chickpeas, ground meat, a couple of cold composed salads and several salad dressings including a creamy blue cheese which I enjoyed. It also had spreadable cheese and crackers which has always been my supper club salad bar favorite. I was very glad to see it there as I'm disappointed when I don't.

The buffet included breaded shrimp, ribs, fried chicken, mac & cheese, a cheesy pasta dish w/ground meat, potatoes and gravy, potato wedges and chocolate chip cookies for dessert. The chicken was amazing. The meat was moist and whatever was in the coating was mouth-watering. I definitely thought I tasted honey. I could eat an entire plate of that chicken. Yum!

Everyone else enjoyed their meals as well. I thought the service was great, the food tasty and the prices reasonable. I would not hesitate to return here."}
{"text":"Work had a breakfast buffet there for employees. Service was great. The food was not good. Good coffee and the space was nice. But I would personally not host there due to the food. Eggs were dry, everything's my was just...old. I'm pulling for local business but not if this is how they're serving it. I feel like the owner is just deliberately cheating up the food to maximize profit and not really trying much at all."}
{"text":"I love the Maple Tree. Especially their perch. Every time I am home, the whole family ends up eating there. Usually there is about 12 of us, and the Maple Tree always accommodates us. I love their wait staff, and did I mention their perch? Classic supper club experience. Love em"}
{"text":"I've been dreaming about prime rib for a week or more. I'd been to the Maple Tree with my wife for breakfast 8 years ago or so and it was fine; I could do better at home, I figured. However, the wife and kids were away today and I decided to give the Maple Tree a try for a solo dinner. Arrived at 6pm, the wait was 20 minutes. I hung out at the bar catching fragments of conversations along with people watching and realized this is a mighty supper club of Wisconsin lore and matches my memories of glorious places from my past. I got a seat  in a small booth after 20 minutes and quickly ordered the largest prime rib on the menu and a brandy old fashioned sour. The waitress told me I had a go at the salad and soup bar so I filled a plate with iceberg lettuce and the standard fare along with a mushroom hamburger soup. The salad was great; on point, fresh and exactly as I expected. The soup with the homemade croutons placed in the bowl before filling was terrific and made me question if I should sneak back for another cup. I didn't and waited for my entree. The prime rib showed up soon after finishing the soup and salad and the size of the cut was astonishing. You can see what I'm saying from the photo I added. It was great. I ate half. (I recommend a side of au jus and creamy horseradish for this dish.) The steak was terrific. It met, or actually surpassed, my expectations. It was done as requested and lightly seasoned. A few shakes of the salt and pepper shaker made it perfect along with the au jus and horseradish. I recommend you get this. As a Wisconsinite with a few supper clubs meals under my belt, I was satisfied. The old fashioned was perfect, as was the second. Next time I'll take my crew with so my kids can get their first taste of a true Wisconsin supper club. This ain't L'Etoile, but it earned five stars for being a five star supper club meal that satisfied my supper club expectations."}
{"text":"The service was good, but our chicken and fish fry combo was not.  The chicken did not have much flavor and the fish did not stand out to me.  We did enjoy the bread they provided.  We liked the spread cheese and the homemade croutons in the salad bar, but would like to see more veggies and mixed greens.

I am generally complementary when it comes to food reviews.  I'd like to give them another chance but I'm not in a hurry to spend my money there.  The place was packed and I suspect well known as a source of fish fries."}
{"text":"This is the best supper club I have been to in a long time. I always look forward to their fish fry every Friday. I'm not a big fan of fish. In fact I will only eat maples trees fish. The service is great. The atmosphere is awesome. The bartenders know their stuff. You can't go wrong with a dinner from the maple tree!"}
{"text":"My dining partner said the ladies room was okay,but I found the men's room to be filthy. Disgusting. Flies. Can't talk about much else when that's what comes to mind about this place."}
{"text":"Been there many times for their great prime rib  and salad bar. Our waitress DeeDee was right on top of everything. Food ,drink all excellent.The bartenders and owners make sure your experience is the best. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Supperclubbin at it's finest! Great service. Decent salad bar. Bread starter....so good. Highly recommend the lake perch. Place was busy even for a Monday night.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant,just had the best steak and my wife had ribs. Salad bar and soups included in price, Miriam & David Harris"}
{"text":"have eaten here regularly for years.  it has been declining for some time, tonight being the worst. the prime rib was so dry it looked like a 3 day old pork chop, and to top it off the service was terrible. when asked upon paying how dinner was, and giving an honest, yet respectful answer, the reply was \"must be a bad rib.\" Never going back."}
{"text":"When we walked in we were told it would be a 15 minute wait...eventhough as we looked around there were atleast 5 tables completely open, cleaned off, ready for people to sit there.

The server was very nice, friendly and answered questions. The food was ok. It wasn't exceptional and it wasn't worth the price. All in all, it was ok and if I had a million dollars to spend and didn't feel like cooking my own spagetti, I'd eat here, otherwise, I'll make the basics as home for much cheeper."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out recently.  It was very busy and looks like an established business.  But we have learned that just because a place is busy doesn't mean that all those people have good taste.  It could mean something else entirely.  I think the crowd was mainly because this is a place where a lot of the locals gather for drink and conversation.  
From the outside this restaurant looks a little fancy but inside it is very casual.  I think this works well for them as people feel comfortable to come here as they are and be able to order a variety of very nice entrees.  
The bar is nice and big, the sort of bar I like to see in restaurants like this.  Plenty of room.  The dining room is set up like a large dining hall with tables that allow them to create seating for whatever group shows up.  This can be a real positive for large groups.  They could put together a bunch of tables real fast and have you seated quickly.  But the atmosphere is very plain and dull.  
Our table had a loaf of white bread on it with butter packets.  It was good tasting but pretty basic.  I would have liked a more dense and homemade-like loaf.
The menu was moderately priced.  I would say a little high for the atmosphere but some of the meals are a deal.  I got the fried cod which was cheap.  This came with choice of potato and salad bar.
I also ordered a mixed drink which was well made and priced a dollar less than I expected.  The coffee was inexpensive too.
The salad bar is just the basics which was disappointing.  But it was fresh.  It was almost impossible to get to the ingredients in the middle of the service tray.  Thankfully I have contortionist training from time I spent in the circus so I was able to wind my arm down under, up and then down to reach the eggs.  Just at that time a server arrived and started to fill the selection next to where I was reaching which challenged my skills even further.
Our waitress was pleasant and efficient.
The food was warm, not hot and the breading on the fish was soggy, not crisp as I expected.  The fish itself was cooked perfectly and was moist.  But overall our food could have been much better.
We were satisfied with our meal and quite full.  The bill was 30 dollars for two which included my cocktail.  So very cheap.  
So there are some positives and I can see why people may come here but it is nothing fancy and for some of the pricier meals I would be much happier eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"When you are in the mood for a classic Wisconsin Supper Club dinner this should be on your list to check out. Friday nights are packed, but what do you expect on Fish Fry Friday? The restaurant takes you back in time, you can tell things have not been updated for years. Don't let that fool you this place is a diamond in the rough (or hidden gem?).

I took my family of 4 here for dinner a week ago. We arrived around 6:30 pm and were told we would have about a 45 minute wait. Since we had our two children with us sitting at the bar was not an option, plus it was packed there were no open seats. As I ordered 2 beers and 2 kiddie cocktails (a special treat for the kids) we noticed a high top table was open. We snagged it right away. Surprisingly the wait time was no where close to 45 minutes, it was 20 maybe 30 minutes at most. Score! 

Once we got to our table our waitress took our drink order and told us she would have fresh bread out to our table shortly. Oh my heavens. This loaf of bread was soooo delicious. It is not your typical roll, this is seriously a freshly made warm soft loaf of bread. It was so good in fact we had two before we even got our food. I could live on this bread alone...

The highlight of the salad bar was the freshly made soup and croutons (yes freshly made buttery croutons). The salad was your basic iceberg lettuce, which is fine for a supper club. That night they had Fish Chowder... Yeah I wasn't sure what to think either but it was delicious. 

The dinner portion sizes are very generous, we both ordered the 1/4 broasted chicken and cod dinner. We should have just split it. If you are ordering from the kids menu, SKIP the mac n cheese. Its Kraft, and honestly wasn't good at all. It was dry. For $6, that was disappointing. On the other hand my son loved his hamburger that was cooked to his liking (medium). 

Overall we were very happy with our meal, and plan to return!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have only ever been here on a Friday night. We love their lightly battered cod (if you order the normal beer battered it is GIGANTIC). This old school supper club hasn't aged, nor the decor, or the locals that frequent this fun establishment. The fish fry includes salad bar which is always stocked and two different delicious soups are always available (no repeated flavors since we've been there). My husband and I LOVE their homemade croutons! Every meal is served with a fresh warm loaf of bread to start; the tiny loafs are delicious!! The bar is oval shaped and almost always full with regulars bellied up. We always go home with leftovers, which are also good reheated. Please go here and step back in time. The owner is a great guy who we met on our most recent trip."}
{"text":"Brunch is busy but doesn't mean good ... very much buffet style flavors which means not that great .. it just didn't hit the spot for a simple fast breakfast."}
{"text":"Four stars for the drinks!!!  Love the big oval bar here that has super comfy arm pads that help you belly up!  Huge and cheap martinis, they make a great old fashioned, and the ice cream drinks are so so good!  Food is supper club style...meh."}
{"text":"This isn't fancy food, but it's 100% Wisconsin. 

One Friday night my boyfriend and I both independently suggested this place (neither of us remembering the name nor having been but coincidentally having it in mind) so we decided it was fate and we should go.

Being a Friday (aka Wisconsin fish fry holy day) we decided to head over around 8 PM in hopes of avoiding the crush of people. We checked in with the host stand and were told it'd still be a bit of a wait, 20 minutes. Twenty minutes on a Friday is no problem at all. We were able to grab seats at the bar and my boyfriend ordered an old fashioned. I saw a delicious looking creamy pink drink across the bar, but just as my BF's drink was placed in front of him our buzzer went off so I didn't get a chance to ask what it was. All told we probably waited a little over five minutes for our table. Not bad!

Once seated we had some time to peruse the menu - the dining room was still hoppin' so it took a bit for our server to get to us. I ordered the broasted 1/2 chicken with white meat and hash browns; my boyfriend got the three-piece fried cod and cheesy hash browns. The server sent us on our way to the soup and salad bar.

The salad bar is exactly how you remember it from your childhood - iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, shredded cheese, bacon bits, and big vats of dressing with those tan ladles that have the fat, semi-cursive writing on the handles letting you know the crucial difference between ranch and bleu cheese. They also have packets of dressing up top if that's more your speed. I told you at the beginning this wasn't fancy. 

There are two soups to choose from. We had the option of chicken noodle and french onion. Don't sleep on the croutons. They're house made and some of the best I've had. I opted for the french onion soup and it seemed to be made from scratch. The croutons soaked up the broth perfectly. So good.

When we returned from the salad bar the server dropped off a mini loaf of bread. It was warm and soft and obviously the source of the croutons. I only had one slice since I went ham on the croutons in my soup, but my boyfriend devoured it and I heard the table behind us request a box just for their bread - they couldn't bear to leave it behind. 

When our entrees arrived we both realized we could have opted for the smaller offerings of our meals. I ended up with two huge breasts and wings, and my boyfriend's cod filets were probably 3x6 inches each. The hash browns were very generous. Needless to say, we both went home with leftovers. 

The chicken itself was some of the best broasted/fried chicken I've ever had. The coating was super crispy but didn't form the impenetrable shell you sometimes get on broasted chicken, and there was a ton of meat on the bone. I generally am extremely picky about eating bone-in chicken and leave half of it on the plate because I get grossed out but this was an amazing exception. The meat was juicy and plentiful. 

Despite being full I decided I wanted to truly embrace the supper club experience and the nostalgia for my childhood and ordered a grasshopper. A towering glass of minty, chocolatey ice cream goodness came out and it was perfect. With its large portion size I was afraid to see how much it added to the bill, but it was only $6. I was expecting $9-12. I think that is probably what sealed the deal for me. 

If you didn't grow up in Wisconsin and want to get a sense of what makes us the way we are, head to Maple Tree."}
{"text":"It's a supper club. Please keep that in mind when reading (or writing) other reviews.

We went for brunch. It was packed. We got a table quickly. They had buffet only. The choices were very limited but good. The strawberries were enormous.  There were home fries and hash browns, but the hash browns ran out and soon they only had home fries. The scrambled eggs were flavorless (cooked with very little oil) and there was only one meat choice which was ham. An old fashioned was tasty. There were no eggs Benedict or Belgian waffles as advertised on their website.

Brunch was only 6.99, which was fair for what you got. I would have a more expensive brunch with more selection, but it was just what the many patrons wanted."}

{"text":"Hadn't been here for years.Hubby went for a birthday party came home raving about the brosted chicken so we thought check it out.the decor is straight out of the 70s but the food was excellent. I Tried the chicken it was excellent juicy. And crispy hubby went with fried shrimp 6 large split prawns said it was very good except he said the the cocktail sauce was bland. Oldest got bacon cheeseburger and fries other son got mac and cheese kids meals nothing special but he ate it all daughter got the kids tenders i had a bite very good .Hubby and mine came with salad bar nothing fancy but enough options to satisfy including 2 homemade soup  and homemade Croutons meal also includes loaf of fresh bread. Service fast and friendly brought more bread when she saw the kid's getting antsy reasonably priced we'll be back"}
{"text":"Well isn't this a surprising little spot! If wood paneling, mallard art, and a salad bar with non-salad items (processed cheese food? Oh, Wisconsin, you silly place!) is your sort of thing - then you need to go to this spot!

This really is a supper club that has not changed at all (including most of the clientele) and that makes it so much better. They don't try to pretend to be anything they are not. 

Drinks are strong and inexpensive. You get a loaf of bread served piping hot (mind you the whole loaf could be rolled up to a marble-sized ball similar to Wonderbread) right away and most meals included soup/salad bar. The salad bar had fresh tomatoes and cucumbers as well as other ingredients such as chick peas and beets. The croutons are homemade which is a huge plus in my book! The soup was also surprisingly good. The chicken noodle was very rich and classic tasting. 

I definitely recommend that you get the special of the day and you will get a great meal. This is one of the last places I know of where you can still get poached fish (drawn butter anyone??) or fried. Their deep fried walleye was huge (the price was a little more than surrounding fish fry's) but worth it as it was delicious! 

This is not a health food spot. This restaurant definitely reflects a different era when it comes to what  a meal should be. So go here, indulge, and hope the Maple Tree never changes!"}
{"text":"Best supper club in a long time.  Waaaay better than Watertower Chophouse.  Friendly staff, fresh bread at table, small salad bar with 2 soup choices.  To die for homemade croutons.  And some of the best prime rib I have had in a long time.  Also better priced.  Watertower Chophouse has 14 foot salad bar with only 1 soup choice.  And no fresh bread.  Would recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"Went there New Years Eve.  Prime rib was 1/3 fat!
Decided to try rib eye last night.   Ordered medium rare and it was served basically uncooked pink.  Cooked me a new steak and it came same way!!  Couldnt eat!  2 other in party ordered prime rib, they came to table luke warm.  Needless to say will never be back there.   Recommended staying away!   Plenty other restaurants in the area that want your business."}
{"text":"This is just a nice little turn back time supper club. The salad bar is small but well stocked with fresh food (no brown lettuce or withered grape tomatoes here). Always have a choice of two soups. And the home made croutons. Wow. Wonder if they aren't made from the day old bread served at the beginning of each meal. Delicious!!

We usually get the fish or the broasted chicken. And it never disappoints. Both come out crispy and flavorful but not greasy. 

The staff here are very nice as well. We always leave full and without having broken the bank. Happy this place is still around."}
