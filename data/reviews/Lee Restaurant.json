{"text":"If I go back to Lee, I would only order the slaw again. The decor and ambiance in the main dining area are  Asian-inspired, as expected but also appears somewhat dated. 

1) Singaporean-style slaw

We ordered Chef Susur's famous signature dish, the Singaporean-style slaw ($20) and added tuna sashimi ($10). This slaw was very good. There are so many ingredients but they work well together and it was refreshing and light. 

The tuna sashimi was smoked on the outside and it didn't really add any flavour so I would probably skip that. The tuna does add a contrasting texture to the crunchy slaw. I arrived hungry and felt full after eating half of this dish.

Note: there are peanuts. 

2) Peking & Char Sui Duck ($29): Beijing duck garnish, steamed pancake, foie gras pâté

This is not the same as what you would expect from a traditional Chinese restaurant style Peking duck. I didn't enjoy this very much. 

3) Warm Molten Chocolate Cake ($12): caramelized jackfruit & banana, vanilla bean ice cream

Nothing unique about this dessert but it was delicious anyway."}
{"text":"Glorified Mandarin. Totally not worth the money. Take any Asian restaurant, pile 
the food high, put some fresh herbs on top and you have Lee"}
{"text":"Really good experience here. I dined with 20 people and they were attentive to each of our needs - waiter was really knowledgable and knew all the ingredients in each dish and was able to make really good suggestions for our group. 

Loved the slaw.  I have cravings for this dish all the time now. Best thing on the menu! I also had the lobster ravioli and had a bite of the black cod. Also very good!

Even though it was a busy night, at no time did we feel rushed by waitstaff."}
{"text":"In my many years of living in Toronto I've probably been to over 50 restaurants. I would easily place this one in the top ten. The food is great. My family and I ordered the slaw to start and the cod, braised beef and lobster ravioli for entrees. The portion sizes are a bit small so be prepared for that. I liked the braised beef and cod the most. Service was incredible. Really loved the sangria which was made and served at the table."}
{"text":"I always order too much every time I'm here.  Since moving away from Toronto, I make sure I eat at Lee whenever I go back to visit.

I could have the Slaw for every meal until the day I die, and I will die a very happy person.  The cod is very good, also.

On a more expensive side, but if you go with 2-3 more people, you can all share!"}
{"text":"We only had a couple of dishes they were both excellent . We started with the grilled octopus and then we finished withe the curry chicken! While we very much enjoyed the octopus the chicken was amazing!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. The coleslaw and green curry chicken are worth revisiting alone."}
{"text":"Went here for a special last dinner with my girlfriends before I got married this summer. It was probably the most memorable dining experience I've had in a long time!

The plates are more sharing plates, although I think you could definitely share a small plate and get one to yourself. We just ordered a bunch of things (with help from our excellent server) and shared them all. Note also they have a GF menu (one of my friends is strictly GF) which is mostly selections from the regular menu with perhaps a few tweaks here and there. 

Watermelon and feta salad was very tasty but probably my least favourite dish. It's a fairly uninspiring combo you see in many restaurants these days but certainly the flavours are delicious and it was a nice refreshing option.

Black cod was the most perfectly cooked piece of fish I've had. It was so moist and sat atop a turnip cake that was crisp yet creamy. Definitely a must order.

Top Chef Green Curry chicken is another must order, we were blown away by the presentation, the smells, and finally the taste. It was spicy yet cool and big pieces of chicken rather than the smaller curries you get in most asian restaurants.

Finally the Singaporean Slaw, completely lived up to the hype. We almost ordered 2, our server talked us out of it but I think in the end we all regretted not having more. What a symphony of textures and flavours (I know how annoying that sounds but it's true). I wish I could eat it everyday. Tangy, sour, bitter, sweet, salty, all played a role.

Regret not trying the cheeseburger spring rolls. Next time.

I met Susur once at Reposado on Ossington. Such a nice guy and we even shared a tequila shot. I'm now officially a huge fan. Guess I've got to head over to Bent soon!"}
{"text":"Well this was the third time back because of the the other experience we've had here and it is a favorite for my wife. It was our 12th anniversary and I was hoping for a spectacular dinner because that means the rest of the night goes well if you know what I mean - pornhub and an ammonia filled tentacle can only take a man so far and sooner or later that said man needs the real thing. 

So never, never, never, never, ever put toppings on fresh oysters! Oysters are natures art and don't require anyone adding to it. When you add that oil it coats the sea brine - oil and salt don't mix in this case.

Becareful with the signature slaw. It seemed off compared to last time. Perhaps some of the ingediates sat out too long. the taste was great but the textures weren't as crisp as last time when the  taste matched with the texture. the cold and warmer elements make this dish impossible to beat. 

The scallops were perfectly cooked but be careful of the top layer - maybe diffuse it out so that when they are cut the knife can break through instead of push down and squish the scallop below. You also may want to add saffron was or some other spice to the puréed squash to provide a kick since it seemed bland. 

The highlight of the night was the tuna slices. They were perfectly dressed and yet still allowed natures art to be tasted. Excellent dish!!!

Wine selection was great and as always a reasonably priced SB was our choice.

Service was top of the line and no issues here.

Sadly my wife was disappointed which meant that I was disappointed later on that night. So given that I only get out once in a while with her it's hard to risk another dinner here in the next couple years. 

Yet it was likely an off night for the restaurant and I still would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Lee has the best Asian-fusion food in Toronto. These days, DaiLo seems to get more press for its Asian-fusion than Lee, but that's unwarranted -- in comparison to Lee's flavourful dishes, those of Dailo's are bland and lack delicacy. 

This time, I got 5 dishes, which I all loved -- quite a pleasant surprise, since I am pretty picky. 

The slaw: of course, you can't go to Lee and not get this. This signature dish mixes the textures of 25(?) vegetables to create a delicious salad. You'll want to have this every day. 

Scallops: So delicious. The dish presents a variety of tangy flavours that contrast the maple bacon pieces on top of the scallops. Yum. 

Cod: Cooked perfectly, it is incredibly soft. The sauce is great, too. 

Peking & Char sui duck: Amazing! You make your own wraps with all the ingredients provided. As with other dishes, it is flavourful (when you put everything in). Such a delight. 

And last but certainly not least, the molten chocolate cake: Just get it. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Toronto for our anniversary and made reservations at Lee Restaurant to try out Susur Lee's cookery, after learning of him on Top Chef Masters.

It was a fun experience.  The space and decor was an industrial/arty/modern mix.  The services was very friendly and professional.  They were very informative and helpful with suggestions.  The dishes are meant to be shared and are smallish in size, similar to tapas.  I personally really enjoyed this, it allowed me to sample several dishes.  Dishes come out as they are ready, so there is no particular order.

We ordered the following:
- Singaporean style slaw - came recommended by our server, has great texture with thin fried taro strips, peanuts and crispy noodles.  the sauce was a sweet and sour plum sauce.  has 19 ingredients, also costs $19 CAD.  a very popular dish and serves as a quick starter.  fun little dish if it's your first time at Lee.

- Duck confit roll - rich and tender duck in a pasta shell.  I recommend it.

- Rack of lamb - came with a deconstructed curry sauce.  I highly recommend it.  Best part for my husband was the fried banana, he enjoyed it so much that we asked for more for dessert, served with vanilla ice cream.

- Caramelized black cod - generally good.  My husband enjoyed it.  However, I felt that although all elements were very good, I didn't enjoy the soft/mushy texture of the turnip cake against the cod.

- Pork lion - we selected this off of the special menu of dishes Susur served on Top Chef Masters.  well prepared, but a bit boring after having the other dishes.  i would suggest sticking to the regular menu.

We really enjoyed it and would recommend it."}
{"text":"Lee is a must-visit restaurant for fans of Asian fusion in Toronto. The ambience is very nice, after 7 p.m. it was quite packed so I'd recommend making reservations if you plan on going during peak time. It's a great place for sharing and service was very good- and fast!

We started off with the shoestring potatoes, singapore slaw, and calamari with fried zuchinnis (this was a special so I don't think you can order it now). All arrived promptly and were still hot (in the salad's case, cold). The shoestring potatoes were pleasant but nothing special in my opinion, I'm not a big fan of mayonnaise so that may be why. The singapore slaw was fantastic. It is a signature dish, and deservedly so. It is the best salad I have ever had and I would go back for that dish alone. With tuna sashimi, I suspect that would be an excellent light dinner for two at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend the slaw. The calamari and fried zuchinnis was perfectly done- calamari is always a crowd-pleaser and it wasn't anything out of the ordinary calamari, albeit quite fresh and well fried. The fried zuchinnis we ordered as the Milos special is a favourite in my family and we wanted to see how Lee's compared. Milos takes the cake (it is their special, after all) but the zuchinnis were excellent nevertheless.

On to main courses, we ordered the top chef green curry chicken and my younger siblings tried the cheeseburger spring rolls. I love green curry chicken and had high expectations for the top chef dish. I was a little let down, as it was nothing spectacular. It was very tasty, but definitely not a life-changing green curry chicken! I didn't have a chance to try the spring rolls but my siblings loved them and they are very picky eaters. Take that as you may.

Our dessert was a nightly special so I won't bother reviewing it but it was delicious and unique. Susur Lee's skills at combining flavours shines through every dish at this restaurant. His modern take on Asian cuisine is fresh and straightforward. I thoroughly enjoyed my first time at Lee and will return again. The mixed drinks are also great, I tried the basil mint lemonade and it was very refreshing. The sake menu is extensive and the waiter was very helpful in recommending one. All in all, Lee offers an excellent dining experience and if you are considering it I would wholeheartedly recommend!"}
{"text":"My all time favourite restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"I had some reservations about Lee, as I had dined at his two previous restaurants in the space and had been unimpressed, but allegedly this new outing was more focused on his strengths. 


Wine: I ordered a Riesling, which was decent, but it was presented to my dining partner for viewing and tasting.  I might have noticed that I ordered the 08 and she delivered an 07 (which was listed on another page of the menu) that was more expensive.  When I pointed out that she brought the wrong bottle, she said there was only one in the system.  (?)  We were charged for the more expensive bottle until we pressed that it be fixed. 

The \"amazing\" singapore slaw was sweet and had a nice texture, but was uninteresting in the end, with no spice or depth of flavor.  

The \"chow mein lettuce wraps\" were delivered without the chicken ordered and were about what you'd expect from PF Chang.  

The onion fritters were fine.

The Chicken Curry was presented somewhat interestingly, but the chicken was fried and the curry sauce was tasty but there was a severe lack of quantity of sauce. 

The rack-of-lamb was good, done nice and rare.  

Service was slow and and there were annoying gaps in the meal.  Drinks were obnoxiously expensive.   Presentation was very good.  The food was meh. At the prices charged, definitely NOT recommended.  I've heard that when Susar is there, they're on their game, I guess he wasn't there when we were..."}
{"text":"If you want to try unique, amazing, one of a kind food, go here!
Pricey for sure, so great for occasions or a special date. The service was top notch. Even though it's a classy joint, it doesn't feel pretentious. 

We had a prix fixe of 9 items, we tried the slaw, the ribs, lettuce wraps, and a bunch of other dished. All of them were a big hit on our table of 11.

I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Went to Lee's for a work function, so my comments are specifically related to the food, service and atmosphere, while I won't comment on cost. We had the 6 course tasting menu that was served with an amuse bouche to start and included the famous slaw salad, fish, octopus, chicken, lamb and a trio of desserts. 
Firstly, the service is top notch. The balance is perfect between keeping it upmarket, without letting first timers feel uninformed or out of place. Even the sommelier was great at giving a balanced set of options and explanation of pairings. 
Secondly, presentation. You know you are in a top notch restaurant when they don't overwork the presentation at every opportunity, but rather give a visually stunning dish fit for impressing a date or marking a celebration. 
And then the food. The dishes were exquisite, with excellent variety and bold flavours. I feel like some of the sides were hit or miss and did not always stand up to brilliantly executed focus of each dish (the \"potato salad\" was sufficiently underwhelming to draw comments of disappointment from the table). 
Best meal of my life? Probably not, but it is pretty damn close and you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Lee is my go-to restaurant at home in Toronto.  Good food, cocktails and cool ambience."}
{"text":"One of our favourites in the city. 

This place is consistently great. We've been here several times and have thoroughly enjoyed each meal. It's a wonderful restaurant to go to with friends so that you can order a bunch of dishes and share. 

Service here is always impeccable - even on a crowded, busy Saturday night - and the space is gorgeous (though they are changing it - can't see why, it's lovely). 

I don't think there has been one bad dish we have ordered. Standouts for me include:

- The slaw (it's always the highlight of the night so we order two when we go in a large group).
- Goat tart (though maybe a bit small).
- Cheeseburger lettuce wraps (amazing - I think about them a lot).
-  Green curry. 
- Peking Char Sui Duck (my absolute favourite dish - small pancakes with foie gras and stuffed with other deliciousness).

It's an upscale restaurant so it's expensive. Maybe go when you have a special event. It's well worth the cost. We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Good and interesting food but overpriced and small portions. It's dark and very loud. A place to show off, not to enjoy good company."}
{"text":"I think I have been here over a dozen times since I moved to Toronto 5 years ago and I have never been disappointed.  The service is amazing, the vibe is awesome, the food is so delicious that I close my eyes to savour it. I could eat the Singapore-style slaw everyday, and the caramelized black cod just melts in your mouth.  Other faves: spicy crisp tofu, braised beef, ceviche, garlic shrimp.  I wish the matchstick potatoes were still on the menu (hint - please bring them back!).  It can get pricey but I've almost always gone with a group of around 10 and we have ordered several dishes to share so it is a lot less $$ than if you are only 2-3 people, and then you get to try everything! My favourite restaurant in Toronto.  Best day was when Susur Lee was walking around the dining area and suggested that I sprinkle some lemon on my cod - obviously he was right and it was even more delish."}
{"text":"Fabulous food.Great casual ambience.Amazing decor.Asain-fusion.
What more would you want 

Try there 18 ingredient singapore slaw.It has 18 ingredients which are all listed and mixed on the table.Has the perfect balance of flavours that put it all perfectly together.
BEST salad in town!!Defiantly,lee is my Favourite restaurant.

Go there once and you will get withdrawals again and again."}
{"text":"Really good food with beautiful presentation.  The service was pretty good. We ordered a few different tapas and by far the slaw is the best we had. It's absolutely gorgeous and made with an unbelievable amount/type of ingredients.  This is a definite must to order here.  The mushroom tart was very good too. The other items we ordered were good but not to die for. I do recommend this place as the items were all very fresh."}
{"text":"Made a visit to Lee Lounge and found that things are both familiar yet alien. The \"Restaurant\" sign still hangs above the door and the light feature that dominates the restaurant is still glows comfortingly from the far wall. But the entire feel and atmosphere of the place has changed: pulsing music, low sofas, and a bar to loiter at on the side. Where Susur was white and light, Lee Lounge is all black-lacquer and \"exotic\". If you're seeking the Susur of old, look elsewhere - only echoes remain.

We got the \"Susur's Favourites\" Pedestal (geared for 2 people), allowing for a well-priced cross-section of the menu currently available at Lee Lounge. I had a hit of nostalgia when it arrived: it's served on the trays that Susur used for his desserts and mignardises way back when. Back to the present, we found most of the tray okay, with a couple of standouts.

Whipped Chickpea Dip
Served with homemade garlic potato chips, the chickpea dip was a generous portion. I found the dip nice enough, but the chips were very brown and I didn't think this was a strong dish.

Salmon Ceviche
Mouthfuls of layered texture and spice. A really lovely combination of flavours: vinegary, spicy, smoky, and a bit of sweet from the black beans. We liked this so much we ordered this to re-run after we had gone through the pedestal. Served as 2 on the pedestal and 4 a-la-carte.

Peking Duck Rolls (with foie gras mousse)
This was my second pick for best-of-the-night. The skin inside was crunchy and melded well with the mousse. I didn't detect the taste of foie gras, but duck and hoisin are very strong in the first place, so I'm not surprised.

Hunan Chicken Wings
Sticky and sweet, with a minor chili spice kick, I thought these were kinda normal.

Cheeseburger Spring Rolls
They serve this a lot at the food fairs, and I recall thinking it quite good when I tried it over the summer. Somehow, the smaller form-factor hasn't done it much good. The filling was mushy and indistinct, and I missed the greens that helped brighten the roll up. Not sure how they'd fix this, but I think it definitely needs some tweaking.

The tower would normally include edamame (steamed in lotus leaf & mustard salt), but they had run out that night and we had beans instead. We also ordered one more dish in addition to a re-run of the salmon ceviche.

Chinese Doughnut Fritters
We wanted a little more and opted on this selection from the menu. Served in a dim-sum basket, these are crunchy bites of shrimp-filled fried bread. Tasty and plentiful, for two, it was way too much, but in a group of 4-6 it would be perfect.  Very snack-worthy.

Lee Lounge is meant to cater to those who are looking for small nibbles with sweet and tropical cocktails and to people heading out to the nearby clubs, post-meal. I think that he's managed to create something that suits that crowd really well.

But I pine for what Susur once was and hope to see Chef Lee establish its next iteration."}
{"text":"I just ate lunch here with 2 other people an hour ago.   The bill for 3 people came to $100.  

What we got:
-ice water (yup no drinks)
-2 appetizers: the slaw was yummy but the chickpea fritters were just ok.  The orders came 30 minutes apart.
-3 mains: 2 black cod burgers and one salad.  The black cod burger was greasy and bland and easily mistaken for something frozen from Loblaws, and the fries were dry.  Apparently the salad main was good.

To top it off the service was terrible (very slow and somewhat passive aggressive).

If this was $50 I'd give this 3-4 stars.  But for $100??  Pass!"}
{"text":"I went to Lee for a family celebration, and really enjoyed my evening out. I last ate here years ago, and had found the service pretentious, but would give the service 5/5 for my most recent visit.

We ordered:
- Chickpea & okra sweet onion fritter
- Watermelon salad
- Singaporean-style slaw with salmon sashimi
- Spice crusted diver scallop
- Top Chef green curry chicken
- Thai satay
- Slow braised beef
- Marinated Korean style AAA strip loin
- French and Chinese Tong Yuen
- Warm Molten Chocolate Cake
- Daily special: pear tart with crumbled wasabi

The highlights included the onion fritter (both sweet and salty, not soggy), Singaporean-style slaw (loved the presentation that our server gave us, reciting all 19 ingredients as he mixed the crispy noodles in), the complicated diver scallops (so many textures and flavours that worked well together - like the smear of butternut squash), the green curry chicken and Thai satay were perfectly done, the slow braised beef (fall-apart perfection), and the molten chocolate cake.

The watermelon salad was underwhelming, and we were a bit too full by the time the korean-style strip loin arrived.

The servers appeared to have undergone rigours of training, as each dish was carefully presented to us with an explanation of the ingredients and how we may wish to approach the dish. There was also a dedicated person to fill water glasses, which is a small thing but appreciated -- because usually you would only notice when you are waiting 10 minutes for your server to come around to fill your glass.

The menu is on the slightly pricier side, but we felt it was well worth it for the service and food quality. I would recommend it as one of the better King West restaurants."}
{"text":"First off, I can honestly say Lee is my favorite restaurant in Toronto! 

It isn't high-end or lavishly appointed, but provides both excellent quality, freshness and choice, in the heart of King West.

Food - A solid selection of mains and starters... none of which have ever disappointed me. 

The Singapore Slaw is the obvious choice and a staple with every meal.  Creative, fresh and tasty and like no other in Toronto.

The Caramelized Black Cod is another favorite - the perfect balance of mustard and preserves and always cooked to an ideal temperature and firmness.

The Spicy Tofu is addictive and a repeat dish for me which says a lot since I DON'T even like Tofu!

The Spicy Tuna Tartare was tasty and fresh but a bit of a small portion size.


Service - Fairly attentive, mostly young 20-30 something servers who know their menus and are friendly.


Environment - Lee has a bustling energetic feel to it.  I wouldn't recommend eating at the bar seats - it just doesn't feel right with the menu!  

There are a variety of tables/booths - some are nicely spaced out, others are too close together imo.  King West feel to the restaurant with some outdoor patio dining in the summer."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and had dinner. Innovative interesting food and nice environment. The service was very caring and attentive."}
{"text":"I find this place very overrated. The Singapore Salad rightfully lives up to its reputation and the dishes were tasty and attractive, but I wasn't floored with inspiration. 
  I'm allergic to garlic and so my choices were very limited. They tried to accommodate me but most things were prepared in a way that couldn't be altered.  Which to me says creative menu but the stuff must be pre made. I like places where the chef can think on their feet and make adjustments. 
The waiters were nice enough, but both had strong accents and spoke quietly. It's a noisy place with loud music, which made it even harder to hear them. 
  The dessert menu had unique items which was refreshing from the usual and our dessert was amazing and unique. Which we almost missed out on because after almost 20 minutes passed we had to remind them to bring the dessert, which was promptly brought out once we managed to get their attention. We were this close to cancelling it and pating and leaving as we were full and restless enough not to care at that point. 
  The decor was chic but the atmosphere was like that of a high end cafeteria/lounge with slippery floors, plastic chairs and glass tables all placed close together. Definitely lacks intimacy. When I go to places that are supposedly a big deal and pricey, I expect to have some elbow room and impeccable hospitality. 
  The staff was professional and well meaning but the experience wasn't remarkable. Not my kind of place."}
{"text":"So I am a HUGE foodie + the WORST critic when it comes to food...I'm also really really really picky in the food department. Came to Lee with my husband + my mom for my 1st Wedding Anniversary on New Year's Eve 2009 for a 9pm seating + Susur rocked it!

Each of us LOVED every single bite of every single dish + dessert. Susur was there in the restaurant (in town for the holidays?) + perhaps that's why every dish was impeccable tasting. Regardless, the service was beyond excellent.  We will return for sure. 

Best meal of all our lives + I have eaten in some amazing restaurants in NYC + San Fran (French Laundry, Gary Danko, Daniel, Gotham, etc. etc.)  Lee beat them hands down. Nice going Susur!"}
{"text":"I ate here with one other person in July.  The only thing that would have made this experience better was if we came with more people, this way we would have been able to try more dishes.

I had the best service I have ever had at Lee Lounge.  Our waiter was extremely busy, but somehow managed to be very attentive and professional.  

The food was to die for.  Everything was perfect.  Even the dessert, which I am often disappointed with in restaurants.  We didn't have a reservation, and they seated us within 10 min on a Friday night.  

We'll be back, but with way more people, so that we can sample the reset of the menu."}
{"text":"Susure Lee never fails to impress.  The amazing food coupled with great, knowledgeable servers, are what make this restaurant so good.  

Their Singaporean slaw with a gigantic mound of crispy noodles, veggies and edible flowers is A MUST ORDER.  I order it almost every time I'm there.  It's somewhat of an experience as your server brings out the towering salad and mixes it for you right at the table.  The well-balanced (sweet tinged) dressing is a great compliment to variety of textures present in this great salad.  

Melt in your mouth scallops made with a \"sand-like\" seasoning (yummmm) and Lee's signature Curry Chicken, Master Chef dish are all superbly executed.  Although the portions are not big, after sharing 4-5 dishes between two people, we were happily full. 

Thank you for the great experience!"}
{"text":"My all time fave restaurant! The slaw is to die for, I love how they present it and mix it up for you at the table. One time I actually saw Susie Lee walking around and checking the tables. The cocktails are great too, go for the feature drink from the cart."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto.  Amazing food.  I am not giving 5 starts only because I have had issues with the servers on occasion.  I have been spilt on there one night while being served our drinks.  I had no problem with this, accidents happen.  My issue was that the manager on duty did not offer to pay for our drinks.  They offered to comp our dessert at the end of the meal (which we do not order).  I would have expected more since I have given the restaurant a lot of business over the many years it has been open.  I have had one or two more instances such as this.  In terms of food however, I have NEVER been disappointed."}
{"text":"I love the food and ambiance of this place. We ordered Singaporean slaw with salmon, garlic tiger shrimp and Peking duck. The fusion of flavors in the slaw is just amazing! My taste bud felt like it was in Hongkong then to Singapore then to Macau to think I was in Toronto. lol

Garlic Tiger Shrimp is OK nothing special but I like the presentation. I usually have Peking duck when I travel to Asia and what we ordered at Lee is close to perfect. I really enjoyed the duck especially if you top it off with Foie Gras pate. We skip the dessert because nothing really catches our fancy. 

My only concern is the wheelchair access. I went to Lee with a friend of mine who was on wheelchair. The patio is wheelchair friendly because it is paved concrete. We want to go seat inside the restaurant but there's a minor problem.. they don't have a ramp. The hostess gathered 2 waiters to help lift my friend to the main entrance. Phew, thank goodness my friend is lightweight. We were thankful for the lift but I wish they have a small ramp that leads to the door. 

Overall we had a great time at Lee, succulent food and great service. The chic ambiance kinda reminds me of Buddha Bar in Dubai and Spice Market in NYC. 

I am definitely going back..."}
{"text":"The menu is extensive, something for everyone. The staff were courteous and very helpful. The Singapore Slaw was one of the best salads I have ever eaten. I would go back just to have the salad again. The cheeseburger spring roll was excellent as well. The wine list was very good and some very creative cocktails. It was a great evening out."}
{"text":"In Toronto with friends, came upon this restaurant through Yelp while looking for a good place to visit in China town. I'm must say Lee's did not disappoint!  Delicious coconut margaritas, started our evening; followed by their signature Singapore slaw along with a trio of their best dishes for a sharing menu.  The Peking Duck... Delish!  Their Top Chef Curry Roasted chicken... OMG!  And last but certainly not least their poached lobster and shrimp Ravioli with baby spinach. Take it from me, you must try this gem!"}
{"text":"We were seated promptly and the service was extremely attentive and prompt throughout our dinner. We had the slaw, black cod, and shrimp cheung fun, all of which were delicious; the cod, however, is the food item that would bring me back. It is probably one of the best renditions of fish I have enjoyed."}
{"text":"Lee is a restaurant that is dependably delicious and doesn't totally screw up the asian part of the asian fusion (this sounds very 90s?). The portions are decent, the atmosphere is great, and the servers are awesome. My favourite dish is the same as everyone else's: the Singapore Slaw. I have craved that dish and stopped by on my own for lunch before, that's how good it is. I've paid $20 - $100 per person here before so it does depend, but it is on the more expensive side. It gets busy fast, and the restaurant always feels packed so make resos. Last time I went with 7 people they just served us up a bunch of stuff and we were all thrilled, stuffed but thrilled (it came out to around $100pp drinks included). They also have an amazing sangria in the summer that's not cheap but so good."}
{"text":"Amazing food and ambiance.  Love his Singapore style slaw and egg rolls."}
{"text":"Being a fan of Susur Lee I was really looking forward to eating at Lee's but the experience fell far short of what I expected. As soon as we sat down and ordered our food came out straight away, even before our drinks, as if it was already made in the back and just sitting there. We also felt a bit rushed by the staff, As far as the food goes I was a big fan of the Singapore Salad but the rest of the food fell flat."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  Although a bit pricey, the food is phenomenal.  The \"slaw\" is the feature appetizer and it is amazing!  Service is dynamic!  Go there for a date with your significant other!"}
{"text":"I've lost count as to how many times I've been here.  The food and service is always stellar.  One of my fave restaurants in the city"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food at Lee. Lee's restaurants always guarantee a savoury, satisfying meal, with great service and ambiance. This is the type of place where, if you don't like to eat mustard or lamb, or if you think some of the ingredients in a dish seem odd together, you can just have faith that you'll enjoy the dish - the combinations always work on the palate. The Singaporean Slaw is a MUST. The menu says it serves two, but it actually generously serves four. 

This place is good for birthdays as well as date nights or special occasions. First you should know you don't even have to like Asian food to like the food at Lee. And, secondly, myself being Chinese, and usually hesitant to spend much money on Asian food, those hesitations are non-existent at Lee. He takes Asian food to a whole other level. This is not Chinatown type food, nor is it what Joey's or Earls call Asian fusion.

You can dress up or down(ish) without feeling out of place. A number of times I've also seen Lee himself (here and at Bent) and he's quite friendly, so that's fun. I've moved out of the west end, but will always travel back for a good ol', reliable, flavour explosion."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant but I never received my entree. Its definitely not a place for a quiet dinner. We received the slaw first which we really enjoyed. After 15 mins or so we received the octopus which was also really good but we kept getting a story about why the tuna sashimi was taking so long. We asked twice about my food before we just asked for it to go before even receiving it. We even received a desert plate with 'Happy Birthday' before receiving my entree. Needless to say I didn't have my dinner at the restaurant. I think they are just way to busy to keep up.
So sad to say I won't go there again, I didn't get to eat."}
{"text":"Some of the very best Asian cuisine I've ever had. A definite must-go if you're in the Toronto area!! The Singapore slaw is amazing and has a great variety of ingredients and flavors that pair very well together. We had a great waiter and had the chef's choice for our table of 6 and throughly enjoyed each course with surprise."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, no doubt about that.  Try everything, you really can't go wrong. 
My beef however, has nothing to do with food.  The night I gave Lee a shot I was expecting a little more energy.  Although the food was great, I honestly found the whole experience kinda boring.  Everyone seemed disconnected, and lonely.  Yes kinda depressing.  The lack of energy, really takes away from the whole dining experience.

Susar Lee came out for a second to greet the guests...but then disappeared never to be seen again.  That was really the only highlight.  

I also didn't like the high-school cafeteria feel of the restaurant.  Its too cramped,  with the tables too close together.  I really don't want to know what the couple next to me is doing after dinner.

But if the reviews are supposed to be about the food, I will say this.  The food is simple yet complex.  Very well presented, and it hits on so many levels.  Asiatic food at its finest.

I expect a little more energy from any place with Lee's name on it.  He looks so energetic on TV, I just wish that energy could be felt in his restaurants."}
{"text":"Had such a phenomenal experience at this establishment, I decide to create an account and write about it. Everything from the first greet from the hostess, to when we were given our bill...excellent!
Try sharing everything, almost like it was created for this...Seems like Susur takes his business very seriously, employees are on, food is fresh and delicious. Definitely be back and a fan now."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! OMG the food is delicious. Everything is so fresh, the flavours are fantastically blended and the meats/fish are just perfectly cooked. It's a treat to your taste buds. 

My favourite dishes - Singapore Slaw (must try for everyone) and Caramelized Black Cod. My mouth waters thinking about that wonderfully prepared black cod on a delicious turnip cake. The duck pancakes are great too, and fun to it. Same goes for the Pork Ribs. My husband absolutely loves the slow braised beef. In a nutshell, you really can't go wrong with anything you order there.

5-stars for service. Extremely attentive and friendly servers."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Had a great dinner. Their house salad is excellent. The atmposhpere is really cool too."}
{"text":"Decent food, but nothing awe inspiring. Crumby decor and vibe."}
{"text":"Excellent but expensive.

Went on a date at Lee; excellent service and focused menu. Fusion cuisine that is inventive. The food tastes great. 

Service is excellent and attentive. 

Great place for a special night out."}
{"text":"Everything was good to outstanding. Singapore slaw was one of the best things i've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Mel C.  and I decided to meet up at this trendy King west resto to catch up on the going ons of our lives since we hadn't seen each other for some time.  We decided to go for the Winterlicious menu since it offered a variety of choices. 

The restaurant is very trendy, dimly lit with a table gas light, and very hip music playing in the background.  It was reminiscent of the night that I spent at Blowfish.  I've passed by this restaurant so many times on my way home walking on King Street.  It seems to attract the 25-30 something young professional crowds post work social or work dinners.  Most men were dressed in a collard shirt and a v-neck sweater, while the ladies sported casual but stylish wear.  The interior made you feel as though you were transported to a different world or time with very modern yet simple decor.  The seating is very cosy and close together, and the small space was designed to make the space feel bigger than it actually is.  

The waiter promptly came to take our drink order. We ordered tea with a hint of mint in it.  The wait staff is very courteous, overly cheerful and friendly, it made you wonder if they always like to sing for their supper in this manner.  Our waiter explained that usually, without Winterlicious, it is a \"sharing\" type menu and \"encouraged\" us to order different things from the regular menu.  We had several waiters come up to us to ask us if we needed any explanation on the menu. I got confused after awhile who exactly was our waiter.  They all sounded and looked the same...very young, very friendly, overly helpful in their enthusiam to explain the menu.  So I asked one of them to explain the various winterlicious items. He obliged. I inquired on the portions since i was curious to know the size of each menu item however given that this is a fine dining type place, the standard is a moderate portion, but usually of good quality.

So we proceeded to order the hot and sour soup as apetizers. The -20 degree temperature outside called for it.  Also, being asian, we wanted to sample the soup to see how it compared to the authentic stuff that you can get at the high end chinese restaurants. The soup did not disappoint.  It was very tasty, full of flavour, and adequate high quality ingredients.  For the main course, we ordered curry chicken  (Fresh Ground green curry chicken, Sweet pea polenta, butter almondine, sundried tomato jam oven dried pineapple, chili mint chutney).  There was nothing very curry like about this chicken although it tasted pretty good.  It looked like it was deep fried in batter.  I could not taste much of the other ingredients nor the curry.  We also ordered the Spiced Slow Braised Beef with Romano bean puree & daikon puree.  This dish was very succulent and rich.  The beef melts in your mouth and the fat that it was probably cooked in, made it very flavorful. Probably not what you should be eating if you are looking to lose weight. Although the portion is small enough that those on a diet need not worry. For dessert, we ordered the creme caramel and the Panna Cotta.  Both were very delicious.  The creme caramel was very creamy and had a good consistency and flavor.  The Panna Cotta was topped with some exotic fruit that tasted very tangy and rasberry sauce.  Both contrasted each other well, although we both agreed that the Creme Caramel would win hands down if there were a show down.

Overall the ambiance, the decor, the service, and the food was very good. Our bill including tax and tip came to about $100 since we did the Winterlicious menu.  Its pretty pricey considering you may still be a bit hungry afterwards but it was probably a bargain considering the average price for a meal these days at trendy restaurants on King West.  We also did not have any alcohol, which kept our bill on the lower end. 

I would recommend this restaurant if you are into trendy decor, ambiance, overly attentive wait staff, and fine dining style type of food.  I had a good experience and would definitely consider going back. I am not usually into asian fusion given that I am asian and  into authentic asian food, but if i had to choose a fusion trendy resto, this would be on my top 5 list."}
{"text":"My partner and I recently celebrated with dinner at Lee.  Despite a few small criticisms, overall I was very impressed and would go back again.  

The food was very good, although not exactly cheap!  I gather it is less expensive than Lees other restaurants, but at over $200 for a meal (with wine) I would not classify it as a cheap place for dinner!

My partner and I ordered 6 dishes and there was more than enough food to leave us feeling satisfied.  Our waiter was fantastic.  He did not make us feel rushed, even when we went over the two hour limit.  He was very helpful and knowledgeable without being pushy or hovering (which I despise!)  He was also careful to bring out dishes separately so we never had more than two dishes on our small table.  Despite the proximity of the tables, I thought the ambiance in the restaurant was pretty good.  Lively and upbeat, with a packed house who all seemed to enjoy the food as much as we did.   

While the food was great, I do have one major criticism.  I felt that the tables were placed too closely together.  If we had sat beside quiet neighbors this would not have been a huge problem, but unfortunately we sat beside an obnoxious food critic from the states who yelled into her cell phone a number of times during our meal.  I can't really blame the restaurant for her behavior, but I did find it irritating!  Her constant questions to the waiter were distracting, but I was impressed by how well the poor guy handled himself.  She made him list off every ingredient in each dish, and then wait while she wrote it down in her little book!  I also found her questions irritating, as I thought they seemed quite uneducated for a supposed \"food writer.\"  Despite this unplesant aspect of our meal I still left feeling happy and satisfied.  I will definitely be returning to Lee restaurant in the future.  
 
Below is a list of the food we ordered, and our humble opinions!

Singaporean style slaw:
no comments needed, it is a great mixture of textures and traditional Japanese flavors that I highly recommend.  

Mussels in white wine (it was a special):
again, very good.  I felt the parsley flavor was a tad strong, but my partner loved the fresh flavor of parsley.  

Spicy crispy tofu:
I was hesitant to order this dish as agedashi tofu is one of my favorite dishes and I didn't want to mess with a great thing, but this take on tofu is amazing.  The coating was light but flavorful and the tofu was deliciously creamy.  The sauce was a honey chili glaze that I thought was amazing, although I didn't taste any of the  \"heat\" I would expect from a dish titled \"spicy.\"     

Garlic Shrimp:
although good, this was my least favorite of the bunch.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked but I found the sun dried tomato flavor a little boring in comparison to the rest of the dishes.

Braised beef:
This was our waiters favorite dish, and with good reason!  The beef was also our favorite dish.  There are no criticisms from us!

Duck confit roll:
I loved this crepe- like dish immensely, especially the goat cheese on top.  My partner is not a huge fan of goat cheese, so he did not think as highly of this dish.  I understand how someone who doesn't love goat cheese the way I do could find the flavor overwhelming.  I also found the candied nuts on top delicious, but not perfectly executed.  The syrup from the candied nuts was a little too thick and hard in my opinion.  Overall still a fantastic dish that I would order again."}
{"text":"4 out of 5! Great place to go with a group. I recommend Singaporean- style slaw and Thai rack of lamb! $$$"}
{"text":"I cant believe this restaurant. I just called to make a reservation for 8 people for my birthday. They said there was a mandatory $55 minimum per person before tax and tip and not including any alcohol. Then they asked me to leave my credit card to hold the reservation. I will never go there and that kind of restaurant ettique is not exceptable."}
{"text":"A very large disappointment overall, close to the worst dining experience I've ever had  The dinner started with the suggestion of doing the chefs choice sampler family style since we were a group of 11 and then he proceeded to leave without taking a drink order. Can I have at least the promise of a drink while I consider my meal?

When the waiter returned 10 minutes later we made our choice of following his suggestion and finally took our drink orders. The problem with family style is that we were being served our 2nd plate of food before the drinks came. 

The first plate was a tuna sashimi and tuna tartar. An excellent first plate, I don't enjoy fish but I seem like good sashimi and this was very good sashimi. I was really looking forward to the remainder of the meal. It is kinda cool when you don't know what coming next. 

What came next my martini and their slaw in unison. I have to agree with an earlier review and say the slaw was a little too sweet which played against a little too much cilantro and did not work for me. The martini was ok but my twist left a lot to be desired, looked like t had been done with a machete.  My girlfriend had their manhattan special which was nice but not $18 a piece nice. 

3rd course was The beef carpaccio a real disappointment. The flavour wasn't there and had nothing to offer. One of the people in our party had mentioned they didn't enjoy raw food and this was the second raw course in 3 dishes. Thanks for listening, oh wait you can't hear anything in the restaurant cause it's just too loud. 

Scallops were next I didn't try the scallop but I did steal the bacon and was way overdone and too salted. My girlfriend says the scallop was quite good  After that was black cod with miso. The smell didn't work for me so I didn't try but the girlfriend says it was cooked very well.

Crab cakes were next and while good there was only 4 cakes served for 11 people. Next up was lamb and potatoes, now we're talking! I love lamb and this had no taste to it in the least. It was a shame because it was cooked perfectly. At this point there was only desert left and I was still starving. 

Desert was good but not great. The ice cream and molten chocolate cake was great, the pear tart and other stuff is average at best. 

While some food was great. I came away feeling that not enough food was served for the amount of money paid, the atmosphere sucked and the wait staff a little poncey and yelley. Felt a little scammed on the food and the drink prices."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to review this place for quite some time.  Beautiful interior, attentive wait staff, delicious food.  While it's definitely on the expensive side, it's an experience.  As everyone else, I enjoy the slaw a lot as well.  Fresh cilantro, delicious"}
{"text":"One of the best (and most interesting) restaurant experiences I've had in recent memory.  Went with a large group while in Toronto on business, all of whom have different tastes and tolerances to spicy foods.  Add to that my GF requirements, and my expectations weren't too high.  I've never been so happy to be wrong!

Server was great - a bit overdramatic, struck me as the theatrical/drama type, but he was just so darn cute that we could forgive him for it.  And, bless him, he dealt with a table of 6 loud Americans (and one Brit) who were trying to out-drink each other all night.  He kept the cocktails coming, for which he was handsomely rewarded.  Note: don't be fooled by the fancy name for the blanco tequila thing... it's just lime juice and tequila, and it tastes like gasoline.

We took his suggestion to order the \"Chef's Choice\" meal (we have a few foodies in the group who lost their ish over eating in a Top Chef restaurant).  The first course - the slaw perhaps? - was presented in a way so beautifully artistic that it actually pained me to destroy it with my fork.  Each subsequent item was presented with an eloquent description, perfectly timed to coincide with the end of the previous course.  Our server took note of my GF needs and in some cases, prepared a specific GF version of the main course item just for me (+10 points right there).  I love that it was a bunch of things I wouldn't normally order - really forced us to step outside of our comfort zones and try some really delicious food, and I'm sooo glad I did.  Two words: green curry.  Seriously, you need to eat it.

Dessert looked delicious... I'm not qualified to give much of a review here as I was only able to eat one of the 5 or 6 options, but that one thing was yummy.

Overall... call ahead, make a reservation, and go there. Just avoid the tequila cocktail (stick with the seasonal Bellini, can't go wrong).  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious, ambiance is hip, but food is just meh. 

Atmosphere: around 6:00 p.m., it was nice and quiet, and the restaurant was half empty, with a laid back, \"chill\" feel. once 7:00 p.m. passed, it got loud, the music (electronica?) was turned up way high, and we couldn't hear each other over the table. deco is tasteful, but some of the futuristic/metal tones clash with the hyper-oriental furnishings. 

Service: All servers are dressed in all-black business casual wear. Front of house people are very prompt and courteous. Our server, on the other hand, was friendly and haughty at the same time. It was difficult to predict how he would act the next time he came around. Water was refilled and food was served very promptly. The servers also take the time to describe everything on your plate (which must take forever to memorize...).

Food: Off the summerlicious menu: watermelon feta salad, salmon.

I was very much looking forward to the Watermelon feta salad, but it was a huge disappointment. The watermelon cubes were so sweet and juicy, but they ruined it by putting too much soy balsamic and salty crunchy bits on top. Honestly, it was so salty that I could eat only 2 pieces (of 7). The server looked kind of offended when I said I was done, but honestly, it was a FAIL. 

Salmon was tasty, and the crunchy rice noodles were a nice touch, but overall the sauce was a strange match, especially because it contained raisins. 

Dessert (all three come out with summerlicious option) receives mixed reviews. Two were different from the online menu (the meringue comes with rhubarb compote rather than strawberries; mousse is white chocolate mousse with jackfruit and strawberries), but this wasn't problematic. The meringue and rhubarb pairing was interesting; very tart to the point that lips were puckering up, but I'm a huge fan of tart flavours. The mousse was not memorable, and the banana spring roll was too sweet, with no other flavour kicks.

Overall: Food is beautifully presented, but flavours are either too strong or unimpressive. Since my judgments are usually based on flavour and atmosphere, I can't say I'm a fan. There are a lot of better options in King West. However, I may return to try the slaw, considering the great reviews it received."}
{"text":"Been here twice. The first time it was excellent and the second was meh. Maybe because it was New Years Eve the 2nd time. $430 for 2 people and we were hungry and sober when we left."}
{"text":"The first time we went, we were really impressed.  However the second time we weren't as impressed.  There were six of us and we ordered everything on the menu. The slaw is a must have! But nothing else was memorable. The service was good."}
{"text":"came here for my birthday this past Saturday and I must say. I am very happy I picked Lee to host my birthday dinner!! The staff has been so helpful and accommodating to everything. Our server was super knowledgable and made the right recommendations to food choices and portions.  We had a group of 7 and was able to pick items off the menu instead of a prix fixe menu. 

Loved when the food was bought to the table, the staff gave a full description as to all the ingredients and all the dish was prepared!

The food was soooo amazing buy totally recommend the coleslaw, edamame and the spicy crispy tofu!!

Will for sure come back again!!"}
{"text":"I went to Lee with my family for my mom's birthday and I was skeptical as I was expecting overpriced fushion food. However, I can say it was actually pretty good. Here's what we ate between 5 people and we were full. 
- Susur's Signature Singaporean-style Slaw - with seared sashimi tuna -  this was delicious! It didn't disappoint as I've heard great things. 
- Lentil & Quinoa Croquettes - this was also very good. Mind you my sister wasn't a big fan I think because of the textures. It looks like a deep fried taro ball from dim sum. 
- Hunanese Lobster Ravioli - this was just ok. The ravioli was made with wonton wrappers and was definitely not worth $29!!! Also the server warned us multiple times this dish was spicy but it was just a little bit spicy. Apparently the spiciest thing on the menu which my whole family disagreed with.
- Top Chef Green Curry Chicken - the flavours were good and it was dark meat but this dish was NOT served hot so we were disappointed given the name. 
- Jerk Spicy Pork Ribs - this was also delicious!! The meat was so tender and fall of the bone. This dish was definitely spicer than the lobster ravioli. I would recommend this dish. The portion was quite decent too! This was served with steamed chinese buns which was amazing! 
We also saw Susur Lee at the end of our meal which was nice."}
{"text":"Always love Lee.

The Singaporean slaw shows the incredible skill of Susur. When slaw hits this level you know anything on the menu will be fantastic."}
{"text":"I expected to have very high quality food but I was very disappointed. This restaurant is not even comparable to other 'chef Lee's restaurant. Overpriced and totally not worth it. The watermelon salad was good. We got the risotto and black pepper marinated beef was OK. The waitress made a huge deal of the special slaw which was also OK. The service was good. If you wanna GI to Susur Lee restaurant make sure you go to BENT. Very disappointed in this restaurant and the quality of food."}
{"text":"Great food (tasting menu) and great service (Greg and Seth) combined for a special meal. Started with the famous slaw salad which was fresh and delicious and made our way through 8 other dishes. In addition to the slaw, our favorites included the cod, lamb, top chef masters chicken, and short ribs. A couple of the dishes came out a bit too fast and the timing of the wine pairing was off a bit. Tables are too close together but it gave us a closer look at what our neighbors were enjoying..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and I was really looking forward to it as I had heard a lot about Susur Lee. The most memorable dishes we had were the slow braised beef and the rack of lamb. The slow braised beef simply melted in your mouth with rich earthy flavours!  It tasted like the meat had been braising for two days!  The lamb was cooked medium rare and was deliciously juicy and not gamey at all. Best lamb I have ever had. I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Chef lee really is amazing. All his dishes are unique and delicious. For a nice night out its a great spot to hit. The prices are higher but they are definitely worth it because all the dishes are something new that you would not have at just your average restaurant. It's always nice to take the servers advise here because you can trust that they will point you in the right direction. Treat yourself and enjoy."}
{"text":"Wow... I really didn't know what fine dining was until I came to Lee's Restaurant. My brother decided to bring the family here in celebration of his new job... and I'm glad he did. We had an enjoyable experience here as we were able to try a variety of high quality dishes. 

The service here was amazing as well. We had one main server who catered to our every need. He explained every dish that was served and made sure our table was always clean. My mother is a strict vegetarian so it can be difficult when eating out (no meat, garlic, onion family). We mentioned this to our waiter and the chef prepared something on the spot (off-menu) that fit accordingly to my mom's vegetarian diet and it still came out delicious. 

We started out with their signature Singaporean-style slaw, which was tossed in front of us. The fried taro on top of the salad gave it a delightful crunch. We also ordered the Cheeseburger Spring Rolls, which was AWESOME!!! I still think about it from day to day haha :) We were also able to order the Beef Wellington, which is a special off-menu item that was available at the time and is great as well. Other dishes we ordered from the menu are: Caramelized Black Cod, Top Chef Curry Chicken, and Lobster Ravioli. For dessert: Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar and Signature French & Chinese Tong Yuen. 

My favorites would probably be: Singaporean-style slaw, Cheeseburger Spring Rolls, Beef Wellington and the French & Chinese Tong Yuen. Overall, this restaurant is top notch in terms of their food AND service. Food presentation was beautiful. The night we went, the restaurant had a calm, peaceful ambiance. It was a great experience and I would definitely recommend to coming here at least once in your life!"}
{"text":"We went here for winterlicious on a Friday. The scene is very clubby, with hiphop/pop playing fairly loud (loud enough that it was a bit difficult to have a conversation). I went in knowing thqt Susur Lee is a pretty famous Toronto chef, so I was expecting top quality. The food was incredibly underwhelming. We tried a few of the dishes (beef, salmon, chicken, puff pastry and the trio of desserts), nothing wowed us and I ended up leaving food on the plate (which I never do at restaurants).  I had the Parisian cocktail $18, which tasted like a pretty regular old fashioned with some walnuts thrown in, while my fiancé had a Stella $10 for a regular sized bottle of Stella in a tall glass (not a proper beer glass)....we are not cheap, but the drinks just aren't worth it. You can get better drinks elsewhere for cheaper. The staff was pretty attentive, and made sure we were taken care of. Overall, I wouldn't go back. This place is more of a club/lounge than a quality restaurant. I honestly expected better from a 'top chef', it just seems like the club atmosphere is trying to mask the subpar food. They also had a cocktail girl going around with her cart offering mixed drinks...I guess it's the upper scale version of a beer cart girl...Maybe I'm too old for the club scene (28), but when I pay good money for food and drinks I expect better."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved everything about this place. Delicious food and great servers. No line up to get into this restaurant. Lots of parking nearby. You have to eat their slaw. Most amazing dish. We are 25 years old and did not feel out of place here."}
{"text":"Exquisite attention to detail from the team of top chef Susur Lee. A sensual treat of flavours and textures keeps every tapas-size item a thrill to experience. Asian references abound on both food and drink menus, and while prices are high, you will appreciate the artistry placed on the selection and preparation of every ingredient, and the measure of knowledge and hospitality the staff pay towards every customer."}
{"text":"Delicious food, pricey but not outrageous, witnessed a car accident while sitting in the front outdoor space. Overall good meal. 
We ordered the Singapore slaw it's just as amazing as everyone else said. Really interesting blend of flavors, the texture is the perfect balance. I was weary at first but it is really THAT good. The curry chicken was good. Dipping it in curry batter is ingenious.  The polenta that came with the curry chicken was disappointing maybe because it was added on like an afterthought or the frozen pea and corn inside it. The lamb was decent. I like the mint sauces, the lamb itself was good but I'm not blown away.  Asians tend to like meats that are marinated so probably just personal preference. 
I'm not usually a big desert person but the tang yuen really works! It's Chinese tang yuen with a chocolate hazelnut filling. My grandma would probably say it's too sweet and rich but I think it's delicious and the texture was just like my grandma's tang yuen!
Second time I went back, I had the Peking duck, which is an interesting take on Peking duck and chasu.  It was delicious but not quite Peking duck because it lacked the crispy skin.  Also it was very rich, definitely a dish you should share with three people.
This restaurant is worth a visit. Don't let all the hype and publicity discourage you. The place is actually serving good food. Oh and Susur came by another perk if you like celebrity chefs."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a few years now for special occasions and have always loved the food - starting with the Singapore salad and ending with the peanut butter bar or whatever desert is on the menu.  The only inconsistency we have found over the years is the service.   The staff there range from courteous professionals who go out of their way to make your night special to self absorbed punks not waiting long enough for you to finish saying thank you before walking away.  Having said that, if you are looking for a beautiful food experience, go to Lee's"}
{"text":"Simply AMAZING! This is the best dining experience I have had in Toronto.

We went with 6 girlfriends and they were able to do a chef's tasting menu to compliment exactly  what we wanted. We just told the waitress what menu items caught our eye and she just took it away from there and every course she presented us with was unbelievably tasty.

What we loved:
- Singapore Slaw
- Beef Brisket
- Dumplings

It was a top notch experience from start to finish. Service was impeccable, the place was bumpin, but not too noisy and the DJ was spinning great background music. Dishes were presented impeccably and tasted even better than they looked.

To top it off, the bill was a great surprise. $75/pp with a few bottles of wine and a fantastic memorable meal worth every penny. I will be back as often as I can! I am dreaming about the singapore slaw."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Lee's and as a great introduction via Summerlicious for 2012, it can't be beat.  I will definitely be coming back as a regular customer.

While my friends and I ordered from the Summerlicious menu, we decided to also split the Singapore slaw.  I have never understood how vegans could do it, but in that brief moment, I almost decided if I could have this salad every day as a vegan, I'd be okay giving up meat (maybe for a day or two).

The starter was the shrimp cake, very light and soft inside, not like a traditional crab cake one would be familiar with, dense and doughy.  This one seemed to ooze out in a delicious manner from a hard spherical shell, dripping down into a bed of lettuce.

The main course I had was the chicken dumplings gratin.  While tempted to get the braised beef like my friends, I decided to have this instead, and was not disappointed.  Topped with succulent shrimp, the dumplings were moist and delicious, and the spinach gratin was amazing.

Finally for desert, I decided to go for the Jade Almond cake, although I was sorely tempted to go for the coconut crème caramel.  However, the almond cake was delicious, not too sweet, with licorice crème anglaise, and served with a side of chocolate mousse that had a hint of citrus in it.

This was a great evening, even with a busy environment, and I do look forward to coming here more often.  Summerlicious did it's job and converted me to a regular customer."}
{"text":"Honestly, this might have been the best restaurant experience of my life.

My boyfriend and I had reservations for 9:30 on a Saturday night, but thought we'd pop in earlier (around 8) to see if they could fit us in. They could! And we got a table which is a little removed from the bustle of the main dining room, so it was perfect.

We started off with a drink special of the night, which was a delicious watermelon martini. Then, we ordered five dishes to split between us and a glass of wine each. We got the Chickpea Sweet Onion Fritter, Mexican Goat Cheese Tart, Curry Chicken, Caramelized Black Cod, and Rack of Lamb. 

These dishes all played with flavour in a way that I imagine is very unique to Susur Lee. For example, the fritter was crunchy, yet creamy; savoury, sour, and sweet--all at once. A delight. My favourites were probably the Mexican Goat Cheese Tart and the Caramelized Black Cod. The tart, with black olives, avocado, goat cheese, tomato, etc--was enveloping. It was like a savoury, decadent pillow. The cod was just spectacular. My boyfriend flipped for it. The Curry Chicken and Rack of Lamb were both excellent, as well. If you go, you must get the cod. You will love it.

Aside from the food, the service was superb. Our waiter was attentive and helpful, he brought all the dishes very quickly--we hardly waited between dishes at all!

Bottom line: if you want to have an incredible meal with impeccable service and don't mind spending a little extra for it, this restaurant is the one. It's worth it."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place! Me and my husband went there for a mother's day. They had a special $50 for 3 dishes for a person. Every single dish was unbelievably delicious. Especially I enjoyed their cheeseburger spring roll - I have never tried anything like that before in my life! Amazing! I can also recommend Raspberry Mojito Martini - It was to die for! Some of the reviewers in here complain about the service- but I found it to be excellent! Our waiter (and the rest of the staff) was very professional and attentive. You could tell they love what they do. Also, we never waited for more then 10 minutes between courses. I will definitely come back there for a special occasion (this place is pricey)!"}
{"text":"That Singaporean Slaw!! The very thought is making my mouth water! 

Great atmosphere both inside and on the patio!! 2 bar areas and they've done a great job with the waiting area.  

The service is top notch. Every server knows detailed knowledge of the menu and they are not hesitant to prove it. 

The food is amazing, it's known to be Asian Fusion and they've done a great job with the menu. Although I feel the vegetarian options are lacking, but if you inform your server they will speak to the chef, so once again, service is top notch!"}
{"text":"The ambience is so authentic and the service is very friendly.

Started with the Singaporean slaw which is my new favourite salad - 19 ingredients and Justin was able to rhyme them all!

For the main, we shared the award winning Green Curry Chicken - a really new way of presenting curry chicken. They were Chicken balls in green sauce and pineapple slices - the flavours went well together.

the feature dessert of banana chocolate bread and a sour sorbet was wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants in Toronto. The food is fantastic.  The service is great.The slaw, top chef chicken curry and the Korean style skirt steak were just delicious. The molten chocolate cake needs improvement, but was good. This restaurant has fair prices for the quality and quantity you get. It is now my benchmark when comparing other restaurants in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"*Preamble on Asian Fusion*

Let me start by saying that I'm very skeptical about Asian Fusion because 1. I am a Chinese person from Hong Kong and Vancouver, who's been spoiled by both city's excellent Chinese cuisine and 2. I've been to enough restaurants calling themselves \"Asian Fusion\" who have charged a premium for ruining a perfectly delicious pork bun by slathering it with something \"creative\" like a fruity chutney or wrapping a meat ball in filo pastry, as if that counts as thinking outside of the box and not what it is - horribly offensive.

Sadly, most Asian fusion restaurants just slap two culinary cultures together with no real thought toward the end product. Or worse, they serve mediocre Asian food and dress up the restaurant with a trendy, hipster vibe - a Buddhist statue here, some vintage Chinese porn there (the restrooms at Vancouver's Bao Bei), low lighting and bada bing, bada boom, a restaurant du jour is born. It's easier to overcharge that way, you see?

Basically, I'm *very* grumpy about Asian Fusion because I've yet to try a place that actually delivers on the idea of two culinary cultures merging to make something new, delicious, and justifiably pricey (and for those in Vancouver, don't even try to cite Bao Bei as an example. Just no).

 *Review of Lee*

Lee, however, was nowhere near as offensive as Red Door in Vancouver (now shuttered, thank goodness) or Bao Bei in Vancouver. Lee serves good, sophisticated food (some more Asian than others) that's delicious if not exactly creative (the $29 miso caramelized black cod is a staple in every mid to high-end Japanese restaurant, and the addition of a mushy turnip cake does not do it any favours). As many have mentioned, the Singapore slaw was phenomenal and easily the stand-out dish of the night. The eggplant and cucumber salad was zesty and delicious, but the roasted root vegetables were the very definition of ho-hum. The meat eaters at our table liked the braised beef well enough, but not enough to actually finish it. Desserts were extremely decent. The white chocolate and banana turnover was a snooze, and the pear tart (a special) even more so.

Service was friendly and attentive. Three people at our table asked for warm water (it was freezing that night!) and were brought individual tea pots that were periodically filled by our server throughout the meal = A+. The space is dimly lit and spacious. Even though it was nearly full, the chatter and background music weren't overpowering, making it a great place for a date or an intimate gathering. No obnoxious zen music or DJ spinning here.

Even though Lee didn't knock me off my feet and make me see the error of my Asian Fusion-hating ways, I would recommend it for its solidly good food. It wasn't as creative as I'd like, and with dishes (sharing plates, by the way) running between $25-32, it's definitely pricey. As an Asian Fusion restaurant, with all the expectations that comes with the term, it's OK. But as a restaurant, it's very good."}
{"text":"Lee Restaurant.  I have owed you a glowing review since this past July, so here it is.  

How do I start?  Three simple words: You.  Are.  Amazing.  

Of all the restaurants I've visited this year, this is one of my favourites.  I can't even begin to describe how much I enjoyed my food.  I had the pleasure of eating the Hunanese Lobster Ravioli, Cheeseburger Spring Rolls, and Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar.  All insanely good.

The Lobster Ravioli ($28), which at first I thought was too expensive for what I was told was \"only\" four ravioli, was nicely spiced and VERY filling - note, the four ravioli are large and garnished with shrimp!  I wasn't actually expecting this to be spicy, even though it's a Hunanese-style ravioli (not that I'm familiar with Hunanese cuisine, it's just that I didn't think it would be spicy!).  The spice was bolder than I had expected and I predict that it may be a bit much for those with a lower tolerance for heat.  There was more than enough lobster in each bite and I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.

Cheeseburger Spring Rolls ($14) - From what I recall, I couldn't even fit any more food in my stomach while at the table (didn't I say the ravioli was filling?) but (of course!) my appetite came back when I got home.  I reheated these in the oven and once again - amazing.  They were cheesy and hamburger-y but much more gourmet.  The ONLY thing I didn't like about these (two substantial) rolls was the mint.  I.  Can't.  Stand.  Mint.  And.  Meat. Together.  To me it's just weird (generally speaking) although luckily the overall, sweet-ish seasoning and cheesy, hamburger-y goodness of the rolls (wrapped in lettuce by the way!) more than made up for my mint-meat aversion.

Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar ($12) - Oh my goodness.  This was exquisite.  Smooth, milk chocolate-y, peanut buttery goodness on a chocolate (I think!) wafer!  Very delicious and for $12 I thought this was an excellent value!  I tried to eat the jackfruit garnish and found it kind of - um - unappetizing.  In sum, pick off the garnish and dig in!  I barely shared this dessert with the others at my table.  If you order this, don't share it - with anyone.  Don't even get up to go to the washroom until you've completely savoured and devoured this dessert.  It's really good - I promise. 

*Watermelon-feta salad ($18 - this doesn't appear to be on the current menu) - I didn't order this but luckily someone shared this with me!  This salad was incredibly refreshing, tasty, and the portions were HUGE.  There were about 8 large pieces of watermelon garnished with feta, sprouts, and other good stuff.  This is a VERY good dish for sharing (if it's available!).  Also, I loved the presentation.

Service: If the food wasn't SOO amazing, I would probably knock off one star for this.  Our waiter was very friendly but WAYYYYY too salesman-like.  Like are you trying to sell me home appliances?  He suggested the Singapore Slaw  and REALLY pushed it.  I also distinctly recall him saying (no, very strongly SELLING!) that my table (of 4) should order sharing-style plates.  We opted against it but he was SO pushy.  This is where they REALLY (I mean REALLY) need to knock it off.  Be friendly, make (a few) suggestions, and let the food speak for itself.  

Atmosphere: Lounge-y?  We had a seat close to the window and I was sitting in a very plush chair so it was definitely comfortable.  It was a bit dark in the restaurant but facing the window provided enough light.

Price: It's expensive.  My ravioli was $28.  Yes, I know it was lobster.  Yes, I know it was VERY filling and delicious.  And yes, I know it's Susur.  I mention price, however, because this may turn off some of the more value-conscious customers.  (Seriously, go look at the prices of their cocktails!) But again - Lee.  Is.  Amazing.

Overall: One of the things I also want to emphasize is that Lee does an EXCELLENT job in presenting their food.  Each dish was artfully plated and of course delicious.  Since my first visit, I've vowed to return but (sadly) haven't yet.   After writing this review and reminiscing, I'm sure I'll be back VERY soon.

In conclusion, go to Lee Restaurant!!"}
{"text":"My second time to Lee did not disappoint! The Singapore Slaw is still the talk of the town. So much flavour! Wine was incredible and all of our dishes were bursting with flavour. I find the lighting in the back room a little too dim to fully appreciate the art of how the dishes come displayed. My only big criticism is that the wait staff have zero sense of humour and take themselves too seriously but the food more than makes up for that."}
{"text":"The meal I shared with a friend last night was outstanding.  Must haves are the singapore-style Slaw with salmon, beef tartare and the cheeseburger wraps.  The coriander infused chocolate mousse was incredible.  Wine prices are very reasonable but unless it's a very special night stay clear of the very pricey cocktails.  Dinner for two - and we were stuffed - with a bottle of wine and the three choices plus a shared dessert was $120 - exceptional value.  Attentive service and lively atmosphere made for a great festive night."}
{"text":"Ate there the other night for the 3rd time in the past two years. The food was good but I couldn't get over how pushy the waitress was trying to get us to order the chef's selection.  Why on earth would I want chef's surprise for dinner. Half the fun of going to a restaurant is looking at the menu and choosing something you really want...as well our party of 10 was told that a minimum of  $55 per person for food had to spent. Hey Susar - when did you become such a Fusion Asshole?"}
{"text":"I have eaten here in the past and a much better dining experience. New Years Eve not so much- over priced corkage, tasting menu sub par and turning over tables is more the objective than the dinning experience. Not the dining experience I was expecting or hoping for-  Le Select, Baca  two other places I dined on this trip both exceptional. This was definitely more flare than flavor. Definite thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Went to LEE for a special occasion dinner. We were both super excited and then ended up having one of the worst dining experiences we've had. Everything from the service to the food to the way the place was running seemed off. When the hostess walked us into one of the dining rooms, she warned us that the floor was slippery in there. This strikes me as the perfect encapsulation of what's wrong with the place. We know the floor of our restaurant is slippery enough to warn people about, but we're keeping this floor!

Cocktails were very weak. The sake-tini had bits of something (edible flower?) floating in it. We got the oysters, which were a special. From PEI. They seemed a little past their prime, as did the grated horseradish. The famed Singapore slaw was too much for two people. And I don't see what's so great about it. It's just bite after interminable bite of the same flavor/texture. Ours had too much of the sickly sweet beet dressing on the bottom. And when the server \"performed\" the mixing at the table, pieces were flying out of the bowl ending up all over the table and on our serving plates--and they were left as is. A theme for the night began: the servers extolling the virtues of the food, raising expectations too high. Going on and on about Susur Lee's reputation. The next dish--crab croquettes. Four medium sized croquettes, on a large oval plate too big to fit on our tiny table. Why such big plates when your two-tops are this small? Also, our server took this dish away when there was still one croquette remaining. Not cool. For our second round of drinks, my friend ordered a martini (not off the cocktail menu) so I decided to also order a margarita. The server looked confused and said \"we don't have any of the slushy stuff.\" And I was like, that's not what I want. I'm just looking for a classic margarita, on the rocks. He responds, \"so just tequila with some lime?\" He rushes off (throughout the meal he was distracted and other employees were constantly getting in the way). I decided to avoid paying $18 for a mess of a drink so I flag him down and ask him to change it to a bottle of beer before he puts it in the system. I wouldn't normally do this, but I was already over this place. Then they bring out our last dish--except it's the wrong dish. It's the braised beef. We had ordered the \"Top Chef\" green curry chicken. Our server had gone on and on about how it was a great choice, and a winning dish for Lee. He even repeated the whole order back to us. It must have just been an error on his part but combined with the other things it was very annoying. When the dish arrived, it was so lackluster I couldn't believe it. The dish on the menu has about a million ingredients listed in it but absolutely none of them came through. Bland on bland! The plating of the dish was also knocked over by the server when it was put down on the table. And the bill came to...$198 pre-tip. Ouch. That hurt.

We go to restaurants all the time (both high end and dive and in the middle) and I've also worked as a server, so I don't think our expectations were unreasonable or over the top. It was a major waste. Not enjoyable in the least. Won't be going back. There are much better places in the city (Buca, to name a nearby restaurant) with a better dining experience. I can't believe the hype on this place. I wish we had gone elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went with two friends for Winterlicious.. but had the signature 19 ingredient salad as well - it's a DO NOT MISS item - I could eat it for dinner several times a week and not get bored - textures and tastes are amazing!  The rest of the meal did not disappoint either - we left full and happy. Service was right on point and the decor is lovely with a nice atmosphere. I will definitely return to try other things!"}
{"text":"Make sure to order the coleslaw. Drinks are a bit overpriced but completely overshadowed by the amazing food and over the top service. Total ~$75 per person"}
{"text":"Abominable service combined with mediocre food.

Held an event here and it was a disaster. Just an epic disaster. Mains and apps coming out at the same time, people finished their entire meals before others saw any food, server disappearing for literally an hour.

I have no idea why this place has a positive reputation. Everyone left disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I absolutely love it!! It's kind of tapas style in that the dishes are made for sharing. I think 3 dishes for 2 people is perfect. The must try dishes:

Singaporean Slaw - this has something like 17 homegrown ingredients. It is pretty much a salad but the best salad I've ever had! The different textures and flavours are to die for. To be honest, every time I toy with the idea of just eating this for my meal.

Green Curry Chicken - this is not what you imagine curry chicken to be. Try it - you'll see what I mean! I think this is the dish that won Susur Lee Top Chef Canada or something like that.

The dessert on the other hand, is nothing out of the ordinary.

Planning on checking out Bent this weekend. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Had a private function with family style meals. So much sauce that I couldn't eat any of it. Luckily it meant that I also didn't get sick after the meal, unlike my unfortunate dining companions."}
{"text":"The food is original and excellent. The slaw is good as is the black cod. However, you will have a migraine unless you sit outside due to noise level and the music level. Either that or you slowly lose your hearing and then be comfortable. We were unable to hear each other at our own table or have a conversation without yelling and could not wait to leave. Why a nice restaurant refuses to integrate sound baffles and noise deadening option in this day and age is beyond me."}
{"text":"The service here was so horrible, that i have no choice but to give it one star.   The waiter was absent for the most part.  It took them forever to bring the food.  The waiter kept forgetting to bring our drinks until the end of main courses.  Then he brought our bill before we were done eating.  He then brought our coffee for our desserts after we'd paid the bill.  After the first sip of our coffee, we were approached by a young staff member, who very rudely told us we had to leave because our time was up!  This was despite the fact that there was no visible line, and the table next to us was empty.   I've never had such terrible service.   While the ambiance was nice, and the food alright, nothing can make up for this, and we left with a bitter taste in our mouths."}
{"text":"We decided to visit Lee during Winterlicious and it was the perfect excuse to celebrate my birthday. We were so excited to try this restaurant after watching Chef Lee on Food Network. Our expectations were very high.

As you would expect, service was amazing and very attentive: the host welcomed us with smiles, took our coats and showed us our table. Our waiter was always present and available but not intrusive. Each dish was well presented and explained to us. It was very nice to get a \"reminder\" of what we were eating. Despite Winterlicious, they favor (and encourage)  customers to share food, so they brought us our plates one at the time. It was perfect to share and completely enjoy it before tasting the new one.

Food
In one word: FANTASTIC! Everything was perfect, tasty and with bold innovative flavors. We started with the Singapore Style Slaw (it was not included in the Winterlicious menu) and the sashimi of tuna. The slaw was an explosion of 19 different ingredients perfectly combined and brought together by a sesame background flavor (it also includes edible flowers which I love). The tuna was superb and fresh, the outside crust (just spices) gave an extra texture component.

We ordered Cheese Burger Spring Roll and Shrimp & Tofu Cakes as appetizers. the first was a asian-burger fusion, the meat inside the roll was cheesy and with an amazing combination of spices. the Tofu cake was full of flavor, without reading the menu I would have never guessed it was Tofu.

As main course we had the Bangkok Curry Beef with Vermicelli rice noodle cake and 
Jerk Spicy Pork Ribs. the ribs were good but it was my least favorite dish of the night (though the ginger-pomegranate sauce was delicious). The beef was so tender that melted in our mouth and the vermicelli cake was totally unexpectedly good.

The dessert was a trio (we didn't have to choose), the best was the fresh peach & apricot sorbet. I believe it was infused with lavender.

Can't wait to come back. it is pricey but totally worth it."}
{"text":"This is a good spot for a weekend or after-work dinner. It's pricey, but the food overall is good, and the service is very good. It is a little loud in there on a weekend evening, loud as in the music is a little loud. 

Here's a list of the best dishes: 

- Singaporean-style Slaw (don't leave this place before you try this, it's very good): you can add salmon or tuna sashimi to this, we added the tuna sashimi, and it was amazing. 

- Top Chef Green Curry Chicken

- Rack of Lamb Thailandaise



Don't waste your time with:

- Crispy Shoe String Potato: the potato strings aren't big enough to use a fork on, and not thin enough to grab with your fingers. They're awkward to eat. AND, they don't really taste good, it tastes like potato. 


Cocktails to try:

- Basil Gin Mojito: you can taste the basil and it gives the cocktail that extra kick"}
{"text":"I went for a dinner for 2 for a birthday and had a really wonderful time overall (ambience, service, food). 
The 21 ingredient sangria cocktail is delicious and one my favourite cocktails I've had :) Everyone is right about the signature Singapore slaw - every bite is unique - every flavour and texture, yum!! I kept thinking about it the next day whenever I was hungry. It was definitely enough to share. 
The caramelized black cod was great, melts in your mouth. 

The top chef green curry was okay. It's really good with the pineapple, but not the same for the bites without. I didn't really like their take on the creme brûlée dessert but that was just a personal preference (I like it pretty plain but still ordered it knowing there was more involved). I overheard a waiter mentioning to another table that you can get creme brûlée many other places and recommended trying something new - guess he was right! 

I'd definitely go again to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"To preface this review, you should know that I'm a huge Susur fan... top chef master ftw! So be warned, I am slightly biased. 

I walked into Lee Restaurant on a Saturday night without reservations and got seated in what I think was Lee Lounge, at one of their bar tables with the high top stools. It didn't matter to me because we still got to order the same food. 

The ambiance was nice, tons of people all around including families, young adults and old adults. I actually really enjoyed the music - hello flashback mid 2000 hip hop. 

I ordered:
- singapore asian slaw (great flavours and texture.. make sure you order it with the salmon sashimi!)
- top chef green curry (delicious, juicy chicken)
- braised beef (melted in my mouth)

EVERYTHING was delicious. Although I do wish that the green curry had more sauce. 

The only thing I didn't quite enjoy was the service. My friend and I were served by 4 different waiters.... asking us the same thing again and again. I don't understand why they didn't communicate with each other. 3 different wait staff each dropped glasses full of drinks when I was there. One of those drinks spilled on me - thankfully I was wearing dark shorts and none of the glass bits actually hit me. But I found that to be a highly excessive number for a restaurant that should be offering top notch waiters.

The meal was expensive, but the food more than made up for it. Plus, Susur was around and came to talk to me and my friend. *heart flutters*"}
{"text":"If you've ever watched Top Chef Masters, you'll know exactly who Susur Lee is.
The ponytailed chef single-handedly caused heart palpitations among the world's occupational health and safety fraternity when he darted around the kitchen without shoes while competing in a Quickfire Challenge in the show's second season.
Although his kitchen etiquette raises eyebrows, Lee has become the posterchild for Asian fusion cuisine.
Given all the plaudits, I decided a trip to his eponymous restaurant in Toronto was a must during my weekend getaway to Toronto. Given that my trip coincided with Winterlicious, it was a win-win situation.

We started our meal with the curiously-named cheeseburger spring rolls and Szechuan hot and sour soup.
Within 15 minutes, the playful cheeseburger spring roll dish arrives at our table and at first glance, appears to mimic a deconstructed cheeseburger.
A single plump-looking spring roll laden with mayonnaise sits on one side of the plate, while a lettuce wrap and assortment of pickles rests on the other.
While we welcome the attempt at encouraging diner participation - our server instructs us to wrap the lettuce around the spring roll - the dish can only end one way, and that's badly.
Needless to say, it soon becomes a messy affair and we resort to licking our fingers to savor the succulent beef juices and chili mayo that seeps through.
The spring roll is generously filled with minced Angus beef and aged cheddar and although it is too salty for my liking, exudes a delectable crunch that makes me weak at the knees.
The richness of the spring roll balances perfectly with the sweetness of the pickled daikon and onion, while the creaminess of the chipotle mayonnaise imparts a subtle spicy kick.
The dish is solid but before I know it, I'm staring at an empty plate. Surely, it wouldn't have hurt if they provided at least one more right? I mean, the spring roll looked so lonely on its own!

Our other appetizer is the much-vaunted Szechuan hot and sour soup. The dish is presented to us in a cute, authentic stoneware pot and the pungent smell is palpable.
Unfortunately, the dish is a major disappointment. The soup has a strange consistency and is so gloopy, it seems as though the kitchen accidentally dropped a whole box of cornstarch into the pot.
The gelatinous broth fails to strike a balance between hot and sour as it is two degrees too salty and way too generous in its sprinkling of black pepper. Meanwhile, the array of shredded vegetables, i.e. red bell peppers and bean sprouts, are pulverized to the point where they don't even resemble anything.
However, the dish is partly saved by the slices of Chinese donut fritters that sit atop the soup. The crunchy, delicious morsels add texture to the otherwise ordinary broth and nearly become the plate's saving grace.

For our entrees, we both choose the green curry chicken with sweet pea polenta, oven dried pineapple, spicy tomato jam and chili mint chutney.
It is an exact replica of the dish Lee cooked in an elimination challenge on Top Chef Master and was deemed so successful, he was awarded 19.5 stars out of a possible 20, which is the highest ever score in the show's history.
The dish is beautifully presented, but we soon discover that looks can be deceiving and the plate is again let down by poor execution.
The chicken thigh pieces, oven dried pineapple and green curry are so sweet, they resemble the type of food the cannibalistic witch from Hansel & Gretel would feed the pair to fatten them up.
The green curry sauce is loaded with excess coconut milk and fails to exhibit any degree of heat, while the chicken, which has been lightly fried in a fluffy batter, is too tame to match the accompanying jam and chutney.
Both sauces pack a punch and taste wonderful on their own but when combined with other elements on the plate, the flavors are simply out of kilter.
The sweet pea polenta isn't much better either. In fact, I can literally count the number of peas present in my two-inch by two-inch square on one hand.

{"text":"i was impressed by the impeccable service and attention to flavors.  i had the 3 course winter menu.  started with the cucumber salad, then had the salmon entree.  i ended with the panna cotta.  the salmon was cooked perfectly, slightly raw in the middle.  my dining companions weren't familiar with susur and gave their meals two thumbs up as well."}
{"text":"Went there for a Holiday party in November 2014. Absolutely amazing restaurant. Pricey, but worth every penny. Unique food combinations. Very upscale place. Great service. Really amazing experience. Everything tasted incredible and presented beautifully. 
Writing this review because I was very disappointed to see that Toronto Life's Best Restaurants 2015 Edition gave this restaurant only 3 stars. I was in pure disbelief. 
This is a 5 start restaurant, hands down. 
Will most definitely go back there, and 100% recommend to others."}
{"text":"I was sadly disappointed. Susur Lee is one of the most well-known chef in Toronto. I was expecting great thing. The food was good but it was not great consider the price you are paying. It was not much better than any good chinese restaurant, so..why are we paying 3x the price?

A friend tried the sister restaurant, Madeleine and like it. I'll definitely try it, and, hopefully, have a better experience."}
{"text":"O!M!G!  That was incredible!  Besides Hearth (NYC) I have never received such meticulous, kind, and knowledgeable service.

The 5 dishes we shared were enough for the eyes but too much for the tummy.  A little was left from each dish.  We could have ordered just 4 and been perfect.  But how do you decide what to turn down!?  Some sauces were decadently rich.  The slaw was brilliant tossed fresh at the table.

Please go!  Try everything!  Your only regret will be you couldn't try them all...in one visit ;-)"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Tried the singapore slaw (something you cannot leave without having), lobster ravioli (huge chunks of lobster meat in every bite), cheese burger spring rolls (melt in your mouth), and the special of the day: shrimp tempura . All amazing."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant. The slaw is perfect in every way. A great and innovative menu."}
{"text":"Too much theater, not enough food. Came with a party of 9, which was definitely too much for Lee. Food came in teaser size appetizers over a span of an hour and a half. Leaving you hungry at the end of the night...wanted to order more but the kitchen closed at 10:30, without notice. We literally had to get pizza after the fact. To top it off, they completely forgot an order of alcohol for the table. The food was a little above average, but the service and everything else was way below. Maybe for a party of 4 or less, but would not recommend to anybody I like."}
{"text":"My favourite dish would be the 28 ingredients slaw, we ordered everything the waiter recommended, the curry chicken, the peking duck, the shrimp. Overall I thought it was good for an upscale Asian restaurant. At such a well renowned restaurant, i think service could definitely improve, our waiter was efficient but there was no enthusiasm."}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricy but the food is wonderful. Their slaw as well as just about everything else on their menu is so yummy. Their cocktails are pricey, but their gin (hendrick's) and tonic has little slices of cucumber and is very refreshing. Great place for a date or if you were going out with bunch of friends and wanted to try a lot of different dishes. They do a lot of sharing platters or platters that you can share rather than a plate per person so a great place to be with your friends."}
{"text":"Bloom is off the rose. Flavours overdone and heavy-handed. Fatty.  Heavy.  Blunt.  They're now just milking the cow."}
{"text":"I'm amazed that even after a year, the excellent quality at Lee has not changed. We made the mistake of having 8 people with RSVP for dinner anywhere on king west! We decided to pop in Lee to check and the staff were courteous and opened up the private room for us!! Next time you have dinner with clients, definitely consider the private room here! You get to walk thru the kitchen into a quiet stately space. It's great for conversations and feeling comfortable.

Ok so onwards to the food. Everything we ordered was solid. Started with the amazing Singapore slaw, the famous top chef curry chicken (still one of my all time fav dishes), duck done in multiple ways (Peking duck was delicious)! Scallops, braised beef, gosh I don't even remember the rest. Desserts were heavenly too. I love sharing portions and trying a little of everything. The food all came out on time and the wine was poured with the right pace. 

Honestly you could never hope to have this quality of food and service for the price anywhere in the city. I think it was about $500 all in for 8 of us. Everyone at the table was incredibly stuffed and happy and I'm definitely going to come back."}
{"text":"Customer service- 5/5. Happy with the service. Everyone was very attetentive, they changed our plates 3 times, glasses of water was never empty.

Food-4/5. We ordered 5 dishes.
1. Singaporean style slaw. Best salad Eveerrrr! Very tasty. First bite was like Christmas in my mouth. I wanted to eat the whole plate but I had to share just like what mama taught me ... and yes my mama was there. Lol.
2. Cheese burger spring rolls.  Was alright. There was something about that I didn't like, maybe the onions on top ( if that was onions ) or the cheese, not sure what it was that didn't sit quite right
3. Shrimp Ravioli with lobster- lobster was flavourful. You can definitely taste the shrimp in the ravioli. Spinach and some spices on top of the ravioli made it extra special.
4. Slow braised beef- Excellent. Mashed potato was creamy and moist. Beef was tender and flavourful 
5. Malaysian strip loin (special of the day)- every bite was heaven. Never had a steak with this much flavourful before.

Coctail was really goooood! 
We didn't have room for dessert."}
{"text":"The food is simply amazing. Inventive, beautifully presented, and absolutely delicious. I had the Singapore Slawwith tuna sashimi as a starter, and although the menu states the slaw is for two, the staff offered a single portion without me even having to ask (single diners unite!). The slaw was a behemoth of a tower - a nutty slaw beautifully constructed. The sashimi was great too, though I'm no expert.

Next was the Thai Lamb. Simply the best meal of my life. The two sauces (if I remember correctly one was carrot & coriander, the other chilli & mint) went together perfectly. The bed of red lentils were delicious and the rack of lamb expertly cooked. Some veg would have been nice, but other than that - perfect!

The dessert was great too - chocolate & hazelnut tong yeun (rice dumplings). Like chewy chocolate candy. Extremely rich but great for it.

The cocktail menu is great too. Must recommend the chilli and cucumber tequila Martini. Never had anything like it!






Finally, the slight negative. I was on holiday in TO alone, and had heard about how amazing Lee is, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Being a lone diner in a restaurant can be an awkward experience at the best of times, but I was offered a seat at the bar to chat with the barman or my own table to have some privacy. Big tick straight off, a choice is always nice. 

I chose to sit at the bar since it's always nice to chat with locals. However at times the barman was incredibly patronising, for example, when placing my order he said \"Great! That's exactly what I ordered when I ate here alone two weeks ago!\" in that faux-excited voice that service staff in North America love to use. I understand that socialising with clientele isn't one of their responsibilities, but I would much rather be left alone if their conversation is just going to make me feel even more awkward!  So that did put a bit of a dampener on my experience, but as most people don't dine alone I won't let that affect my rating."}
{"text":"New to Toronto, moved here from New York. Love this restaurant! The slaw was amazing and the service was great and helpful."}
{"text":"Easily one of the top 5 meals I've ever had, and I feel like that is saying something.

We had to go early to dinner so we weren't hungry and that was unfortunate but I can strongly recommend everything I had:

The Mexian Goat Cheese Tart  was a fantastic starter.  The flavors in this just worked so excellently together, I could have eaten it all night I think.

Singaporean-Style Slaw.  Without a doubt the best salad I've ever had, and one of the best dishes overall.  This is a must-taste if you go.

Green Curry Chicken.  I'm definitely not one of these people that loves curry unconditionally, but this was excellent.  As curries go, the flavor was pretty subtle.  This was good b/c there were more flavors on that dish you don't want overpowered.  I want to mainline that sauce.

We had a chocolate dessert as recommended by our waiter (who was excellent and made excellent suggestions).

I would probably give this place 4.5 stars due to the prices, but it was worth it, and the food was so good I'll round up instead of down!"}
{"text":"The food and service was great but we almost didn't stay after the not so friendly greeting by hostess. She didn't smile once or seemed interested in seating us after we said we didn't have a reservation. I must say for their located and what we told by friends about the service and experience, we were shocked when it was less that expected."}
{"text":"Now I know why so many people love this restaurant! This is a sharing type style restaurant. My fiancé and I ordered the popular slaw which had 19 ingredients in it (Insanely Good!). Then we had the Wild King Shrimp which had Mac and Cheese Croquette ... I have never tasted anything like that in my life. Mac and Cheese Croquette is to die for! Amazing Asian fusion restaurant! It is not your every day dining experience but great for those reallyyyyy special occasions."}
{"text":"I really like this place!

Love the food and have gone many times with great experiences each time. I've introduced several people to this restaurant and all have loved it.  

Definitely love the Slaw! Great ambiance and though the service is sometimes is a bit off, they are generally quite good.

A must try for anyone who likes tasty food and willing to pay a little for it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal.  Started with the signature slaw, followed with scallops, caramelized cod and then the award winning green curry chicken.  Each dish was excellent.  Great service.  Top ten meal for us."}
{"text":"It's been almost 2 years since I last visited Lee Restaurant so I've had some doubts about dining on a Sunday evening. However, it was a pleasant surprise to find the restaurant packed and my worries quickly disappeared as soon as I had the first bite of the famous Slaw dish as a starter. It had a beautiful presentation and the server kindly mixed the slaw tableside while explaining the dish. The crispy spicy tofu was also better than expected, but it didn't have any 'wow' factor. For the main dishes, we had the Pecking Duck, Octopus, Ravioli, and Garlic Shrimp to share along with a bottle of pinot noir. All of the dishes were flavourful and did not disappoint. The service was also impeccable, but my only complaint would be that it was a little difficult to hear the server's food descriptions over the moderately loud ambience. For dessert, we ordered the Creme Brulee and the dessert feature of the day, which were also quite tasty. All in all, it was a very pleasant experience to find Lee Restaurant consistently maintaining the quality of dishes. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to spend a bit for a nice evening dinner."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed ..I travelled a long way to try this restaurant and the food .walking in the front door the place was clean on the front part of the restaurant we were sitting on the  the second part the  restaurant ... But every time the kitchen door open we would see the dirty shelves ..and that's not a good way to have dinner while watching the dirty part of the kitchen ..ordering from the menu was not easy and not kids friendly..food was way too dry and too greasy ...had heart burn all night ..kids have to order spaghetti and tomato sauce ..but it's not tomato sauce its ketchup sauce ...bad!!!  also order hot water to  try wash down the grease ..when hot water came the cup was crack inside...PEOPLE should  ALWAYS get what the paid for!! !! in this case we did not.. So thumb down"}
{"text":"We went here based on a number of recommendations from friends. We got their signature slaw to start and are glad we did - it was the best salad I have ever had! We then got the tofu bites and the pork ribs. The tofu bites were good but I perhaps don't enjoy crusted deep fried tofu bites like others do, although the seasoning was good. The pork ribs were delish and had a perfect hot, sweet combo (more on the hot side). 

I read a review here that commented that everything they had tasted sweet - the three dishes we had all did have a sweet element to it, but that's what I enjoyed about it. Would definitely go again. 

The only negative comment I would have is when I asked for a description of a specific  tea listed on their menu under \"teas\" I was simply told \"that is one of the teas we have.\" No kidding, Sherlock. I was looking  for its flavour profile but since our server didn't know he gave the quickest answer instead."}
{"text":"The food = amazing

The service = horrible

I would love to go to Lee's every day if I could because the food was extremely delicious, plated and presented perfectly, and made your mouth water. 

The service was horrible. Now I only say this because of one server, I can't speak for any other service. But the fact remains that this one server ruined the whole experience. I have never felt so uncomfortable or appalled at this waitresses attitude. During the our dinner she was very short with us and spoke extremely quiet so we needed to ask her to repeat her self several times. Which is excusable because not everyone is outgoing or loud. But at the end of the evening when presented with the bill she had the audacity to attempt to solicit a tip from our table. We had every intention of leaving a tip for her in cash that would be left on the table before we left but she felt it was her job to continuously remind us that we didn't give her a tip on the credit card. Over and over again she would say \"Do you realize you didn't leave a tip?\" \"Do you plan on leaving more money?\" \"Your friend didn't give me a tip.\" \"You know that you didn't put extra money on your card?\" 

This is inexcusable and unfortunately I have yet to return to Lee's because of this. Hopefully she has left because I don't want one horrible waitress to ruin Sursur Lee's delicious food."}
{"text":"Excellent food and vibe at this place. Little pricier options but will definitely be back for special occasions.

I took my gluten free girlfriend here and they were very attentive and accommodating, making sure that all we ordered was safe to eat. Highly recommend the Singapore slaw!"}
{"text":"A foodie friend of mine recommended Lee before I went to Toronto on vacation, so my boyfriend and I made a dinner reservation there for our last night in town. What a way to end the trip! Everything here--the food, the service, and the presentation--was top notch. 

While we perused the food menu, I ordered the raspberry mojito martini (El Dorado 12-Year rum, fresh raspberries, prosecco, chambord raspberry liqueur, fresh lime, and mint), which was sweet, delicious, and strong. We had a hard time deciding what to order because everything on the menu looked amazing, but we ultimately went with Susur's signature Singaporean style slaw to start, which our server highly recommended (for good reason) followed by cheeseburger spring rolls (smoked chili mayo, pickled veg, lettuce wrap) and a special Ocean to Table platter, which I'll describe below. The slaw came in a beautiful mountain, which they mixed at our table. Once they served it, they removed the remainder to replate before returning it to us. At first, it seemed like the size of the dish was enormous, but it's so tasty and light that we made short work of it--so many great flavors and textures. My boyfriend was the one who ordered the spring rolls, which he said were amazing (I didn't try them for fear of being too full). The seafood platter was basically a sampler that included the following:

--*Nova Scotia snow crab meat with avocado, sherry emulsion, fresh dill
--Freshly shucked Colville Bay oysters wth sea buckthorne and Asian citrus gelee
--PEI smoked slamon with yuzu and marjoram babaganoush, creme fraiche, wild acadian sturgeon caviar on squid ink crostini. 
--*Fresh scallop ceviche with salted plum and charred jalapeno vinaigrette
--*Lobster Thailandaise with green mango and papaya salad, double smoked crispy bacon, cashews, chili and lime, Myogoa ginger flower
--Shrimp cocktail with homemade assam horseradish cocktail sauce

The ones I marked with asterisks were my favorites, but all of the items were good. The only false note was the shrimp, which seemed overcooked to the point of being mushy. 

For dessert, we got the vanilla bean creme brulee (lemongrass, strawberry & gooseberry compote, butterfly pastry) and the signature French and Chinese tong yuen (warm sweet rice dumpling, chocolate nougat, Indian pastry, strawberry, crème brûlée, peach, and rosewater). Both were delicious, but two desserts was probably a little too much.

The servers were attentive without being intrusive, they explained every dish as they served it, and they cleaned the table in between each course. Our main server even gave us recommendations about where to find live music after dinner.

Not sure I'll ever be in Toronto again, but if I am, I would certainly return here for another memorable meal."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party. We all had a good time, not a problem with service or the food. By unanimous agreement the most popular was the slaw, which had plenty of textures and flavours in one dish.

I think restaurants like this have difficulty knowing whether to position themselves as 'high end' or not, and consequently try to straddle the middle. With Lee, you get quite nice food at fairly expensive prices. It was a great dinner, and I'd go back, but not an \"experience\"."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere and excellent hard working staff !
Best food I have had all year ."}
{"text":"This spot is one of my top restaurants in the city. The Singapore Style slaw is to die for and I can't stop coming back for it. The new renovations and bar placement is better than before. Also I would recommend the slow braised beef, black cod, and the duck. Can't wait to come back for more slaw :) so yummy!"}
{"text":"As expected any Susur Lee establishment, the service and food were unmatched. Something I've noticed about his restaurants is that it runs very smoothly and the staff are clearly very well trained. Never a bad experience here!

Onto the food itself, me and my mother came here for the Winterlicious menu. As typical, the menu is extremely creative and as an Asian person myself, the influences from the East are especially prominent here and infused in the most outside-of-the box ways. 

My mother got the General Tao spring rolls to start and the braised beef as her main. She is a pretty picky eater and she loved it! I had a taste and I can definitely say that braised beef is Susur's specialty. For myself, I ordered the Ocean Duo which consisted of a fried crab cake type of item and then a seafood taco. Both were very good and reminiscent of Vietnamese cuisine which I do so love. My main was the fried chicken, which had delicious sauces and juicy chicken. As for dessert, it was nothing too special but definitely no complaints from either of us.

Overall, Lee is a must-try for anyone who loves to dine out and eat Asian fusion!"}
{"text":"Truly amazing. I came here the last time I travelled to Toronto and I've been dreaming of the Singapore Slaw with Tuna ever since. It is magical....and I'm not even a salad eater. I mean, I force the stuff down my throat for weight management purposes, but I would choose THIS salad on a cheat day - it's that good! 
The lucky shrimp cheung fun were quite good as well...not too heavy but satisfying. We honestly didn't care for the cheeseburger egg rolls. It's not that they weren't good....but seemed like more hangover food and lacked the \"elevated\" style of everything else we ordered.
The mixologist who creates their drink menu was sent from heaven to create masterful cocktails. Their featured drinks are made tableside and will not disappoint. Seriously, go here for their cocktails alone. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Was there for a business dinner and we had the Chef's tasting menu.  12 dishes later, we were absolutely stuffed, but every one one of them was beautifully prepared.  My favourite was a cod dish, as well as the signature slaw.   The service was excellent as well.  Very impressive.

The only strange thing is, if you are in the private dining room- you have to walk through the kitchen to get there...but it is kind of cool to see actually..."}
{"text":"Susur Lee's flagship restaurant is dubbed Asian fusion, tappa style, but this description cannot do the food justice. It defies description. It simply is.

If you find my statements perplexing, I can only tell you to go try this restaurant. Now. Stop what you are doing and go eat at this restaurant. 

The Singapore slaw, a vegan dish, is simply the best tasting thing I have ever experienced. I say this as a person who normally considers vegan cuisine beneath contempt and red meat the ultimate experience. 

While the slaw is special, every other dish, from sliders to braised short ribs to potato chips is exquisitely good. Portions are generous, so each tappa can be shared by 2-3 people without difficulty. 

However, when I eat there, I always order a slaw just for me. No one is allowed to lay a hand on my slaw.

In conclusion, Susur Lee is a sorcerer of some kind. I can only imagine the dark powers required to make a slaw taste that good. If this were the middle ages, he'd have to run for his life. Lucky for us, it's 2016 and we get to experience his exquisite cuisine."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is solid. We had the private room in the back, behind the kitchen. It was cool to have to walk through each time you wanted to go back. There is a private bathroom too. We had the tasting menu, and the food is fantastic here as with most of his places. The waiters we had were both fantastic, and did an amazing job. We also brought some of our own wine, they have a corkage fee."}
{"text":"I was in Buffalo for business (is there another reason?) and after a frustrating work day my co-worker and I decided to leave Buffalo for dinner and drive to another country to eat. A friend in Toronto sent us lots of recommendations and I picked Lee because, well, I thought chef Susur Lee was pretty cool on the Top Chef Masters TV reality entertainment program (he was in the restaurant the night we were there).

Let's see. Where to start. First: we seemed to be surrounded by awkward first dates. That's not the restaurants fault, but it did make for fun dining.
Cool space - typical urban/modern/fusion/slightly asian decor. Is that a thing?

Food we had:
The Singapore Slaw. I enjoyed this and didn't find it overly sweet as some other reviewers did. Maybe they are tweaking the recipe? Maybe my palate was off as I was coming from the culinary capital Buffalo? My dining guest and I both said that we could eat that salad every day. 19 ingredients!

Peking Duck. Great duck and delicious accompaniments - including a little blob of foie gras. Yup. That was good.

We also had a cod of some sort. That classic cod dish that Nobu popularized. It was fine. We also sweet and sour soup, also fine.

Good wine list and the staff were on the ball. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Everything started out great. We were treated to nice patio weather on a late night Wednesday. Our waitress had a good suggestion for the slaw, which even my hubby, who hates slaw, thought this one was good. We also had couple of nice cocktails.

Then our waitress seemed to forget we were alive. We had to wave our arms wildly to be noticed and even with eye contact would get no acknowledgment of our presence or desire for service. We were going to order wine but got annoyed and left instead... after waiting for our bill and we even had to go pay at the till since they never came back at our table with the machine. At least we saved on tip!"}
{"text":"A wonderful eating experience

Singapore slaw curried chicken skirt steak and the homemade potato chips all 5/5

Asian Fusion doesn't get better than this  anywhere in the world"}
{"text":"I took my wife here as a surprise for our one year anniversary and she loved it! We made reservations which they recommended. They had our table ready right away. The inside can get pretty dark and you do sit pretty close to others so it may not suit your needs if you want a more private experience but it was just fine for us. Our waiter Mark was excellent, very knowledgeable and recommended a few of his favorites to us which we took. My wife got the Luckee Shrimp plate and I had the lobster shrimp ravioli. The luckee shrimp really impressed us it was so good! At the end they brought us a free desert to celebrate our anniversary nice touch! It's on the pricey side for sure but sooo worth it!"}
{"text":"Upscale Asian fusion spot with a patio right on King Street. The food was really good but felt overpriced. We had the Singaporean slaw which was amazing, the black cod which was very tender and melted in your mouth and the Peking duck which was just ok. The black cod was ok value for money at $34 but the slaw felt pricey at $25 (with a bunch of upsell options) and I didn't enjoy the Peking duck nearly enough to be priced the same as the black cod. The cocktails were the same story, really pricey but just ok. I'd go back for the food but not at those price points."}
{"text":"My date took me here tonight.  Excellent experience.   Alike everyone else, we loved the Singapore slaw.  If there were any food worth fighting over it would be the slaw.  I might even fight over the black cod.  It was caramelized - just the way I love it -  with some yummy flavours.  Also, I personally enjoyed the turnip cake. It seems to be an aquired taste judging by the reviews.  A taste that I have definitely aquired since I have eaten it since I was a young child.  I would definitely order these first 2 dishes again in a heartbeat.  I also ordered the garlic jumbo shrimp.  It tasted Italian to me, although I think there was indian influences.  It was served with 2 potato-like croquettes.  It was different than I thought it would be but still good.  Moving on,my date had the Peking duck.  He said it was his favourite dish, although Lee doesn't make it traditionally with the crispy skin. For me pd is all about the crispy skin.  However, the upside of the way Lee makes it is that he serves it with duck pâté; and additional touches like mango chutney.  I also had the passion fruit lemonade & chocolate molten cake.  There was suppose to be jackfruit in the molten cake but I didn't taste it at all.  It was just ok to me.  House, underground, & lounge music - loved it.  The  place was packed on a late Saturday night.   This was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had.  And I have been to Susur's restaurant in the earlier part of the century when it was twice as expensive.  When you factor in location, decor, ambiance, and food artistry, the current price is well worth it.  The Price range would only by 4 dollars signs because you probably won't want to stop eating at Lee's! LOL.  The food at Lee's was so brilliant, that I was already planning my next visit on my own while I was still eating.  Casual yet sophisticated and stylish.  6 stars. Maybe even 7."}
{"text":"SUPER DISAPPOINTED IN MAY - THIS PLACE WAS A CROWDED MESS!

I was in Toronto with hubby for our anniversary and we wanted to go big for our special weekend so we decided - on the spur of the moment - to try Lee. We like watching Top Chef and we're super foodies - so we thought why not!

WHAT A MISTAKE! We got there at 6:30pm on a Saturday and the host looked like someone had threatened him with a sawed off shot gun! We realized it's probably a busy place but it seemed even worse than that. We knew we had no chance of getting a table so we hit the bar for some cocktails and appetizers. The place only got more zoo crazy after that - it was like watching a horror film.

LOADS of people crammed in trying to get a table - the host often all together DISAPPEARING! (This was funny to watch from the bar in a sick way) From chic to geek tons of people tried to jam in there. 

I was glad we had a little bar table and thinking this was a genius move! We had beer and champagne by the glass cause the cocktails were just outright ridiculously priced. 

The decor was unique and cool- very east meets west. And to my surprise Susur Lee was there darting in and out of the kitchen, greeting tables, and SEEMINGLY terrorizing the staff! We watched as staff would go out of their way to not get near him - go around the whole dining room almost in a way just to avoid him. He smiled when meeting guests and taking pictures but at all other times seemed pissed. I thought it might be cool to try and get a photo with him before we left BUT then we had some of the appetizers and I decided IT WAS A WASTE OF ANYMORE TIME - CAUSE THE FOOD WAS AWFUL!

We tried \"SUSUR'S FAVORITES\" PEDESTAL which consisted of:
EDAMAME = Always tasty YET I could make this at home  
WHIPPED CHICKPEA DIP = Flavorful but could have easily been surpased by a gourmet store dip 
SALMON CEVICHE = only OK - not memorable or unique 
PEKING DUCK ROLLS = only good thing on the plate (probably cause it's fried?!)  
HUNAN CHICKEN WINGS = a total joke 
CHEESEBURGER SPRING ROLLS = HORRIBLE! Tasted strange and as if one too many herbs were in the mix.

After having a Cheeseburger Springroll I didn't want to order anything else ( even though I had already asked for a Singapore Slaw) I was officially turned off.

I had just had enough of the whole experience. I was turned off that the great Susur Lee seems to be pandering to the masses. THIS WAS NO MORIMOTO'S! Maybe it was an extremely busy night but the place just seemed chaotic. Like the computers were down BUT THEY WEREN'T!


I'm glad we didn't get a table - I'm glad I didn't spend lavishly on a whole meal there cause the dessert from my hotels room service was amazing that night compared to everything at LEE RESTAURANT!"}
{"text":"The food was creative and delicious. I would recommend the restaurant if you are looking for Asian fusion food in a beautiful historical space. Be sure to try the 19 ingredient slaw."}
{"text":"Went here for Summerlicious 2015, and boy, were we glad we did! 

Firstly, my boyfriend and I have been to Bent before, and while the food was phenomenal, the service there was lack lustre (a lot of waiting to be seated and for food, plus a less than amicable, but pushy, waiter). 

So when we walked into Lee, almost 10 minutes before our reservation, were seated immediately, and a charming waitress welcomed us, we were already impressed. 

Then came the food. We ordered their famous, Singaporean slaw - which we negated to at Bent, very regrettably in retrospect - and we were NOT disappointed. It was a perfect balance of savoury, crunchy, sweet, and fresh. For $22 for a slaw, we were a little skeptical, but it was well worth it, and VERY filling. On our next visits (and there will definitely be plenty more), we will not be skipping out on this! HIGHLY RECOMMEND. 

The Summerlicious starters we got were the cod fritters and jerk-spiced pork ribs. The ribs were literally fall off the bone and SO flavourful. The cod fritters were creamy, delicious, and paired with a lovely salad. Our mains were unbelievable. I got the olive-oil poached salmon, while my boyfriend got the confit duck. The salmon was perhaps the MOST well-cooked, and well-seasoned salmon I have ever eaten! The sauces on the sides were a perfect balance. My boyfriend's duck was both flavourful and tender, and again, the sauces and accompaniments were just perfect, and the tortillas were so soft! Dessert was also a hit - we loved the chocolate and coconut creme brûlée ones - the palette cleanser was just that, a palette cleanser. 

Overall, we were WOWED. There was nothing we would change about our meal, from the service, to the food, to the ambience, and even the price was right! Despite the unique fusion of flavours, everything tasted like they belonged together, was flavourful, and perfectly seasoned & cooked, with the right-sized portions. 

We would happily return and recommend! Lee definitely knows their food!"}
{"text":"If the restaurant was more spacious and less noisy, I would give this place 5 stars. First of all, if you are expecting a restaurant that is going to bring you giant, over-sized platters of food with sides like fries and cesar salads, go to Montana's and save your money. Lee is not that type of place. This is gastronomy at its finest, and Susur Lee is an internationally known chef that we are fortunate enough to have in Toronto. People who whine about small portions and price and claim the food sucks are absolutely clueless and clearly not familiar with what upscale restaurants like Lee has to offer. 

Like most I had the Singapore Slaw, which is beyond delicious. I dream about that salad and it has been a while since I have been to Lee. Spectacular. Incredible. Worth every penny. 

Drinks are incredible so splurge and order a cocktail because it will be unlike anything you have ever tasted before. This place is not a fast food restaurant, your drinks will take some time, maybe longer than your food so relax and get patient. We ordered 6 dishes for 4 people and then dessert, which was enough food for everyone. If you have a food allergy be sure to tell them and they will protect you. I am allergic to shellfish which is very unfortunate in a restaurant like this, but they ensured my food was safe and offered alternative suggestions. 

If you want to have an excellent dining experience, including tax and tip I would budget about $100 per person. If you like more than 1 cocktail or want to do the suggested wine pairings with each course then you will need a lot more money. It is worth the money if you can afford it. This is not a restaurant you will go to all the time, it is a special occasion and a place you could go once a year and splurge. Everyone should experience the genius of Susur Lee at least once in their life! This is NOT a child friendly restaurant AT ALL. Get a babysitter and leave the kids at home."}
{"text":"The ultimate date night venue! Lee is located right on the bustling street of King West. As you'd expect, a restaurant like this on King West does not come without its pricier menu so I'd say a visit here is a definitely a treat. Is it just me or is there something really romantic of a late night dinner in a dimly lit restaurant, with the perfect cocktails and shareable plates? I visited here a few weeks ago at 10 PM and it did not disappoint. Granted, 10 PM is a bit late for dinner in Toronto but once I stepped into Lee, it felt like I was in a different city (think NYC, where late dining is the norm). The place was swarming with people everywhere you looked, and more were coming in after us for food as well. Of course, the Singapore Slaw was a given must-order and it is NOT overrated. Not much I can say that hasn't already been said - you have to try it for yourself! Our second favourite of the night, which really surprised us, was the Black Cod - so soft and buttery, melt in your mouth, and perfectly complemented by the soft turnip cake underneath it. 

They had a drink cart going around throughout the restaurant which features their cocktail of the night. Nice touch! Yet another great dining experience by Susur Lee."}
{"text":"Excellent service. The food was amazing. I've heard so much about the slaw and surely did not disappoint. Will be back soon to try out more dishes!!"}
{"text":"The slaw and duck are very very good. the oyster ceaser was not. Overall a great place to go."}
{"text":"Awesome! Fantastic, visionary meal from start to finish! One of the best places I've eaten. Chef Lee is amazing."}
{"text":"I love Lee and their 40 ingredient slaw - a must try. Was there a couple of months ago and despite it being close to closing, they let us in for a late night bite and were super friendly. The food is delicious."}
{"text":"My sisters came here for a summerlicious treat and we were happy from beginning to end. 
The last time I visited Lee, it was still called Madelines at the time so it was nice to see the updated décor. The staff here are really on point. Great service to pair with great food.

Because it was summerlicious, and we were a group of 4, our waiter suggested that we get 3 servings of the summerlicious and then pick 2-3 regular dishes from the menu, that way we could have your typical family style tapas dinner. What a great idea! My sisters and I were able to sample everything on the summerlicious menu, and we also were able to try the traditional slaw...which is a MUST DO. I can't stress that enough. We ordered the green curry as well and were really pleasantly surprised with that too.

What I like about Lee is that they take \"traditional\" Asian dishes and really make them special. So just when you think you're going to get some green curry in a bowl, you don't. Truly an art if you ask me. 

Check it out for summerlicious for a bang for your buck, and I would definitely recommend on even a regular basis. You seriously pay for what you get for here.

Oh! and get the Sangria! You'll love all 19 ingredients of it."}
{"text":"Came here on a date and oh my god the food was delicious. The famous slaw of course and jerk ribs and tuna were the plates we ordered. Amazing patio seat to watch the king west beautiful people passing. Seats have this raised part of the table where you can put your drinks but can also make a difficult and awkward on a date as its a bit of a high barrier. I liked that there were cushions on the seats. The mains are a good tapas size and the slaw is huge so it was good we shared it. The ambience is amazing and the lush plants on the patio create an oasis. The server was humorous and polite."}
{"text":"What an awesome meal. Fresh unique flavors, cool dining room, exceptional service. REasonably priced. Definitely enjoyed our night out here. Would highly recommend. We especially enjoyed the singapore slaw."}
{"text":"I have been here many times with family and friends. The food here is amazing. Flavours are really deep yet simple. Our favourite by far is the Singaporean Slaw. I could eat that dish as a meal on its own. The only issue with Lee's is that prices are fairly high. If you are on a limited budget, I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"Oh my lord, this was one of the best meals I've ever had in my life! Even the vegan options were delicious. Stuffed myself on tapas, didn't know that was possible. I think I'll come back to Toronto just for Lee's. So glad our party of 6 opted for the Chef's Tasting Menu"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about his place! Everything from the menu, to the service to the decor is wonderful.

It was my first time here so I wanted to be sure to try everything including the Slaw, drinks and dessert. The cocktails were great and there was quite a selection. The service was so professional and friendly and I will never get enough of Chef Lee's Slaw-a must if you dine here!"}
{"text":"Lee is at best a 3-star restaurant I found it to be quite disapointing for a fine dining well known Toronto spot.

Service:  service was absolutely not at par -or even close- to any restaurant of this stature.  Our server, Andrew was polite and took our orders and gave recommendations on wine bottle pairings, however, after this we did not hear from, or see him for the rest of the night until we needed to pay.  

Andrew did not ask us how our food was, refill our wine glasses (nor did anyone else), change our cutlery,   describe the dishes brought to us, clean the table, basically did not do anything that would define the service of a fine dining restaurant from any other lower class restaurant. He only took our order and gave our bill to sum it up. 

Food:  the salad was good very refreshing and unique, I would recommend the salad as a must if you are going to Lee's.  Everything else we tried was non-inspiring and for the price was not worth it.

Atmosphere: they had a coktail cart with a server pushing it around the restaurant all night asking people for cocktails. I thought this was a bit gimmicky plus she was not able to make all the drinks on the cocktail lust so people still had to ask their servers for drinks (which I think is redundant to have someone bother you several times once you are seated). 

The restaurant was very loud on the Saturday night which we went. The atmosphere overall was okay, not really trendy or anything happening.

Overall for the money spent there are so many other restaurants in the area that would provide better service, atmosphere and food for the same price or less."}
{"text":"Delicious! Come with your wallet full though. We tried a huge selection of the dishes and really enjoyed most of them.However after spending lots of $$$ some of us were still hungry!"}
{"text":"I saved the best for last. I realized that I was staying down the street from this restaurant on my 2nd night in. I had been admiring the fancy ironwork around the patio area during the day when they were closed and then who do I see but Chef Susur Lee inspecting his domain and then I figured it out.  My friend grabbed us some early reservations on OpenTable and we came back later that evening. 

We started with the Saketini and the Niagra, both were tasty but a tad bit too sweet. We would have switched to wine but no one came back to take a new drink order which was the only service bobble of the evening. Because everyone says it's a must we started with the Singapore slaw to which we added sashimi of tuna. OMG the slaw is UHMAZING. Seriously a top 10 dish, so complex and tasty. The sashimi was good but not really necessary to this dish.

We then had Luckee shrimp Cheung Fun and the spicy crispy tofu. The shrimp were also really delicious. The tofu was very good but in comparison to the other dishes was just not as outstanding.

The space between tables is tight so expect to have some interaction with your fellow diners and don't let your purse almost fall into their food...not that I did that or anything."}
{"text":"Delicious! The Singaporean slaw is absolutely amazing, and so are the cheeseburger rolls. Dined on a busy Friday night and the service was great - prompt and non-invasive. Great experience overall. Would definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I've been coming here for years. Yes it is going to be an expensive meal but what do you expect from an iron chef? Service has always been impeccable. Tables are small and intimate. If all you come for is the Singapore Slaw, you'll still leave happy - although you really can't go wrong, everything else I've tried has been delicious. My favorite dessert is the Tong Yuen."}
{"text":"The Singapore Salad is often talked about it and it's for good reasons. It did not disappoint. 

Shrimp Dumplings were also phenomenal. Curried shrimp with a nice steamed pork dumpling.

Chef Lee was also in the house. Very hospital man. Service in general was great. Made a reservation in advance through open table, was seated with no issues. Server was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu."}
{"text":"Was at Sursur tonight. As always, the food was exceptional and the staff... attention to detail - amazing! Even the DJ, took our request to elevate... Great experience!"}
{"text":"words cannot describe how amazing my experience here was. my wonderful girlfriend and her boyfriend brought me here for my 30th and I let them go crazy with the menu! they are
regulars! 

we had the slaw, calamari, green chicken and the signature off the menu dish of fried chicken. i loved the fact that everything that came out, came with an explanation of what's in it, how it was inspired or made. every single dish had more than 5 ingredients that hit your pallet in a flavourful way. 

the service was absolutely amazing, I do not have a single complaint, and hand down not only will I be back but will strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"I had heard RAVE reviews about Lee, so decided to go with coworkers one night. I wasn't blown away, but it was a neat experience.

Lee is 'sharing style' so they recommend ordering a selection of dishes for the most bang for your buck. For 3 ladies, they suggested 4 -5 dishes which ended up being the right amount of food. Now Lee is not for the faint-of-appetite, it's fairly adventurous menu, so go with like-minded stomachs. 

The Singapore Slaw was my favourite - and everyone else at the restaurant seemed to agree as we saw plate, after plate coming out from the kitchen. We tried the mahi mahi tacos that were a special that evening, beef/shrimp/chicken satay (decently spicy, but pretty good), cheese burger spring rolls (meh), and mexican goat cheese tart (ah-ma-zing)! So our dishes were not phenomenal across the board, but no major disappointments.

The servers are VERY knowledgable & friendly. It's a fun evening atmosphere, just the right amount of noise & funky decor. 

My quam. The price. For what it is, I found it very overpriced. Beware, portions are NOT huge. Drinks are also very pricey - beer is the only beverage that seems on par with...everywhere else. I exaggerate slightly, but the cheapest glass of wine was $12. That's expensive, right?

Note - make a reservation, as we were quite literally given the boot at 9pm SHARP for an incoming table. 

I'm glad I went, good to get the Lee-experience, but I will most likely return to a Firkin next time 'round..."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of Lee's, it's great for a date or a night out with friends. The service was great when I came here. The food is amazing, especially it's well known Singapore-style Slaw, which is a must have. I also tried the cheeseburger spring rolls and the Peking & Char Sui Duck which were so good! I applaud chef Susur and his culinary talent."}
{"text":"Walked in with no reservation.  I was later told I had been mistaken for a canadian t.v. star.  Many people made long, direct looks at me throughout the night.  Our waitress finally asked if I was a television actor.  I should have played into it, but laughed and assured here I am no more famous than she.  The food was excellent.  The service was great.  The decor is great, but I would prefer it not be so dark.  The sirloin took quite some time to prepare and serve, but wow!  it was good.  The duck is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Make no mistake, the food was amazing. 

The service was a completely different story. 
We were a group of 8 and ordering a lot of drinks, however, they were so slow to bring them out. Literally 20-30 mins just to get drinks every time we ordered a round. 
Also, we had to request fresh plates for our next course. They brought out the food first and then 10 mins later brought the fresh plates causing the food to get cold. 

In the end I would not recommend. It's just too frustrating these amateur mistakes!"}
{"text":"Higher priced but it's susur so it's allowed. But what an experience... Top quality food and a unique dining experience with a romantic atmosphere.. service wasn't wowing but they still got their 20% on a hefty bill for 2.. we definitely wined and dined because we wanted to taste it all."}
{"text":"When in Toronto it is a \"must have\" for us. From their wide variety of appetizers to their incredible menu, we have never had a bad dish."}
{"text":"I really liked this place!  The service was GREAT.  I think our server's name was Eric & not only was he wonderful, so were the hostesses, food runners, & everyone else there.  So attentive and I just found the whole staff very intentional in everything they did which I feel doesn't happen often.  We were very happy with the food, especially the Braised Beef.  I only gave four stars because it's a bit pricey, I wished there was a larger/better selection of wines by the glass, & we ordered the Shoestring Potato which was the only thing I didn't really like at all.  It was like eating potato chips with mayo & spices - I didn't get it.  Everything else FAR outshined that though - really enjoyed my night here!  Thank you :)"}
{"text":"The Singaporean style slaw. 

Just go. Try it. And you'll understand.

If the service and the other dishes had stood out more, I would have given it a 5 just because the slaw blew my mind.  Unfortunately, the waiter was relatively inattentive since we were dressed like typical students, but that's not much of an excuse. 

I had the butternut squash soup, mahi mahi, top chef green curry chicken, and miso cod with panna cotta for dessert. The butternut squash soup was excellent, but the other dishes were less memorable.

Except. The Singaporean style slaw. It consists of julienned daikons and carrots, various sprouts, taro bird's nest, crispy egg noodles, flower petals, and a whole bunch of other ingredients tossed with a signature plum sauce and crushed peanuts. It was possibly the most delicious thing I've ever tasted, and with no meat at that! The flavours come together splendidly, and the blend of textures, from the crispy bite of root veg to the brittle crunch of taro to the yielding crush of peanuts... It's hard to keep track of what is going on your mouth, possibly because it was so good it was like I had munchies. Mind blown.

I will go back, better dressed next time, and ironically get just the slaw."}
{"text":"I personally call this restaurant \"Restaurant\" as the only sign outside the building says restaurant. no where does it say Lee Lounge, It has a very nice decor. Went tapas style. 

Singaporean style slaw- 4/5yummy, nice presentation
Asian-style Salmon ceviche- 3/5
Korean style skirt steak-4/5"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in my life. It was a true culinary experience with highly creative dishes. I felt like I was eating culinary art. They attend to every single detail here, from the food to the service and ambiance, in order to ensure a perfect dining experience. Yes it's expensive but they really do try to ensure that you get what you pay for, and more."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. In short: poor service, mediocre food, and not handicap friendly.

Service was incredibly slow. We arrived on time for our reservation, and we were told to wait at the bar because our table wasn't ready. We were there for quite a while, and another couple came in and got a table before us.

I gave my coat to one of the ladies at the front, and instead of hanging it, she was just holding it while checking the computer and answering the phone. She dropped it on the floor and stepped on it. Then, she gave it to her colleague who also dropped it, and then walked around the restaurant dragging the bottom of it on the floor!

We had already seen the menu while waiting and told them we were ready to order, but our server was nowhere to be seen. After finally ordering, we waited a long time for our appetizer. Two men who came in maybe 45 minutes after us were seated on the next table over, and they were getting special treatment by 3 servers simultaneously brining them their dishes. They already had their entrées while we were still waiting for our appetizers. We were dressed elegantly and we were quiet and polite, so I don't understand why we were getting a different treatment. At least they servers were prompt about refilling our waters, and they were friendly--but getting our dishes took forever.

The food was alright, but not worth the price. We only had the prefix winterlicious menu without drinks, which came to about $120 for two. I was expecting something special for that price, but it was quite mediocre.

As we were putting on our coats to leave, we notice an elderly gentleman with a rollator walker was standing at the front door, and was being completely ignored. There was a ledge at the entrance, and the two sets of doors didn't have handicap buttons, and none of the staff bothered to help him get in! My husband and I helped him get instead."}
{"text":"Amazing, unique, flavorful and exciting blend of ingredients. The signature slaw is a must. Fresh ingredients and lots of them! Perfect balance of texture and taste. The sashimi was a great accompaniment. The cheeseburger was a fun addition to the menu and enjoyed by all. Thai Satay, garlic shrimp were perfection. Only slight disappointment was the black cod (we didn't like texture or sauce as much as other entrees) , the wait and the service was a little disappointing but we would come again for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Susur is a Jedi!

For 2 people, you can probably order 3 items and be satisfied, but go with 4 (cause everything is just so damn good). 

The Singapore slaw off-da-hook incredible. 
Cheeseburger spring rolls - mmmmmm. 
Jerk chicken - yum yum yum. 
Braised short ribs - amazing. 
Black cod - holy crap it's tasty. 
Tong Yuen Dessert - the perfect way to end the meal. 


Eat here. For 2 people you're probably gonna drop $125 (depending on how much you drink) but its worth it. You're getting some pretty amazing and beautiful food. 

Not the best place for an intimate dinner because it gets so loud, but it's perfect for any other occasion."}
{"text":"This was one of my best food experiences of the year. This place is heaven! We didn't have reservations, so we arrived early and sat at the bar. I strongly recommend reservations because the place is not big.
The menu features small dishes to share so you can try a lot of different things. We started with the Singapore slaw, that everybody raves about it. It was very tasty but it did not blow my mind like the rest. After, we had the salmon ceviche that comes in individual spoons drenched in a really tasty citrusy sauce. Very delicious! Then, we had lamb chops served on top of a lentil curry that was amazing. I dream about that lentil curry. We also had the tiger shrimp with a garlicky sauce. Now the dessert blew me away. It was like small dim sum dumplings filled with chocolate ganache, coconut, hazelnut, peanut and sesame. AMAZING.
The place is not cheap but it was worth every Canadian cent of it! I would go back to Toronto just for that place!"}
{"text":"Note:  We finally decided to try out the restaurant after the owner has finally stopped docking servers a portion of their tips.

The food was fantastic (We only ate vegetarian options, so the review is a little limited).  We had to have the famous Singaporean Slaw.  Terrific.  The Spicy Crisp Tofu was the number one choice for both of us.  The third dish was the Red Curry Gratin.  Fairly plain compared to the other dishes, and a generic red curry dish that could be found in really any Indian restaurant.  We finished up with the Mexican Goat Cheese Tart, which was okay but not worth the 20 minute wait.

The wait staff were very knowledgeable and attentive.  For two of us with drinks and tip the bill came to $165.  I'd say worth it."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Susur Lee and this restaurant has been on my \"must eat here\" list for a while! Getting reservations for 2 a few days in advance for 8:30 was no hassle at all.

We were a few minutes late (darn King and Spadina construction) and the staff were pleasant and courteous. We were promptly seated and given a thorough explanation of the style (its a sharing plate place).

We ordered the slaw, scallop, and slow braised beef.

The slaw comes to your table and the waitress will toss it for you and explain all 16 ingredients (maybe 19 but I stopped counting). It was fresh, delicious, great texture and very filling!

The scallops were good but there were 3 for $26 - pricey. The slow braised beef was also good but I prefer the one at Bent better.

For dessert we got the French and Chinese Tong Yuen - delicious little rice dumplings filled with chocolate and nougat and nuts - little bites of heaven.

Overall I thought the food was good, but not great. The service however was excellent! Extremely attentive servers who didn't rush you at all. The food was well spaced apart. Definitely go and order the slaw... you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Decided to visit Lee's for Summerlicious 2012, as my sis highly recommended it. This place is chic and I loved the decor. We ordered the watermelon salad, Singapore slaw, green curry chicken, braised beef and creme caramel with rice pudding. The watermelon salad was delicious and refreshing. Came with some charred jalapenos on top to add a lil kick to the salad and the balsamic dressing/glaze provided the perfect balance. 

The Singapore Slaw - phenomenal! As with Deena E.'s review, I wouldn't order the tuna on the side with it again. I was amazed by how balanced this dish was notwithstanding its long list of ingredients! 

The green curry chicken was good, but I found the chicken a little tough and dry for a restaurant of this caliber. The braised beef was delicious and tender - could have eaten it with a spoon! The creme caramel desert was good although my date didnt quite enjoy the black rice pudding side. I liked it however, as it provided a contrasting texture play to the dessert.

The service at this place is outstanding! Yes,  you do get served by several different staff, but they are all attentive and I had a great experience. During our dinner I dropped my napkin and was unaware of the fact, until our server came by with a fresh napkin for me! That action speaks volumes about service and attention towards its customers. As a bonus, i also got to meet Susur!"}
{"text":"Had reservations but my date was late so when we got to the venue chef's son told us we'd have to wait and that he'd try his best. Actually, he said something else but it was so soft I didn't actually hear him and just said yes to whatever he suggested. Got a seat on the inside very quickly (originally reserved the patio) right by the bathroom staircase but didn't mind. 

The place is pretty small and seats are packed tight. Had a guy who was seated on the table behind me literally push my chair (accidentally) forward when he got up as there was no room but yet it was tolerable. 

Had been meaning to try this place after hearing some good things. Of course the Singapore slaw was mandatory and Delish! Cod was also very impressive. However, my date got the crab and it was apparently awful! The dish was soggy, possibly refried or not fried at a high enough temp. There was a wrap around the crab between the batter and the meat which was a strange texture and complete surprise. We did not eat much of that at all. 

My date and i both got the sangria and it was SO good! There were so many ingredients but they all worked really well. Highly recommend this!!! 

Staff was very good at explaining each dish, allowing opportunity for pictures and friendly. Had to wait a bit on the water being topped off though on a few occasions. 

Since it was my birthday we got the \"Ferraro Rocher\" on steroids (as my server described it) dessert which arrived with some \"Indian\" sweets on the side, sauce and chocolate on a few spoons. It was awful. So awful that my date and I nearly spat it out and couldn't stop laughing at the faces we were both simultaneously pulling. I'm a chocolate lover and not picky but a bit disappointed. Not sure what was Indian about the dessert either - equally awful combo. Gave it (technically they asked cause they were so drunk!) to the rowdy group of frat boys who were sat next to us and they loved it. 

Overall, it wasn't a horrible experience even though some of the food was well below average, I would likely return for the sangria and cod, slaw and perhaps try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night (with a reservation) and the restaurant was full.

Pros:
- Hostesses were very helpful
- Signature salad was great.

Cons:
- Pricey for the quantity offered.
- Loud (hard to communicate)
- Ambiance was lacking for a pricey restaurant.
- Service was slow.
- Tables are bunched up."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Yes it's expensive but the food is well worth the high price. The signature dish is the Singapore Slaw... Which is a must have for first timers. I had the braised beef, which was really good. My hubby enjoyed the garlic shrimp. My only regret is that I didn't have room for dessert."}
{"text":"Among Toronto's vast plethora of must-eat destination lies Lee's restaurant, the Toronto brainchild of Master Chef Susur Lee. Located in the bustling, hip and trendy King West neighborhood, Lee's is a fine example of Toronto's diverse and world class cuisine. 

Lee's lounge area was once Madelaine's, Susur's former restaurant. The two restaurants were successful yet they operated separate kitchens and different staff, it simply made sense/cents to combine the two.

Lee's interior design is sexy and the ambience commands a younger professional crowd. The Asian and French inspired dishes scream freedom as they place highly successful modern twists on old classics. The Singapore Slaw is the most popular dish on the menu and for good reason, it will change the way you see salads. Boasting 19 different ingredients from edible pansies to rice vermicelli it is visually stunning with notes of sweet, savoury, spicy, crunchy and brought together with the game changing salted plum dressing. If you decide to add salmon sashimi to this dish do not be surprised when everyone else around you is adding seared tuna. 

The Hunanese lobster ravioli with XO sauce and butternut squash purée is a perfect example of Asia and France colliding on your fork. Susur is a master with pairings and many of his dishes examplify strokes of genius. The cheeseburger spring roll is exactly what it sounds like. As odd as you may think it sounds, do not beat yourself up when you have weekly withdrawals from it. 

The Peking & Char Sui Duck is a play on the famous dim sum classic whereby you fill steamed mini tortillas with delicious duck meat, crispy skin, hoisin sauce and julienned vegetables. Only at Lee's, toppings such as red pepper jelly and foie gras pate make their way into the mix. 

The menu is put together with experience, worldly knowledge, sheer talent and execution. This even spills over to the cocktail menu. The Oyster Caesar has twice as many ingredients as most and is perfectly balanced, for that reason it tastes twice as good. 

Lee's is the perfect venue for a night out, drinks, first date, business meeting or full on feast. Always a chic crowd and always consistent... make a reso."}
{"text":"This place is just too good not say something. Have never had anything but amazing food and service every time I come. One of my faves in Toronto."}
{"text":"When you're at Lee, it's all about the fusion! I've been here a number of times, so I've been lucky to try almost the entire menu. My hands-down favourites are the cheeseburger spring roll and the Singapore slaw - I've had them every time I've been here! The peking duck is also very good. They serve it with foie gras and it goes really well with the rest of the dish. 

It's a very nice and trendy restaurant. Definitely a fun place to have dinner and would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful evening.  The service was great.  Chef Lee was in house and selected the dishes for our table.  Honestly, I could have been completely happy with the delicious table side prepared cocktail perfection and the Singapore slaw.  I'm not sorry that I ate more than I should possibly consume.  It was a most delicious adventure!!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is the best summerlicious
Restaurant I ever went. They are amazing! I have tried Canoe, sassafraz, Fred's not here and auberge du pommier in recent weeks. Lee is still the best among all of them!! Or maybe because I have a Asian stomach? Hahahahaha. My friends and I had a really great time in Lee. We chose 4 meat courses + 2 plates desserts  (three each) from summerlicious menu+ Singapore slaw + black cod.  Four of us sharing all the dishes and we got so full. They are super delicious!! Plus the waiter here are really nice! I will definitely come back again! Believe me, their food worth the money!!"}
{"text":"After having been to Bent we had pretty high expectations for Lee. We had reservations and went around 9pm on a Friday. Upon arrival we were taken right to our table.

We had the signature Singaporean Slaw which was insane good as always, literally the trip down to King West would be worth this slaw alone. I had it at Bent as well and it was just as incredible both times. We also had the oolong and lemon edamame which came with soy beans on the side, going back and forth between the 2 made for an interesting flavour combination but was probably the week point of the meal. Lastly we had the crab chorizo maki rolls, these were unexpected but mind blowingly good. We were so stuffed we didn't have room for dessert, so we will have to return for the tong yuen.

For drinks I had the raspberry martini which was great, my partner had the banana kiwi sour which was so incredible I had to order another for myself.

The service was good but nothing memorable.

My only real complaint about here is the same as when I went to Bent, it's nit picky and not an enormous deal but worth mentioning that both times our drinks were beat to the table by every single one of our main dishes. Which is a bit of a nuisance when you're eating something spicy, but obviously the cocktails aren't simple and do take time to make.

Overall I will be returning soon and was almost shocked that all of that food and drinks came to less than $120 tax in. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent...every dish we have ever had is not only excellent...but beautiful.  Decor also very cool and unique.  One of our favourites."}
{"text":"I must admit, I didn't know much about Chef Susur's history until yesterday when two of my girlfriends decided that's where we needed to go for a much deserved holiday dinner together. As to not look like a fool, I Wikipedia'd him and read all about his accomplishments. I was quite impressed.

Upon entering Lee, I was impressed with the atmosphere. The photos on the web site were a bit deceiving. It was cozy and I know this seems ridiculous but I loved the temperature of the restaurant. (For the ladies, the servers were the best eye candy I have seen since Dos Caminos in NYC). 

We ordered 5 items off the menu and each were quite delicious and filling, my favs would be the Orzo and the braised beef. The Mussels were seasoned quite well too. 

Their Wine list was remarkable and the servers were quite wine savvy (you'd be surprised at how many restaurants have servers who know absolutely nothing about the wine list)

Overall, I would say this restaurant has won me over and will become a staple in my future dining experiences. 

One suggestion - make reservations and follow up a few times with them. The people taking the reservations were a bit flighty."}
{"text":"We were lucky to secure reservations at Lee for the 9pm seating at Lee on New Year's Eve.  We called the night before to see whether they had space and were pleased to secure a spot when most other places were booked up.

Perhaps because it was New Year's Eve, seating was tight, but conversely, this made for a very warm and festive atmosphere.

There was a set menu for the evening, at $85 per person.  The value was good, as there were four courses and we all left feeling more than satiated.  Because we were a group of four, the server did a good job of ensuring that we all were able to try a bit of everything from the menu, and served it so it was conducive to sharing amongst ourselves.

The first course was the Singaporean style slaw, which is a regular menu item for Lee.  The portions were generous, and the slaw was a super tasty combination of flavours.  

The second course was a choice between soup or scallop appetizer, but as mentioned, the server brought out enough so that each couple could try a bit of each.  The soup was a smokey tomato bisque, and was probably one of the more delicious soups I've had in a while.  The scallop dish was not really up my alley but others at the table enjoyed it.

For the main course there were three choices, a beef Wellington type dish, a carmelized black cod, and a vegetarian artichoke dish.  Everyone at the table agreed that the cod was by far the best dish, cooked to perfection.  The cod fell apart with the touch of a fork, and was wonderful with the miso mustard.

Dessert was the chocolate peanut butter bar which was stuck into an English trifle.  The peanut butter bar was decadent, but overall it was too much dessert after a rich and filling meal.

The drinks were a bit pricey but definitely strong and unique., so worthwhile.

The service was attentive and efficient, especially for such a busy night.  I was also impressed that although we knew we had about 2hours to eat before the next seating, not once were we rushed.  The meal felt well timed and the whole operation seemed to run very smoothly.

Thanks Lee for a great meal to say goodbye to 2013!"}
{"text":"Mind-blowing. Absolutely the most incredible dining experience ever. We ordered half the menu...the cod was unreal, as was the filet, the shrimp - the cheeseburger spring roll!! Susur Lee is a genius. The servers were so knowledgeable and professional. I honestly don't even know where to begin.  If you go to Toronto, go here.  If you want to impress a date, go here.  If you are on a date, book it here.  Just make an excuse and go, it is unreal.  It isn't just a meal, it is an experience."}
{"text":"Comment for Winterlicious only.
I feel like it's pure hype! I would expect much better food from such a celebrity chef!
Being a Chinese myself, it does not meet my expectation of a classy fusion restaurant.
Starters: MILLEFEUILLE OF LEEK, WILD COD & METHI, I like the red curry sauce and this dish actually remains my favorite among the other dishes. 
HONG KONG SOYA CHICKEN & SPICED POPCORN, I think the chicken could be seasoned better, personally don't think it tastes good with the salad 
Main: LEE'S SLOW BRAISED BEEF, such a plain dish I bet any Chinese restaurant (I mean Chinese) can offer you a beef dish similar to this. Nothing spectacular about the beef, even though the server described it as \"so tender that it melts in your mouth\". 
Dessert: bad presentation. SPRING ROLL CRÈME BRULEE: the skin was too thick. PANI PURI: too sour for me. 
Service was attentive, no doubt. Ambiance was also great. Light was very dim"}
{"text":"This was one of my favourite restaurants of 2015.

Lee is a fancy, but not over-the-top formal dinner with a date or special occasion. 
One of the true \"Asian fusions\" in Toronto. *cough unlike R&D cough*

With a party of two, we tried Susur's signature dishes-

Signature Singaporean Slaw: This is by far Susur Lee's most famous dish, and it is actually worthy of its praise. I'm not a big salad guy. I like my protein. When I read about this slaw, I had a really firm belief that I wouldn't enjoy it. I mean, it's a bunch of veggies tossed with peanuts. I was wrong. Really wrong. There's something about this dish that really is delicious. Absolute must try. We tried making this ourselves after finding a recipe online and let me warn you: don't do it. Julienne carrots and cucumbers and taro takes hours. Just give Susur the $25 and enjoy his salad. 5/5. Must get. TRUST ME AND TRY IT. 

Caramelized Black Cod: This was the dish that really wow-ed me when it came to the Asian fusion part. The combo of black cod with turnip cake was such a surprising texture and taste. The flavour was strong and delicious. A favourite, even though it was a bit small as an entree. 4.5/5. 

Top Chef Green Curry Chicken: This entree was disappointing. We heard that Susur Lee won top chef with this dish. How? It wasn't very amazing. It was just passable as green chicken curry. The dish was served with pineapple, and rice cakes. I guess the rice cake makes the dish fusion, but the textures didn't compliment well. I would not recommend this. 2.5/5. 

Signature Tong Yuen: A very well presented dish. It was beautifully arranged. The process is to eat a tong yuen (Chinese translated for \"Soup ball\") , and immediately eat a pastry after  pouring the peach sauce into it. The Asian fusion is apparent as it combines traditional tong yuens with pastries and chocolate. 4.5/5. 

The service at Lee's is outstanding. The servers are all very knowledgeable about the menu and is very keen on making recommendations. When each dish is served, they take the time to explain to you about the dish and instruct you on how the dish was designed to be consumed. Great experience. We always want to come back for that slaw!"}
{"text":"Nice place, good atmosphere but the food is a completely different story.

The food may taste good to you but it is quite apparent that it is clearly unhealthy. I am quite aware of healthy and unhealthy and this is thumbs down for me. I have been there quite a few times and I always del extremely heavy and extremely full after our dinner and I don't eat a lot of food while I'm there, it's obvious that it;s all the lard and fat they add to the food.

I have closed the door on Lee. I hope they get a reality check and stop trying to kill everyone with the garbage they marinate the food in and put in the sauce. I can guarantee you that they're extremely small overpriced bite size portions are the same calories as eating a BIG MAC! Be ready to go to the gym and do 2 hours of cardio the next day."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Asian fusion restaurants in general, but Lee was a pleasant experience. Based on a recommendation from the waiter, we ordered the Singapore slaw and the duck. The slaw is huge. You can really taste all of the 19 flavors layered together but it's a little on the sweet side so by the end of the dish, I was getting sick of it so we didn't finish it. Also, we were getting too full for the main courses. I thought the duck was an interesting interpretation of traditional peking duck you get at Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"This spot turned out to be a pleasant surprise. I tend to avoid the restaurants in the entertainment district as find them to be mainly as see and be seen kind of places with the main attraction being something other than the food. 
This was a planned event and we had booked in advance. I had already scouted the menu and was thinking of ordering the top chef chicken and the dessert to finish. The server suggested we try out the banquet menu (kudos on explaining this as worked out well). We had a whole bunch of dietary restrictions (vegeterian, pescetarian) as was a mix group of diners. However they were able to accommodate all these things with individual orders for the people with restrictions and shared plates for others. The price points sounded reasonable 55,65 and 75 with the latter two coming with desserts (The price points are different on the website)
We chose the 65$ option.
The wine list is decent and hits all price points and varieties. Beer selection is OK. 
The cocktail list is exotic with a cart for the specials. The special drinks looked enticing (made table side BTW) but I didn't want to sully my palate given that we were in for an exotic blend of tastes for the food.
Singaporean slaw: great as always. An exotic number of ingredients that somehow blend together and provide a nice harmony of taste with a nice fresh tang of the dressing. Sure to impress. Top marks as a starter.
Tofu: Again done well nice blend of tastes and a nice kick to add another level of taste to this dish. 
Cheeseburger rolls: Hmm I didn't enjoy this dish. Not a pleasant combo for a taste profile they had beforehand as designed more for the mainstream tastes I think.
Cod with Johnnycakes: Hmm a miss IMO as the sauce threw it off a bit for moi. Johnnycakes didn't add much to this dish as well
Shrimp Cheung Fun: I treat this dim sum dish as it touches the heart (yes that's a literal play on the meaning of the word dim sum ;). A very sophisticated take on this dish with an exotic blend of tastes that somehow blend together and deliver. Top marks as I enjoyed it a lot.
Braised beef: I had a similar dish at their other restaurant. The meat is falling apart being braised for so long. However the sauces threw off the taste profile for moi with a sweet finish on the sauce. More of a filler IMO.
Top Chef Chicken: Was looking forward to this. Hmm didn't find it to hit it out of the park. Decent but nothing to write home about. Nice spice on the pineapple though I will try and replicate it at home I think.
Jerk Spice Lamb with plantains: Cooked perfectly rare. Lamb chops are not for everyone and I ended up finishing this dish as there were no takers. Plantains were heavy. The jerk spice isn't my fav taste profile so my view is biased. 
Dessert: We had a combo of 4 (with a lava cake for the people with dietary needs) Hmm maybe I was expecting Tong Yuen but this was one of the weakest courses IMO. The chocolate cake was dense, the creme brulee with strawberries was OK, The crepe with ice cream decent, The mango mousse and passion fruit were refreshing and one of the better among the 4. 
Courses I didn't try: Lobster & Shrimp ravioli, Tuna two way taco and Grilled octopus with pani puri were well liked. 
There was a lot of food for our group. I personally recommend one go the pescetarian way as the meat dishes were the weaker options. The service was good even the namesake chef checking up on us twice.  Nice touch and unexpected. At this price point this is a solid 4 stars bump it up half a star if you want to dine in the see and be seen district."}
{"text":"Four of us went to dinner tonight, 6:45 reservations. We were on time, were seated promptly and proceeded to order drinks and dinner. We ended up having a good meal, plenty to drink, the food was a little slow coming to us, but we had plenty to drink, and right after we finished desert and coffee a hostess came to our table and told us another party had a 9:00 reservation and they need our table. We felt like we were being accused of malingering, when we were quite the opposite! And this was after spending $500.00 on dinner for 4 people! We complained to the manager, Seth, who offered to try to find us a space at the bar (very crowded) and buy us a round of drinks, but a bad taste was already in our mouths and we left feeling rushed and insulted."}
{"text":"With high hopes of seeing Susur, we ventured out to Lee for dinner. We were seated at table for 2 which was a bit too close to other couples, but not a big issue.

The$35 Winterlicious menu had a good selection so we selected the Lee's pot stickers, ginger crusted Mahi Mahi and the chocolate banana cake with wild blueberries. We also ordered the Singaporian-style slaw and the Top Chef Green Curry Chicken.

The best part of our meals were the beginning and the end.  Absolute best dish was the slaw, by far. It's fresh, crunchy peanut texture and very flavourful dressing tasted amazing. The pot stickers were OK, nothing special. We also found the Mahi Mahi to be a bit bland. It was accompanied by a aloo ghobi croquette which added some flavour. The green curry chicken wasn't too outstanding either.  

Highly recommend the chocolate banana cake with wild blueberries. All of the flavours work nicely together.

Service was fantastic for us - the waiters were very attentive with water refills and re-folding napkins when guests left the table. They also described all of the ingredients in the dishes, as they were delivered to our table. 

No glimpse of Susur Lee but when we go back next time, we'll splurge on the slaw again and try some new dishes."}
{"text":"Impeccable service -friendly server, lighting/relighting of our mysteriously extinguishing candle, brushing crumbs off table etc- in a trendy, somewhat noisy atmosphere on a Friday night. 

The signature slaw is fine, but frankly, I've had pretty good slaw at, for instance, Urban Herbivore: it's shredded carrot/radish etc. with peanuts and vermicelli and a light dressing, and at $20, I think it's way overpriced, as is the whole experience e.g. a $13 dollar glass of wine - cheapest on the menu - would be $8-$10 elsewhere..  The crispy tofu was good, though overall left the meal somewhat hungry - admittedly we only got two of  3-4 recommended dishes -  and at a total bill of $85 for two including tax/tip/wine, I can't say that I was disappointed but not sure that it's a place I\"d return to."}
{"text":"One of those special dining experiences! Chef Lee was in and his tasting menu was rediculous in the best way possible. Service was attentive and pleasant, wine recommendation was on point... All in all very impressive. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates good food. Meeting chef was the icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"Went to Lee Restaurant for our anniversary. Got the Singaporean slaw as the appetizer and it was mouth watering. Mouthful of flavour!! We also loved the Tuna Tartare!! Paired so well with the guacamole and fried lotus chips. Our favourite dessert was the molten chocolate lava cake. We expected it to be on the sweeter side because most chocolate lava cakes are but this had the perfect balance. Definitely an amazing fusion restaurant!!"}
{"text":"My third stop for winterlicious and by far my favourite! We found parking right on the street right by the restaurant for free. You definitely need a reservation here and the soonest we could get for a Wednesday was at 945pm. The hostess grabbed our coats and seated us to our table. Our waiter was very nice and anyone who came to serve us was extremely nice. They gave a description of the food for every plate they brought. I had the cheeseburger lettuce roll which was perfect. The beef inside was so nice and gooey and the spring roll was nice and crispy. They were so speedy with bringing out the dishes. We both had the curry beef on rice noodle cake. This was heaven. It had a beautiful taste of Indian and Asian flavors. I love getting noodles instead of rice so this made me very happy. The service was so immaculate that they kept coming by to clean up any little crumb which for me is a lot since I'm such a messy eater. For dessert they gave you all the dessert options as a trifle plus a deep fried banana in a peanut and chocolate sauce. The mango panna cotta and coriander chocolate mousse was so nice and creamy but not too decadent. I wasn't a big fan of the peach sorbet as it was a bit sour. I had a fresh mint tea in a beautiful black pot and it was a nice way to end off. The decor of this place is stunning and a perfect date spot... Maybe not the first though. They forgot to give us our coat check ticket so we had to go to the back to find it. Minor snafu and wasn't bothered. I would definitely return but might drink before as even a glass of prosecco was a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"I came on Yelp like many others to check out some reviews on Lee before I attended my friend's birthday dinner. A lot of yelpers suggested the Singapore slaw so I had that on my mind to try. 

There was a group of 10 of us and normally when I go out with groups the service is negligent and subpar, not the case at Lee. The waitress was very attentive and our orders came out quickly and most importantly, without error.

I got to try a lot of things because the portions were so large but my favourite was definitely my own order of the Spicy Jerk Pork Ribs. They were delicious. Like finger lickin' good!! A friend st the table got the Slaw which was to die for. Now I'm recommending it LOL

The food was superb but most of my rating is because of the service. The waitress and waiters were so knowledgeable and friendly. The waitress that brought out the slaw and tossed it knew every ingredient. She was well versed. We were there right to closing time on Sunday and they insisted we didn't rush to leave. I appreciate the impeccable service we received, it made my friend's birthday one to remember. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Incredible food and service. Presentation of the food was so creative, with some unique and wonderful flavours. The vegetarian curry could use a little more flavour perhaps, but I still really liked it. We loved everything else. Obviously don't miss the famous slaw. Great veggie options and desert here too and a nice wine list."}
{"text":"Love this place, every time I go the experiece has been great. would return in a minute.  The staff is always helpful and courteous, food and service amazing."}
{"text":"This place is fusion at its finest. The hype for it is definitely on point! 
The whole dining experience is 5 stars without a doubt! 
To start, we had the salad which was mouth watering good!!! That says a lot from me because I am a meat eater to the core...but this is a MUST TRY for sure. It was a very lively atmosphere with cocktail stations circulating and servers constantly rotating and checking in. We had the duck, chicken and shrimp which were all amazing and worth trying 100%."}
{"text":"Amazing food and device! We had an 8pm reservation and were able to be seated immediately. Every person on staff regardless of position was kind, knowledgeable and great attitude/service. 

The slaw is truly remarkable, you have to get it....it is life changing as far as \"started\" go. Spare ribs, curry chicken all delicious.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my experience at Lee on Friday night. 

First of all the service was terrible. It took ten minutes for the bartender to make me a martini while we waited for a table.  Once we were seated it took another ten minutes for a server to come over. He took our drink orders and scurried away before we were able to tell him we were ready to order. 

When a server finally did come to take our order he was friendly and helpful, however the evening was already marred with the poor service from before. 

We had: 
The Singapore slaw - 5 star dish -- also the signature dish (which is pretty sad) but still it is very tasty. 

Cheese burger spring rolls - we were curious as to what this would taste like. (So now you don't have to try it.)  I think this is made with CHEEZE WHIZ.  SKIP THIS. 

The rack of lamb - this was cooked perfectly but under seasoned. It had no flavour. 

The black cod - made with some sort of mustard that, for me, just didn't really work.

Perhaps I am so disappointed with this meal because I have been to both Susur  and Lee back when they were their own entities.  One of the best meals I've ever had in Toronto was back in 2006 at Susur, and I've been to Lee in the more recent past and the food was always very tasty.  I really expected more from this chef. But even if I had no expectations, this was a sub-par meal. 

The ambience is nice."}
{"text":"Singapore slaw is out of this world. Definitely recommend getting a reservation a week or so in advance as this place gets busy quick."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great service, great suggestions, fun vibe! The slaw was as phenomenal as everyone says! Also recommend the lobster ravioli - to die for!"}
{"text":"We ordered from the Valentine's Day menu.

Service
I am unsure how service works but it appears to be a team effort. I read a lot of negative reviews about bad service here (and you know me, I complain a lot about service) but dude they were pretty good that night. Our cups (of water) were always refilled, someone always came up to clean the table after each meal, and the manager came to refold my boyfriend's napkin when he went to the bathroom. It was super filled that night and the earliest reservation we could get was at 5:30pm. Superb service in my opinion.

Food
Taco - The shell is super crunchy, the content was savoury (loved the avocado and crab) but only one? Lol. By the way they had like two little pomegranate pieces on the side, I almost didn't see them. Just small portions but I soon recognized why they only served one.

Tuna Tartare - Mediocre.

Baked Oyster - Holy shit, that lap cheung combination is a genius idea! This was actually my fave part of this meal. The oyster was pretty big and super tasty. Although I left it as the last item to eat, it was still really warm. Damn good.

Kobe Beef Tataki - It's like super good beef on a fried sushi lols. Difficult to describe but I had something similar in LA. Quite unique, I like how the rice was slightly crispy on the outside. The kobe beef was tender too.

Beef Wellington - My boyfriend didn't like the black truffle but was still in awe at the sauce. This dish is super filling, and I love how they made it - everyone doesn't get ONE slice; they get their individual dome of beef in crust lol. There were parts of the beef that were more tough (bleh). I honestly thought it was a good dish overall. If you were in the restaurant you would notice that every couple stopped talking when the Beef Wellington arrived, they were too busy eating.

Dessert - A little underwhelming considering that the meals beforehand were so good. It was definitely a light dessert (nothing bad about it) but I would have expected more.

Overall, there was nothing that made my experience bad. Some of the dishes definitely surprised me and I would recommend the oyster and beef wellington. Our service was very good. I do wonder why they make the seats so small, tables so narrow, and chairs so uncomfortable. For a restaurant with so much \"class\", they probably just want people to stay like 1.5-2 hours but not forever LOL."}
{"text":"Our first time there, for Summerlicious...was fantastic. Food was plentiful, and cooked to perfection. I think I would go just for that coleslaw. Wow, amazing. Our waiter, Mike, was terrific, but for a while I was thinking he might be on commission or something the way he was selling the menu. The ladies at the door REALLY need a lesson on how to be at the door. When you're spending that much money, you want to be greeted by a friendly face, and a little eye contact, not I'm WAY too busy to be bothered with you. And when leaving would be nice to  get a 'thanks for coming' These girls had no clue. But 5 stars for the food!!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty certain all of the reviews below and above mine will be Winterlicious related.  Admittedly, it's a great time to try an otherwise expensive restaurant.  Oh wait, I still spent $200 here for two!

I won't comment on the winterlicious menu as I'm sure everyone under the sun has, and it likely isn't offered otherwise.  We took our servers recommendation and had the singapore slaw and cheeseburger spring rolls as well.  The singapore slaw lived up to the hype.  This thing has at least 10 ingredients in it and is a complete meal in itself.  I was skeptical The cheeseburger spring rolls.. because cheeseburgers, but it was a nice tough to wrap them with simple iceberg lettuce and thus not making it overly salty.

So how did we ramp our bill up to $200?  We had four cocktails... They're pricey - $17-18 each, but I'm a firm believer in a cocktail before my main course (or maybe I'm a mild alcoholic) and they were worth it.  If you like sweeter tones, you'll enjoy both the margarita options.  I opted for the rye/cognac ones as I prefer more bite."}
{"text":"We are a group of 16 and we had dinner here on a Friday night for a friend's birthday! We were lucky to get the private room to ourselves and our server was wonderful. 

The review is for the tasting menu which is 10 courses and $75, served family style. 

1) Singaporean style slaw
We started with this dish and it was also my favourite. I'm a big salad person and this is the best slaw I've ever had. the presentation is great too. I'm in love and will be back just to get more of this dish.

2) Spicy crispy tofu
This was an average dish. the presentation was neat and the sauce tasty but I'm not a huge fan of fried tofu.

3) black pepper charred tuna sashimi & spicy tartare 
Delicious! the spicy tartare was my fav, i even enjoyed the tofu crisps that came with the dish because the flavours were complimenry 

4) Assam thai satay
probably my least favourite dish. 3 different meats: shrimp, chicken, and beef. 3 dipping sauces: mint, peanut, and mango salsa. I liked the beef and the peanut sauce the best. the mint chutney remined me of my time spent in India. Overall, nothing memorable.

5)  Garlic tiger shrimp
I loved this one! the shrimp were cooked to perfection and not overcooked like 80% of the times. The sauce was light and sweet, I think it was spiced tomato jam. 

6) Caramelized black cod
the cod was done right, it melted in my mouth. The dim sum turnip cake that came with the cod was nothing special and could've been more crispy on the outside. 

7) Watermelon and feta cheese salad.
I love watermelon. I love feta cheese. I also love jalapenos and olives and the mint on top. Seperately. I think I would've loved this dish but at this point i was getting full and it was probably a 6/10 on my list.

8) Top chef green curry chicken
I was looking forward to this dish all night and we were told that this was the highest rated dish on top chef, scoring 19.5/20. well, it's a really good take on green curry chicken. You should try it. I was full and was more interested in the dried pineapple garnish.

9) marinated korean style prime strip loin
I think this was done medium rare and it was very tender. The blue cheese flavour def came through but is mild enough that even if you don't like blue cheese, you will still appreciate this dish. 

10) Dessert trio
I really enjoyed the crème brûlée, so much that i cant really recall what the other two were. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and would return. I think the bill came to around $120 for one, which includes a cocktail."}
{"text":"Live just up the street from Lee (literally 2 minutes walk) and always wanted to try it. Finally got the chance a while back and it was a wonderful experience. Great asian fusion cuisine, I could enjoy the modernness and flavours of the dishes but it was also a western place I could take my parents and they could make the connections to the dishes they're used to.

The atmosphere was wonderful. Modernly designed for westerners but with Asian decor. Dim lighting made it hard for my parents to read them menu though.

For those of you that just want the quick version, food was excellent. Not always perfect but flavours are there and done nicely.
-Singapore style slaw w/salmon
-Black Pepper Charred Tuna Sashimi
-Lobster Ravioli
-Wild King Garlic Shrimp
-Spice Crushed Diver Scallop
-Top Chef Green Curry Chicken
-Peking & Char Sui Duck
-French & Chinese Tong Yuen
-Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar

Long version:
We arrive around 7 and did not have to wait to be seated.
Ordered 2 appetizers, 5 mains and 2 desserts for 5 people. Also ordered the oyster Caesar.
We had to start off with the signature Singapore-Style Slaw w/Salmon as the server told us it has been on the menu since the beginning. Definitely my favourite dish. Vibrant colours, great mix of textures from I think it was 20 ingredients in total.
At the same time the Black Pepper Charred Tuna Sashimi came. This was also well done, made perfectly for fresh inside and lightly cooked outside.

For mains we got Lobster Ravioli, Wild King Garlic Shrimp, Spice Crushed Diver Scallop, Top Chef Green Curry Chicken, Peking & Char Sui Duck.
Lobster Ravioli was excellent. No skimping on the lobster and the pasta was made perfectly and cooked to perfection as well.
Wild King Garlic Shrimp was well cooked, great flavour and plentiful.
Spice Crushed Diver Scallops were a little but disappointing however. I love scallops so I was excited to try this but although all the flavours were there, the scallop wasn't cooked enough and was still slimy in the middle. I ended up eating it anyways because it was only a little under done and edible but still, for a nice place like this I was expecting perfection.
Top Chef Green Curry Chicken was also disappointing. The chicken was dry. I know it was catered and put on a steam tray on Top Chef, but the kitchen was right there so that should not have been an issue.
Peking & Char Sui Duck was a nice finish to the meal overall. This is one of my all time favourite Chinese dishes and this was a great twist to a classic dish. After making fun of the waiter who tried to correct my pronunciation of Char Sui when he was actually way off, we got the dish and it looked amazing. The duck, sauce and buns were fresh and done perfectly any Chinese person would expect. The use of foie gras as a French influence worked really well and this was to me the pinnacle of Asian fusion cuisine.

Dessert was finished with French & Chinese Tong Yuen which seemed more Chinese to me but whatever. It looked great on the plate and each one was presented on a spoon. The taste was good, I think it was black sesame inside but I forget.
Second dessert was Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar which was more on the western side. Usually don't eat too much chocolate because it gets too rich but this worked really well with the peanut butter and great crunch texture from the cookie? Cracker? Inside the chocolate bar.

Oh yea and the Caesar was good but I've had better and personally believe I can make better.

Overall, I had a great experience, my parents enjoyed it as well. It's also great to see owner Susur Lee in the restaurant to make sure everything is up to his standard. This makes me confident that he's doing his best to make sure we have the best food. Definitely have plans to come back again."}
{"text":"Best dinner I've had in months, the dishes were so well thought out. The Singaporean coleslaw is simply a 'must order'. The textures are complex and the servings both substantial and colourful. The waitress was super nice, and though service wasn't very fast the quality was superb."}
{"text":"Of course, it is quite expensive but wouldn't say its worth the price. All good dishes but nothing outstanding or worth going back for. The service was bizarre to say the least, one server who dropped off the singaporean slaw (which btw the waiter just said i'll order this for the table and left) was RIDICULOUS! she took an awkward 5-10 minutes trying to list the ingredients, repeating a few of them, and mashing the salad ALL over our table. So much so that another server saw and came to clean out table immediately after she left - nobody had even eaten yet and our table was already dirty. She was so weird, she kept tossing the salad and then served all 4 of us! Our main server was a weirdo too, he pushed food on us, like the apple strudel at the end, couldve sworn the kitchen had a competition on who was selling that because he wouldn't shut his face about it. Not the type of service you expect at such a high end restaurant. Also not a very intimate venue, as most reviewers stated, incredibly loud and not the best dining experience. Pretty sure the big party next to us were on drugs. The turnip cake from the cod was good, the calamari was okay, the octupus was good but i think most of what we ate was good because of the glaze instead of the actual meat/star of the dish. Will not be going back there."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto and I was hungry read the Yelps for some place close and good.  I called for an order the person was nice made me at ease to placed my order, got there and the people was very nice.  A must place to go, if I'm ever here again will go again"}
{"text":"Singapore Salad is a must try, so special, you will not forget it after you tasted it.
Presentation of food was very impressive, fancy and arty. 
Waiter was very attentive.
Portions were small. 
Expensive."}
{"text":"I didn't see the season of Top Chef that the chef was on but I can tell you the man CAN COOK! Everything here was finger licking good. Our waiter was a bit unfriendly but I didn't mind since I wasn't there to make a friend. Will definitely go back next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great food, lovely restaurant, very poor service. We had Daniel who began as a bumbling server who you could feel the nerves off of. No issues until the wrong cocktail was brought to our table. Rather than taking ownership of the mistake, he accused us of mis-ordering our beverage. When we reordered the drink we wanted, rather than taking the mistake off our tab he charged us for both. 

Great food, terrible service. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Terrific overall experience.
Went there for the Summerlicious program.
The slaw, of course. Incredible.
Drinks: Basil mohito, good but pricy.Homemade juice concoction, great but pricy.
Appetizer: fried calamari, bit overcooked but tasted wonderful.
Beef: also had a wonderful, flavourful sauce but tough meat .
Salmon: really tasty too.
Desserts: frankly, disappointing (sampler of three) maybe not worth the calories!
Experience: hard to beat. excellent service, friendly staff who are very accommodating.
Listening to the ingredient list contained in the slaw as being tossed and presented by the server is memorable in and by itself.
Not your usual run-of-the-mill fare served with efficiency and care.Food not perfect but we really enjoyed the experience of dining there. What more do you want? 
 Will return. 
I recommend."}
{"text":"Had higher expectations for Lee, after dining at Bent this past summer.  I guess the reason for sky-high prices at this place are due to location and top chef Susur Lee.  The Singaporean slaw is definitely a must- it was the best part of the meal.  Plates are meant for sharing, so my boyfriend and I ordered the mini beef tacos, tuna tartar and the sirloin. Beef tacos were tiny, in a crunchy shell (I would've passed had I known that).  Sirloin came with mushrooms in a bag, and was served with gravy (odd for an Asian-fusion resto?).  Place was packed, service was good, but to be honest, we found nothing special about this place.  We opted out of ordering dessert, but the diners next to us highly recommended the chocolate cream puffs (as they tasted similar to Ferrero Rocher).  I guess we'll never know what they taste like, since I probably won't be running back to Lee anytime soon."}
{"text":"Tantalizing flavours! Susur Lee really has something going here. I wish I could've tried one of everything on the menu. 

My dinner guests and I chose the ever-raved about Singapore Slaw with the tuna as extra. The slaw didn't disappoint, but the tuna, although nice, wasn't worth the extra $10. Next, onto the fried tofu, also very tasty (a little firmer would've been better in my opinion). The garlic shrimp was delish and the dumplings as well. The AAA strip loin was just so/so... over-cooked and tough to chew. The braised beef and leek potato dish was amazing. We all agreed it was the best of the night. 

Now for desserts... (oh yeah, yes we did) selections included a peanut butter chocolate bar that reminded us of a Little Debbie Nutty Buddy snack bar (albeit, with 72% cacao chocolate) and a rhubarb-apple mini-pie with chantilly creme. The rhubarb-apple filling was perfectly light and not too sweet. The pie crust wasn't remarkable and the chantilly creme was similar in taste and texture to sour cream/creme fraiche. Interesting pairing of the sour notes upon sour with the rhubarb for a more savory experience. 

All in all, a lovely meal. Only negative regarding the ambiance was how LOUD the main dining room was - we had to basically yell across the table, but typical for a rowdy late Saturday evening reservation on King St. Also, the service was above average; however, our waiter had a bit of an attitude and didn't seem to give a crap about us enjoying the experience which was a minor bummer."}
{"text":"The best modern Asian or Asian fusion meal I have ever had.  Definitely recommend here if that is your cup of tea. 

Best salad I have ever had was their Singapore slaw with 19 ingredients. Fresh, flavorful, crunchy, crispy. 

Best cheung fun I have ever had was their shrimp cheung fun. Whole shrimp on a modernized noodle wrap with ground meat and veggie filling. Great flavor and textures. 

Their signature tong yuen dessert was good and definitely worth trying. Highlight of that was the Indian crunchy balls with rose water sauce."}
{"text":"I didn't even want to come here for dinner because it is tapas style which i hate, but I can say after trying it MY GOD it is mind blowinggggg. Amazing service, FANTASTIC food, great atmosphere.  The only complaint is that the area we were seated in was really tight and you can basically hear the next table's convo.

Started with the Singaporean-style Slaw. SOOOOOO good!!! Theres a ton of ingredients in it (i think like 18 or something?) and it all mixes together great! Tho there was a bunch of stuff i didn't like  (eg. coriander, ginger, onions), I just picked it out. The waiter will come and mix it all together for you at the table. Not sure what sauce they use but it fits perfectly with the dish.  Also, the portion is huge and u should def share this.

Mains
Crab Cake - I didn't like this, but I don't like crab cakes in general.  It's def better than other ones I've had tho.
Caramelized Black Cod - MELT in your mouth amazing. This portion was small but I guess it was expected.  I just wanted more!
Korean Style Marinated Beef Striploin -  so tender, cooked to a perfect medium rare, paired with really yummy mushrooms

My friend had the Warm Molten Chocolate Cake for dessert.  I don't like molten chocolate cake normally but I had a bite and WTF diedddd. The cake was warm, the chocolate oozed out perfectly, the vanilla bean ice cream was so good.  I was already full but I wanted to order another one to share, but no one else wanted to haha.  i would go back here JUST to eat this along with the slaw.  Really i could eat the slaw as my main by myself.  this restaurant is actually A-MAZING. A MUST try"}
{"text":"We visited Toronto, and on the advice of a friend tried this restaurant.  It is perhaps the best restaurant in North America.  The Singapore Slaw is to die for.   Everything else was amazing."}
{"text":"This restaurant is clearly run as a business, unlike many, and a good business it is.

Apart from the booking/seating problems we had a great time.

When booking, I requested a \"quiet table\" on the phone. When they called back to confirm the reservation on the day, they again confirmed a \"quiet table in the first room\". However, on arrival we found ourselves allocated to a table right in the midst of the noisiest second room. We were moved back to the first room having protested.

As everyone does, we had the speciality \"slaw salad\", and it did not disappoint. Lots of different textures and tastes - apparently 19 ingredients - and quite sufficient for two.
The black cod had a rich fishy taste, with interesting and well cooked veggies to accompany it. Again sufficient for two.
 The cheeseburger spring rolls, very crisp with a great chipotle mayo - spicy. The adjective \"decadent\" comes to mind. A small dish.
The Pièce de résistance, however, was undoubtedly, the Peking duck. It was fun, excellent, good duck, and great sauces. There was hoisin, cranberry, spectacular foie gras, cucumber, caper mustard, and ginger. There is something very satisfying about making your own mouthful.

The wine list is expensive, but again good. We had a great Burgundy (Cotes de Nuits) at $105 having brought our own Champagne. (Corkage $40). Cocktails are expensive ($17 for a Mojito) and clearly do good business being brought round and made at your table from a trolley.

The service was impeccable, friendly and well-informed."}
{"text":"This place would be closer to a 4 or 4.5 stars if not for my frustrating experience:
I had ordered a beef wellington off their specials menu. The filet was way over-cooked; parts of the filet was extremely dry, but there were also bits of under-cooked parts to it as well (you can see this in my picture). When I suggested to the server that the meat was poorly prepared, he assured me that this was how it should be and apologized for the inconvenience..

This first order had really dampered my mood for the rest of the meal, but it would be unfair for me to say that the other dishes were not good.

Singapore salad - one of their most popular items and for good reason. Very tasty and had a nice mix of textures
Lobster ravioli - kind of spicy, which is a bit weird for a dish I expected to be creamy and savory.
Peking and char sui (sic) duck - my favorite of the night. The duck breast was perfectly prepared and the make-your-own wrap style akin to peking duck prepared at Chinese restaurants was very fun
Black cod - it was served atop a turnip cake which really clashed with the flavors of the cod. They tasted very good eaten separately, though."}
{"text":"We almost missed it on the outside, but once you're inside it's amazing. We found the service to be excellent. It appears the phrase 'that's not my job' is never uttered in this restaurant. Everyone seemed to be willing to do anything to ensure their guests were having a great dinner. We observed hostesses clearing plates, managers refilling water glasses and the wait staff was running around like crazy. 

So onto the food. This was my only meal o' the day and I got more than a day's worth of calories in at Lee. Our group ordered several items and were disappointed by none of them. Here are my faves in order of preference:
1. Singaporean-Style Slaw: this was our group's favorite. It was one of the most amazing combinations of flavors I've ever experienced. The presentation with the server mixing it table-side added to the experience in a really positive way.
2. Ceviche / Baked Asian Pork & Leek Dumpling (this was a total tie)
3. Peking Duck (still really good... but the other 3 dishes were unbelievable)

We also had the chocolate peanut butter bar for dessert. I really, really recommend this. 

While we were there, Chef Lee was in the restaurant. He came out and said hello to guests and made sure everyone was having a good dinner. That was really excellent."}
{"text":"I really like the food here, and the atmosphere was nice and the waiter was very attentive.  So why not another star? It's the spiel.  I'm sorry but when I go out to dinner, it's to have a conversation and enjoy some food.  Not to talk endlessly about the food, and certainly not to hear every blessed ingredient in every dish that is placed on the table.  I'm here to eat the food, not dissect it. 

The food is wonderfully creative and I really enjoyed the chef's aesthetic, but I really dislike having the conversation constantly halted so the waiter can demonstrate that he's memorized all 19 ingredients in the salad.  It kinda reminds me Hortons Steakhouse where the waiters force you bear witness to the ingredients that will be used to prepare your dinner down to the broccoli.  It's replacing a genuine experience with an advertisement for the experience.  It's just kinda cheesy."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's sister is a fan of Susur Lee, so when she came to Toronto to visit we took her to Lee. We were definitely not disappointed in the food or the service. I sampled the following dishes: 

Singapore-style Slaw with tuna sashimi - A must-order and Lee's signature dish. I have never had anything like it before.
Mexican Goat Cheese Tart - Not my favourite as it was slightly out of place among the rest of the Asian Fusion food.
Lump Crab Cake - Fantastic.
Caramelized Black Cod - The most disappointing thing I had here. The turnip cake was mushy and I don't think it went well with the cod.

Both desserts, Chocolate & Peanut Butter Bar and Coconut Creme Caramel, were delicious.

Tip: Make a reservation, because you probably won't be able to get a table otherwise."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and the food was amazing.  This is my second time at Lee with the first visit being during summerlicious.  Because there were three of us and we are all big eaters, we got to try a lot of the dishes.  All were very good, but some really stood out:
Singaporean-Style Slaw with tuna sashimi - a fresh flavourful symphony in your mouth (5 stars)
Wild King Garlic Shrimp - shrimp was cooked perfectly (5 stars)
Korean Style Marinated Beef Striploin - to die for (5 stars)
Beef Braised Tacos - daily special so not on the menu (4 stars)
Caramelized Black Cod (4 stars)
Yuctan Sweet Corn Lettuce Wrap (4 stars)
Peking and Char Siu Duck (3.5 stars - it was good, but the other dishes were so much better, and also a little messy trying to eat it in the wrap form)
Heirloom Tomato and Beet Salad (3 stars - not my choice, it was one of my friend's choice as I am not a huge salad fan, but still tasty)

For dessert we had:
Warm Molten Chocolate Cake (5 stars)
Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar (5 stars in my view, but my friends weren't a fan of it)
Pear Tart (3 stars)
Vanilla Bean Creme Brule (4.5 stars) - it was good, but creme brule is creme brule, it's pretty much the same everywhere. 

I had a little bite of each dessert so mixing all the flavours was a bit odd to the palate, so I would suggest to eat one dessert at a time."}
{"text":"this is probably my new favourite restaurant in toronto! as soon as i walked in, the interior design had a welcoming ambiance, and the staff were very friendly taking our jackets and issuing us our table of choice. there is lots of seating space & 2 bar areas. the restaurant is dimly lit and gives a nice romantic feel. our waiter provided us with really great service. he knew what to recommend, knew all of the dishes ingredients, and knew when to come around. the menu is extensive & has something for everyone; whether you are a vegetarian, a seafood lover, or a meathead. this is a tapas style restaurant so all the dishes are shareable, ranging from 15-50$. the cocktail menu is amazing with some delicious cocktails ive never even heard of before. i got the coconut margarita and my boyfriend got the oyster caesar, we were both very impressed by the taste & presentation. of course to start, we tried the infamous slaw which blew us away! it is a huge portion and was flavourful with 19 different ingredients which our waiter was able to list from the top of his head. then we got the award winning dish; the curry roasted chicken & it was probably the most tender yet flavourful chicken ive had with hints of curry and pineapple at the same time. we also got the veggie tempura and tbh, it was probably the best tempura weve ever had, considering were huge tempura fans. the tempura consisted of zucchini, squash, avocado, and even mango and lemon which was very different for us. the 3 sauces also added even more of a touch! at this point, we were pretty full but ofc theres always room for dessert. we got the signature chinese & french dish which was pretty interesting in presentation, form and taste. its definitely a signature dish and is not something youd ever have. overall, id defs refer this restaurant to anyone whos wanting to go out for a special occasion & its definitely worth it to try the signature or award winning dishes despite the price because it will make you appreciate food, quality, & taste so much more. you can really tell how much effort the chef puts in to creating and making the food. i will definitely be back here, especially for the slaw! :)"}
{"text":"My family and I had an incredible experience! The restaurant itself is beautiful and intimate. Comfortable seating with large tables. We had several servers, all of whom were friendly and checked on us many times. Each meal was explained, our waters were always filled, and our plates were replaced a few times. The restaurant is sharing style so we ordered the signature slaw, vegan, which was beautiful, and a must order. The slaw has different textures and flavours. We also had hot and sour soup, which is unlike any hot and sour soup from a Chinese restaurant. This was my mom's favourite. I had the Balinese avocado salad, vegan, again amazing. The dressing was a warm peanut sauce which was great with the pineapple and coconut. The cheese burger spring rolls were also very good. The tuna two ways is a must order and is beautiful to look at. The samba satay was finished by my family in a heart beat. They enjoyed the different toppings and sauces it came with, especially the peanut sauce and mango salsa. The Peking and char siu was one of the best dishes on the table, recommend by the staff. Again wonderfully presented, different textures (crunchy from the crispy tofu, soft , tender from the meat, fresh from the scallion, pasty from the pate). The luckee shrimp cheun fung is again another favourite on the table and an absolute must order. Full of flavour. For dessert I had the sorbet which is made in the restaurant, is vegan, and included the best coconut sorbet I've ever had. I'm very happy they had a vegan option for dessert which is very hard to find in restaurants. My family had the molten chocolate cake (the best out of all), the vanilla crepe brûlée which is gorgeous and yummy, and a tarte which was also very good. They also have a little cocktail cart that comes around. I had the mango tango (vegan) which i recommend for fruity lovers and less spirit forward. My favourite mango cocktail by far that is decorated with flower petals. Thank you to chef Lee for coming out to say hi, and to the incredible staff who genuinely look happy and are very kind! I will be back for my birthday!"}
{"text":"Worth a try but wouldn't come again because the food is not worth the price. The atmosphere is beautiful and service is awesome with extremely knowledgeable staff that are always tending to you. 
Though the food tasted good, it doesn't make you stuffed and if you grow up around Asian cuisine many of the flavours aren't anything new. 
The calamari was a cute presentation in a popadom tasting bowl. Tasted good, but overpriced. 
The lobster ravioli was tasty as well but sharing the dish you may get 1 or two which isn't to filling. 
The tartare was very flavourful and the fish tasted fresh. 
For dessert  we shared the dessert spoons containing the Indian wrapper and filled with peanuts and other fancy ingredients. To be honest it was the flavour of a wunderbar. I like wunderbars just not for the price."}
{"text":"A definite must-try. We ordered everything off the Winterlicious menu, plus a few other things. My favourites were Slow Braised Beef Taco, Lobster & Shrimp Cod Cake, Thailandaise Ravioli (vegetarian), Spice Crusted Veal Schnitzel, and off the regular menu: Singaporean Slaw (their signature dish, and for good reason), and the duck. We shared all of the dishes so everyone could try a bit of everything. They encourage you to share.

I don't really like duck, yet at Lee it was spectacular. They serve a few pieces of duck with foie gras, crispy tofu, other toppings, rice paper, and sauce. You pretty much make your own wrap, and it is DELICIOUS.. Everything else was spectacular as well. 

The dessert trio off the Winterlicious menu:.The Tong Yuen (it looks a bit like a dumpling) is out of this world. Do not share it. Spot it immediately and eat it before anyone else notices. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"4/5 

Disclaimer: Mainly based off the Summerlicious dinner menu

Came with two friends on a Monday night. Had a 7pm reservation (easy - done online!) and was seated promptly. Ended up ordering 2 summerlicious sets along with the famous slaw to share. 

Apps (Cod & Octopus Taco // Cheeseburger Spring Roll): Taco was nice and crunchy, tasted more of the mango and papaya compared to the \"main\". The cheese was a bit strong in the spring roll, although overall it had a nice chili taste. 

Entree (Roasted Grouper // Pulled Beef Purse): Grouper was cooked well, but expected more flavor. The plantain and vegetables were a good mix along with the grouper. The pulled beef was very hearty and filling, especially being wrapped around the confit crepe. 

Dessert (Chocolate Pudding // Passionfruit ice cream // Coconut Tapioca Cake): This actually made sense as a trio, as I found two of the items to be a stronger taste (Chocolate & Passionfruit). Fav was the coconut cake as I prefer a lighter taste. 

SLAW: Definitely the highlight of my experience. If there was one thing I remembered, its that there are 19 ingredients in this dish! The crunch of the sesame and peanuts blended nicely with all the vegetables, along with a light dressing. 

Service was attentive and friendly throughout. Our server recommended not getting a Summerlicious set for each person and good thing we listened because we were stuffed afterwards. 

The summerlicious combination was nice but I think I would prefer to try more of the signature dishes in the future (such as the cheung fan)."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Everything was phenomenal! The waiter was super helpful. All of his recommendations were spot on. Must do Singapore salad of course. Plenty of veggies options for the vegetarian in the group. Desert was also phenomenal. Top 5% of meals ever!"}
{"text":"My partner and I stopped by for a bite on Wednesday July 24th, 2013 and we were very impressed with the phenomenal tasting \"Singaporean Style Slaw\", and the delicious crab cakes.  However, the \"TOP CHEF Green Curry Chicken\" was quite simply... terrible.  After eating the previously mentioned dishes we were waiting to really be wowed, and instead we were heavily let down.  The concept of spicy, sweet, and tangy should be a winner, but it fails miserably in this dish.  The bland and mushy polenta was lost in the pineapple and much-too-sweet green curry sauce, and the red sauce on the boring chicken balls tasted like Sriracha hot chili sauce straight from the bottle.  Granted, Susur was not in the kitchen that evening, but nevertheless it was $28.00 wasted on a Thai curry mess."}
{"text":"We were there as a group for a Birthday dinner.
Food was good. We had the tasting menu and we had a large sampling of dishes, including the slaw, seafood platter (oyster shots, salmon tartare, spotted shrimps), watermelon salad, caramelized cod, spicy tofu, braised pork, and duck wrap. The pork and the fish were the best, I also enjoyed the duck wrap dish very much. The company was great and overall we had a very good time.
 
But as much as the food is good, the service is poor. Staff is nice and polite, but for a restaurant that pretends to be of high standing and for this range of price you would expect much better trained personnel. For instance, we ordered a Chablis and a Pinot Noir from Bourgogne for the wine to pair with the different dishes we would have in the menu. I asked for the Pinot Noir to be opened earlier into a decanter for the wine to open and get its full aroma and tastes when we would drink it. The waiter opened the red wine, poured it into the decanter without having any of us taste the wine first and started pouring it right away into the glasses. The Chablis took too long to come to the table so we were already done eating the dishes it was to be paired with. Overall this shows a complete ignorance of wine and food culture from the staff. For a restaurant of this supposed standing it is unacceptable.
 
For me this puts this restaurant in the category of wanabees that surf on the wave of foodie trend with TV stars chefs but which in the end lack the substance of real great world class restaurants. You pay the same price than a 3 stars Michelin guide restaurant (world's top restaurants) but get a fraction of the experience.

For a restaurant that has such great decor, good food, and a famous chef's name tied to it, at the least have the staff trained on serving etiquette, please.  It's not enough to just be able to mutter the name of the dish and it's ingredients.  Bring up the bar and make it a truly enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"I decided to book my 40th birthday dinner here. I could not have made a worse choice.

Our server, Karen, was utterly clueless. I should have known we were in for it when she arrived at the table, rattled off the specials at 100mph and then fled like she'd been shot. 

We then waited a half an hour for her to return for drink orders. We decided to order food at the same time and needless to say Karen was confused every step of the way.

An hour fifteen after sitting down, food begins to arrive. Some people get mains, others appetizers, others both. I go over to the front desk to complain and another server comes by to ask how I want to handle the remaining mains and I tell her she might as well have them sent so at least all the food would be on the table (she ignores this).

Karen then returns to confront me about the order the food came in. Apparantely, I am wrong in the belief that appetizers come out first, then mains, then dessert. I tell Karen in no uncertain terms she has no idea what she's talking about and she flees.

We continue to eat...five of the nine of us finish our entire meals and then the four remaining mains come out. Karen, of course nowhere to be found, pops back briefly to ask if we want drinks. AN HOUR later my drink arrives (I'd actually forgotten I'd ordered it by this point).

Anyway...the remaining four people eat their meals while five of us (with no drinks) sit there chatting (and fuming). 

The food was mediocre. Both of the people who ordered the duck were disappointed. I'd say 6/9 people were unimpressed with the food.

I then emailed Susur to complain and got a lovely phone call from Seth who quite literally tries to convince me that the sky is green and that Lee operates differently from every other restaurant on earth and just sends out food without regard for app/main or what have you. 

Seth goes on to essentially say \"It's clear we had a bad night, but totes come again!\" and that's the resolution. An epic disaster of an evening and they were \"but come again!\".

No...I won't be coming again and I recommend you don't either."}
{"text":"Great place in a busy area - King west
Love the house slaw and cheeseburger spring rolls!"}
{"text":"Amazinggg restaurant.  Pricey, but well worth it.  Everything is a work of art and a great combo of flavor/

Server recommended 4 share plates between two people, I think 3 is more than enough, depending on what you order.

SIGNATURE DISH - SINGAPORE STYLE SLAW.  Must get, this thing is a masterpiece within itself.  It had a great mash of asian flavor, must try!!  Very unique.

THE DUCK SPECIAL - not sure if it's on the menu all the time, but if they have it, get it.  It's like Peking Duck on crack.  Taken to a whole new level, it had wraps, it had hoison sauce, it had pate, it had duck with mushrooms and the veggie and fruit stuffings.

SASUR-STYLE DICED VEGGIE CHOW MEIN - this was also a variation on lettuce wraps.  It was delicious and filled with flavor.  I don't even know what kind of veggies were in them, all of the veggies were so well infused with flavor.

Lighter mix - we tried the CARAMELIZED BLACK COD.  This was amazing, it was light and it was on top of a bed of asian turnip cake - very delicious!!!

Overall, I really enjoyed this highly modified version of the traditional asian food - yes it was pricey but omg, well worth it.  Great music, knowledgeable staff - excellent!

Yelpers, don't hate on it just because it's a bit pricier.  It's good food."}
{"text":"Off the chart flavours.  The Asian slaw might be the best thing I've ever eaten, top 5 at least!...  Everything is always amazing and I'd go back anytime!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a meal recently. Place looks great after the renovations. 
We started off with oyster caesars. Had the slaw, tuna, black cod, chicken curry and pork ribs. Finished off with the chocolate peanut butter bar desert. Everything tasted great and the server was attentive without driving us crazy.
Still a bit pricey.Over $800 for the 3 of us but half that was the drinks and wine."}
{"text":"Amazing meal! We had a party of 6 and the waiter gave us excellent advice on ordering. We had 2 platters of the signature slaw, which was the best salad I think I've ever eaten. Really fun presentation and the server reminded us to take a picture if we were interested. I wish more places would do that. We had enough of the cheeseburger spring rolls that everyone could have one. They were unexpected but delicious. Then we had several entrees. My favorites were the shrimp and the chicken dish that won Top Chef Masters. Some of us had dessert. I loved the creme brûlée. The only negatives were the noise level and the bill. We had been told we could have separate checks before we knew that most dishes would be shared. It was a new computer system and it took some time to come up with an approximation of correct division. Still, I'm very glad we chose to eat here during our visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"Chose this restaurant for our one \"fancy\" dinner during a weekend visit in Toronto. Overall we were pleased with our selection. 

Showed up for our 9:30 reservation and the place was packed! Took a while to get our drinks, but we weren't in a hurry.  I started out with the seasonal Bellini. The fruit was lychee. A little sweet for me, so I \"downed\" it and switched to Chardonnay. 

We started with a seafood platter 'special,' and I would order it again based on presentation alone! It was so unique and beautiful. We each received an oyster and clamato shooter (YUM), BBQ eel, ceviche, seared scallop, and a tiger prawn. 

Next we had the singapore slaw with seared tuna. The slaw, as all other reviewers have stated, is a party in your mouth. We could have done without the tuna. The fish was fresh, but the outside 'crust' had a strange taste to it. Trust be on this one. Let the 'slaw stand alone. 

We finished things off with the Top Chef green curry chicken, because....how could you not? It was very interesting and delicious, and I enjoyed doing my best Padma imitation as I tasted each component separately and then married them all together for the perfect bite. 

Susur was there and we caught him walking by. He shook our hands and we had our photo taken with him. So dorky,  I know...but the point is, he was a good sport about it : )

A word to the wise: Our server advised us that dishes were served to share and that 2-4 dishes would satisfy 2 people. We had 3 dishes and were uncomfortably full afterward. I would recommend 3 just so that you can taste several different things but 4 dishes would definitely be excessive."}
{"text":"Wow it was a great place. I would definitely recommend to have a reservation at this place if you want to get a table. Good food even for vegetarians the Singapore slaw is their highlight. It's pretty nice but not as awesome as they make it out to be. 
Had the goat cheese tart , really good. The samosas were an interesting change but I would give it a 2.5/5. 

Now comes the most interesting part the dessert. We ordered the Chinese dessert I forget the name and wow was it awesome . I think even that's an understatement. It has been a very nice dessert I have had i a long time that's not a cake or an ice cream. I would highly recommend to not miss this desert. 

Very good service as well you would not feel you have to wait to call someone if you need something."}
{"text":"OMG! The food here it to die for. 
I arranged a work dinner for a group of 15 people the week of TIFF. Mind you  we were on a sales trip to Canad from the States and we had all arrived around 3pm to our hotel and ready to depart to the restaurant was chaotic with soo much going on in the city. I had been working with Graylin for over a month, one of the restaurants coordinators. She was really nice and responsive. She made sure to accommodate our group. 

We arrived a little late to the restaurant, there was soo much traffic because some streets were closed. We had to be out of there by 7:30pm because we had a Cirque show at 8. We were supposed to be there at 5:30 but ended up showing up at 6. It gave us just enough time to eat. They were very particular about wanting to give us more time to eat since it was going to be such a feast, we all ate pretty quick but we enjoyed EVERYTHING. The presentation is amazing, the waiter explained every detail of our food items. We had a vegetarian with us and she had her own menu with exclusive dishes. She still raves about how amazing the choices were and that this has been by far her best experience with Veg food. 

The 31 flavor sangria is delicious, the Singapore Slaw everyones favorite. My boss loved the cheeseburger rolls and everyone else had others to rave about. 

On our way out we got to meet Chef Susur Lee. It was just the best timing, I was so excited to see him because I follow him on IG and I am a fan, so it was the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Amaazing food! Loved the patio in the summer. I usually sit at the bar when we go there, and the staff is great! You must get their infamous slaw! Yummm"}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants my fiancée and I always reminisce about. We came here twice during a 3-day stay in Toronto and that isn't something we usually do. The space is charming and the service is lovely - although it seems to be a little hectic during dinner. 

Where to start. The Singaporean Slaw is to die for! I could eat this every single day of my life. The flavors are really incredible and it's actually quite filling. Do not leave without trying this. It was a great start to both of the meals we had here. The Curry Roasted Chicken was also an excellent dish.

My favorite thing about our visit was THE SANGRIA CART. I can't even explain how delicious and amazing this stuff is. They give you a spoon because it has that many ingredients. It's freakin' unbelievable. Must try for yourself.

Lee is one of the reasons we fell in love with Toronto and hope to be back many times."}
{"text":"We love Susur Lee... we just went to his restaurant in Washington, DC and now Lee in Toronto.  

A couple of the dishes are the same and just as wonderful.  I highly recommend the Singapore Salad & the Black Cod.  They are just delicious.  We also had a special of the day an Asparagus salad with blackberries & goat cheese... Oh my was that wonderful!!!  Actually everything we had was just fabulous.

I highly recommend this restaurant.  It is a bit pricey but well worth it!  Our meal for two with a couple of beers & dessert was about $160 before tip."}
{"text":"I went for dinner and was great and staff were very friend and attentive !! Exotic cocktail"}
{"text":"Susur Lee was in the house the evening I dined at Lee, but not even his presence could change the fact that food at Lee, is lacking heart.

Food with heart you ask...Yes, food has heart. It's in the way the chef/cook cares for every component of the meal they make. From the ingredients they source, to the care they put into making it; watching it carefully as it sizzles, stews, simmers or bakes. You can tell Lee's kitchen is lacking real heart or care for what their sending out. 

The food was nothing more of average. The duck was too fatty, the cod too fishy and scallop over cooked. The only redeeming item on the menu is the singapore style slaw. All of the items on the menu are meant to be shared family style. The portions are a fair size with a price tag of $24-28+  for every entree. The menu is exciting and promises interesting fusions of food, but is a huge let down when it comes to flavor and getting the science of cooking right.

Service also was weak and unorganized. First, they were 30 minutes late to seating us, then our waitress kept trying to up-sell us on food and alcohol. There's nothing worse than a server whose not listening to what you want and only thinking of racking the bill up. All the food came out at the same time, we had to tell them to slow down. It was also brought out in the wrong order. Each waiter dropping our food off had the same bewildered look on their face. It also took my waitress 15 minutes to bring me chop sticks. Whose hiring these people?

Susur Lee needs to stop stamping his name on more restaurants and get a hold on his kitchen."}
{"text":"Lee's is newly renovated in 2014 and the look is perfect. The new bar is beautiful, as is the rest of this place from top to bottom. Corkage is available for $30 a bottle, which seems to be the going rate in King West, these days. On the high side, but better than overpaying for a subpar bottle off the list. I'm glad that so many places are now embracing corkage.

The hostess was pleasant and the waitstaff competent. This doesn't sound like a 5-star review, but my expectations for restaurants anywhere are not out of this world, and so many places fail to deliver in these regards. Our waiter was knowledge of the menu, the dishes and their ingredients. He was attentive but not overly present. This is what proper restaurants train their staff to do. Whoever is in charge of training the waitstaff should freelance -- I can recommend a few businesses that need some help.

The meal itself was delicious, but since I'm not familiar with so many of the foods here it is difficult to describe or compare them. Everyone was presented wonderfully and delivered appropriately, with enough time to enjoy the dishes before the next one is brought out. I find at many places that like to do communal, multi-course meals they mess up the delivery, and you end up two bites into one dish, only to have another arrive and placed awkwardly on the table. None of that here. Well done, folks. 

Hats off to whoever is in charge, this place is actually run, as opposed to being left on cruise control like so many other popular places."}
{"text":"They lost power, and then lost control of their minds, with how poorly they managed our experience afterwards. Worst service experience I have ever had, coming from a guy who works in the industry."}
{"text":"To start off, I loved the décor and ambiance of the dining area. It is very transformative from of business luncheon hotspot to an upbeat dining experience at night. I loved the vibe and the staffs; all were very young, beautiful and courteous/professional to drive customer service by the highest standard. The restaurant was quite packed on a Wednesday night for dinner service, but not once did I found myself feeling claustrophobic in similar settings. The servers were very quick and attentive to the smallest details. They were courteous in their approach, not once jumping in at in appropriate times- i.e in the middle of a conversation. 
Knowing that the restaurant was established by a world-class chef was the highlight of our decision to test the restaurant. My fellow diner was quite impressed with the experienced, yet I am not quite convinced. Perhaps I am less well-traveled or simply lack taste, whatever it is, I was less impressed with the actual culinary experience than most. I do not feel that the steep (and I mean STEEP) price tag remotely matched the value I gain from this experience-none the less, I was very happy and honor to get the experience to be treated to such meal by an amazing dining compadre.     
The fusion aspects of the food came across to me as a bit confused and muddy, I understand that it is completely my own opinion and may not be shared by others. I just feel like some of the dishes worked and yet others fell short of bringing that wow factor. We order 4 dishes- the basic Singaporean slaw, the Spicy Thai Wild Calamari with Sweet Lime & Chili Dip, Slow Braised Beef, and that night's up sale special was the  1/2 bbq chicken with a sweet and sour glaze and a mish mesh of other grilled veggie morsels I can't recall. 
The Singapore Slaw is definitely befitting to hold the title of being a featured and specialty dish. I opted for the basic slaw but it was well received (not too sure it's worth the price but definitely a dish I enjoyed most). The freshness and presentation of the plate was impressive. Tossed tableside, I feel kinda of bad that while the server was tossing and expertly explaining the dish, I zoned out only to want to dig in. The texture and taste of each components lend itself so completely and elegantly. The contrast of the texture just simply worked. Nothing was too \"raw\" or too overpowering. Even the usual edible flowers so frequently just tossed on a plate as mindless garnish somehow worked together with the rest of the ingredients to give a soft floral accent to the dish. I can go on and on about the one plate. I was delicious and refreshing-in both its simplicity of ingredients and the complexity of flavours. The expert tossing left every morsel of the ingredients well coated and not drenched. I have never enjoyed a salad so genuinely-it was a great start to the meal.
Next was the calamari. The sauce was good. The plate, minuscule. Nothing new or exciting, the fritters that was the filler to the dish was kind of tough by the time I got to it-distracted by the beautiful salad. The calamari, itself, was average and nothing spectacular-actually, not true, the price was spectacularly high for what we got. The \"paprika dipped lemon\" was highlighted but was lends nothing new.Overall, what it was, was a small portion of fried squid ring with off chili sauce-nothing more nothing less.
To continue on with the meal, we were delivered a ridiculously large plate with a small portion of braised beef. This is my qualm with such fusion food. Each component of the dish was well prepared. Together, I had not a clue of how it worked-this is coming from a girl that would throw sauce on everything.It just felt heavy and muddy (I don't know how to explain it any other way). The beef cheek was braised to perfection, mind you. It was tender enough to be cut with a spoon and sported all of its collagen filled goodness. The dish just didn't work for me. 
Last up for the bbq chicken. I have to give credit to the server for up selling this dish-by his enthusiasm and vigor. Later, it was of a different realization that we totally overpaid for something we could've gotten at any corner shop Chinese bbq shop, came completed with the classic ginger and green onion oil. The half a chicken, aforementioned, was laughable...think  1/2 a Cornish hen as in 3 small ring sized morsels of chicken and a leg. It was paired with a sweet and sour dark glaze that was average. The sautéed onion and grapes added a bit of contrast to the meatiness of the dish. The dish was a bit underwhelming-nothing wrong with the dish logistically. 
The downfall of over-rated restaurants high-end restaurants-everything is beautiful aesthetically but the wow factor kind of fall short from expectations. I struggle to justify its hefty price tag; 4 dishes with no accompaniment of extra drinks or desserts was a little steep north of 1 bill. I was very appreciative to spend that dining experience in the company of my dear tablemate."}
{"text":"Piece of shit. Horrible service. Abysmal. Go to gusto 101 up the street. I've never had such a horrible service before in my life. The food is alright...nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"So, I've been here a couple of times before but this review was prompted by that amazing slaw. 

Mixed table side, where they list the 20 ingredients -- you take a look at it and I had no idea it would taste like it did. It was so crisp and fresh and crunchy and although this is a sharing style restaurant, I could have consumed that slaw as my entree. 

The tuna sashimi, cheeseburger egg rolls, braised beef and the chicken curry -- all up on the tasty option list as well but seriously....that slaw...

Go there. Try it. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Wow! What can I say..Lee totally exceeded my expectations and I was thrilled to try Susur Lee's restaurant. I've heard many great reviews about this place and can attest that the Yelp reviews speak for itself. My sisters and I came here for a Summerlicious dinner and was fortunate to be able to make a reservation because it got pretty busy on a Friday night.

When we got there our server greeted us promptly and explained the history of the restaurant/Chef Susur Lee and the menu itself. He even suggested for us to try a serving of each Summerlicious item and order an extra 2-3 dishes which we are glad we did! It was such a great idea because we got share everything and taste a bit of everything. It was pretty much asian tapas style. For the two extra dishes, we ordered the Green Curry and the signature slaw. I must say that the slaw was hands down not only the best dish of the night but the best salad that I've had! I have been meaning to try this salad and I'm sure glad I did. I can't even tell you how good it was because it had such a unique flavour and the craftsmanship behind making the salad is incredible because it's composed of 19 different ingredients! Hard to even make it yourself at home.

I enjoyed every dish because they all had an asian twist to each one. The presentation was beautiful and the service was impeccable. I didn't order a drink but I highly recommend trying their Sangria, it was exquisite! 

I'm glad I got to try their Summerlicious menu and looking forward to going back to try their other signature dishes."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now . Both times everything has been delicious . The slaw is awesome and the cod is amazing . The braised beef is also pretty good.

The only thing I found mediocre was the soft crab that they had as a special on one evening . 

Drinks are also superb.  I had a lychee martini - just slightly overpriced"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Lee and we've decided that we'll be going every year we're in Canada for a visit.
I was surprised by how reasonable the prices were. Probably because we live in Stockholm and the meal we got at Lee would have easily cost us twice as much.
We ordered the oyster caesars to start. We found it surprisingly spicy. Mine was really hard to drink because the plum tomato kept clogging up the straw. The spiciness was a bit overwhelming.
Oyster shooters were just divine. It was the highlight of our meal. I could have had a dozen oyster shooters and called it a meal.
We ordered spice crusted diver scallops, Szechwan spicy pork ribs and oven roasted heirloom carrots and Jerusalem artichokes. Overall, all the dishes were really good but there were little issues here and there. I think the biggest issue I had with our meal was the Szechwan spicy pork ribs. The first piece I bit into was really pink. We normally eat our pork slightly pink but this was a bit too pink. The waiter told us that the ribs are cured beforehand and that it's safe to eat. The rest of the ribs were nowhere near as pink.
For dessert we ordered the French tangyuan and panna cotta. My husband (Swedish), who don't find regular tangyuan as delicious as I do (Chinese), thought the tangyuan was great. I really liked the panna cotta.
I think one of the thing that influenced my opinion has to do with the fact that I have certain preconceived ideas about some of these foods. Chocolate in tangyuan conflicts with what I'm used to when I eat tangyuan but I did find it less conflicting after my 2nd tangyuan.
We were informed ahead that Susur would be wandering around the restaurant throughout the night. He thanked us for coming when we were heading out. He was such a relaxed person, a lovely man. Much better than the hostess. Her snooty attitude when we showed up gave us something to laugh about when we got to our seats.
We weren't terribly fond of how loud the restaurant was but we also know that we're not like other people. We were seated in what I assumed as the \"lounge\" area and we definitely liked the relaxed atmosphere. Just would be that much better if we didn't have to yell at each other.
Since this was our first visit my opinions of Lee aren't fully formed. We will most definitely go back for the food."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Lee Restaurant, especially since I was a huge fan of him on Top Chef Masters...but I left wanting/expecting more.

All the reviews raved about the Singaporean Style Slaw, which really is amaaaaaaazing.  I'm actually drooling right now, just thinking about it (and I went to Lee Restaurant 3 months ago).  

For our entrees, I had the the Slow Braised Beef, which was a huge disappointment.  The beef itself was tender, but lacked any real flavor on its own and was a bit too fatty for my taste.  The combination of the tender/fatty beef with the potato puree and dollop of sour cream made me feel like I was eating a bowl of mush/baby food.  I guess the crispy shallots were supposed to provide some texture, but really didn't add anything.

My boyfriend had the Diver Scallops, which were cooked nicely.  All the components worked well together and the crispy bacon was a nice touch (i have a not-so-secret love affair with bacon).  

Drinks were $$$.  My dragonfly cocktail was tasty, but cost $14.50. 

The decor & music was nice, but I hate being packed into a restaurant like sardines.  Our table was sandwiched between tables on either side of us, then tables in front and behind us (really really difficult to get into and out of our seats).  When our waiter was mixing together our slaw, one of the patrons at the table next to us actually had to STAND UP in order to give him room to do his thing!!!  I guess she could've stayed sitting down if she wanted his butt directly in her face.

I don't live in Toronto, but plan on visiting again in the next few months.  Will I go back to Lee Restaurant?  Yes, but only to sit at the bar and devour the Singaporean Style Slaw."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of anything fusion. I'm very traditional when it comes to my meals. I have to give 5-stars for presentation and the 5-stars plus for the hype and word of mouth how Lee has continued since they first opened. I was there in the first year when they first opened when there wasn't an opening for days without end. Thankfully it isn't as crazy today, but I would still prefer traditional Chinese cuisine over this as his food and presentation is still very consistent.  

One of my litmus test before dinning at restaurants is to see who constitutes the majority of the diners. Obviously if it's, for example, Indian food, I much prefer to see lots of Indians. As for Lee, Chinese (and I'll even expand it broader to Asians) were definitely scarce. Perhaps, Asians don't really have the sophisticated taste buds of the urban chic who has reclaimed the downtown core."}
{"text":"I came here with my coworkers and the food was good, but too expensive.

What we ordered to share:
1. Singapore salad: 9/10. This was amazing! It had a nice lemony taste to it.
2. The Mexican goat cheese tart with zucchini, red peppers, green olives and arugula: 7/10. This was ok but not my cup of tea 
2. watermelon and feta cheese salad: 9/10. This is such a simple yet amazing dish. The contrast between the salty feta and sweet watermelon is mouth watering. Although it is very expensive for its simplicity, you can't help but get more. 
3. The ravioli lobster with cucumbers tomatoes: 8.5/10. This was slightly spicy and very good!
4. pulled beef tacos : 7.5/10. The taste was good but I did not like how spicy it was.   
5. lentil and quinoa croquettes : 8/10. Really good!
6. Sangria with 18 ingredients(crazy): 9/10. This was really good. Maybe because of the many ingredients in it. 
7.  Creme brûlée: 9/10. I love a good creme brûlée but this one was amazing
8. Molten chocolate lava cake: 9/10. This was also very good!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of Chinese food.  And this was good 

Nice flavours good quality ingredients. 

Cheeseburger spring roll is interesting

Portions are generous. Especially the slaw 

Great service.  

I would go again. Great place to take someone who likes fusion food and Chinese food.

The price is steep"}
{"text":"Love this place! I went here for my birthday and had such an amazing dinner. We ordered the signature coleslaw to start. This was not like a traditional coleslaw - there were so many flavours and textures. A must try! For the mains, we ordered the Green Curry Chicken and Braised Beef. The Green Curry is amazing and was my favourite dish of the night!! it was so unique and I love how it was deconstructed so that you can taste each of the different flavours and how they complement each other. I wish we ordered two of them - that's how good it was! The Braised Beef was good, the meat was very tender but it was a dish that you could order at other restaurants. We were too full for dessert for the menu looked really good. Next time I'll leave more room so that I can try some!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!

NOTE: Make reservations and try to come early. We were seated promptly at 5:30pm and didn't finish eating/settling the bill till 8:50pm rolled along. The service was great but due to the number of guests, lots of people with 8:30pm reservations were left waiting by the door.

Food here is sharing style and we ordered the following:
- Singapore slaw 
- Tuna tartare
- Cheeseburger spring roll taco
- Chocolate peanut butter bar
- To drink: Manhattan

The Singapore slaw really is as good as people hype it up to be. However, to manage expectations it's \"okay\". The portion is really generous, and it really isn't necessary to add on salmon and tuna sashimi to the slaw which tasted great on its own. 

The tuna tartare was good, and had a good range of flavours. It was paired with seared tuna sashimi on the side which was a nice touch. You can't go wrong with tuna tartare and sashimi!

Cheeseburger spring roll taco was okay, a little too fusionized for me. 

The chocolate peanut butter bar was AMAZING. It's so heavy you really need to share it, and was nicely covered in peanut grinds. Very nice touch :) 

I'd come back in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! I've done fusion before so I was excited to see how this worked out. Upon arrival we were greeted by the hostess who took our jackets and sat us. Decor is trendy and lighting creates great ambiance.  We were seated and our water girl filled our glasses.  They have a cocktail cart going around the restaurant. The server explained how it worked as well as suggesting signature dishes. Two of four people were returning so explained and filled in the gaps of what was not known. We took the suggestion as the food was for sharing and each picked a menu item. 

We ordered:
Their signature coleslaw
Cheese burger spring rolls
Lobster ravioli
Sambal satay 

Also each ordered drinks. Their oyster Cesar was very good. All the drinks were mixed well. Good bartender for once who actually took the time to prepare a drink. But then again at $18 a Cesar, you prob should expect the best :)

The coleslaw comes with a show when they mix it all together! She explains the ingredients as she mixes which is an experience in itself!

The cheese burger spring rolls were delicious and the sambal satay was filled with skewered chicken beef and shrimp cooked to perfection with the perfect pairing of sauces. 

I will say that the food was delicious, I liked the glass windows which gave it a nice warm feel having visited on a cold January day! 

Some bad things, the water girl had bad BO. Someone fix that issue! For the price I wish I knew the size of dishes as although filling I found some dishes light in portion size for sharing in a group. Just would help better with ordering.

Definitely worth checking out, great drinks, great presentation of food."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate a friend's bday and we all love love loved the food. Susur Lee never fails to impress! However, service was poor. We sat for approx 20 minutes before a server attend to us. Perhaps summerlicious might have something to do with it. Regardless, I will give it another shot. After All, 19 ingredients salad can never go wrong!"}
{"text":"Came here numerous times for weekend dinners, birthday dinners etc. Everything on the menu was so good, good for sharing, and affordable!

Don't sit in the back room, as there tends to be a draft which blows out the candles. Otherwise, it would have provided a more private ambiance than the front area."}
{"text":"I went to Lee with my fiancee for Winterlicious. I have wanted to try this restaurant for years to come! So I'm excited I finally got the chance!

The service was excellent! Our waiter was incredibly polite and I never had to ask for anything, he just came and got things done! When he learned Susur Lee was one of my favourite chefs, he made it so Susur Lee came out to greet us! How amazing is that? Not to mention, they fold your napkin when you go to the washroom! I didn't even see our waiter do that- he must be some sort of ninja waiter!

As for the food, it was delicious! We got one order of Winterlicious and some a la carte dishes. So yummy! The braised beef taco app was super yummy although it could go with a tad spice! The chicken entree was good! My fiancee ordered the Yucatan Sweet corn lettuce wraps- they were so good he has to be given extra lettuce wraps. My favourite dish I tried? Cheeseburger spring rolls! Just amazing and so flavourful! 

I would definitely come here again and recommend it to anybody! I will be back to try the regular menu that's for sure!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto! Love the Singapore slaw of course, as well as the octopus, lamb chops, and cheeseburger spring rolls. Been here about three times and plan to return again and again. Excellent cocktails and service too."}
{"text":"Good service. Tables a little narrow and awkward. The slaw was superb. They recite all 26 ingredients in it. The main course was not to die for. A little bland. Great ambiance and sitting outside we got to do my favourite activity, people watching."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic experience while we were in Toronto for the summer. We did the tasting menu and the choices were spot on. From the signature Singapore slaw to the fiery mango shrimp to the Japanese dumpling for dessert, it was a perfect meal! Our waiter was superb and the staff as a whole made our experience over the top. Foodies of the world definitely need to put this place on their list to try."}
{"text":"Take this as a 4.5 rating.

Been wanting to come here for awhile now and finally had the chance this past weekend. I love the ambiance and decor. Classy and trendy - fancy enough to come here for a special occasion but you can also get by with some casual clothes without feeling out of place.

Service was stellar. Mark was fantastic and probably one of the best servers I've ever had. His French accent is so charming and I loved his enthusiasm. I like that each dish is explained and recommendations on how to eat it are given. It really made a difference to our dinner. Bravo! 

We ordered the Singaporean Slaw, Carmelized Black Cod, Top Chef Green Chicken Curry and the signature French & Chinese Tong Yuen for dessert.

Singaporean Slaw was amazing. We had it at Bent a few months back and fell in love so we decided to try it here. Just as good as I remembered. It's pretty much an introduction (or rather initiation) dish that everybody orders when they come to Lee and justifiably so.

The Carmelized Black Cod was perfectly cooked, served on top of a dimsum turnip cake. Who would've thought that the two would complement each other so well? Asian fusion at its finest! The texture and flavors were so much richer with the miso mustard. 

The Tong Yuen was beautifully presented and will make you want to take out your phone for a photo. It was a head turner. It's VERY sweet on the first bite due to the chocolate but the glutinous rice flour helps to neutralize it. I loved the idea of having a two-step process to eating the dish. The Tong Yuen is to be taken first in a single bite, then you pour the peach and rosewater dressing into the pastry for a refreshing and cleansing finish to the meal.

The only disappointment of the night was the Top Chef Green Chicken Curry. You are to eat the chicken with the fried rice cake and dried pineapple. While I appreciated the creativity, I just couldn't get behind it. The pineapple was a bit overpowering, there wasn't enough curry so the chicken tasted rather plain and I felt the rice cakes didnt belong there. The dish overall just lacked depth. I guess I had higher expectations considering that this was an award winning dish that received the highest score ever on the show but it just didn't deliver as I had hoped.

Our dinner was near perfection in all aspects and definitely hits the favorites list. It was so close to getting the full 5 stars if not for the curry chicken."}
{"text":"It was easy to get a reservation on Friday evening, which was great  As soon as we arrived we were immediately seated. The service was a bit slow, but the food was fabulous. The menu is very limited. We ordered for tangy prawns and lamb chops. Both were great!"}
{"text":"I came here during winterlicious and I gotta say, it was my favourite out of all the ones I've tried. I got the spring roll with coleslaw, penang chicken and the dessert trio. All three dessert screamed Asian Fusion, and I was most delighted by the chicken, which was deep fried in this curry batter and served with two delicious sauces made with tropical fruits (I am guessing), one of which is mango. It was a delightful mix of sweet and salty, and the basil on top was a good compliment. The portions were also pretty big, considering it was part of Winterlicious."}
{"text":"The signature Singapore slaw is outstanding as are the cocktails.  Try the slaw and skip the rest!  Most of the food is overly saucy or salted and the Master Chef chicken dish was just vile.  Despite this, I am at a regular at Lee because the drinks and the Singapore slaw are just THAT good.  Service is hit and miss (and last time I went was terrible) and you must, at all costs, avoid being seated in the middle of the crowded and noisy second room."}
{"text":"Made reservations for Saturday night around 2 weeks in advance and managed to land a 5:45pm dinner slot. It was pretty busy for being this early, but expected for a swanky upscale restaurant. I had pretty high expectations for the restaurant ... and was a little bit underwhelmed to be honest. 

Service was awesome and our main waiter was fairly attentive. But the food however... fell a little bit flat for me. 

Slaw salad - this was probably the best-tasting part of the meal! For $25, it's got a pretty hefty price tag, but I had shared this with one other person and I was already halfway full once we finished it. Would I get it again? Maybe. But with the price tag, I felt like I could've gotten something similar for cheaper at another restaurant. It had flower petals though. It's pretty. 

Chicken Curry - heard gud stuff about this... not my favourite dish. The chicken was VERY tender and the skin was pretty crispy (almost felt like peking duck), but it was kind of bland and the sauces weren't really working out for me. Was not really a fan of any of them. The dish was pretty though. 

Peking Duck - Asian fusion things, so they had foie gras, marmalade, and things. S'ok. I wish they brought this out before the chicken curry because I was pretty stuffed after the chicken and couldn't really enjoy it, this is my fault. Overall, it was pretty good - but the sauces were a miss for me. This was a pretty dish though. 

Overall - 3.5/5 
Maybe my expectations were too high and I'm not used to the good life. Would come back for salad to share though :D"}
{"text":"Severely overpriced food given what it was. I honestly don't understand the glowing reviews but can only imagine it to be people hyping it up due to the Susur Lee branding. My friend and I had the feature Sangria which was rather sweet, and shared 3 dishes: the Signature Singaporean Slaw (added the tuna), fennel crusted diver scallop, and caramelized black cod. For essentially a salad, the signature Singaporean slaw was pretty ridiculously priced ($25 + $19 for added tuna) at $44. We did not find it very special. The scallop was pretty good, but the black cod had an overpowering mustard sauce that detracted from the fish's natural tastes. Overall, wouldn't come back and wouldn't recommend - you can find better food at same or lower price points elsewhere for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing food, delicious  and worth the wait!!! Came here for a private party and will definitely come back for
More!!

The Singaporean slaw abs the cheeseburger spring rolls are to die for!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fusion kitchen at its best... We got the chef's menu. They kept bringing all these dishes while we enjoyed the food and the company. The Singapore slaw is no any slaw.. It's the slaw of slaws. We started our meal with slaw and ended it with slaw, not to mention all the great dishes that were in between. I was filled up to the brim by the end of the night."}
{"text":"I love the consistency.  The food always tastes great and the service is solid. 

We went there for my birthday with a group of 11. Service was impeccable, the server recommended the chefs daily selection that would include my favorites: caramelized cod and cheeseburger spring rolls.

I will keep going back without a doubt"}
{"text":"Location: King street west -- FUN AREA, lots of bars, food places, and lively street at night for chilling. This is easy to find and very visible with glass windows all along the restaurant front. 

Atmosphere: It is quite a romantic and cozy place to dine with a group or for an intimate gathering. 

Service: We had a great waiter who had some good recommendations and tips on ordering since my friend and I are new to try this restaurant. I liked that there was coat check and you can give them your big winter coat to put away. You can order their signature cocktails and they can make it tableside. Certain time of the year, they make different drinks. During the summer, you can order sangria and they make it table side. We went during this winter, and they had another signature cocktail that my friend ordered instead. 

Food: Of course, I'm here for their popular Singapore slaw. If I can upload a video of them mixing it for you at the table, I would. It was a good sized dish to share between 2 people. My friend said she can probably order the whole thing and eat it herself as a meal. Since we came for dinner, we figured that we can order a few items from the menu to split. There were tasting menus that included a lot of their signature dishes like the curry chicken, singapore slaw, dessert, etc ... we didn't order that because we were not as hungry for dinner and not prepared to eat a several dishes in one sitting. NEXT TIME I CAN try though!

Singapore slaw- Great flavours. Love the dressing or whatever the sauce was because it gave it such a light, refreshing flavour. The textures of the nuts, the plants, and the shredded veggies was such a great combination for the chew factor. I haven't had such a great salad in a long time! I'm glad we ordered 1 to share because it would be too much to eat, then I would have no room for other food .

Tuna tartare - I think it's OK but not my fav. There were crisp taro chips to dip the tuna tartare with, but not enough (  only 6 pieces for a big portion of tartare). We simply asked for more taro chips for dipping and our waiter was happy to bring some. The dish also had seared tartare. Again, it was OK but wasn't my fav of the dishes we ordered. I'll pass for this .

Black cod- Suprisingly after all the salad and tuna that we ate, the black cod finally arrived and we were so full. It gave a good sized portion and we shared this between 2 people. I enjoyed the flavours and the oily goodness of how black cod tastes! I LIKE!!

Dessert- mango panna cotta - WE WERE SOOOO FULL but I had to order dessert because I love Pannacotta, it looked so good in pics and YAY this was no disappointment.  I really enjoyed the flavour and the tartness of it. They served the panna cotta over some sticky purple/wild rice! It was a great combo for just a little bit more texture and chew! GREAT!!

Cocktail- I love mojito usually ... but this time I ordered a little twist from my usual cocktail drink. I ordered the something called Green Dragon? Or Dragon something (cannot find it on the restaurant menu when i tried to look up the name.. sorry). It was really good. It has a little bit of a spicy kick but very light and citrus/sweet flavour. 

OVERALL: I would love to come here again for their SLAW salad and return to try some other popular restaurant items!!!"}
{"text":"After seeing Susur Lee on many shows, I was ecstatic when my friend picked one of his restaurants for her birthday. 

We booked a reservation for 3, but if you're going during the week day it doesn't really seem like a reso was necessary! 

The atmosphere was beautiful, dim, and relaxing. 

We got 4 items which was recommended for 3 people

Obviously we had to get his signature dish, the Singaporean Slaw with Salmon Sashimi. It has 19 ingredients (20 including the salmon) that come together so well in a delicious salad, we wanted to get a second one. But one was enough to feed all three of us! Highly recommend to everyone that goes to Lee's to start off with the slaw.

Secondly, we got the Cheeseburger Spring Rolls. At first we were iffy because we kept saying we didn't come here for just spring rolls but our waiter told us that these spring rolls were their second best seller and then we were sold. It was recommended that we ate it like a taco since it can get messy and it did a bit. The spring roll has a lettuce wrap on the outside which helped balance out all the meat with something light and refreshing. It definitely tasted like a cheese burger. I would recommend this too!

Then, we got the Peking and Char Sui Duck Breast. To our surprise it came with a lot of wraps (we expected to have like 2 wraps each but ended up with 3 each) The dish came with many things you can put into your pancake and something's you wouldn't find in your typical Chinese restaurant peking duck's. It came with foie gras pate, fried bean curd, two different types of sauces (one was hoisin and I forgot what the other one was) some sort of fruit jam, cilantro, cucumbers, green papaya, and some red spicy thing. I really enjoyed this and was so happy it came with a lot of pancakes. The display for this dish was also very beautiful!

Lastly for dessert, we saw the table next to us and because of the presentation we decided to get it too. The Signature French and Chinese Tong Yuen had such an exquisite presentation and was recommended we ate everything in one bite to capture all the flavours. 

Overall we enjoyed our visit at Lee's and I give everything a 5/5 rating. Food, atmosphere, and service."}
{"text":"My biggest beef while living in Toronto was that I never had a real memorable meal.  Most places I went to were either 'meh' or were good but nothing I couldn't cook at home.  Given, as a student I would have never been able to eat at Lee, but we wanted to go out for a special meal to thank J's parents for their help with our wedding.  So it was definitely a \"splurge\" for us (worked out to about $250 for 4 people with some booze having been consumed).

Thanks to rush hour traffic, we were already running late when we headed to Lee.  We called to let them know that we'd be late on our reservation but they were okay with that.  We were seated promptly at a four-top indoors.  Our server was very friendly - knowledgeable, nice, and not afraid to give her opinions.  She was also not too intrusive and seemed to know when to be present and when to be scarce.

Because of my dietary restrictions (kosher meat-wise) we opted not to do the chef's selection and instead picked items off the menu, including those that I could eat and some I couldn't.  We ordered the following:

Fried Tomato Salad - I expected this to be like fried green tomatoes but instead it was more like a thick tomato basil sauce.  It packed a lot of flavor but the textures weren't too diverse - mostly soft.  Probably the lowlight of the night though tasty.

Singapore Slaw - ORDER THIS.  You hear 17 ingredients and think \"ick\" but man does everything go well together.  It's a super light and refreshing dish, tons of different flavors and textures that actually work and the presentation is absolutely beautiful.  Just get it.  We paid the extra $6 for the sashimi salmon on the side and it was really good - they seasoned it with a bit of salt and we devoured the thing.

Salmon Ceviche - Interesting.  This was made of 6 spoons that had salmon with daikon, ginger, ponzu and a few other ingredients.  Very composed, interesting flavors - nothing like any other ceviche I've tried before.

Garlic shrimp - This was a big hit with the others but I didn't try it myself.

Slow braised beef - another big hit (very tender, I heard) but also didn't try.

Lamb - J said it was cooked to perfection and it was devoured in an instant.

For dessert we split the banana cake, creme brulee, and the dumplings.  The dumplings were the biggest surprise but were really scrumptious - like warm mochi.  The banana cake was delish and the creme brulee (though not as inventive as the rest) was really tasty.  

We had a great time and really it's the first memorable dining experience I had in Toronto since first visiting in 2003 (and living there for 2 years).  I'm with Team Susur!"}
{"text":"fantastic Indonesian slaw... loved the Korean rib.. def melted in my mouth.. service was great, space is beautiful... only complaint was that i got too full to try something else!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had such a great time at Lee! The atmosphere is very relaxed, yet fancy at the same time. There are even some Chinese decorations around the bar (lanterns, Chinese calculators) which I thought was beautifully done!! Looks so cool. The service was amazing from hostess to server to food expo. Everyone was extremely friendly and constantly came to check up on us to make sure we were doing okay! We even got to see famous Chef Susur Lee lurking around hahaha. Overall experience was wonderful and I wouldn't hesitate to come back here a second time. 

Finally got to try Susur's SIGNATURE Singaporean-Style Slaw and it certainly lived up to my high expectations. There was so much variety and so many layers to it, and every part of it tasted just right! Very, very good and flavourful. I added Sashimi (6pcs) for $8 which I thought was worth it. It definitely added to the dish. The only downside was that it supposedly serves two, but was a bit too much for the two of us. I think it would be better suited for 3 people, or even 4 if you just want a little bit each! After all, it is just an appetizer/something to start you off with. 

I also thought the Cheese Burger Spring Roll was an interesting concept so I had to try it. It was definitely another unique item and was delicious! Meaty, cheesy, yet still had that Asian spring roll taste to it. However, I likely would not buy it again - One of those one timers for me. Eat it with the salad!

In addition, I also participated in the Winterlicious prix fixe menu for $45:

1) ROASTED JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE & SPICED HAZELNUTS (vegetarian) - Light Goat Cheese, Maple Balsamic Glaze - I don't recommend this, as it was the only part of my meal that I didn't enjoy. Tasted kind of funny to me, and not in a good way.

2) LEE'S SLOW BRAISED BEEF - Roasted Root Veg, Potato & Leek Purée - This was one of my favourite dishes during my visit! The beef was cooked so nicely and tasted incredible. Real juicy, soft, and tender. Absolutely loved the potatoes/veggies as well. 

3) SPRING ROLL CRÈME BRULEE + HOT APPLE STRUDEL + PANI PURI - Trio of Desserts! Perfect Winterlicious restaurant choice because of the variety of dessert you get. It gives you a taste of 3 different things, which is great for trying something new. My favourite of the 3 was the spring roll creme brulee! Melts in your mouth and simply compliments your meal. The others were good too."}
{"text":"I went for Summerlicious and it was the best meal I've had in the past year. I have a love hate relationship with summer/winter-licious because many restaurants end up half-assing their dishes because they know they'll be pumping out so many. So, the food becomes boring, simple, underwhelming food compared to that which many restaurants are known for.  Lee is not one of these restaurants. Susur Lee KILLED IT!!! I went with my father and we got 2/3 of the menu and loved every single dish. The one that stood out to me was the jerk pork ribs on bao, I still daydream about it! I also had a delicious blood orange ginger drink that was out of this world delicious, but a bit on the pricey end of the spectrum. The service was wonderful and the atmosphere was nice and intimate out on the front patio. Inside was freezing though, so if you plan to be indoors, bring a sweater!


TL;DR: Lee=amazing experience, the best food, bring a sweater if you're going to eat inside!"}
{"text":"Ok so the hype had us convinced this should be the first place for dinner in Tor.  Unfortunately the service and well below optimal portions has me waiting for a burger down the street!  After dropping $160 I came out hungry and annoyed. Well done."}
{"text":"Lee is the less-pricey and tapas-style alternative to degustation-heaven Susur next-door. We made reservations as soon as Toronto came on the travel radar. Surfing on-line last night we learned that Susur closed a few days ago, as he is working on an upcoming outpost in Manhattan (sometime fall '08).  That made me nervous that the food at Lee would be less than stellar, less focused.

Since we were the first to arrive, we got a choice of tables: a two-top upfront, where the walls are covered with silk screens of little birds on a branch, or the elevated area near the bar with deep pink walls.  We chose the back for a little more privacy since there are only two two-tops in the back and nobody appeared to be at the bar.  Nobody until we sat down.

There we were discussing menu strategy when hubby ever so slightly pointed to someone at the bar behind me.  

Susur.

Gulp.

Our server, Darryl,  was friendly and helpful, asking if it was our first time at Susur and talking us through the highlights.  The duck confit rolls were  of interest but we weren't sure if the goat cheese was pasteurized.  Darryl clearly knew the menu and let us know that it was pasteurized.  When taking our drink orders, he learned that I am not doing alcohol, so he set me up with a virgin cocktail of pineapple & guava juice with edible petals.  Perfect for this 87 degree tropical weather!

We ordered the signature 18 ingredient Singapore Slaw (this blows away famous salad at Burma Superstar.  Don't even get me started!), the salmon ceviche for the hubby and a few other items.  6 large garlic shrimp came with potato pea fritters- a kind of riff on samosas- and julienned mango and cucumber.  The balance between the chili and garlic was impeccable.  

The duck confit rolls were outstanding, with caramelized pineapple, the aforementioned goat cheese, and candied nuts.  Outrageously good.

The only misstep for me was the jerk chicken with a scotch bonnet rub and sauce on the side.  It was a generous portion, but just not speaking to me.  Must have had my mind on other things by then.  Dessert!

I don't know who the dessert chef but hats off to them.  My motto is to keep pastry chefs in business.  We ordered a chocolate meringue with lemon cream, coconut, and a guava sorbet.  It seems like the chocolate would fight with the lemon, but it was genius.  The meringue was perfect- no small feat in this wicked humidity.  One bite and I wondered if we were in Singapore.

At one point, we were oohing and ahhing and Susur walked by.  Starstruck as we are, we said hello to the chef and congratulated him on his impending NY arrival.

With the bill came a little shameless commerce.  A tiny red card announced that you too could purchase Susur's cookbook.  He had been at the bar autographing 2 box loads of them when we first arrived.  I didn't buy one but I can only hope that being near such greatness will inspire me in the kitchen when we get home. . . or to plan another Toronto trip or a NYC trip when his new resto settles into their groove.

(This review was originally posted on 6/9/2009 when I was hoping that yelp would expand to Canada.)"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've tried a while!! 

Everything from the ambiance, service, and food was just on point. I love the spacious feel here and contrasting pink acrylic tables. Tried the Singapore slaw, scallops, lobster ravioli, duck, and signature tang yuan for dessert. 

Favourite HANDS DOWN is the lobster ravioli. Words do no justice so you just gotta try it. Scallops and Singapore slaw was also great. Presentation of the food was impeccable, portions were perfect for sharing amongst a group of 4. 

Duck was a miss for me. I enjoy the traditional Asian bbq duck, with the skin thinly sliced, and this interpretation of duck (thick meat and no skin) just didn't hit the spot. 

For dessert I HIGHLY recommend getting the tang yuan. I love the mix of Chinese and Indian influence, with the sweet/fruity twist on the traditional tang yuan and pani puri. 

Overall verdict: Thinking about my next meal here."}
{"text":"The slaw was good but everything else was too much of a flavour mash up. The service also left a lot to be desired, I would expect way more from a pricey restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food and ambiance. We sat at the bar while waiting for a table....had a great time at the bar and decided to eat right there. Everything we had was awesome. I like the fact that Susur Lee was actually there as well. The slaw was to die for. Best food on King St......hands down.
Ended up having 8 mojito's between the two of us and a great meal."}
{"text":"Scrumptious, delicious, divine! These words do not do Lee justice! A cornucopia of flavours danced across my tongue all night. The Singapore slaw was an utter delight. It ran from tangy to sweet, and had just the right amount of zip to be labelled perfection. Other notables were the satays and mexican goat cheese tart. I'm surprised I wasn't rolled out of there!

The DJ was phenomenal and has me smiling all night after he played \"50 ways to leave your lover\". Our server was fantastic, helpful and charming without being overbearing. I only wish that it was a touch quieter, so that conversation is a little easier but really who has time to talk when you're devouring food that fantastic!?"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. Their octopus is the best I've ever tasted and a generous portion. Their special Slaw is so flavorful, and the main dish I keep going back for. Probably one of my favorite foods ever. Ambiance is also really nice for occasions. The patio during the summer is super cute too. Suggest making reservations in advance!"}
{"text":"this is a fusion restaurant, try tofu then you would understand. And traditional Chinese tangyuan desert with Lee's twist!"}
{"text":"We came to Lee for a special occasion dinner and it was our first time here. Took off 1 star because our entire meal from sitting down to paying our bill took about 3.5 hours. I think that's too long.

Overall, I thought this was a great restaurant, and a great meal (minus the time it took). Presentation for every dish was beautiful, and every dish that was brought to our table was explained in full.

Oysters - 4.5/5. I'm not sure of theiri name but they were from the East Coast. They were delicious and some were huge. The 3 sauces were unique, but I usually enjoy my oysters with just some horseradish or lemon so I didn't use the sauces much. No lemon wedge, but it did come with some other small citrus fruit (possibly a calamansi?).

Signature Singaporean Slaw - 5/5. I'm not a huge salad person and I didn't think salad could be this good, but boy, it was really good. Crispy, crunchy, light, tasty, and so many flavours mingling together. Def order this if you come here. The server bringing it to your table explains all of the ingredients and mixes it and serves it for you.

Top Chef Green Curry Chicken - 3/5. This is a signature dish, but honestly, I was underwhelmed. I thought the chicken was okay, and enjoyed the sides that it came with (rice cake and baked pineapple that had huge flavour). Can't say I would order it again though.

Slow Braised Beef - 5/5. We loved this dish and was sad it came out last because by that point we were pretty full. The beef was flavourful and tender. The horseradish sour cream on top was delicious. Our favourite dish of the night.

Dessert - 5/5. They had an apple strudel on special that night. The apple filling was in phyllo pastry which was different from your usual strudel. It came with rhubarb and vanilla icecream. Really yummy. I ate most of it even though I was already pretty full. BF got the molten chocolate cake. He really enjoyed it too. Would recommend if you're a big chocolate lover. It was a bit too chocolatey for me.

Drinks - 3.5/5. I had their signature mandarin lychee drink. It was a special that apparently Susur made up for Lunar New Year and they were still selling it because it was so popular. I liked it, but found it a little sour for my taste. BF had the mojito which was okay, but nothing special. Drinks were $18 and $17 each - a little steep.

Service - 4.5/5. Our server, Marc, was very nice and I thought he did a good job. He did have a pretty thick accent so it was a bit hard for us to understand everything he was saying, but we got the gist of it. Our table was wiped down of any spills/crumbs after every course which was appreciated. Every dish that came to our table was explained by the person bringing it (not just the name of the dish, but the ingredients as well). Our water glasses were continually topped up throughout the meal. I feel like the service staff here get excellent training.

Ambience - 5/5. I enjoyed the decor and thought it was upscale without being stuffy, and thought the space was unique, welcoming and comfortable. The clientele was also mixed. Lots of couples, but also groups of varying ages which is nice to see."}
{"text":"Coriander overload! Seriously, I felt like I was on an episode of Iron Chef where the ingredient that had to be in every meal with coriander.

The Singapore Slaw was good and had a lot of different flavours which made it easy to overlook the coriander. Cheeseburger Spring Rolls - also good but again, had an underlying flavour of coriander slightly in the mix. Then we moved onto the Jerk Spicy Ribs, which again had little bits of coriander glazed right onto the meat. Luckily we ended with the Rack of Lamb which was my favourite item of the night, although wasn't as impressed with the tomato lentil mixture accompanying them. 

The service was fine and I don't have any real complaints... But overall, especially at its price, it was really not the impressive experience I was anticipating."}
{"text":"You have to love a restaurant that surpasses all expectations. I expected the food to be good, it was in fact superior. I expected the service to be pretentious, the kind you find in other high end restaurants in the city; it was not. The staff go out of their way to make your dining experience excellent. The evening was topped if by Chef Lee coming out from the kitchen to meet the people who took the time to visit his establishment. He made it a point to stop by and say hello and thank you to everyone who was dining there.   AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Our server recommended the slaw, and their special being buttermilk fried chicken which she said was $30.00. The slaw was delicious but the chicken dish was three little pieces of chicken which was more like a child's portion it was so small.  When she brought the bill, the charge for the chicken was $35.00, not the $30.00 she had stated for the dish. Her response was thank you for bringing to my attention the fact that I gave you the wrong price for the chicken dish, and then she walked away.  This is not how the situation should have been handled. This is not a restaurant I would go back to."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday night and as always this place is full with people. Excellent service. Our server was attentive and know tbe menu pretty well. 

We ordered the Chef Lee winning plate. I must say the flavor and the spices they put into the sauce is a perfect combination that I don't know how to describe. 

He really did an amazing job on making Chinese fusion food."}
{"text":"The food was fair to excellent. We liked the Singapore slaw. The Hong Kong noodles less so.

HOWEVER, we were served a glass of water as a dessert wine. A small glass of water. I have never seen such an aggressive bait and switch. When I mentioned it to the manager, as a wine professional, he made excuses. The behavior is very dubious. BUYER BEWARE."}
{"text":"I had the Singapore style slaw (lovely explosion of flavours in your mouth), Mexican goat cheese tart, assam Thai beef satay, Mediterranean grape and feta salad (why bother?), caramelized black cod (interesting combo, nice textures), top chef green curry chicken (wondered if it was undercooked as I had loose stool the next day, tasty but \"sloppy\"), cheese burger spring roll (imaginative and delicious), Korean pepper marinated striploan (basically a striploan steak with some Korean condiments but nice tasting) and rack of lamb thailandaise (interesting and tasty combination, lamb was cooked to perfection).
Was there for a medical meeting. Found it curious you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the conference room. Seemed like and afterthought. Great service and nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Visited Toronto for work and this was a recommendation. It did not disappoint. We ordered the slaw because it is there most famous dish. We added the sashimi tuna. I really didn't understand the hype until I tried it! 19 ingredients, excellent presentation and the flavors are amazing.  We also had the chicken dish since it was the very item that won Chef Lee, Top Chef. It was excellent! Also don't miss the Sangria. Refreshing, 25 ingredients including a tropical fruit cocktail that is left to enjoy in your glass. Service was exceptional and patio was a great atmosphere. I would return and try more items that looked amazing as I watched them all delivered to other tables. Great place!"}
{"text":"We did not have much expectations coming here but wow, this is the true definition of asian fusion. 

The Singaporean slaw is definitely one of the highlights: a mixture of different textures and different types of crunchy. A strong nutty taste to the dressing but yet it was different to all the peanut sauces. Another one of our favourites was the black cod, it tasted just like the traditional Chinese steamed fish both in term of the texture and the flavours. My ultimate favourite dish was the feature dessert of the night which consisted of coconut ice cream (made from coconut cream), it was the type of dish that instantly transports you to Asia. 

We also ordered the peking duck which was a very very generous portion and also very yummy as well as the panna cotta.

Overall, we did not have a single dish that we didnt like and never left a restaurant this full."}
{"text":"We started with the Singapore Slaw, it was a phenomenal dish. Very smartly created and all the sweet sour taste with the crunches it was a great start.
It has the same kind of idea of an indian chat but without the chat masala and chili and more sweetness added. The julienned ingredients play their role to elevate the dish as well.

The 'Luckee' shrimp was our next dish and it was the most favourite dish. The way the crispiness inside the dimsum was maintained was the biggest talking point for us while enjoying every bite. The sweet soy sauce was really good.

The last dish was the peiking duck and this really brought the whole experience down, may be we did not realize, while ordering that
all of our dishes were on the sweeter side. By the time we finished this dish, we realized that sugar was the main hero of the night.
All the sauces had loads of sugar in them. I asked myself am in Sususr Lee's or Sugar Lee's?
The duck felt a little dry as well. I was really dissapointed in the fact that I was happy till the second dish and the third dish just made me sad. 
I was really expecting a lot from the duck dish and duck is one of my favourite meat. We did not order our dessert after this.

My advise to the restaurant would be to provide some guidance while taking orders. Because everyone likes a bit of roller coaster taste journey. For us it was sweet, sweeter, sweetest."}
{"text":"My experience at Lee was all sorts of awesome. I went in already wooed by Susur Lee on Top Chef & his various other appearances. I went during Summerlicious for their special $45 dinner menu. You get an appetizer, entree and dessert for the set Summerlicious price. My friend and I also tried some items from off the set menu which I really enjoyed. Lee was a bit hidden but once we knew what we were looking for, the lit up \"L\" made it easy to find.

My friend and I were immediately seated and both loved the décor & atmosphere of the restaurant - casual but classy. Our gingery server was great throughout the meal & attended to all our needs. On to the grub!

When I saw the Cheeseburger Springrolls on the menu, I totally pressured my bud into ordering them because they sounded so inventive and unique. He was a bit skeptical because you get just 2 for $14 which is a bit pricey but man was it worth it! The springrolls really tasted like a cheeseburger, wrapped in lettuce with a dash of smoked chili mayo which was enough for a kick but didn't overpower the dish for me. I could have ate boatloads of them but settled with my half of the two.

My friend ordered the Chicken Dumpling for $22 and he loved it. For my main entrée I had the Crispy crusted halibut and the dish was superb. The crust on the dish was delicious - it was more pastry like and when it arrived I was a bit confused. After taking a bite though, it was more than a welcome surprise to my tastebuds. The fish was in some pepper, garlic and a delicious lemon caramel miso sauce. I would recommend this dish to all and would get it again myself in a heartbeat.

For dessert, my friend and I shared the Jade Almond Cake which was a plethora of ingredients and flavors that all harmoniously sang together. Presentation was gorgeous and every ingredient stood out on its own but also went together very smoothly.

The highlight of my night was seeing Susur Lee! He was in and out of the kitchen which was a real treat for a celebrity chef stalker like me. Our total for 2 without tip but with tax was $91.53 which wasn't too bad for a restaurant I've wanted to try for some time."}
{"text":"Slaw was good as normal.

However it was a bit annoying because we were pressured to clear the table for another party AFTER we had to pay 17% included gratuity for parties of 6 or more. We were not warned about this prior. Service was good up to that point and this was a major turnoff when your server rushes you out so the restaurant can make more profit. 

Winterlicious was great but this time the green curry chicken was too saucy. The dishes were interesting but not memorable."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. BUT, the service is lacking big time....waiters bumping into each other, we were served the wrong dishes twice, and then just lots of mix ups between waiters."}
{"text":"Tried a couple of the classics: green curry chicken, singaporean style slaw.
Also had the mango pudding dessert (don't remember what it was called). 

The singaporean slaw was extremely good - great combination of flavors and textures and cool plating. 
Green curry chicken also good - great flavors, but the chicken was a bit fatty for my taste."}
{"text":"My daughter and I come every year for her birthday. The food was impeccable but unfortunately one of the two main courses we ordered arrived one hour into our reservation. It was still very good but the flow of the occasion was awkward. We asked for our leftovers to be boxed but they weren't returned from the kitchen, so we forgot them. I was a little disappointed as it is splurge for me. Would I return? I'm not sure."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have gone to Lee, the first was last year for my birthday. I made a reservation for my sister and I online, I love when you have this option as I do not enjoy having to call and find what times are available. 
We were the first to arrive as dinner opens at 5:30, not sure if this was why but the staff was so attentive. It was like having 5 waiters! They were even nice enough to charge my sister's phone in the office for her. The decor and lighting in here is perfect, upscale yet cozy. 
I knew we had to have the Singapore Slaw, it is just non negotiable! It was just as delicious as I remembered, it is like every bite is a new flavour experience, considering how many ingredients there are I guess this should not be surprising. It is also a huge amount, I forgot how big it is. I know the price may seem off-putting but just get it, there is no way you would buy and julienne all those ingredients, trust me it is worth every penny.
We also got the Indian vegetable Fritters and the Buddha Style Lettuce Cups with Tofu & Veg. I ended up abandoning the lettuce for the lettuce cups and just eating the inside lol I felt like the lettuce was almost taking away from what you really want! The Fritters were delicious, the outside was nice and crispy, I just wish the centre could be a bit crispier, but that may just be a personal preference. 
The waitress said what we got would be just enough for two people, but honestly it was too much! We would have been fine with the slaw and the fritters alone, so if you're not huge eaters keep this in mind. 
Our bill came to just over 80.00 with the three items plus one alcoholic beverage, which for a high end restaurant is not shocking. You can save a lot of money by sticking to water."}
{"text":"Lived up to the hype for sure! 

Got a 6:30 reservation and by the time it hit 7 the restaurant was rammed on the Thursday night. Very cool vibe and ambiance.  Hostesses and wait staff were constantly around and attentive. Took a lot of time to explain the dishes/specials and drinks. Were very understanding of my weird food allergies (plums/apples)

No wonder everyone tries the singapore slaw. So many layers of texture, flavour and it hit the spot.  The server even brought a special dressing since the regular dressing is made of plums. We also had the edamame hummus and the beef tenderloin steak, cauliflower puree with a goat cheese ravioli (special). The special was fantastic! 

My second Susur experience and I can see why he is killing the Toronto/Canadian food market. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Great upscale restaurant serving modern Asian fusion dishes that can be paired with potent delicious cocktails. We ordered the famous 19-ingredient Singaporean-style slaw and the Top chef dish Curry Roasted Chicken. Both are delicious and came in big portions. For dessert, we ordered the signature dish which consists of dumplings with chocolate-peanut spread inside and some pastry with cream. It was my least favorite part of the meal, and I love desserts. Will have to try the rest of the dessert menu when I go back. Both cocktails that we ordered were potent and refreshing. Service is amazing! Definitely not your usual Asian restaurant and this is a compliment."}
{"text":"Great place for a girls night! I'm a bit cautious with Asian fusion places because most times it tastes just like regular chinese food with a higher price tag. We had:

Cheese burger spring rolls - this comes over a lettuce leaf which you wrap around the spring roll and eat. This was really rich and crispy. I loved the lettuce used because it added a freshness you needed to counterbalance the rich spring roll. This was overall, great!

Singapore slaw - always worth while! 19 ingredients all finely chopped with some dressing, I could have just eaten that. Amazing.

Slow Braised Beef - this was good. Not blown away, but good. Meat was soft, flavours went well together but all in all, just ok.

Peking & Char Sui Duck Breast & \"LUCKEE\" SHRIMP CHEUNG FUN - okay...here's where I took some issue with the cost vs. what you're getting. Note I am not a food connoisseur by any means, just someone who loves food. I found this was comparable to getting peking duck and cheung fun at any Chinese restaurant, just fancier. Clearly there were more ingredients and there were bigger chunks of duck and shrimp but flavour-wise, very similar. 

Service - very friendly staff and great service

Atmosphere - loved this! Kind of classy/tacky but it works. Music was so loud I never hear much of what the staff said about the dishes they brought out. 

Why I gave 3/5 when it sounds like it was so great? It was! Just not blown away by the food but the experience was awesome."}
{"text":"Summerlicious Dinner 2015.

Here's the long and short of it: Quality throughout. Top-notch food, knowledgeable and professional service, awesome ambiance. Asian duck confit was outstanding - very unique and palatable twist on the traditional dish. Definitely will return.

{"text":"Amazing food from beginning to end.  You HAVE to get the Slaw!  I could have eaten the whole plate by myself - the textures and flavors just get better as the slaw sits.  We chose the following plates to share, and our server portioned enough for the table:
- Green Curry Chicken: not as green as we thought it would be, not the favorite. best thing on it was the pineapple
- Caramelized Cod: favorite dish. Cod was cooked to perfection and flavors abundant but not too overpowering, could still taste the fish
- Thai Satay: again not as amazing, could have had a better dish elsewhere
- Wild King Garlic Shrimp: slightly spicy, juicy and flavorful very good

Dessert, we had the ice cream, shaved ice, and signature Tong Yuen.  The Tong Yuen was bursting with rich flavors. The rose water in puffs with the Tong Yuen wasn't that great, and anticlimactic after the pastry balls, but definitely would get again - the display was extremely appetizing as well.

The mojito and raspberry martini are delicious as well.  The food is great, the scene is very loud so be prepared to talk loudly to each other!"}
{"text":"We had the garlic potato chips (awesome), the fried beefsteak tomato (delicious), the Orzo sauté with crab (spinach, pine nut, fresh pineapple, Thai basil, calamari, diced pork, wrapped in coconut & egg crêpe), the Slow braised beef with sour cream and shallots, and the wrapped apple tart with berry confit for dessert.  The food was some of the best tasting/looking food ever.  The service was great (we sat at the bar).  This was a truly amazing culinary experience for me...I was so in love with the food and the flavors and colors of the dishes.  

My advice is to go in a big group so you can order more and taste different dishes.  All hail to Susur the King."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Lunch
Venue: Lee
Specialty: Asian Fusion
Menu items: Famous Singaporean Style Slaw, Spicy Crisp Tofu & Four Satay

Working in the King West area, one definitely feels like royalty when indulging in any of the fabulous restaurants located on the King West strip. LEE, a masterpiece by chef Susur Lee, happens to be one of those restaurants where one can easily get to indulge in at lunch time.

Although I have not been to LEE for dinner, I can assure you their lunch menu will have you coming for more, especially during those rare days at work where you happen to have the time to sit down for more than half hour and enjoy a nice meal. 

Our lunch started off with the famous Singaporean Style Slaw.  According to the restaurant staff, the slaw is made out of 17 different ingredients, which make this salad a delicacy and a mouthwatering masterpiece.


Eating the salad is a ritual on its own. The waiter comes with the salad, tells us about the wonderful mysterious ingredients and proceeds to mix it in for us. It turns out the dressing needs to settle in, once mixed, for about 1 minute before you can start eating it...oh, the beauty of ingredients. Once all ingredients and slices of thin tortilla chips are settled in, the salad becomes crunchy and moist, but not watery or dense. It is just perfection at its best.
From what I tasted, I noticed hints of cilantro leaves, wine sherry vinegar, peanuts, sweet onion, lemon zest and bean sprouts. Clearly, I am missing over 10 ingredients here, but this is as much as I could grasp from the salad. I guess you will need to try it on your own and tell me what else you discover!

Next up, Spicy Crisp Tofu. Not being a vegetarian or a super fan of Tofu, I decided to try this appetizer and give it a shot. 


Well, this was worth the shot! The dish is basically composed of big pieces of good quality tofu, lightly battered and deep fried with a wildflower honey soya chili glaze, golden sand, topped with fresh basil. The combination of the chili with the soy sauce, sugar (cane?) and basil, make this yet another hit by Chef Susur.

Our order of appetizers to share finished with the Four Satay. A very sweet end to our degustation.

 
Let's just say the presentation of this dish was the show stopper. The basket-styled dish, which seemed to be a thin rice cake mix, was delicious. Once we dug in it, we found fresh chili mint chutney (brings memories of Ravi Soups), peanut sauce, Kung pao sauce, all mingling and coating pieces of shrimp, beef, chicken and pork. Of course, having had non-protein \"appies\", it was about time we introduced protein to our meal. Yet another hit.

For those of you who are highly interested, LEE is only open for lunch between 11:30am - 2:30pm. Also, if you can't make the time for a dine-in meal, LEE offers certain items of their lunch menu for take-out, just call ahead and ask them if they can hook you up!

Bueno Provecho,

{"text":"This is our second time at lee. I think it's good, the Peking duck is the best. Their wine is a little overpriced ($16 wine in LCBO is $52) and it's all stuff you can get at the LC (nice to have wine you cannot find, right?) but that seems to be a trend in Toronto. Had the satay, was not impressed; it was not bad, but definitely not great. They recommend at least three items and we were stuffed after two. I could see eating three if I was starving but would be leaving very full. We are big eaters too. Order you food one at a time or they bring it all at once and the food gets cold. Service was very good."}
{"text":"Ambience is great, staff is great and most importantly the food is great!

Got the Susur's Signature Singaporean Style Slaw, Top Chef Green Curry Chicken and the Korean pepper marinated striploin.

All three dishes were amazing both presentation and taste wise. You can really taste the flavours come alive on all three dishes. Just try them for yourselves and you wont regret it.

The staff was friendly and helpful the moment we got in and out of the restaurant, you can tell that they really do care which makes the whole dining experience a whole lot greater.

With all that said I'll definitely come back to try out the rest of their menu.

Solid \"A\" rating."}
{"text":"Top notch all the way around. Service and menu was 5star. Great apps, cocktails and an even more intriguing dinner menu. Must repeat"}
{"text":"It was our second time at Lee and this time for my wife's bday celebration. We tried so many dishes and we liked almost everything (just the curry chicken wasn't very exciting i thought). As expected and remembered the food was fantastic. So many flavors in every dish. For such a high end restaurant i think the portions were very generous too. Lee is a type of restaurant that not only you get a one of a kind culinary experience, you won't walk out planning your burger stop on the way home. 
The service was also great and our waiter was super nice and attentive. We were a party of four and we were sharing all the dishes so when we got the two way tuna (which normally comes with two tacos) they gave us two extras so we all could taste the dish. The tuna was my favorite dish of all by the way. 

I would definitely be back. The Singapore slaw alone is enough reason for wanting to come back.

{"text":"This is a fabulous place. Everyone is so happy to accomodate you. I specified that my food needed to be vegan and everyone who played a part in serving our table specially noted that every dish put in front of me was absolutely vegan, which was highly appreciated. I had the slaw, artichokes sans parmesan and the tofu lettuce cups (as well as the basil cocktail our server recommended, made with vodka. A few of these!) and all the food was excellent. The service was high end and the vibe was upscale yet friendly and relaxed. Susur Lee came out and greeted the table beside us (I guess they were a big deal haha) and he seemed extremely nice. It was cool to see that he still puts in work despite his fame. I am definitely going to try and come back at the next possible oppourtunity. 

Maybe it's just me but I don't really understand the hysteria over the slaw? It's quite sweet, a bit too sweet for me.  I guess my dining partner talked it up so much (saying it was the best thing they've ever eaten) that it was difficult for the dish to live up to it's acclaim. I certainly enjoyed it though, and would not hesitate to recommend it or order it again."}
{"text":"Got there around 6:30 and it was just beginning to fill up. The interior is gorgeous, kitschy asian art on the walls, high ceilings and lounge style seating. Very nice vibe. I believe Susur Lee's handsome sons were serving us. They were very courteous, I never felt rushed or pressured. Definitely one of the reasons the restaurant seemed to be flowing so well.

While we waited for the rest of our party we ordered a bottle of wine. It was reasonably priced. Also ordered the Singapore Slaw (w/o sashimi) since I've heard very good things and the Cheeseburger Spring Rolls. 

Singapore Slaw: HUGE, gorgeously presented, festive...I actually just came back from celebrating Chinese New Year in Singapore and I saw these dishes everywhere. Way more interesting than what they offered in over there, however. Lots of nuts, flowers, sauce (fish sauce, dark sauce?? not sure). Incredibly delicious, everyone at the table loved it.
Cheeseburger Spring Roll: So spicy so tasty, I would've ordered a few more of these next time. 
Ribs (we got both styles): One was definitely better than the other (can't remember which), but both were cooked so well, meat fell off the bone.
Braised Beef: Soooo melty, this is my idea of comfort food. Needed a bit more flavour though. 
Carmelized Cod: Cooked very well but I found that it didn't go so well with the turnip cake, it all kind of mushed together (which is something I'm ashamed to say I usually enjoy). I also didn't find the fish to be that fresh. But my opinions were contrary to the others at my table.  

They say that this is a tapas restaurant and suggest ordering about 7-10 dishes for 6 people. But the portions of the mains are massive, and all in all we ordered 4 mains and 2 appetizers and it was more than enough for 6 of us. We couldn't really finish it to be honest. They do their meats very very well, need a little more complexity going on in the flavours but we enjoyed our meal.

Would I be back? Yes."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience from beginning to end.  The food was everything I expected and more and the service couldn't have been better.  We had the signature slaw dish, Luckee shrimp cheung fun, cheese burger spring roll, slow braised beef, and last but not least signature French and Chinese tong yuen.  All the dishes had an amazing combination of sweet and sour flavours with a variety of textures to match.  Every bite left you craving for more.  The cherry on top was meeting Chef Susur Lee where he was gracious enough to stop at our table and we even snapped a picture.  Not a night I will soon forget."}
{"text":"Oh Lee- you could've been so great! 

The more Yelping I do, the tougher I get it seems. I am an eternal optimist, so therefore have great expectations for most every new restaurant I visit.

Chef Sisur Lee is one of a kind. A gem. A guru in Toronto and abroad. Hence my expectations for Lee Restaurant were sky-high. My date and I shared roughly seven dishes of various sizes and flavours. We were only impressed with one! The Black Cod (though named differently on the menu).

We found every portion over-the-top huge and starchy to the max. On an a la carte menu, I don't think you should add potatoes to a red meat dish. Let the customer choose a starch from the a la carte menu to accompany. We also found everything extremely sweet; syrup-like in fact. The Watermelon Salad was more like a dessert than an appetizer.

The Positive? Lee offers really, really great cocktails with unique mixtures of liquor and fresh fruit. But we didn't come for the cocktails..

In this competitive market of Toronto Fine Dining, you gotta impress me a lot more to earn my repeat business. Unfortunately, Lee won't be getting my second visit any time soon."}
{"text":"Big fan of Susur Lee on Top Chef Masters and after finding out he had restaurants here in Toronto, made it a priority to check it out.

Things got in the way and it took almost a year to finally pull the trigger, but this weekend the wife and I finally got to check out Lee.

Couple of notes:

1)Susur himself was there, wandering around and checking in on people, talking to staff, and just being a presence in the restaurant. AWESOME. 

2)Wife got the Diver Scallop dish. I got the Braised Beef. We shared a Singapore Slaw to start.

The Diver Scallop dish was the best seafood I've ever tasted. To be fair, I haven't tried much as a I'm a staunch anti-seafood guy for the most part, but it was just incredible. 

The Braised Beef was great, very tender, melt in your mouth, creamy goodness. It could have used a touch more seasoning but that's nitpicking.

The Singapore Slaw is, as most have said, a must-have. The amount of flavors and textures in the dish were amazing, and I could literally eat that every day.

3)Staff were incredibly fun and knowledgeable on all the dishes, and I was incredibly satisfied on that end.

4)Atmosphere was really fun, the music was great (Gangstarr for like an hour? YES PLEASE). It was noisy as hell but I didn't have a problem talking to my wife and it made up for the fact that the tables are REALLY close together, so you don't end up hearing everything the people next to you are saying.

5)Cocktails are a bit pricey but delicious. The Japanese Margarita with Sake was good on the first sip and delicious the more I had.

Honestly I can't say a bad thing about the place that wouldn't just be nit-picking. Highly recommended, a great Toronto experience."}
{"text":"Lee is just not about the quailty of the food but the servers are very knowledgeable about it and they explain you details that just adds more to the whole experience. Loved the lamb chops. must go for anniversary and birthdays."}
{"text":"Lee did not disappoint. 

We went for Winterlicious which is a hot ticket to get, and man was it awesome. 

We ordered from the set menu and they were even able to accommodate a vegan and vegetarian dietary requests. 

We ordered the Gluten free and Vegan Singapore Slaw also and let me tell you that for me was the highlight of the eventing. I would go back just for that slaw! Worth every penny of the 25 dollars it cost and was plenty for 2 people or more if ragging as an app. I personally could polish off the whole thing myself in one sitting! Soooooo stinking good!!! 

I would highly recommend Lee. If you want modern or \"nouveau chinois\" as they call it. I thoroughly enjoyed it! It's like Chinese with a French refinement twist to it. Very cool!!!"}
{"text":"I will give 4 stars for the food but 2 star for the service.  The food is great but I can not feel the paring service. We arrived restaurant close to 7pm during weekday so it wasn't the prime dinner time for them yet. After we ordered our food, it was difficult to locate our waitress and food came very slow despite the fact restaurant was not super busy yet! I told my server that no cilantro in any food due to personal preference but when the vegetable samosa came it was filled with samosa in it. Nobody had the time mention to me the dish contains cilantro?! She did ask me if I want to take it back to the kitchen but I already waited toooo long for everything. How much longer should I wait?! And during the long wait, someone came by with the wrong food. This restaurant has so much potential but cutting edge (expense) management style ruined customer experience."}
{"text":"Singaporean style slaw is a must try. Adding salmon or wagyu beef with the slaw makes it very filling. The luckee shrimp and grilled octopus are pretty tasty. And the cheese burger spring roll... tastes exactly as it sounds ^^ The dining atmosphere is live and the service is good."}
{"text":"Great food, but one of the worst service experiences I have had at a high class restaurant in Toronto. My wife is pregnant and we specifically asked if there was uncooked fish coming out in the pre-set menu. We were told no, and in fact there was an appetizer that had uncooked fish that she had a bit of before realizing it did have uncooked fish. We had drinks spilled on us... Drinks that took 10 minutes to come out (simple beer). 

Truly disappointed in the service and probably will go elsewhere for a large group. Unfortunate because my wife, friends and colleagues love this place... But due to the lack of good service we'd rather go to other high class restaurants in Toronto. 

To top it off... We had asked for separate bills and it all came as one and due to the size of the group, it was impossible to split it up... 

Pathetic service.... Poorly run... Won't go back..."}
{"text":"TOURISTS IN TORONTO: PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AT THIS RESTAURANT.

Food: Looks unique but mediocre and overpriced. We got Singaporean-style slaw and the award winning chicken dish. The slaw was great at the first few bites, but as I kept eating, it got less enjoyable. There was too much peanut in it which ruined the taste of 19 whatever ingredients in the slaw. The chicken dish was very small in portion, and its taste was really mediocre. I DON'T THINK THEIR DISHES ARE WORTH $30. 

Service: We had our most uncomfortable experience during our visit to Toronto right at this restaurant. The server clearly looked unhappy with questions we asked (we asked 2 questions. If you think that's too many, just find another job). Also when we asked why the Singaporean-style slaw is so famous, she condescendingly said \"Because it's fantastic,\" which wasn't true. 

Easily one of the worst restaurants I've been to. Totally ruined my mood that night."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food, environment, great staff, service was excellent and mostly Susur Lee himself came out and greeted people and took some pictures with his Fans, including my wife."}
{"text":"I went here for a girl's night the other week and was really impressed with the food! Susur Lee is a genius in the realm of culinary arts and everything I ordered from the shrimp to the duck was to die for. The ambiance is great also for a date or even after work drinks. Also, everyone looks great! Win in my books!"}
{"text":"3.5 star rating. I could eat the slaw all day, every day. I find the rest of the menu hit or miss in terms of flavour and presentation. The service has always been decent when I have gone."}
{"text":"I don't give out 5 stars easily, but I can safely say that Lee Restaurant exceeded my expectations.  Reservations are a must - and remember the restriction of cars on King Street West between Bathurst and Jarvis.  They don't take reservations for the patio.  To do that, you must call on the day of the reservation because it is dependent on the weather.  The phone lines open at 1:00pm to add that to your reservation.  We had reservations at 6:30, but arrived a little early.  That was not a problem as they seated us promptly on the patio.  You do sit close to others as the tables are close to each other, but you can peak over to see what others ordered.  Per other reviews noted, we had to try the Singapore Coleslaw - it did not disappoint.  There was an article in the newspaper about the nutritional content - low is calories and low in sodium (i.e. it's healthy).   The waitress suggested 3 dishes for 2 people.  We ordered the grilled octopus and the sambal satay.  The octopus was cooked perfectly - crispy on outside and soft and delicate inside.  A great fusion of chinese and indian flavors made this dish stand out.  The Sambal Satay was good and came with 6 skewers (2 shrimp, 2 beef and 2 chicken) cooked with a mild chili seasoning and presented on a papadam.  It came with 4 types of sauces for dipping.  This dish was prefectly cooked and seasoned and the dipping sauces enhanced the flavours.  We finished with a delicious creme brulee which was big enough for 2 people.  Fantastic service with a diverse taste and textures elevates this to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with three others. The restaurant was full for a Friday night. We started off with some appetizers. Singapore Slaw is always a must have no matter how many people are eating. We had oysters, you can never go wrong with oysters unless you get a bad one! Spicy crisp tofu, this was a little disappointing. It was not at all crispy. It was soggy and covered in overpowering sauce. Buddha Style Lettuce Cups were just ok. Peking and Char Sui Duck was pretty good. I'm not a duck fan but I would have this again. Grilled octopus was good too. It was done perfectly, not too tough. We finished it off with the slow braised ribs. It was just ok. If you're planning on going to Lee definitely order the Slaw, Peking Duck and Octopus. We also ordered the shrimp cheung fun but our waitress suggested we hold off in case we were too full after our last dish which was a great suggestion. We were stuffed and had no room for dessert."}
{"text":"I went back in June with my family and relatives in celebration of my cousins graduation, my Dad's birthday and a welcoming dinner for my cousin from Vietnam. It was an amazing experience from the service, the atmosphere and the food. Everyone was so polite, understanding and amazing with every detail on the food. My aunt and cousin from Vietnam enjoyed their meal since the food brought an interesting twist to Asian cuisine. My favourite was definitely the curry chicken and the famous slaw salad. The presentation of the food was very well done. It was nice experience and I was very full by the end of it."}
{"text":"Our flight got delayed and decided to eat out while we waited. My girlfriend suggested this restaurant and it was phenomenal.

Decor is nice, service is exceptional and the food....go for the 19 ingredient salad to start off and definitely add the luckee shrimps. I just landed home and must write this review.

I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great food 
And great decor. A little pricy considering You do need to get a couple of
Plates to leave full. Would likeTo come back here. 
The thing that pissed Me off was Seeing the girl that was waitressing on the patio last
Night was acting so rudely towards her collegues. You can tell there's a lot of
Drama going on with her. Surprised the managers havent fired her."}
{"text":"Usually, I would roll my eyes at the thought of any 'fusion food' but Susur Lee does an exceptional job of blending global flavours into something unique and palatable! 

Having been here a few times, my go-item (as referenced by several Yelp reviews) is the Singapore slaw. It's eye catching, unique and most of all - delicious! It would tickle the fancies of even the most vegetable-hating, utterly carnivorous individual! 

It's refreshing to have the waiters explain each dish as it's brought to you and how to eat it.  

Another item that is divine are the Jerk spicy pork ribs. I was never much of a Ribs gal but this placed has converted me!

As for dessert, the chocolate peanut bar and warm molten chocolate cake (interesting addition of caramelized jackfruit!) are very, very good!

Lastly, as for the chef himself, Susur Lee sometimes makes appearances from the busy kitchen to greet tables and take pictures with his fans. That sort of customer appreciation goes a long way!

This is also a great 'first date' and 'anniversary' restaurant. The atmosphere is trendy yet cozy, upscale yet unobnoxious."}
{"text":"Went here for winterlicious earlier this month and was impressed by not only the food, but the service as well. It was a little pricey, but for a \"treat yourself\" kind of night, it's definitely worth it. I had fried tofu, pork ribs and a chocolate peanut butter bar. All were done well with a unique twist. I'd definitely like to go back and try the regular menu."}
{"text":"Was a delicious meal for sure! We ran into this place unexpected and without any expectation, so it was a pleasant surprise. The slaw was delicious, but we were not disappointed with any of the food. The only complaint is that the 2 waiters were very hard to understand. It would have been nice to know everything we were eating."}
{"text":"Singapore slaw is a must, what an amazing dish. Beef crepe was also delicious."}
{"text":"Came back for my cousin's birthday, so far beat restaurant in Toronto! The duck was to die for. The scallops were also amazing and the lobster raviolis where from the gods....
If I had to go back I have no idea what would I order, every time I come a new dish surprises my palate. But obviously, I would always get the signature salad..."}
{"text":"Best Asian food in Toronto. The food is special and gorgeous. We tried Singaporean-style Slaw, Spicy Crisp Tofu, Wild King Garlic Shrimp, Korean Style Marinated Beef Striploin and  Rack of Lamb Thailandaise.  Every one of them is delicate and full of imagination. I strongly recommend Korean Style Marinated Beef Striploin. It is super rich and tender. Also Singapore Style Slaw is way beyond expectation. I have to say it is the best salad I have ever tried. It was an unforgettable experience. Though it is a little bit pricy, it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"The slaw. The slaw. Ya gotta get the slaw. 

This was the predominant piece of advice I gleaned from reading Yelp reviews about Lee. Everyone agreed the slaw was a 'must get'.

And sure enough, after settling in at this beautiful upscale dining room on a trendy stretch of King, plates piled high with Susur Lee's Signature Singaporean-Style Slaw continually streamed out of the kitchen. And guess what: the slaw--a vegetarian mix of soft and crispy noodles with other yummies and a peanut-y sauce--was awesome.

As were some of the other dishes we sampled, including a crab tempura special and the tuna sashimi / spicy tartar duo. However, the tomatillo/jalapeno guacamole (which sounded so promising) just wasn't my cup of tea.

The cocktail du jour was sangria, ceremoniously mixed tableside, and containing some insane amount of ingredients (did she say 72? That seems a bit high). And it rocked!

Also, the night we were there, Drake sat two tables over. He and his lady companion ordered cheeseburger spring rolls, which I definitely need to try next time. They also ordered TWO rounds of slaw! Meanwhile, Drake's bodyguard, who sat three tables over, also ordered the slaw!

Huzzah for slaw!"}
{"text":"I've been at the latest incarnation \"Lee\" about 5 times in 5 months. I love the place but there are some funny problems, outlined in this review.

The food is usually good but the service is usually bad. Sometimes comically bad.

They try to make up to it if you let them know -- so if you get bad service it is important to let them know. They will try to treat you right next time you're in.  I think Canadian's are generally too polite to give feedback but they would benefit from more.  The funny thing is that they can deliver a great service (when they are making up for a bad one) but their default service is pretty juvenile. It's not like the old Susur days when the place had a more exclusive air.

I think Susur understands food 100 times more than he gets service. Which is funny, if you know Susur's personality.  It used to be I'd rotate my rectangular plates by 15 degrees to watch the staff rush in and re-align them. \"Chef likes it that way\" is what they'd say, which is adorable to me and part of Susur's charm.

Now when they put a round plate down in front of me I play a joke by shifting the plate to the left, coyly telling the staff \"Chef likes it that way\". If they've been around a while they smile and get the joke immediately.

One time the staff (incl. chef's) screwed up the service amazingly (mains before appetizers, same dish for both of us but it was prepared very differently with different topings, missing drinks, missing dishes, huge delays, spilling, shift-change during meal with no context hand/off, etc...).  It was funny to have things appear that I didn't order.

Almost always the waiter comes to the table and asks \"Is this your first time at Lee's?\" -- their computer should show it's not the case.  Don't expect to feel like a regular here from the staff -- but Susur will recognize you as a regular and speak with you if he knows you.  He's let down by the professionalism of the staff.

I think it would take me about 4 months work to polish the crew to the level the food deserves.  The crew needs to work more in unison. Less repetition, more context on the diners quirks.

The crew at his other restaurant (Luckee) seem to be way more relaxed and we joke about \"Chef likes it that way\" with audible laughter.

So to be clear: I adore Susur and love his personality and his skill. I like his restaurants but the service is sort of sloppy and juvenile, even though it's well intentioned."}
{"text":"Very little can be said about Chef Susur's creations that is bad.  In a city where many have tried to do the \"fusion\" thing and failed (cf. Monsoon), he gets it right - probably because his training is actually chinese and his ingredient selection goes beyond soy sauce.  

It gets really crowded here, so a reservation is definitely advisable.  Their menu changes every so often, but the wait staff usually have a good idea of what's good and what's great.  I always am happy that their Singapore Slaw remains on the menu as I always am sure to order a portion or two for my table.  

Oh, and once and a while, if you're lucky, Chef Susur might even come out and say hello!  He's a bit gruff, but who cares - his food speaks for him, and it's better than poetry. WOHO!"}
{"text":"The venue is divided into two areas, one offering more a lounge / urban / hip hop music atmosphere most of the time. Tables are kinda close and offer little privacy in some areas.

Expect to share and spend $20-30 on most dish, If not $12 on any desserts (no need to say but tiny spoons will make any desserts memorable)

There is some wait between dishes especially dessert but the service is well orchestrated and staff really attentive.

RSVP is a must."}
{"text":"Every time my husband and I pick date night dinners our favourite go to still is Lee's.  We live in Hamilton so commuting down to Toronto can be long but so worth it!

My keys to being a repeat customer, have amazing food, have staff that are on top of their game - who are friendly and efficient, keep all areas of the restaurant immaculate, have great music to listen to, have incredible cocktails, and accommodate my peanut treenut allergies without compromising the dishes - Lee's hit all those areas out of the park!!

We adore the Singaporean slaw, the cheeseburger spring rolls, the black cod, the jerk pork and the lamb.  Just try them there's no way you can't be hooked after eating here.  A few pics to get you on point with what I'm highlighting - just go and note it's a bit pricey but worth every dollar."}
{"text":"Expensive? Yup. Pretentious? You bet. Don't even bother showing up without a reservation? Correct.
But damn the food is good. The singapore slaw, their so called signature dish, is amazing but it was the caramelized black cod that won me over. The braised beef was excellent too, as was the jerk spiced pork ribs. My only complaint? Make the portions larger! But the food is so rich, you won't feel cheated but be prepared to pay up. Good food and great cocktails too."}
{"text":"Had a really great experience here for a special occasion dinner. It took a while for our food to come (they came one at a time until the end) but the highlight was definitely the ambiance, the food and the service.

Our fave dishes were the 19-ingredient slaw (as everyone has already pointed out), the braised beef (the beef just MELTS in your mouth and the mashed potatoes around are out of this world) and the famous curry - which came with a cute little block of rice that is deep fried, a ball of chicken, pineapple and delicious curry sauce. Presentation was very good and we ordered 5 to share for a party of five, which was enough to fill me up!"}
{"text":"Way too loud. Much too rushed. Told that our choice of a $61 dollar bottle of wine was \"drinkable.\" All in all, we didn't feel treated like valued customers. I will miss the slaw but will not return anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places in Toronto. Not only does the food taste amazing, but also the service was great, the staff are friendly and welcoming, and the ambiance was great! Would highly recommend the Singaporean-Style Slaw (which contains 19 ingredients). Would definitely go there again this month!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best food I've ever eaten!

That's a bold statement, I know, but until you've been here, you just don't know. Every bite that we had was just a perfect creation.

Susur Lee is a master at creating beautiful, creative, and extremely tasty food! His signature Singaporean Style Slaw is a must-order dish, containing 19 different ingredients. It's a salad, yes, a salad but it's one of the best things I've eaten in years. You have to try it!

My friends and I also truly enjoyed the Caramelized Black Cod, Top Chef Green Curry Chicken, Slow Braised Beef, and Wild King Garlic Shrimp. I've got my sights on the Jerk Spicy Pork Ribs for my next visit.

And then there's the dessert! We shared the Vanilla Bean Crème Brûlée and Mango & Passion Fruit Panna Cotta. If we weren't so stuffed, we would have each ordered a dessert.

Service was impeccable! It was our server that gently insisted and urged us to order a salad to start. Right on!

Our bill at the end of the night was very reasonable, actually less than we expected. Bonus!

Did I mention Susur's Signature Singaporean Style Slaw? Go there just for that!"}
{"text":"I just came here earlier with my coworkers for a Summerlicious meal.   Our server (Cristian) suggested the Chef's tasting menu and we decided to go with that instead.  It was the best decision we made and we enjoyed our meal very much.  There were about 6-7 dishes that were prepared (eg. singapore slaw, black cod, peking duck, etc).  We also had a lot of drinks.  They were expensive but totally worth it.  The Saketini was very yummy:)  Our server was surprised that we were able to finish our meal.  I guess when you're with 5 girls one might expect they don't eat a lot but my girls and I proved him wrong:)  I just want to say that it was excellent customer service and thank you Lee Restaurant for preparing our dinner and taking the time to explain each dish.  We had different cooks/servers come out to explain what ingredients were in the dish and we were very impressed :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful presentation, fantastic fusion of flavours, courteous and attentive service. I would expect no less from Susur Lee."}
{"text":"My manager and I were trying to make the most of our remaining few hours in Toronto by enjoying one last standout meal.  I tried to push a few ideas on him, but he insisted that most of my suggestions were not conveniently located to the airport.  Suddenly, I remembered that I had run past Susur Lee's restaurant earlier that morning, and his space was only blocks from where we were at the time.  My dining companion was intrigued by this idea, so we made our way over to the hip space to engage in our next foodie adventure.  

We arrived at the early hour of 5:30 pm, which was when the space had just opened its doors for dinner.  Shockingly, there were several other patrons taking in the flavorful Asian fare at that awkward hour.  We each ordered one of the fruity cocktails, which were sweet and refreshing on the warm Toronto evening.  We began our meal with the Singaporean-Style Slaw, which  contained a mix of shredded greens, sprouts, peanuts, and more.  It's spicy vinaigrette infused a kick into the fresh ingredients.  We also enjoyed the Caramelized Black Cod, which was perfectly glazed in a miso mustard sauce and Cantonese preserves.  The perfectly cooked, moist fish was served over the same grilled turnip cake I had loved at Susur's Manhattan restaurant, Shang.  The firm, square slice of turnip had been cooked to a slight crisp, but you could still discern the hearty flavor beneath its light char.  The Sauteed Jerk Chicken came artfully served in a bowl made from rice noodles.  The sponge-like consistency of this nest helped absorb some of the heat from the intense scotch bonnet sauce.  The tender chicken had been tossed with fresh vegetables and a sweet ginger and mango puree.  The dish possessed all of the components of a traditional Thai-style meal being that it was sweet, sour, spicy, and savory all at once.  The Rack of Lamb was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the chops were elegantly stacked over fried bananas and green curry lentils, all seasoned with chili pepper, mint, carrot cardamom, and coconut chutney.  The plump Garlic Tiger Shrimp were sprinkled with soy bean crumbs and plated with a cucumber and mango salad,  as well as sun-dried tomatoes, and a potato pea croquette.

Lee delivered a meal as innovative and creative as its eccentric chef.  The decor managed to be fashionable and fun, but still felt comfortable and relaxed."}
{"text":"That Slaw! 19 ingredients sound like a lot but the flavours blend perfectly and it's not overwhelming at all. If anything, you'll want more. 
The Peking duck and Korean style marinated beef striploin are some of my favourites. I also enjoy their desserts. Honestly there is nothing that I haven't liked so far. 

The service is excellent, the waiters are so attentive and friendly that you can spend hours eating dinner there and you will not feel rushed. It is easy to see that chef Lee pays attention to everything, not just the food. The look, the atmosphere, the service, quality, etc are all great. You can sometimes spot him outside the kitchen observing how things are running. I like how the waiters always explain each dish they bring to the table and they are happy to make suggestions when someone doesn't know what to order.

I have always had a good experience at Lee. This restaurant is anything but cheap and it's worth it. Great for special occasions."}
{"text":"Ordered the slaw to share and as I was chewing I found something crunchy- turns out there was a large piece of glass in my food!! They comped the slaw but the restaurant still had the nerve to charge me for my meal."}
{"text":"This is a must try! I have been here several times and the food is incredible everytime. Also nice the see chef Lee! The Waite staff are great at going through the menu and explaining the food as it comes. He slaw is a MUST try. 
The slaw is so amazing, I could eat this everyday and not be bored. I have tried most everything of the menu and recommend it all."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go here, but wasn't impressed with much past the slaw. 

We had trouble deciding on what to order so asked the waiters recommendation between the items we were debating, ended up with the garlic tiger shrimp and Asian pork dumplings. The flavors on the shrimp were great, I really enjoyed that, but the shrimp was so hard and rubbery. Maybe they were over cooked. Anyway, nothing is appetizing no matter how good the flavor is if you can't chew through it. 

The other dish, the dumplings, it just didn't work for us. Maybe I don't have refined enough tastes to appreciate the seasoning, but it was very heavily Asian-seasoned pork in an Italian type red sauce with reggiano cheese. Typing that out now, I question why on earth we would ever listen to the server's recommendation, but I would have expected everything on Sursur Lee's menu to be awesome. 

Again, the slaw was really beautiful (probably the prettiest dish I have ever had) and it was very delicious. The service was fine. Sursur Lee came out to a table that was seated near us because they asked to meet him-- that was really nice of him."}
{"text":"Was here for the winterlicious menu. Everything I ordered was fantastic. I had the cod and leek tart, the salmon and the dessert trio. 45 bucks a person you can't go wrong. The ambience is great with dim lighting and current music. Highlight we got to see susur lee himself walking around the dining room :)

The reason for the 3 stars is the service. I remember the servers name and would mention it but currently working in a restaurant myself I would hate to get him into trouble. The service was just slow and unattentive. In fact we wish we had the server that was serving the tables behind us because he just seemed to just love his job. Our waters were refilled by the hosts and our plates and cutlery were cleared by other servers. Our apps were brought out by one server and he described them when we put them down, the mains which took about 25 min after the apps not sure why, our server brought them out set them down and didn't say a word. When the desserts were brought out by another server and she described them to us again and cleared our empty drink glasses ...our notion of our server was confirmed. He just didn't care. I'm all for team service and maybe they pool their tips however when you are spending at least 80 bucks per head (dinner & drinks) you set the bar high. Very disappointing.
Unfortunately this isn't a restaurant where the manager is out and about regardless we wouldn't have complained in front of our server about him. However I hope this review doesn't fall on deaf ears!"}
{"text":"AMAZING

slaw - to die for
cheeseburger spring rolls- amazing
we had a 6 course meal - I was stuffed!! everything was great. I love how they customize items for your needs, its great. Everyone must try this place once!"}
{"text":"Food was really amazing!! The slaw is a good appetizer/salad to start off with. The lobster and shrimp ravioli is not like your typical Italian ravioli, it's more of an Asian style dumpling filled with lots of meat, very light and not so heavy. The scallops had a good mixture of flavors. Great atmosphere and very trendy. Service was good as well."}
{"text":"Another awesome meal.  My fav courses would be the slaw,  the cheese burger spring rolls and ribs... Great service,  fancy drinks and food ."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great drinks (the basil mojito!!), service was great. The hostess was pushy with drinks, always asking if you wanted more and making sure your wine glass was VERY full. The ambience is fantastic and modern. Great for a celebration and for groups."}
{"text":"I love Lee's vibe. Partly upscale, partly lounge, modern and cool décor. Our table (that could fit 6) was two benches with red velvet cushions and pillows strewn across them.

The service was interesting. What I really liked was that when each dish was brought out, a thorough explanation of what is on your plate came with it. They also have \"pop-up\" dishes, where a server walks around with some dishes that are off the menu, asking if you'd like to buy it, which I think is an interesting concept. What I wasn't a fan of was the pushiness. I know Lee is the type of place that is generally meant to be eaten sharing style, with several plates and each person trying a bit of each, but my party did not want to. Our server a.) seemed to be pushing this on us and b.) kept trying to push more plates of food on us. He was nice enough, but the pushiness really gave a salesman kind of vibe that we could have done without, and tarnished the experience a bit.

The cocktails are pricy (generally $16-18ish). I went with the Sangria and honestly, it was the best Sangria I've had, so I didn't mind dishing out a few extra bucks! Not skimpy on the alcohol content, and full of a variety of fresh fruit. Yum.

I opted to go with a big ole plate of Jerk Ribs with a ginger and mango sauce. I like my spice a bit lighter, so I was worried at first, but I found the spiciness just perfect. Though that being said, since I like mine  a bit milder, someone who is looking for a spicy jerk may be a bit disappointed. They were good - though I would say nothing stood out about them that would make me order them again. 

I also tried the peking duck that was also good (served to eat in a pancake like a wrap and you put them together yourself), though I felt the duck perhaps a bit overcooked.

I was eyeing a friends Cheeseburger Spring Rolls - they looked delicious! I will definitely try them out if I come back!

For the dessert I had a warm chocolate banana cake with a homemade marshmallow dressed with coconut that came with some sort of sorbet or ice cream that I can't recall the flavor of. Again, it was okay, but nothing spectacular that stood out.

I tried some of the chocolate peanut butter ganache bar and it was decadant and fantastic - highly recommended if you're looking for a rich, delicious dessert.

Overall a good experience, and a neat place to check out at least once. The menu has some really cool variety, so there is something for everyone! Though in terms of Susur's restaurants, I'd definitely say I prefer Bent."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, clean and distinctly Asian. Urban, multi-cultural diners and friendly, seemingly worldly bartenders - Dennis, who is self-proclaimed well-traveled and younger Mike, who is eager to tell me about the Chef's exploits and help me get a tasting menu going. Teak abacus banisters accent the ceiling over the marble bar, white orchids and orange snapdragons adorn a vacant end of the bartop. Red neon beckons from the busy street entrance. Beyond the entrance and bar is a small dining area for maybe fifty. Distinctly 80's decor, clean lines, horizontal and vertical. It's busy in here. Conversations drumming out a vague bass and snare.

I start with my usual - a chilled tequila blanco shot and lime wedge. Tonight it's Don Julio in a rocks glass. The first wine for pairing is brought up, a very cold Niagara Reisling. First course are two raw oysters (from Massachusetts, if memory serves) complimented by a variety of spices and herbs. On the side are grated horseradish and a small halved orange citrus to sprinkle over the oysters. It's a good and tasty start. 

Second course was a sample of the Chef's famous vegan Singapore Slaw, which has so many flavors competing for an unrealized dominance, and a crunchy & soft texture to it that I love. 

The third course coming is a fennel-crusted scallop with a grape orange confit and a butternut squash reduction, along with a caramelized asian lettuce rectangle that resembles sushi to be enjoyed with a section of pan-seared black cod. The latter two pieces enjoyed together touched on sense memories of books I'd read or pictures I'd seen in said books about a simpler time - smokey, warm, intensely earthy, almost dream-like in its flavors. Unbelievably delicious. If I had eaten nothing else today this alone would have been enough to satisfy my tastebuds for at least the next twenty-four hours. 

Next comes a dish that both Mike and Dennis are quick to tell me won Top Chef Masters with the highest score ever tallied on the series. It's chicken thigh, rolled, with curry and pine nuts, edible flower petals and leaves, crispy rice roll, and roasted pineapple. It has a bite to it that hits the throat minutes after eating. The flavors are intensely bold without being overpowering. I tell Dennis the Chef seems to know what he's doing. Dennis replies, \"I believe the word, 'genius,' applies.\"

Following the award-winning chicken thigh is a pineapple crudités with a raspberry and mint leave garnish served in a cocktail-dessert glass with a sundae spoon. The wine is now a pinot noir, although it's not a big pinot because Mike doesn't want to overpower the food. Gelatinous iced pineapple is a nice light break to prepare me for the next dish.

Braised beef- a beef cheek braised over 24-48 hours and served in another cocktail-dessert glass over mashed potato & leek cubes and under a mild horseradish cream. One might mistake it for a chocolate parfait from the looks of the dish. So tender, the beef is eaten with the same sundae spoon that came out with the pineapple crudités.  Very beefy flavor, the potatoes ground it perfectly. It tastes almost British, like a haute shephard's pie.

I get to cleanse my palate before the next dish comes out, which I've been told is lamb. A glass of McManus cabernet is poured to complement the incoming lamb. Finally, the shank arrives with a mint & mango chutney, a bitter root native to Ontario, and the shank itself is resting on cherry lentils and a hunk of toasted banana. Jesus. I don't normally go for lamb, and the lamb with mint sauce is positively British, but this dish is so good I want more. I mean a lot more. The mint and banana compliment the lamb and the lentils ground the flavors perfectly. The dish brings me back to what Dennis said earlier and gives me to reflection on the descriptive, 'genius,' which is overused in general. What qualifies as genius? I suppose it's entirely relative to the milieu, and as it relates to the combining of flavors and textures, I could certainly be impressed to call Chef Lee a genius. His work tonight has, at times, transported me via my senses from the barstool to places within the recesses of my imagination. Places I know only from dreams.

Finally, dessert. A rice dumpling spoon shot filled with chocolate and hazelnut and under which sits a surprise - a thin slice of baby grapefruit which serves to cleanse the palate for the pastry, filled with creme brûlée and rose water, that comes next. This second bite is described by Dennis as a palate-cleanser but that's an injustice. Lastly is a mango-peach panna cotta with tapioca pearls and a gooseberry on top that is, simply put, silky sweet sex on a spoon if you're into that sort of thing. I paired these deserts with another chilled shot of Don Julio and lime. What a finish. Coup de gras.

I highly recommend Chef Lee and Lee Lounge for locals and travelers alike."}
{"text":"Our favorites were their sangria cocktail, Singapore slaw, and their seafood special showcasing shrimp, scallop, oyster and crab. The green curry chicken was good but not something I would try again. The service and style was top notch. You could just come and get a table and today's weather was perfect for their patio. I really enjoyed my time here."}
{"text":"My partner has particular tastes when it comes to food (and to be honest,  many other things), and so shot down my offers of Canoe or Bymark for her birthday dinner. Of course, she couldn't (or wouldn't?) be helpful and offer any alternative locations in return. Luckily, I struck gold - managing to decipher her various disparate remonstrations - by surprising her with Lee. 

Note: there's no sign on the outside of this establishment, and we could only confirm we were at the right place by looking at the Dine Safe tag (green, natch). Look for the wood/reddish restaurant just east of Conviction.

The two-tops were a little closer together than I'd prefer, and overall the restaurant was pretty noisy; larger groups seem to be more popular here, and it fits the style of food. Our waiter was extremely helpful and attentive, and recommended four dishes for the two of us. Not one to listen to direction, my date ordered five.

We had: (1) garlic potato chips, (2) Mexican goat cheese tart, (3) Singaporean style slaw, (4) orzo saute with crab, and (5) slow braised beef.

The waiter forewarned that the dishes come out rather haphazardly, and indeed they did. For example, the slaw came out first, and was all we had until about halfway through it (and there's a lot of slaw). We were then blitzkrieged (or the Chinese-fusion equivalent) with the remainder of our dishes, filling our table. Rather than be forced to polish off the slaw early, I would have preferred to have the slaw available throughout the meal to counter the heavier mains. Oh well.

As per the other reviews, the slaw is indeed very popular (saw a lot of it going to other tables), and our waiter promoted it as well. Honestly, I wasn't blown away. I've had versions of this dish before to celebrate CNY, and though it is a superior interpretation, it's still just a shitload of shredded veggies. Like I said above, nice to have almost as a side salad, not particularly strong on its own.

The chips and tart were great. The tart, though a bit lonesome on a plate by itself, was packed with tasty olives and goat cheese. I love anything orzo, and the thai-curry flavour was unexpected and great. We were surprisingly stuffed by the time we got to the braised beef, but still managed to crush this large hunk of meat. I was a bit disappointed with the taste: I expected it to be significantly different from typical Chinese braised beef dishes...and it wasn't - but the texture was fantastic.

Booze was expectedly expensive: bottled beer (no draught) was $7, and cocktails were $14 (eep!). Despite being stuffed, we still ordered dessert. The chocolate molten cake was good, but the stuffed apple crisp was phenomenal.

Re-reading this review it's sounding a bit critical, but we had a great time at Lee. It was definitely on the high-end (including tax and tip, $190), and we may hold off for larger groups, but we'll Susur-ly be back again.

Bonus: Susur was actually there, mingling around. Isn't he supposed to be in New York?"}
{"text":"Well, well, what can you say about Lee....other than that the food really is fantastic.  On many occasions I've eaten here, the quality of the food has always been completely consistent.  A lot of the nights, you can see Susur himself walking through the restaurant to check on guests personally which is nice to see.  

Their Singaporean slaw with a gigantic mound of crispy noodles, veggies and edible flowers is so good that I have to order it almost every time I'm there.  It's somewhat of an experience as your server brings out the towering salad and mixes it for you right at the table.  The well-balanced (sweet tinged) dressing is a great compliment to variety of textures present in this great salad.  

Melt in your mouth seabass and fork tender pork belly (both no longer on the menu :()are all superbly executed.  Although the portions are not big, after sharing 4-5 dishes between two people, we were happily full."}
{"text":"Lee's was such a great experience! Perfect for a special occasion - the atmosphere was romantic and the interior design was . 

We read a lot about the Singapore slaw (which the waiter also recommended) but we opted for the spicy crisp tofu, black cod, and chef chicken. All were amazing. 

Service was good, and price was as expected $$$$."}
{"text":"If you come here, you must get the signature slaw. It is soooo good and I'm not the biggest salad fan either. 

I came here with two other friends very last minute, on a Friday night. They were able to sit us by the bar area with no wait time. The servers were all super friendly and having coat check was a plus. 

In addition to the slaw, we got:

- Buddha style lettuce cups: very mediocre 
- Assam Thai satay: mediocre, the sauces was what made this dish interesting 
- Peking Sui duck: very good. Different than the typical Peking duck, would definitely recommend. 

The service here is really good and I love how they explain to you exactly what is in your meal when they bring out the food. 

The atmosphere here is very welcoming and a nice place to sit down and grab drinks after your meal. 

Definitely would recommend this place! Just be careful in what you order because for the price you pay, you want to ensure the food you get is worth it."}
{"text":"I didn't know how I'd like the Singapore Slaw. I had heard great things but how much can you do with Slaw? A lot apparently. Every ingredient the chef chooses has a purpose and isn't too strong but you can taste each part. We loved the atmosphere. Not romantic at all as you're shoved in like sardines but the service and food was A+. Definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"Best.effing.food.ever! Everything was delicioso...we started with dirty martinis.  Had the Korean style skirt steak, Garlic shrimp, Spicy crisp tofu, curry chicken.  Save room for the panna cotta!  Bring your wallet."}
{"text":"Our family came together in Toronto and had dinner at Lee.  Everyone in our party was completely overwhelmed with how amazing everything tasted!  Chef Lee has a phenomenally unique and perfect way of fusing Asian and European cuisine.  If you're in Toronto, don't miss this experience!  Make sure to have the Singapore Slaw and the Black Cod.  You will not be disappointed!

The private dining room (our group was 18 adults) was very contemporary and unique as well.  You have to go through the kitchen to get there.  Very cool!"}
{"text":"The food was great here, you could tell that the food was conceived by a master chef. Great flavor combinations. We had the special (fried soft shell crab), crunchy and served with an amazing sauce, jerk pork ribs (amazing- spicy, tender and flavorful also served with a tropical fruit sauce) and the tempura maki crab roll, more subtle but also very good. The service was good and ambiance was very nice. I had the lee lemonade, great ginger kick, it was really tasty. Wonderful dining experience"}
{"text":"Food was great! I recommend the ribs and the duck. They are definitely must haves. We really enjoyed our cocktails as well. I had the burnt orange Manhattan which was awesome. Our server was great in giving us suggestions for the best \"Lee\" experience! Definitely a must when visiting ! Can't wait to check out the other places he has."}
{"text":"Food is good, I've been going to this restaurant for many years.  It seems the portion size has increased and the prices even more.  Yes get the Singapore slaw.  However it was brought literally 30 seconds after we orderd it.  We were still drinking cocktails and they brought the wine.  Awkward.  Mains came very fast as well.  The timing was off and rushed.  I also personally don't like having different servers for different courses.. For a fine dining establishment the service was below par.  Mains were good, black cod better at Nobu, lobster ravioli the star, with big chunks of lobster with beurre blanc sauce.  For just under 300$ for 2 cocktails, 1 bottle of wine, slaw, 2 mains and 1 dessert it is pricey and i would have expected better service.  Oh and seating is very cramped.  Good for tourists.  There are better value for money options in Toronto."}
{"text":"Servers are very pushy and recommend ordering 6 plates at $30 each and 3 apps and a few cocktails. 

When I placed my order the server said I know you want the spring rolls but how about the chicken and spring rolls and the slaw. 

The food is ok..... but the servers are pushy. Makes me uncomfortable. 

The topping options are 25% 20% or 18%. Nothing else."}
{"text":"This restaurant has two of my favourite dishes I've eaten ever, anywhere in the world, full stop. They are:

1. The Singapore Slaw, and
2. The Caramelized Cod.

The green curry chicken with pineapple is very good too.

The restaurant itself in my opinion is pretentious and too noisy. Bay Street and 905 types sit crammed next to each other and their loud voices reverberate against the hard walls, along with blaring music, making it difficult to hear. This is exacerbated by the fact that the tables are very long and they seat you unusually far away from your partner. The service is okay but a bit cold. I remember one time (and this admittedly is an aberration) the waiter introduced himself by saying \"if it seems like I'm not paying attention to you, I'm not, I've taken __________\" and he mentioned a drug's name that I didn't recognize. My wife and I -- who are not illicit drug users -- found that odd. But this waiter said something explicitly that sometimes comes across implicitly  -- this restaurant is too cool for you.

But I have to go back to the food, and in particular those two amazing dishes. They will keep us coming back once or twice a year or so."}
{"text":"The food was insanely good--the whole party loved everything (although next time I'd pass on the sashimi with the Singapore slaw, it didn't really add).   We had a ton from the menu, and almost everything was terrific--slaw, tofu, duck, beef (both braised and strip), edamame.   (Could have done without the tomato & beat salad and the pop-up dish, in hindsight.)   Really, the food could get six stars--one of the better meals I've had, although I admittedly like a lot of Asian fusion, which I get is a \"you is or you ain't\" kind of a thing.  

But... the service.  To be clear, the servers we had were nice, as was the host.  But they were nice in the way that really good sales people on commission are nice, not in the way that great waitstaff are supposed to be nice--they were just incredibly pushy.  Don't get me wrong, it's not enough to keep me from coming back, but it really isn't what I'd expect from a place of this caliber."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!! Visiting from the states and this was the best meal I've had in Canada yet. Phil was our waiter and was more than helpful. If Phil is serving you are in for a great night!"}
{"text":"So different type of food I went on winterliscious it's absolutely amazing I wish I could've met susur lee next time I go I want to try his signature slaw. The atmosphere is very nice and also the design or the restaurant  but price is pretty expensive I had the popcorn soya chciken  and the three amazing desserts Panna cotta was my favourite I could eat that 100 more times"}
{"text":"The slaw is delicious and did not disappoint!   Hard to believe something so delicious can also be vegan... We tried a few other appetizers as well and the short-rib main, both of which were incredible.   Great for sharing. 

Service was impeccable, although now we realize it's probably due to the Lee brothers / celeb dad docking tips and pay if they receive a complaint about a server.  Horrifying treatment of employees and very shameful on their part... #Sad."}
{"text":"Great experience all around. Starting from the charming atmosphere, the veery friendly and professional waitress and finally heavenly dishes all around. I loved the sharing concept. It allows us to share many nice dishes in a veery comfortable pace. This is so far the best I experienced in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great slaw. I had the braised beef didn't impress me nearly as much, overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I definitely have mixed feelings about Lee! We came to eat as a group of 6 last Thursday, when friends were visiting from out of town. Here's the deal:

The pros:
-Friendly service and good explanation of dishes on the menu
-Very accommodating - we did a $65 chefs choice menu and they accommodated peanut allergies and vegetarians (vegetarian actually got her own individual servings of veg dishes when the course brought for the table contained meat)
-Decent food and interesting dessert

The cons:
-The 'scene' - very loud, very hot, and very dark. Hard to have a conversation, especially with someone at the other end of the table. Tables are also really close together where we were sitting so overall felt very uncomfortable.
-Very expensive. We left very full but it ended up being way more expensive than I'd anticipated. I'd suggest ordering a la carte, even with the $65 meal (the cheapest option for chefs menu) I think we got too much food. 
-The food wasn't AS good as I hoped for the price. I'd heard so much about the singapore slaw but feel like I could've made something similar at home. The fried chicken was good but a little dry and could have been hotter.

Overall we had an okay time but I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"My new goal is to try everything on the menu. Our experience here was so good it might've just taken first place for places to eat out in Toronto. Complex flavours, unique items. If you haven't been you must go, I recommend sharing a few dishes. We had the Singapore Slaw, Pulled pork tacos, green curry and a decadent chocolate peanut butter cake. All 10/10 for me!"}
{"text":"Went to Lee on Dec 21, 2013 with my wife. We parked across the street, and easily found the restaurant despite it lacking a name out front. We were greeted enthusiastically by all three of the host(esses) who took our coats and saw us to our table with smiles and warm wishes. 

Our server and his assistants made the evening for us. With great advice on what to order, wines to compliment it, and fun chit chat as they came by to pamper us.

We ordered the Singapore Slaw as a shared starter, the slow cooked beef and the Green Curry Chicken as our Main dishes, and topped it off with a couple of the daily special desserts. We tried the Bubbly Sake with our appetizer, and a pleasant but unmemorable white wine with our mains.  

Each dish has been well described by those with a greater command of their foody adjectives. We will just add we really enjoyed the food, and the service. The ambiance was a little \"Hard Modern\" for our taste, but we sat comfortably and despite the room being full, we had no trouble chatting amidst the general hum. 

We will return, but will order different dishes, just because that is why we go to restaurants!

You will find this place pricey, about $100 per person with wine, plus tip."}
{"text":"Food was good - we ordered the famous slaw, Thai red curry, samosas and chocolate lava cake. The dessert was my favourite part. The servers were alright."}
{"text":"This place has a whole new dinning experience for you. Every time they bring your food they take the time to explain it to you, including its ingredients. They do take allergies seriously too! Food was amazing, never tasted food like that before. Great experience! I will defiantly be back"}
{"text":"Toronto trails less behind New York's restaurant game with this gem. Great trendy scene, amazing food and presentation, and impeccable service. The Thai slaw salad, Edemame, and forerro Roche inspired dessert are must haves! There was an amazing truffle Gorgonzola gnocchi special when I was there that needs to become a menu standard. Can't wait to head back the next time in in the six."}
{"text":"This review is based on my second experience dining at Lee this past week. My boyfriend & I came here to celebrate our anniversary. It was definitely memorable.

Lee (like true King St. Fashion) is tapas/sharing plate restaurant. Everything comes out one at a time & you're encouraged to share. 

We started off with the Singaporean style slaw. I'm not even going to try to describe it. It's been almost a month & I'm still craving it.

I got the cheeseburger spring rolls. They looked small at first, but these were so filling. It kind of reminded me of my mom's lumpia but with cheese. My boyfriend got the black pepper charred tuna & spicy tartare. It was a generous portion & we definitely didn't leave anything on the plate.

For dessert we got the sweet rice dumplings. These were absolutely amazing. They were served individually in ceramic spoons. There was an orange cream sauce you pour over the dumpling, which made the warm sticky rice sweet. Also on the platter was these cream puffs which had the perfect chocolate nutty taste. 

I was unbelievably full after this meal. The staff was awesome. When each dish was brought to the table, they described each ingredient. Our server was also very attentive It's also worth mentioning that Lee offers an equally epic cocktail menu. Get the Niagara, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I remember being a student and going with my boyfriend at the time soon after it opened. This was all we could go for a nice dinner as Susur was clearly out of reach and we kept the number of dishes to a minimal. My naive palate liked the duck confit roll, but finding the matchstick potato too greasy, even tho my then food-critic idol Joanne Kates gave it high praise in the Globe.

Visiting my family last Feb, we wanted to go out for dinner on a wimp. This being Winterlicious, we couldn't get a table at any place I longed to dine at while living there: Bymark, North 44, etc. 

I called Lee and they said they had tables. Hopping into the car right away, we got there 8 something. Good thing too as the place start filling up after we sat down.

Considering nobody were known for a big appetite, we decided on 7 dishes. While ordering, the waiter mentioned that oyster special at Madeline's could be brought over. As a family, we just don't pass off oysters! Then suggesting we would do with a bit more,  he sold the Singaporean style slaw pretty hard, so we gave in.

The seafood were definitely the better choices. The 3 oysters per person (one perserved lemon, one hot sauce and one I didn't remember) all tasted very fresh and worked well with the accompaniments. Salmon ceviche was good but about standard. The spice crusted diver scallop was cooked just about right,with nice spices.

Also memorable was the slow braised beef, so tender, rich and flavourful. I normally believe only in medium-rare beef but this is an exception. However, the duck confit roll was not the same as yesteryear, while still good the wrapper was doughy instead of crispy spring roll wrapper. 

The mexican goat cheese tart and spicy crisp tofu were not very memorable but I guess we ate them rather happily. But plenty of the tomato beet salad and Singaporean style slaw were left at the end of the meal. 

Especially considering the waiter hyped it so much the slaw was a let-down: it has a good texture of crunch of crisp but no, you can't taste all the flavour components as some are stronger than others. Maybe it's the anticipate and how it was not met!

As for dessert, the creme brulee was good. I liked the panna cotta but the berry ravioli with pineapple wrapper on top, while interesting in concept, was hard to cut with knife or teeth.

As for service, maybe my family were not the hip crowd they were catering to, so the waiter didn't come to check on us after all the dishes arrived. I felt he was also overselling us more food than we could consume and pushed the slaw too aggressively. 

With a tab of about $300, i have to say I could do a bit better. Either I have outgrown it or this place has gone down since its Susur Lee days..."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good! Kind of hidden in King West, took me awhile to discover, but totally worth the $$$! Great experience :)"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner as a surprise from my husband. Never heard of the place, but have definitely heard of the chef, Susur Lee. It's definitely an Asian fusion restaurant.

On the recommendation of the waitress, we ordered the Signature Singapore slaw, (the picture is attached) as our appetizer and it was absolutely delicious!! It has 19 different ingredients (which I can't name all of them). You'd think they would be too overwhelming or that the flavours would get lost, but they don't. Every bite is like a new discovery of flavours in your mouth and they're all amazing!

When you're ordering, keep in mind that all the dishes are designed to be share dishes, so the more the merrier! They are fairly large in size (like the slaw says it's for two people, but I think it would serve four if you only take one helping and are ordering a few other dishes). For our main dishes, we ordered another Signature dish, the Top Chef Roasted Curry Chicken and the Peking Duck Char Siu wraps. 

I'm going to start with the Peking duck wraps because I'm a big fan of the traditional Chinese style Peking duck wraps. To start off with...and don't get me wrong...I really do like the traditional style wraps, but these wraps blow them out of the water with their variety of flavours! If you're familiar with regular Peking duck wraps, they come with the wrap, crispy duck skin with a bit of meat, green onions, cucumber and Hoisin sauce.  These wraps also come with those toppings, but their Hoisin sauce is made in house and they come with so much more! It includes their own house made cranberry rhubarb compote, pickled ginger, foie gras, maple mustard, meaty duck pieces, char siu (BBQ pork) and these little strips of crunchy something or another. It's up to you what combination of ingredients you'd like to put in your wrap. I combined almost everything except the maple mustard and foie gras (both of which I am not a fan). Aside from that, the flavours combinations I tried were absolutely fabulous! These flavour pairings put the traditional Peking duck to sleep!

Now on to the Signature Roasted Curry Chicken...it was super moist and by the suggestion of the waitress, when you eat a piece of the chicken with curry on top paired with the pineapple, it really brings out the flavour of the curry. It is marvelous! I have not tasted a curry like this before. I can't even describe it.

Believe it or not, we also decided to order dessert and I'm SOOOOO happy that we did!!! I ordered the mango passion fruit panna cotta.  Oh my gosh!!! First off, it includes all of my favourite Asian dessert ingredients: sago (mini tapioca balls), coconut milk, black glutinous rice, mango and passion fruit flavours, mango mousse, caramel coated rice puffs, and panna cotta.  The flavours all combined together are deliciously exotic!!! I would even dare to say that I have now found my all time favourite dessert!!! That's saying a lot!! I probably could've ordered another one just for myself, but that would've been selfish and glutinous.  

Overall, this place is definitely a five star restaurant, not only because of the food, but because of their service as well. The various waiters and waitresses who were serving us were very helpful and pleasant. They all knew the dishes and their ingredients well and could answer any of our questions as well as make suggestions on what to eat and why. I would definitely come back to this place again to try their other dishes and to eat the same dessert and try one of the other desserts I was eyeing!"}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of Susur Lee since his appearance on Top Chef Masters - all of his dishes looked phenomenal and unbelievably tasty!  So, when I saw that his restaurant, Lee, was on the roster for Winterlicious 2012, I jumped/lunged at the opportunity and quickly made a reservation for my boyfriend and I.  

$35 for a 3-course meal?  Awesome. 

The good:

- my saketini: very tasty, good mix of sake and vodka with a slight hint of sweetness

- sticky rice with jerk chicken: Susur's take on this Jamaican classic...AMAZING.  The sticky rice had the perfect steam and texture, and the chicken was almost like duck - super tender, flavourful, could just pull it off the bone with my fork.  STRONGLY recommend.  

- dessert:  my boyfriend had a kind of chocolate cake thing.  NOM.  

Overall, some high points, some low...mainly the low being the service.  Dude, if we don't want the Asian slaw the first time you ask, we probably won't the next three either."}
{"text":"Singapore Slaw, Singapore Slaw, Singapore Slaw, Singapore Slaw, Singapore Slaw. 
The dish that made Susur Lee famous and justifiably so. It's unique, its delicious and it's unlike anything you would have ever tried or could replicate at home. Sure it may seem expensive at first, but when the server brings you the giant mound of salad and you see the level of detail in each of it's perfectly cut ingredients, you'll get why you're paying twenty some dollars for a salad and you'll keep on doing so. 

Having been here 2-3 times now, I can safely say I've enjoyed all of my dishes and the consistency in the level of food and service. Beautifully decorated and comfortable to spend an evening with friends or a significant other, the restaurant is always busy, but never intrusive or too loud. Whenever I have friends visiting Toronto with me, I love bringing them here because the dishes are so creative and well executed. Aside from the Singapore Slaw which is an absolute must, I recommend the lamb and the octopus as well. Both were delicious and prepared so well. I didn't love the cheeseburger spring rolls, but have friends who absolutely love them so give it a try! They're different but good. 

Price wise, we ordered five dishes between four people which came up to approx. $40 each person after tax and tip. I don't consider this expensive for the quality of food and type of restaurant. Portion wise, we were full with the five main dishes. Some people may regard the serving sizes to be small (and they are compared to say the Keg), but the complexity and richness (without being heavy) of the food contributed to the feeling of satisfaction which may have in turn attributed to our feeling of being full. All in all, I would come back and I have. It's a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great food and service was efficient.  Seating is a little close and music was too loud.  The cod and slaw were both 5 stars."}
{"text":"The Asian slaw is awesome. Food is pretty good, but service is sometimes hit or miss."}
{"text":"I sometimes meet chef Susur Lee at my local yoga. I became curious about his culinary talents after having a few yoga classes with him and learning he's a celebrity chef, and his restaurant is super close to my place. 

I got reservations for a busy Saturday night and the hosts were very attentive. The place is super loud and crowded, don't go if you're interested in a quiet romantic night.

Overall everything is more about presentation than taste. Everything looked awesome, but tasted much less awesome than I expected. We didn't order the incredibly famous slaw, if you are interested. 

My shrimp... I got to say. I've had better shrimp for much less in Chinatown. For real. The sauce was fantastic, but the shrimp itself had little taste, like it didn't marinate for long enough, you know? A seasoned kitchen team (no pun intended) should be able to marinate shrimps better than anyone in Chinatown. Hence the disappointment. 

The bill was too expensive for the experience. I'll very likely never come back."}
{"text":"had to tried it, been here only once. Not a fan. Everything was too sweet and gingery for my taste. I had the famous Singaporean salad which i noticed every other table had ordered too. Also had the pekin chasiu dish. It was interesting to find that they use fried bean curd as oppose to duck skin to give it that crunch. The service was really good. They were very attentive to everything. Our glass of water will never be empty, there is always someone coming over to refill it. This is a place that once is enough."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in the city! It's well worth the price for the amazing quality of the food. Koodos to Susur Lee, my favourite chef! I am picky when it comes to Asian fusion food but this restaurant exceeds my expectations. It's like China meets France for the quality of food. I always come here for a great time with my girlfriends or special occasions to celebrate milestones."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing. My friends and I went on a road trip to Toronto during Memorial day weekend (I know, i know...how patriotic of us), and went here for dinner on our first night. Not only was the food amazing, but the service was also really great. My friends told our server I had a food allergy, and they were very accommodating. We had the chef's choice (tasting menu) for six, and if the plate contained something that I might be allergic to, they would bring me something different that what my friends are having, which, in a sense, made me feel special. But am I glad I can have that 19 ingredients Singaporean Slaw, because it is soo soo good. My friends are all carnivores, but they can't stop saying good things about it, even going as far as to asking me to remake it for them. They also raved about the Cheeseburger spring rolls, which, sadly, I didn't get to try. Also, I ordered the Espresso Martini, and I swear I think I've found my crack."}
{"text":"We started our meal with the Singaporean Slaw, and it quickly came apparent why so many people name Lee when listing the best restaurants in Toronto. The slaw has a perfect balance of freshness, crunch, sweet and salty. If I returned to Lee this dish would definitely be reordered. Or perhaps I would go for lunch and only order it just for myself.

After the slaw we had the Cheeseburger Spring Rolls. Although a bit messy, these were fantastic. They are like a cheeseburger inside out. And I love that the lettuce wrap gave it some freshness that some deep fried spring rolls are lacking. I also really appreciate when restaurants do spins on dishes that you can't find anywhere else, or in your frozen food section at a grocery store.

Next came the Watermelon Feta Salad. This dish was perfect for sharing as it comes with 8 cubes, so it feeds a group of 4 perfectly. The watermelon chunks were big, as well as the feta. Combined with the olive, balsamic vinaigrette, jalapeno, and mint... it really was a spectacular dish. I would definitely reorder this one.

After came the Crispy Tofu. The crispy tofu was good, and I especially enjoyed the glaze. It was also nice and crispy on the outside and smooth in the middle which made for a great contrast of textures. If I had to choose between the Watermelon or Tofu though, I'd go with the Watermelon. Also, the crispy tofu comes in 6 pieces, compared to the watermelon's 8.

And finally one of our mains arrived, the Braised Beef. The beef was not over powering and definitely had an extreme melt in your mouth factor going on. The star of the dish for me though was the puree, which was super smooth and velvety. I don't care how much butter was put in it, it was worth it. Super delicious.

And lastly we had the Top Chef Green Curry Chicken. The highlight of the dish for most of the table was the rice cake. I kind of wish more rice cake came with the dish it was so yummy! I also thought the green curry sauce was to die for, and the chicken chunks were a good size. If top chef judges get to eat this kind of food all the time, I would consider them very lucky! If I had to choose between the braised beef or the green curry, I'd go with the green curry. It was also easier to share.

I totally would recommend Lee to visitors from out of town who may only be here a short time. Totally worth it. And also, if you live in the city and haven't been, I'd recommend it as well."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I've ever had.   The service was great even though the restaurant was busy .   Every dish was different and there wasn't any that we didn't like.   Defiantly one of the go to places in the city"}
{"text":"Like many diners, my husband and I were smitten with Chef Susur Lee following his appearance on the television show Top Chef Masters and have been wanting to eat at one of his restaurants ever since. So, when we realized we would be celebrating our 3-year wedding anniversary while in Toronto, the choice of restaurant seemed like a no brainer!

As far as first impressions go, when we arrived at Lee, the setting set the already high bar for our expectations even higher. The decor is very swanky, with an upscale urban Asian vibe to it. You feel trendy and high class with your first steps in (though I will say that the signage outside of the restaurant leaves something to be desired in terms of readability... it wasn't until we got right up to the door of the restaurant that we were certain we were in the right place), so we were certain we were in for a top notch dining experience.

We had originally been planning to take advantage of the Summerlicious special, but our waiter informed us that for first-time diners, Chef Lee offers a \"Chef's Order\" menu which is priced comparable to Summerlicious, but the chef himself chooses the dishes and lets newbie diners try some of his personal favourite dishes. Considering that Chef Lee was in the kitchen that very night, we quickly decided to do that. As a result, we wound up eating: Singapore Slaw, a new scallop dish with potato croquettes that Chef Lee was trying out for the first time, Top Chef Green Curry Chicken, and Vanilla Bean Crème Caramel for dessert. Every dish was BEAUTIFULLY presented and truly a feast for the eyes, and the flavors were all very good too, but I have to admit that nothing we ate really blew us away. Given the price and the accolades Chef Lee has earned, we were expecting truly daring and exciting food, but our meal, while tasty, didn't really feature a single dish that was so delicious or revelationary that we could see ourselves craving it and coming back to eat it again. The dessert was probably the tastiest thing we ate (if we could have licked the plate clean, we would have), but the rest of the meal, while good, was not really exceptional or all that memorable. Nothing was bad (though we did think our scallops tasted slightly less than fresh), but we were honestly expecting a more exciting meal than what we got. 

One thing I should note as being EXCEPTIONAL was the service we received. Our waiter, Seth, was extremely conscientious and convivial and we were treated with a degree of care that was really impressive. My husband had mentioned when making our reservations that we were celebrating our anniversary, and when it was time for the dessert course, a second tray accompanied it that included a candle and the words Happy Anniversary. It is little details like this that I believe earn customer loyalty, and it really meant a lot to us that Lee was clearly invested in making sure our special meal was in fact special! The service alone deserves 5 stars!

All in all, Lee offered a solid dining experience. Although the food did not live up to our expectations, the service and ambiance certainly elevated the experience and we left largely satisfied. For a one time dining experience, it was fine, but I did not feel that the dishes were sufficiently special or impressive to warrant the price tag that normally accompanies them, so while I am happy to have had the chance to have dined here, I think it will be the only time I do."}
{"text":"Came here during summerlicious but I was actually not interested in the summerlicious menu. There is an a la carte option but you don't get to order from the full menu, which was kind of disappointing. 

The ambiance was very nice, pink see through tables with reddish light tones throughout the restaurant. Very cute for a date night! When we sat down, there was a girl with a cart serving sangrias. Couldn't resist the temptation, I ordered one. It was a gorgeous drink with flower pedals, but the taste was not up to par.

Of course, we ordered the slaw and it was amazing. Crunchy and refreshing on a hot summer day. The portion is big, I think it can pass as an entrée salad. The green curry chicken was very good as well, perfect balance of sweet, tangy, and spices. We also ordered the duck, it was okay. I was a little disappointed with this dish, there was just too many sauce and little add-ons on the plate that it was overwhelming. 

Overall a great experience. Be prepared to drain your wallet though."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Lee since we moved to Toronto earlier this year and I must admit that this is quickly turning out to be the kind of place where the food is great, atmosphere is electric and service is top notch. The service was a bit rushed but we did not mind it since we were all super hungry. The plates come out as they are ready and are meant to be shared family style. Last time we were seated at the bar and it wasn't a comfortable experience but this time around we got a nice table for 4. We instantly ordered the sangria pitcher. Their sangria was unique in the sense that they blend 10 different fruits and use peach liqueur and prosecco. This one was knock your socks off good. We ended up ordering 5 different plates of food which was perfect to be shared amongst a group of 4

My personal favorites
* Singapore slaw - yummy !!! How could I not order this last time around. Next time I will eat the entire thing myself (or maybe share a morsel or 2 with my wife). Just order this, no questions asked!!! The server mixed everything up at the table. It seemed like there were a lot of components to this dish although it looked pretty simple. I could get subtle hints of ginger which added a nice balance.

* Black cod with caramelized onions - Again, the mere mention of black cod gets my mouth watering. Very well composed dish although it is difficult to share between 4 people since the portion is tiny

* Top chef green curry chicken - I wanna be a top chef judge if this is the quality of the food that is put out under such severe time constraints. Simply wow !!! I actually think I liked it more than last time although the dish is still prepared the same way. The pineapple was a nice touch to the dish

* Mango and passion fruit panna cotta with coconut sauce - Beautiful way to finish a fantastic dinner. Simple dessert but something you can keep going back to without feeling guilty.

Some dishes that did not necessarily wow me but were still good on their own
* Lettuce wraps with summer corn and the works - This had a mexican twist to it with cotija cheese. Perfect for the season but overall the flavors were muted (didnt really cause a party in my mouth)

* Lobster Ravioli - Loved the XO sauce but wish there were more of it .. 

There is also a guy going around upselling dishes from the sister restaurant - Bent which is an interesting option for the instinctive souls. This would definitely be the place I would take family and friends to !!!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service! Do try out the slaw and the octopus. I would definitely go back. My only complaint is the noise level: my partner and I had to yell at each other at the table."}
{"text":"Lee has always been my favorite go-to place. When I want something crunchy, tart and refreshing, Singapore slaw always comes to mind. The cod is also amazing, as is the beef. It's do soft and melts in your mouth! Dessert is always a favorite and if I see molten chocolate then I ALWAYS leave room."}
{"text":"Went for a pre-theatre dinner last night and it was my third visit to Lee. The staff weren't quite done their pep talk/meeting when we arrived one minute past our reservation time, so we were left in the foyer to wait. Not exactly first class but not the end of the world. Coats were taken and we met the first of our 5 servers, which is just how it goes at this restaurant.

We ordered the Chef's Best for two and four dishes followed that were just spectacular. We had the slaw, cold-pressed octopus, scallops and lamb. They launched a new menu last night, and we were served the very first cold pressed octopus, personally prepared by Chef Lee. The flavours in this food are mind-blowing.

There was about a 40 minute wait for our final dish which pushed us cuttingly close to our show time. Our meal took 2 hours and 15 minutes so don't go here if you're looking for a quick bite to eat! Our server, Brandon, was an endless source of entertainment, very attentive, and up to date on current celebrity news.

Overall, you can't fault Lee Restaurant despite the minor hiccups, so I'm giving it a 5 star. We'll be back for our company holiday party in December in their private dining room (accessed through the kitchen so you can see behind the scenes!) so I'll do another review after that."}
{"text":"W O W

I was never a fan of Asian Fusion - or fusion anything. Lee, with a 4 star rating on Yelp and serving Fusion Cuisine, did not convince me enough to go in the past. But everything changed on a late Sunday night when I was starving and most restaurants in downtown were either closed, or required reservation. Lee was open, I called and the lady on the other side of the phone informed me that no reservation was required at that time.

After arriving at Lee, we realized how underdressed we were. Despite the jeans, track pants, and t-shirts, we were still warmly greated by everyone at the restaurant. Our server was so patient and friendly, even though we just wanted to order ASAP and eat. 

We ordered the Rack of Lamb Thailandaise, Top Chef Curry Roasted Chicken, and the Signature Singaporean Style Slaw. I wanted to add tuna to the Slaw but our server assured us that the chicken and lamb was enough protein. 

The wait for the food was reasonable since the place was fairly full with couple large parties around us. The Slaw was first served with the server mixing it up for us. Wasn't expecting much even though they emphasized the word \"signature\" quite a bit, I was COMPLETELY mind blown by how much I loved it. I would probably like it much more with some protein in, but I had to agree with our server about the other dishes. The Lamb was amazing too...definitely surprised me with the mintiness of the lentil sauce, but it was unique. 

And onto the award winning chicken, which deserves a paragraph all to itself. Huge pieces of chicken (not talking about small nugget size), with curry that was not overpowering the taste of chicken, had a lovely sweet touch of pineapples decorated on the side, I don't know how much better the dish can get. The highlight of the dish is the tenderness of the chicken. I never thought it would be possible for such large chunks of chicken to be so tender, it was almost melting in my mouth.

Last but not least we finished our amazing dining experience with Signature French & Chinese Tong Yuen. I have to admit there was a bit too much going on with this dessert, but every single bite was something interesting and unique. 

I drank quite a bit of water that night and my glass was never empty for more than a minute or two. Service here alone deserves an award.

Lee has changed my perspective on Asian Fusion. It's a place I will take friends and family who are visiting from outside of Toronto, as it so perfectly presents the Asian multi-culturalism. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here for a date with my boyfriend on a Saturday. We were seated in the back room at a 2 person table. The atmosphere is extremely loud, dark, and loud. The tables are situated very close to each other unless you have your own table in a larger group, so it's not ideal for intimate dates.

We got the must get which is the Singapore slaw salad - I'd expected a lot more after hearing all the hype, but it was only pretty good. 

My favourite was the rice rolls, my only qualm with that was the size - it's too big for 1 bite but you can't really cut it up or take multiple bites or else everything falls apart.

I'd really wanted to try the tang yuan desert but was a little too full after the slaw and 2 entrees shared between me and my boyfriend."}
{"text":"Wow! If you want to impress someone....please take them to this restaurant. Our experience started off with a very friendly hostess. Our waitress was fun and very knowledgeable. She recommended delicious appetizers & cocktails. Every time a different dish was served the food runner took the time to explain what we were about to sink our teeth into. Also, based on the chefs suggestions it was highly recommended that we eat our shared dishes in a certain order.
I was very impressed with that! The food was so good that I wanted to LICK my plate before the waitress took it away!! You gotta try it! I LOVED it!"}
{"text":"I have been to Lee twice (once in 2011 and once in 2012) and both times have enjoyed the best meals I have ever had in Canada. 

I do think 4 menu items for two people (what they recommend) is far too much. The slaw, a fish dish, and a meat dish would be the perfect amount. On my first visit, for 3 of us, we ordered 7 dishes, which was too much. 

The Singapore Slaw (which tasted different each time) is insanely delicious. The duck pancakes are difficult to eat but tasty. The spicy shrimp was my favourite after the slaw. The Top Chef green chicken curry is divine but we were too full to finish it!

The cocktail that has a restaurant-made ginger beer base is really tasty.

The service can't be beat although some servers seem a bit on edge...nervous about the high standards, perhaps?

I will definitely return. The food and service is absolutely worth the price."}
{"text":"Went here a week ago for my girlfriends birthday dinner. We always had wanted to try the famous slaw!
We ordered the slaw, her the Cesar and myself the sangria (another famous drink) we ordered the beef on the side with the slaw. I was very impressed by the whole thing! The crunch of the slaw, the customer service, the sangria and especially the beef! Wow I almost ate the whole beef! 
Because we only had the slaw which was satisfying but not super filling we indulged in dessert. 
This is where I was disappointed. My partner got the famous dumplings filled with chocolate and something else, and I got the pannacotta. It was a hard decision between that and the brûlée. 
The thing my partner got came with a sweet fruit juice and was everything was just overly sweet and sour on the palette. My dessert was downed in some soup like substance. It was okay but again too sweet. Pannacotta should be served without sitting in liquid. 
I would come back again to try the octopus and brûlée. The food is good and I think the price for to people was fair."}
{"text":"Scammed at Susur Lee's Restaurant I couldn't believe it. We had a group of fifteen and the waiter suggested he can bring a favorite of dishes to the table for $55 per person and we agreed it would make it easier. The first two rounds of food came before any of the drinks got the table. Some drinks only should after the third time asking. Now this isn't the first time I received bad service but in a restaurant as busy as this one I was very surprised. The waiter brought so much food that the last 2 rounds of food nobody can eat. When we got the bill we noticed that the waiter had charged us $85 per person for the food not including taxes and gratuities of course. When we asked the waiter he changed he's vocabulary to \"starting from $55 per person\". I explained the situation to the manager and he says they do this all the time. SCAMMED. This situation happened a few months ago and I still can't help thinking about it that it got me to start yelping. I do have to say that the food as always there is good. I have gone to Lee's at least a couple dozen times and used to recommend it. Unfortunately I can never return especially since I am 22yrs in the industry and know how this should have been handled."}
{"text":"Lee is one of the best Asian fusion restaurant in Toronto. We had the signature Singaporean slaw, cheeseburger taco, caramelized black cod, and finished off with his famous tong yuen and creme brulee fusion dessert. 

Everything was fantastic - ambient environment, attentive and friendly servers, and heavenly food. I highly recommend the slaw and cheeseburger tacos. The most memorable part of my meal is the delectable dessert - it is a MUST. 

I loved every minute of my experience at Lee. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, pricey but well worth the money spent, hip & trendy vibe.

For special occasions or if you need to impress someone, this is the place.

They take their food ingredients, preparations and final presentation seriously, The staff are well trained to explain each dish and are prepared to make recommendations if your brain is too overwhelmed by the many choices & descriptions.

As some have mentioned, their Singapore Slaw is da bomb, a must try"}
{"text":"We were here during summerlicious and ordered both from the summerlicious menu and the regular menu.  Menu is tapas/sharing style.  The Singapore slaw is definitely worth having (signature dish!) as were the spring rolls with the hot beef/cheese filling, you have to be a cheese fan though.  Another dish we would definitely order again was the Luckee Shrimp.  Presentation for all of these was awesome!  The octopus and cod taco from the summerlicious menue was ok as there were neutralizing flavors in the ingredients and we could not figure out what we were eating.  The dessert trio platter from the summerlicious menu was barely ok, felt it had been put together for summerlicious without much thought - a risky strategy, forcing us to order their chocolate peanut butter bar from the main menu which was delicious due to the very complex layers.  Overall I would come here again and stick to the signature dishes from the main menu.  Service was good (error on bill was fixed promptly) and ambiance was great as King street was very busy with the Saturday night in crowd and the restaurant was full.  We also hung out at the Bar before our meal and that was an experience in itself, definitely gets my vote for a stop on the King street bar hopping scene!"}
{"text":"I used to love Lee, but i have to say, it's not what it used to be.

From the guy who used to make the most exotic salads with ingredients i've never heard of, Sussur may have stepped his creativity down a bit to run his national restaurants.

That being said, i'm not saying he's not a good chef, i'm just saying my last two visits have disappointed me. 

The flavours are all familiar now and seem a little confused. I can definitely see a pan asian influence now (not just the orient, but east asia as well) and at times i find too many competing flavours in his food.

I just don't get blown away by Lee anymore. And it's not the novelty that has worn off, it's his food not being like it used to be."}
{"text":"Good for ambiance and group gatherings but not for food. Everything was simply ok, the chef braise beef was \"trying to hard\". It was mixing different sauces to achieve a \"complex and in depth taste\" but it failed as it just doesn't taste good."}
{"text":"Having seen Top Chef Masters, I've always wanted to try Lee Susur's restaurants.  I went in with very high expectations knowing that Lee was named one of the \"Ten Chefs of the Millenium\", and was not at all disappointed.  The meal at Lee Restaurant was the best I had in Toronto, far exceeding the likes of Mistura, Scaramouche and the ever-so-popular Guu.

My GF and I ordered four dishes and two desserts, of which I strongly recommend the Singaporean slaw.  If there is one thing you should get, order the slaw.  We ordered it plain, without the sashimi, but I could definitely see how the fish could add an additional dimension to the already perfect salad -- something I'm looking forward to trying in the near future.  The salad honestly tasted better after each and every bite, so I would suggest ordering at least one salad for every two persons in the party.

We also ordered the black cod, but I went a little overzealous with the lime juice and made it slightly too sour.  The turnip cake underneath was a delight.

The top chef curry chicken was probably my second favourite dish of the night.  The strong S.E.A. influence completely took me by surprise, and I absolutely loved it.

The last thing that came was a special duck dish that was not on the menu: chashu duck (basically peking duck with a twist).  The dish came with some bbq'd duck pieces, a foie gras mousse spread, crispy tofu skins, various traditional peking duck condiments and pancake wraps.  The tofu skin provided the crunchy texture that replaces the duck skin of peking duck (to my understanding) which I thought was genius.  It was a fun and engaging dish, but I would probably not order it again.

We ordered a banana cake (meh) and a \"French Tong Yuen\" dish for dessert.  \"Tong yuen\" is a traditional Chinese dessert dumpling made with sesame paste wrap inside glutenous rice flour.  This one was essentially that, but with chocolate ganache, peanuts, sesame and a few other things instead.  Amazing.

The overall dining experience was great.  We called at about 9 PM on a Thurs. night, and got a reservation at 9:30.  Our waiter was attentive, and very knowledgeable of the dishes and gave us well appreciated recommendations.  The ambiance was lively, and the decor was very unique.

Four dishes, two desserts, two drinks, came out to slightly over $200."}
{"text":"Overall had a great experience at this restaurant today. Trendy restaurant in a trendy neighborhood. This is a great place for a Date as the ambience is nice and it isn't too loud so you can still make conversation  (mind you I went around 630 on a Thursday so you experience may vary). Wait staff were friendly, knowledgeable and attentive even though it was busy. The wait for the food once orders go in can be a bit on the long side. Either way the all the food we had was presented very well and tasted great. We ordered the signature singapore slaw (as good as they say it is), the top chef green curry chicken  and the spicy tofu. All were excellent and proportion  size was appropriate (not too much but not too little). This place is on the pricier side with most entrees running close to 30 dollars. In the end our bill without drinks or desert came to around 90 after tax and tip. I would come back."}
{"text":"Went to Lee for their summerlicious menu however ended up getting a bunch of things off the summerlicious a la carte menu.

One thing that I've heard over and over again is that you cannot complete your visit at Lee without trying their Singaporean-style Slaw, and when I tried it, I was not disappointed. The carefully selected double digit number of ingredients for the slaw blended amazingly, it was light but filling at the same time. It was sweet and had a ton of texture and crunch that I personally love.

Overall, you can't really go wrong with any of the choices, my friends and I all got various dishes and they were all on point which shows the Sur Lee skill and consistency. (No wonder Drake eats here)"}
{"text":"Dinner at Lee in Toronto on Wednesday, June 5th, 2013.

Lee, Toronto, ON
Food: Asian Fusion.
http://www.susur.com/lee/

Overall: 4.1/10 vs. restaurants priced $$$$/5.
Ambiance: Very Good.
Food: Ok.
Service: Needs Improvement.
Wine/Drinks: Needs Improvement.
My rating scale: Exceptional, Very Good, Good, Ok, Needs Improvement, Terrible.

Overall: This is my third time to Lee and once again, the overall experience was a disappointment. I've already given Lee way too long of a leash having gone three times; I will not be back again. Lee just cannot deliver on service and are 0 for 3.

Ambiance: If vibe and ambiance is all you care about then Lee is your place. The interior is modern industrial and trendy. The patrons are attractive, the service staff is attractive, the music is cool and it's located on King Street West in a great location. When I was in my 20's I would have thought Lee was \"it\", but now that I'm in my 30's I am looking for more.

Food: The tuna was ok, nothing to be excited about. The curry chicken was quite tasty. The chicken chow main was a miss. 

Service: For a restaurant at this price level, the service is extremely poor and it's evident from the moment you walk in...too cool for school. Unfortunately it's a trend and not a one off experience because this is my third visit and Lee has missed on all three occasions. The hostess should greet incoming guests and make them feel accommodated, \"want to have a drink at the bar while we get your table ready?\" or, \"we'll be right with you\"...something. A blank look with no response just doesn't cut it. The table and kitchen servers are understaffed and it's quite noticeable by their hurried behavior. When a waiter says, \"I'll be back in a minute or two to get your drink orders\" a guest shouldn't have to search for the waiter and track him down 5-7 minutes later to get the drinks. There is a flow around the timing of the food at dinner, and when the guests start looking around wondering when the food is going to come out, it just makes for a poor experience; the time between courses is much too long. The waiter brought the incorrect drink out for a guest, on my second visit, our reservation was at 9pm and the food still coming out at 11:45pm. We were a group of 6 and the waiter accidentally threw on an extra $100, which is a mistake the staff just can't make.

Wine/Drinks: Limited wine options by the glass, but I acknowledge guests aren't going to Asian Fusion restaurants for their wines. The cocktails are priced $16-$18, which is too expensive.

{"text":"So many good things about this place.

The servers are pleasant, like really pleasant and they know their menu.

Do - Order the Singapore slaw. Yes. Order it. Even if doesn't sound interesting, just order it. Probably the best slaw you will ever have. 

Do - Order the Green curry chicken. Not sure what they put in it but it was Ah-mazing. Not your stereotypical Thai curry but better.

Do - Order the Korean steak - so perfectly cooked, you probably want to kiss the chef's hands.

Don't - Order too much, We had 4 dishes and we were 2 people (guys). We were beyond stuffed.

There was absolutely nothing bad about the experience. They don't need to change anything but keep it the way it is."}
{"text":"My family took me here for Mother's Day dinner tonight.  Wonderful idea as I love Asian food & have enjoyed this place in years past.  Sadly they sat us in the very back of the restaurant behind the kitchen in a very dark section normally used for private dining after they told my husband we would be seated at a table near the bar area on higher chairs/tables (which I was looking forward to).  Did they think that just because we had 3 kids (who are quite mature teens), that we should be relegated to the back?  They tried doing this to another large party who had one look & walked back out asking to be seated in the nicer area.  Wish I had done the same.  If we were a private party, it would've been fine but the noise carries in this enclosed dark room & we were sharing the room with the most obnoxiously loud all-adult group, one with an irritating laugh.  We heard everything they said but could barely hear our own party for the noise.  Foodwise, the Singapore slaw is good;  Cheeseburger Angus Beef lettuce wrap great; Poached Salmon not fresh; Thai Wild Cod Fritters decent; the Red Curry Chicken (a cross between Indian & Thai) was not good enough to have more than a few bites of.  Dessert was nice but nothing to write home about. Total bill for 5 of us was $443. including only 2 glasses of Prosecco.  For that price, we should've had better ambience & GREAT food, not the \"back of the bus\" with food that was just ok.  Susur, you are slipping.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Fancy restaurant apparently.
Creative dishes apparently.
Wonderful services apparently.
Expensive everything apparently.
Chinese +western food is attractive!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I am from LA and I was here exploring Toronto. I stayed at The Thompson hotel and went here with my toronto friend. Food was really good. All the flavors and quality was good. The portion size was also pretty big. It was a wed night and the place was packed. I would come here again whenever I am back in Toronto."}
{"text":"I went here for summerlicious today and it never fails to disappoint. Please try the Singapore slaw and the cheeseburger spring roll. The servers are all knowledgable and friendly. So much thought is put into this menu that you will be pleased with everything you eat."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing. Singapore Slaw with Wagyu Beef, cod and rack of lamb. Great service too."}
{"text":"Awesome food, hip location, good looking people and perfect place to celebrate our anniversary! Definitely have the slaw, cheeseburger rolls, tacos and brisket! All were delicious! The cocktails are also very well made. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious  highly recommend
We got the vegan slaw with 19 ingredients to start with and it was so tasty it made me want to be vegan...until the beef tacos with goats cheese arrived 
Also tried the blackened cod which melted in your mouth, the luckee shrimp was a taste sensation and my colleagues enjoyed the chicken green curry which I didn't try
Cocktail (raspberry mojito) was nice too although a tad overpriced at $18 considering it's served in a very small glass"}
{"text":"Asian Fusion is a phrase that conjures up attempts at bringing together Asian and (generally) European cuisines, often resulting in compromising what is good on both sides.  Lee, named after chef Susur Lee, is perhaps the best example of a fusion experiment gone right.

The setting at Lee is grand, with lofty ceilings and contemporary furnishings.  The wait staff is knowledgeable and service-oriented.  The drinks menu is extensive.  And the food, chosen correctly, is spectacular.  Get Susur's Signature Singaporean-style Slaw for the table--it is multi-flavored, reportedly with 19 ingredients.  The lentil and quinoa croquettes come with mustard fruit and rosemary pesto yogurt.  And the Goat Cheese Tart, my favorite, incorporates zucchini, eggplant and jalapeño and tomato.  The dessert menu is interesting--I will be trying the French & Chinese Tong Yuen and the Warm Molten Chocolate Cake on my next visit.

Lee is certainly one of the Top 3 restaurants I have tried in Toronto.  I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a great atmosphere.  Service is exceptional but you pay for it.  Try the oyster caesar with the slaw appetizer to start things off right.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience and great food. There was a huge time lapse between food coming out but our server was great and very knowledgeable about all the dishes so I can look past that.

Our group tried the following:
Singaporean style slaw with charred tuna - fantastic 

Cheeseburger spring rolls - great

Lamb chops with banana fritters - great

Black Cod - good 

Wish we would've had room for dessert because their dessert offerings looked amazing!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and whenever I am in town I'll come by for the slaw. But the service was lacking during a past visit. There was a ton of sediment in my wine glass that I noticed, no bueno. When asked if the bottle was just dumped into the glass the server said there was \"no harm and no foul\". I get it, but really? Just bring another glass. Then someone found a hair in the quinoa... Pretty gross. Didn't want to make a big stink about it while eating so I just mentioned it quietly to the server as our bill came. Like the wine, nothing was done. Next time I'll know better."}
{"text":"Not bad for a spontaneous night out with no reservations - we ended up sitting at the bar in the back, it was fine.
the place was unexpectedly casual, and maybe if we sat at a table i would've  expected a lot more from the experience and the service level that we received.

The braised beef dish was by far the best thing we had that night, which was 1 of 6 things we ordered. (not such a good ratio for a susur rest. and how can anything slow cooked not be good at a place like this? -- )
the rest were strangely surprising flavour components that were intriguing, but never made me say \"yummy\".
it was merely ok --

the coconut soup --
interesting, i liked it, but more sour than expected.  the rough not rough med diced tomatoes, sweet corn, cilantro, shrimp, and occasional roasted garlic slice needed to be eaten all in the same spoon full to mix all of the flavours together, otherwise the lemongrassy sourness of the soup overpowers it all. (i love lemongrass, but the tartness of the soup confuses your idea of a \"coconut soup\")

the mexican goat cheese tart -- the goat cheese overpowered everything else on the tart, and the beautifully done puff pastry 
circle on the bottom that should have been the highlight, became just a supporting character to the cheese. i believe there was a kind of pesto of some sort, some other cheese, and grilled veg, olives, on there too, but i couldn't even taste any of it. we scraped out some of the cheese to eat the rest of the tart.

the fried sable dish -
beautifully executed fish - but confused with the granola like rolled oats on top, microgreens that look like fish bones when cut into the dish, and strange \"tostidos\" tasting tomato sauce. it was an amazing protein muddled with strange flavours that instead of enhancing the sable, hid the flavours. it was wierd to bite into the flaky fried fish, and expect the crunch to come from the batter, but be left chewing on oats for longer than you expect. i was befuddled.

the orzo crab dish -
interesting presentation, looked like a big ball of rice covered 
with a tortilla in the dim lighting, when some waiter threw it down on the table without explaining it. haha, we were confused as to whether or not we ordered that dish -- 
the crab salad inside the soft egg like \"shell\" was very reminiscent of the fresh hot wok \"chi\" you get at a good chinese rest when you order top end fried rice. impressive and interesting.

and finally dessert --
we ordered the sorbet -- 
impressive presentation with the GIANT tuille, really pretty until you bite into it and it tastes like a flavourless shreaded wheatie.
there were chocolate sprinkles at the bottom of the dish which was a bit confusing, but nice to almost have a familiar flavour on the plate.
the four scoops were four diff flavours, so it was fun to play guess what that is which was revealed later by our not so attentive waitress  -  guava, strawberry-banana, vanilla (that was not so vanilla and more nutty), and mango jackfruit.
there's always that one dish that i would've been happy just ordering and eating in the end when i reflect on my meal - and that's was the braised beef. i would go just for that dish.

we ordered 5 things and a dessert, 2 beers for ~ $130/2 ppl.

so seems like the theme of this place is surprise - maybe that's what food means to the chef's in the back at Lee's.
it was an interesting experience, with interesting food. 
would i return? probably not.
i was hyper critical of this place - but it's SUSUR LEE, i had to see what all the fuss was about."}
{"text":"My mom and I were really excited to try Lee after all the hype we heard. We ordered the famous Singapore Slaw and were really excited to try it. Two mouthfuls and my mom noticed a long strand of hair in her plate (she has short hair!). We immediately called the server and told him about it and his immediate reaction was \"we have no one with long hair in the kitchen\". No apology, no shock - just those words. He then went back with the plate and came back looking pretty annoyed and asked us if we would like the dish again. If you were to eat salad with a piece of hair, would you order it again? No way. Beyond that, we couldn't really enjoy the rest of the food we ordered because of how gross the whole experience was. I've heard great things about this restaurant and I'm sure it's great, but not for me!"}
{"text":"Server totally overworked, no support.  Forgot our drinks, left us sitting with piles of dirty plates.  Food was interesting looking on the menu but everything tasted the same.  Very loud. Not comfortable."}
{"text":"Most dishes come in 4 pieces, but the restaurant is able to add an extra piece if you have a group of 5 for an extra cost. Salad was good, cod was way too small, chicken ball, pork ribs and Peking duck are all pretty filling. 

Seating is right and washroom is not so up to the standard ..."}
{"text":"To be honest, prior to coming to Lee I was extremely skeptical of all restaurants that were \"fusion\". Fusion to me seemed more like you couldn't master either cuisine, so just decided to put the two together and heck, maybe it'll taste alright. 

This restaurant was a testament to the fact that fusion could be mind-blowingly delicious, perfectly aesthetic and so very hip. 

Highly recommend the following: 
Lemon & Oolong Tea Edamame, I have never had Edamame so savoury in my life before. The lemon and oolong was so refreshing and complemented the texture of the peas so well. 

Susur's Signature Singaporean-style Slaw, I know everyone is raving about this slaw, but believe me, there's a reason for it. Just by the appearance itself, it certainly is the most elaborate slaw I have ever seen. Stacked up, it was around 20-30 cm in height. The server told us there were 20 ingredients inside, including tulips? Despite the smorgasbord of ingredients, the taste was simple, elegant and very fresh. 

Caramelized Black Cod, consists of Cantonese preserves, miso mustard, dim sum turnip cake. Who knew turnip cake could be served with cod? Once again, the combination does not seem intuitive at all, but the taste was perfection. 

The service was amazing. It was obvious that all the servers knew the dishes inside and out. When the server were explaining to us the Singaporean slaw, it literally felt like he was spewing gold out of his mouth. After going through the menu, I was honestly so tempted to just order EVERYTHING. 

The price is steep here, but so worth it. 
Genius, absolutely genius. Will be coming back as soon as my wallet recovers."}
{"text":"The best of Lee's restaurants in Toronto. The food is consistent and delicious, and if you happen to be there while they're serving their 25+ ingredient sangria, I would definitely recommend it. I love full dinners here, but if you're budget aware and still want to experience the best of Lee, their sangria and slaw are my go-to. 

I personally wouldn't recommend the feta and watermelon salad, I found the flavours all too overwhelming.

I would highly recommend the the slow braised beef, but I always ask that they go light on the sour cream, otherwise you end up with a huge dollop that interferes with the flavours of the puree."}
{"text":"i'll say what everyone else is saying: the slaw is fantastic, the beef is wonderful. the drinks are tasty. 

now some stuff most people don't talk about much:

the highs: the dj was really turning out some awesome old beats, quite a pleasure.

the lows: the decor feels a little too clubby and gaudy for the food, which should be the real focus in this place. second, it's way too loud. i was in a group of 3, and we had to shout and often repeat what we had just said so all could hear. 

despite that, the food really is fantastic and that's why i only dock 1 star."}
{"text":"Make a reservation as far in advance as you can and call to verify the day before you plan on dining.  The food is amazing; all the other reviews will tell you that.  If you want to sit at a table, make a reservation.  If you want to eat here (and you should) and you're not able to make a reservation, you can dine at the bar.  It's the same food and the service will be great.  If you don't mind having a full meal at the bar, go for it!  And yes, have the Singapore Slaw!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in the whole city and I was born and raised here which should say a lot. No other restaurant in Toronto or Miami will compare (sorry Frings, xx).
I've been here way too many times so here is a list of everything I suggest you try:
the slaw!!!
goat cheese tart
grilled octopus
wild king garlic shrimp
cheese burger spring rolls
jerk spicy pork ribs (put them in the bun and your life will be complete)
peking duck
caramelized black cod
diver scallop
thai satay
green curry chicken
tong yuan dessert (yes lawd)

Actually - there is an option to try a whole bunch of different things if you go with a big group. Take the option and enjoy! The sangria with a million different ingredients is so yummy but be careful if you're lightweight lol. The service is always great. Ambiance is lovely. The music is perfect. Thank you Chef Susur Lee for this magical place!

xx"}
{"text":"The service is immaculate. I don't know how servers can describe, and memorize, the meals they serve. The place is cozy enough to have dinner with a date. The service is immaculate. I've often tell people that for me, service and ambiance come first and then food second. Poor service dampens your mood. 

The tapas are great to share. It's good to come here not just with a date but people you already know. Not recommended for client meetings unless you order the greedy stuff. Among to try are crab cake, braised beef, lamb and satay. Well, don't judge the number of portion... it adds up so you get full a lot. Order about 4 dishes for a group of three people or 3 dishes for a group if there's only two you. Then order more if you're still hungry."}
{"text":"After this experience, getting closer to degrading it to a 3 star.

We wanted to go and eat their slaw but it so happened to fall on winterlicious. They still had a few ah la carte items which included the slaw so we still ended up going.

The atmosphere is pretty nice as usual, but somewhat loud. Last time we sat outside but the tables were not that usable, especially for small dishes for sharing.

The vegetarian options this time turned out to be a lot better and show cased more of Lee's fusion specialty. Ordered: Slaw and Quinoa Vegetable Chow Fan (ah la carte)

Winterlicious had the burger spring roll, jerky ribs and trio.

The ribs really should be revisited. There weren't much dynamics to the dish and flet more like comfort food. Really nothing special about the ribs. Besides the presentation being a little nicer, the quality of the meat was sub par and sauce over took the dish.

On the other hand the Quinoa Vegetable Chow Fan was a lot better than I expected. Lots of different ingredients and the puffed rice gave it a different dimension to the dish. Flavourful and worth ordering again.

Never had dessert here but if its like the one provided for winterlicious then I would probably not get any dessert. The trio was meh, it was ok I guess. So for the price and the caliber of the restaurant, I expected more.

Conclusion: Would come back for the regular menu items. And the Chow Fan if they have it."}
{"text":"This weekend we ventured out and fought the TIFF traffic for my birthday dinner at Lee.  Since our reservation (told in advance we had a maximum of two hours) was for 6:15 pm, we beat the main dinner rush and the restaurant wasn't full.  We had a choice of inside or patio.  Having never been there before, I opted for inside so I could look around.  

In the background, Susur himself was bustling around plugging in extension cords and fixing floral arrangements.  The hosts were pleasant and took us to our table.  Almost immediately, our server came over and took our drink order.  While waiting for our drinks, three separate staff members came over and repeated the same script: \"Have you dined with us before?  This is a sharing style restaurant\" and so on.  Inefficient?  Yes, but forgivable.

We ordered the potato chips and hamburger spring rolls for appetizers.  I wasn't a huge fan of the filling in the spring roll, but I could appreciate the variety of textures.  For mains, the infamous slaw, the tuna feature dish, and the green curry despite the servers insistence that the beef dishes are superior.  I enjoyed all of them, especially the slaw and the green curry (YUM!).  The only issue was the pacing at which the dishes were served.  There was an uncomfortably long gap after the initial rush of the first few.  I was actually speculating if they 'd forgotten the rest of our order when our server came over and said she had told them to hold off, so we could have a break.  I suppose, in retrospect, I can appreciate her consideration because we left the restaurant pleasantly full with two carry-out containers.

Overall, I enjoyed Lee and would definitely consider returning for another special occasion meal."}
{"text":"came here on a friday night-was seated after a short 5 min wait. the restaurant was pretty busy so i was surprised they took us that quick.

the atmosphere is very cool, lots of mood  lighting but they were playing..2 chainz? fetty wap? interesting combo! servers were super super attentive and nice. 

the food-it is definitely pricey. the waiter told us for a table of three to order about 3-6 plates. we went with slaw with sashimi, beef/chicken/shrimp skewers and chicken balls (forgot the actual name). each dish had alot of flavour-nothing was bland at all. they have alot of sauces and little details on each dish that made a big difference.

by the end we were actually pretty full- the chicken pieces were quite large kept me satisfied all night even through a whole night of wine drinking! 

due to the prices i dont think il really be back any time soon but it would be a nice place to split dishes with your date."}
{"text":"I love the hip vibe of this restaurant.  Love the cool decor, the exposed brick...all of it.    The only drawback is the closeness of our fellow diners.  We were seated so close to another couple that we were practically dining with them.  They couldn't help but overhear most of our conversation and we ended up chatting with them so it wasn't an awful experience but it should be noted if you are looking for an intimate and romantic place.  You may want to ask for a more secluded table.  

The Singapore Slaw was good.  Presentation was impressive and the flavours worked well together, although I found it to be on the sweet side for my taste.  We ordered it with the tuna shashimi.  It was tasty but I wouldn't characterize it as outstanding.  The outside sear probably didn't have enough flavour for me (hint: not enough salt) but it was very tender.  

I had the seasonal mimosa and it was outstanding.  Pricey but very good.  

For a \"sharing plates\" restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised by the generous portions.  Typically the portions are on the skimpy side - not so at Lee Lounge.  

The Caramelized Black Cod was outstanding as was the slow braised beef.  I think we went overboard by ordering the Peking & Char Sui Duck.  We were starving when we got there but we didn't expect the larger portions so by the time it showed up, I was pretty full.  Nevertheless, I somehow managed to force down two steamed pancakes filled with all of the yummy garnishes and the amazing foie gras pâté.  

Dessert was out of the question since we were stuffed but since I plan on coming back, I will be sure to leave room for dessert the next time."}
{"text":"our new favorite.   food and service are always excellent.  carmelized black cod is the best.  unbelievable Singapore slaw... The number of ingredients they have is unbelievable.  I am chinese but I never like any fusion dish or resturant but Lee is my favorite."}
{"text":"This evening was a special celebration for my wife and i and it was truly splendid . A fine dinner. The Bloody Caesar with an oyster was fantastic. The dinner just went up after that. Great service all around."}
{"text":"Just returned from my second visit to Lee. Let's review while it's fresh in my mind.

I just *LOVE* this place. The food is so delish. Dishes are creative and presentation is fab. The atmosphere is dark, modern and cool. Server was friendly, helpful and efficient. Would be a great venue for a romantic date!

We dined as a party of 11 this time and the waiter suggested we just order \"Chef's Special\" - the chef picks the dishes rather than each person ordering. We had 1 vegetarian in our group so we got to try at least half of the menu.

The dishes are all large-sized tapas and each dish is generally big enough for 3-4 people to have a taste. They recommend 2-3 dishes per person when ordering.

We tried:

Susur style diced veggie chow-mein - this comes with big lettuce leaves and you spoon the chow-mein on and create a wrap. Very good.

Chickpea sweet onion fritter - served with a mint sauce. Pretty tasty but couldn't really identify chickpeas in it. Just looked mostly like the battered onion slices you get with fancy burgers. Tasted nice but wouldn't recommend it if you are only ordering a few items.

Spicy crisp tofu - came with 5 pieces. I'm not a vegetarian but this was pretty awesome.

Pineapple avocado salad - Again, very tasty but not my favourite.

Singapore slaw - This one is a signature dish. Order it! It's so tasty. As mentioned below, it has something like 14 different ingredients.

Then we had a slew of fish and meat dishes which were ALL so amazing - I would recommend any of the following - Caramelized black cod, garlic shrimp, slow braised beef, sauteed jerk chicken and rack of lamb.

If I went back, my top 3 would be the rack of lamb, singapore slaw and garlic shrimp.

They have a nice dessert menu and cocktail selection. I tried a mango mojito - the ice cubes were hollowed and had bits of mango inserted and it was topped off with fresh mint. Really nice.

I want to go back...soon"}
{"text":"So yummy! I came here during Summerlicious (even though we didn't order off that menu) 
My new favourite thing is Singaporean-style slaw...OMG AMAZING! My gf told me about it and she's like we're def going to need 2 orders, I thought she was crazy BUT it was definitely NEEDED! Soooo good! You can't come here w/o ordering this dish!
I had the watermelon salad (Feta, charred jalapeno, fresh mint, celery, soy & balsamic vinaigrette) - small but tasty. I wanted to order the Beet, artichoke & heirloom tomato salad but it was taken off the menu for Summerlicious. 
My gfs split cheese burger spring rolls, slow braised beef, and an order of the veg noodles. They said it was all really good, except the slow braised beef wasn't really their thing.
Definitely a 5 star restaurant, lost one star because they didn't serve the full menu during Summerlicious and had only a limited one :(
Can't wait to go again when they are serving the full menu!"}
{"text":"Do not come here. Service was decent but food is nothing special for the price. My friend and I came for winterlicious and ordered 1 dish each of the appetizers and the braised beef. The beef was way too soft (almost soggy) and the potatoes that were served with it were cold. 
The next day both her and I got uncomfortable feelings in our stomachs, which I really don't think would have happened besides going to Lee. This weird stomachache lasted a week -- we're not sure which dish led to this, but there must've been something wrong. 

Really disappointed with the food from what was supposed to come from a really famous chef. 
do not come here. I would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"I visited Lee for my dads birthday and overall I must say that this place was a little bit too hyped up. Do not get me wrong, the service, atmosphere, and detailing of everything, including the presentation of the food, the waiters knowledge and overall setting was impeccable, but the overall taste of the food was, can I say, nothing special. It was a total of 4 of us and we decided to get several dishes so we could all share. We ordered the braised beef tacos, which were not that great (cannot even compare to la carnita), the slaw, which I must say was really beautifully presented but again taste wise was nothing special. We also ordered the fried tofu which was the most delicious and by far my favourite dish and lastly, the pecking duck. The pecking duck was really yummy but for the price and portion size it was not really worth it. We also ended off our meal with a banana chocolate cake with ice cream and raspberry compote which was the worst dessert I have ever had (and I love sweets!). It tasted fake and as if it had just been prepared from a box out of the freezer. Overall, I enjoyed the evening very much but if you're planning on going somewhere solely for great food I would suggest you go elsewhere. But again, there may have been some things on the menu that are delicious that we never ordered!"}
{"text":"Let me first explain, the food is good, I put a 2 star mainly based on our experience there because I did not like how we were treated. 

We went there for a bachelorette party, which began with a nice introduction from our waiter, Seth. However, after we ordered our Entrees, the maid of honour was informed by Seth that the minimum spend for our large party is $45. Yes, we were told that when we made the booking, however were reminded about it after every order we made. After our entrees he told us we weren't at $45 pp yet and needed to order more. Which I don't think is very professional considering we haven't even gotten our meals yet. After we all ordered dessert we were at about $39 pp and was reminded AGAIN that we still didn't have enough. We ordered a pitcher of Sangria and after Seth miscounted how many cups to bring us (because obviously you divide the pitcher evenly) he brought us another class of Sangria to make up for the miscount but proceeded to CHARGE us for the extra glass and didn't tell us about it. After we got our bill and the automatic 18% tip was charged we didn't hear from Seth again...go figure after he got his nice 18% tip on our $600 bill that he reminded us about during every course. 

However, we did have an AMAZING bus boy named Brandon, who was delight. We wished we had him all night because he was charming and hilarious. 

In my opinion, if you have a large party, don't go to Lee, since they FORCE you to spend $45 pp and reminded us that \"we had to turn way tables because of your party\". 

Who wants to feel like that when celebrating a nice night?"}
{"text":"CONS: Not an easy place to spot if you are not familiar with the area. My party walked by it twice and had to ask people on the street where the restaurant was. 

The food was very tasty however, it took about 20 minutes or more for each dish to come to the table.  We were only able to enjoy the family style plates one at a time which was disappointing since I'm used to Asian family style restaurants that bring the dishes out nearly the same time. I guess that's the way it is at Lee. So if you are into that type of lengthy dining, this is the spot for you to try. 

We had to request to be moved to another table after requesting to have the central air turned down or off because cold air was blasting on my wife and her friend. They had to sit with their sweaters and jacket on. It's one thing to be hungry and wait 20 minutes between each dish. But it's a whole NUH-THA LEV-OL when you are cold and hungry.  The staff was very accommodating though, and sat us at a table near the bar in the back. 

PROS:  The food was delicious. We had started with the croquettes, then the cod, then the Vietnamese beef, then the jerk ribs, and for desert the molten chocolate and creme brûlée. 

Croquettes were very good. The Chinese mustard added some light heat to your pallet. 

The cod was tasty, the sauce really made the dish. 

The beef was a refreshing dish but had a lot going on with the flavors. 

The jerk ribs were bomb. Two different sauces. One had some real heat, the other no heat at all. The meat fell right off the bone and was so tender. I would definitely recommend this dish. 

I had the creme brûlée and it tasted like any other you've probably had. 

TIP:  Be prepared to wait for your food. Our dining experience lasted over 2 hours. Make sure you have lots to talk about with your party or significant other. If not you can knock back some drinks but they are pretty expensive. I had the $16 sangria special and it didn't offer me a buzz. Also, you may want to consider bringing a pillow to sit on. The wood chairs are not comfortable after 2 hours of sitting. I got up and felt a slight numbness in my legs when we were ready to leave."}
{"text":"Lee is a restaurant that does Asian Fusion exactly the way it should be done. The food is both delicious and creative, and the atmosphere is upbeat. The perfect place to come with a group, or to just have a delicious meal in an awesome setting.

Upon sitting, a waitress goes table to table with a cart containing their signature drink. This pretty much starts the mood off. From there I started with an order of their special Vietnamese slaw, which is absolutely unreal. I've never had cole slaw remotely as delicious as this. It was definitely the highlight of the meal and one the most delicious things I've ever tasted.

From there I got orders of the cheeseburger spring rolls, lobster ravioli and green curry chicken. All of the dishes were very good and unique in their own way. The spring rolls had a little spice to them, the lobster ravioli were juicy and the green curry had a little sweetness.

Props to this place for the creativity of the dishes. Everything was unique, but delicious. There's also a good sized bar section and fairly decent liquor selection. Awesome spot all around."}
{"text":"I took my wife to Lee for her birthday. Now don't get me wrong, we went to Lee expecting some of the best Asian food we have ever had. The food was fresh and authentic. However the quality was sub - par.

We started out meal with edamame. A vegetable similar to a snap pea. It is hearty and commonly boiled and dusted with salt. In this cases the edamame were marinated with with mustard seed and garlic. It was finished with soy nuts. Overall the taste was excellent, the mustard seed was an avid compliment that played well off of the earthy taste of the edamame. The soy nuts added a much needed crunch. However the one issue was that they were very over done!

The Asian slaw we followed with was unbelievable. A whopping 19 ingredients comprised a fresh, sweet, acidic slaw. The pickled vegetables brought a tantalizing sweetness to the please. Fried rice noodles balanced out texture. Best twenty dollars ever spent.

Unfortunately, this is where the meal lost some steam. We ordered the crab cakes and for 25 dollars I expected three of four. Nope, only one. Albeit, it was the best crab cake I have ever had, but if it were any other restaurant I would never have ordered it. Paired with a tamarind sauce that was way too sweet to keep down as well as jicama rolls too sour to be edible, it was not very pleasant.

They offered specials when we arrived. One was Asian, pulled beef tacos with an avocado puree. Again, a very small portion. However the avocado puree was an outstanding addition. It was velvety smooth, expertly seasoned and not overly convuleted with other flavors. Yet again, a dish fell short. The pulled beefs was, mushy? The texture was confusing. I would expect a similar texture to pulled pork. But it disappointed, as well it was too bitter.

The meal was 80 dollars without tip. A good dinning experience and the first of the top chef eataries we will visit. I would probably not go back, the value is not there for a small plate restaurant. A fact that they should advertise. 

If you want to go to Lee, be sure you're not too hungry!"}
{"text":"AMAZING, DELICIOUS. There were 5 of us and we went all out.  It was my first time in Toronto and this was the only place I wanted to go to. Amazing! 5 of us $450. Make a reso. Cocktails are expensive. Entrees are $20-28 each and fairly small portioned but delicious and worth the price. 

- Singaporean style slaw with 17 ingredients. Texture and flavor combo is to die for, 
- Caramelized miso black cod on a turnip cake. I always love black cod! 
- Garlic tiger shrimp with potato pea croquette - my favorite!
- Top Chef Green Curry Chicken - delicious!!!!
- Duck wraps - duck was kind of chewy but flavorful. 
- Bison filet x2 orders - tender, delicious

Leave room for desserts!
- Banana chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream
- Peanut butter chocolate mousse cake with blackberries and sauce
- molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream
- berry and apple crumble cake with vanilla ice cream

AND I got a picture with Susur Lee, which I could have just died. He's wonderful, kind, and the best chef ever!"}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious dinner. Dim lighting, lots of two-person tables, not too loud.. Strikes me as a good place for a date.

I ordered the shrimp &  cod cake, golden sand roasted chicken and dessert trio. I thought the food was pretty tasty but wasn't very filling.

Our server was pretty good, very attentive and described all our food in detail."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth the visit.
The food is tapas style and the waiter suggested 3-4 items to order for a party of two.
We ordered the garlic shrimp...Jerk pork ribs...Singaporean slaw (their signature dish)..steak. ...braised beef...& dessert.
The one dish we weren't crazy about was probably the braised beef. They do give good amount of beef but it was lacking in flavor. Also, the dessert is just okay. We were actually expecting more creativity from a world class chef."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious today. Overall was a great experience, good food, service, atmosphere. Really had no complaints except we found a small piece of plastic in one of the plates, but the were quite apologetic and gave us a dessert on the house. Either way we really enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour/dinner with a friend, and a hearty appetite. This review is actually going to be mildly unhelpful because we ordered 2 out of the 3 dishes off the waiter's recommendations, and therefore cannot tell you precisely what it was called (Sorry!!!)

First, we had the famous Singaporean Slaw. Fantastic! Came in a generous size, and the server rattled off all 19 ingredients. I'll admit I cannot remember even 10 of the ingredients...grated carrot? Whatever it was, great flavours, interesting crunchy texture. 

Then we had a strange lull in the meal. We finished our cocktails ($10 each during happy hour!) and kinda twiddled our thumbs a bit. Luckily, my friend and I have lots to talk about. Then our second plate came, which was two seafood cakes, and scallops. This was one of the specials. Delish!

Dessert was the special, which had vanilla bean ice cream, some sort of chocolate cake. 

Summary being, food was beautifully presented, very unique flavours. Service was excellent! Definitely a pricey dinner but worth at try"}
{"text":"Oooh, I'm in love. My husband and I went to celebrate a special occasion. We didn't like the alleyway table we were shown to, so then they took us through the kitchen to a separate room which was awesome! Excellent ambience here, top notch service and the food was amazing. We shared the special starter of the day (tacos). I ordered the pork ribs and was blown by the spicy sweet ginger flavour. My husband's thai dish was good, but I can't say it was mind blowing. We had the creme brulee and it was good. Paid $100 each - expensive but worth it for a special celebration. I'll be back. They know how to get unique flavours with a kick at this place."}
{"text":"Had a great experience overall. The service was great and food was delicious. There is a lot of ingredients and flavors in their dishes which makes this spot unique and cool!!"}
{"text":"Fun and mouth watering food!  One of my favorites!  Some dishes have over 30 ingredients and the portion amounts are fair.  Pricey but worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I personally wasn't a huge fan of the dishes I tried at Lee's... especially for the price.

To start we tried the well known Singapore slaw. Too gingery for my liking. I think adding one of the meat add-ons may have made it better since I'm not really a veggies person. I felt like I was eating nature lol. 

The shrimp dish was by far the favourite of the slaw, ravioli and desert we tried. I'll prob come back because my boyfriend did enjoy this very much. 

I'd suggest going with the tasting menu for first timers so that there is no doubt if the food isn't your thing after trying everything first."}
{"text":"Came here for Happy hour a few days ago. They're doing half price appetizers from 5:30-7:30 and $10 cocktails. We tried the liver and foie gras pate with a mango chutney and crostinis, as well as a tuna tartar app, soooo good!! We sat at the bar and the service was top notch, and the atmosphere was great. Susur Lee, keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I came for the Summerlicious menu, but my favourite item was actually the Signature Singaporean Style Slaw, which is a salad with 19 ingredients that they toss in front of you at your table. I'm usually not a salad person, but this slaw was really flavourful and crunchy, with a refreshing mixture of different vegetables and a light peanut and roasted sesame dressing. I would come back just for this dish. 

The Summerlicious dishes were not as impressive, although I did really enjoy the Cod & Octopus Taco, which was crunchy and fresh, with the mango and papaya nicely complementing the seafood. The Cheese Burger Spring Roll was not as special, with an overwhelming cheese taste that made it seem a little heavy.  The Roasted Grouper was flavourful but light, paired nicely with squash and plantains. 

The dessert trio contained items that are not on the regular menu. The only one worth mentioning was the passionfruit ice cream with basil seeds, which was the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. 

The highlight for me was actually their sangria, which contains 27 ingredients with a base of lychee rose and prosecco. They actually push around a sangria cart and make it right in front of you. It was the most tasty (and pretty) sangria I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This is an upscale Asian restaurant. The ambiance is nice with outdoor seating, nice drinks (Sangria) and good service. You are expected to share the plates so the menu prices can seem hefty for one person, but not with the larger servings. Good was food but didn't wow me. The shrimp dish was really good. The chicken dish, noted as Top Chef, had more of an Indian food/curry flavor than expected. Wasn't too enjoyable for us but might be your style."}
{"text":"Impressive taco and spring rolls!! The spring rolls are so juicy!!! The dessert and main course were fine. Will go there again for the starters!!"}
{"text":"There are restaurants and then there's Lee's restaurant. I'll make it simple. The waiter at the time seemed cocky over confident. After the slaw(mandatory order) for appetizer, I decided to give the waiter a break and realized that his confidence was warranted. 

Because we was a large group of 8, we decide not to order individual meals but go Tapas style and let the waiter bring out random dishes to enjoy. We were not disappointed. Every selection was right on point. The blacken Cod was the best fish dish I've ever had. The curry chicken received a 19.5 out of 20 and I'm wondering who deducted the .5 from the 20 and what was that person smoking. The steak was the best steak. 

And we finished the night with a random dish of dessert. The chocolate lava cake was by far the best and I wish we ordered more of that. 

This 4 pitchers of Sangria seemed to be amazing. I say seemed because I don't drink alcohol. But my friends punished it. 

This was by far the best restaurant I've been too. I enjoyed every second of it and now this will require me to make another trip to Toronto. Myers just for this place. BRAVO"}
{"text":"Winterlicous 2012 Dinner ($35) at Lee was quite delightful.

No Susur is NOT in the house but I am here to taste the food, not to see him.

Making a reservation even on a Monday is wise because this place does get busy and filled up. Don't expect a quiet romantic atmosphere here.... the noise level can be quite high at time, but at least the lighting is dim and dark enough!

The services was a little slow to start with, then my waiter realized I was not waiting for anyone... I am ready to order, ready to eat and ready to go to the Yelp event.

Lee's pot stickers with salted chilies
- they looks hard of hard but when I bite into one, it was surprising soft and the wrapping just have the right texture and thickness
- The chillies just gave the sauce a little kick... a little salty, a little sour and a little spicy

Slow braised beef with sour cream, potato leek purée & crispy shallots 
- This definitely taste beef brisket I used to but with a more intense flavour
- The gravy from the beef is thick and heavy
- hearty and comfort food

Chocolate Banana Cake
- Warm Chocolate cake?! that's all I need to know!!
- As always the dessert is really the best part of the menu....

I really appreciate how the server always explain the ingredients in every single dish that serves... so I don't need to guess what exactly I am eating in the dark.

I need to come back and try out the Singaporian-style slaw (btw Gourmet Malaysia does serves that but usually over the Chinese New Year) and their Top Chef Green Curry Chicken."}
{"text":"Susur Lee closed his NYC location so I made sure to put this on my list while I was in town. The Singapore slaw is a must! Crazy how there's so many ingredients but everything works. We also had the green curry chicken and the cod. For dessert the chocolate PB bar. Everything was great and service was wonderful. Get the raspberry mojito."}
{"text":"Had the slaw (very asian flavors), the green chicken curry (tender and juicy. I was a big fan of this dish) and the slow braised beef (probably the softest most melt in your mouth beef I've ever had but needs a little more seasoning). The flavors of the slaw and chicken curry hits your palate right away. The beef was the complete opposite. As soft as the meat was, it was bordering on bland. The servers were nice and knew their stuff. They had a really good system going. Would love to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"The service was great. I really didn't like the wine they brought me and the waiter went back and asked the chef what he would recommend based on the reason why I didn't like the wine. The food with timely and delicious.  We followed the waiter's suggestion of the slaw + 2 dishes and I'm so glad we did because we were full by the end of 3 dishes. Every dish is very unique here. We got the slaw, poached lobster and shrimp ravioli, and cheeseburger spring rolls. I can't wait to come here again and try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Really good service and recommend this place all-around.  Tried the tuna tartare special and was underwhelmed but the house special slaw was really delicious and even better paired with the crispy potatoes with spices.  Lamb chops..really tasty"}
{"text":"I hope I don't get crucified for rating Susur Lee's restaurant a 3. I had very high expectations and Lee Restaurant is GOOD. To me, I didn't feel it was worth the price paid. I honestly can't say much more. We had the singapore slaw, which again was good. Did not blow me away. It doesn't really impress me that the wait staff has to know every single ingredient in the slaw; I'd prefer to eat something more delicious and have my waiter oblivious to what's in it. Maybe that's just me. The other dishes had the same effect on me. Good, but nothing stood out. Would I return? Maybe, if someone else pays. Atmosphere is lovely, and the staff definitely works hard and has a great system. What it boils down to is taste in food I guess."}
{"text":"Susur, what happened?!!!
I was very excited and had high hopes for Lee Lounge but was incredibly disappointed.

I was there Saturday evening for dinner. Lee Lounge doesn't take reservations so when we arrived there I mentioned that we were there for dinner and was seated at Lee Restaurant instead. I didn't see the \"Pedestal of Susur's favorite plates\" on the menu (which was one of the reasons I was there for), so when I asked the server he said that it is only served in the lounge area and asked if I wanted to be moved to the lounge area, which we did.

The menu was trying to hard, it seems. It was an interesting of fusion of traditional dim sum dishes and bar food appetizers. Susur is known for his Asian fusions but this was not executed very well and the food just fell flat. You could go to one of the better Chinese restaurants in Markham and have much better modern dim sum dishes, and at a fraction of the price. 

First plate:
\"The Pedestal\" - this is a sample collection of \"Susur's favorite dishes\" nicely presented on a 2-tiered dessert pedestal. 
It consisted of: 
\"Hunan chicken wings\" - Cooked in a sauce similarly used to simmer chicken feet dim sum. Nicely done, but really nothing special.
\"Whipped chickpea dip\" - Basically hummus served with potato chips. Decent hummus but I had much better.
\"Cheeseburger spring rolls\" - the stuffing of wet mushy ground beef and some indistinguishable sauce reminds me of bad frozen appetizers or banquet food. If Gerber made cheeseburger baby food, this would be it.
\"Salmon Ceviche\" - I wouldn't call this ceviche, it was simply cubes of salmon sashimi sitting in a sweet and tangy citrus soy sauce. A nice sashimi bite, but definitely not ceviche.
\"Peking Duck rolls with fois gras mousse\" - couldn't taste the fois gras and the Peking duck was a little tough and over cooked and didn't have the succulent piece of crispy skin that a Peking duck is known for. It too was over-sauced inside which made for messy eating.
\"Edamame steamed in lotus leaf and mustard salt\" - tasted just like regular edamame.

Second plate:
\"Assam Shrimp\" - Plump shrimp in a tangy-smokey-spicy sauce, very nice flavors and one of the better plates on the menu. The small cube of dried pineapple on top was the perfect touch.

Third plate:
\"Dim sum shrimp\" - This is basically a Chinese doughnut fritter with minced shrimp piped inside of it and cut into bite sized pieces. The shrimp was very bland and the texture was not very appealing. The fried greasy flavor was dominating.  It was nicely presented in a bamboo steamer, but there was way too much of it. More sweet soy sauce was served with it, which at this point I was sick of it.

The service was excellent. The staff was very nice and accomodating. The restaurant itself is nicely designed, cosy and very comfortable (with a great and random collection of Asian collectables and artifacts), though the music was very loud. Later on in the evening they had problems with their music as the songs were played repeatedly with long breaks of silence in between.

As the night progressed there were a hoarde of douchey guys that took over a part of the lounge which was really annoying. I am aware that this is in the club area and unfortunately attracts a lot of unsophisticated/immature types, especially on the weekends, but it was a real turnoff seeing part of the restaurant taken over by a bunch of Jersey Shore DB types that lack any class or manners.
We quickly got the check and left, as the scene got irratating and we had enough greasy dim sum bar food and went for dessert elsewhere.

In hindsight we should have stayed in the restaurant and enjoyed Susur's more solid dishes (I really wanted his signature Singapore slaw) instead of paying $100 for a couple glasses of wine and a few appetizers in the lounge.

Lee Lounge is not a great place to eat -- head straight to Lee Restaurant instead."}
{"text":"We got the slaw, jerk ribs, green curry chicken, and the tofu.

The service was cold but very professional and prompt. Like other Yelpers have mentioned, they do seem to push dishes on you too much.. our server suggested 7-9 dishes for our party of 4. We are not large people. Unlike a few other Yelpers though I did appreciate the explanation of what was in each dish we got and I was impressed the girl could name the 19 or so ingredients in the slaw.

Now the food.. the slaw was awesome as expected. I liked the jerk ribs though some parts of it may have been dry. Also the green curry chicken was good though a bit lacking in sauce. I was disappointed in the tofu dish though. A bit overpriced for what it was.

Overall a good place for a fancy dinner."}
{"text":"Had heard a lot about the chef so came here for summerlicious. Everything was amazing. The restaurant is pretty small, so I wouldn't come here with a group. I had the cheeseburger appetizer, which is amazing. my friend had the cucumber salad which came with a really nice dressing. For the entree I got chicken-I can't rememer exactly what it was called, it might be the Thai chicken. It was delicious. The service wasn't that great, and we felt a little rushed, but the food made up for it. Everything was well plated, and the server went into detail about each course. Would definetly return."}
{"text":"Went for winterlicious. Food overall was good. Not sure I understand the hype. Nothing really stood out for us flavour wise and one dish came out cold. Overall a good experience and would recommend for anyone looking for a fun night."}
{"text":"Divine. Had lunch and dinner here on the same day.  Our waiter and the food itself brought us back.  We held back on our lunch order to be all the more surprised by the dinner menu.

At lunch we ordered the two color gazpacho (red and yellow tomato), the spicy crisp tofu, the hamburger (recently rated #1 in Toronto as claimed by a sidewalk chalk sign and our waiter).  We also enjoyed Toronto's Steam Whistle pilsner along with our meal.  The acclaimed hamburger was good, but the black cod burger was the most unique dish... note the fish is not ground, so it's more of a black cod sandwich.  The flavor of the curried tempura cabbage is more noticeable on this sandwich than on the hamburger.  If you are deciding between the too and you enjoy fish opt for the black cod.  The spicy crisp tofu was delicious.  We assumed they made the tofu in the kitchen it was of such great texture and flavor, but they puchase the tofu itself.  The spice rub and sauce will transport you.

We were encouraged a dozen times by the wait staff to order Lee's signature disk the Singaporean Slaw.  You will be amused by how many Singaporean Slaws you see exiting the kitchen.  At one time I looked up and there were three waiters on the floor carrying  these towering salds to diners.  The Singaporean Slaw has numerous ingredients (19?) and is tossed at your table.  Even though everyone else is ordering it you should too!

We also tried the Prince Edward Island Mussels, the Slow braised beef with sour cream and potato leek purée, and finally the green curried chicken that won Susur Lee the highest rating ever on Top Chef Masters.   
& crispy shallots

I'm confused by the Yelpers giving low ratings to Susur Lee and Lee Restaurant. The comparison one Yelper makes between Lee and a chinese restaurant is a gross misrepesentation of the food."}
{"text":"This is my third time coming to Lee.  The first two times it was for  the Slaw. The third time my friend and I  came for  a  Summerlicious Dinner.   I convinced my friend  to order the slaw as well which we split with each other .  I had great expectations coming  in and they were exceeded of course.
Service was 100%  as usual. If you have dined here before you will understand 
 For  my picks I got my alternate choices since the  Beijing tart & the beggars purse had cheese  in them which could not be removed .  My alternates were still excellent and I got the Taco to start, the Grouper as the main, and as anyone who  has dined at a Lee restaurant will know, the dessert is a trio of three amazing desserts. 
Lets get the bad out of the way : The lighting needs to be brightened so that us foodies can take pictures of our food easily . 

Now for the food:
Slaw: Covered in my previous reviews and by many other yelpers . Two words : \" ORDER IT \"
The  Taco  was a pair of tacos that were very good.  Not too salty and not too sweet. I also took some of  my slaw and added it into the taco and it just blew my mind . 
My friends Beijing Goat Cheese Tart was good in his opinion and very filling . 
We both got the grouper  main and eating it was a joy.  Three decent sized fish pieces stacked atop each other with a butter taragon sauce. There was a rhubarb paste which we were told  to have with every bite of our dish. 
The dessert trio was a marvel. We loved the passion fruit icecream which I think was the best of the trio. The next best dessert was the chocolate pudding w rasberry  lemongrass coulis .  Savour every minute of your meal :) 
I also ordered their famous Sangria which has a lot of ingredients like the Slaw. Id liken it to the beverage version of the slaw and is also a must try. 
I will be back for the Slaw , Tong Yuen, , other dishes, and hopefully more liciouses"}
{"text":"Sucer Lee's well known lower end restaurant, Lee, was a less than stellar experience. While supposed to be on the lower price scale for dinner we ended up spending a lot because we got almost everything on the menu. Firstly, the atmosphere is meh. Our table was beside the elevated bar which is located at the back. Tight quarters and an overtly red ambiance made the meal uncomfortable. 

Don't bother ordering the shoe sting fries with chili aoli they are hugely over rated. We didn't order one of the featured main dishes, the pork, and when we saw it go by we felt it might have been the one thing to save our meal but it was already too late. The soups were gross too. 

I consider my palate to be quite experienced and this meal was difficult to get through! The only good moment was dessert. The chocolate banana dessert was delicious but not worth having to eat the whole meal. Next time I go back, which is probably never, I will skip the crap and go right for dessert."}
{"text":"Not so great:
Singapore Slaw
Peking Duck
Cod

It took 15 minutes for the hostess to acknowledge we were even there waiting for our reservation and another 10 to have us seated. From there the nightmare began. It took forever for them to take our orders and for our food to arrive. Even when the server noticed our food was taking quite so time, he didn't come over to acknowledge it. 

The food was mediocre. Everything had too much sauce over everything that I could barely taste the ingredients itself. I don't love or hate the food but my main gripes about this place was the service. We were in the restaurant for a good 2 hours. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This time, we came back to LEE to have dessert. Just like always, it's busy on a weeknight! 

We had the warm molten lava cake and the signature French and Chinese tong Yuen. Molten lava was very warn inside and it wasn't sweet that sweet which was nice. For the tong yuen, it was very unique. I usually have tong Yuen in the very classic way - tong Yuen with ginger sweet soup. So I really admired Susur Lees creativity with the Chinese dishes. I thought the tong yuens taste really good! 

We enjoyed our dessert here and we got to meet Chef Susur Lee in person! I hope I can bump into him again to have a picture!! Yesss!"}
{"text":"This is my all-time favourite place to eat. Every single time I go here the food is excellent. The servers are friendly and attentive. My favourite thing on the menu is the cheese burger spring rolls, along with everything else on the menu. I Highly recommend trying Lee restaurant."}
{"text":"I'd rate it higher if it was cheaper. 

It' hard to live up to the hype this place generates. It really seems they're living on the aftermath of Top Chef press. Our meal was overly sweet and salty, including the famous slaw. Yes, I understand the essential mix of sweet, sour, salty & spicy but this balance was off and swung too far in the sweet direction. So far that it ruined the other delicate flavors. Roughly $10 overpriced in my estimation. Money is better spent elsewhere, IMO."}
{"text":"Susur's signature Singaporean style slaw was amazing.. The best salad I've ever had. The cheese burger spring rolls were also delicious! The tacos were okay. Would recommend Lee any time. Would love to try Bent and Luckee soon."}
{"text":"The best ever.

Maybe the best Asian fusion meal I've ever had, and certainly one of the very best meals I've ever had, and absolutely one of the very best restaurant experiences I've ever had.

We took the server's advice on the menu, and - it was fabulous. The three dishes were superb and delicious; wonderful taste treats that held our interest on every bite.

The service is, how to describe it, \"business casual?\" The entire staff is professional, pleasant, helpful, and the charmers charm and the less extroverted on
es serve like the pros that they are. The management must be awesome because the staff truly seems to love their work and working there.

We were not even especially good customers - we were a half hour late and we needed to dash early for a show, and they were all, \"no worries, we'll tell the chef, we'll take care of you.\"

If I lived here, I'd be eating here once a month. If you live here, you should eat here more often; if you're a visitor, THIS is a destination restaurant."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this restaurant for a long time. Great ambiance, although tables are a little too close together. They also have a patio on King for outdoor seating in the summer. Susur Lee's menu does not disappoint. Plates should be shared. 3 plates are more than enough for 2 people. Must try: the slaw. It really is a work of art and has 18 different root vegetables en julienne. The black cod melts in your mouth, I definitely recommend it. The slow braised beef is also good, but somewhat heavy. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been to Lee Restaurant on two seperate occasions; once with a larger party and another with a smaller party. Both were memorable and exceeded expectations.

I've tried their signature dish, Singaporean Slaw, which gave start to a great dinner. It's a mixture of 19 different ingredients that left your taste buds confused but asking for more. The texture was perfect as I am a huge fan of crispy salads but not crispy to the point it leaves your gums hurting.  

Another dish worth mentioning include the Green Curry Chicken. The chicken was cooked to perfection; soft and tender, and not at all dry. The curry gave the zest that made it a memorable combination. 

The staff there seem very interested in the dishes when presenting them which gets you pretty pumped to try each dish you order. They're friendly and attentive; all you can ask for. The ambience is quite cozy but it can get quite loud on a busy night. If you happen to dine there on a day that Susur Lee is present, he will make his way around the tables and make small talk. It was a wonderful surprise for my friend as we went there to celebrate her birthday. 

Overall, I didn't have high expectations going into dinner, but left with a good lasting impression. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto from LA and was told this was the place to try. I'm sorry but the food was horrible. I tried a few plates and every single one was actually pretty gross. The worst plate was the grilled octopus, chewy beyond any octopus I have ever had I actually couldn't bring myself to even finish it. The scene was more a drunk businessmen man vibe then anything, and the Sangria they sell walking around the tables tastes like some crappy kids juice box. I'm a foodie and if you're looking for a food experience take a pass on this place the food is horrible. Disappointed on my birthday with a gross meal."}
{"text":"Visiting for a second, first time was for Winterlicious, wasn't wowed by anything, we were sitting in the lobby, service weren't the fastest and the food was just on par with such an establishment, nothing stood out. However the my second time here, I had a great experience, service was amazing, it was a very busy Friday night, we were led to the back to a semi private room. The decor and ambiance was so relaxing and cozy, it really made the whole experience so much better! 

We ordered their seasonal special, a seafood platter to share and some drinks, it was great, great flavor profiles. Everything was fresh, no complaints whatsoever. 

Definitely would come back to the food, the ambiance and the service!"}
{"text":"So I came here long long time ago ... More than 5 yrs?
The tapas style thing was interesting, small portions for some, larger and filling for others, and each having so many different flavors coming at you and dancing in your mouth in every dish. 
Some I remember were better than others. Over all tastey!! 
However, what knocked my dress off was the 'Slaw.

Back then it was 19$ for the slaw.

I swore I would come back and order the slaw for myself ! I didn't care how much it was.

Tonight, I visited again.

25$ slaw. 

Worth every penny!!

This time it seemed much larger... Shared among 3 ppl - (though it said for 2) and we were feelin the fullness kick in already.

We ordered the scallops, and polenta and ravioli. The first two came and we were done. The waiter actually forgot about the ravioli but we cancelled it anyhow. So delightfully full.

Yet I could not resist trying the dessert ... Fruity creme brûlée. Again perfect flavors.

No wonder it's been years and he's still doing so well. 

If you live in t.o or are just visiting, please try the slaw."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto and came here for dinner. The food was unreal!! I'm very sad that I do not live closer as I would love to go back as soon as possible. 

I went with a group of three and we ordered a bunch of different items and shared (my favourite thing to do). We started with the Singapore slaw which was delicious, the presentation was also phenomenal. The salad itself stands pretty tall as it is a pretty generous portion, the waiter then mixes it all up in a whisking motion for you. We also ordered the green curry, the fried tofu, the slow braized beef and the lamb special. Everything was amazing! 

In addition to the food being delicious, the staff were also very well trained and polite. Not only were they attentive, but they could easily rhyme off each ingredient of the 15+ item Singapore Slaw tally. They were also great with the recommendations."}
{"text":"Slaw was amazing! They describe everything that's in it as they serve it to you and it all works great together.

Fun fact: the slaw is likely based on yusheng or laoyu (a popular tradition in SEA), which is a salad tossed by multiple people in celebration of Chinese New Year. Each ingredient is tossed in step by step and represents different auspicious wishes and at the end, everyone tosses the salad together!"}
{"text":"Upscale asian fusion restaurant with glass tables and wooden panel decor.  The place isn't cheap, so expect to pay at least $60 a head, but service is very professional and the drinks are satisfying.  The burnt orange manhattan definitely hits the spot.

For a large group, the prix fixe arrangement is typically offered and is a good way to sample the whole menu.  

Highlights include the shrimp cheung fun, caramelized black cod and of course the signature singaporean slaw.  

On the sweeter side, the tong yuen (rice dumpling with nougat) tastes as good as it looks.  Fantastic meal overall."}
{"text":"I don't get the previous reviews. We ate the cheese burger spring roll and the signature dish Singaporean slaw.... Not impressed at all, the spring roll did not have a lot of taste, it was only spicy and the slaw was ok but not wow ! Then we had the black cod.... No taste, honestly just not good. Second entree was braised beef, no words for describing how bad this was...
Of course, we did not take a desert."}
{"text":"After a long Winter and a rather unstable Spring, so glad PATIO TIME has finally arrived!!! My friends and I have been going around the city, looking for good terraces to kick back, get some drinks/food, people watch and most of all enjoy the nice warm weather.....

Friday night, my friend and I walked down on King W, patio hunting. We landed on .... drum roll.... LEE!! Resto wasnt too full on a Friday evening but the patio was. So we grabbed some drinks and appies while waiting for a table to free up (which did in less than 30 min, yay!!!)

Started off with a Lee Lemonade ($18) which was ok. We didnt taste much of alcohol but perhaps it isnt a bad thing considering I was already tipsy when we got there LOL!

For starter, we ordered a watermelon salad. Its creative combination of spice, skim feta and hot sauces along with cubed watermelon woke up all kinds of senses in my tastebuds. It's like waking up muscles that have been asleep from lack of exercises....=P

Then we shared (as it is a sharing type of resto) a seafood platter (elegantly presented and delightfully tasty), a singapore-style slaw (w/20 ingredients at $20) and green curry chicken (saucy and sweet). Now I have to say, everything has a zing to it so if you're not into spicey food or spices, this might not be the place for you. 

Now I gotta warn you, this is no typical fancy Chinese resto. First off, they dont serve rice!!!! Yeah!!! NO RICE CHINESE RESTO is rather unheard of. I think that's what Susur was going for..... Break tradition and be the talk of the town (not just Chinatown =P). Also the portions of the dishes arent as generous as most Asian food joints. It's fusion right so he infused Chinese food into French cuisine portions. 

Service was not bad. The girls who served us were really professional and friendly. One of them has a cute Aussie accent. Just adorable!!

The bathroom (as I would always like to comment on in addition to everything else) was sanitary, but rather small. Not super fancy as the rest of the resto is but clean and practical, haha!!

So $200 later, we found ouselves satisfied by the fact that 1) we tried this resto, 2) sat on the patio, 3) enjoyed a lovely meal, 4) tried something new/different and 5) looked posh being at Lee. But not likely to return anytime soon. It is something you just check off from the list of to-do's and that's it!!

Dont get me wrong. If you enjoy fine dinning, by all means, try Lee. You will be have a good time!! I'm just not really the fining type!! After all, what matters most to me when it comes to meals is the company. Food is essential, but who you have it with makes all the difference...."}
{"text":"Three strikes and you're out. Came to this restaurant because the owner was in Top Chef Canada and my gf was a fan.  

When we sat down, i reached to pull my chair in and grabbed a handfull of wet chewing gum. Really?  Gum on the bottom of the chair in a supposed 4-5 star restaurant? ---  Strike 1!!!

Told the waitress about it and she was gracious enough to remove the gummed up chair, however, she left me standing there while she brought the chair to their basement. Btw, i would have appreciated it more if she had removed the bad chair and replaced it with another chair that was at an empty table 2 feet away. She did not and I stood there for at least three or four minutes before I decided to grab a chair for myself instead of waiting for her to return. When she did return and saw that I had a chair already, she looked a little puzzled.  ---  Strike 2!!!

When we did finally receive our first dish which was the Singapore Style Slaw, the person who brought it explained the ingredients to us but unfortunately, we did not understand a word she said because of her thick European accent. She then proceeded to mix the salad at the table and I thought \"...great, we have table service\". When she finished mixing it I thought she would plate it for us but she didn't, she finished and just left the table. We ended serving it ourselves.  ---  Strike 3!!!

At the end of the meal our waitress came over and asked us if we would like to see a dessert menu, we declined and asked for the check. She left then came back about 3 minutes later to wipe down the table but did not deliver our check. Instead she came back to ask us how everything was. We said it was fine and asked for the check again. We finally received the check about 10 minutes after we first asked for it.  ---  Strike 4!!!

The food itself was meh --- not worth the $25 - $40 entree prices. The food was not bad but not outstanding, in my opinion maybe worth $8 - $15 per dish.

We were sat next to another table which was barely a foot away from us. It almost felt like we were on a double date with another couple that we didn't know. The tables were so close together i was almost rubbing shoulders with the guy at the next table.

I know that i said three strike but this was so bad i had to give it more than three strikes.  I think I've said enough."}
{"text":"This review is totally based off of a service mess up and not the food. The food is usually great every time I've eaten here. 
I called too book an important dinner for my fathers retirement. I had called and made a reservation for 7pm on the patio. Called back earlier the day of the reso (may 17) to make sure we were all set and the patio was open (weather depending). It was a beauty night out and the patio was open. 
Our group of 6 arrived 10 minutes early. 
Go up to the host and ask for our table. Boom, \"I'm sorry sir their is no note on the reso saying it was a patio reservation. \"

I called twice, once for the reso and once to double check the patio being open. It was a beautiful important night for my family and you guys absolutely laid an egg. Manager douche bag handled it like a little wiener so we just decided to not spend our money or time at a establishment as flakey and mismanaged as Lee. 

Complete bush league move by your team. I loved this place up until that evening last week. Thursday may 17, 2018. -will never spend another nickel in this below average establishment."}
{"text":"I attended a wedding for one of my best friend's here last weekend. I had always wanted to come try his famous Asian slaw but I don't think I QUITE believed how good it actually was until I tasted it.
Amongst some of the other food was there Cheeseburger Spring Rolls, Curry Chicken, Tiger Shrimp, Tuna Tartar and an amazing array of desserts.
We sat in their \"secret\" room that you have to walk through the kitchen to get into. The girl who served us our initial cocktails wasn't great but the rest of the servers and staff were amazing. The atmosphere was gorgeous, the food was to die for and all in all, it was a perfect evening and wedding!
I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for the Man's birthday dinner and WOW! This place is totally worthy of the hype! We went for the crowd favorites - the slaw, egg rolls, and green curry chicken. For dessert, we went a little lighter and got the sorbet. Everything was spectacularly delicious. Honestly, I assumed before coming that I'd be underwhelmed by the slaw because really? Slaw? I just didn't get it. But NOPE. It's perfection - so many flavours and textures and I only got chastised twice. Once for stealing all the sauce and another for using my finger to make sure I didn't miss any - sorry dude, I couldn't help myself. I only wish we could have ordered more, but we were totally stuffed. 

Lastly, super special shout out to our server, Marc! He was absolutely charming and gave us great recommendations! 

Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand the hype about this place. I'm all for overpaying food but there needs to be quality and substance. The tofu was undercooked and the service was slow as hell. Would not come back ever."}
{"text":"I tried lee for my birthday back in march and I'm literally still dreaming about it!!

The service was phenomenal and the food was insane!! We ordered 2 apps and 2 mains and it was more than enough- we left very very full! The slaw was perfection and the top chef was my favourite main! 

And the SERVICE!! Phenomenal and very attentive.

The interior is also beautiful! I see people eating on the patio now that it's summer but I don't think I ever would just because it's way too beautiful inside!!! 

I can't wait to return and try new things!!"}
{"text":"This is a late review, but it is based on an experience last year.

When I first went to Lee my husband and I loved it. We swore it was one of the best restaurants in town.

When I had a special big night out last year (to celebrate something work related) I decided to go to Lee and had horrendous service. The entire time we were rushed and treated like we were second class patrons. After the meal we followed up with the manager, and while nice about it, they did not seem to care too much. 

If you have lots of money to spend, and can do big nights out... well this place is pretty delicious, but I wouldnt go back. We do not usually splurge on fancy dinners and when we do I want it to be special, not like we are wasting their time or they want to hurry us for the next guest."}
{"text":"I came here for a company event and was so impressed with the atmosphere and quality of this restaurant. Since it was sponsored, I can't comment on the cost but the quality was top notch.

The Singapore Slaw was so good - I'm not much of a salad person but it was flavourful and the texture was great. The Mexican Goat Cheese Tart was also fantastic (and reminiscent of Pizza - but like expensive Pizza :P). 

The Stone Crab Spring Roll was okay - mainly, I wasn't a fan of the cream cheese inside as it felt a bit heavy and the flavour felt off from the rest of the menu.

We also had the Roasted Beet and Persimmon Salad which was nothing special - I'm not a fan of beets so that might have been why.

The Carmelized Black Cod was astonishing - such great flavour, beautifully cooked and fluffy. I also really enjoyed the Curry Roasted Chicken. 

The stars of the show were the Slow Braised Beef and the Curry Braised Lamb Beggar's Purse. Wonderfully cooked, I would say the Lamb is slightly better than the beef. I would go back just to get the Lamb, the Cod, and the Singapore Slaw. :) 

They even gave us chopsticks at the end as a cute souvenir. Such a nice touch to end of the evening. A highly memorable meal and one that I'll keep in mind if I ever need a venue to host an event."}
{"text":"Lee's sets a new standard for French / Asian fusion cuisine in the City of Toronto, from its signature dish to desert, it is complete with taste, artistry and execution. 

Since I started travelling to Toronto, I have set out to really try and define what the city means to me from a food perspective. My business colleagues in advertising are no strangers to good food and restaurants, sharing their time between Toronto and Manhattan. So, when they suggested Lee's I did not hesitate for a second to go, skipping lunch in anticipation.

Susur Lee's claim to fame in their eyes is somewhat kitschy as the \"Iron Chef of Canada.\" The food was fantastic wether it was beef on mashed potatoes, black cod on a turnip cake or the scallops, everything was great, with a unique twist.

The first thing I mentioned to my dining companions was how the space Lee's occupies reminds me more of Portland than Toronto. This part of town is previously home to textile warehouses at the western end of the \"entertainment district\" on King Street. Exposed wood ceilings, low-slung pin lights and orange \"up\" lights along the wall set the scene for a great dinner. Floor to ceiling windows allow you to see the snowfall out on King Street. In the back, the ceiling is slung low over a horseshoe bar with deep red walls and an oriental red fabric lamp. A subtle and perfect nod to the Asian-inspired food you are about to eat.

On to the food...Kirin in hand, I hit the jackpot as this night was going to be a sampling of the chef's favorites. Dishes are served \"family style\" but the portions are such that an individual can order one by themselves, kind of like large tapas. However, this format allows Mr. Lee to do some more interesting things that deserve to be shared like the duck confit wrapped in pastry and topped with goat cheese. Complemented with dried pineapple to bring some sweetness, this dish was sublime, offering different textures and a balance of flavors all meant to be together.

It all started with the signature dish, Singaporean style slaw. People at the table were all shouting in anticipation \"it has 16 ingredients\", \"No! it has 14\", \"No. 18\" and on and on. I think I may have even heard a \"niner\" in there. Those who know me, understand my irrational love of cole-slaw, well this takes it to a whole new level. Crunchy, sweet, spicy, soft, then a hint of sesame oil, next bite, more ingredients an entirely different sensation. Hard to describe but very easy to eat, get one to share and become a Lee insider."}
{"text":"I found the menu items hit or miss and the service pretty terrible. I have afforded 3* solely for the watermelon & feta cheese appetizer and the Cod main. 

Myself and 5 friends visited the restaurant on a Friday night, initially for the summerlicious pre fixed menu. However, after viewing the a la carte menu at the restaurant we opted to share amongst the table, ordering from both the summerlicious and a la carte. 

After reading the reviews on yelp we opted for the Singapore Slaw (two portions, adding the tuna sashimi to one and the salmon to the other). The Slaw was OK, the sashimi tasteless.  I think reading the yelp reviews had increased my expectations too much concerning the slaw. We ordered the watermelon and feta cheese & the Thai chicken from the summerlicious menu. The watermelon was delicious, the best appetizer by far. The Thai chicken came out as jerk chicken, which was nice just unexpected. 

For main, we ordered the salmon and the beef from the summerlicious menu and the cod from the a la carte. The cod was so good, I would go back just for this dish. The salmon wasn't very good, although the salmon was cooked well the sauce tasted like a tin of tomato. The beef dish was ok, just a little bland. 

We also ordered a dozen oysters, and although the waiter forgot to bring them and we had to re-ask just before he brought the desert, they were worth the wait. 

The service itself was not very good. It took forever for our waiter to bring us just water, the drinks were sat on the bar for a while before he brought them over. He was slightly rude and judgemental about the choice of drinks we wanted. For instance, I like bombay gin, they had it on the menu, so I order it, but the waiter gasped with a slight ew and said they have better gin options than that. If the gin is so terrible take it off your menu! There was really no reason for the bad service since our table was booked for 10pm the restaurant was not at its busiest."}
{"text":"I really really loved this restaurant! My husband took me here last night for my bday dinner. I'm not quite sure why it has taken my husband and I this long to try Lee but I'm so glad we finally did. 

We ordered the Singaporean Slaw, Caramelized Black Cod and the Slow Braised Beef. The Singaporean Slaw was delicious! It is made with 19 ingredients which they mix all together table side. The Cod dish was very very nice. The fish itself was melt in your mouth soft and the turnip cakes that come on the side of this dish were very tasty. The Braised Beef was also very delicious and served over a leek purée which was really nice and light. 

Service was really great at this restaurant and overall was a great dining experience. Will definitely be going back here."}
{"text":"Came in on a chilly Friday night for our 6:00pm reservation. (a definite must as this place was full by 7pm) As soon as we stepped inside we were greeted by a hostess who offered to check our coats. We were then taken to a table in the center of the restaurant in the middle of the row of a bunch of two seater tables. I asked the hostess if we could have a more private table (as there were many vacant tables surrounding the outer corners of the restaurant) Without hesitation she said let me see what I can do for you. She then took us to a table on the other side of the restaurant behind the bar where only one other couple was seated at a table about a foot away. I loved this seating much more as we got to see all the bar action and had a great view of the entire restaurant.

For drinks we definitely wanted to try out something from there amazing cocktail list.

Saketini - Moonstone Plum Saké, Tozai Living Jewel Junmai Saké, Belvedere Vodka, Yuzu, Flower Petals
Good balance of sake and vodka without being overly sweet. Had a bit of a floral taste which was appropriately garnished with flower petals.

Our server was amazing that night, very attentive and informative. He went over all the specials with us and described dishes in detail like I never seen before. He recommended that we order 2-4 dishes plus dessert for 2 people and that all dishes are meant for sharing. We ended up ordering 4 dishes plus 2 desserts and were overly stuffed by the end.

Steamed Edamame  - Mustard sea salt
The edamame was cooked perfectly cooked in a creamy mustard sauce which as a mustard lover I highly enjoyed it

Singaporean-style Slaw - OMG! It's totally worth all the hype! First of all its huge but it's sooo tasty we had no problem devouring it all. Not only is it beautifully presented but it's one of those rare dishes that hits all your taste buds - sweet, sour, salty everything perfectly balanced. The tangy dressing, crunchy and refreshing thinly julienned slaw, and nuttiness from the peanuts ooo man was it ever good!

Caramelized Black Cod - Cantonese preserves, miso mustard, dim sum turnip cake
A thick juicy deliciously melt in your mouth fish! The miso mustard and preserves really gave it a great flavour punch and the creamy turnip cake is unlike anything I've had before.

Korean Style Marinated Beef Striploin (8 oz. U.S. Prime)  - Garlic mushrooms, roasted pear, blue cheese & dill sauce, arugula
Another stand out dish! Phenomenal and a must try as well! First of all it was a perfect cut of thick meat without a trace of  gristle or fat. The steak was cooked beautifully medium rare but the the pairing of the garlicy mushroom, sweet pears, bitter but fresh arugula and salty cheese wow again another flavour explosion! And the sauce the meat was sitting in was highly addictive, I couldn't help but dip every single morsel in it!

Warm Molten Chocolate Cake  - caramelized jackfruit & banana, vanilla bean ice cream
Another perfect pairing sinfully rich hot chocolate oozing out of a crispy chocolate cake paired with cold and creamy vanilla bean ice cream is always a winning combination.

Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar - vanilla crème anglaise, blackberry purée, French wafer
As a true born chocolate and peanut butter lover this a winner for me before it even hit the table. Fudgey dense chocolate with a subtle peanut flavour and crunchy wafer paired with a tangy blackberry puree to cut the richness complimented the dish really well (think pb &j doused in rich chocolate)

Overall I have to say Lee is one of those rare restaurants where not only is the food  presented beautifully but the flavour profile is unlike anything you ever tasted before. You can tell how much thought is put into executing each dish and care in creating something that is innovative and mind blowing. Definitely a restaurant worth checking out!"}
