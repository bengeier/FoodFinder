{"text":"I stumbled upon this place, while too starving and freezing to wait at the subway station for my ride. My eyes never travel to this side of Dundas because I am loyal to the place directly across the street (the previously reviewed \"Apache Burger\"). Yesterday, however, I took the pedestrian route, and ended up right in front of a place I'd driven by hundreds of times, but never set foot in.  Who wants to cross a busy street in such brutal weather? Not I. Thus, I walked into this new-old dive and had a good feeling when I saw the two serious-faced, European gentlemen behind the counter. They looked like they could be long-lost uncles of mine, and this somehow translated into assuming they knew how to make a mean Souvlaki (for the record I'm not Greek, but somewhat close to it). One never cracked a smile, the other traded minimal banter with me, and I must say that this worked well because the food really spoke for itself, and I think they knew that.  The pieces were large, juicy and tender, the rice and salad just right and the potatoes were perfect- the flavour was soaked all the way through and they melted in my mouth. I've never been to Greece, but it somehow tasted more \"authentic\", more homemade than most of the attempts at Greek food that I've tried (which I know are mostly watered-down kinds of places for the most part, since I don't usually seek it out), and I really got the feeling that the way they cook here is probably not so different than the way they do at home."}
{"text":"These guys have closed but not before I had a chance to try them.  The place was pretty sketchy. It was one of those places where I make a mental note of what I ate so that in the eventual fact that I get food poisoning I know what to tell the ER when they're pumping my stomach.  The food was good though. Pretty standard, nothing fancy."}
{"text":"Better than apaches with more selection. Try this place out if you want breakfast or lunch or a burger. 4 stars only because they are not open late."}
