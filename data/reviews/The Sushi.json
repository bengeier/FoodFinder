{"text":"We were just looking for a place to eat when we stumbled on The Sushi. It was 7pm and there wasn't a single car in the lot. Hmmm, was that a bad sign? Well, we took a chance and we found nice d√©cor, the loveliest of wait staff and an AWESOME sushi chef. I treated my 2 young friends to an assortment of long rolls and we were all happy campers. My son fell in love with all of it, the atmosphere, the lovely women and the beautiful selection of sake choices. Did I mention we were hungry? It must have helped. I would go again in a heartbeat if I didn't live so darn far away."}
{"text":"If I could give it less then one star I would! WORST SERVICE! I honestly have ever experienced in my life! We ordered AYCE, Ordered one roll each to start with. Comes out fast so plus points for that. I ordered a coke. The waitress never came with it. After our plates being empty for 15 minutes we decided fuck it let's go somewhere else. The restaurant was empty. Only us in there! 3 waitresses! They were just standing there and talking. I even had to say hello? And they still didn't stop talking to each other. When one girl finally comes, We say that we just want to pay for the two rolls and no longer have the AYCE. She says I don't know if it's possible. Don't know? You guys are apparently at work to socialize with each other. Leave the only customers you in your whole restaurant waiting while y'all are chatting off in Japanese. We ended up paying for 2 rolls without even a apology! The waitress said it's slow today? So? Do your god damn job with the only customers you have. I didn't even want to pay for the two rolls we got! If y'all want a good sushi place here in summerlin my fellow sushi lovers try yummy sushi! We went to this place because it was 25 minute wait to even make a order over there!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. One of the best place to eat sushi in Vegas. The buffet price is not bad. One of my favorite roll is the Rainbow row also the daisy. I would highly recommend you this place."}
{"text":"This place is a great,  laid-back environment.  Very clean and so much room as far as seating. The all you can eat sushi is delicious.  I'd recommend the salmon ass.  And no that's not a typo.but it is fucking delicious."}
{"text":"Went here and customer service was horrible not only did they decide a smoke break for the sushi chefs was more important than making their customers food they decided to yell it across the restaurant that they forgot the order never coming back again totally disgusted!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that my favorite sushi place in Henderson is Osaka's but since this place is closer I go there often. I really enjoy the rolls and their service has always been perfect. The food is always super fresh & delicious."}
{"text":"Rice was too dry, service was slow at best and for what we got the price was way to high. The decor was nice though but I can get better sushi from albertsons for a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"We had a really great experience at The Sushi.  We had just completed a decent bike ride and weren't expecting much from this place because of the location (in a gas station strip mall).  Mediocre is what we expected and what we got was some fresh sushi, awesome service and a really clean and inviting ambiance.  I might even say that this might be a new favorite for mid-priced sushi in the valley.

We had the crispy rice with spicy tuna, the yellowtail shoulder (himachi Kama), lots of nigiri-salmon, yellowtail and tuna, and a couple of their specialty rolls.  The fish was a great temperature and tasted fresh,  the himachi Kama was super delicious and tender.  We also had to indulge in some soporo.  

Our server was really nice and attentive,  the music was good that was heard overhead, and the sushi chef looked like he was legit Japanese.  

This place is fabulous!  Go here and don't judge by the gas station location.  It's what's inside that counts."}
{"text":"Really love this place.  Service can be slow but I just order a lot so I always have food.  Friendly people.  Good sushi.  Big menu.  Love to try things.  Chefs pleasant.  Enjoy my time here."}
{"text":"This place has always been very good and friendly staff, but recently the service has been horrible. The waiters and waitresses walk around and take forever to ask if anything else is needed. Food is great but good service would be nice as well. Very dissent"}
{"text":"The food is not as good anymore it's very bland and the service is horrible. We're no longer regulars here."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of sushi places in Henderson looking for what may be my local favorite and I think this place is it! The service is SO friendly - sweet and attentive but not stopping by annoying you every 3 minutes. The food was delicious and the fish tasted very very fresh. We got sashimi and a couple rolls - all great. The regular things like miso soup and seaweed salad are nothing unique, just good as usual. We tried a few of their fun rolls, all of them had fresh ingredients and a balanced taste, very delicious. The only one I wasn't crazy about was one that had some Cajun seasoning... I thought \"wow, I haven't heard of htis combination before\" and promptly learned why. It was okay, just not great. Really though, everything else has been delivious every time I've been and I think this place is a gem.  Give it a try! Only reason not for 5 star rating was that I think the roll prices could come down a $ or two a roll to be on par with other restaurants."}
{"text":"I tried it again and the food is still good but I have to say the servers are still on probation .  Need more training here . The third time should be a charm if not I'll go somewhere else and try again ."}
{"text":"We have always liked coming to this restaurant because the sushi is so good however the service is always been terribleeeeeee!!!! today was an ultimate terrible service day we walked in at 12:30, only 3 other tables sat- the server did not understand a request for two menus and was rude when asked again. She started to take our order and the door opened with more people- as i am ordering she WALKS away from me to sit these people. RIDICULOUS! With no acknowledgement or anything to me! Comes back does not apologize and we asked if we could sit at the sushi bar instead she said \"whatever\" we move and she says something in her language to the sushi chef and he walks past us twice with again NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. Needless to say, we got up to leave, I'm so disappointed because the food is so good. But we will NEVER be returning"}
{"text":"We have been frequenting this place for a couple of years now, and we'll start with the positives first: 

They have a very good menu with some very delicious rolls. The Vegas roll is one of my all time favorites. The quality of the fish is very good, and the rolls are made well as to not fall apart when you pick them up. 

Unfortunately, the good does not come without the bad: In the past we have had some issues with service during busy times, however it has been much better over our past couple of visits. There is also an additional charge for nigiri which definitely deters many from ordering it.

Ultimately, this is a good sushi joint I will continue to return to, as long as the service times remain reasonable. The prices here are affordable, the environment is comfortable, and all of the sushi is made with quality fish."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start with this place...when it opened we were super excited like everyone else because there are NO restaurants in this area of Henderson...so the first month it opened we just had to go...Service was sooooo bad I almost walked out...and I am a server so if MY patience had worn thin, imagine other diners...we wound up staying and wound up having an annoying night out and an underwhelming food experience...I vowed to NEVER go back....then I got a gift certificate as a gift for The Sushi....so I thought ok I'll give them another go....it was their first month open when I had visited last...maybe things were better...NOT THE CASE......the food was still just average...overpriced for sure....and the service was unbearably awful....my husband suggested we pay and leave...he was super irritated and it takes a lot to irritate him...as we were leaving the owner stops us to ask about our dinner....REALLY?! So I let her have it...and you know what she has the audacity to say to me? Oh...the service is only bad from 6-9...come back at 10 p.m. next time...no apology nothing...and why would you think I'd ever come back again....let alone at what time you tell me to come?! So very annoying...don't waste your time...or money...go to I Love Sushi on Eastern or Yummy Sushi on Marks Street..better food, prices, and service...this place is a joke...they know nothing about running a restaurant or any sort of business for that matter..."}
{"text":"Great local sushi joint! Always fast service and prices are reasonable. Food is great! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is my new sushi AYCE place.
I ate here 4 times just in 2 month.
only $17.95 for luch, $20.95 for dinner.
their rolls are so good and fresh.

- If you like soft shell crab or sweat sauce try their starbucks roll. 
- If you like spicy, try die hard! chef will give you choice of the suace 1 to 5 
- If you are fan of rainbow roll, try candycane roll you will like it.
- If you cannot eat sushi,they have big appetizer menu like Korean bulbogi, salmon kama, teriyaki, mushroom cap, ramen, tempura, and baked mussels (what I liked about their mussel is that they don't put too much sauce like other restaurents so you can taste actual mussel not the yum and eel sauce.)

If you like to add nigiri, it is extra $4 for nigiri all U can eat.
I had uni, amaebi, Ikura with quail egg, yellotail, garlic tuna, and salmon sushi and everything was so fresh. 

The service was GREAT too.
the waitress refilled my beverage frequently, checked if everything was ok in our table."}
{"text":"Wtf happened? Every time I visit this establishment, it gets worse! Half of what I ordered never came, I was asked to stop eating even though we ordered a combination of 6 rolls). I asked for additional spicy mayo and was told that sufficient sauce was provided with each plate. My 2nd order was denied - I was told I needed to stop eating. What happened to this place and why in the world did I just leave an all you can eat place hungry....

I never thought I would ever need to write a negative review but you guys earned it..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my daughter and sister. Very pleased with the food and service we did the all u can eat and the rolls we're amazing the seaweed salad was delicious lots of variety on the ayce menu plus desert;) our server was Jenny she was really nice and attentive everything was great will defiantly go back"}
{"text":"So I've been going here for over 18 months, and the quality is always top notch.  Went out last night and the first thing we noticed was the name change on the door.  We were a tad skeptical but decided to go in anyways.  Drinks came out quick but it took the waitress almost 15 min to come back to get our initial order, and about 20 more min for it to come out.  Turns out it was her first night on the job, the business had just gained new ownership, and they are about to revamp the menu (the waitress said the AYCE option would probably be going away).  Sad, because this place is my favorite AYCE joint in Vegas...guess it's time to find a new place!"}
{"text":"Greated at the door , very friendly. .. seaweed salad and tempura zucchini cane promptly. Tried sarimi, sushi rolls and tempura fried cheesecake.... We enjoyed everything... Place is very clean and service came with a smile."}
{"text":"I heard from a couple people about The Sushi so I decided to give it a try. I made sure after reading the reviews that I found the correct one. I did, but only after going to the one across the street first. 

I feel this place has great potential. I like the space of the restaurant. We were seated in a booth near the sushi bar. We ordered Salmon and Albacore nigiri, some rolls, oysters on the half shell, and uni. 

My problem started right from ordering. The sushi chef behind the bar calls out to us and asked for our order. It was awkward calling out our order. It's not like people weren't at the bar and we were the only ones around. We were at a booth, the waiter should've come. 

The nigiri was good, it seemed fresh. My oysters however weren't very cold. They weren't warm, but should've been a little cooler. It made me skeptical and people shouldn't have to be skeptical about the food they're about it eat. 

Then I eat the Uni, my favorite and must have every time I have sushi. First bite, Uni awesomeness. Second bite, the crunch of the shell of the sea urchin. Completely disappointing. 

We decide to order some sake. It comes out and things got worse. My sake glass has lipstick on it. I felt like I coudn't get a break with this place. I left extremely dissatisfied and disappointed. 

Way too many good sushi places in Las Vegas to ever give this one another shot."}
{"text":"Yet again I tried out this place to see if it got any better! The service was awful the food was worse than the service. I needed a magnifying glass to see the fish in my sushi rolls! Why is it that I go back here? I am just so shocked every single time that it sucks! They took off a couple of my go to items when I have come and they reduced the desert menu. I went for my daughter's birthday and wanted them to put a candle in her dessert but they didn't have any. Nothing was good I have absolutely nothing to say about this place. And even the one good thing about this place bothers me because the ambience is amazing it's a beautiful restaurant and it's such a shame that it's so awful. Go across the street to the little sushi hole in the wall next to savers.... I haven't put my review and on that one but I've been there several times and it's definitely my go to favorite! The sushi is the worst sushi!"}
{"text":"The service was very poor . It's a shame they forgot my food and then decided to comp it but the fish had been sitting there for 20 minutes .. No thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Sunday, maybe 2 patrons. With my 4 year old and wife we go to sit at sushi bar and told the kid can't. That's a first ... so needless to say we did not even sit down."}
{"text":"Went here on 5/14/2016 for lunch, second time here. Both times were fantastic. Pick any item on the menu and you wont be disappointed. Everything was fresh, but the service was the highlight of the day. Nuri was our waitress, she was incredible."}
{"text":"5 Stars for Samurai Kim and staff! Exceptional fresh fish, great rolls and customer service."}
{"text":"This place is terrific! 
The all you can eat anything on the menu for $20 you can't beat that! The sushi is great. We try new rolls every time and we love the Starbucks roll. By far our favorite. The staff is wonderful they are very nice! I can't say anything bad about this place!! :)"}
{"text":"Yeah, so Old Henderson has some pretty dynamite sushi.  I dined here last summer in the restaurant, which was quaint and clean.  I've also got take-out rolls.  Favorite would be the \"Tastes like my ex-girlfriend.\"  Lol.  Their Grand Canyon roll is also another one of my favorites.  Plus, it's right up the street from my casa, so that is a definite plus.  Go and try them out, you will be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"best service, i have been going to the sushi since the opening, the quality service & sushi are great. i usually get 18 piece sushi & a salmon roll. its always open & fasts service. ill be back."}
{"text":"So here we thought we found our new home for AYCE sushi yumminess, until this past Sunday. 

We came for dinner, we waited about10 minutes for a table for four though, in plain view there were tables/seats available to accommodate us, no biggie we waited patiently. There were only two servers, we rolled with the tide and practiced patience for i.e. water refills and order taking.

The defining moment for us was...my husband paid the bill with plastic, our daughter left paper for the tip, she placed the tip at the inside of the table and not in the check holder. As we walked out, I heard the male server open the door and say something, I didn't hear what he said, however my son did. My son asked, \"did you hear what he said? I said, \"no\". My son heard the male server open the door and said \"are you f@*king kidding me?\" I presume he opened the check holder and saw 0 on the tip line of the signed check.

My son went back into the restaurant and confronted the male server, who of course denied saying anything.

Though it's a further distance away, we will go back to making Sumo Sushi our home  for AYCE."}
{"text":"Owner Lina doesn't understand how to keep a customer especially when her cash register doesn't work and it charges your card by mistake three times. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding when you get \"IN\" with the chefs. Talk to Danny or JJ and they'll hook you up. (Joseph is good too). We are demanding sushi-lovers,and they make us some great stuff... without using rice. It's challenging, but they pull it off every time. The wait-staff is really nice, too. My wife and I love it, and go once a week. We've been to about 5 others including some on the strip... nothing close to this ! GO !"}
{"text":"I got a to go order for a combo of chicken teriyaki and beef teriyaki and it came with a little scoop of rice and the salad was horrible.Only a few little pieces of chicken and beef! It was a total ripoff and guess what?$10.95 for the whole combo!!!! I'm never going there again! Oh and if u want good sushi and stuff go to yummy grill sushi. Man that place is bombing! P.S. not literally."}
{"text":"I love there sushi, but they need to get more people help them out with service, it takes so long till you get your sushi then they bring the wrong food to the table. I was told you can't order all you can eat till everything is done but I was done with my food my wife was still working on her food it was her order. I stop going to this place there is so many other place in town."}
{"text":"Every time I stay in Vegas, I always make sure to visit this sushi restaurant. I try to order something different each time and am never disappointed!  Today I tried the Megabox and carrot head. Both were as beautiful as they were delicious! Service as always was polite & quick."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Been coming here since it opened. Was a 5 star rating. Recently they must have changed ownership because all of the servers have changed out. The service is not very good right now. Two times now we were seated and waited 15 minutes before someone even came over to greet us. Throughout the meal its the same thing. You have to flag servers down or they wont check in on you for additional orders. Too bad, used to be a go to place. Hopefully they get it together."}
{"text":"It was ok sushi. Nothing especially memorable. Not family friendly in that the names of the rolls are not fit to be said by littles. The service was not so good unless you were a regular. Smiles and sunshine for regulars. We are looking for a regular sushi place and this will not be it. The rolls themselves are 101 ways to dress up a california roll. Pass."}
{"text":"Awesome local sushi spot. The inside is clean and the staff friendly. I love the names of their rolls and the Saki selection is decent. I had the #33 - Taste like my ex-girlfriend. I totally recommend it. My only complaint is the house salad dressing is sesame, while I prefer a ginger dress on my veggies."}
{"text":"I just went here tonight with the gf (Sunday at 7).
We were able to be seated right away and it seemed somewhat slow with only 2 other groups there (though a few more came in as we ate).

I wish I could find an online menu of theirs so that I could list the items that I had, but they were all quite delicious and fresh.

I'm not sure why people are complaining about the size of the roll for the price, but they seem fairly standard $8-14 a roll with the more expensive ones generally being larger.  All rolls were a standard 8 pieces.

The waiter was quite nice, they had a lot of unique rolls and other items.

Also, giving a restaurant a lower rating because it's far away is stupid.

Anyway, the wait staff were able to take care of us just fine, though I could see that if there was a sudden rush that the service may have gone done.

The atmosphere seemed pretty standard for most sushi places with what sounded like the endings to various anime songs playing (I'm exaggerating).

Overall the food was quite tasty, appropriately priced, and we will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"We are regulars at the sushi but I was a bit disappointed with the service last night. We had to Ask for a menu because they forgot and it took about 30 minutes before we got any food. The food was great quality is always but I just didn't feel like a valued customer"}
{"text":"Wow, a friend in Henderson was raving about this place so we drove in from Boulder City to give it a try.  Fresh and Quality are there main traits not to mention a clean Restraunt. 
The sashimi are big firm slices of fish. 
Our new Sushi place from now on"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the sushi is good BUT the service is absolutely TERRIBLE!!  Sushi chefs standing around doing nothing but cleaning up for the night with a full restaurant. When I looked at the time they were still open for 2 more hours!!  Waitress never came around and when she did she was less than enthusiastic to help. This place has really gone down hill and its a real let down. Only go here if you're prepared to be super annoyed."}
{"text":"The service was good and the atmosphere was nice. The gyoza was pretty good though it's hard to mess gyoza up. I gave them three stars for a couple of reasons. The dipping sauce for the gyoza was ice cold. The katsu sauce for our entrees were both ice cold. The breading was to thick and borderline raw falling off the meat. It came with a small portion of rice and vegetables that appeared to be from frozen no fresh. I was expecting more from a restaurant with four stars, it's unlikely we will be back.  I should mention we did not eat sushi, it's called The Sushi so maybe the sushi is amazing. The people at the sushi bar appeared to be enjoying their sushi and the sushi looked appetizing."}
{"text":"Really great sushi. Tastes like my ex-girlfriend a fave."}
{"text":"Came here about a week ago with a few friends. We arrived about an hour and a half before they closed. I ordered 4 or 5 orders of yellowtail and the waitress told me they were no longer serving AYCE because they were about to close.

This was quite disappointing as I knew they had an hour of operation left. I deduced she simply didn't want to serve that much nigiri because it's more costly for these places to serve real sushi than spruced up imitation crab rolls.

We told her never mind and started to leave. She goes into the kitchen and comes back as if she had to get approval to serve us AYCE. Sadly, she and the chef were the only ones there.

So we order our food. The whole table orders a few yellowtail and when they arrived, one plate was normal, one plate was brown and decrepit. It appeared as though they had pulled fish out of the garbage can, rinsed it off, and slapped it on rice.

I eat yellowtail quite frequently. It shouldn't be brown. Or purple for that matter.

I told the waitress I didn't want to eat the rotten looking fish and she said \"at least eat some.\" Yes. At least eat some of this diarrhea inducing assfish.

I had to pay my friend to eat all of the gross yellowtail as a dare.

-$5

The nightmare didn't end there. As we went to pay, the waitress proceeded to include gratuity in all of our bills as if we weren't going to tip. Probably a smart move on her part.

And yes, I did have the runs the following day.

DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch on our way back to Vegas from Hoover dam. The waitress was sweet and  recommended the mega roll at $13.95. It was delicious! My husband had the shrimp roll at $9.95 and it was really good too. Before we ordered they served us cucumbers in a light sauce with pickled ginger and wasabi. I don't care for pickled ginger so I gave it to my husband. I thought we got a lot of food for our money so we are very pleased. Another plus is that the restroom is not only clean but luxuriously decorated. The restaurant overall was very upscale and clean. Highly recommended and I would go back.
Also there was a wine list and bar but we were driving so didn't order any liquor. This would be a nice place to take a date."}
{"text":"Sushi was very good. Service was great too. If you are in Las Vegas, recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, we were waited on by 3 people, and they were all very attentive, one was just straight up cool, she really made us feel welcome. The food was great and I tried everything I could. I certainly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I went there for dinner with my mom. The service was fantastic. The miso soup was a great appetizer. We ordered the Dragon, the Pearl, & the Snow Covered tuna. Each was DELICIOUS!!! The pearl was our favorite. We could have ordered a few of those & been content. The dessert was to die for. We ordered the mango sherbet covered in white chocolate! OMG!! 

I that the price was not asking too much. A lot of reviews complained of the price but I say it was worth it. I will DEFINITELY be returning there."}
{"text":"I actually love this place every time I go. The service was good and fun. I am not happy with the menu changes so I took away one star but food is still worthy as well as the service."}
{"text":"Be warned: Soft shell crab = imitation crab at this place. 

I ordered a wet dream roll, thinking \"soft shell crab\" meant deep-fried, intact pieces of soft shell crab, as is standard in sushi restaurants, but instead we got imitation crab mixed with mayonnaise. The waitress explained to us that their soft shell crab is ground up and mixed with imitation crab in all of their rolls except the spider roll. Huh? That sounds like a waste of quality crab to me, but that's their story and they're sticking to it.

We were satisfied with the rest of the food and their willingness to exchange it for a different roll, but the menu here is over-reliant on mayonnaise and fake crab, so we won't be going back."}
{"text":"We come here about once a month. This has been our favorite sushi place for about a year now. We always sit at the sushi bar and I usually have the same thing--Sapporo Light, masago, salmon sushi and caterpillar roll with sauce on the side. The sushi chefs are the best--friendly and funny!! The sushi is fresh, presented well and generously portioned. The complementary cucumber salad with sesame mayonnaise dressing is always good. Prices are competitive with other non-AYCE places. I would've given 4.5 stars if possible but unfortunately it's not. The reason for the 1/2 star deduction is the service. We are always seated promptly, however drink refills are never forthcoming unless requested and then it takes a while to get them."}
{"text":"The sushi is awesome best service best people and food can't go wrong we go there every Friday or Saturday never bad always awesome I'm Travis Waldo try it can't go wrong"}
{"text":"This is my favorite AYCE sushi place in the NW.  Everything is fresh & tasty.  The decor is nice inside too.  It's a great place to hide from your family so you can eat like a pig or bring friends & family to eat like a roman."}
{"text":"Uhhhh......what? We chose to try this place after our regular sushi place was closed for remodeling for the week. After about 5-7 minutes of awkward standing around just inside the entrance, we were noticed by a waitress who had a look of shock and despair on her face like she had never seen a customer before. Seriously, you should have seen it. We couldn't help but laugh because it was so outrageously awkward. We were finally put at a table even though we requested to sit at the bar twice. We placed our first order of all you can eat rather quickly, which was nice. And then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. Meanwhile, for entertainment we watched the chefs and waitresses fumble their way through 30 minutes of bad service to other guests. One man sarcastically cheered when he was finally able to place an order (he was already seated when we walked in). There seemed to be a lot of confusion about which sushi roll went to which table. There was also a lot of confused wandering taking place. the waitresses were basically walking in circles as if forgetting where they placed their car keys. Finally after becoming quite hangry, we decided to politely flag down a waitress and tell her that we had enough and we wanted to leave. She gave us a lame excuse that they were busy with 3 large tables (about 5 people at each table) and several (8 people) at the bar with only 2 sushi chefs.

We took a risk trying another sushi place because we are in LOVE with Naka Sushi (just across Lake Meade if you're looking for quality all you can eat sushi) and it bit us this time. We will absolutely not be going back to the sushi. Naka's sushi is worth waiting until he reopens on the 17th!!"}
{"text":"Cool ambiance. Sat at the bar so service was fast and friendly.

Sushi was hella fresh and I always like when they make it in front of you. Price was reasonable because it IS fish.  

Not 5 stars because they converse in Japanese the whole time, in front of us. Lol. It was cool but because I didn't understand I felt maybe they could've been talking about us. Lol"}
{"text":"I won't go on and on about how this may be the best sushi place in town, cause let's face it, who has tried them all? If you are thinking to yourself that you have, you're a sushi-loving liar. A new one opens almost nightly!! 

This place is definitely high quality food. Super nice staff, fast service and a variety of seating options if you're with a big group or a loner that just had to kill that raw fish craving. My 2 favorite things about this place are the variety and the price. Most places that do all you can eat (this place does not) price their rolls so high they force you into getting it. The Sushi has reasonably priced rolls, where you can leave super full and still feel like you didn't get robbed because you didn't get it all for $27. I think we have even eaten more food here and paid less than when at their competitors. The variety is awesome. If you like some cooked fish mixed with a bit of raw, all raw, all cooked, they've got you covered. The sushi special is great, so is the candy cane and the put your hands up. Oh and when they warn about the spice it's not a joke. 

Great, now I'm in the mood for sushi."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Super fresh sushi! great rolls. Great ventilation(you don't leave smelling fried) its so sad that people don't give this place better reviews people in Vegas just seem to jump on the bandwagon of what's \"cool\" and \"trendy\" and since this place doesn't have blasting music and the chefs taking sake bombs with their customers no one seems to rate it higher!"}
{"text":"This place is far far away from my residents, however, I was attending this establishment at the request of the boyfriend who said it was amazing when he use to live in the area. 

They attend to their customers very well. That was the thing I think I enjoyed the most since I am not a sushi eater. Most of my reviews on sushi places come from the non-sushi eater perspective. 

Keep in mind that we went to the all-you-can-eat dinner session where it was $20 I believe. So my portions were on the small size, almost like tapas sizes. 

Number one item I always get are the dumplings, aka, Gyoza here. I have had better for sure. They did not have much of a taste to them as ones I have tried elsewhere. So not a big fan of them here. 

Number two item was the chicken fried rice. Now that was delicious. Their flavoring was very unique. I could not quite figure it out, but was very good. My favorite dish of all. 

Number three and four as the chicken dishes I tried. I tried both the chicken teriyaki and the breaded chicken dish. I loved the teriyaki a lot, but not the breaded one as much. It was a weird taste. 

Last of course was miso soup. It was pretty good, but pretty average. Definitely had better.


Overall it is a nice place and I enjoy it, but for a person who doesn't eat sushi, there is not much variety for me there.  I would only go back if those items were the things I wanted at that moment."}
{"text":"It's tough to find an all you can eat sushi place that is fairly priced for a-la-carte as well. The rolls came out fresh and fast! The server was attentive and friendly and kept our waters fresh even after the bill was paid. 
We have tested at least 7 other sushi spots in the area... we will definitely return here."}
{"text":"I came here looking for $21 AYCE sushi. Just to clarify, $21 include rolls and appetizers. Nigiri is an additional $5. No biggy. The sushi was good, fresh, very similar options to other AYCE joints in Vegas. 

I only gave it 3 stars because I had a rude waitress. I was here with my bf.  We were 2 rolls in to our meal when I placed my second order of 3 additional rolls. She proceeded to tell me that we would have to consume all of it. Duh! This isn't my first rodeo. I said, ok. Then she went on to say she'd have to charge us if we didn't eat it all and that she didn't want any trouble. WTH is that supposed to mean?!?! I was courteous the whole time, I don't know where that comment came from!  

This place was good but so are others I've been to. Fish was fresh but there wasn't anything spectacular that I would go out of my way for..."}
{"text":"LAST STRAW, NEVER RETURNING.
Let me just start by saying my review has nothing to do with the CHEFS, who I might add are taking care of a group at the bar and they seem to be enjoying themselves, my review is a reflection of the service ive received here over and over by the servers. Now normally I get good service at The Sushi, my aunts recommended this place to me in 2012 and I kept coming back, especially after this one instance where the chef made our entire meal a chefs special knowing we are not picky and love everything they dish out! The last 2 years this place has been going down the drain on service.
Today, 8/31/15 i am sitting here at my table as i write this and i am being blatantly IGNORED. nothing irritates me more than a server that ignores a table, and im the only person in a booth at 4:52pm on a Monday...  seriously? 
In 30 minutes ive gotten 1 water and my 2 appetizers.. the least this server could do is ask how were doing... although she hasn't even smiled once at us.
The food here has always been great and ive always liked their Sake choices, especially their White Peach Hana Sake. The atmosphere is casual, and on a busy night you really feel good vibes in the air. I think the restaurant is a great dining experience. But i just can not keep giving my money to a place that hires such rude people. I can tell even now that this lady must want to get off work. Let's see some more smiles! -_-

Bottom line: excellent food, poor service. I'll just stick to Goyemon."}
{"text":"NEW OWNERS - HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! Customer service was disgusting, can't believe they behaved the way they did! Very rude , missing orders - never coming back.."}
{"text":"They used to have very good food.  HORRIBLE!  The salad was floating in water.  The tempura shrimp was raw and the sushi was skimpier that it used to be.  Will never go back !!"}
{"text":"Sadly, I'm not going to review on the sushi..... My wife and I were craving sushi and decided to try The Sushi. As we walked in, there were customers at the sushi bar and a few at tables. Not extremely busy. We waited what seemed liked forever to be seated. We weren't asked about drinks and no water was ever brought to us. We literally sat there 10 minutes wondering if we would get some service. A few minutes later we decided to go elsewhere because we felt completely ignored. Had hi hopes for a non AYCE sushi house."}
{"text":"This is my hubby and I'd favorite place to go for sushi. Great food! I love the Dragon Roll and the Cucumber Island is so delicious. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas visiting a friend who lives near here.  What a great place!  All you can eat sushi, with interesting selections, and each were very well presented .. not your typical stuff.  Great price too.. people were nice too, authentic japanese-run place.  Nice atmosphere and flatscreens at the sushi bar too.."}
{"text":"I. LOVE. this place! It is by far my favorite restaurant for sushi. I've never had a bad experience here. I've tried other places, but every single time I do that, I wish I would've just stuck to the best...which is the Sushi. I recommend the cucumber islander, Pearl special, golden California roll, mushroom miso soup, garlic edamame, and the Japanese lasagna  my mouth is watering just writing this. This is the closest sushi place to my house, but I would drive miles for this deliciousness. I choose to go here every year for my birthday for the past 5+ years. I never get tired of it! For any special occasion, this place is the first that comes to mind. My family loves it. 
I could go on, but I truly love this place and hope you do too. If you're a sushi lover, give this place a shot. You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"When we first tried this place a few years ago when it first opened, we weren't too pleased with the pricing & the quantity.  It was just ok though.  We just thought it wasn't worth it because of the prices.  I went back here w/ my sis-in-law for lunch after school one day about a few months ago & she introduced me to some of the dishes she has tried.  And I must say it was pretty damn good! Still a little pricier that some usual places my husband & I go but I guess they must've changed up the menu or something.  The rolley bowl, screaming O, & fat ass is really good.  I have yet to try some of the other dishes they have on the menu.  Aside from the food, the place is clean (even the bathrooms ^_^) & it's not super packed. I like how they got their dining tables set up too.  Very intimate.  The people here are really nice.  Definitely would go back to eat there again...."}
{"text":"I came here during my break between classes and their lunch \"box\" or bento was mediocre. The tofu in the miso soup tasted like plastic and the salmon teriyaki I ordered came smothered in teriyaki sauce and burnt on the bottom! Probably won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Love this place. We go at least twice every time we go to Las Vegas. The prices are great and the sushi is fresh and tasty. The sushi rolls have hilarious names (\"I Love My A$$\", \"Tastes Like My Ex-Girlfriend\", \"What The He//?\"). The servers are attentive and the sushi chefs are quick & will briefly talk to you while preparing / handing you your food. Love the sushi chef who will announce your dish in a low voice as he's handing it to you, and if you have your face in your phone he will say \"hai!\" to get your attention. Adds a little bit of charm to an otherwise unremarkable atmosphere. But you aren't here for atmosphere anyway. Try the Tuna Poki! Huge serving for $12.50. Large house hot saki only $5.50. Only complaint is that the men's room isn't maintained so well. If we're really hungry we'll spend $80-$100 in this place and hang around for drinks, would be nice to not be faced with a gross bathroom door that hasn't been cleaned in ages."}
{"text":"Excellent & fast service, every plate was delicious and quite affordable. Nice atmosphere and peaceful music. Chef was also positive & very friendly. I will return many times!"}
{"text":"It's was a great place previously but now down to earth. From menu delete best lots, and today I'm coming before close 40 minuts. I'm driven 20 min, because yelp show this place close at 11 pm. Finally shef say me - not today and go out, don't ask maybe I'm wanna stay in bar and drink. Doesn't have time to another restaurant, because loose time for him. Bad service"}
{"text":"Good sushi spot in Henderson. It's not an all you can eat but they serve great rolls and sashimi. We recommend the Playboy and Pearl special rolls. I like to get their sashimi platter (chef's choice), come with house salad (love the dressing), miso soup. Great service and chefs can be entertaining. Kinda feels like a dive but is upgraded. Certainly a place to check out."}
{"text":"Using iPhone app Siri, when we pulled up the restaurant, it showed 5 stars, one review. When I went to review myself, all if the sudden, 3 reviews, 3 stars. 
Seems pretty good though. Very pleased with jalape√±o poppers. The Amigo2 was slot spicier than the poppers. Not bad, just not expected. Sweet endings was also pretty & pretty tastey. :)"}
{"text":"I'm a sushi lover . And this place was delish!! Need to go again soon def recommend getting the lasagna  sushi"}
{"text":"Went for AYCE Saturday night for $20 a person, great price! The sushi was fantastic and the service was quick! I love this place. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 or 5 times because it's a mile away from my house.
The Sushi has been good it's been bad.
The service has been good and bad.
It's like a coin toss.
I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"If you sit at the bar you seem to get taken care of better.  The tables seem to be less personalable."}
{"text":"The restaurant is nice and big,The Food is fine... But the service is terrible, 20 min between each plate, be patient and make sur you have plenty of time to go eat there :-( ... When the plate finally come out, It wasn't what we ordered. I won't recommend the \"all you can it for 22$\" it's limited to 45min ... So the time for 2 plate to come out !"}
{"text":"I just discovered that the Dave-O is the bomb. Miso soup with clams! We are very lucky to have a good Sushi place in old Henderson."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here recently the food was great the portions were perfect the ambience was comfortable and it is close to my house. I immediately relaxed upon entering.  We were greeted and seated immediately and the waitress was friendly.  The problem occurred when we were ready to leave it was hard to get the attention of the waitress to get our check. The lady at the table next to us was finally able to get attention of someone at last.  I would definitely go again but they need to stay focused on customers that are ready to go as well as when you entered."}
{"text":"Sushi here was as good as it is at many other sushi places. Floors/bathrooms dirty, 1 server in Restaurant serving approx. 8 tables...All you can eat menu is small to read and \"tricky\" rules...(Bring Glasses) They advertise all you can eat @ $19.95 as long as you don't eat the \"Nigiri\" and if you do add $5 making it $25 like any other sushi place...I mean, eating sushi is eating the Nigiri..."}
{"text":"Their ayce price is 17.95 for lunch and 20.95 for dinner but these price are not include nigiri. If you want nigiri for all you can eat, you need add $5 
I do not recommend this place"}
{"text":"Sushi people! My second luv after pizza. Now this place is alright with me, its in a Minnie strip mall very unassuming,however , there sushi is very well prepared and the flavors are excellent. They have funny name for there rolls for example my favorite is I love my ass its topped with super white tuna and filled with an excellent Japanese salsa. Yum! If your in the area and  want sushi this place will satisfy your sushi hunger. It's also normally priced none all u can eat sushi place definitely two thumbs up for food. Service was a little suspect, but I mainly am a food jugde people! Happy eats my Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Haven't had bad sushi at 'The Sushi' (make sure you're at the right place) Summerlin goes here, and it's very, very good ! We don't do the AYCE, but have seen a lot of that.. and it looks good. We avoid the carbs/rice and request specific things... and the guys here come thru with some excellent stuff ! Rolls without rice.. try it. It's (understandably) more pricey, but well worth not feeling \"AYCED\".  Great Job !!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I recently moved from San Diego to Summerlin and we were in search for a great sushi restaurant to take the place of our weekly sushi joint in San Diego.

I was a little skeptical of the sushi when we first pulled up because you hear horror stories of strip-mall sushi restaurants. When we first walked in I was pleasantly surprised by how clean and modern the restaurant was. We were enthusiastically greeted and sat. 

I was also skeptical that most of the sushi restaurants in Summerlin were all-you-can-eat. We don't have much of those in San Diego because they usually mean poor quality fish in more quantities. However, this is not the case at \"The Sushi.\" This might possibly be the best sushi I have ever had (not at a 5 star restaurant)- for the price. 

Go for dinner and get the specialty rolls. I have tried many of them and they are all so delicious. The sushi rolls are large so I normally only can get two- but anything with the screaming O sauce is delicious. If you have the stomach for it, you can order a half roll for your last roll which gives you the chance to order something new. 

Their spicy garlic edamame is also delicious and so is their deserts! Needless to say, we go every week now!"}
{"text":"Pretty good AYCE sushi. Recommend Naka Sushi across the street though.

This place is cheaper than all of the other AYCE sushi in town, but they don't give you nigiri for that price.

A few times, I have suspected that they might use lower-quality fish towards the end of your meal if you've eaten a lot.

Also, I think they talk about me in Korean.

Other than that, its pretty good."}
{"text":"Waited an hour and 45 minutes for 3 rolls and some nigiri. They were absolutely unresponsive to our inquiry on why it was taking so long and that we wouldn't be returning. Lied about our last order being in the way when it wasn't even placed to begin with and then took ten more minutes giving us our cards back. They took 3$ off of the one order that wasn't all you can eat where the person was literally just waiting there for us to some day in the future get our food. Ridiculous. Never again"}
{"text":"The service was nothing special, we actually didn't have napkins, chopsticks or silver wear until we asked for some when our meals came out.. but that was no big deal. The food was great! I had the ex-girlfriend roll, AMAZING, FANTASTIC, TERRIFIC... Super yummy. My friend had the sushi plater and was exactly what he was looking for. Kept our drinks filled and gave nice sized glasses for the drinks. I'd be happy to go again and again and again!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  The ambiance is outstanding with a very open and nicely decorated floor plan.  Lots of nice woodwork, with appropriate greenery.  The food is outstanding, but the best part is the incredible service.  Amy and Sharon were great.  Very attentive and there was zero waiting.  What an incredible gem in Summerlin!"}
{"text":"seriously, the BEST sushi ever!!!!!!!! i'm asian n i grew up in cali and this is BY FAR the best sushi ever!!!! :)"}
{"text":"OK, so I discovered this place last week when a close friend recommended it to me.  Small restuarant, but big on taste.  I went on a slow night, so service was relatively quick.   Our server was very good, and made awesome suggestions based on what I told him I liked, right down to the texture of food I was looking for.

I don't think the food was expensive at all, comparable to most places off the strip.  This is a casual place, so don't go Sunday best.   Nice atmostphere considering you're in Henderson.  

Did I just say that?   I believe I did."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!  AYCE was such a save and had great sushi. Very fresh. The customer service was good as well. This will be one of our main sushi joints."}
{"text":"Two stars only for the gal who brought us our drinks right when we sat down. She was sure to tell us it was her day off and she was just here to help (I assume with drinks only because she never offered to take our food order) Ok...?

I cannot comment on their food...WE NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO ORDER ANY! 

After a while (maybe 5 min or so?) I noticed that no one even came by still to take our order. So then I started the stop watch on my phone. 4:45 later, still no one has come by to take our order. At this point we put money on the table for what we thought the one beer might cost that we ordered them all got up and walked out.

But wait...they were sure to tell us \"sorry for the wait!!!\" As we were walking out the door. 

Really?! Get it together! If you're short staffed, fine. At Least come by and let us know you haven't forgotten about us, you'll be with us shortly. And don't tell me you're here to help but NOT HELP, why not go ahead and take a food order if obviously someone was too busy to help us. I dunno what the heck was going on to where you could not service a customer who was there to eat and spend money in your establishment. But, again...get it together. Pay attention to your customers."}
{"text":"The  staff is so friendly, always great service. I have eaten sushi here 8x and never had a bad meal. Great value and everything is delicious! Love the Tiger Roll and Salmon lover."}
{"text":"This place is blocks from where I live. Finally decided to try it a few weeks ago.. And it's amazing! Friendly and fast. Haven't been let down yet. The menu is well done with a few comical names that made me smile! I come here about once a week because it's made my rotation of places to eat out. I absolutely would recommend it to anyone in the area looking for a great sushi place."}
{"text":"I definitely come here because of the location. I believe it is the only AYCE in that summerlin area (my \"go to\" for non-AYCE is Yummy Grill Sushi) 

Yesterday in particular I was craving for super white tuna so I decided to make a stop here. 
They offer AYCE with two choices: 20 for rolls + 4 extra if you want AYCE nigiri.
 
My boyfriend and I ordered some nigiri we got super white tuna and garlic tuna and they were OK. They put lots of rice with a little slice of fish. Then we got four additional rolls after that (we were really hungry haha) 
We got the starbucks roll, which i thought was too sweet with all that sauce they drenched on it. 
The japanese lasagna (it's our staple with rolls, because it's really good to pair it with a spicy roll) 
And a spicy roll we ordered was the Die Hard which was okay, it wasn't super spicy. We dipped it in a side of garlic ponzu for more flavor. 
(I can't remember the name of the last roll we got) 

Needless to say, the flavors weren't on point. They seemed lacking flavor or drenched with too much sauce to add flavor. 

The service was good, everyone was friendly. 

I definitely think that their sushi rolls need some more effort. This place does have potential."}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious! The 'tastes like my ex girlfriend' roll was amazing, shrimp tempura, rainbow, spicy shrimp rolls were all very tasty. The strawberry mochi was great too :)"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE thing about The Sushi is: location, location, location.  It's right down the street from me, so very convenient.  If I didn't usually feel too lazy to drive any farther; I MIGHT go to Osaka, I Love Sushi, or Sushi Bay instead, but The Sushi is a solid option.  The food is good, (Dave-O, and Sushi Special are my favorites, though Don't Touch Her Mustache is a close third...possibly in part because of the name) the prices are comparable to pretty much every sushi joint, and there are decent lunch specials before 3pm, etc.  They DO have brown rice, which isn't terribly common.  I like that about them. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"The food is always decent when we come, except the last visit we had; the fish wasn't that fresh. And I like to feel like I know what I'm talking about when it comes to fish since I work in a Japanese restaurant that sells sushi as well. I would give a four for food, but they lose a point for service. It's never really busy when we visit, but severs seem to be confused and dazed. They never really know what's going on. Other than that it's a decent ayce right down the street"}
{"text":"Horrible service. We waited over 20 minutes to simply order our drinks. The restaurant is severely under staffed. It seems the only 2 waiters kept their focus to the customers at the bar only. All the customers including myself were losing patience and could not wait any longer. All in all it has taken well beyond an hour for 3 rolls. My last visit here."}
{"text":"For quick sushi this was fairly easy and tasted good. I'm not a huge sushi lover but I was just feeling it today. For 2 in the afternoon it took forever to get someone so I could pick up, but she was nice and my rolls were ready to go. And they didn't have a problem leaving the avocado out for my allergies-so definitely allergy friendly. The rolls were good, but not the best sushi I've ever had. You definitely get what you pay for. I'll come back though, since it's so close to my house and the service was nice once I got someone."}
{"text":"Definetly not a take out resturant...... Staff seemed confused when taking my order.... I also believe that they forgot to input my order.... 35 minutes sure is a long time..... However, they did offer me water or tea while i waited..... They also took 20% off the bill for their mistake....  Pleasently surprised with the interior of the resturant.... it has a nice cozy vibe to it.... very intimate.  Food was good.......will go back for a sit down meal."}
{"text":"I do very much enjoy this place. I am
Pretty picky about my sushi. The only thing I would say that sometimes is difficult is, the inability to communicate with the staff. Most do not speak very good English (which is fine) but if I don't know what it is I'm looking for... I am on my own lol! The place is clean which; I am certain that everyone can agree that this is an important aspect of a good Sushi place. I've only had one incident where we were disappointed. It looked as if the fish May had been left uncovered... They quickly took it away and responded to the issue immediately as well as apologized profusely. We come to The Sushi at least once every two weeks sometimes once every 3. My 11 year old loves it! Try the cucumber passion (no rice) my fave!"}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time until they started raising their prices. Food is not bad, but staff is a bit oblivious sometimes."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi and it's less than 5 min away from my house. Clean and nicely decorated restaurant with up to date music playing. I always get ayce and it's pretty cheap compared to other places, only $20. The spicy tuna cracker is the best:)"}
{"text":"love the sushi!

 my co-worker recommended this place and the ambiance is nice, 
the names of the sushi are funny and awesome! 

appetizer: screaming o: delicious and has a bit of spicyness to it. 
                        tuna collar: delicious and my fav so far!! 

dinner: udon soup was fabulous, full of flavor and different meats and veggies.

great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I'm no sushi aficionado, but this place is great.
Everything we ate was wonderful. We did a late night AYCE, which was nothing short of amazing. I also feel a sushi joint's 'other' items should be worth something, and they are here. I loved the iced green tea more than the hot,which was also great, and the miso soup and soft shell crab were awesome.
Was going to try the green tea mochi, but I realized how full I was after the tea! Next time I guess. Would definitely return, and probably for the AYCE again too."}
{"text":"Wow, sushi was good, but the fried rice was the best we ever had. Service was great, fast and helpful. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have not been to another sushi restaurant in a long time.

The sushi loyalist that I was would make the drive to EN on the other side of Henderson.

I have since decided to brach out and see what else the valley has to offer.

Conveniently located just off the freeway, The Sushi is tucked into a small commercial center.

Nicely decorated and the ambiance is low key.

Everyone from the waitresses to the Sushi chefs were happy and pleasant to deal with.

There are lot's of rolls to try. They include \"Don't touch her mustache\", \"Taste like my ex-girlfriend\" and \"I love my ass.\"  Freaky names but tasty just the same."}
{"text":"I don't plan on coming back as they don't have AYCE option, yet their sushi is very much AYCE quality. I can understand places like Miko's not having AYCE because their menu is extensive and fish consistently fresh. The nigiri at this place was just mush, the rolls we had kept falling apart and the prices were on the higher side.

When we first walked in, the restaurant was empty. I noticed the decor was very lovely and modern and I had high hopes that we had found a nice go to sushi joint near the house. As we are sitting down, my butt has not even touched the seat, much less looked at the drink menu the server asks what would we like to drink. \"Uhhh...guess I'll start with water \" is all I could say. I then ask if they have AYCE..she almost scoffs and says no. I think to myself, either this will be some bomb ass sushi or this woman is a delusional witch. It turned out to be the latter. As we are looking through the menu in the span of FIVE minutes she comes by at least 3 times asking if we had decided, increasingly annoyed each time. NO PRESSURE. Eventually we opt for baked mussels (pretty good), nigiri sampler (eight pcs of mushy old fish for $19.99)..oh that comes with a miso soup which I imagine salty bath water would taste like. Ex girlfriend roll ($14.95 and fell apart) and Tiger roll ($12.95..confusing... 5 of the 8 pcs had salmon on top, one pc had half salmon half nothing and the remaining two had \"white tuna\"). It took forever to get our last roll.... we were checked on once where a different server asked if I'd like my water refilled. At least we got the check and got out of there as quickly as possible. $60 down the drain. I think this place gets rave reviews because a) this is hendertucky and b)there are no other sushi joints in the vicinity. 

Poor service, poor quality of fish, no AYCE, and stupid prices."}
{"text":"Had an enjoyable dinner here after finding out the other Japanese restaurant in the area that we wanted to visit was closed for Easter Sunday. The service was impeccable! We were greeted and seated immediately and our server was readily available, without being intrusive. The food was not only delicious, but they had a great variety of items to offer. They even had agedashi tofu - something my daughter demands from a Japanese restaurant but it's usually so hard to find. I am somewhat of a Japanese restaurant snob since I am Japanese and from Hawaii. All of the food was delicious and I couldn't believe how quickly it came to our table. I'm used to waiting a long time for rolls. My husband enjoyed my Spider Roll so much that he ate mine and had to order another. And I loved the presentation of the Kane Age (soft shell crab app). The only food that wasn't quite right was the chicken teriyaki. We didn't complain about it because the rest of our meal was so enjoyable, but the server noticed that we left it on the plate while we packed up the rest of our food to go, and asked about it. I honestly told her that the texture seemed a bit off, and she immediately rectified it by letting us know that she needed to let the kitchen know so that it wouldn't happen again. She later came back with mochi ice cream for us, complements of the sushi chef/manager. Way to make things right! Our server was attentive and cared enough about our dining experience that she questioned and then did something about it. My daughter asked if we could come back before we end our vacati, because our dining experience was so pleasant!

Edited to add: per our daughter's request, we returned the following night. Had a different server, but our experience was exactly the same. Courteous service, prompt food, happyness all around."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch.  Nice staff, tasty rolls, quality fish and good pricing.  These guys are good!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Delicious sushi. There a re a lot of sushi places in town.  This one is legit."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in the corner and not visible from the main street on Horizon Ridge. I forgot there was a restaurant here till I had a random convo with some guy at the grocery store who recommended it.

The minute I stepped foot inside I said to myself  \"Ooo..I think I love this place already!\"  The decor modern chic, clean and simple, earth tone colors, pretty cherry blossom mural at the back wall, lush green bamboo plants that lined the entryway gave the place a certain calmness. It simply won me over in the ambiance department.
 
Came right before the dinner hours so it wasn't too busy at all. Just a few patrons at the sushi bar and 3 other families in dining area that surrounded the sushi bar.  My server was the one who greeted and seated me.  He was fantastic throughout the whole time, real pleasant as were the rest of the staff who either refilled my drinks or served my meal.  

Had the Shrimp & Veggie Tempura and Yakitori Shrimp for my appys, Beef Teriyaki w/Miso Soup for my entree and Exotic Bomba Sorbet for dessert. The shrimp and veggies were lightly battered and decent size, Shrimp Yakitori was fresh and I like the asparagus with it, my entree, the sliced beef was a little tough and chewy, the teriyaki sauce was good, NOT the runny thin marinate kind, it was thicker so the flavors were more intense and sweet tasting.  I give my entree a \"B+\".  My dessert was the bomb!!  Exotic Bomba found here! It's a sorbet with mango,passion fruit and raspberry sorbet  in the middle, and covered by white chocolate. Decadent and refreshing at the same time.  

The Sushi definitely has the WOW factor so far. I look forward to many more visits and trying out more dishes!"}
{"text":"Yummy.  We looked for the Yelp reviews and found a neighborhood gem.  Fresh and tasty rolls!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"We went for AYCE on Monday night.  The price was $20 each which sounded very reasonable.  We had Spicy Tuna Poke, Salmon Roll with spicy crab inside and jullienne cucumbers served over radish;Spider Roll; Die Hard Roll, Salmon Lover Roll, Dragon Roll; Baked Green Mussels and Green Tea and Strawberry Mochi for dessert.  

It's a good price for a lot of food.  We had a very attentive server.  Nice decor in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Before choosing The Sushi as the final decision on our first AYCE experience in Las Vegas, I definitely did my research on Yelp!   I chose The Sushi because the value ($21), minimal house sake price ($3 sm/$5 lg) and because the reviews that stated the average roll is $10.  

We went at about 5:30p so it was relatively slow but as it began to pick up, our servers Eileen and Wendy were very accommodating, had GREAT personalities and were very quick with all of our orders.  

I only gave the restaurant 4/5 because I have had better quality sushi and taste does play a big part in the experience.  

I would highly recommend this restaurant as an AYCE joint, but not if you want good sushi Ala carte.  However, the service hasn't been better at any other sushi place so for that and especially because it is difficult to find sushi servers with a lot of personality and friendliness, I would suggest you try it out!"}
{"text":"This best is the best sushi bar I have ever eaten at.. Great prices on the all you can eat toooo... Try the \"OMG\" and Pearl Special\" they are to die for... My wife and i go there about once a month or so... A little less now they have changed management."}
{"text":"This is a very good sushi house. The all you can eat offer lasts for 45 minutes and they really churn out the sushi during that time. You have unlimited access to their full sushi menu during this offer.  The sushi is made fresh and to order.   We consumed a huge amount of sushi during that 45 minutes.  They have other typical Japanese entrees as well.  I am not from this area and local friends brought us here.  It was a good find. Hope its as good for you if you visit"}
{"text":"Normally i will treck over to the other side of town for I Love Sushi... but this place is just 1.5 miles from my house and I think this will be my new go to place!  
I went alone early on a sat night.... the staff was super friendly and everything was very delicious!"}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. I did enjoy the sushi rolls but did not at all like the miso soup it was nasty!! I do not recommend the miso soup and really how can you go wrong with miso soup, but overall I came for sushi and they were spot on!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here not long ago. She cannot eat dairy because she has a sensitivity to the proteins in milk and she can get severe headaches from it. We told the waitress that she couldn't have dairy but the chef accidentally put a small piece of cream cheese in her food. Unfortunately she didn't realizer it until she had eaten some. We politely asked for them to give us her all you can eat on the house, since they made this mistake. Because that agreed to do this, and they treated us fairly, I am giving them 5 stars. If they had not, this review would have been much different. Fortunately, my wife didn't get sick and all was well. The food was great as well as the customer service. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Oh, The Sushi, why do you not AYCE it?

You are so close to where I live and I love sushi so much! But paying $10+ for a roll is not going to happen, especially since I will have to limit myself (well....more like my pocketbook will limit me).  I want to eat all the Yellowtail until my little heart is content, but at $4.50 per nigiri double , I would just have to settle for one order of yellowtail this time.

But on a serious note, the sushi really is good, I had a screaming O, yellow tail nigiri, and some other roll that cost $13.50 (OUCH)  but I do not see a point to go to a restaurant that does not have AYCE....fatties unite!!!!!

The decor was beautiful and the service was on point. But please, consider AYCE'ing it up and I'll be there more often. Come to think of it, there are no other AYCE sushi restaurants in the area....maybe it can be you?!?! *nudge nudge*"}
{"text":"Since my daughters favorite food is sushi, this place has become a regular place for us. We've been coming here for a couple years now and love it. The staff is nice, and the food is good! The specials are almost always a welcome surprise! 
We can always count on getting a quick bite no matter what time."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new in Henderson and we're desperately looking for a  good sushi restaurant near our home. We were pleasantly surprised when we discovered The Sushi! We went about 3pm for a late lunch, GREAT service! We had the spicy garlic edamame to start and it was spicy and delicious! We also tried \"Something Wrong, The Caterpillar and What the Hell rolls...... loved them all! Highly recommend \"Something Wrong\" absolutely nothing wrong there! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Not a daring sushi eater.  I only eat cooked stuff but this place has some really good cooked rolls.  According to my person, they have really good tuna selections."}
{"text":"Went here with hubby on Saturday and really enjoyed the sushi.  In fact the best sushi we've had in Vegas!

We started with the Rolley Katsu which was crab and some kind of cheese rolled in bread crumbs and deep fried with eel sauce YUM! We then had the candy cane roll also delicious with spicy Tuna inside and different color fish on the outside, very good.  Then we had sushi mi salmon yellow tail and albacore, all were very fresh and good quality.

We went at lunch time and there was no loud noise as others have complained about."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  A decently priced, decently performing sushi restaurant in a part of town that sushi places aren't seen it.  It's a stones throw away from most of my friends, so it ends up making a perfect place to eat on nights when AYCE seems too much, and other sushi joints seem too far.

The service is friendly.  I generally order a tiger roll, some miso, and a nigiri or too.  I just stop in for a small meal, and I always seem to leave satisfied.  Lastly, and perhaps most importantly for a sushi place, their fish is fresh.

You won't find all you can eat on the menu, but you will find great sushi at a decent price in the middle of upper Henderson."}
{"text":"The Sushi's food was not so great. I would suggest not coming here if you're looking for some good sushi. I ordered the chicken teryaki. It bounced & looked like rubber. I was completely digusted and it looks like they bought frozen chicken from a grocery store. Don't order that. The fried rice wasn't so great. The spring rolls, however, were great! The vegetable roll, which my sister ordered, tasted like plastic. I strongly suggest you DON'T come here. Yikes!"}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow although the restaurant was almost empty. The sushi came out fairly quickly and was yummy. They have all-you-can-eat sushi which includes desserts and appetizers. Would recommend for a group outing"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this sushi place. We have tried so many, and none are ever as good as The Sushi. The food is delicious and the service is always great. It's not all you can eat but it's not crazy expensive. We live in Henderson and this is the only sushi place we will go to now."}
{"text":"Never again. This used to be our favorite, but over the years, the quality and staff turnover has gotten ridiculous. We will never go again, after two nights in a row being either told they were closing early, or THIS lame phrase, 45 mins before their posted time to close, \"You can only do a la carte. There is no AYCE right now.\" Excuse me? You just lost our business. Way too many places we can go to in Vegas, and not adhering to your posted hours/ rules, crappy customer service, and mediocre food won't be getting us through the door ever again."}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in Vegas....Everything as fresh as it gets...Everything here has a wow factor!  I have lived here in Vegas 14 years and this is the best Ive had.  Still trying to find one better! Have taken a few people here and they have agreed with me so far."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time tonight with a friend. The food was ok besides the fact that they forgot the avocado on my Alaska roll. And they took forever to get my friends food out (45mins to be exact, so I ate alone then watched him eat as I was done). But we both got a desert and in mine was a dead beetle. I had to excuse myself to the restroom and my friend showed them the beetle. All we got was a I'm sorry. They didn't even take my desert off the bill and they ignored/avoided us the rest of our time in there. Being in the restaurant business myself, I know that's not the way to handle things. I'm totally disgusted with this place, and unsatisfied. My friend who is a regular there says he won't be going back either, just based on how they handled this situation."}
{"text":"This has become one of our families favorite sushi restaurants. We have not been disappointed with anything on their menu, the service is friendly and fast. For the price, I couldn't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"Located in a mini strip mall right off of the Horizon Drive exit.  You can see the signage from the freeway.  Finding a parking spot was easy but we went between lunch and dinner on a Saturday afternoon.  I'm thinking that parking may be an issue for dinner patrons.  Inside the restaurant is beautifully decorated and clean.  We were greeted promptly by the hostess/waitress.  Our party were the only customers.  But as it was not exactly lunch nor dinner time it didn't seem out of the ordinary.   I ordered chicken and rice for my 3 year old granddaughter, specialty rolls, 
California roll and sushi (I can't remember the name because I wanted halibut but they were out and the waitress suggested this fish instead ).  Of the 2 special rolls one was predictably delish and the other was interesting.  I've posted pics.  The colorful crunchy topping I thought were breadcrumbs but turned out to be crushed fruity pebbles.  
Highlights : the waitress was very knowledgable and made suggestions on specialty rolls based on what we had already ordered.  waitress provided training chopsticks and mini erasers for baby to practice chopsticks with  clean clean clean
Downside:  baby's food came out after we were already done with the sushi rolls  waitress was nowhere to be found after the food was delivered.   wait time for check and to pay was unacceptable as we were their ONLY patrons. 
All in all I would probably try this place again.  Maybe they weren't up to their \"A\" game for service.  The food was good and prices competitive."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice - both at lunch time and both with coworkers.  The first time it was our entire office, so there was around 8 of us and everyone but one got the all you can eat (the one simply didn't get anything as she wasn't hungry).

Now, the prices here are pretty good.  $17.95 for lunch and $20.95 for dinner. making this one of the cheapest if not THE cheapest lunch price I've seen in the valley.

Don't let it fool you.

Both times it was almost empty in the restaurant and still the service was painstakingly slow.  The waitresses rarely come around, so getting a drink refill is next-to-impossible - even if you're trying to booze it up (yes, my office is pretty lax).

We waited forever for a roll and apparently she forgot because after talking with a coworker and staring at our table for like 5 minutes (while we'd been waiting for a basic hand roll for 10-15 already in an empty restaurant), she came back over and asked what we ordered.  How about you carry a notebook and just write it down?  (No, there is no little paper menus to mark your choices on here.)

The actual sushi and food?  It's OK.  It's not the worst by far, but certainly not the best either.  Should you happen to partake of some, here's what I'd suggest:

Spicy tuna roll
Tiger roll
Sushi Special (with eel sauce instead of garlic ponzu)
Sweet Kiss (if you're into cream cheese)
Deep fried Philly
Spicy tuna poke
Coffee parfait

The check also took just as long.  My coworker actually got up and took our check to the waitress so she could process it and we could leave.  He came back and said she was just staring into nothing.  That's, um, special.

Travel east on Lake Mead to Yummy if you want sushi - much better with everything."}
{"text":"This why I hate Yelp - the we a crap sushi place. Service was great but last I heard was sushi rolls were not supposed to fall apart when you picked them up. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Sashimi was very fresh!!!  I was quite surprised for being in the desert. I love eating at lots of sushi restaurants on a regular basis. I loved the flavor of the salad dressing. My daughter really enjoyed her shrimp crunch roll. She said the rice was really tender and slightly sweet...sort of melting in her mouth. Our service from Kate the waitress and sushi chef was good.  The next time we visit Henderson, we will definitely return here."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places to go to in Vegas. They have the best AYCE deal. $20.95. They have a great variety of rolls and everything always tastes fresh! :) the Starbucks roll is awesome... But I have many favorites. It's way across town from me but because it's so delicious, it's worth the 30 minute drive."}
{"text":"They have great sushi. I usually get the salmon and yellowtail nigiri and a Sapporo. The staff is super nice and it's a great neighborhood place; easy to park, walk in get a table and relax."}
{"text":"The sushi wasn't that great, the service was poor and our waitress was straight up rude telling us we \"had\" to eat everything or they would charge us even though we did the \"all you can eat\"... For future reference I do NOT recommend this place. Oh and to add on no one sat us and it took a least 10 minutes for us to get our menus, the place wasn't even busy and our server seemed less than happy to have customers. Screw this place!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and it was delicious! I came an hour after opening and had amazing service. There wasn't many people in here so it was very relaxing after a tough morning in class. I love finding little sushi places like this one! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, amazing food, great presentation and even better prices. Grade \"A\" restaurant"}
{"text":"Great sushi and great service, been there 5 times :)  Miso clam soup, the rolly katsu and the spicy edamame go good with the sushi."}
{"text":"I frequently pay a visit to The Sushi-- which in my opinion has a great price for AYCE sushi. The prices were $17.95 for lunch and $20.95 for dinner--the best price I've seen yet! The only downside to the cheap pricing is that it doesn't include nigiri, but I personally LOVE ordering a bunch of rolls. I must say, I am guilty of judging a place based on how much bang you get for your buck, and here you get a long of BANG! 

Every time I come, I always start with a couple appetizers (poke and baked green mussels a must), and work my way through several orders of rolls. I pretty much stuff myself until I'm at the point of disgust, then safety order dessert--which is usually a bowl of coffee ice cream or strawberry mochi. YUM-O!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for AYCE! Many options to choose from and the service was okay wish she came up to us more often then she did.  

I ordered Uni.  Uni has to have a specific taste and freshness.
They brought the ui out to me, and it was DRY and HARD.
Uni has to be soft.

Everything else was good though, some things could of been better."}
{"text":"Ok, so I go in to pick up the order I called in and the front desk woman told me to have a seat and wait, so I did.  Then I notice a gentleman enter and by the way he greeted the staff, I could tell he was a regular.  The sushi chef asked him what he could make him and the guy gives him his order which he prompt,y received while I was still waiting for my order I had called in 30 minutes ago.  I asked the sushi chef how much longer for my order because I was already pressed for time.  He ROLLS his eyes at me, then starts speaking Japanese to the hostess, they both laugh, and he shouts at me in English:  \"20 minutes!\"  I then asked why this gentleman who arrived AFTER me got his order before mine and the sushi chef just shrugged his shoulders.  I finally got my order and left, HOWEVER....when I got home and opened my order of spicy tuna rolls, I realized that the jerk of a sushi chef had the gall to put WASABI instead of cucumber in each sushi roll!!!  Never, EVER going there again!  I'm lucky he didn't spit in my food and I only know he didn't because I was sitting there watching him make my order!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever! I would give 0 stars if it was an option we went in with just over an hour before closing The lady was so rude and rushed us the entire time asked to sit at the bar and she said no because They just  cleaned it! Regardless they would have to clean wherever we sat we weren't ordering fast enough apparently and this even worse lady came from the back to rush us as well for our order we ordered 3 rolls for two of us we were in and out in 30 minutes she didn't need to be so rude I won't ever be going back which is unfortunate because it's so close to my house"}
{"text":"I was really excited to get AYCE sushi, I was not impressed that they didn't put how many pieces per roll so when the bill came and they tried to charge me a \"left over fee\" I couldn't help but feel cheated. It does state \"left overs are extra charge\" but who are they determine my left over ratio? Alas, I wasn't charged extra and they even didn't charge me for my Sale either. 
 Also we couldn't get the servers to go away to take our order and then we couldn't get them to come back for our check or to order anything else.

Food: 3 stars
Menu: 2 stars
Staff: 2 stars

Return: nah sushi places are a dime a dozen here."}
{"text":"This place is by my house and I have went three times by myself and sat at the sushi bar.  I like it.  The sushi is good, I ordered a screaming o today and a soft shell crab roll.  The screaming o was yummy, the roll was spicy but that was noted in the menu.  The service is always great too.  I really like this place"}
{"text":"Nice place, clean, good service, they have a good options for rolls but way to big for one order 6pces but still to much rice, I like sushi and $26.95 pp ayce I don't think it's worthed for rice. They have really good sushi and I will definitely be back when I heard they make it smaller and less rice, ty"}
{"text":"Only $20 bucks for all you can eat plus appetizers. Seriously my favorite place and some of the best sushi for all you can eat. Sure you can go to the Strip and drop 3x as much for fancy sushi. But their menu is diverse and the appetizers are delicious! I come here all the time and the sushi chefs are fun to talk to. 
The only downfall is if you leave anything unfinished they charge you and they keep a sharp eye on you too. Lol"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this sushi joint and I will most defiantly be back. The waitress (forgot her name) was supper nice and was there every time we needed something. Amazing sushi, great atmosphere definetly recommend"}
{"text":"My family and I will never go here again! They have the worst service I've ever experienced anywhere!  We never received some of the items we ordered. They never offered to refill drinks. We had to flag down the waitress to order. The food we did receive took forever to come. We were there for over 2 agonizing hours waiting and waiting. My sons were still hungry when we left, but enough was enough. This was the only time in my life that I didn't leave a tip. It's a shame because the food is really good, but the service ruins the whole experience!"}
{"text":"The items are always fresh tasting and delicious. Sure, they do not have an AYCE option here but the taste, friendliness of all employees, attentiveness to filling our orders and refilling our drinks, and the location (close proximity to our house) makes for a nice treat. 

We have tried rolls, chicken bento boxes, and of course, the japanese beers. We've always sat at the sushi bar and have always had a place to sit immediately upon arrival.

Have done lunch and dinner and they have never disappointed."}
{"text":"This place had a nice set up with booths different from other sushi places. I would recommend more pictures on the menu to give images to sushi names. But overall, this was a great place for sushi. The service we received was decent."}
{"text":"This is my go to AYCE sushi. Love it here. They advertise for a cheaper than \"normal\" price, but if you want nigiri, it's an additional $5 so it costs about the same as everyone else. 

If they are busy, expect a long wait  

Some of my top favs are: pearl special, star bucks, final destination, and spider roll."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant is sub par.  The rice in the sushi is not fresh.  I recommend sushi loca or sushi fever."}
{"text":"I don't usually leave reviews and when I do it's usually a good one. But this was the worst service ever. We waited an hour and a half for the first fish of sushi. Then we were getting the wrong orders. We were so hungry we started to eat the food they brought us even if we didn't order it. After that they forgot our orders and we had to reorder. If that wasn't bad enough the food started coming out half cooked and tasting really bad. At that point, we were to upset to eat. I have never ate angry but it happened today. It started bad and snowballed into worst ever. Not coming back. I suggest you don't either. Save yourself and go to Yama Sushi instead!"}
{"text":"Very nice inside decor.  Staff was friendly and the sushi roll called \"Tastes Like My Ex-Girlfriend\" was an explosion of flavor in my mouth...spicy, cool, crunch - delicious."}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm a little torn on this place.  Its in a great area close to the  95, and its convenience is what drives me here.

One thing I want to mention is they have a lunch punch card: buy 10 get one free.  This may be of note to those who frequent it regularly (its on the back of their business card).

I've had their sushi lunch special a few times, and its hit or miss for me.  You get five pieces of nigiri and a spicy tuna roll for 12.95 along with a miso soup, and I think a small salad too.   There were a few times that some of the nigiri had a weird taste to it, like the way bread tastes when you store it next to bananas (if that makes sense).  Also the fish somehow didn't seem as fresh as it should have been.  It wasn't bad, and I didn't get sick, and I didn' t think it was inexcusably horrible, but I thought I could get better for the price (Tata bistro is in the area as well)."}
{"text":"I normally don't go back to a restaurant once I have had a bad experience, but I have to admit I gave The Sushi several chances. This place is near us and there are not many Japanese places nearby. My wife and I initially went in to eat lunch here on one occasion and the food took 30 minutes to arrive, they brought the wrong appetizer and when we told them we had to leave an needed the check, they took another 15 minutes to bring the check. 

I decided that this could have been just one bad day or whatever and since there aren't many Japanese restaurants nearby and I love the food, we continued to order from them. On another occasion they did not provide part of the bento box we ordered. However, on the most recent occasion, which is the last time I patronize this business, they were incredibly rude to me. My wife ordered two bento boxes which come with salads. The salads were not included and she did not realize this until she got home. She called right away and was told to come pick up the salads. She had a cold at the time and did not want to drive back out to get them. She explained this and the woman helping her named \"Mia\" hung up on her. I decided to call back and was given several excuses about how she was new and did not know the salad came from the kitchen etc. I asked her for a refund on our credit card and she offered a $2 credit! Literally $2 off for the inconvenience. I was not satisfied and asked for a manager, she then stated in a frustrated tone \"oh my god!\" and hung up on me! I called back and asked her why she hung up on me, she did not answer me but said her manager was there. I spoke to a manager by the name of Scott and informed him of how rude she was and that we would NEVER be coming back to their business. He apologized but did not offer anything to make the situation better.

In closing, if you want to eat at a place that takes 30 minutes to serve food, frequently forgets items from your meal, hangs up on you when you want to complain and provides overall bad customer service......this is the place for you I guess."}
{"text":"No specials that they tell you about, but they do exist. Waiter was awful, catty and slow. Over priced, ingredients are not what they say (don't order the shitake mushroom miso soup). Dirty tables. They don't give you a pot of tea when you ask, only cups of. Had to ask for stronger tea because it tasted like hot water. Just awful."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favorite sushi restaurants. I'm not too sure what's happen since our last visit but to wait over 1.5hrs for our order to come is ridiculous. As we sat waiting for our food, we noticed that a party that was sat after us received their orders before us. When we asked where our food us, we were met with the lame excuse that there's too many people in the restaurant and they can't keep up.

Come on now there is absolutely no reason to wait over 1.5hrs for our food. We got to the point that any food delivered to our table regardless of if we ordered it or not we'd take and eat because the service was HORRIBLE.

Take your chances but to be honest we will never be coming here again!"}
{"text":"the food was great but they have really horrible customer service...took us about 30-45min just to get a drink refill and order another plate."}
{"text":"I love sushi. I love a lot of food but sushi is probably my overall favorite. This place is very good. I can't find any fault with it. The service was fast and friendly, and you know how rare that is at AYCEs. I informed her this was my first time there and she did an excellent job keeping us with food to eat. There was never a moment when I was waiting for something. The fish was fresh, the rolls were tasty, and they came very fast. Thus is a good AYCE sushi place."}
{"text":"Salmon and tuna sashimi were great.  Cucumber salad was awful- strong taste of vinegar.  Vegetable tempura was awful- no flavor and under cooked.  Our table was  dirty and sticky- we had to ask twice for the waitress to clean it- she tried setting our food on the table before she cleaned it.  Service was slow- took 20 minutes to get a plate of sashimi- the restaurant was not busy.  Would not return to eat here nor would I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything bad to say.  I've been here probably 10 times and it is fabulous every time.  The Pearl Special,  and the Japanese lasagna are to die for!"}
{"text":"Totally over priced! I got chicken fried rice 8$ and shrimp fried rice so SAD!!.very little amount.its rice for god sake and bearly any chicken too. Same with other 10$ very little shrimp and the tiny ones too.never seen that.that white square box should of been full! It wasnt even half!! RIP OFF."}
{"text":"Went in at 930 for a late dinner since they close at 1030. They wouldn't seat me telling me they're closed. I call that being lazy and it's definitely going to be affecting your business."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years and it didn't take long to recall why. 
Service is slow 
Roles are bland
Sushi so-so

Guess nothing improves. Oh well"}
{"text":"The food was really good here, but the service was extremely slow! It took us about 10-15 mins for someone to get our order and our check."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my family and ordered their bento lunch boxes. Very good quality bento box and lunch selection. The portions were of good size. The value here is good for lunch. Their sushi roll menu is quite diverse. They do not offer AYCE which is a reason I chose to eat at this place (higher quality fish).

Dishes I ordered:
Super white tuna sashimi - 3 good size pieces. Not as tender or flavorful as other places I have been to. Decent fish quality, though.

Tempura and terriyaki beef bento box - typical bento box. No complaints. Very satisfied.

Spicy tuna roll with tuna on top (raw fish roll) - I really liked their ponzu sauce that they used. It was not over bearing and complimented the tuna nicely.

California roll with avocado and white sauce on top ( I forget the name) - standard roll. Tastes as described. Not a huge fan of mayo based sauce.

Of the many sushi restaurants that I have been to, this one if definitely one of the better ones (fish quality is better than goyemon, i love sushi, blue fin sushi, and most other AYCE places in vegas). I would come back here to try some of their other rolls."}
{"text":"This was the first Sushi place I came to in 2012 when I moved to Vegas and just happen to live down the street.  It is amazing.  They have the best menu selection for all you can eat and they are priced very well.  Dinner is $20 and Lunch is $17.  On top of all the rolls they offer (more for dinner) they have a great selection of appetizers also.  You gotta try 2 things when you go there.  On the appetizer menu try the baked muscles, they are awesome! On the roll menu try their lasagna roll, you wont regret it.  The reason I am giving it 4 stars is because my last trip (which was tonight) was just eh... Don't get the Tiger roll, not that great.  All in all you won't regret it though, it's a great place to try."}
{"text":"The service is terrible as well as the quality of the food. The food isn't bad but it definitely doesn't make the price feel like it's worth it. The staff messed up my order AND before I even got it they almost gave it away to somebody else. Going here was such a waste of time, money, and an appetite."}
{"text":"We come here at least 3-4 times a month. The Megabucks roll, Screaming\"O\", Maguro, Ika, everything here is fantastic. I was stationed in Japan for 4 years, this is my favorite sushi place EVER!!!!! My 20 month old son has even learned to use chop sticks here. Family friendly, great staff, great food, great pricing. It doesn't get much better than this. Bonus for us, it's only 1 mile from the house. I would go every day if my wife would let me. I'm actually drooling while thinking about eating here again tomorrow. We love The Sushi!"}
{"text":"Just left AYCE sushi still hungry for the first time EVER. It took over 45 minutes to get all the rolls we ordered (7 rolls total) and there were only 5 other occupied tables, 3 sushi chefs and 3 servers. We could hear the waitress and sushi chefs arguing about whether they'd already made our rolls or not. 

The food was only ok. The rolls with tempura shrimp were especially bland. All you could taste was tempura batter. 

We were never offered refills on our drinks the whole time we were there. When they brought our change, it was short by $5.00. Never going back here again."}
{"text":"I gave a gift certificat to The Sushi to a friend and he loved it.  He was raving about how good the food is.

FYI - restaurant.com has $25 gift certificates for $10 and if you get them on sale for only $2."}
{"text":"The best AYCE sushi spot in Summerlin! I usually stay away from AYCE sushi bars as the rolls are generally that that great and small. However, the rolls Here are great and my favorite is the Pearl Special. We were there on a Friday night and were greeted by nearly everyone working with a loud welcome in Japanese  when walking in and seated immediately. Orders were taken within a few minutes and we had 3 of our rolls within 10 minutes of sitting down. After reading some of the negative reviews regarding service I was concerned but my experience couldn't have been better."}
{"text":"The Sushi has become my favorite sushi place in Vegas. 
There was once I time where the food and service was terrible. After giving it another chance I was pleasantly surprised. I've been here every week for about 4 months now and have only had funky fish once. In the world of raw fish you have to allow room for error in my opinion. 
The staff is fantastic with one person in particular being the sweetest person ever. Ask for Nuri ;)  The chefs are meticulous producing consistent quality every time. 
If you are in the mood to try something unique and fantastic, I recommend trying THE GRAND CANYON. The description doesn't sound great but it is an explosion of awesomeness in your mouth. Yum. 
I give The Sushi a 4 of 5 on cleanliness but that's only because I notice baseboard and weird details. 
Overall this place is a perfect sushi spot, especially if you catch it while they are still offering 50% off specialty rolls. You can't beat it!"}
{"text":"The food was very fresh. The staff was gracious. Our waiter was genuine and did his job well. 

Only complaint was the sushi was a tad skimpy and a discount for my check in would have been nice. But not all restaurants do it anyway. However, that would have been a bonus for me."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the summer time to enjoy the great specials they have for AYCE . Sushi was delish with great prices ... Now that they are under new ownership I will not be returning . We came here tonight to eat with family and the service was terrible . The food was still delish but the AYCE menu was less - which is okay . The real problem was the horrible customer service from the beginning . I have never experienced such crappy service in my life anywhere else ... 
From the beginning they took forever to come take our order , then when the girl came she was acting flustered and like it was so hard to write on the tally sheet what we wanted . She had to go back to the bar and took 10 min to ask a question . Once our order was finally put in we waited more time . Finally our food started coming out but a lot of the appetizers (baked mussels, sushi pieces , salads) never came . When we addressed this issue we were told it was coming - it never came ! Then complaining again about a lasagna roll and hand roll not coming out they told us that it was cancelled ...we didn't cancel anything ! We argued at least for the avocado hand roll and were told the hour was up and we could only get dessert ... Mind you they count the hour from when the order is placed ... And they take forever to start and give it to the table. We asked for soy sauce and spicy mayo for the table and the owner herself told us that there was enough sauce on the sushi ... When my cousin started to ask the waitress for something she said one minute rudely and never returned ... Just horrible overall . There are so many sushi places in Vegas . I'm sure this one will fail ."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place stop and have sushi, came across this place and was not disappointed. Had all you can eat and every roll was perfect, shrimp lovers in particular. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Last call at 10'when they close at 11 smh stupid therefore we won't be going here anymore just 5 miles and your on Sunset and Stephanie where you have more choices"}
{"text":"I loved this place. The rolls are huge and its not all rice. Prices are comparable to other sushi places but the portions here are well worth the price. Food was fresh and service was spot on!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I have not had a roll that I didn't love.  I've tried most places for sushi in Henderson, and this is the best one I've found.  

I recommend the Pearl Special Roll and the Playboy Roll.  Both are fantastic.  

I seriously can't think of one negative about this place, I am making it my regular sushi place."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in the service here tonight. I have been once before, service was slow and inattentive - I figured it might be a fluke and decided to give it another shot. Unfortunately, it was even worse this evening. We waited about 15 minutes after sitting down to even be acknowledged, then the server sort of apologized and rushed off again. Eventually we placed our order and food started arriving, but one of our orders of nigiri never came - but the server also never returned so we weren't able to ask about it. The girl who was at the host stand came over to ask how everything was and I told her about my frustration and the missing order of food, and she said \"oh...I'm sorry.\" No offer to make things right in any way. I'm a server myself and am generally very patient - I know serving can get hectic and sometimes things go wrong in the kitchen, but I would have really appreciated an effort to make things better after this crappy experience. We paid the bill and I had to stand up as though I was going to leave before someone came over to bring us change. I will not be returning. The worst part was that the sushi chefs at the bar seemed friendly and the nigiri I did was receive was fresh and delicious - but it wasn't worth the frustration we went through to get it."}
{"text":"Mega bucks, Taste Like My ex Girlfriend are some of my favorite rolls here. I love their all you can eat option!! But if that's not something you want to do they have a la carte option. I have been here for lunch too. Great bento boxes. MUST TRY FOR YOUR SELF!!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with The Sushi. My favorite was the Strip Salmon. It was amazing. Everything was fresh and the staff was very friendly. I would highly recommend this place to all sushi lovers. I will be back on Monday for more..."}
{"text":"High quality sushi! You get what you pay for. Lots of amazing special rolls with great flavors!"}
{"text":"Went here for the AYCE 12.99 sushi lunch special. 
The special is for rolls only, of which they have about 20 to select from, so you're going to find something you'll want to eat. Nigri is 50cents a piece, appetizers are 75 cents to 2 bucks. So it's SERIOUSLY cheap. Service was fine, if a little slow. My rolls were fresh and tasty. The only complaint I have about the food is that they use enough rice in one roll to feed an orphanage for a MONTH. Seriously, WAY too much rice. However, considering the price, it's something you kind of expect, so it deosn't detract much. 
If you aren't ready for AYCE, they also have cheap bento boxes and some sushi combos. GREAT lunch specials. 
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend and two of our friends on a Friday evening. When we first walked in, it was quite dead and we were one of the only customers. No big deal, we figured we beat the Friday evening rush (it got packed later on).

When we were at our table, it seemed like the waitresses were really eager to take our orders. In fact, too eager to the point where I thought they were trying to get us out of there quick. We got AYCE and began ordering. Also, the price for AYCE is something like $21 EXCLUDING the nigiri. If you want nigiri you have to pay an extra $5/person. I think it's a great tactic to bring in customers with the $21 AYCE price, but it's also kind of unpleasantly surprising when you find out nigiri isn't included. No biggie though bc most sushi places are $26-28 for AYCE including Nigiri so it balances out haha.

All of the fish tasted fresh and all the rolls we had were great. I can't really remember the names but there was a lot of variety. I also enjoyed the screaming O salad, but felt that it was a little drenched in sauce. Overall the food was great!

The reason why I took 1 star off was because of the service. Whenever we told the waitress that we were still deciding, she kinda looked annoyed and pretty much ignored us thereafter. We had to flag a different waitress down when we were ready (nearly 30 minutes after the original waitress ditched us). I think the waitresses can be a bit more attentive and less annoyed if we aren't ready to order.

Overall I think this place is pretty good. I'm still loyal to sushi koma, but will probably try this place again."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Nice atmosphere! Pricing is decent as well. I dine here often and is still one of my favorite places. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I crave this place all the time. I've been to other sushi places around the valley and this is my favorite by far. The Megabucks is my Fav. You can't go wrong here. Nice first date spot if you plan an evening date. Cozy, comfortable atmosphere and knowledgeable very nice waitstaff. Go..now!"}
{"text":"Updated review is in order, so here goes. They are a refreshing sushi spot in Henderson, kind of on the outskirts off the 95 south and horizon ridge.
The sushi quality is excellent, the customer service is decent, not super great, but ok. I say this because we come in as a party of 4, not really busy since it's kind of a early dinner at 6:30PM.
You get the traditional \"mushy mushy\" or whatever it is they say when patrons arrive in the majority of sushi restaurants. Then the lady behind the desk and the single waitress continue with their conversation and leave us standing around until they finish whatever it is they are discussing, like come on seat the people first, then finish up whatever they are talking about. -1
There is no all you can eat here and with just the 2 sushi men behind the bar, it just will not work. My previous review explains the situation when they are busy, but even our latest visit with just a few on the sushi bar and just our party of 4 on a table occupying the entire restaurant they still have a problem with timing. Here is the second and probably the biggest second -1 for their Yelp rating.
We order our drinks, look at the menu and order our food choices.
10 minutes later...
1. My wife gets here sushi roll.
2, 5 minutes later I get my sushi roll.
3. 3 minutes later my Mom gets her roll.
4. 5 more minutes later, my Dad gets his roll.
The rolls are nice and well made tastes great and not too much sauce to destroy the sushi flavors, but the timing is just way off. Diner 1 gets served and then diner 4 gets served nearly 20 minutes later?
Sure if they are busy it's understandable, but the busy meter read on the low side, almost a 1 or 2 on the busy scale. I am sure they would be in the weeds if they place gets busy and often they are as it was on our last visit one weekend. Good food, ok service, but the timing is really poor and can be an issue. The restaurant is a decent size and surely they have been doing well for quite sometime now, but maybe take a little hit on the payroll and get a third guy behind the counter and take care of business the proper way so patrons don't have to watch others in their party eat for a long time until they finally get their order.
We would come back way more often if they would correct this flaw in their customer service. HIre another sushi chef, maybe offer \"all you can eat\"? They have the quality and technique down, just kick it up a notch."}
{"text":"This is one of the better sushi places in Henderson. Their cucumber salad is really good. I seriously recommend the garlic tuna sashimi."}
{"text":"Very tasty.... Read the review... Service was excellent....very affordable... Definetely would recommend !!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite local AYCE sushi place! It's five minutes from the house and is smack-dab in the heart of suburbia without being out of touch with trends or expectations.  The atmosphere is always welcoming and casual, excellent for lunch but also nice enough for a relaxed date.  They used to play a lot of 90s pop but they've recently switched it to JPop. Honestly, if I'm there with someone I'm not really listening to the music and if I'm alone I wear headphones, so the music doesn't really make a difference to me. I've been going here for about two years now and they always stay delightfully consistent.  
Pros: 
the fish is a great quality for price point and location 
consistent 
good price, pretty much everything is on the AYCE 

Cons: 
The menu should be more detailed (the cucumber salad specifically comes with a sweet, creamy dressing that I was neither expecting nor cared for)  
Nigiri, apps, etc are all great but the rolls are unimaginative and almost all have some kind of fried or tempura component. 
 Service can be inconsistent and gets slow if it's busy at all. Also, if you can, sit at a table and not the bar; the service will be better and slightly faster."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Everyone seemed to love \"Tastes Like My Ex-girlfriend\" and it did not disappoint. My wife, who I've been introducing to sushi over the past year, said that it was the best sushi she has ever had and could eat it once a week. Tempura was good. Udon noodles were okay. Will be coming back for the sushi many more times."}
{"text":"The service felt very rushed, it could be because she was the only server. Other then that this place has been the best place I've been to since living in Las Vegas for sashimi, it was absolutely wonderful. Coming from Hawaii we are so picky with our sashimi, been to many many different restaurants and this has been the best so far. The chefs specials were not special or that good to us. The hand California roll & sashimi would be the only items I'd return for. Screaming O was horrible as well as my ex girlfriend or whatever it was called, the pearl wasn't so good as well."}
{"text":"We continue and continue to hope this is going to get better. The service is slow and it is always 2 hours. Tonight we ordered and our food was 40 minutes late. They offered limp shrimp tempora. Still coming one by one slowly. 
Once the food came out we ordered more because the first order was so slow. Not at an hour now our food came out wreaking of metal/plastic. They tried to say it could have been the crunch from the kitchen. 
We just wanted out they tried to say oh atleast wait for the rest to come we declined because if this roll comes out smelling and tasting like metal/plastic why would we all want to continue to eat?
They delayed bringing the check. Than atleast only charged us for 2 all you can eat orders. They tried to explain that this isnt normal blamed the chef. We said no this time seems to be the norm as the last few times we are stuck there due to either slow service or slow cooks. She just kept trying to explain. Be weary!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and though service was great, food was not.

Both Earl and I got the sashimi lunch special which comes with 6 slices of assorted sashimi, a choice of spicy salmon, yellowtail, or tuna roll, soup and salad ($12.95 each)

-The 6 slices of sashimi: thinly sliced and poorly cut.  Doesn't even look and taste like sashimi grade.
-Earl got the spicy salmon and I got the spicy yellowtail roll.  Both rolls taste the same, except for the rice that covered the rolls.  Why? Because the rice that covered the spicy salmon tasted SPOILED!  It was Earl's pick so he didn't want to escalate the issue.  I would have.
-Soup: standard miso soup
-Salad: at least there were no wilted iceberg lettuce.

Needless to say, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"The Japanese lasagna here is one of the best I've ever tried :)) It can be pretty pricey especially since it isn't AYCE but if you're up to spend for quality sushi then come to this place !! 

Everything was amazing! The nigiris were fresh and yummy, along with all the rolls ! It comes in pretty big portions as well so good for sharing ! :))"}
{"text":"I really love food and all rolls here. Lasagna roll is amazing. Also there's good prices. But the service here is very bad. Rude waitress, who always want to cheat us and take an extra money. It's really big minus for this place."}
{"text":"This place used to be good but after some people left service has gone down hill. Sat there for 8 minutes and was not even acknowledged so we left. It's very sad to see this place go down hill that I have enjoyed in the past."}
{"text":"The food was okay but my experience was ruined by the employees. My waitress took forever to take our order and I would often catch her just sitting on her phone doing absolutely nothing and not even care to check up on my table."}
{"text":"Well, here goes. Its really funny how one person with a major attitude can ruin a place you love. This was our third visit and probably our last. We had the misfortune of having Justin as our sushi chef at the bar. This guy has a major bad attitude. He acts like you are bothering him if you order! The roll he made for my wife just fell apart, he completely forgot one of my orders and when i asked for the heads on my sweet shrimp he just said \"No. Too late\". What the hell kind of customer service is this guy trained in? It has made a great sushi bar turn into the worst experience! There are so many choices around that restaurants do not need their customers to be treated this way. If \"the sushi\" does not correct this rude behavior then everyone will go across the street to Naka Sushi.  A sushi bar where you feel welcome!"}
{"text":"All i have to say, is yummm!  Had my usual tempura appetizer & an order of chirashi, yumm-o!  They never cease to amaze me!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Sushi place!! The staff is super friendly, they remember their regulars and the sushi is delicious!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to live in the area and visit here all time. We made sure when we came back to visit we stopped by especially to enjoy their chirashi (which is our favorite). This place has yet to disappoint."}
{"text":"The rice was undercooked. It's sad, so sad, too, because their rolls were a little bit more creative and unique than other places that simply mimic I Love Sushi. I'll have to go back because maybe the crunchy rice was a fluke but, still, it's been a long time since a sushi restaurant served me bad rice.

I suggest the Playboy, which you can see in my photos. It has spicy tempura shrimp on the inside with a little yum, yum sauce, salmon and avocado on the outside.

The spicy roll also shown in one of my photos was really tasty, if it weren't for the texture of the rice.

The cherry blossom tree painted on the back wall is really cool. Service was pretty good, not great. I'll return to The Sushi because their sauces and rolls had good flavor. The rice problem should be short lived."}
{"text":"From Start to finish:

My husband and I were looking for a place nearby that was open for lunch. We both love sushi and we were in the area, so this place was an obvious choice. We were on motorcycles so we had our gear that we had to carry in. Upon entering we were instructed to sit at a small table for two by the sushi chef behind the bar. Right as we sat down, a waitress offered us a larger table for us to put our helmets on the extra chairs. This was nice.

Once we sat down, the waitress asked us what we wanted to drink. In the middle of us speaking she walked away to deliver another table their food. We thought it was rather odd, but kind of laughed it off. She came back a few minutes later and then got our drink order. 

After that, we attempted to order a sushi lunch special. The lunch special had nigiri and a roll of your choice. A previous yelper took a picture of a beautiful selection of fish (not shell fish). My husband is severely allergic to shellfish so he asked is there happened to be any with the sushi special. Contrary to the picture, the serve shrimp nigiri according to the waitress. We told her about his allergies and she said that she could not alter the menu due to the cheap price. She pretty much insisted shrimp had to be a part of the plate. The lunch special was a soup, salad, 6 piece of unknown nigiri, and a regular roll. Since we could not leave shrimp off the plate, we had to look at the menu again. My first thought was that the shrimp nigiri is the same price on the menu as most of the nigiri and depending on the kind it could be the most expensive. The lunch special should state what type of nigiri comes with it, because then we had to take more time looking at the menu.


Eventually we got two rolls, one called Monica and the other was called Fat Ass.

These were good rolls, but I do not think I would come back. I spent about 40 bucks for two rolls, a beer, and a sprite. According to yelp it's great, but for me it's just so so. The service needs to be a bit better."}
{"text":"Everything is great except for service.
Seeeeeems like you will get ignored more and more the longer you stay for AYCE.
I don't know if this is a tradition at AYCE sushi places, but this time it seemed quite obvious that they no longer wanted to take our orders.
Everything tastes very good, when you get it though."}
{"text":"Sushi tastes great.  Service is good.  The reason for the four stars is because every time I call to order takeout.  They tell me to come in 10 minutes but don't actually start preparing the sushi till I get there so I always have to wait which is bad especially when I'm in a hurry."}
{"text":"who's your daddy?!...  
   Love love!... the sushi
Tried every where else, nothing comes close to this place....
Food is awesome!..."}
{"text":"Wow. After our 2nd time eating at The Sushi this evening, our tastebuds were blown away..again. Tonight, we sat at the Sushi Bar, and ordered a DELICIOUS Grand Canyon Roll...man was that good. Get it. You wont regret it ;) Our waiter was nice and polite, although he did ask us as soon as we sat down what we wanted to drink...we had not even had a chance to glance at the menu. 
Overall great place. I would recommend it to a friend. The rolls were very well worth the average $7-$13 per roll price."}
{"text":"Like another reviewer we live very close by so my wife and I thought we'd give them a shot. I came in on a Saturday with my wife during lunch hour. They had maybe 3 tables occupied. We were sat down slowly. It took 15 minutes before the waitress came by and took our order.
The appetizer, fried calamari took 30 minutes more to come out and when it came out there was barely any calamari. We both ordered katsu lunch bentos with additional rolls. The rolls came out maybe 15 minutes after the appetizer did. And the boxes came out about 5 minutes after that.

The katsu came out slightly burnt and was very salty. The rolls were the only thing we enjoyed but I would not go through that again. We were there for more than an hour for underwhelming food and slow service.

Minus stars for slow service, price and subpar burnt food.

Bottom line: never going there again."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Texas and looking for a great sushi place. Saw this one had good reviews and gave it a shot. We were not disappointed! Great special on all you can eat sushi and it tasted fantastic!"}
{"text":"We always have good service at The Sushi. The food has always been fresh and tastes wonderful!. My personal favorite is the dynamite roll. My wife loves the saki and rainbow rolls. You have to give this place a try."}
{"text":"I love sushi so I set out to find the best! This place is so good and makes some of the best sushi I've had. I love sitting at the sushi bar and watching them make it. They use fresh ingredients and fish. The staff is AMAZING and really goes the extra mile for giving great customer service."}
{"text":"Made it in on a Sunday around 4:30pm nice before dinner crowd starts filing in. Service was great. No wait time. Sushi was awesome. Everything was fresh and delicious.  make it a sushi stop. You will not be disappointed. Has sushi bar, and booth seating. Keep an eye out or you'll miss it on the south side of lake mead."}
{"text":"Always good when I come here. Haven't been in a while. Was there last weekend for the AYCE dinner. Great chance to try new things and share with my date. Will be coming back more often. Been under new management I think since my last visit (a few years ago)."}
{"text":"So YUMMY!!!  The service and food is awesome!  Our neighbors told us how great this place was, and that there were good options without raw fish that I can eat while pregnant.  I ordered the Golden California and Creamy Cruch Roll... I'm not a fan of cream cheese in a roll, but the Creamy Crunch Roll was my favorite.  My husband and I also orders the spicy garlic edemame and these fried balls of AEESOME from the appetizer menu.  Everyone was so nice, and they even brought me out a treat for my birthday.  We will definitely become REGULARS, and recommend this place for everyone... even people like my husband, who don't even like sushi ;)"}
{"text":"From what I ordered I was satisfied with quality and taste. I didn't do AYCE because my friend never orders it so I ordered some of their house specials and it filled me up.  Service was good too since we did not order the AYCE, I seen most of the complaints about this joint when they do AYCE.  Overall a 3 star for now until I see how its like during AYCE."}
{"text":"I really don't know where to begin, I wish I could give this place 0 stars because that is what they deserve. The service I received here tonight was absolutely horrible and disgustingly unprofessional. My family and I decided to do AYCE (it was 7 of us). The waiter comes to our table to tell us to write our order down on a piece of paper, we kindly tell her that we know what we want and if she can just take the order. She writes down our order and gives us attitude because it's a big order, but it's 7 of us doing AYCE. Anyways, 3 of the same rolls come out, but we only ordered two, so we kindly tell her that we ordered only two and she visibly gets upset and tells us that we are wrong. She gets her paper where she wrote the order to show us; we feel bad so we just take the roll. The owner (she told us she was the owner) comes to our table shortly after to tell us we have to eat everything or she will charge us. When we asked for spicy mayo on the side she said that the rolls already have sauces on them. As we eat, my cousin tries to ask a waitress for a refill on his tea, but she says \"hold on\" and walks away never to return. Our waitress never returns for the rest of the meal. After about half an hour passes, we notice that half of what we ordered didn't come out so we ask the owner and she says that our hour long of AYCE time is up and that we cannot eat anymore and if we want dessert. We tell her that we are still waiting on food and she says we are wrong. We tell her to look at the paper in which our waitress wrote the order, AND BEHOLD, HALF OUR ORDER NEVER CAME. She tells us that we past our hour and we cannot eat more. We literally sit there and argue with her but it's going no where. When she brings the bill, we end up splitting the bill four ways. After about 15 min of them not returning, we ask about the payment and turns out they charged the wrong amount on the cards. It takes them 30 min to do the voids and charge our cards again. 



This experience was so ridiculous and horrible. I wasn't even full when I left and I will never come back here again. What a shame!!!"}
{"text":"The is my favorite sushi spot. Quick and great quality. Highly recommend. I just wish they would do all you can eat.,."}
{"text":"Being a Las Vegas native and an avid sushi lover, I have seen and experienced my fair share of sushi restaurants around town. I have to say that overall this is one of my top five! 

My man and I went in for a late night sushi craving and decided to try out this new local joint down the street. When we came in it was \"last call\", meaning order everything you want all at once so they can start shutting down the restaurant. Luckily we already knew what we wanted to order. 

2 orders - Tuna Nigiri 
2 orders - Salmon Nigiri 
2 orders - Halibut Nigiri 
Chef's Special Roll (Leftover Roll) 
1 order - Tall Hot Sake 
1 order - Large Asahi Beer 

Came out to almost $30 per person. Although this is a little pricey, it was all worth it! The fish was fresh and the cuts were perfect. The special roll that the sushi chef \"BJ\" made was amazing. It had soft shell crab, tuna and a spicy ponzu sauce. I would recommend having the chefs make you their own special rolls. It gives them a chance to show you what they've really got! 

The ambiance was very nice. The use of dark red and black throughout the interior really makes it feel warm and inviting. The Sushi has a hip and social feel to it without being pretentious. And as for friendly service, they were awesome! The chef \"BJ\" kept charming me and my boyfriend. So whether he was working to get a big tip or just having fun, who cares, it was hilarious! It was such a nice time and I definitely plan on going back again sometime soon!

{"text":"Nice clean place, good atmosphere. Server was friendly. AYCE option $17.99 lunch/$20.99 dinner. AYCE selection good. Food was yummy. I'm pretty picky where I eat sushi nowadays, from being experimental I've had my share of food poisoning, this place exceeded my expectations. No complaints from server from our questions, explaining things well, and a first time sushi guest I brought with me. Only slight flaw was that she didn't know what flavored sakes were available and made no offer to check for us when we surely were going to increase their revenue by ordering some. Otherwise this place holds high marks in my book. I will revisit it soon."}
{"text":"This place is the best!!  If you haven't been here you need to go at least once, and then you'll be hooked!  The pearl special is my favorite!  Best sushi in henderson ;)."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a shot because I was craving sushi and too lazy to drive to I love sushi. Boy was I happily surprised. The quality of the fish was wonderful. The roll choices were all creative. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"YUM! I think we've definitely found our new favorite sushi joint here in Vegas! 

They have a great variety to choose from - I highly recommend the Spider roll - it will bring great happiness to your tastebuds! The ninja roll was crazy spicy with oniony flavor and the yum yum was a classic deliciousness. 

I wish they would do combination meals - and they could definitely secure our weekly patronage if they would incorporate a $1 or penny sake night :D"}
{"text":"Yummy sushi, great service. This little place is perfect when you have sushi craving. It's close to home and their sushi is good. We're been here a few times and they're good for a quick bite to eat. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Sushi is great and service is fast! Comfortable seating with deep booths for fitting large parties."}
{"text":"I've been here a lot and I'll continue to go here. I haven't had any problems with service, they have always been very nice and prompt when taking my order and the food is good. It's nice having a sushi place so close."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, always with my son,  never had the best service.  Food takes forever, servers are rude and not eager to serve.  The food has always been delicious but my last straw was when I ordered AUCE and ordered a hand roll for my 23 month old son because he can eat the filling without choking on the seaweed.  Children 2 and younger are supposed to eat free, first, she tried to charge the AUCE child price and then when I told her he was under two she still charged me $5 for his hand roll that should have been included under my AUCE.  I will find a new place that my son can eat free at, he barely finishes a roll right now."}
{"text":"Sushi is good don't get me wrong. The wait for your sushi is 10+ minutes and gets longer each time you order. After the first time you order, the waitress barely comes back to check on you to place more orders. My poor friend I was with never got any of her rolls until we reminded them about them. Only my rolls came. Good quality food for sure. Service kind of sucks."}
{"text":"The staff did alot of staring and speaking in Japanese. It was a uncomfortable feeling. Also they are a bit more in price and do not offer soup and salad with your take out meal as other places do."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, super friendly , fresh food , were coming here 4 times a week!!
Great place, quiet, good ambiance"}
{"text":"I like the names of the sushi at this place. You can just yell it out to the chef when you sit at the bar. Yes, I will take the big ass slut please.. Plus, the sushi is fresh and they will change whatever you want and add stuff to it. I like to add green onion to lots of sushi.. Ok time to go eat my big ass slut roll.."}
{"text":"The last 2 times I went, the sushi was just ok. In the past, it was great, but I don't know what happened these last times. Maybe they had a new chef or new management or something.

The yellowtail that was in the candycane roll was tough & chewy. And it seemed like all the rolls we ordered were not proportioned right - like there was too much rice. Maybe they wanted us to get full fast, since we ordered all you can eat. But at least the appetizers were still delicious.

And there's one waitress who doesn't smile. I mean, she's attentive & she's not rude or anything. But by not smiling, she doesn't seem friendly."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, good miso soup. Great sushi, loved the spicy tuna!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. The service just really sucked! The waitress we had would address me by saying, \"Excuse me customer your order coming!\" Don't bother to come here. Go somewhere else where you will be treated nicely!  You've been warned. Good luck!"}
{"text":"You cannot beat the price for the quality.  I like the plum wine (it is a cheap plum wine but is tasty) and the selection of Asian beer.

I love the roll names too.  My favorites are the Lasagna and Fat A$s rolls."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. It's small, clean, quiet with light music in the background, the food is delicious, and the service is nice. Love the variety. Coming again."}
{"text":"So happy to have an awesome little sushi restaurant so close to home!  This place is very cozy and decorated nicely.  I love how some of the tables are sectioned off and it feels like you have your own little room.  The Screaming O is AWESOME!  I get mine without the mayo (Yuck).  I've tried a few of their rolls and they are pretty good too.  The serving staff is nice and makes you feel comfortable as well.

Although, I am a fan of the food, I must admit that I'm not a fan of some the roll's names.  The place looks a little upscale but then you open the menu you find some pretty gutter worthy names.  (Taste Like My Ex-Girlfriend, Something A**, and more)  Really?!  I would expect these poor taste names in a college dive bar but not in a neighborhood sushi restaurant in a family area.  The first time I ate here I had my 13 year old daughter and one of her friends with me and was very disappointed by the NC-17 sushi names.  I wish I had known before the kids were given menus!

If it weren't for the trashy names of some of their rolls, I would have given this place 4 stars and a half stars, only because they are a little pricey and don't offer AYCE.  It really is a great little place that seems to be having identity issues..."}
{"text":"To sum up my dinner and I quote the server \"We're limited because it's not good for business\".  What the heck does that even mean?  Why advertise it if you won't even have it.  

The night I went I had all you can eat and decided to pay extra for nigiri.  Among the items that they did not have were salmon collar, oysters, uni, etc.  You're not going to have these items because it's not good for business if you don't sell it?  

It's obvious they bank their money off of selling just rolls but what's bad for your business is bad for my stomach.  It'd be two stars had they not charged me the extra nigiri price I paid to try the above listed items.  

Naka sushi a couple blocks down is the better substitute."}
{"text":"This is my regular sushi spot. I like their AYCE - it has a decent variety. The nigiri is usually good sized and fresh. My favorite item is the spicy tuna cracker, which has spicy tuna on top of rice that has been fried, then it is all topped with a jalape√±o slice and a splash of hot sauce. They do have frequent guest card too, which makes it nice as every once-in-a-while, I get my meal for free."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat and the Sushi about twice a month.  The sushi rolls are always fresh, the chef's accomodating, and the decor is really nice.  I was skeptical that the sushi wasn't as fresh when they turned AYCE but we tried it last Friday and it was still delicious.  

The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because a couple times our bill was screwed up. I think they need some help marketing the business...."}
{"text":"I recommend this place, but have not gone here recently.  My daugther loves the sushi here. So when she's in town, I take her here.  

-Place is quiet usually.  Been here for lunch and dinner, never busy.
-Couple of TV's and since it's quiet enough, I'm usually able to change the channels. 
-Always great service here.  
-Price is average, but the sushi is fresh.
-AYCE on par with most.  

What I've Tried:
-Tiger Roll:  My favorite
-Lasagna Roll:  Not too bad, just bad for you.
-Golden California:  My daughter's favorite. 
-Utah Roll:  My 2nd Favorite
-Teriyaki Chicken:  Tasty

This place use to have one fo the cheapest AYCE lunch specials (around $12).  Last time I was here, it' was gone.  Hopefully it comes back."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! The service is great, the staff is super nice and the fish is definitely great quality. The rolls are creative and have great taste. Try their tuna Karai, Holy cow and megabucks they are fantastic."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this establishment for at least 5 years. It's had its ups and downs, but the past year it has been a very solid sushi option. I come here at least once a week and continue to be satisfied with the quality of food. Salmon and Yellowtail are always fresh, and you can modify any roll for just a dollar (try spider roll with spicy tuna). When you can leave a place for under $30.00 with the amount of food you get, you can't really complain. Absolutely recommend it."}
{"text":"One of my go-to's for sushi in this area of Las Vegas. Megabucks and x-girlfriend are my favorite rolls at this sushi restaurant. Service can vary but has been good the last times I have been."}
{"text":"Very challenging to order now. The regular menu does not match up with the AYCE.  Many of the ones you want that are on the menu are not available on the AYCE menu. The AYCE menu has no descriptions - only the name of the rolls. Thus my choosing the words \"challenging\" to order. 

I think I'm done with this place.  I don't think it stands out enough to keep coming"}
{"text":"The food and service is great.
Have high chairs for kids which can be important for family's....
Great AYCE with a modest price point.
A few flat screens are also around the restaurant with mostly sports.

Overall
Food: 4-5
Beverage: 3-4
Cleanliness: 3-5
Service: 3-5
Come back: Decent sushi so sure why not"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and by the looks of it so did many others. First Friday of lent and this place used to be packed.  Service used to be friendly and accommodating the waitress we had tonight was just stupid and rude and doesn't belong in this business . The menu isn't the same either. The sushi is not as good anymore either for the 26 bucks ayce with a 1 hour limit .  I'm going back to KOBE SUSHI on W Flamingo and Fort Apache and won't be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"For our local sushi spot I love this place. 

This is just a stones throw away from our house and the pricing here is unbeatable. All you can eat is $20 if you don't want nigir and $25 if you do. 

The fish here always tastes fresh and the service is good. Your drinks are never empty and there is never a wait for a table.

My favorite rolls are: 
What the hell
Salmon Ass
Salmon Lover
 
On the appetizer list you must try the spicey rice cracker! It is so good its ridiculous!! 

I've eaten here about 5 times, and only had one little hiccup, last night we ordered the Sushi Special Roll, and the tuna tasted kinda weird so we sent it back. The server was very apologetic and asked if we wanted anything else. This has only happened one time so I will still come back :)

Overall a great price for how much food you can get!!"}
{"text":"So I'm new to sushi this year, but I've now sampled from about 6 different restaurants in the Henderson, Las vegas area.  True, The Sushi is a good 10-15% more expensive then all the other places Ive been to (hence 4 stars instead of 5)  but its really good!  Check out the Davo, its a spicy roll with tuna, salmon, yellow tail , avocado and I think shrimp.  The hot factor comes from the minute shavings of jalapeno's on top mixed with some other stuff... not sure what... anyway I digress.  The staff is very friendly, the sushi chefs take care in preparing their dishes, they always look attractive , fresh and well made."}
{"text":"Hidden in a gas station parking lot you will find the most fire sushi spot off the strip. Its all good here."}
{"text":"I loved the look of this place and the employees were so nice and they were very quick on getting the sushi out. Plus it was nice to go to a place that doesn't charge and arm and left for ayce dinner. My son fell asleep on me while I was eating and then I was about ready to leave the lady working ran over and helped hold the door open for me. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced AYCE sushi restaurant just north of Summerlin. Pretty good selection with a Korean kick makes this place worth trying. The service is great and the staff are quite friendly. Not too busy like some other sushi joints which means faster service without the long wait."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst sushi I've ever eaten. Takeout order. Veggie and shrimp tempura where cold and greasy. Miso soup tasted like water. Also ordered a tuna roll, Alaska roll, holy cow, and put your hands up roll. All of the rolls tasted a little \"off\" and were either bland, sticky, or just bad. Would not return."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood again and popped in, around 1PM My daughter is Vegan now and we were iffy on Ayce but our very nice waitress showed her the many choices so it was a go. Everything was fresh, tasty and diversely laid out, Want good Bulgogi they have it, 2 Thumbs up for this place, I personally need to get there more offten for support and my belly!!"}
{"text":"I saw the way they handled a fellow customers situation and it was embarrassing and unprofessional. There are plenty of sushi spots in Vegas, I will take my business elsewhere.."}
{"text":"went back with my boyfriend and suggested the hot woody roll but we couldnt find it in the menu:[ i asked the server and she gave us the old menu and i found it!! i was raving about this roll till it came..
 it was different this was not the sushi roll that i had when it first opened it was good but not deliciously good like the old one. eh then i read the other reviews and figured out that they changed chefs.. boo! boo! sushi's still good they have a great choice of menu still, i just wish they still made their previous rolls the right way."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi I've ever had. I was visiting from Phoenix and my boyfriend and I decided to stop for sushi before heading home. We were not disappointed. He is more picky about where we go for sushi but this place was amazing!! The fish tasted super fresh, the complementary cumcuber salad was so delicious, the edemame was good too. We were both very impressed and the price wasn't bad either. We got 2 specialty rolls, 2 regular rolls, and edemame for $40. I highly recommend this place and will definitely go again next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"nothing really stood out about this place. one thing that I liked was that nigiri was cut thick, which I prefer.  I don't know about the rolls cuz I don't really get rolls when I go to sushi places. strip salmon was decent. spicy tuna rice crackers were better than the ones at goyemon. uni was brown... not yellow.... brown... very suspicious. service wasn't that great even though this place wasn't that busy. I don't think I can recommend this place to anyone. only positive about this place is that it's ayce and their Nigiri is decent. I may come here only if I'm in the area and in desperate need of sushi. I still prefer goyemon or sumo sushi 2."}
{"text":"I went to The Sushi when they first opened several years ago. It wasn't a memorable experience and I didn't return until a few weeks ago. My experience was just the same as it was my first visit. 

The AYCE option was $17, but that's for rolls and kitchen appetizers only. If you want nigiri as part of the package, you have to pay another $5. So really, AYCE is $22 per person. 

I asked if they had hirame and they said no. Then I asked if they had toro, to which they scoffed and said, \"This is all you can eat.\" That's fine. But I have been to other AYCE places that served a limited portion of otoro or chutoro. 

Otherwise it was a pretty standard AYCE sushi experience -- friendly attentive Korean staff, hot green tea, long list of ridiculous roll options, clean facilities, went home fat and happy.

{"text":"Freshest fish in town and the lunch Salmon bento box is on point.  Wish they had an all you can eat."}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood sushi bar. The Anthem & Cucumber rolls are best!"}
{"text":"I am extremely conflicted writing this review. I've been here 5-6 times and have always had a fantastic experience. The food was always yummy. I loved the cucumber passion roll, and the all you can eat for $22.00 is always a great deal. This time however, was awful. The service was terrible. There were only a handful of customers there and there were 2 free boothes open. We asked tobe seated at a booth and for some reason this started us down a path of hateful service. They refused to seat us for like 7 minutes and then once they did they ignored us for another 10 or so minutes. There were 2 waitresses this night, and as I stated earlier, only a handful of customers. No excuse in my opinion. They would hardly talk to us and acted as if we were an inconvenience to them while being nice to the other customers. 

The food was for the first time at this place lacking. A few of the rolls were good but they were so chinsey with the fish and avacado this time. Seriously, one of my salmon rolls, I couldn't even find a piece of salmon in the roll. Very upsetting. 

Anyways, usually its awesome so I'll go back again. Hoping for a better experience. If its bad again though, I will assume it won't be good ever again. They need to get their act together."}
{"text":"The sushi here was very heavy. I am a fan of sushi that is fresh tasting, light, and bright. This sushi seemed like it was all deep fried, and no I didn't order tempura. The presentation was also a bit drab and unappealing. I will not go back. Not the worst, but not worth the price."}
{"text":"The Sushi is the bomb!! Their sushi rolls are fresh and extremely yummy!! Gotta mention their sushi name is one of the kind. Kiss of fire, taste like my ex girlfriend, don't touch her mustache and way more creative names. Their services are two thumbs up!! I don't think you could found a better sushi place in Henderson area!!"}
{"text":"The food is always great minus the brown rice. We usually order to go and it's fantastic. If you're dining in though, the wait time for food is a little long."}
{"text":"This place has a comfortable low lit yet fun atmosphere. The Sushi here is pretty good, they have a lot of spicy options (perhaps too many?) that don't have too much heat but will definitely get you sweating with the all you can eat dinner option. Amongst the several rolls I tried I had their Vegas Roll. This roll, amongst others, is something you can use as an apples to apples comparison between sushi joints and I really enjoyed what I got here. The rice on this one was a bit loose but the fish quality was good and it wasn't overly battered. Really the overall theme of sushi here is pretty good but the atmosphere makes it more than worthwhile."}
{"text":"Omg worst sushi place ever!! Do not go here, there was a roach on the sushi bar.
This was the first and last time at the Sushi!
All u can eat items are terrible and not based on menu prices. Fish is not fresh, cheap ass sushi food"}
{"text":"** TASTY LOCAL SUSHI**

This shopping center has had a rash of restaurants over the last decade, I hope this one stays around. I have been coming here at least once a week the last 6 months.
They keep fresh quality fish in stock and they Chef's create some unique dishes I have not had anywhere else.

The \"Utah Roll\" is one such creation that is absolutely delicious. Also the Spicy Tuna Cracker is great. 

The service here is also very good. I walk in and I dont even have to order becuase they know what I am drinking and what appatizers I will be orders."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite sushi place in the area. Great prices and great food. Never had a bad experience here. Waitresses are always prompt in bringing drinks and food. They always check up on you whereas other places I've been you end up looking over the booths for your waitress."}
{"text":"hands down one of my favorite sushi places... presentation is absolutely delightful. service is also great!"}
{"text":"food is always so good here and they always have good customer service. really nice place for eating and relaxing for an hour, hour and a half. i've been coming here for about 3 years now and it has never dissatisfied me. the yellowtail sashimi is so good!!"}
{"text":"Can't beat this place - we go all the time -   and i always bring friend from out of town -"}
{"text":"The Sushi's shimmering sign caught my attention so I finally made it a point to check this place out! The decor inside  is nice an calming with their tall booths.

I don't often go for the \"all you can eat \"sushi because my husband who typically comes with me doesn't eat \"that stuff\". I hate pigging out in front of him while he eats a salad but I had to this time. The price was cheap 20.95 for all you can eat but I knew I couldn't eat more than two rolls. It was still cheaper than buying them separately though. 

I had the Vegas Roll and the BBQ Roll. I love when places put meat on sushi rolls . It feels like a mini surf and turf meal! I love it! My husband may not like sushi but he couldn't  walk away from dessert . It was pretty cute and refreshing on a hot night!"}
{"text":"So the name is like naming a place The Pizza or The Burger or The Taco. 

That said, The Sushi wins big points for the taste, but not for the portions or the price.

Inside is nice and cozy, with a basketball-arena style four-screen TV in the middle.

If price and portions were no object, this would be a five-star sushi bar as the care and taste of the sushi and sashimi can't be beat. 

The problem is the pricing is above many other sushi bars in the area. And the portions - especially when it comes to the teriyaki dishes - are more set for hamsters than people. 

The staff was cordial and offered hot tea or water to this guest waiting for a to-go order. 

All in all, a slight recommendation if price is no object and you're not THAT hungry."}
{"text":"When I lived in Vegas this was by far my favorite sushi restaurant. It's still pretty good but I feel like it isn't as it used to be. Though the menu has changed quite a bit through the years some favorite items still remain such as the Mexican roll, wet dream, and The Who's your daddy roll. 

Speaking of those, the menu is full of fun names and flavors! This makes for an interesting order experience with friends. The mussels are delicious as is the \"screaming O\" seared ahi tuna, and seaweed salad. 

The service is kind of slow but I feel like they do that on purpose so you don't eat as much. Maybe I'm just used to my normal place knowing me and being excellent.... lastly I'm not too happy with the prices or the \"roll special\". The roll special doesn't include a lot of the menu, like nigiri. Nigiri is so simple and cheap I feel like this should be a part of the special. It's $17.95 for appetizers and rolls only. Otherwise lunch is 21.95 which is extremely expensive for AYCE when I'm used to 21.95 for dinner at home. 

I'll probably only come for the occasional lunch when I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place was awesome and little hidden gem. The waitresses left a bit to be desired but the food was awesome.  And they were willing to assist with my dietary restrictions. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Was greeted promptly and seated at a dirty table. When the waitress finally came over she seemed very annoyed to wait on us. It was our first time here and she was even more annoyed that we had questions about the menu. NO ice. They ran out? Soda was warm and flat. Rolls were very sloppily made with no presentation. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday but came a little late but they still took us in, i had the lake mead and my bf had the ex girl friend and both tasted amazing, the ex girlfriend had a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. ..old beef mixed with the new..and also the fish for the poke and salmon salads,fish was old...lots of things on the menu extremely sweet..staff not attentive...business is slow paced for some reason"}
{"text":"This might the sushi sleeper in Henderson.  I met a coworker for lunch here since it is near work, at her suggestion.  They have lunch specials, plenty of cooked options, and sushi.

For my first time here, I figured the lunch special is a pretty good deal. $12.50 for 6 pieces of sushi or sashimi, 1 roll from a list, and miso soup plus salad.  There were also lunch bentos (pick 2 from a list) but all were cooked options.

I opted for sushi, so I could try the rice.  After the soup and salad, I was presented with a very simple but beautiful plate...with generous cuts of nigiri and the roll.  I received 2 pieces each of maguro (very deep red, beautiful), nama sake, and hamachi.  They were arranged in a colorful pattern.  I also got the spicy yellowtail roll as my roll choice.

I was surprised honestly - the quality was definitely decent for our landlocked region and the rice was good.  I also got a green iced tea, which was served in a large glass, limiting any need for a refill.  Our server was very nice and quick.  We were in and out in under 35 minutes!  It is quiet inside and there is a cherry blossom painted on the back wall.  The ambiance is nice.  This is a definitely a good lunch spot on this side of town."}
{"text":"We had a party of twelve, celebrating a birthday. We had little ones with us so we were there fairly early on a week night. I think we may have been only group in there.  Service was great and the sushi rolls were even better. This may be my new sushi place, and that is saying a lot!"}
{"text":"Good sushi with all you can eat options."}
{"text":"Love the chicken teriyaki here . Cute little booth set ups and love the bar set up . Husband love the beer and sushi ."}
{"text":"I have been to the Sushi about 6 times within the past few months. This place just keeps getting better and better.....I was never that much into Rolls before, but their creations are incredible.....and if you just want Sashimi or Nigiri, the quaility is excellent.. I have been to many other Sushi Restaurants/Bars in Las Vegas, and around the world, and this place is at the top of my list... Great Friendly Service.....Clean and Nice atmosphere.. and of course, Fresh High Quality Fish..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love The Sushi! It is, in my opinion, the best sushi place, we have eaten at in Las Vegas. (The 4 minute drive from my house to The Sushi isn't too bad either!) They have the BEST Screaming O I have tasted. It is so perfectly made, and pretty too! Also, their nigiri sushi is so fresh, and they give decent slices of it. I love the Banzai Roll, it's a very simple roll with shrimp tempura, crab, and various green things, wrapped in soy paper, and rice, and finally drizzled with eel sauce! Depending on which sushi chef is making it, you might also get a creamy sauce on top as well. Which is a little unneccessary, because I don't think it changed the flavor of the roll at all. Also, The Tastes like My Ex-Girlfriend is also a great roll if you're looking for a little bit of spice in a roll. I am not a huge spicy fan, but, it is the perfect amount of kick for me! 
The wait staff is so nice, and they are very competent. I highly recommend this place to all of my friends."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi spot in Summerlin. Final Destination roll is highly suggested."}
{"text":"Went this evening for a girls night out and it left us hungry. Got here at 7pm and ordered the Lisa Lisa, KBBQ and the Spider. We then didn't see the waiter for 45 minutes... or our sushi. We had to ask where our sushi was at one point. But to their credit, we did get our gyoza quick when ordered.

Also, they changed their name to Sushi Wabi- they are under new ownership"}
{"text":"Amazing and now they have low carb sushi. I love the exceptional guest service. It is friendly professional and extended through much kindness. Try this place and I think you will make it one of your \"must go favorites\". To truly experience this food you must celebrate the tradition, this is not American version Japanese food. It is the real deal ."}
{"text":"Came out from California on vacation and decided to check this place out for lunch. The all you can eat price is $21.95 which is about how much i paid back home so I didnt mind trying this place out. The food quality is amazing! Nice, fresh, and delicious! The service was a bit slow, but my family and I didn't mind at all as we would order an appetizer or soup along with a roll so we were always eating. Totally plan on coming back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Being new to Vegas my 17 yr old son and i were in search of a good sushi spot. This place is so close to the house so we thought, why not give it a try. The sushi was good, service was good, prices were good and ambiance was good. The one thing that ruined our experience was the music! They were playing what sounded like Japanese easy listening that had been translated to english, and it was loud! We couldn't even hear ourselves talk. Would have stayed longer and ordered more if wasn't for that. Owners, play music we all know and turn it WAY down!"}
{"text":"Bad service OK sushi expensive price for not that great of an experience or meal will not return and urge others to go to other restaurants and avoid this one"}
{"text":"Unfortunately we had a really slow experience at The Sushi tonight. We enjoyed that it's an all you can eat but we placed ONE order up front upon being seated and they brought it out piece by piece (normally fine) SO slowly that at the three hour mark we finally cancelled everything we had left coming because we had to head to the airport.

We enjoyed the K.BBQ Roll, bulgogi Korean BBQ Roll and the Salmon and Tuna nigiri. The fresh oysters were a little too fishy tasting and the escolar nigiri that was a little stringy.

Unfortunately the service was way too slow and I will choose Yummy Sushi next time."}
{"text":"Terrible Service! Seriously it was a good place before the lack of service is terrible. Will not be coming here don't waste your money at this establishment. 

So many other places to go to and spend your money don't do it here!"}
{"text":"Our go to place for sushi. We order a la care to avoid overeating, 2 rolls each and we're good. Friendly staff, clean, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Love their rolls. Pearl and put your hands up are great.  Wish they had all you can eat but ala carte if worth it here."}
{"text":"GOOD Service Nice location. Chefs will make you whatever u want. Even \"surprise me\" works. If it wasn't so expensive, I would go more. But Sushi's NOT cheap. An ALL YOU CAN EAT for $25 WOULD BE NICE.  I will return regardless."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi and boxed lunches and dinner boxes  uni is sweet and delicious, and all at great prices!"}
{"text":"2nd time coming and the sushi was horrible. Maybe it was an off night but the quality of the fish was very poor. The rolls were bland. I mean, their baked green mussels were so watered down and gamey that I had to spit it out. And it took the waitress at least 15 minutes just to get us water. I live down the street from this place but I would rather drive an extra 20 minutes just to enjoy sushi elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is great! Tried it for the first time in celebration of my brother's birthday and it was delicious! AYCE was only $20.95 and there are so many rolls and appetizers to choose from! We ordered around 15 rolls and the wait time wasn't long at all. The appetizers would be my only complaint because the fried rice and teriyaki salmon that we ordered came in extremely small servings, but they made up for that with the good portion of sushi rolls.

A roll that stood out was definitely the banzai roll! It looks simple and it seems like it has too much rice, but it was surprisingly delicious and is now one of my favorites! Definitely try this place out if you're in the area! Totally worth your money!"}
{"text":"After a 2+ year vacancy following the closure of a decent restaurant, Jimmy's Cafe, and before then, the Summerlin location of Mama Jo's, FINALLY, we have another tenant in this seemingly difficult location.  The SUSHI's other location is about as far as you can get in the LV Valley, located at 95 and Horizon Ridge, so it makes sense that the Sushi would try its luck at this location in the older part of Summerlin.

My family and I visited last night (encouraged by a 50% off coupon received in the mail), and consumed quite a bit of food.  I can't say anything stood out as \"extraordinary\", but the sushi was fresh enough, and the kitchen entrees (beef teriyaki and kids' bento box) were as good as they usually are.  Maybe a little too sweet on the Teriyaki sauce.  And we were dismayed that the Short Ribs were not available.  The udon noodles were ok, too, though we had to remind our server that they were supposed to come with Tempura shrimp (so they cooked that up separately).  I ordered the Chirashi (sashimi morsels sprinkled atop a bowl of rice), and they did a good job...though I may have been the first one to order this since they opened!

My only gripe with The Sushi, I suppose, could be a reflection of my age and traditional Japanese roots (I was born in Japan, and my Mom is native Japanese).  Here in 2010, it seems like SUSHI can only be paired with drinking shots (sake or otherwise), boisterous sushi chefs, and...well...again, I show my age, but the whole Gen-X (and later) ambiance.  There was a huge 72\" screen TV airing a video of a concert (with sound volume to match) on one wall...and, back to the food, 3/4 of the menu seemed to be an attempt to come up with the latest and greatest mixture of cream-cheese, ponzu sauce, different fish roe, and jalapeno flavors....to justify roll names like \"Cocaine\" or \"Something Special #1\".  Whatever happened to traditional JAPANESE sushi...served in a more tranquil, if not quite \"Zen\" setting?

We'll be back, since this is not only the closest Sushi place to our home, but the closest restaurant to home of any kind...but for once, it would be refreshing to see a Sushi/Japanese restaurant strive for authenticity instead of trying to push every frenetic boundary as an excuse to attract the next party to its establishment.

So go ahead...call me an old fogey!  But...this may be a little telling since their Lake Mead location (corner of Rampart) is a bit removed from the \"singles\" epicenters...and dangerously close to a blanket of *real* elderly clientele (much older than me LOL)...and that's the Del Webb Sun City crowd.  I would be thrilled to see The Sushi maybe tone down the noise level and 'flash', and try for a little more subdued, quality presentation of Japanese food.  But that's just me."}
{"text":"Regulars Wendy and Larry took me there a couple weeks ago and I decided it will be a once-a-month event! It's in the budget. I loved the way they made the rolls without rice. I've had other riceless rolls with cucumber and haven't been a big fan. The sushi was filling but didn't fill me up too much. The sauces and presentation were extremely creative, well-executed and tasty. I love the family environment and how everyone made me feel welcome. See you in November, The Sushi!"}
{"text":"Meh.  The fish wasn't that great, the salmon wasn't fresh, and they messed up the sake bombs."}
{"text":"Like the vibe here. Clean. Like the sushi bar wraparound. Clean high quality fish. Like the sushi 6 piece lunch special. Will be back. Nice servers."}
{"text":"The food was great. I enjoyed the tonkatsu entree and my buddy enjoyed the AYCE sushi. The issue was with the service, it was awful. They took forever to come back to reorder sushi and they also messed up on the bill and charged things we did not even order. Took nearly 2 hours to eat a meal that should have been an hour tops. Service needs work."}
{"text":"Good sushi for an all-you-can-eat.  Had brunch there Sunday and was impressed with the quality for the price.  The favorites were: Bonzai, Blackjack and definitely the stuffed mushrooms.  Service could be a little more on-the-ball but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised with their lunch specials. I ordered a bento box and it came with 6 options that were yummy and filling. The price was $10.00 and it was well worth it. The portions were good and the diversity of the options was also pleasing. 

I ordered as an appetizer the garlic endamame. I though the flavor was ok but a bit too spicy for my liking. Some of the pieces were a bit tough which makes me think it might have been raw. The flavor on them was good but I wish they were less spicy. 

The service was also good. We were the only people there which seemed a bit surprising. I would definitely go back here for lunch again and try their other offerings. They seem to have an extensive sushi menu which I an curious to try soon."}
{"text":"This place opened up in recent years, not too far from my house. I didn't get a chance to try it until a few weeks ago, but I am glad I finally got a chance to do so.

Essentially, this place has 2 dining options - a sushi bar, or you can sit at \"normal\" tables and order food that way. I have sat at the \"normal\" tables during my visits, and from what I have seen the staff tend to be more attentive at the sushi bar. Granted, this isn't to be unexpected, given what the restaurant proudly proclaims in its name.

The service tends to be a bit hit and miss. Sometimes I went for long periods of time with no one coming to check on me, and sometimes they did tend to get orders confused - last time I dined in there, the busboy put a lemon in my water even though I distinctly told him not to. Still, everyone is friendly, so they've got that going for them.

The food itself that I have had there so far is good. I have mostly had chicken dishes, which have been quite tasty. If you've ever gone into one of the many teppanyaki restaurants in Vegas and eaten in their \"normal\" seats and not the cook tables, the food you can order here is pretty similar to that. So far I have tried the Chicken Teriyaki and the Chicken Katsu (hope I spelled that right), and both were very good. My big complaint with the food is that they cover the plate in garnish (onions, peppers, lettuce, etc.), and not enough of it with the actual food item. When I come into a Japanese restaurant and am actually able to FINISH my food, that's a telltale sign that the entree servings are too small. Still, what little I ate was quite tasty.

Their menu is quite large and diverse - more so than I would have expected from a little \"hole in the wall\" place like this (and it's nicer in here than it looks from the outside!) Regardless of tastes I think you'll find something here you'll enjoy.

And the quality of choices on the menu expands onto their dessert menu. They've got the traditional Japanese restaurant choices (mochi ice cream and the like) plus a variety of other unexpected things. 

This place isn't perfect, but it's still a nice addition to the neighborhood, and their food is quite good. It would be great to have them add in teppanyaki-style dining in the future, but until then, this will have to do - and that's all right with me. 

Long story short, if you live in the \"old Henderson\" area, it's worth checking out, but don't drive halfway across town to eat here."}
{"text":"My family comes here often. It's a nice set up you can sit at the bar or on a table. Soft lighting and wide range of rolls available. They do have my favorite coke products! They offer all you can eat at a reasonable price. The service is consistent they are fast and friendly. They do serve alcohol not exactly sure what kinds."}
{"text":"Prices are good. Really liked the tuna poki might be the best I've had here in Vegas. Vegetable fried rice was flavorful and delicious for just being a vegetable fried rice. The stir fried veggies they serve on the side of your entree platters is tasty, eat it right away because it taste best hot. The erotic bomba dessert is awesome try it. From the outside the restaurant looks like a hole in the wall but it's huge inside. The bathroom is immaculate. Best part my kids' loved their food and ate everything! They have AYCE prices for kids depending on age."}
{"text":"I recommend the all you can eat sushi option.  My boyfriend and I definitely ate enough to justify the cost."}
{"text":"Terrible service. No one smiles and they don't seem to care about customer quality. Bad vibe, especially for a sushi place. Tatas Asian bistro has same sushi for half the price. Food is okay, but over priced for the quality, the Salmon Nigiri smelled less than fresh."}
{"text":"I have gotten sushi to-go twice from this place and neither time have I been impressed.  For those people who have enjoyed their sushi, they have never had real sushi.  Both times I ordered sushi, you can tell they were rushed and didn't care because my rolls weren't sealed and started to unravel by the time I got home.  And the rolls a simple - tuna roll and salmon and avocado roll.  Sure it tastes ok but presentation wise I've seen better. And this last time I ordered a salad as well.  For $3.50 I got old lettuce that was turning red and carrots.  If I'm going to pay that much for a salad, it better be fresh with tomatoes and cucumbers and it better look a whole lot better than something they pulled from the fridge and threw in a box.  I'm sorry but Whole Foods is better than this place and just as cheap for these rolls."}
{"text":"For my 1st time having Sushi this place was great. My friend took me, glad she did the Garlic Tuna and Candy Cane Roll were really good. The cucumber salad was so good. And I don't even like cucumbers!"}
{"text":"On an impromptu dinner, a coworker and I decided to try somewhere close to our houses. I'm always in the right mood for sushi, so I thought this place was going to work out just right. I'm glad we chose it, because I had a great time!

The intersection this restaurant sits on is a busy one for the area. It's filled with grocery stores, shops, restaurants, gas stations and bars. Definitely a lively area for Henderson. When you walk in, you'll notice a very modern place. After the hostess station there are separated date night rooms to the right and another dining area to the left.  The big focal point in this restaurant is the sushi bar, taking up almost half the restaurant. Business signs, flat screen tvs and exposed ceiling air ducts bring out the modern look for sure. Along with the wall dividers and the sushi bar, bamboo plants are used to break out the room into smaller intimate dining areas. Our servers were really nice. They were accommodating and very attentive when they were around. At times, it was hard to flag one down as they would congregate on the far side of the restaurant, away from the guests. Also, there's a \"head honcho\" lady that works the hostess station.  I say head honco because she certainly acted like it. She walked around eating, speaking loudly, kind of a turn off. If she was meaning to let everyone know that she was the boss, she certainly did that with no shame. 

For starters, I got the White Truck pinot grigio wine for $7 a glass. It was light, crisp with a sweet ending. Super refreshing for my meal. For my starter, I got the Hamachi/Yellowtail collar for $8.95. I can't get enough of this stuff! Grilled yellowtail served with a ponzu sauce. Super flaky and marbleized. Grilled to perfection. One only piece of feedback: it came after my actual meal came. Speaking of, I decided on the chicken katsu for $12.50. Breaded chicken, deep fried and served with katsu (ketchup based) dipping sauce. The meal was served with miso soup and salad. The plate came with a scoop of rice and grilled veggies. I thought the chicken was light, the breading wasn't too heavy and super crispy. The sauce was a little to dark and strong from my \"kastu\" taste. Seemed to have a lot of Worcestershire sauce or similar. The veggies were sauteed in soy sauce and a little too salty but at least brought another element to the fried dish. All in all, I'd say it was pretty flavorful!

I'm so glad to have discovered another sushi restaurant close to home! Sushi is something I can eat again and again. Although I had no sushi on this night, I really enjoyed myself and the company. If you're ever in the area and looking for a place to welcome you and your company, stop by The Sushi. It's a surprisingly great treat!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch this week, as I heard about the new $12.99  AYCE lunch promotion.   I was very happy with the selections of rolls on the AYCE menu. Nigri sushi extra but very reasonable... Very friendly waitress and sushi chefs... Overall a terrific lunch option for those in Summerlin.  Great value!! I will be back and soon.."}
{"text":"This is my fav AYCE sushi place. Because it's so close to my house and they always are playing 90's r&b and boy bands"}
{"text":"AYCE!  I love you already...

And with sushi rolls named Salmon Ass, Screaming \"O\", Ex-Girlfriend, Fat Ass, Who's Your Daddy, and Wet Dream, who wouldn't love you?

Let's see, what did I eat?  

Baked Green Mussels - This used to be a secret menu item at a restaurant in Harwood Heights, but now I see it everywhere.  However, not all places make it quite to my tasting, but the Sushi does a fine job.  Could use some masago mixed in with the mayo, just saying....

Tuna Poki - Kind of like a seaweed salad with some raw tuna cubes thrown on, topped with green onions.  I was expecting it to be Hawaiian style tuna poke, where the fish makes up the bulk of the dish, but having it this way made less full than if I ate a bowlful of tuna.

Fried Gyoza - Fried crispy, and filled with pork and chicken, this is one of my favorite appetizers to eat at any Japanese restaurant.

Shrimp tempura - Cooked perfectly, which to me is undercooked, because I love a crispy light textured batter with the soft shrimp inside the tempura shell. The sauce accompanying the shrimp was very delicately flavored.

Japanese Hot Chicken - described as fried, seasoned chicken.  It was pretty much fried, seasoned chicken.  Although, I was expecting drumettes, this was a flat piece of breast cut diagonally.  Juicy cut of meat with minimal extras.  It was good, it tasted so clean, I don't even know how to describe it.

Salmon Collar - This is the area of the fish right behind, or under (depending on how you look at it) the head of the fish.  What I love about the collar of any fish is that they have this wonderful fat content which makes it seem buttery, but instead of bad butterfat, you get wonderful Omega 3!  More taste, less guilt!  Lightly dressed with Ponzu sauce. 
  
Spicy Tuna Crunch - One of the last things I ate, it was sort of like a spicy tuna roll deep fried to a golden crisp.  

Korean Bulgogi with Rice - It was a little oily for me, but I'm a sucker for sweet tasting thinly sliced ribeye on top of rice.  This was actually the first thing I ate, and I probably should have saved it for last.  Rice is the archenemy of the all you can eater. 

I had a few pieces of the rolls, I just don't remember which ones since I didn't actually order them myself, but they were all very inventive and fresh

Other than the food, the best part of the dining experience here was the music playing in the dining room.  How else do you explain hearing country, hip hop, and Skrillex all in the same hour?  

Awesomeness, that's how."}
{"text":"Honestly, I regret I have paid $25 for their All You Can Eat with nigiri for dinner. Their fish was out of freshness, almost bad, and I was so shocked when I got served with their \"scallop nigiri\". 
Cheat! They told me it's a scallop, but really, it is a bit of scallop chunk mixed with processed crab chunk. Don't think I will never ever go back again. Lame."}
{"text":"The hubby and I decided to give this place a shot. What a disappointment. The only thing that they got right was the miso soup. Yes, you read that right miso soup! I ordered a shrimp tempura roll-one of the most basic rolls you could order and it was just awful. It didn't taste fresh and was covered with tons of tempura flakes. I asked for a side of sauce and when I asked if there was eggs in it the waitress said I don't know and looked at me like I was bothering her. Then she asked if I really needed to know. I said yes it would be nice to know and she said well then don't eat it?!! I couldn't believe it. If you're going to work at restaurant you must know ingredients for dishes or at least be willing to ask the chef. People are allergic to many things and to act like we are asking for something that's nearly impossible c'mon. Anyway husband has the chicken katsu and shrimp fried rice, it wasn't authentic at all!! I would rather drive an extra 10 min to island sushi or my ultimate favorite goyemon."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Always has great service, great prices and FRESH sushi! Clean quiet and comfortable."}
{"text":"I had a great 1st visit and I will definitely be back. From the moment we walked in the door we were greeted with 
friendly smiles, the restaurant had modern, fresh vibe and everyone seemed to be having a great time. We did the all you can eat which was a deal at 20.95 for anything on the menu except nigiri. That was 4.00 more. The sushi was excellent. Great flavor, well presented by real sushi chefs. My husband and I will deffinately be back!"}
{"text":"What a great evening! I can't think of a reason to dock any stars so 5 star it is.

I wanted to find a sushi place close to home and I'm glad Yelp led me here. First off it's a nice cozy atmosphere. You can choose between the bar or intimate booths and tables. We were greeted right away and had a Sapporo on the table in under 5 minutes. The menu had so many amazing choices it was hard to decide but we went for some smoked eel, clam, a spicy scallop roll and one of their specialty rolls that was also spicy but I can't remember the name. Dragon fire maybe? The eel was the best I've had. So tender and flavorful. Just melted in my mouth. Both rolls were excellent. The clam wasn't my favorite but my husband liked it. The waitress was very attentive and offered good suggestions throughout.

We ended our meal with a glass of saki and the most amazing fried heavenly balls. That's what I'm calling them at least. They had a perfect mixture of crab and cream cheese, a thin fry crust and eel sauce that was so good I'd like a bottle of it. We were full and only paid $75 including tip. Terrific evening."}
{"text":"We walked into this place around 7:45. There were about three tables open but the server asked us to wait  for some reason. After we got seated we had to flag down a server to get our drink order in. Service was very slow aside from a half empty restaurant. After we got our drinks we had to flag her down again to place our food order. She said that we couldn't order anything on the menu for another 20 minutes because the kitchen was really busy. I understand not being able to order sushi but not being able to order anything at all? Not even an appetizer?? We paid for our drinks and left."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  My favorite go to roll is the Sushi Special.  However, the 911 (not on the menu) is so so so spicy and delicious!  I get takeout her take her at least twice a week.  Please give it a try.  It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in SUMMERLIN area. Much better than Naka Sushi which is across the street. The decor is modern, nice atmosphere and clean.  The service here is good. The rolls are delicious. Not overloaded with rice like other AYCE sushi places. I like that most of the rolls have pieces that aren't overly large. I hate trying to jam a piece of sushi in my mouth before it falls apart on me. $20.95 is a great price for dinner AYCE."}
{"text":"The service here is good and quick. I had my roll in 5 minutes. I love the names of their special rolls as well. They are hilarious. The place was very clean."}
{"text":"I've never had such a terrible experience at a sushi joint before. Our waitress was extremely rude to us. She was slow to bring us our food, and there was only one other couple in there. The sushi wasn't very good either. I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"The staff is absolutely friendly. It's like home!!! The fish is very fresh and they can make anything you want. The selection of sake is pretty big, the price are not bad and you don't have to wait forever to get your food. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night kind of annoyed that they dont have constant waiters to greet you so i just headed to the sushi bar and just sat down. 
Pros: Quality of fish. Tuna Poki, Salmon Poki, 2 rolls that are without rice are excellent. 
Cons: The door says 20.95 for dinner which i found hard to believe but i was in the plaza so i walked in, ayce menu says 25.95. So which is it? 
Waiters timing with drinks etc. I ordered my food way before i got my drink order taken. 

Will go back again, maybe just hire more waiters."}
{"text":"I don't get this place, they keep changing the staff and NOT for the better!! Also the sushi chefs are getting worse!! We use to be go here regularly, but the service here has become horrible \"again\" and the food quality has gone down!! Seams like the ownership has again been changed, as the entire staff is new and careless, they act as if you are inconveniencing them!! We will be going to another Sushi spot which is farther from where we live, but has better service, which is bad for us because we use to love going here!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was okay.  However...ASSUMING that we wanted all you can eat is NOT okay. Then attempting to argue with me is also NOT okay. My boyfriend didnt like his food (he said texture and taste were not good) and they still charged him for it. $60 for two people...we could have gotten better service. We will stick with Kobe (215/rainbow) and Sushi Loca."}
{"text":"So sad that this restaurant has been bought out. We have been going here for 5 years and the new ownership and menu suck. Very disappointed! This was my favorite Sushi place! The menu was awesome and the all you can eat Sushi option was even better!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  It's actually the best, among non-AYCE sushi at this price range (mid-range). And we've tried 20 sushi places in town, all the best of referrals from our foodie friends. 

What I love: 
Screaming O 
Sashimi salad
Garlic tuna nigiri 
Cucumber passion
Playboy
The Mexican 
Candy cane
Tastes like your ex
Put your hands up 
Gyoza

There's more, there's always more. We live on the opposite end of town and regularly make the trek for lunch and dinner. 

I am appalled at the low rating; I am always complaining that every sushi restaurant in Vegas is able to get a 4 star rating it seems, and there is such a range of quality I can't understand it. And among the 3 sushi restaurants that I think actually deserve a 5 star rating, people are complaining about this one. Frankly, people are probably expecting cheap neighborhood sushi, and you're just not going to get it here. It's not even expensive. I have no problem paying for the quality here. It's consistent as hell - the lunch is as good as dinner, which I can't say anywhere else. I can't get enough of this place."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!! If I could give no stars I would...

This is probably one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a restaurant. Also one of the longest yelp reviews I've written. Literally timed my 1 hour AYCE experience here...

First of all, I never step out of my comfort zone and switch places, but tonight I decided to give this place a try. I get there at 9:00pm, its completely empty except for a couple at the bar and 2 waitresses. I sit down and notice you only get an hour to eat for $25.95. I figured with it being empty I can eat pretty good in an hour especially if I sit at the bar.

Took them 5 min to ask me what I wanted to drink (9:05) then took my order at the same time. I ordered 5 orders of nigiri sushi (2 piece order) That's 10 pieces of sushi. I also got an order of baked green muscles. At 9:10 the couple next to me place an order for a roll and 2 min later a gentlemen comes in for a to go order. 

At 9:16 the sushi chef hands the couple an order of baked green muscles. He was not aware they were mine...I wasn't even sure he noticed I was sitting at the bar. The waitress notices and speaks to the chef in Japanese. I'm sure she told him those were mine and he made a mistake. After that the waitress comes over to me and asks if there is anything else I would like while I wait. Completely disregarding the fact that my food was given away and hadn't even apologized for it. I politely said no, I will wait for my order. She walks away. 

9:20pm The to go order is now ready with 3 boxes being carried away. Still waiting on my order. 9:23 the couple receives their roll...Wtf?? Still havent gotten my food and I ordered before all of them. 9:26 I FINALLY get my baked muscles. At 9:30 I FINALLY GET MY FIRST ORDER!! It took 30 min for my first order on a Saturday night and its EMPTY!! 

The waitress came back and asked if I wanted more...of course I did! Then she had the nerve to tell me this was my last order. I couldn't order anything else after this. I said \"You're joking right? My first order took 30 min to get to me!\" All she said was \"Yeah...sorry. I was pissed to say the least. I made my second order. 

Let me tell you my 2nd order got to me within 10 minutes!! 4 (2 piece Nigiri), a deep fried 1/2 roll, and another order of baked green muscles. Wow!! Being hungry I still ate it in 10 min and I still couldn't order anything else. I was pissed off and still hungry. Any other sushi place I can EASILY get in 3 orders or more and order more than I did at one time. This was puss poor service and I've been in customer service for over 12 years.

I recommend you go to Yama Sushi, they are fast, friendly, good atmosphere, and its only $23.95 for 2 hours of AYCE sushi!! I wish I had gone there instead. 

I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE OR RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!!"}
{"text":"The sushi... The sushi.. The sushi... Where do I begin?... I use to come here last year.. Probably 4-5 times I came here over a year ago.. I loved the place, the food, and the waitress!!!! She was the main reason I kept coming back (besides the Japanese hot chicken and tempura roll). She remembered my me every time I came in, even if it was months apart! The best customer service/ waitress I have had in years!! 

CONS-
I went here within the last week and a lot has changed!! The waitress is gone and has been replaced with someone else who was outta control!!! I have never been rushed while eating!! She had about 5 other tables (around 2 on a Saturday) and we were not on her list of people to help. I order 3 items (I had all you can eat) and was done within 10 mins, the other part of my party drink was gone.. So we were all just sitting there waiting for her to come back to the table to help us.. It took for-ever! About 13 minutes after we stared her down long enough. I ordered my regular tempura roll and omg... I dunno what happened! It was all messed up!!! It had the franks onion flakes on it.. So nasty!! 

I'm just going to stop it here and sum it up..
Was once good food but so so now..
Horrible service, NON FRIENDLY waiting for a very long time to order and wait for water refill. 
change of tempura roll

Other then all that and the tempura roll BS.. The food was still the same.. It was good.

My 3 stars are for the food... If it wasn't for the food this place would get .5 of a star

RUSHED RUSHED RUSHED"}
{"text":"I've been to Raw, Kaizen, Sushi on Trop, Sushi Twister, Yama Sushi and other all you can eat sushi places but for some reason this place is, hands down, one of the best sushi places that I've been to. Not to mention it's only a few minutes away from my house.

The atmosphere is warm and cozy. The service is always fast and the sushi chef's are always friendly. 

Every time I come here, I order the dynamite. Other places can't compare to The Sushi's dynamite. Something about their baked delicious dish with white rice, scallops and mushrooms topped with their cheesy goodness and sauces is a MUST try if you come here."}
{"text":"The worst service ever! We waited last night for 30 minutes for our roll order to be taken and 1 1/2hr for anything to be brought to our table!!!!!!  There was no apology or discount offered- last time I will go there"}
{"text":"Sushi here is pretty good. The ambiance in the restaint is pretty nice for being right next to a gas station, you wouldn't expect it. 

The only thing I have to complain about is I went in to get some take out, and there was like one other customer in the restraunt and it took like 15 minutes for me to get my sushi. I ordered very simple rolls. So it was a little irritating it took so long. 

Other than that I would go back."}
{"text":"Excellent service - very attentive and pleasant.  AYCE sushi and appetizers for $20.95 is a great price.  $3 Sapporo.  If you want AYCE nigiri, it is $4 extra. I took the advice of other yelpers and ordered some tried and true favorites.  I noticed that the Utah roll that many spoke of is not listed on the menu.  It's a special order roll that is made for regulars, but they happily made it for me on my first visit and included it in the AYCE price.  They warned that it was spicy, but I didn't find it to be - maybe they made the white girl version for me, not realizing that my palate can take the heat.

I was dining alone on a Wednesday night.  The place had light, but steady customer traffic.  They made me feel very welcome.  I really don't like it when I'm dining alone and the hostess and servers make you feel alienated because you're dining alone when they can't resist the urge to comment on your solo status - just you? ohhhh, and so on.  

The fish was fresh and the rolls were good, but I can't honestly say that they were great.  They could use more sauce and a dash of creativity and spice.  Don't be afraid to request extra sauce because it really did make a difference."}
{"text":"Good food but the worst service! I will never come back again. DO NOT COME! We asked for napkins 3 times. They messed up our order everytime. The staff could care less."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to post this but I had to. I been coming here for a while and always been happy when sitting at the bar.  Nice service and good food.  But today while at dinner i sat at a booth and ROACHES were everywhere.  At one point I saw three on the bench across from me.   My skin is still crawling.  Fix this problem ASAP."}
{"text":"I actually really liked The Sushi until lately as they took the crab out of their welcome salad and the servers have tried to upsell every chance they get. If you do go, the Pearl Special, Alaska Roll, I love Your Ass and 007 roles are the best. We usually sit up at the counter so we can watch the sushi chef in action. They are open seven days a week and are located right off the horizon ridge parkway entrance."}
{"text":"This restaurant is kind of hidden with the front of the restaurant facing the southbound off ramp of the 95 onto Horizon. I came here for lunch on a weekday and sat at the sushi bar. The restaurant, which has a more modern decor from other sushi places, was empty aside from two other patrons.

I ordered the sushi plate which comes with soup, salad, 6 pieces of nigiri, and a choice of roll which for me was the spicy yellowtail. No complaints with the nice portions of sushi. I should have put up the stop sign there, but I had room for a roll. By recommendation of the frequently visiting, borderline annoying, server I ordered the cucumber passion: tuna, salmon, yellowtail, crab, avocado, sprouts, wrapped with cucumber, with chef's special sauce on the side. I always enjoy watching the chefs skillfully cut the cucumber for these rolls. It was a tasty roll with the sauce adding a nice tang. Because the roll was light, without rice, I couldn't resist again and had to finish with a scoop of green tea ice cream.

I think The Sushi is OK but it wouldn't be my first choice for a la carte sushi. I'll come back if it's convenient to the location of where I am or maybe to try some cooked items."}
{"text":"If you like atmosphere, this is the place. If you like taste.... Well I would rather go to 808 tapas. Everything taste the same and I never been still hungry at a ayce."}
{"text":"I went at lunch. It wasn't busy so had excellent ambiance. Was greeted at door. I tried the rainbow rolls and eel nigiri. Both were excellent and at a price level you would expect from a mid-line sushi restaurant. The hostess/ waitress was very attentive so I didn't feel abandoned to my own devices. Next time I'm in Vegas I shall definitely return."}
{"text":"I had lunch at The Sushi today.  It was amazing.  The service was on point. My husband and I sat at the sushi bar, we each ordered all you can eat. Price is not bad at 21.95 PP.  I had 4 rolls he had 6 so it was worth the money.  I recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"This place has much more than just sushi, and they do it all well.  The atmosphere is quiet and pleasant, with a real Japanese feel.  There are tables, booths, and a sushi bar, so you can be seated in whatever area you like. They have accommodated special requests, and the service has always been attentive and friendly.  I particularly recommend the shrimp tempura and spicy tuna hand rolls.  And they have some VERY inventive names for their dishes!!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good sushi place... after trying 3 others in the area I FOUND IT! the muscles are yummy and all the sushi we had was great! Service is a little flaky. I found it strange that they dont allow you to order 1/2 rolls here."}
{"text":"I don't hit Summerlin much since it's the opposite side of town but the plan with the gf was sushi. We had plans for another place but we showed up and it was closed. 

Okay, let's try The Sushi across the street.   Clever name, by the way (NOT)! Once we get inside we realize it's not AYCE (minus one star). 

On the plus side the server was good about refilling drinks around closing time and the sushi chefs were awesome! Fat ass cuts of salmon or whatever your pleasure. Just didn't seem to be the freshest. Good spot overall."}
{"text":"This place is great. When we first watched in the place we were warmly greeted. Good atmosphere and they place good music. The sushi is fresh and so good! I got the 007 and the shrimp tempura and both were so great. Also when we walked in the guy working asked if we wanted him to change the channel. So nice! I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The rolls are great, 21.00 all you can eat, and they are so fast.  I love ordering a roll and getting it in minutes.  We always sit at the bar and have a great time."}
{"text":"The sushi is astonishing! I have been several times and never once been disappointed! The price is beyond reasonable for AYCE. Love this place! 

Starbucks/BlackJack/Cucumber Passion are must tries for the rolls that they make!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Henderson. Thick slices of sashimi and creative rolls. Cucumber passion is my favorite. No AYCE. Quality of rolls and friendly staff make it our regular go to."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from this place and was really excited to try it out after reading a couple of reviews. However once I got there with my girlfriend the experience I had was awful. 

First we get in and sit. Takes 5-8 minutes for the server to even think about getting drinks. We both get waters and it tastes like moldy water. After that I got the all you can eat with miso soup and \"Screaming 'O'\" and my girlfriend got the Spicy Ramen Soup as our first orders. 

When I got the miso soup it was lukewarm at best and really under seasoned. Then about 5 minutes later my girlfriend got her soup and it literally looked like water with 20 cent top ramen noodles in it with some curry powder, and tasted pretty much exactly like that. Then while she was eating I sat waiting for my order which didn't come until 20 minutes later after the waitress came to me and said \"Wait.. you ordered something didn't you...?\" and I told her yes 20 minutes ago. Needless to say I was upset especially since I got the AYCE and still got terrible service from the waitress. Before I even had a chance to say another order she stormed off. The dish was okay, decent tuna. 
Then I ordered the \"Fat Ass\" which is a fried roll with eel, crab, and tuna. It was completely over fried and all you could taste was tempura batter. 
After that I ordered the \"Red Dragon\" as my last roll and it was actually very good so that made me feel better about the overall experience of the place... but it didn't last. 
For dessert I got the Green Tea ice cream and it tasted exactly like Lemon Dawn dish soap. So fun end to the meal, she gave us our check at the same time as the ice cream and didn't even come to check on us for water refills or just general \"how was the meal\" type stuff. So I looked at the bill and left it there waiting for change for another 15 minutes while the staff, minus the sushi chefs, talked with each other ignoring my girlfriend and I completely the whole time so I just put close to the amount that I had in cash and left. 

There was so much more to complain about but it really isn't worth it. If I could give this place 0 stars I would but it gets 1 star simply because that \"Red Dragon\" roll was really tasty.

Overall though this place was a total hole, the service was trash, and the food was overpriced and mediocre. I won't be coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"Nice local all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant.  Variety of rolls and sashimi, cooked fish, tempura, katsu and appetizers.   Loved the salmon collar, screaming orgasm, shrimp tempura, pork katsu, cucumber-wrapped sushi, Saki choices and fast and attentive service."}
{"text":"A good Summerlin local Sushi place that you can eat at a reasonable price.  For an extra $5 you can have all-you-can-eat  Nigiri/Sashimi style (no rice).   I particularly liked the Salmon Collar which is not always available and the Cucumber Passion which is light and fresh tasting. The Salmon is roasted and wonderful tasting. Some of the sushi rolls I tried between three of us was OK at best.  Great service, fast delivery of food."}
{"text":"I used to love their prices and menu for all you can eat until after I ordered a garlic tuna, waited 15 min for the two pieces of sushi... I asked the waitress if they had forgotten it and she let me know that the chefs \"needed a cigarette\" and that's why it was taking so long to get my food to me.... WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK!? Never coming back. 
P.s this is the only review I've ever left on yelp if that says how fucked up it was"}
{"text":"Update:  Yelpers MUST be getting \"Naka Sushi\" confused with \"The Sushi\" when \"checking-in\".  They are both at Lake Mead/Rampart, but are across the street from each other.  This HAS to be the case, b/c THE SUSHI is immensely better in quality, service, and decor.  I have been to both and there is no comparison. 

This place is bar none THE BEST SUSHI SPOT in Las Vegas. We have tried Kabuki, Kobe, Sushi Mon, Sushi Fever, Oyshi, Goyemon, Sushi Kaya, Sushi Bomb and even the \"fine\" sushi establishment at the Wynn Hotel, just to name a few. And no one satisfies our sushi fix like THE SUSHI. What do we look for? 

1) Super fresh fish- check
2) Artfully crafted Rolls- check
3) Incredibly inviting/attentive staff- check
4) Beautiful decor- check

I equate all other sushi restaurants to \"wham bam, thank you ma'am, here's your fried rice cream-cheese fish concoction\" now give me your $25.
 
COME HERE and you will know and experience the difference. There's PRIDE in this restaurant. Something all the other spots have forgotten.

*I have taken A LOT of pics of the rolls here because I am always so impressed with their work. 
* I didn't mention how much they were ON PURPOSE. I always tip well, bc I feel guilty, considering the great experience I feel we get."}
{"text":"Average sushi place .. Nothing special in my opinion... I don't think the get busy enough to have the freshest fish so that's a big no no for me ... It's gotta be fresh or I don't return.. Unfortunately I won't be returning... :("}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Monday at 11am. The place had just opened. There were no other customers. Suddenly the lights went out. I heard screams from the back. The Sushi Chef started up a chainsaw and was coming our way, lit up only by the tiny jack-o-lantern hidden in his chef hat. The front doors were blocked by the waiter. There was no place to run, no place to hide.....

OK that didn't really happen, just a scary Halloween tale for the season. What did happen was a very nice lunch. I had a salmon roll and then the teriyaki salmon bento box. My friend went with Spicy Tuna roll and chicken teriyaki box.
Everything was very fresh, and tasted good. Similar to other places where I've ordered similar items. I wasn't wowed, but I was very happy with the portions and flavor for $9.95 salmon box and $5.50 salmon roll. Miso soup was pretty basic, definitely not the best I've had.

They have another location on my side of town that I didn't even know existed, near Lake Mead and Rampart. Will have to try it out. I didn't notice any drink specials but that doesn't mean they don't have one. 

I will go back, and sample a few more of their dishes. And if I hear a chainsaw start up, I hope it's just to trim up some of the tuna."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and decided to give it a try. The decor is nice and the waitress was very pleasant.  
We had the baked muscles and a few of the rolls.  The death valley, Cucumber roll, the daisy and fat ass were all very good.  
3 of us ate for 70.00 that encluded drinks, sushi and desert.  Was not disappointed and will be going back again."}
{"text":"zero complaints. Yes the service was a hair slow however we didnt care. Just enjoying the food and company"}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service!! Ordered take-out and it took 45 minutes to get our food and the manager \"Scott\" blamed my husband for not speaking up sooner after he admitted he himself wondered why my husband was waiting up front for so long. They don't care about customer service in the least, very rude and condescending."}
{"text":"My son and I love eating here. It's quiet, not like a lot of other places. The place is clean, the staff is friendly, and the sushi is outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"Funny names, but I'm not the sushi eater that goes for any cream cheese, imitation crab, or tempura rolls. Unfortunately that's pretty much every single roll they have here. 

Fish was fresh enough whenever I managed to get it, though it wasn't much. Getting nigiri sushi is an extra $5. 

The tofu was sour, which it definitely shouldn't' be. Made me wonder how many other ingredients had gone bad or were sitting around for a while but were still being fed to patrons."}
{"text":"If I could I would have gave them no stars but it's required to give a star so it be for our waitress . It took 35 minutes 3 orders of salmon , simple easy . The whole time that I watch the sushi chefs make sushi rolls but  they were too busy showboating for the people sitting up there and taking shots with them and ignoring the orders that were coming through. You could tell that one of the cooks we are not properly trained it was asking the other chef a ton of questions every time he looked at a ticket .  That scared me because if your a sushi chef you would figure you would know your menu ..?? Every time our waitress went and ask or just went up there looking for our sushi the two gentlemen that were behind there that were showboating kept basically playing the I don't know game or did you put it in game is really frustrating to watch everybody who sat after us get food before us as were all sitting there waiting for our food keep in mind  that we had a very small group of people of 3 .  Plus the place had maybe 5 tables ..None of this was brought to the attention of the manager until I had a request to talk to manager. The worst part is she offered to buy more beer but neither one of us was drinking second they already ran our card so wasn't like they were able to refund our card for the whole thing so we basically paid  $75 for maybe  three things of food never go back again I warn you is a horrible experience there are great sushi places like across the street in the Smith's parking lot!!"}
{"text":"Very decent place. Not the best, but it'll hit the spot. I also enjoy the names for their rolls. Very creative and funny."}
{"text":"I have eaten here for years and never had a bad roll. I love the screamin O its my favorite."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a good number of times. Heck, I've even had dinner here with my family for my graduation. The place has definitely changed in standards. The sushi doesn't taste good anymore and the prices have gone up for all you can eat. I remember when this place had good special's. I think this place is a little over rated now and I can find better prices for all you can eat in the Summerlin area. I rather take my Business across the street to naka sushi. Their way better!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was cozy & romantic here. I like getting away from the Strip, yet often that means it's hard to find the same quality.

The sushi was excellent and the service spot on."}
{"text":"New owner Nicco brought this spot to five star! Thank you Nicco for leaving Sushi fever and creating such a great new menu! This is my new favorite by far and so close tho home!  Love the JT special and the Red rock!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying my husband and I are sushi fanatics. G (my husband) is Japanese. He was born and raised in Japan. When he came to the US he thought he would leave sushi behind forever. During the 80s sushi bars began to spread throughout the country and my husband vowed he would eat at every single one of them. He started in CA and has eaten sushi across the country.  So, I thnk he's well qualified to recommend sushi bars. 

We recently retired and moved to this area. Not knowing our way around we took recommendations from people we met, as well as bought Groupons to try our different sushi places. We did not even consider stopping in at The Sushi.  What kind of place can it be with the name THE Sushi?  Plus, it's behind a gas station. Kind of a funky location.  The glass in front is blacked out so you can't see into the place. It just looked like a dive joint.  

There is a nail salon directly next door. One day while getting my nails done I called G and asked if he wanted to come by and meet for a quick dinner. (We live less than 5 mins away). As soon as we opened the door we were pleasantly surprised! The inside is very nicely decorated. The decor is modern and upscale. There is a large U shaped sushi bar right in the middle of the room with tables and chairs along the windows and walls. We usually sit at the bar, but choose a table since we were discussing some business that night. 

Our waitress was full Japanese. Although she did not speak Japanese to my husband you could tell its her first language. She was very nice, polite, and had a great sense of humor. She helped by making some suggestions. G always starts by ordering yellowtail nigri. He says that's how he judges a place. It arrived fresh and tender. We then ordered several rolls and an appetizer. The garlic edamame was enough for the both of us and seasoned just right. 

The menu is pretty entertaining with the rolls named funny and clever names. We laughed at them. The Sushi passed my husband's inspection and has become one of our favorite spots in the area. Highly recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"My man took me here for our 7th month anniversary and even though I've been spoiled by other AYCE places and their flexibility, the menu options this place offers definitely make up for it. The sushi was fresh, menu was creative and the k-pop music they had playing had me bopping my head as I fed my tummy. The service was a bit slow at the start but after we ordered, they were very attentive. A few things to keep in mind when doing AYCE here- 1) your sitting time is 60 mins; 2) you can only order half orders on your last orders; and 3) desert is limited to one choice.  At $25.95 per person its still not bad for dinner. I don't recommend the oysters. I really don't know why I keep trying to give fresh oysters a chance. Honestly the only good oysters I've had have been on the strip. Since this place is about 5 mins from our house, we will probably frequenting it more than our favorite spot as its a bit farther. (sadface) oh wells...As long as its good and fresh, I'm happy!"}
