{"text":"Went for lunch. Had the rare beef plus beef balls pho and the boyfriend had the tomato and crab meat noodles. 
Both bowls came steaming hot which was very nice (and rare!) but not sure if that's the reason why my rare beef came pretty well done. The soup is flavourful though! I didn't try the tomato and crab noodles, though my boyfriend said it tasted good. 
We sat at one of the booths, so it felt spacious inside the restaurant. Service was friendly. Would come back!"}
{"text":"They try to be a more modern and high end pho place and hence the charge slightly above average. The pho was average though and would recommend dropping by and trying it out if you haven't . If I'm craving pho around the area I would be back as well."}
{"text":"I've got to say props to them to having a full house when I came! Considering it's a place that didn't open too long ago, I was surprised.

I ordered a large rare beef pho (S-$7.50, L-$9.50), a small rare beef and beef brisket pho, and a chicken pad thai ($8.50). For pho, this place was quite pricey. The broth didn't have the usual pho flavour, and it actually tasted sort of bland. It wasn't pungent and did not leave me satisfied. Also, a large is not too big; although it comes out in a large bowl, there wasn't a lot of beef or noodles, just majority soup. The beef was already almost all cooked when it came, it was try and tough, and there was very little beef; so this was quite sad for a large. The beef brisket was also dry and tough, and was difficult to eat, couldn't bite it apart.
I originally wanted a beef stew, but they ran out of it- which was disappointing and a little bit questionable considering I went there at around 2 PM. What would happen when the dinner rush came in? I guess other people wanting to try the beef stew will be let down.

The pad thai wasn't bad, but nothing spectacular. It was also bland in comparison to other vietnamese restaurants. 

I liked that the food came very quickly after ordering.

On a side note, all the waiters and waitresses were very young; most likely university students. They should fix up their working attire because all the girls wore low neck clothing that didn't cover up very much; and I found this to be very inappropriate in a working environment. Their service wasn't too bad at least.

So overall, not a horrible place, but I won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"The soup was flavourless, the spring rolls seemed to have been heated in a microwave (they were blistering on the outside and still cold on the inside), and the presentation of the food was haphazard. The wait staff did not seem very friendly or well-trained, and delivered the wrong food twice while I was there. There are much, much better Vietnamese restaurants very close by (like right across the street, for example), so I don't see myself ever returning to this one."}
{"text":"attended the pre grand opening Saturday night here and everything was pretty decent.  From the food, the service, to the decor for the place, everything was handled very well.  as this was the pre opening, I will update this review at a later time to give a more accurate review on food and service.  

cheers!"}
{"text":"The reviews for this restaurant have been pretty bad so far so we were really wary about eating here, but we were pleasantly surprised by our meal. 

It was getting late for lunch but the restaurant was still fairly busy. The menu is pretty big with a thorough selection of pho, noodles and rice dishes. 

We ordered: 
- fresh rolls with shrimp and pork
- chef's special beef rice noodle soup
- spicy hue style noodle soup
- crab and shrimp noodle soup 

Everything we ordered were pretty good, and they definitely did not skimp out on the toppings for each noodle bowl. The prices here are also cheaper than the average Viet restaurant (especially when you take into account the amount of food you get). They don't automatically give you the sprouts though - they asked us if we wanted it first. 

Overall, not bad for a quick and inexpensive meal. Not really sure why this restaurant has such bad reviews."}
{"text":"Decent place with good food and service! The first time I went, it seemed disorganized and wait staff were scrambling all over the place but the second time it definately improved. The service is good and the staff are friendly. However, food takes a bit longer than average to arrive. Both times, I had gone for dinner so can't comment on going during lunch time. 

 They also offer a good variety of dishes. Ordered the C09, the crab soup, shrimp, tofu, and pork noodle soup and was pleasantly surprised by the flavourful dish. The portions seem smaller than average but for myself, I think it's a good size.

 Overall great atmosphere and would go back!"}
{"text":"Came here with high hopes, it's safe to say I was a little let down. 
Menu: 
I was seriously craving some Vermicelli with grilled chicken and spring rolls, but surprisingly they only had Vermicelli options with pork! (pork chop, pork sausage), so I settled for the Rare Beef Pho. 
One thing to point out about the menu is that small and large for every noodle with soup is the same which I found odd because usually the house noodle is more expensive because there's more stuff - so I felt like I was overpaying a bit! 

Service: 
We were seated promptly after taking a number. We had two kids and three adults, only three cups of tea were brought to us and the kids weren't offered water or anything. No one came around to refill the tea at any time and no tea pot was provided. We received our Rare Beef Pho's at a reasonable time.. but they forgot to give us utensils and we got 1 half wedge of lime for three large meals. Trying to tell the guy that we wanted small bowls for the kids and utensils as well as two extra lime wedges was funny... he didn't stay to listen to the rest of the sentence he ran to get whatever the first thing was. We had a red head waitress who wasn't very nice to be honest... no smiles and gave us a little eye roll when we spoke Cantonese to her... replied with \"Viet or English??\"

Decor: 
So nice!!!!! Beautiful inside. Would be good to play another channel other than CP24 and maybe a few chairs around the tiny bar would be cute, other than that it is gorgeous. 

FOOD: 
Noodles: great!!! Perfectly cooked and really delicious for dry noodles. 
Soup: Also great!! Tastes very authentic :) 
Beef: Was not rare at all was pretty dry and overcooked by the time it got to us... was really busy so it's okay. Beef was also really lean and thick compared to other places. 

Will return and update, overall decent, and probably the best in the area!"}
{"text":"Additional update on my favorite dishes plus one more STAR  - My favorite Bun Rieu-crab noodle soup. This soup is very hearty and great as it combines some of ingredients of tomatoes, tofu, and crab... very flavorful and addictive. 

Vietnamese Rare Beef and Beef Balls Noodle Soup or Chef's Special Pho. The combination of hot soup, beef balls, fresh herbs, lemon juice and chilli clears my head as it nourishes my body. 

Crispy chicken wings with special fish sauce, so flavorful, tender and authentic texture !!

Grilled Minced Shrimps on Sugar Cane, So Fresh, Flavorful and Delicious!!! One of the Must-try items on the food list.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here twice and both visits were disappointing. I last visited here on a monday for lunch to grab some pho and vermicelli. Staff was nice and prompt, and service was fast... really fast actually.. Literally, within 5 minutes of ordering my boyfriend received his order of pork with spring roll and vermicelli before i received my rare beef pho. To some, the SUPER fast service may seem really nice, but the taste, however, did not impress. Upon arrival, the spring roll was mildly hot, but quite soggy with oil (we thought his order was probably from a mistake from a previous order, that's why it was so fast?) and the pho was below satisfactory (was VERY light and watery, I couldn't taste the hearty beefy flavor that I loved in Pho). The two occasions we came here (on a weekend and a monday), we were not able to purchase bubble tea because they don't have tapioca... very disappointing but milkshakes sort of sufficed. 
Additionally, I did not particularly fancy the half handful of beans pouts and mint they served with my pho. (Asked for A LOT of extra sprouts and mint but they provided with the same amount as last time. It wasn't enough, but I couldn't be bothered to ask for more.)
Overall, interior was very clean. Probably one of the nicest looking pho places i've seen, but the food ranks as one of the blandest tasting Vietnamese places i've been to. Will I go back? Perhaps, but only if there is improvement in the taste factor and they ACTUALLY HAVE tapioca so i can order bubble tea."}
{"text":"Overall comment: Just OK, very average.

Pros: 

Interior is decent and clean.
Quick and polite services.
Easy to find a table.
Average priced.
Free WiFi.

Cons:

Both large and small Pho you get more soup then noodle. 
Soup feels a little too light.
Noodle was too soft.
Tables too close together."}
{"text":"First time here and Found a hair inside soup.  Disgusting!! Also, the food doesn't taste good at all"}
{"text":"nothing special.. tried the place for the first time and the food came fairly quickly, the service was accurate. I had ordered an avocado milkshake to go and I was shocked to find the cup was not filled fully, priced at 3.75 I was expecting a nice beverage to end my dining experience here but it seemed like the young lady that had made my shake was in a rush as to the shake was not blended properly (lots of ice chunks). it was disappointing. The dish I had ordered was the grilled chicken and pork chop with rice. The portions are decent but I find both meat were a little too dry, roughly burned especially on the edges. will come back again only to try the noodles next and ONLY the noodles."}
{"text":"Going out for Pho is a part of our regular restaurant rotation, so we were excited to try a new Pho restaurant in our area. 

Went here on an early Friday night and was greeted kindly by the staff.

We ordered the rare beef noodle soup and one of the chicken,  steamed egg, rice dishes.

Overall the food was on par with other offerings in the area. 

One thing that did stand out was the price of the food on the menu.  The price was slightly higher than other Pho restaurants in the area, and truthfully, in terms of food taste  there's nothing that separates this place from other places such as Kim Dinh or the newer Viet Kong in the area. 

The only advantage this place has is the lack of competition in area.  Within the vicinity the choices are slim pickings (I'm looking at you Pho 99.)

Positive:
Throughout the meal the staff would check up on our table asking if things were okay. This is a nice touch so hopefully they'll keep this service up. 

Others:
They mistook one of our orders but we're really keen on making the changes without too much hesitation. 

Overall if you are looking for consistent tasting Pho at a slightly higher price, this place will fill that void."}
{"text":"Should always trust Yelp.  Had the Large Pho Chefs Special.   It's a big bowl, but you might be sad when you look in the bowl  The little meat I did get was TOUGH.   The restaurant had cold air blowing on us.  Nice interior, thats the nicest thing I can stay."}
{"text":"Super disappointed! The pho broth was not flavourful, it just tasted like MSG soup. The spring rolls were so dry. Everything was really disappointing. I would never come back."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to visit this joint after reading the bashings of these so called \"Elite\" Yelpers. Sometimes, I wonder how much they know about the ethnic they are eating and the rambling abt street food in Vietnam and history lessons. Let's just say the bashings are a little harsh. Tried their rice dish (com tom) and pho. 

Are there room for improvements? Of course. The grilled chicken wasn't grilled right. The baked eggs was just alright. But it was BROKEN rice. That's authentic in my book. Some of the good authentic Viet resto around town don't even serve broken rice. But, it was a little to soft for my taste. 

The pho was fine. Not as flavourful as I would like, but not as bad as others suggested. If you live in Markham, it's as good as u can get. Of course, there are better broth around the GTA but you'll need to drive at least 20-30mins. It does the job if you live in the neighbourhood. 

Service was attentive and polite. Love the clean modern look. Compared to most Pho places, this place is fine dining. Did I mention the washroom is clean and not smelly?!? Expensive? It is more than others by about ~$1 per item. Really, it costs me $15 to drive to Sauga on premium gas for good Golden Turtle pho, plus 2 hours back and forth. You do the math! 

Definitely not great, but good in Markham and worth a try if you need a pho fix. And yes it is authentic!"}
{"text":"This review is based on how this restaurant fares with other Vietnamese / Pho restaurants in the area.

The design of the place is modern with a big screen TV at the bar. There seems to be a long line up during the dinner rush hour and we chose to seat on a 2 person table which was an oversight because we did not have that much space left for the food.

The food service size is pretty good and enough for at least one person. We ordered the grilled chicken and pork on rice, pad thai and the fresh spring roll with pork and shrimp. All were good but since this is Vietnamese, the pad thai in other Thais restaurants are better.

Also compared online on the menu prices and for the amount and quality of food, this is relatively lower priced than other pho places in the area.

Overall, we liked this place and we have been going here from time to time when we crave Vietnamese food. I also recommend this to my friends."}
{"text":"Place is nicely redone from the Harvey's previously there.  Went around 3:30 Monday, so place wasn't packed - had about 2 other tables occupied.  

We ordered the beef pho and the grilled pork bun.  The food came really quickly, which made me wonder if the food is already pre-made.

The beef pho - there was a lot of broth and little noodles.  The broth was a bit weak in flavor and could be hotter.  The beef was not raw as should be, but whitish looking and looked more like beef deli meat. The meat serving was very small.

The grilled pork bun - the pork had a good flavor.  This dish was not bad.

I will not return.  For what we got and the price, there are other places I would go to first."}
{"text":"The food at this place is actually not too bad.  Although the soup base seems a little too salty, so I suspect they were a little heavy on the msg.

Incidentally this place is one of those that actually hates serving customers.  The servers here enjoy doing their chores, like wiping tables, than taking orders from the paying customers.  

If it wasn't late I would have walked out immediately.  There was nothing more infuriating than to have to beg someone to take orders at a restaurant.  All the while they acknowledged my request twice, and yet kept on wiping the tables.  And the place was not even half full at the time.

Which is fine with me, cause this is the last time I eat here."}
{"text":"I won't go into the decor, nor the taste of the food there as Matt V and others have already summed it up quite well.


My family (2 adults and 1 child) was greeted by the host when we entered the establishment.  He asked how many of us, I said 3.  He told us that it would be 5-10 min wait for a table which was understandable as the place was quite full.  A party of 2 enters after us and this is where the issue starts:

About 5min into the wait, a party of 2 enters the establishment and tells the host they are a party for 2.  The host looks around and then asks if they would be willing to sit at the round table for 2 that are the taller type tables that you normally find at bars/clubs.  The male of the 2 said sure, that's fine.  So off they went to that table. 

I noticed people getting up to leave from a table that can seat 4, and overheard the female from the party of 2 (that was now seated at the taller table) ask if it would be OK to move to the table that seats 4.  I was surprised that the host said yes...

My question to the host was, why bother asking us how many people we are if you're not going to manage the table seating priority properly, what's the point?   He could not answer that.

Then a young lady co-worker came to his aid, and starts to help by saying: we seat people on a 1st come 1st serve basis.  My response to her was, yes, thanks we came here before that party of 2.

I'm fine that she came to his aid, but what she should've done is ask what the issue was before making her response.

Quick tip: To defuse the situation, clarify with your co-worker what the issue is, then assist the customer however you can.  Please do not assume or respond if you do not know the full background of the issue at hand.

At that point the host did apologize for his screw up, but the damage was already done.  

We got our table, and we ordered the B1 and B10, both of which were rather bland and really not worth the price they are charging.

Near the end of the meal, My wife overheard a party of 6 that were waiting for seating comment to the host \"you say we cannot sit here, and you say we cannot sit there, so where can we sit?\"  Looks like we were not the only people that were having issues with seating.

To the owners, I think you need to reassess your employee roles as at present course, it's not looking good."}
{"text":"I went with 2 friends about a week ago for lunch. 1 friend was very particular about her pho as she is more of a conisour then me. Me I'm not so picky, if it's decent I'll like it. My friends ate pho and I ate a tomato crab noodle soup. The noodles were fine as to be expected, nothing special. The rest of it, (in my opinion) the important stuff was a little below terrible. For the pho it looked fine, but it tasted like lightly salted water with a bit of grease on top. The service was a bit slow but they kept getting her order wrong. She asked for the beef slices to be on a separate plate but they put it in the bowl twice. As for my bowl, it was a similar story. Right look but super bad taste. It was like watered down tomato juice with a handful of meat and veggies. Yeah in short maybe pass on this one and eat at another pho shop just behind it. Or eat at a Harvey's."}
{"text":"Fairly new Pho place in Markham, a little pricey than the other Pho places around (small is around $7.59-$7.95) but the decor is a lot of modern and inviting. Visited there twice so far and both times had the special Pho noodle soup. The first time I went on a weekdaya when it wasn't too busy, the food was delicious. The second time I went on a weekend for lunch and it was super busy! Sat at the bar to avoid the wait, the soup tasted alot more watered down. I think the quality of the food is not as good when it's busy. It's a fairly new restaurant so just some kinks to work out until it runs more smoothly. Would definitely go back but probably avoid the busier times for now."}
{"text":"The new Pho Quinn restaurant really focused more on the aesthetic of the diner and food than the actual taste itself. The bone soup base for pho was extremely watered down. For a restaurant to name itself after the staple viet noodle dish, it was highly disappointing. I needed to drown it with Hoison, Hot sauce, and salt to even finish eating it. For anyone that has made pho before, it is a very tedious process and takes a long time. My palate was not pleased by this lacklustre attempt at making quality pho. It was almost like they used a flavour packet.

The service was terrible. There were a batch of what looked liked first year university girls with no experience running the whole floor. Understaffed. There were probably hired because of their looks and have no prior customer service experience. Management really needs to step up their game.

Tl;Dr: inside is beautiful. Service and food sucked. Don't recommend coming here until they show improvement."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time with the family starving, and looking forward to a great vermicelli meal ... and it was just OK.

Once we stepped in the place, it was busy! Which is impressive since they have been open for 3 weeks. It took a little moment until a nice waitress came to help us at the door. She made small but funny conversation with us. (BTW, the free wifi .. doesn't work.)

We sat down, poured tea & ordered food no problem. Everything was great UNTIL our food came. A family of 6 people are at the table and 2 meals arrived every 3-5 minutes apart, leaving us even more hungry and not really able to eat together. This is understandable and forgivable since only 1-2 waiters & waitresses are on the floor & 1-2 people carrying out the food. Heck, 5 people can be running this place! ... But still! 

I ordered D01, a vermicelli dish with beef and spring rolls, and the spring roll were so difficult to chew!!! It was a forgivable sized portion for almost $9! The beef had a weird taste, It was real meat for sure but it had a different taste & texture.

One of our other orders were missing spring rolls. Our waitress apologized and gave us a separate order of spring rolls which were chewable, (on some parts) and not bad. Damn springrolls man!

We ordered taro bubble tea, which had no ice, and hard tapioca. Disappointing!!



OVERALL, 
the service is great 10/10
but not the food! :( 4.5/10

No, I would not recommend anyone to go here on the regular. Try it out though! 
But if you want to discover cute girls in Markham that you've never seen before, be my guest!"}
{"text":"Nice and clean inside and staff were super nice.

I got the rare beef with tripe, and right away you could notice it's sooooo oily. Not only mine, but also my sisters. She also noticed how oily it was. Noodles were good, portions were good. My dad got pork chop which was too burnt for his liking, so he started to pick away at the burnt parts. One of the staff saw, apologized and offered us a pair of scissors. 

Overall, the taste of the food was mediocre other than the oil. Probably would come back, but definitely not a first choice."}
{"text":"This replaced the Harvey's that used to be here, and I have to say they've done some great work renovating the place.  This place is unusually busy for a weekday lunch, the staff are all young and very friendly.  

Glancing at the menu the food seems a bit more expensive (about a dollar or two more) than what i see at other pho places, which would not be a big deal at all if the quality reflected that.

This is not to say the food was terrible, it just didn't stand out at all.  Soup was okay, noodles were okay.  However, I've come to expect a flavourful soup from my pho and don't think it's worth the extra $1 or $2.

I've ordered a different appetizer the two times I came here - I've tried both the fried and regular spring rolls.  Again, they are passable but I may not be back again soon because i can likely find more bang for my buck elsewhere.  I'd be open to try again later on in the future and see if their quality has improved.

(The first time I was here one of our orders were forgotten entirely, but the staff apologized profusely and since they were such a new restaurant I have no problem overlooking that)"}
{"text":"So far so good.  The staff is nice but since the place is so new, there are definitely some things that need to be worked out.   Really glad to be eating pho out of real bowls and drinking out of glasses.  Hate the plastic bowls and cups at other places.  The decor is nice, clean.   The fresh shrimp rolls were very good and the soup for the pho was authentic."}
{"text":"Came here a few times already. We really like their vermicelli dishes. I also had the curry chicken and it was great! I couldn't stop drinking the soup, it was super flavourful and delicious- a must try. I never actually had their pho though, my dad did and wasn't a big fan of the type of beef and noodles they use. The broth was good though. I also had their chicken wings- nothing special but worth a try when they're 50%off (they have deals on certain days). Although I do agree with some of the other reviews, there may be a language barrier at times, but service is definitely friendly. Overall I will keep returning to this place :)"}
{"text":"Place was very clean when I went. Service is slow, and it is hard to get the waitress's attention. My mom asked the waitress what her recommendations were from the menu, and the waitress replied that she does not eat meat and wouldn't give any suggestions. She was not very friendly.

My mom ended up ordering the stirfried rice noodles and she liked it a lot. I ordered the chef's special pho. I thought it was pretty average, no complaints here. We also ordered vegetarian spring rolls, one order has 6 spring rolls instead of 2 since it is vegetarian.

I will be coming back since its so close to Markville Mall!"}
{"text":"Came here because we had a craving for pho and didn't want to drive all the way down to our usual spot. So why not try out a local spot right? Service was ok, nothing amazing. Ordered the pho dac biet (house special) with an avocado shake. Food took a while, which is weird cause all they really do is put the toppings on top of the pho and then pour soup on top...
I always try the soup first, and this is probably the worst soup base I ever tried. All I tasted was liquorice...they added wayyyyy too much star anise in the base. I couldn't even eat it. This is actually the first time not finishing a bowl of pho. Extremely disappointed. The avocado shake was also meh, a bit too much ice in mine, didn't really taste like a milkshake. Never coming back again. :("}
{"text":"I haven't found a really great tasting pho in Markham yet until I came to this place. I've seen it a bunch of times but never thought to come in because it didn't have that old school pho look with a cow on it lol. In my experience those are usually the most legit. 

We ordered one pho with regular broth and one pho with rare beef, tendon and tripe but switched the soup to bun Bo hue spicy soup. Best. Decision. Ever. The soup was super flavorful and noodles and beef were cooked to perfection. It was both aromatic and savory. Make sure to try the bun Bo hue broth if you are a spice fiend - it offers a seafood based broth with a nice kick of spice! The regular broth was fine; not the most memorable but passable to fix a pho craving.  

The staff were extremely accommodating and friendly when making any substitutions and gave us extra basil, chili peppers and any other condiments we asked for speedily. The pho came out within 5 - 7 minutes as well. 

This is definitely my new go to place for pho in the markham area !! Especially when the service is so warm and welcoming !"}
{"text":"I was thrilled when a new pho place opened up in Markham. After tasting the menu, my enthusiasm diluted a little but am still happy it's close by. I started with fresh spring rolls with shrimp and beef and was pleased to see that they didn't skimp on the size. Next my rare beef pho actually had rare beef! A fair serving of meat, firm noodles and a weakly aromatic broth will have me coming back if I'm in the mood for a quick Viet meal. Just like the Harvey's it replaced, it's a decent restaurant, fairly price, but don't expect a prime rib when you're in a burger joint."}
{"text":"Had the bun rieu here and honestly it was probably the worst that I've ever had. The tomatoes aren't even fresh, you can tell they are canned tomatoes. Will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been passing by this restaurant a lot and finally went to try it. It's quite a spacious restaurant. We were greeted as soon as we entered and were seated.

I tried their pho, grilled beef vermicelli, and curry beef rice. I also tried their tri colour ice drink (mung bean, red bean, green jelly). Both the pho and curry beef rice were a bit on the saltier end. The taste wasn't anything spectacular either. Although the portions were decent, it wasn't something that I would go for again. The grilled beef vermicelli had a lot of beef which was good, but the overall was too sweet. I usually pour the whole bowl of sauce that comes with it in and it's a decent sweetness, but this sauce was way too sweet which made the whole dish not very good (I am someone who enjoys foods on the sweeter side and this was too much for me).

The tri colour ice drink was your typical cup size so again, it was a decent size.

The pair of chopsticks I was given was also sticky. I waited a while trying to call the waitress to switch to a new pair but there was no one around (even though it was just my table and 2 others in the restaurant). I walked up to the waitress and asked for a new pair of chopsticks. She was friendly about it and gave me a new pair. 

They have decently sized portions which is good. I may return, but this is not a first choice restaurant that will be calling for me."}
{"text":"Aside from convenience, there's nothing much here. Came in around 1pm on Saturday and they were seriously short staffed as it was a full house. Kids were running around - kind of dangerous if you ask me as servers carried huge bowls of hot pho noodles around.

The pho noodle bowls come in two sizes - small and large. A large bowl is comparable an extra large bowl at some other places I've been to, such as Golden Turtle Kitchener, Golden Turtle Mississauga, and Pho Dau Bo Kitchener. The price was comparable, but the soup was not tasty and the toppings were skimpy. The bean sprouts were short (read: broken...did they snap off the wilting parts?) and the fresh basil was not looking good-I would cook with it say if I was throwing it into soup or chopping up, but not to present as \"fresh\" leaves or as garnish.

The lemongrass pork rice looked alright - nothing special in taste.

The three colour ice looked promising when served, but a closer look reveals an odd teal coloured grass jelly instead of the typical bright green, and instead of thin strip shapes they had an odd zigzag block shape...kind of like Ruffles chips and Lego blocks combined into a jello colour. Once I mixed it altogether the real problem arose-there was tons of space between the toppings and my glass was far from full - it was mostly just ice! It tasted alright I guess.

Would try something else in the plaza next time probably. Other than convenience and nothing especially bad - not much going for the place."}
{"text":"Pho is good with a flavourful broth! Restaurant is decently big with friendly staff members. As for the environment, it is relaxing, not too loud and decently clean. There is a seating area and a bar section. I would say this location is somewhat better than many other pho places I've been to but food wise, taste average with the price slightly higher than other locations."}
{"text":"I really like this Pho place. Although I usually opt for the vermicelli with grilled pork sausage, which I really enjoy. The portions are generous and I find the service is always quick and efficient.

The grilled pork sausage was very flavourful and juicy and the grill pork tasted great.

Overall one of my go to places when I'm in the area and in the mood for viet food!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! We go a couple times a month usually. I always have the same dish when I go! I get the large Pho with grilled chicken on the side. It's a Griswold favourite especially on cold winter days. A big bowl of soup with noodles is fine by me! The chicken is grilled right, mine always comes with no skin which I like. The soup is tasty, hot and soothing. I love the raw bean sprouts to add to the soup. I usually add a good helping of sriracha and hoisin sauce to the broth for taste. The staff are great here. This is a great place for Pho. Great prices too!"}
{"text":"My actual rating is 2.5 stars. 
This restaurant deserves a PASS because of they handle their mistake professionally. I am feeling positive that they will improve their overall quality.  What happened? Let me share my experience:

 I came to an early dinner with family on a Saturday.

I ordered vegetable soup noodle from the menu. You would imagine this is a 100% vegetable item. However it came in with non veggie soup base.  The server was new and didn't ask or double check the option of soup base.  Based on my last visit one month ago, this item came in a vegetarian soup base.   So this time you would think this item assumed to be consistently same and standardized . 
Now the soup base came this time it was used was beef broth and I had to ask if this is right.  The manager/owner came to our table and apologized it was their server' mistake and understood the reluctance when the server took the order.  I appreciate the owner attitude and how well she was handling this concern.  She mentions she will remind the new staff and ensure that the vegetarian order always requires to ask the customer's preferences of their soup base.
To be asked and to check are both sides I believe as a diner . A lesson is to take home with. 
Eating is absolutely personal to different preferential eaters like us, who may be religious or vegan or vegetarian etc.  At the end of our conversation, we both agree that this is absolutely important for the server to double check with customers when placing vegetarian items. 

The positive consequence is that at the end of the dinner, she gave us 10% discount on our bill as to honour their mistake and thank you us for coming repeatedly. She was thankful we brought up to her attention regards to order process and problem from her newly hired staff. Hopefully we will be back with better order process.

Overall the experience was positive."}
{"text":"The staff are nice, but food is mediocre. The pho barely has any flavour and the portions are small for how much they charge. They charge about $1 to $2 more per dish compared to other (better) pho places.

Not only did the waitress get one of our orders wrong, she charged us wrong on something else too. Since the service was already slow, we decided to just pay the extra charge and leave very little in tips.

P.S. Someone mentioned that this is one of the better pho places uptown, but I disagree. Read my review for Vic Hong (at Major Mac & Bayview) if you want to try a better Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Really busy place.  Decent decor and cleanliness for a Pho place.

I had the Pork, Sausage and Spring Roll Bun which tasted fine but was a bit disappointed it wasn't grilled pork.

The regulars all seemed happy here, and there was a lot of them too for on a weekend.  Staff looked like they knew most of the customers by name.

A solid A-OK."}
{"text":"The owners are actually vietmanese (although they speak cantonese) so the place is quite authentic. I've tried their pho and vermicelli bun, and both were great! The drinks are good as well (we had the sam sek bing and mango slush) and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I was about to give this place 5 stars but the only downfall to this restaurant is that the bean sprouts and mint doesn't come with the pho you order, it needs to be asked.  

It's too bad to hear about the low ratings and it was originally what kept us from giving this place a try.  One night my husband took my family here and they were all blown away by the place.  All 5 of them ordered rice dishes and they all loved it. 

-The BBQ meats (rice dish) were all very delicious and flavourful with a good amount of smoky charcoal taste

-The portions are very generous

-Bun Rieu very authentic

-Bun bo hue authentic and good spicy hot

-Curry chicken vermicelli was the absolute BEST that my family and I have ever had in GTA.  It was very authentic and a must try

The last thing was the fantastic service we got and it sucks to hear many others didn't receive the same.  Our waiter was very nice, friendly and chatty with us making jokes with my husband too.  Perhaps we are a very easy going and friendly family to begin with so the law of attraction, you get what energy vibe you exert.  We brought our 10 months old baby there and our waiter even brought us a pair of scissor so we can cut her food without even asking, plus the bowl and baby spoon.  Come on, what else can I ask for??  He was very prompt, our food came surpise fly fast on a Saturday and Sunday dinner and lunch.  

Definitely will be returning again with my family."}
{"text":"I've been doing a lot of work in the surrounding area , as a result, I've been coming to this fantastic pho restaurant to satisfy my craving over the past week. I've now officially been here 4 times as of July 26th; that being said, I'm completely shocked at the reviews and how low they are and urge anyone who's had a bad experience here in the past to come back and give this place another shot. I try not to hand out 5 stars unless truly deserved, I feel like this place has done more than that. Not only is the kitchen spotless, I know this because we did maintenance work on it, the food is always fresh and the store is usually quite busy from 1030am, when they open, all the way through to the afternoon. I've tried a number of dishes with my crew, the house special chicken fried rice with vegetables is one of the best I've tried, but my go to, as usual is the b02, or rare beef pho. The broth is perfect, not too salty. I'll definitely be coming here more often to satisfy my pho craving. John the manager is always very friendly and extremely helpful. I'm very pleased with the staff. Keep it up pho Quinn!"}
{"text":"Went here a few times each time was horrible. First time found plastic in my pho. The second the waitress tried to refuse my group from sitting at a booth and made a huge fuss about bringing my group and I new clean chopsticks. She acted extremely childish storming around the place and slamming things on our table. I refuse to ever eat here again, the service is disgustingly poor and food is even worse. The pho isn't even made with a broth it's a basic chicken or beef stock lacking flavour. I would not recommend this place to anyone. If your looking for actually good pho made and served with love them check out Pho Vuon Lai Jasmine Garden located at 250 Alton Towers Circle, Unit C6, Scarborough. It may be a bit farther but it's well worth the drive the quality of food and service far surpasses what you will get at pho quinn"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today.  Having seen the various reviews, I wasn't expecting great food. 

I ordered the small special pho.  It is a decent size, with the thin dry noodles, that I prefer.  Toppings were good too.  Real standout was the tripe and tendons.  Tendons were not slimy and too soft, still had a bite and hard texture.  Tripe was fantastic, if you like it not overly bleached, like most tripe.  Still had some colour, bite and had some of the beef offal taste to it.  I thought the bowl was of a good size and quality.

Then why the low rating? Well it was the service.  The owners were both waiting tables with 1 lone, not very experienced waiter.  The noodles took 15 minutes to come, I've never waited that long for a bowl of pho before.  What pissed me off was the table next to us knew the owner, so he ordered after us but got his bowl in 5 minutes.  We asked for the bill and it never came, had to ask a second time.  The worst was when we left, the owner just blatantly stared at us, I was expecting him to acknowledge us and say bye or thankyou but he never did.  I love to support local family owned places, the food ain't always the best but you feel welcome and appreciated.  

Good luck staying in business with just your \"friends\", I for one will never come back again."}
{"text":"I really like the food here and it's not too pricey. 

Service during night or extra busy hours is bad though. Possibly there aren't enough workers or something. When it's not too busy definitely 4 stars"}
{"text":"Came here many times with my boyfriend and his parents. I like trying the different noodles in the menu, each time i go there. The menu has a lot to choose from. I love their butter, fried chicken wings. Their chicken wings are different and unique. It's different from other Pho places. They have quick service. The servers are nice, and friendly. Yes, I would recommend place."}
{"text":"Pho Quinn is a restaurant that provides a wide selection of Vietnamese cuisine. Located near the intersection of Hwy 7 and McCowan, in the plaza behind Kitchen M.

Food: 3.5/5
Whenever I go to any pho restaurant, I'll almost always order the Pho Dac Biet (beef tendon, tripe, brisket, rare beef, meatballs, onions). The broth here is average compared to many other pho places, and doesn't have the deep flavour only achieved by simmering the broth for hours. However, the broth is clean and clear, which is a good thing. Usually not satisfied with the broth, I'll add a small amount of hoisin and sriracha to it to give it more flavour. Portions are generous, and I always get asked whether I want my bean sprouts or basil cooked/fresh. Overall, the pho does well in satisfying cravings, but doesn't leave any awestruck impressions.

Decor:
A very modern and casual setting, feels very welcome with ordinary noise levels. A great place to go with a small group of friends. The design of their menu is simple and clean.

Is it worth it?
Yes. The pho is decent in quality, matching well with the price you pay (totals around ~$11 for a large). Although not very impressive, it will satisfy your pho cravings and leave you full. I come here occasionally and I've never really had a bad experience with this place; the bad reviews of this place could happen to be unlucky timings. In general, just a very average place."}
{"text":"Me and my son went there. The manger/owner is extremely rude. Me and my 8 year old ends leaving that store eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Pho Quinn is the newer restaurants in this plaza and replaced the spot where Harveys used to be.

Walking into the restaurant, we were greeted quickly and seated almost right away. The tables and seats were very close together and the table beside you is about 25 centimeters away. The waiters speak English, and I believe the one who took our order speaks Chinese.

As this is a Vietnamese restaurant, I always start out by trying their pho. Pho Quinn serves pho in size small and large, small being $7.50 and large being $9.50. We got the Chef's Special Beef Rice Noodle Soup, size large. We also got the grilled chicken with rice for $7.95. 

We didnt' wait too long for the pho, and if you have been reading my reviews for Vietnamese food, the temperature of the soup and how fresh the noodles are, makes a HUGE difference when deciding how good the place is. Unfortunately, the soup wasn't as hot as expected, nor were the noodles the fresh ones, but it tasted like they were packaged. 

The grilled chicken with rice wasn't anything too special either.

I think the price is slightly expensive for a mediocre place with average sized portions."}
{"text":"MSG !!!! Ugh. Sooo much of it. We ordered the beef balls and rare beef pho and the phuk kein noodle. Portions were ok.... but a tad pricey.  The soup was loaded with msg. Definitely not returning."}
{"text":"A little more expensive than other pho places ($7.5 small & $9.5 large) .... but the broth is richer and the meat came out raw so it was super fresh and cooked in the soup like its supposed to."}
{"text":"Pho Quinn's decor is quite nice for a Viet restaurant in this area. Their grilled chicken on rice was delicious lots of lemon grass flavour. Ordered their drip ice coffee super strong and yummy. They have more Vietnamese noodle variety then just pho like seafood/ pork on egg / glass noodle. Would definitely come back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"My family and I love going to pho places so when my aunt recommended this one, we went to try it out for dinner after a long day.  I have to admit that I'm pretty surprised that this place has such low reviews.  As I checked in on Yelp at the beginning of our stay, I was a bit wary while I ordered due to the low ratings but, nevertheless, we ordered as we would have anywhere else and we were not disappointed - maybe they're aware of the low reviews and stepped up their game that night or maybe it depends on when you go that the food turns out good or bad. In our case - it was pretty good!

We ordered two orders of spring rolls ($3.95 per order for 2 rolls - crispy fried rice paper rolls w/ shrimp & pork, veggies, & taro) to start - they were pretty good - the sauce needed a bit more flavour but the rolls were cooked nicely. We had the large size chef's special beef rice noodle soup ($9.50; S - $7.50 ... there's no in-between size though) which had brisket, flank, & beef tendon, tripe, & beef balls. When you first get the soup it looks like there's almost no noodles but it's hidden under the meat and other ingredients - stir it up and the large bowl of soup was enough for our group of four (but if you come here just for the pho on empty stomachs, the large is good enough for two).  Broth was pretty good - average but I'd eat it again if I came by. 

We also ordered stir-fried chicken in lemon grass w/ vermicelli which was good - not our fave dish of the night though - something was missing to round out the flavours($8.95). Our favourite dish was the grilled pork chop with rice ($8.95) - marinated with a sweet flavour and cooked well, I recommend this one over the chicken vermicelli dish. 

Overall, Pho Quinn is a good place for Vietnamese cuisine - service was friendly, quick, and frequent to ask how we were doing and the ambience is clean and modern. While the food isn't amazing, I'd say it's average or even a bit above and worth a try."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday evening, short on time, lots of restaurants packed, and famished while in the area so I figured it would be a good idea to eat here/ at a Vietnamese restaurant. 

This review is strictly for one item on their menu;  the grilled pork chop and chicken with rice which is always my go to dish at any Vietnamese restaurant. I have never been crazy about pho and it seem like the pho is just okay here so it seems I made a good decision. 

I must admit that the dish was pretty good! But then again, I have never been disappointed by this staple anywhere. The portions of everything were very generous, plenty of delicious rice, pork chop and chicken. The rice was fragrant and nutty while the pork chop was flavourful. The meats were grilled well and the cut were lean (and that's the way I like it!) 

The service here was rather poor, there were only two people here servicing the entire place. There was a device to call service but I don't know if it works.. We waited a while to order and while we flagged the attention of someone but he decided to do other things and left us attended until we had to flag someone else down. After we finished our food quickly (we were starving) and we were essentially given the bill. I would have liked to enjoy some more time talking with my friends but we needed to go anyways."}
{"text":"Got in restaurant. No one greeted us or told us it would be a minute or so. Waited five or more minutes. No one. We walked out. Left our vehicle parked just in front and walked a distance to another local restaurant. You don't leave patrons waiting. I wish it was still the old Harvey's. *SIGH*"}
{"text":"It's very hard to differentiate vietnamese restaurants from one another but this one does in a not-so-good way. 

Rather than getting into the details, I'll just say the average rating this place received thus far is pretty on point. The spicy curry chicken noodle in soup wasn't that great... Tasted like braised chicken left in my fridge for days. 

Also wifey, usually orders the bun (grilled meats on vermicelli) but it was very lacklustre here. Typically the meat comes hot off the grill with nice searing and hints of lemograss from the viet joint by our house, but at this place it's old, probably pre cooked and reheated for guests. 

Also, we received a surprise gift in our spring roll: butcher's twine. Yup, lucky us... Instead of offering to take it off our bill, they made a new one thinking we still had an appetite for spring rolls :/

You'll definitely need to change the food quality if you want guests to return. Freshness and proper food handling preparations need to be improved."}
{"text":"Decent food but has gotten progressively worse in the last 6 months.   Portions are smaller with less meat and even broth doesn't taste as good as it used to."}
{"text":"Pho is considered a fast food in Vietnam.  Like the hamburger, one can order this delicious bowl of beef noodle soup and receive it within 5 minutes or less.  The establishments in Vietnam would specialize in nothing else but this dish, working in very minimalistic kitchens, often exposed to the open air to let the savoury aroma do all the advertising to bring in their customers, because a pho joint can be found literally on any street corner in the major cities of Vietnam!

So how is it in a modern, proper Western kitchen can anyone screw up pho like Pho Quinn did?

I was nicely greeted by their very young staff members one weekday afternoon for lunch, looked to be 1st or 2nd year university students. (Wait, don't they have school?) I was situated in the corner which had a tremendous cool draft going, so much so that I kept my warm winter jacket on.  It was still -3 celcius outside and the restaurant felt almost like being outdoors if not for the humidity. 

One quick perusal of the menu, (in Cantonese, Vietnamese and English) and I settled for the large bowl of rare, well cooked and tendon beef.  I also ordered a side of the famous iced Vietnamese condensed milk coffee.

Within 10 minutes my coffee arrived, and it would be another 10 minutes for my pho to come out. (20 minutes for one large bowl of pho, not a good omen.)  There was actually another patron who sat down 5 minutes after me and he somehow received his pho well ahead of me.  Not another good sign.

The place wasn't packed or brimmed with customers, I counted about 15 patrons in total during a late afternoon 2:30pm lunch. 

This is my experience with the pho:

- soup was clear, but very bland
- strong cinnamon and star anise after taste in the broth, a clear sign of broth not cooked long enough to bring out the beef flavors from the oxtail, beef bones, etc.
- only 4 pieces of \"rare\" beef which were clearly pre-cooked
- 3 pieces of well cooked beef
- 1 large piece of beef tendon
- minimal garnish, barely a handful in the broth
- thin pho noodles were cooked adequately

- side dishes next to non-existent, a tiny clove of basil on top of a lot of bean sprouts with 2 small wedges of lime
- when asked for more (wild coriander, basil, mint, peppers) I was given 4 more small cloves of basil in a bowl. (See my photo for reference.)

The coffee didn't fare any better:

- bland, watered down. Barely any of the bitter coffee taste, a trademark of the Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk.
- condensed milk tasted off like sweetened powdered milk, like the ones you get with bubble tea.  It's suppose to be overly sweet and overpowering. 
- opened the slow drip lid to reveal barely a teaspoon of grounded coffee was used, they clearly cheapened out tremendously.  It didn't even fill barely half of my glass for the coffee.  (The coffee was $3.75 on the menu!) See my photo for reference.

Pho Quinn failed for me in every aspect. Service was slow, the food not up to par, how can you claim \"authentic Vietnamese cuisine\" on your menu when the staple of your name (the pho) comes nowhere near close what an authentic experience is suppose to be?  

For $9.75 for a large bowl, I expected more.  The owners are definitely cheapening out, over charging for what I received.   The decor was - well, with its wood accents and warm colors. Maybe more attention was given to the ambience, and not so much the food and overall value, which to me, seem like an after thought.

I never, ever do this but what I'm about to do is recommend OTHER pho restaurants to go to for the true, 100% authentic Vietnamese experience.  If I get enough flak for doing this, I may remove this part of my review:

(In order of best, good and OK)

1) Pho Tien Thanh in Toronto
2) Golden Turtle (both in Toronto and Mississauga)
3) Pho Linh in Toronto
4) Pho Viet Express in Vaughan
5) Pho 88 in Scarborough

Moving on, unless Pho Quinn is willing to change, I cannot foresee myself returning nor recommending this place to anyone. Ever. 

Pho Quinn clearly has a basic understanding of Vietnamese cuisine,  they just need to increase the value in what they are charging their patrons.  More meat in the pho, more flavors, more side dishes, way way more grounded coffee used.

Also, giving us more than just ONE piece of napkins would also help.  Train your staff to be more familiar with the menu, I saw one waitress return twice to a patron to double check on what he ordered. Did she not write it down?!?

Hell, I'll even offer my consultation services as a Vietnamese national on what makes a great bowl of pho for FREE! Seriously, if the owners are reading this, drop me a line."}
{"text":"Good enough pho for Markham. Small portion was rather appropriate for a light meal. Broth is light and nice (a little watery but the clean flavor comes through for me). Ambience isn't bad in the restaurant either.

Edit - experienced food poisoning later on. Might have been due my experience here as my family didn't have anything similar to my stomach pain."}
{"text":"Still short on staff. Waited 20 minutes to place an order. My next guess is when does my food arrive? Such a shame since they give generous portions on the grilled chicken."}
{"text":"Service is pretty good here. On my visit, it was the owner and two girls who looked maybe just out of university kind of age on staff. They weren't very helpful with recommendations, but they were very kind, informative, and checked up on us very often. Courteous and patient. They were also very attentive to their tables needs.

The food is, honestly, not fantastic. I have had better Viet food. Infact there's a pretty good one just next door. But let's not be harsh. It isn't like the food tastes bad. It might not be the most authentic tasting but it's not like you couldn't possibly enjoy yourself. The food is good.

The pho broth probably needs more time to simmer for better flavoring. And the bun needs more work over all. Their grilled meats are well done. Definitely off the grill flavor which I like. Is it consistent though? I'm not sure. But my visit was pleasant. 

If ever in doubt of reviews, it doesn't hurt to just try it out once yourself."}
{"text":"Okay pho Quinn is fuckin bad. Lol bad puns for a bad place to pick up some pho.

Honestly the food is nThere is an issue with the noodle to beef to price ratios 10 bucks for a large and the amount of noodles would barely feed your"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic viet food!! One of my favourite places to eat pho in markham!! Efficient and great customer service!! Definitely recommend a try!!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout and pho by itself was ok. I asked for no onions and green onions, they included it in the broth. I also ordered the spring rolls and I received two pieces, but they were uncut. Also wasn't given any dipping sauce for them. Pho craving was left unsatisfied.  =\"}
{"text":"Nice looking place you can see it right off highway 7 in the same plaza as Congee Queen, Ithaca, and the other places. It's also directly east of Markville mall so it's an option, before or after shopping. 

The sign says authentic Vietnamese cuisine so I thought I'd give it a shot. 

Atmosphere:

It seems this place recently received a renovation as it looks quite clean and nice. Not a greasy spoon type like pho 99 next door. Lots if table space. 

The pho though was meh at best in my honest opinion. 

Food: the pho is always what I order. I know it's not the only Vietnamese dish but it's definitely my favourite, especially the house special. Two issues I had with it, while the broth was light tasting it barely had any meat or noodles to go with it. 

My biggest problem, and this probably is because there really is no standard in sizing when it comes to pho is that they only offer a small and large size. I've had a large size all around the area and large usually means youve eaten nothing all day and this will fill you up. The large here is essentially a medium or small medium at nearly other places. It's not as big as you'd expect. It also is a $2.50 price difference which hits you in the wallet a little bit. 

Wife had the pad Thai and it was \"mushy\", too saucey and a red colour. It wasn't the brown colour you'd usually see. 

All in all a place that looks great and has food to eat, but if you have a few minutes then drive down to Scarborough or go west to a place like Pho Metro for better value and on my opinion better tasting food."}
{"text":"I went this place three times. First time was 3/5. Second time was 2/5 . Third time 3.5/5 
Overall the food portion is small (all kinds of dishes ) I tried pho , PadThai , curry chicken . They were too salty and not tasty . There was no flavour but salty. If this is the authenticity of viet food , I probably wouldn't enjoy it . I am not sure why this restaurant has such high rating about food quality. I tried to give three chances for this restaurant yet I am still not satisfied with the food 

The only thing I give better rating is the service as I see it has improved . 
Service wise, the first and second time was worst. As the server was not nice when I brought in stroller and asked me to take away the stroller. Also didn't feel welcomed when they served the food . 
The third time I went it has much improved. Server was nice and putt effort to serve us well especially my kids. So service was great the third time . 

But still I don't recommend to go due to food quality and portion."}
{"text":"I was fairly excited to try this new Vietnamese Pho restaurant because it's close enough to where I live.  However I was sorely disappointed with the whole experience. First off, I don't think they have enough wait staff as we had to wait around 5 minutes to be seated despite 4 tables that were open but have yet to be cleaned up. I ordered a Chef Special Pho noodle soup and my wife a rare beef. All the meat (beef) was very tough, including the tripe and tendon that was included in my soup. The broth was bland as well. Overall, food quality was poor so I won't be back. Compared to a place like Vietnam Noodle Star in Scarborough, this place doesn't have a leg to stand on."}
{"text":"5 stars for their service.  I was happy a new pho restaurant opened up in Markham but was so disappointed in the food when I tried it. The food was tasteless and horrible. Prices are quite high for the food they give. Cheap on the meat (expect to leave hungry) and the pho was not authentic. It tasted like plain hot water. If you know anything about Vietnamese food then you know you will not come back here a second time. I end up driving down to Markham and finch right after to Pho Lac Vien. Way better!"}
{"text":"Got a summer role and pho chicken to try this new one . 
Decoration looks good   . Friendly staff but food didn't win me over. Summer role was not fresh . And pho was not taste good . Just lots of nodels and very oili and greasy soup. 

I'll give it a try after few months to see some improvement ."}
{"text":"I ordered a small Raw Beef Pho, #B02.  There was lots of raw beef.  The noodle was thin and smooth.  The broth was strange:  it was flavourful, with a hint of MSG, when it arrived.  I added many raw bean sprouts before consumption.  Around 2/3 through the noodle, the broth became so diluted (from bean sprouts, seriously?) that it tasted bland.  My BF found the change very strange.  

I liked that the decoration was nice.  I could ponder having dinner here.  This pro was offset by the fact that the bean sprouts and mint leaves didn't arrive with the pho.  I had to request it.  The waiter made a second trip to kitchen to get garnishment.  I wonder if the garnishment was available upon request only, or if it was provided automatically like other pho places."}
{"text":"Purchased take out and the large rare beef noodle only had 4 pieces of thin beef and the small only had 3! Very disappointed as we paid over $30 for a small and 2 large for family of 3 and we are all still pretty hungry after! 
I posted pics in the gallery. What a rip off."}
{"text":"Place was busy for a Monday afternoon but it was Easter Monday. 

(D08) Vermicelli with spring roll and sausage $8.95
(D06) Vermicelli with spring roll, sausage, grilled pork $9.50
(A03) Shrimp veggie wrap $3.95

This has got to be one of healthiest meals I have eaten at a restaurant in a while. All the above dishes had alot of fresh veggies. Everything tasted good and fresh. 

Service suffered a bit when it got busy.

Since its so close to home I'm sure I will be back to try the pho."}
{"text":"Never tried this place before and won't be coming back again!  The decor seemed too nice for viet place.  The pho was lacking, with little beef and not so tasty broth.  Everything we got was subpar and will not be returning"}
{"text":"3.5/5

There's still some kinks to work out for this restaurant, but it's definitely a decent pho place, at least for Markham standards.

When I arrived at around 9pm last night, the place was actually quite busy; I say around 3/4 full. Most of the staff outside are teenagers/young adults who don't seem to be much older than me (I'm 24). I can understand them trying especially since it's a new business, but they're trying too hard to achieve good customer service (e.g: 3 of the employees greeted me and took me to my table).

I ordered C09, which was the crab, shrimp, tofu, tomato and sliced pork vermicelli soup. Since I read beforehand the portions are small, I also ordered A04, rice paper roll with shredded pork and vegetables. The broth was quite light and not overpowering compared to places like Kim Po. The portions were indeed on the smaller side, which made me glad I ordered the appetizer. The rice paper rolls tasted good, but was presented poorly as the 4 pieces were clumped together and two of the pieces were stuck together.

Another caveat of this place was that the kitchen lost my order initially. The waitresses realized that immediately and tried to coordinate with the kitchen, but it still took 25 minutes for my food to finally come out. Again, some kinks and improvements they need to work on there.

I'm willing to give this place a second chance once everything is more settled."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the quality of the food here and hoped I would have found out sooner.
Wait staff are polite, prompt and attentive for an Asian restaurant.
I got the vermicelli with sausage and pork. It was wonderfully balanced. The meats are very flavourful and on the salty side but works perfectly when you mix it all up. The pork was one of the best I've had for Vietnamese food. I would prefer that they use thicker noodles but it's still very tasty.
As a group, we also got the ground pork over shrimp crackers (not sure the English name). It was very messy to eat since they kind of overkilled the toppings, especially the vermicelli, so it eats messier than an overstuffed taco. It was also delish, with a good mesh of flavours and textures.
Overall, extremely impressed and the price point is reasonable."}
{"text":"updated: dec 07 2016
a little history, i gave this restaurant 3/5 stars before I've been here over 30+ times since they opened.in those 30+ visits not one was over 3 stars.

i came here with a big table and the service and food was absolutely horrendous.

Firstly the service; the waitress was just rude asking for anything simple or asking for things she was supposed to give us with our dinner was responded with attitude.  The rude waitress almost put a hot bowl of pho on a gentlemen's arm on the next table, she has no idea what she is doing.  I wont waste anymore time on the awful experience from service.

the food; 2 bowls of bun bo hue = drenched and oozing in oil and they give cheap random cuts of beef that does not belong in bun bo hue.  3 bowls of pho bland, bland bland, my bowl was a rare beef and beef ball the soup wasnt full and it wasnt hot when i submerged the rare beef into the soup everything turned into blood; the soup the noodles.  2 rice dishesone that came on time extremely dry, another one hour late below average fried rice. everyone after the meal was chugging water its a sign of high MSG usage.

i cant recommend this place to anyone anymore its just bad.

i will upload pictures of the waitress who made me or my friends and family never come back to this place."}
{"text":"This is a late review, i tried this place when they first opened.  The place is clean with a nice atmosphere.  Young servers, very polite, but the food came very slow. I am a big fan of House special Pho. Been eating it since highschool.  My very first experience was spadina/ dundas area.  My review for the pho for this place is 2stars.  Maybe its changed by now, but i have not been back."}
{"text":"Decided  to try this new restaurant.  Wow, hard to believe it used to be a Harvey's. We easily got a seat and the waitress was quick to take our order.  The food was good and the portions were a good size (even brought some back home). The price seems slightly above other places, but worth it. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Still on the search of a good Pho restaurant in York Region - unfortunately Pho Quinn wasn't the one.

The portion was decent (I got a large Chefs Special Pho - Pho Dac Biet) and I couldn't finish it  - my fiance had to finish the rest. However, they only have pho in two sizes, small and large. 

The food itself was where they lost me. The meat spring roll was too crispy, it was as though it was fried either too long or three times. When I bit into it, the pieces broke into jagged and really sharp pieces. The taste of it was decent. 
As for the pho... it lacked the layers of flavours you'd usually get when you eat pho. It taste very watered down. I put lime, hoisin sauce and hot sauce in an attempt to add more flavor to it - but it didn't help at all. I'm hoping it was just a mediocre batch of pho they had. I'll probably come back in the future to see if the pho is any better.

But I'll continue my journey to find a great pho place in York Region."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with my family or girlfriend and, for the most part, I'm pretty happy with this place.

The place itself has a ton of parking.  The front's usually pretty full but every time I've been here, the back side has been pretty empty.  I say \"the back\" but really, it's an extra minute so just park there.  The place itself isn't terribly large, so I'd recommend going before 6:30 if you don't want to wait for a bit (or at least that's the case for a Saturday night).

The food's pretty good.  I've found myself liking the 'rare beef with noodles' (B2 is the selection on the menu).  I like my meat rare, but I found myself enjoying it after it changed colour anyway.  So it's not going to be red a few seconds after you get it.  Other people have noted this, but it really doesn't bother me at all.  I also found myself really enjoying the soup that it was in but that might just me having simple tastes.  I tried their vermicelli on one of my visits and I wasn't terribly crazy about it.  The size of the bowls are perfect for me; it was a small and I just barely finished it.  I couldn't imagine myself finishing a large.

The atmosphere is pretty good.  The seats in particular are pretty comfy, even if you're sitting there for a little while.  Each table also has hot and hoisen sauce as well for those that like to add it in.  They also bring bean sprouts to you.  The service is also pretty good.  People are pretty nice and whenever I go, there's usually two or three waiters / waitresses in viewing distance.  Whenever I go, they're really fast to bring any noodle dishes, which is nice.  Barely takes any time at all, even if they're busy.  This usually means appetizers come after the noodles.  Doesn't really bother me but it may some people.

I actually had an issue here with one of the waitresses disrespecting someone I was with and brought it up with the manager, who told the owner immediately and e-mailed me back.  The owner assured me that something will / was done to make sure it doesn't happen again and gave me a 15% and 10% off coupon.  The next time I went, she was actually the one who took my order and remembered me.  She was very nice and thanked me multiple times for coming back.  I was highly impressed with the whole process.

At the end of the day, I've really enjoyed my time there.  I have returned several times and plan to keep it on a list of places to go for a quick dinner."}
{"text":"I like this place. Their soup base noodles are full of flavour. I think it's better than pho88 and pho train.

It gets packed on the weekends and parking his horrible. So come early."}
{"text":"There chef house special pho is actually pretty good. Most pho places load up the MSG in their broth... but these guys keep it simple. Their spring rolls are loaded with flavours and in terms of cost it's pretty reasonable for a good pho

Plus Free WiFi as I post this review :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the seafood noodle soup. Only two fish balls and two small tiny shrimp inside. Very disappointed with the portion. Aside from that, the waiters don't know their menu and had trouble fulfilling orders."}
{"text":"Went back for second go, and was no improvement. 

Had spring rolls which were good but wasn't cut properly so separating was a chopstick struggle. Buttered chicken wings still the best appetizer so far. 

I had the My Tho clear noodles which was good in portion and fillings however the faux crab meat red colouring melted off which was a bit weird. Also...I found a piece of blue plastic ribbon in my noodle after I finished, which I received only a 15% discount for. 

Pretty disappointed now as I was hoping to have another good Pho option in Markham."}
{"text":"WARNING...If you have a big party stay away from this place.  They do not welcome large parties and never intended to seat my family of seven.  They kept on saying it would be a long wait.  But meanwhile they kept on seating tables of 3 and 4's.  When I questioned their seating arrangements all they could say was \"unfortunately we don't have any large tables\".  In other words we would never have been seated.  This is absolutely horrible customer service!!! They were totally unapologetic about it at all.  Markham is a city full of families and to not be able to accommodate this is just nonsense and poor poor planning on the owner's part.  Needless to say we will not be returning here!"}
{"text":"Cold night driving home and decided to pop in.  Pork and shrimp spring rolls were good but the large rare beef and beef ball soup was full of both and really hit the spot."}
{"text":"First time here and totally enjoyed it.  The place is clean, plenty of seating and the decor is fresh and open.  The food was great!  The quality of the beef was amazing as we had issue with other restaurants in Markham serving beef with plenty of fat.  The rolls were made to perfection and the peanut sauce was tasty.  He bean sprouts and mint leaves were very fresh and clean.  I am very picky when it comes to quality, freshness and cleanliness and this place impressed me.  The service was also impressive as we did not have to call someone to take our order as they were prompt and attentive.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Trying this place out for the first time today. Was dining in by myself, this place can get busy during lunch time so plan to arrive early. I was sat at the bar, I did not want a table seat as I know it will take long, as others would want to. I ordered a tomato based soup with shrimp, tofu, and Vietnamese sausage, spring rolls and grass jelly drink. Prices was a tad high but I know it can be better. I think when people order from the bar and changes their seat please remember where you swap them. I may come here again to try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"Sadly, it's true. This place only deserves 3 stars. Great location and its nice to have a Vietnamese option when its primarily Chinese cuisine in this area. But the mix of service and food only deserves a 3/5. Not an exceptional nor negative experience.

Sat in for lunch on a weekday. Ordered vermicelli and a steamed rice dish with a Vietnamese coffee.

Coffee was good. I look forward to reordering it next time around.

Pork chop and chicken with fried egg rice dish was OK. Pork chop was the best thing on the plate. They gave me a tiny chicken portion... I was still hungry for chicken after. And I'm all about fun and adventure with food but I'm not feeling the fried (more like scrambled, bland with indistinct flavour) egg at all.

Pork sausage, minced shrimp on sugar cane, shredded pork vermicelli was OK. Sausage was the best part. Not notable but nothing really wrong about it.

Service was THERE but the servers are a little rigid here. They are fast to take your order and bring the bill and that's about it.

Would come back but would not rave about Pho Quinn either."}
{"text":"This place is great. Its one of the two places I resort to when Im craving a bowl of soup- kind of like the first thing that comes to mind. 

Their pho broth is awesome- the place is always warm, and the people are nice (except for that grumpy guy...kind of funny tbh). 

Im loving this place. 

And fyi, Ive been here wayyyy more than 2 times :D"}
{"text":"I was craving vermicelli. I had driven by Pho Quinn a number of times and decided to try it out. 

I walked into the restaurant. The decor looked nice. I was greeted promptly by a server. I was dining by myself. I got seated at a small table with two chairs, in front of the door. It felt like it was -12°C outside with the windchill. I wanted to sit somewhere else. 

I asked if I could do a booth, as the restaurant wasn't busy for 6 pm on a Friday. The woman behind the bar said that the booths are for \"big people.\" What does that mean?! Sure, everyone staffed there speaks Cantonese, but this reason still didn't make sense. Frankly, it made me feel small. I was treated like dirt because I was hungry and dining alone.

I sat down at the table, which wobbled, making me feel seasick, but on land. I demonstrated this defect to the server, who was nice to have me move to the other small table next to the wobbly one. 

The best part about sitting at this table? It's under a heating vent that blasts heat on your head. Fun. 

I ordered the D4, which was grilled pork in vermicelli with a spring roll and shrimp on a sugar cane. It wasn't yummy. I have had better.

The meal came with tea. It took forever to get my bill. 

I don't recommend coming to this restaurant. I don't like being treated like a second-class customer because I am a lone eater. The food isn't flavourful. I certainly didn't get my money's worth. I won't be coming back. Ever."}
{"text":"Visited this place with my girlfriend on a weekday late afternoon for an early dinner.
The outside of this place looked pretty nice. 

When we walked in, one of the servers, probably on break, got up to seat us at our table but spilled her drink all over her MacBook at the booth she was sitting in herself, asked us to wait so she could clean it before she sat us.

It took a little while before we could wave down anyone to take our order.

We ordered the rare beef pho and beef brisket pho with a side of spring rolls.

The spring rolls were okay, average, but I was absolutely disappointed with the rare beef pho.

If this is their so called \"authentic\" Vietnamese cuisine, rare beef should be rare, not cooked, it was so cooked that it was dry and looked like PORK. The pho noodles were fine, and the soup base was average. 

Prices are just simply higher than any other pho place I've been to in the GTA.

Probably, definately, not coming back..."}
{"text":"Restaurant is a little bit set back from the road so I hadn't noticed it until now. We have tried various Pho places but haven't tried this one - thought lunch was a good time. Not sure why the bad reviews. Ordered our usual: special beef pho and vermicelli with spring roll, grilled pork, and shrimp on sugar cane. 

All the food had good flavour. They gave great portions of \"toppings\", although the large-size pho wasn't as large as other locations (only options are for small and large size bowl). Service was very quick. The restaurant appears very clean and well-maintained. The only thing they don't have is the option for tapioca in the smoothies. I would come back."}
{"text":"I won't be coming back here. 

There's another pho restaurant literally right behind this restaurant (near Kitchen M) which is so much older, smaller, and look somewhat crappier, but I'll choose that one over this one any day. 

I cannot bring myself to praise one thing about this restaurant, maybe the staff there hence the one star, but even so, working at an Asian restaurant you'd 'think' they'll know another language other than English... but be prepared.

The one thing that holds together a pho restaurant is their broth, but that was what the disappointment was with this place. The broth, to me, was close to tasteless (and not hot, borderline warm), and the meat/garnishes were just ugh. It was basically a bowl of warm-ish, tasteless noodles... that wasn't worth the price.

The design of the restaurant wasn't the best either. Seats are very close together and crammed.

Ugh. I just can't"}
{"text":"After all the positive and subpar reviews I had to come in and see if this place was actually a hidden gem.

I ordered the large special pho and there was a mismatch of noodle to meat portion.  There was a huge amount of noodles simmering in the bottom of the bowl but only a thin layer of meat on top.  The flavour of the pho itself was unique when I first tasted it but it quickly diluted when I added bean sprouts to the mix.  Unfortunately hot sauce and black pepper powder did not bring back the taste ): and I had to pace myself eating the meat so I wouldn't have to eat a bland bowl of noodles by the end of it.

However, my boyfriend's chicken and pork broken rice was delicious.  They did skimp a little on the meat but the flavouring was well done.  

The spring rolls were huge and this time price and quality did match.

The shop is relatively clean with good service with only one male server at the time (11AM and 6 or 7 people in the restaurant).

I feel like this is the restaurant I might venture into just because I'd like to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Gave me the worst Vietnamese coffee. When I asked for a new one the server took it back to pour more water inside."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars
My boyfriend and I ordered their rare beef noodle soup (large) and vermicelli topped with grilled pork, a spring roll, shredded pork and shredded pork skin. Their large is more like the bowl is sort of large but the meat and noodle portions are more like medium. Maybe even small compared to some more generous pho establishments. Taste-wise, it was okay. The beef slices were pretty lean. One minor difference here is that the basil leaves are picked off the stem already when they arrive at your table; I found that a little odd. Did they have someone sitting in the back picking each leave off? As for my vermicelli, it was okay. Midway through it, I remembered there was supposed to be shredded pork and shredded pork skin. I understand that it's 'shredded' but it was more like non-existent. It was mostly just grilled pork and the spring roll cut into 3 pieces. The spring roll was the best part of the meal. It was nice and crispy, and the filling was okay. 

Ambiance: 3 stars
Nicely decorated restaurant with many comfy red booth seats. Like the big windows and lots of natural light coming in (if you go during the day). 

Service: 3 stars
Standard Asian service. Our waiter did the basics and wasn't much of a talker. Meh."}
{"text":"A decent Pho place in Markham, but used to be a lot better during its grand opening days years ago.

Ordered the Pho Tai Nam: noodle soup with rare beef and flank steak.

Service is a bit on the slow side, depending on how busy the restaurant is, but flavour-wise the Pho still tastes good. My only concern is that it leaves a thin film of oil on the roof of my mouth.

Pho Quinn is probably one of the better joints for Pho in Markham, but if you're willing to travel a bit further,  you can find better."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today, and I had to write this review. I was waiting at the front desk of the restaurant for a long while. The waitress then FINALLY noticed me and asked if I was here for delivery. I said \"no, it's for here.\" When I sat down with my friend, he ordered the same meal as me. I've ordered the $9.50 \"large\" pho special. Very very small portion. Not coming back here again."}
{"text":"It taste like PHO 88 but a little bit pricier. Overall the food are good and service are good. But $7.5 for small beef ball and rare beef pho... the portion is too small."}
{"text":"Pho Quinn is the newest additional to a strip plaza that full of Asian Restaurants. This used to be Harvey's and the new business did a wonderful job in transferring the space into a modern and chic sit down restaurant.

The menu here is quite standard including most of the normal Vietnamese items Pho, Bun, Spring Roll.... Nothing too exciting. Great for casual eat. 

Special Pho Small ($7.95) and Summer Roll ($3.95) were both nicely made. The broth has a good herbal aroma and the cut of the meat quite decent and we'll prepared. But if you are hungry, I suggest in getting the large instead. The rice paper summer rolls too were a little tiny with not much filling. I was still a little hungry after finishing both items during lunch. 

Service still a little green but the waitress are nice and smiley. After all they just opened yesterday!

Room for improvement but Pho Quinn is quite promising and can be the best Vietnamese restaurant in the area since there are only 3 others in the neighborhood.

Accepts Interac and Credit Cards,"}
{"text":"Like others have mentioned for the rare beef, when it arrived the beef was cooked already. Soup base seems like an instant mix rather than a good broth. 

Not sure if it is just this one instance but there were a lot of black flies fying around  the window."}
{"text":"I love Vietnam food, I love this place cause food are good, not pricey and all waitresses are very friendly. 
I highly recommend it !!!"}
