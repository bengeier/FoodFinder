{"text":"Loved this place, to bad they left town. I love the cafeteria style that almost non existent now a days."}
{"text":"I would have thought someone would have reviewed this place by now.   No?  Ok.  Anyway, La Madeleine is a French bakery - kind of. It's not a traditional boulangerie or patisserie where you have mouth-watering pastries lined up in a glass case screaming \"Manges-moi maintenant!\" while some random Edith Piaf song is wafting out of the soundsystem above your head (three cheers for cliched French bakeries!).  This joint, especially around brunchtime on the weekends, is a complete nuthouse. Packed to the gills, it's your grandma's favorite place - that is, if The Good Egg and Coco's are too low brow for grandma. You walk in and notice that it's got a dark wood interior - not very French bakery-like, but this is Phoenix so whatever.   You take a tray and scoot up the line to order your sandwich, quiche, croque monsieur, crepe, French onion soup or whatever ever else your all of a sudden sophisticated self desires. You get your meal handed to you by the time you've reached the register and you curse yourself that you don't have eyes in the back of your head as you try to find a table.   Playing Table Shark kind of sucks when you're by yourself and then after 10 minutes you end up snagging a four-person table in a very crowded restaurant, and you begin to feel guilty, but whatever. You've got a meal to eat and damn you're hungry.  Now, who says real men don't eat quiche? I do, and I'm bonafide. But yeah, this quiche was not so awesome and has been hanging out on the counter for longer than it should have. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Kind of meandering around nondescriptville.  In any case, I'll still check this place out again to try something else, but definitely at a time when Grandma Jolene and her two sullen uber-blonde grandkids aren't standing there 3 paces away with trays in hand, giving me the evil eye as I sit relaxed and stuff my face. Kind of takes the joy out of eating food you don't remember much."}
{"text":"My mom drove me all the way over there yesterday and it wasn't there.  We should have checked Yelp first.  I looked on their website and it looks like there aren't any in Arizona anymore. My mom was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Definitely overrated. The fruit tart and the quiche are good, but some of the other items aren't as good as you'd like them to be. I guess thats why the one in fashion square closed.  and now in french:  Certainement surestim. Le fruit au got pre et la quiche sont bons, mais certains des autres articles ne sont pas aussi bons que vous voudriez qu'ils soient. Je devine des thats pourquoi celui dans la place de mode s'est ferm."}
{"text":"I don't think of this as a French restaurant, like I don't think of Hard Rock as a Rock and Roll restaurant.  Same thing - they are theme restaurants. It's a subtle distinction, sure, but I think it makes you enjoy what they are doing just a bit more.    First of all, I love the counter service.  Walk up, point to a potato gallet or a yummy looking quiche (No, not that one, THAT one....), put it on your tray, slide down to grab some tomato basil soup, and pay the bill.  That simple.  Slide down a bit more and you'll find the free bread and butter station where they have different slices or rolls, for you to grab as you'd like.  I'm a big fan of their lemonade and I especially love the glasses.  Really nice water goblets.  Tuck yourself into a cozy room or small corner while you eat and you can actually relax.    This isn't cheap though. Getting everything I just mentioned might cost you $20ish?  I never get it all at once.  They also do actual meals you have to order, they give you a # and then bring it to your table.    You're never going to be blown away by the food, but if you just think \"theme restaurant\" you might actually enjoy it."}
{"text":"The one in the scottsdale mall is still there hopefully, I love this chain, their french roast coffee is great, though pricey but most importantly the thing that made me move to PHX in the first place, their creme brulee tart, ohhhhh the breakfast of a century, so beautiful you are, I want to have you every morning for the rest of my life, I miss u sooooo, their napoleans are great too. Of all the things I remember from living in PHX for 2 years, this is the only memorable place, sad huh?"}
