{"text":"Food was good and the portion was HUGE!  Large fried rice must have weighed five pounds.  Don't let the stark interior scare you off.  Try this place!"}
{"text":"Great food for the price. I like that it looks and tastes fresh, not pre-processed. The lady is really nice, too."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Best food in Phoenix.  Cheap prices and good quality.  Orang chicken is my favorite !! But, too much food.  Wish portion are little smaller.  Cause do not like to waste food.."}
{"text":"I ordered a Special: chicken lo mein, friend rice and egg roll. Nothing to fancy. Portion size was huge, filled the whole Styrofoam container. Taste was good, it was flavorful. Egg roll was good too, and everything was hot off the stove. Would I eat from here again, yes. Would I go out my way, no. Like someone mentioned, a good hood Chinese restaurant.   I sat and ate inside this restaurant. If I can review the restaurant I'd give it a 1 star. I'm not gonna knock the decor, or lack there of. There wasn't any bugs or anything like that. It needs a makeover, this tired poor taped up restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food and friendly family owned"}
{"text":"Don't blink because you might miss this little hole in the wall while driving by and also don't judge it by its look. I have been coming here for quite a while. The food is good and the prices are even better. If you're looking for fast cheap Chinese that is much better than Panda express this is the place to go. I highly recommend the vegetable lo mein and the orange chicken. Great spring rolls too! Overall a great little spot!"}
{"text":"I work around the corner from here. It's (better than average) hood Chinese. If you keep that in mind, your expectations will be met. Quick and cheap and giant portions. My coworkers and I mostly stick to the fried rice."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!! LOW QUALITY FOOD!!! BEWARE!!!  Felt like I took a $20 bill and lit it on fire...  We ordered from take out menu (Hunan Style & Beef and Broccoli), Egg drop soup. Delivered to La Quinta hotel.   The beef was such low quality, couldn't eat two bites, both dishes. It was all fat...Couldn't chew it at all.  The egg drop soup tasted like hot water with green peas in it.   There are plenty of decent Chinese restaurants in Phoenix. I wouldn't waste your money here."}
{"text":"These portion sizes! It's a surprise that they are making a profit for practically giving food away. The best part is it's right down the street for me. Another plus is that I waited for 10 min for them to cook it fresh. Will have to visit again soon."}
{"text":"Not bad food .. inexpensive and good portions. It's a good place to grab food for lunch .. overall not bad for the price !!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Sesame Chicken my friend had the Beef and Broccoli. It would have been okay, if i would have had some sauce on my Sesame Chicken, but to no avail dry. The Beef and Broccoli was full off everything, but barely any beef or broccoli. The egg rolls were bland and tasted old and leather like. All in all I will never order from here again..."}
{"text":"Expect to have leftovers!!! So yummy and I typically dislike asian food due to the fact that most restaurants load up on the oil in the recipes this one doesnt.. so good and the servings are huge"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to eat lunch and I found small hole in the wall Chinese food. I was great!! Best Chinese food I had in a long time. The amount of food you are being served is excellent. Just make sure you order small if eating alone, believe me it is alot."}
{"text":"Huge portions, and great prices. Family owned. Really delicious food. My favorite is the Jalapeno Fried Chicken, and I love the fried rice! They have delivery too!"}
{"text":"For the price, they deserve 5 stars.   This is a mom and pop operation. Alice (the owner) is super nice and they are down to earth people. It is family friendly, as well as budget friendly.   For the same price as Panda Express if not cheaper, you get a nicer meal, plus help out the 'little guy' instead of the corporate machines running our valley under the sun.  My family likes it. This is definitely a hole in the wall, don't expect a lot of bells, but for the casual eater looking to save a buck, you can't beat their \"All Day Menu\" prices."}
{"text":"Between my parents and myself, we have pretty much eaten our way through the menu and because there are several items that I actually find myself craving, I thought I should update my review.  The veggie lo-mein is better than your average noodle. There are always a ton of fresh veggies (brocolli, carrots, onions, cauliflower, etc) with just a hint of smokiness to the noodles. Really quite wonderful.  The sesame chicken isn't like any I've ever had. It's really more like a honey glazed chicken, sprinkled with a few sesame seeds, but it is awesome. The chicken and vegetables is awesome and not over-dressed with gooey sauce. And all of the chicken dishes are made with all white meat, so you don't get that weird feeling half way through your meal that you are eating some sort of mystery ingredient.  They have two \"family meal\" options that are dirt cheap and for those of you that question whether or not you will have enough food for your family of 4 or 6, trust the guidelines and grab a big table because once the plates start arriving, you will need the room!  Although the original owners did sell about 1.5 years ago, the new family that took over is every bit as nice and dedicated to putting out good food for a decent price.  The last two bonuses are their huge delivery area and the fact that most items on the menu can be ordered as either an a la carte item (enough for 4 servings), as a meal (which comes with rice, egg roll, and crab puff), or in a bowl (with just rice).    The standouts on the menu, along with the super low prices and the flexability  for ordering just what you want, earns them an extra star!"}
{"text":"I occasionally stop by Shanghai Express for lunch because it's right down the street from my office, the food is decent, the portions are good size, a lunch combo consisting of entree, rice, egg roll, and crab puff (cream cheese) is only $5.45 after tax, the service is always friendly and usually quick, the last time I went I was in an out in less than 10 minutes  not a bad choice for quick chinese if you find yourself around 33rd ave and Thomas"}
{"text":"We don't frequent the west part of Phoenix very often. I was hungry and wanted something healthy to eat. We saw the sign and I was very skeptical. There were no cars out in the parking lot at 6:30PM. I ordered the shrimp and chicken in garlic sauce with a side of steamed veggies. The food was piping hot, freshly cooked and delicious!  The service was quick and very friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Huge fresh portions! Owners are precious and aim to please!  Stop by for a relaxing fresh meal!"}
{"text":"When we walked in, no one was there. A few people walked in for take out. It felt a little sketchy.   My rice was burnt, everything else was alright. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"They have great portions but don't really but. Seasoning  or flavor in there food kinda bland  I had orange. Chicken didn't taste like it at all  and the chicken chow mein taste like it could make it at home anytime you have to put on soy sauce all over you food for flavor I give F"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! First time ordering from here and I am very impressed with how fast it was delivered and with the quality of the food. I recommend the Mongolian Beef and pork fried rice! The person who took my order and the delivery person were both so friendly. Definitely ordering again in the future!!"}
{"text":"I was struggling to decide what I wanted for lunch today and decided on Shanghai Express. What a disappointment! I ordered the General Tso chicken with an egg roll, crab puff, and rice. The egg roll had a strange after taste. The crab puff had no filling. The chicken was over cooked and had almost no flavor. It was over cooked to the point it was difficult to chew. The rice was pretty good. I can not imagine going back there, which is a shame since I work about a mile a way."}
{"text":"Good food. I would recommend thus place to anyone looking for hood Chinese good. Loved their spicy orange chicken. Pork fried Rice. And beef snow peas. Delivery was quicker than I thought."}
{"text":"Fantastic phone customer service and delivery to hotels. Very nice over the phone and helpful with the menu items. If you are an out of towner visiting and don't want to leave your space and crave Chinese....this is your place!"}
