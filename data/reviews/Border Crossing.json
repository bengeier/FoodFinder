{"text":"The Border Crossing is aptly named, if you, like me, get a little uneasy when crossing into the States.  This place just puts you on guard for some reason.  Let's just say there's a general dinge in the air.
Within that expansive general dinge, they have 10 VLTs, a jukebox, and a stage with a dance floor in front.  Border Crossing offers a few nightly specials to coax the strays in.  Come Friday and Saturday, live music is offered.  Thursday night from 9pm - 1am they get a Karaoke Jam going.  On Flames game days, they offer $3.25 pints and $9.75 jugs.
This place is certainly not a destination pub, but if you're in the area and you're thirsty, it's there.  Word to the wise, just like an actual border crossing, make sure you've got your story straight before making the trip - it'll just be easier that way."}
{"text":"I don't think I'd bring my passport to this Border Crossing. It's a neighbourhood pub with bad food specials every night, drink specials, a pool league and it strikes me as being the centre of a syndicated crime ring, but it might just be coincidence that criminals show up here.

In any case, as is my custom, I quite enjoyed it. We watched the Flames lose and had a chat with the barkeep who, despite his hockey team loyalties, turned out to be a decent guy. The beer was $3.75 and we had a good time. There is a lot of pool space here and they offer drunken sots other games of chance and might like hitting the punching bag. I had my back to it and it quickly caught my attention after a guy hit it. Out of the corner of my eye, I thought he was smashing in a vending machine....That would have made sense.

Anyway, a friendly local pub in the North East that seems to attract it's own crowd of locals and real-life images of police sketches....."}
{"text":"For the ones that complain about this place, I don't understand. Look at it !! It's an effen dive bar. You can spot this a block away. WTF were you expecting here ?  For a shit hole in forest dump, it scores  a what did you expect!  Top rating for what it is"}
{"text":"I disagree with the previous reviews.  The service has been friendly whenever I've gone there.  I like the wing nights and the open mic nights. The Border Crossing is one of a dwindling number of places in Calgary where you can have fun and a bit of a nosh without breaking the bank.  I wish there were more places like this and fewer yuppie bars."}
