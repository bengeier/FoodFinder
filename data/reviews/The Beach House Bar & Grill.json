{"text":"This place is a true hidden gem.  We have been there twice and each time they have blown us away with the friendly service, great music and amazing food.  The Lobster bisque is creamy, with big chunks of seafood and shrimp.  The edamame are perfectly cooked and salted. The chicken Parmesan is a huge portion and the tomato mixture that they use is perfectly balanced.  The chicken and waffles is phenomenal! The combination of the sweet and savory, the breading on the chicken didn't take the sweet part away but not overwhelming.  The waffle was light and flavourful and the sweet potato fries with the apples brought it all together.  For dessert you cannot go wrong with their Bailey's creme Brule... Honestly the best Brule I have had anywhere!  Their white chocolate apple bread pudding is nicely dense and not too sweet.  It is well worth the trip to enjoy more of their delights.  The owner Karl and his staff are amazing and we look forward to many more visits!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this friendly, cool
place a 5 star review. 
I went a second time with my son and husband.  
Carl greeted us warmly. Wait staff lovely. 
Ambience 10/10. 
My disappointment is again with the food. 
The guys has seafood linguine. The server said they had run out of mussels so more shrimp. 
They said it was good. 
I had chicken schnitzel. It was okay. Heavily breaded.
Not sure what's with the chef. 
The calibre is not near what it should be.
Anyhow, it's a cool restaurant..maybe better for drinks and snacks?
It's across from The Stone Lion which is usually busy. Maybe Beach House gets the overflow. 
Keep walking east a bit and try the Gastropub. 
They have a real chef in the kitchen. 
My son says we should come back one more time to be fair. 
Will do.

{"text":"Amazing little spot by the woodbine beaches!!

Food was fantastic. I came with 4 other people and all of us are stuffed and satisfied. The plates looked and tasted amazing!!

This spot is super cozy. It was perfect and rainy. Big open window. Free samples of Beau. I got a Stella and long Island iced tea. 

The owner Jane came and sat with us and she was so lovely. Her hubby Roman was over by the bar.  The benches have actual pillows and tvs everywhere. 100% would come again.

Tons of conversation pieces all over the walls and the service was quick.

Please God look at my video of the dessert.... brought out special for us. Holy. Crap.

I had the lobster bisque and calamari. Although slightly salty, I really couldn't fault them... and o.m.g the lobster was cooked perfectly.

Everyone was so attentive. Waitresses were pretty. Washrooms clean.

I highly suggest coming. I'll be back. Location was key."}
{"text":"Nice new spot in the beach. Breakfast special was prepared well. Not greasy, light meal with bacon, eggs and light home fries. 

Clean spot with local decor. Chef seems like he has his act together. 

We had a couple of mimosas and a local cider. Nice touch to a 2:00 Brunch."}
{"text":"We've tried this place a few times now since it opened. It was never amazing but we gave it a chance as overall if feels like it should be a good venue and the menu was a bit more interesting than most family friendly restaurants in the area. However, it has gone downhill. The decor has always struck me as odd and it never feels very clean. Even worse, last night I had to ask our server to wipe our table when we sat down and there was all kinds of stuff on the floor under our table. The roses on all the tables were completely dead. The sink in the women's washroom was broken - why not get it fixed right away? The menu has been simplified and is pretty boring, and the dishes as described on the menu are rarely served exactly as described, with items missing or random things added, and key parts of the meal are sometimes under or over cooked. The cooks are probably not very experienced and it feels like they are having issues with food costs and running the kitchen. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Awesome host awesome food so plentiful and flavourful. 
Chicken parm so good my boy got the pizza also so yum a definite place to go"}
{"text":"TLDR; the owner rudely said we were wrong when we complained about the chicken being dry and burnt, food was alright. 

Was looking for a place to eat around woodbine beach and decided to come here. 

Our server was super nice, new to the job but you could tell she was trying her best. We ordered the Jerk Chicken entree and the seafood linguine. The seafood linguine was alright and the seafood was too over cooked. Imagine biting into a hard shrimp, yeah I know. 
The Jerk Chicken tasted super burnt and dry to which we decided to ask our server if it was suppose to be this way, she kindly said she will bring it to the kitchen to which the kitchen offered to make us something else. 

Moments later, the owner of the restaurant approaches us and asked what problems we had with the chicken very rudely. We politely replied that we thought it was too burnt tasting and salty/dry, he then replied with \"well just to let you know that I looked at the chicken and it's not dry so you're wrong.\" and then he walked away. He also refused to make us something new or remove the item completely from our bill even though we had not even touched the food. 

We later learned that the owner of the restaurant is actually very rude to all his workers. Would not come back to this restaurant again, maybe Gordon Ramsey should come teach him a thing or two about restaurant managing. 

We generously tipped our server who tried to help us, she is a 10/10."}
{"text":"Had supper there tonight, great place!  Old beach vibe with great food, and excellent service.  We had the Souvlaki wrap with salad and fries. Excellent!
Prices are fair for the quality of the food.  Portions are large, you will not leave hungry!  
They have entertainment some evenings, tonight they had a piano player.
There are many places in the beaches for food.  This is one of the best."}
{"text":"First time here. Love the decor. Service was delightful. 
Wine prices are excellent with a wide selection of wines by the glass. 
Hubby's Canadian Burger was declared as delicious. 
The Hummus salad was a big disappointment. I didn't care for the hummus and the fact that it was on top of the salad meant that I couldn't really get at the salad below.  
Had it at least been on the side I could have enjoyed the salad. 

When asked how we enjoyed our meal I said I felt I had to be honest and that I had not liked it at all. Server apologized profusely. Told her it wasn't her fault. 
That being said, there was no recognition on the bill of an unhappy customer. 

With the large number of very good restaurants in the Beach, I'm not in a big hurry to return."}
{"text":"We came to the area first time to visit another place, and saw that our friend Bob Wegner, a fabulous musician, was going to be playing there. So we stopped in to hear him play, and had dessert. My husband had a lobster bisque, and we shared some edemame. He still raves about the soup! He then ordered the baileys creme brulee and I had a white chocolate apple bread pudding. Soo good! What actually we liked at the beginning was the owner himself, Carl, welcomed us himself. He is so nice and welcoming!

Then we returned tonight for another night of Bob's music and kept enough money out for dinner. Carl remembered us, Nd welcomed us back. Nice touch! And the food.... Oh my god! So full.... So good! The portions are huge! Prices are very reasonable... I had the chicken and waffles, with caramelized apples and sweet potatoe fries... Every piece on its own was very good, but you put it all together in one bite, and it's heaven in your mouth. Full of flavour and goodness. Something you have to try for yourself! Hubby had the chicken parmesan and was so in love that he ate the whole thing! He usually doesn't lol

The servers are nice and very attentive without being pushy. The atmosphere is beautiful and we love the bookshelf wall behind the bar. We shall return (with or without Bob!) as there are so many things we still need to try. Come here. Eat here. Relax here. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here on Valentine's Day, Guy who walks around \" might be owner \" was very kind as I came early to book a table and he helped me with menu and stuff. The music and mood of this place just on point. Stuff is great and passion. We asked about wine and they would bring us couple of glasses sorted wines and explained each of them. Very happy with this place .Definitely will come again"}
{"text":"Great space, awesome food -& no cover entertainment. Have been in twice now, and will be a regular."}
