{"text":"Decided to take my Dad and kid in for Fathers Day in hopes of catching the rest of the US Open. The numerous tv's in the bar had every event on so we stayed much longer than expected. Service was prompt and very helpful while the menu had an option for all of us. I chose to start with the Drunken Sea Monkey app which had six perfectly cooked shrimp in on of the most flavorful Cajun inspired sauces I have ever had. After that I opted for the BBQ rib special and I was not disappointed. I'll be sure to keep watching their Facebook page for more specials and the live music calendar."}
{"text":"Just came home from Ginger Monkey and I was...well, not impressed.  I live close and was really hoping it would be a regular stop, but I guess not.  The service was acceptable but not impressive.  I asked for a hefeweizen but no; they have 30 beers on tap including 6 different IPAs, but not a hefeweizen in the house.  The menu was ugly.  Someone is trying to be too creative.  They offer things like kung pao wings. deviled eggs, and crispy brussel sprouts, but even their hamburger has to have aioli and some caramelized onion tomato stuff.  Too fancy for the market.  This place will last about 18 months and then will be restaurant road kill."}
{"text":"Plenty of people working so good first impression when a greeter opened the door for us. Unfortunately there were more girls at the hostess stand than helping us. We sat in the bar and left unattended after waiting 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Have been here a handful of times...the food has always been above average. However, our last visit was the worst experience we've had in recent memory:  1) they were out of the first 3 choices off their stock beer menu, my 4th choice beer came with a severely chipped glass on the rim (cut my lip on it...waitress didn't seem very concerned)   2) had our two little kids with us and the waitress didn't take our food order for 45 minutes after we got our drinks (she was too distracted with a large group next to us)  3) that large group next to us spent the night swearing in front of the kids (classy) ...with no care from the wait staff or management.  4) had to cut dinner short after too many f-bombs from the large group 5) after all if that, the manager gave us $15 off our bill of $100 (let me recap, cut lip, no sign of waitress for 45 minutes, forced to leave dinner early because of lowlife group next to us cussing in front of kids)  Nice."}
{"text":"Tried this place shortly after it opened. Cute atmosphere. Staff was good. The food, though...AMAZING! It was really good!"}
{"text":"I was so ready to love this place. I recommended to my friends that we go here after work to enjoy drinks and some dinner before the big Chandler-Perry High School state semi-final football game across the street at Hamilton High School. Big mistake. My husband and I showed up about a half hour after my friends. It took the waitress 20 minutes to come over to our table and take our drink order. We then had to wait 30 more minutes to be served a beer and a glass of wine. When she finally delivered the drinks we asked what the hold-up was and her response was, \"Our bartenders are really chatty tonight. Sorry.\" Seriously? That's what you tell us? We then wanted to order some food before heading to the game. We asked her if the wait for food would be the same as the wait for our drinks and she said that it probably would be worse and would take between 30 and 45 minutes to get some nachos and a burger. We decided not to order any food at that point, settled our bill and left. Won't be going back. ***Update 12/02/16 Well, after tonight's CBS evening news \"dirty diners\" piece I saw The Ginger Monkey received the most health code violations (7). It is unlikely that I will ever visit the restaurant again and would recommend that all diners stay away."}
{"text":"Let me start with the atmosphere! This place is cool with an outdoor patio that will be great this spring. Now the food not very good! Had to send the short rib manicotti back because it had zero flavor. I had the spicy chicken sandwich and the chicken tasted like it was frozen. Very tough. Will only be back for drinks food was not worth the drive"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food at all. The ambience was great, but the food was not good. My husband ordered a TV dinner. He loved the concept, but said the fried chicken was the worst he's ever had and he loves fried chicken. Rather than being crispy, it had a hard, overcooked shell that tasted burnt. My husband said it seemed like they had pre-cooked the chicken then breaded it and fried it.  then fried it too much.  I had pasta stuffed with cheese and short ribs. It was drizzled with a little sauce, although I couldn't taste it. Nor could I taste the short rib. Basically, it was like eating plain ricotta cheese in a manicotti noodle. No flavor. It was unpleasant to eat and I didn't finish it.  Granted, we did go there on their second night, and maybe things have improved, but I'm just not sure I'm willing to find out."}
{"text":"Gave this place a second try last night just for a drink. First time we weren't very impressed and this time either. We walked up to the bar which was pretty crowded. We asked a waitress if we can just go sit on patio or should we order our drink and then go out. She said to take a seat and she would be right out. 10 minutes later and she looks right at us as she serves another table. We got up and left. We will never go again! Plus smoking on the patio was a turn off as well."}
{"text":"Can't give enough stars. The perfect place! Our go-to for family brunch, lunch out. Great for evening hang out."}
{"text":"love this place. great drinks and food! visited on a biz trip...great atmosphere and inviting patio. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is decent but more than half of the dessert menu they were out of when I visited.  Staff are all new as it's a new restaurant and you can tell they are still working out a few kinks operationally.  Has potential but will have to try again and see if things get any better with time. Still undecided"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, and attentive staff! New patio is awesome they did such a great job with the place."}
{"text":"We have been to this place three times.  Each time we have been impressed with the quality of food but even more impressed with the customer service.  I know if they would just add a REVERSE happy hour this would be the NEW place to be on this corner.  (Hint hint)  Love this place.  Honestly?  I am happy that we found a place that has healthier options for appetizers."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday evening for dinner and have to say this is my new favorite spot in Chandler.  We sat in the bar area which is open seating and the service was great.  The food was delicious...our table of 3 ordered 3 entries the  Chianti short ribs with Risotto, Angus Beef Burger and the Geek Flatbread.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  Highly recommend trying it out. Oh the bathrooms have a surprise you must try!"}
{"text":"The only reason why it got one star is because you can't give it negative stars. Horrible service, food (even appetizers) take forever to get, and what restaurant doesn't even have a drink or happy hour menu?? What a joke. This place won't last long! To top it off...female bartender only stopped at male tables to take drink orders when they were empty. 30 minutes and NO appetizer or drink refill. Once the newness wears off, this place will sink FAST!"}
{"text":"This place sucks!  Service is slow, non attentive waiters and bar servers.  Came in at 5:30, sat at 3 locations and was never served. Finally sat at bar, just to see if someone would acknowledge and serve us.   Took 8 minutes.  Place was not busy, didn't seem understaffed, just poor service."}
{"text":"Food was great service was awesome and everyone was friendly, the owner even took the time to stop by the table and just say hi. Great menu."}
{"text":"$.10 beer when temp is more than 110 degrees. Natalie and Lauren are fantastic!! You should come here."}
{"text":"Very nice patio! Good food and entertainment! They have happy hour every day!! Very nice place!"}
{"text":"We gave this place 'one more try' only because it is dog friendly. We hesitated because every single time we have been there, the service was beyond horrible. One time we even complained to the owner, who gave us a 'complimentary brownie'. Our most recent visit didn't disappoint. Why? Because it took 15 mins to be noticed. Another 10 mins to get 'water' and 45 mins to get a sandwich on which my husband and I split. NEVER EVER AGAIN we we EVER be back. Our food was cold, fries clearly had been sitting under the heat lap for most of the day. Having worked in the restaurant business for quite some time , this place is a disaster. Our pups liked the burger dish. - I mean they waited 45 mins for it"}
{"text":"Nice patio and atmosphere. The food is good and there are a few non traditional entrees available. The wait staff was friendly and the service was prompt. The only downside is the price.  Certain dishes (like the shrimp) were overpriced for what was received. However, the drink prices were on par compared to other competitors in the area. This is a great local spot and one I recommend for casual dining.   Update 5/2017. The menu has changed and the pricing is more inline with surrounding venues. The menu changes and food are all positive changes too."}
{"text":"The place is super cool looking, love the decor and the ambiance. You can tell they put a lot of effort into the interior. The patio is great too, huge with fire pits! We also had great service!   But the food? The food is EH. And I feel so bad for not giving this place more stars but we were REALLY disappointed. Food is extremely over priced and the menu is very small. We spent 50$ on two meals and two beers and were not satisfied at all. What a bummer because we were super excited to try it out. Definitely won't be back for food (maybe a drink if we are close by)."}
{"text":"Since opening, Ginger Monkey has been a regular in the rotation for my wife and I. Unfortunately, their service is very poor right now, and we have been very disappointed recently. The food is good, and happy hour deals are solid. However, they are perpetually training new servers and every step of the dining experience is off just a bit. I'm sure they deal with high turnover like most bars but they need a better training process. With Blue32 moving in down the road they will be in trouble if they don't get it together."}
{"text":"New to the area and have been wanting to try this restuarant.  I was very disappointed.  Service was poor.  Food was not very good.  Good news...  the beer was cold.  Would not recommend.  I have been to Blue 32 and Zipps nearby and would recommend over Ginger Monkey."}
{"text":"This is such a great place. The staff is amazing. Friendly, courteous and fun. The food is very good and keeps getting better. The drinks are great. Prices are very reasonable. Overall this is my new favorite place. Oh, and the patio rocks..."}
{"text":"We tried this place a few months ago and enjoyed it. Service and food were great back then.  Unfortunately, when we were there yesterday, the staff was inept, unprepared and had difficulty figuring out simple tasks like how to turn on the patio heaters, and how to combine two tables to seat more than four people. Medium rare burger had no pink, so overdone, and the fries were really overdone, I mean brown and dried out. It took a LONG time for the food to come out, and we had to flag down a server for refills, and salt and pepper. This was around 1pm on a Saturday...wow.  No idea what happened to this place, really disappointed for a $70 something lunch, and we didn't even order drinks."}
{"text":"Just had the most amazing sangria here.  I am not a drinker and I had 2 glasses.  Flavor was amazing."}
{"text":"Horrible experience today at Ginger Monkey. Went to watch the bronco game and will never go back. Found a fish scale in one of our deviled eggs. Ordered the chicken fingers and it took 30 mins to get, come to find out they ran out and had to make more. Then we ordered a cookie with ice cream and we were told they ran out of ice cream. So we ordered the cookie anyways and they never brought it. It was on our final bill too. Are you kidding me? The food isn't good and the service is poor. Needless to say we won't ever be going back."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!!!! I've been there twice and will be going back there many more times. Great menu the stuffed mushrooms and pesto deviled eggs are awesome!!! And the B.Y.O.B (build your own burger) is a great idea you can make it however you want best burger I've ever had. And the outside patio area is a great idea and dog friendly (they even have a pet menu) I highly recommend trying this place out. Can't forget the service was awesome and the owners were very friendly."}
{"text":"We went here specifically because they are dog friendly (patio only). It was great. Nice casual laid back patio with plenty of comfortable seating. Our pup enjoyed the attention from the staff and the salmon and rice dish made just for her. We had chicken wings and the ahi tuna burger. Both were freshly made and tasted fine. The monkey drop, their version of a lemon drop, was FABULOUS!  Appreciated the linen napkins. Restaurant was clean and service very friendly. Highly recommend if you're looking to lunch with your favourite canine friend or family member."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for some drinks and food and wow were we shocked by how good both were. It's a new spot and the service and ambience were awesome. I highly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!!!!!!! This place blew me away. From the food to the decor this place is the whole package. For being a huge establishment it felt warm and homie. It has something for everyone a great bar (don't worry they have a separate space if you want to just have a quit dinner)....TVs everywhere, pool table, darts, huge patio there is even a kid area with arcade games!! Now to the best part the FOOD!!!! Everything was amazing we ate so much food and still had left overs( the meatloaf even cold the next day was awesome) great bang for your buck with the sizes they give you. We got the duck fat fries and wings to start with for our main dishes we got spare ribs with the best risotto ever and the meatloaf TV dinner (2 words cream corn) Can't wait to go back... maybe this weekend cause did I mention they have BRUNCH!!!!"}
{"text":"0-3 trying this place.  I really wanted this place to succeed because I like the bar area and the open patio.  I love the layout but the food is not up to par at all.  This restaurant would have no chance of surviving up in Scottsdale.    Short Rib Manicotti - This was not appetizing at all.  Where is the short rib?  Mostly cheese inside with little shreds of short rib.  BBQ sauce seemed like a bad store bought brand.  Roasted Veggie Pot Pie - the good news is that it is not salty.  The bad news is the crust and the pie had absolutely no real flavor.    Stuffed Prawns - Over-powered with bacon on the shrimp.  The vegetable medley was not seasoned.  The sauce had really no flavor to it at all.    This is my plea to please hire a top rated chef.  Change the menu completely."}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I have been in every week since they opened. We normally sit at the bar. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. We have enjoyed several of their dishes. I think my favorite are the sausage  stuffed mushrooms. The only thing, I would suggest would be to add a few more appetizers to the menu. They also had a delicious pizza on the menu when first opening, but have taken that off. Please add the pizza back. Ginger Monkey is a great addition to our neighborhood   Unfortunately, tonight was lacking. We came in to catch the D'backs and U of A football game. We were confused at first....we thought maybe PAC 12 was not offered, so we did ask the bartender on duty. His answer...we decided not to show U of A tonight. It's an AZ team!!! Are you kidding me???? Bar seating was pretty much empty. We visit your establishment at least once a week. To be honest, if Sarah or Lauren are not around it's just not the same. Very disappointed!! We would have stuck around for a few drinks. Had one and left."}
{"text":"We really want to like this place! The atmosphere is cool. Patio, game room, LOTS of TVs. The food is just eh, as others have said. It's really a let down. Nothing I've tried has made me want to have it again. Please fix the menu. Also, I don't know why but we have always had the strangest service here.. if we are with a group or just the two of us, it's always slow and strange. I will say the management seems to try, as they are always walking around asking if we need anything, but the servers themselves have just been... off..."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio for just over an hour and not once got acknowledged by the staff or servers. Got no service what do ever. Sadly this is the second and last time this will happen. Band was barely just ok. Will never go back.  Thanks for acknowledging my review. We were there from about 9:30-10:30 pm. I was there a few months ago and sat inside and the exact same thing happened. We had to go up to the bar and order our own drinks. I noticed a lot of people just went and got their own drinks from the bar inside. Certainly not how I'd want my place to be ran. I would have not posted a review like this had this not happened previously. The first time I just chalked it up to the staff being busy or whatever. Hope you get it sorted out. Thanks."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Relaxed staff and relaxed clientele.  The bartenders knew the beers.  I ordered the salmon for supper.  I sent my compliments back to the chef - cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"We love this place! The owner Doug is fantastic! Really knowledgeable and friendly, always greeting us with a huge smile! The bartender Sarah is always great too, super fun & great at her job. My husband recently left his wallet there and Doug found it and went completely above & beyond to try to contact us to return it. We are kinda regulars there but he didn't have our numbers, so he tried every method of finding our contact information and my husband DID  get his wallet back with all cash/cards intact. Such an amazing effort to save us a huge headache! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!! We are huge fans of Ginger Monkey, drinks are fantastic, food is delicious and most of all the staff is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"My most favorite place to have worked out of 20 years on and off in the industry! Owners and management are family, not just bosses  military friendly  Also, best patio around! Puppy dog friendly with a special K9 menu. Chef Marc kicks ass in the kitchen, and you can enjoy yourself in a chill dining room or lively bar area with kick ass monkey cocktails, and the patio is a great mix of everything. Opening for lunch, and adding live music at night has been a great addition. It's fun no matter what time you go, and that's not just my biased opinion speaking. This is a must have on the regular visit list. Ginger Monkey is here to stay!!!"}
{"text":"We frequent this restaurant often. We love sitting outside and they have an amazing patio!  The food and atmosphere is great!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced Beer  Slow Service  Food/Beer list are both good, just not worth the money or time.  You can get a 32 oz beer next door at Zipps for the same price as a normal pour at Ginger Monkey."}
{"text":"This place was beautifully remodelled. Love the patio, the food and service were great. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The food was what you would expect from bar food but it wouldn't be what would bring you back. The atmosphere and staff were good. The staff was attentive and management was very quick to remedy some inadequate food."}
{"text":"In an effort to support a local business, we tried this place for our anniversary date... sadly, it was a total disaster.... we understand it's a new place and all, but our wait was over one and a half hours, for two burgers and two salads, the two salads came wrong, they \"forgot\" to add the chicken and then brought it as a side about 10min later, the burgers and fries were cold. They said \"we'll make it up to you, we'll comp your drinks\". But we were all drinking water LOL, and the one soda we did have, was included with the burger. The final \"make it right by you\" was a $2 (two dollar) discount on a $50+ check, for the wait and the mess and the wrong orders... needless to say, it was a rather disappointing experience for us, hopefully they get it right soon..."}
{"text":"We got a table outside which was nice. For an appetizer, we got the deviled eggs which were very good. For dinner, I got the turkey avocado panini and my boyfriend got the spicy sriracha chicken. The turkey was very tender but there could have been a lot more flavor and spice but the spicy sriracha was very tasty! The fries were good too but had a little too much seasoning. For dessert we got the cheesecake which was also good and the flavor was great. With this all being said, the only reason I am giving this restaurant three stars is because of the service. It took FOREVER to get our food and drinks and one of the drinks we ordered we had to send back (and we aren't that picky). It took at least thirty minutes to get our dessert, which was already made! Furthermore, whenever servers were coming out with food, they had to go to pretty much every table in order to find out whose food it was! I think that there needs to be more employee training here all around and then maybe we would go back. It's too bad, because the food was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Wow! Love love love this place! Was here on a business trip and ended up at this place twice in one week!! The owners, \"ginger\" and \"monkey\", oh yeah...just ask them...awesome!!! Great night with coworkers, and the owners! Great people. Will be back for sure next time here for business..."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food! The duck fat loaded fries and pesto deviled eggs were delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yelp made me give it one star or I wouldn't have even given even one since we didn't get to have any food. We went in around 2 and was first told we could only order from the appetizer and kid menu. What? Crazy. We were not happy but we went with it.  After a few minutes a very rude (I assume manager) told us we could ONLY have nachos or deviled eggs?  What?  She never apologized and she wasn't nice about it AND she didn't explain why a restaurant couldn't serve us food!  I predict they won't be in business long if this is the way they treat customers who come in to spend their hard earned money at their establishment."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in to Ginger Monkey last night, our overall experience was good!! We meet both owners and they we great, very friendly and always smiling!!   The menu for us was not enough choice but when we did order I had the mushrooms (YUMMY) and my husband had the Angus burger (also he said amazing) we were very happy with our choice...   The selection of music was great I wished it was a little louder.. :)  But overall great job guys!!   Thank you for money worth spent on a Saturday night"}
{"text":"Oh where to begin.  The only person that actually will pay attention, refill you glass and come back to your table 37 minutes after ordering is the hostess.  We had to walk up to the bar to go get our beers ourselves of course hot from sitting there after our food came out cold. It wasn't even busy!! The food is meh. But goodness.... this place is awful!!"}
{"text":"The food tastings were  so slow coming out for this VIP night that a small pasta j was fresh but run of the mill tasting.  The cheese topped pita bread was nice.  Save your money on the mushroom appetizers though.   I am sorry to say the tomato sauce was \"bulk bin\" tasting...    disappointing after it  being sold to us like it was a favorite menu item. The service was friendly and the patrons were pretty and Chandler dignitaries were seen but the lack of flavor in what we ordered  and the slow service for a night that should showcase their best....puts this restaurant in my  \"I won't\" be returning anytime soon \" category."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Tuesday when I had a bit of time to kill... took a little while for someone to greet me and get my a menu when I sat at the bar - granted it looks like they had a skeleton crew going. Didn't look like they were offering seating in the main dining room - just the bar... which was fine for me. I ordered the chopped salad which I consider a pretty straight forward thing to get... and it was doused in dressing, there was a pool of it in the bottom of the bowl when I was finished and I wasn't willing to have the last few bites as it was just soaked by the time I'd gotten to it. I did get checked on a few times while I was sitting there... I would try it again, though my expectations won't be that high."}
{"text":"Came here for a large gathering of 20+ or more people and ended up being a great place to hangout. TVs and games of all sorts (board games, darts, pool, giant jenga, and more) were plenty.   Short Rib Manicotti- three large stuffed pasta tube shells (hence manicotti) like the size of enchiladas - filled with ricotta cheese and short braised ribs, covered in melted fontina cheese, pecorino romana, and natural jus. Some of the short rib was on the dry side but the cheeses and jus helped with the dryness. Overall still a nice dish. $14  Grilled Angus Beef Burger - nothing but a usual angus burger with a delicious caramelized onion tomato jam, smoked applewood bacon, arugula, fontina cheese with seasoned fries. You may sub for the duck fries too. $11  Too full for the croissant bread puddin' but will be on my hit list for next time!! Also need to try the jumbo lump crab cakes, as well as brunch. Many tasty items to try.   Service was fantastic with waters and beers and beverages filled before you finish. A spot not to miss!   On a side note, all of the stalls in the women bathroom had a bidet, and there were mints and mouthwash a minty fresh mouth, and hand lotion for dry hands. So funny and odd because I've never seen a bidet in any USA restaurant bar."}
{"text":"We love this place!  It has both a great beer and wine selection. The food is really eclectic and delicious. It's got an excellent outdoor patio and our waitress Katie is wonderful!"}
{"text":"We loved this place! And because I picked it, my husband was skeptical...  We were seated right away, our server got our drinks and apps in right away so that we could get the happy hour pricing. The manager swung by and let us know how cute our baby is. Food was fast and very good!  Duck Fat Fries: yummmmm Deviled Eggs: omg  Cold beers, friendly wait staff, good food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We visited GM this weekend. The place is beautiful and the staff were friendly, the manager walked by our table and asked if we need anything. The food was DELICIOUS.  I am definitely going back to try more of their delicious food.   P.S. Ladies, You HAVE to check their Restroom .. WOW!!"}
{"text":"Fate brought me to Ginger Monkey. I had been under the impression that it was a sports bar/not kid friendly type place but I was wrong! They not only have kid friendly events throughout the year, but they have lots of food that kids like.   I had the tomato bisque soup and a salad. Both were excellent. The tomato bisque was outstanding. My children had chicken tenders, a southwest burger, and a sandwich. My husband had the jumbo wings. We were all highly satisfied with our food. We were told that they have a new chef who has stepped up the game and, while I don't know what the food used to taste like, I can say that we weren't disappointed with our meals.   I will say that I met the owner, Jackson, and he was an incredible guy. We had a manager stop by to chat and she told us stories about Jackson's kindness to his staff. This alone was enough to make me want to come back.   They have a dog friendly patio and even a dog menu with 4 choices! We will be bringing the dogs here for a meal very soon.   We will be regular customers of this establishment. I can't wait for the family movie night."}
{"text":"This place was a really nice surprise.  Very close to Alamo if you're looking for grub and drinks before a movie. Large outdoor area with comfortable seating. Lots of TVs. Our server was very friendly and helpful. We didn't see Elway which is sad but the food was very good and we will be returning."}
{"text":"Wow this place is great! Loved the food and drinks. Patio was cool and friendly. My humans enjoyed their food and drinks too."}
{"text":"Awesome new bar in the area! Everyone was Super friendly and made me feel at home. I look forward to spending time here at the local spot. Nice open patio, great people. Thanks for the great late night experience!"}
{"text":"The fireplace outside was perfect!! Plenty of room for friends. Pool table. Dart board. Jenga...What else do you need?!?!"}
{"text":"We went last night to listen to The Rich Berra Band and had a blast. It was our first time visiting Ginger Monkey and we'll definitely be back. My boyfriend had the pizza with extra cheese and I had stuffed mushrooms. Our server was great and very attentive even though they were so busy, he never let our drinks get empty without checking on us. The bar area was packed, but in a good way and it was still easy to get up and use the restroom. Several people were dancing too since the band was rocking! The women's restroom all have bidet seats and is very clean. Great experience, we had a great time!"}
{"text":"I found this place after searching for a new bar scene in the chandler suburb area. It looked promising and the place was close enough to all other established businesses. So friend and I went out to grab some lunch and drinks on a Saturday afternoon during the Utah NBA game. Yes I agree not the top notch time for a bar but I expected the experience to be quite good. Our waitress was nice but didn't know what was on the seasonal menu. Menu is not extensive and definitely not veg-friendly. Aside from a grilled cheese and two kinds of salad (chopped and spinach), not much going on.   Suggestion for the restaurant - add more veg options to the menu and know what you have behind the counter."}
{"text":"Honestly, I think this might be the best restaurant in the entire Phoenix area.  Also, it is not a chain. I am not knocking chains. For instance, I really love hanging out at the Yard House at Desert Ridge. However, I think these guys have that place beat with their calamari and ahi. I know it's all a matter of taste. But there are some things that are not matters of taste. The Ginger Monkey wait staff was amazing, my waiter was particularly amazing, they were extremely solicitous regarding my welfare in regards to their food. Speaking of food, let me speak of their food:   Calamari Appetizer -- just an absolutely wonderful presentation. The calamari rings are thick and juicy and they are arranged sequentially with sauce applied and other garnish. This is a presentation I've never seen attempted. It's amazing. The calamari are delicious. I would expect to encounter this in a trendy five-star restaurant in LA or San Francisco, NOT in Chandler AZ.  Ahi Salad -- again this is amazing. Again my benchmark is the ahi salad at the Yard House. Again this salad rules all. The ahi is an actual steak 6 inches long, an inch and a half wide and almost an inch thick. Unbelievable. Unbelievable  taste sensation. Wonderful presentation!!! Beautiful!!!!!! The Dessert -- OK. Every restaurant in America now has a fresh-baked cookie with vanilla ice cream on it.  This cookie is mounted on a base of dark chocolate. Then a hard frozen scoop of gourmet vanilla ice cream goes on top. Then it is drizzled and presented. Once again, unique presentation in all of Phoenix. Once again, Incredible taste sensation! Once again, a medley of tastes that paralyze you in thought.  Like I said, I think this is the best restaurant currently operating in the Phoenix area of it's type bar none.  If you think you know of a better restaurant please reply to this post so that I can try it out!!!!!! Please!!!! In the meantime, Congratulations to Doug Collins, owner, and to his genius innovator, Chef Mark."}
{"text":"The wings are probably the best i have ever had, cooked to crispy golden i really recommend garlic parmesan, even the fries were cooked to fresh and hot. The service was great and our server acted like family. 5/5"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and super friendly service.  Food was good and a good beverage selection.   I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here and the food is awesome! Jackson and his staff are always such a pleasure to see. Great place for everyone! The new lunch menu has so many delicious options. Thanks Jackson"}
{"text":"My husband and I always enjoy the food here. It's our \"go-to\" place when we go out. The food has really improved and we love their new menu. There are a lot more choices. Plus the food they served before the menu expansion has really improved. It must be the new chef. We tried a number of dishes and so far they have not disappointed. Service is always good. Today Kaitlyn served us. She was being trained but was pleasant and did a great job."}
{"text":"The pesto deviled eggs were unique, tasty and a fairly decent price.  My wife and I both had wraps; they were both OK but not great - yet the price was pretty high considering the quality.  My daughter had an incredibly expensive salmon dish but did not finish it.  Not sure if we are going back..."}
{"text":"Last night was my first visit at Ginger Monkey.  I was part of a large group (about 20) so we really tested out not only their food, but their service.  With a group as large as ours something is going to go wrong.  So when a few things did go wrong it was great to see them handle it immediately and sincerely.    I had the small Cesar Salad and the Buffalo Mac n Cheese.  Both were excellent and I would have again.  One friend shared his hummus which was surprisingly spicy!  Another friend shared her Surf and Turf Nachos which also go on the must get again list.    Another item I feel worth mentioning...  I pulled into the parking lot and the majority of the parking spots were in the shade thanks to all the tall trees."}
{"text":"The atmosphere has potential, however, the food is over-priced and mediocre and the service is HORRIBLE! We've given this place a couple of tries because it's close to our home and I want to like it, but I don't think we'll be returning after this last visit. The waiter asked us what we wanted to drink, brought my wife's beer but not my iced tea. Asked him about it, still didn't get it so I settled for water. He then commented on our great appetizer choice of the crispy Brussel sprouts and he never entered the order and after about 35 min. brought our entrees out. Drink glasses were never filled without flagging someone down multiple times. I guess all the wait staff were too busy giggling and eating cupcakes at the servers station...SO TACKY! When asked how everything is I mentioned the forgotten appetizer and our waiter told us hopefully he does better next time. It was comical and unprofessional. Pretty much save your money and get much better quality food for the price and craft beer at San Tan Brewery or AZ Wilderness (where they shamelessly ripped off their duck fat fries, which are no where comparable). My prediction...they'll be close in 6 months."}
{"text":"Firstly, I'm Soo happy that I found this place. The food is great and great prices for happy hour. If you go here you must ask for the waitress Heather!!  She really takes of you with the best attitude and efficiency. She made my choice the best one.  Please visit and support this business!  Fun times and great atmosphere. All for Heather!  Thanks for reading. Good bless"}
{"text":"This is my favorite neighborhood bar. Stan and Tiffany are amazing. Live music...food and drinks can't beat!"}
{"text":"We have been several times since they opened... Surf & turf nachos, buffalo mac & cheese, crab cakes are all fantastic! The bartenders, Lauren and Deklan, very personable. This will be our new hangout!"}
{"text":"This place has potential, but it has issues.  For one, they no longer serve everything on the menu.  Why not just print up new ones?  Also, they have seriously rescinded their bar offerings.  That's why I go there.  I'm not sure why the bartenders still can't make the old drinks.  Don't they still have all of the basic ingredients?  Why does the food take so long to be delivered?  We've been there when its busy and slow.  The service seems to be getting worse.    I'd like the place to succeed, but its struggling."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special at all. Basic bar food, and sticky counter tops. I was hopeful, as it is close by and I really wanted this to be better than it was, however it is about on par with Hooters, except the staff is better dressed and they have lots more RBF and attitude."}
{"text":"Amazing service.  Brunch was absolutely delicious.  Lauren the bartender is friendly and extremely attentive.  Great and comfortable bar stools.  Nice ambiance. And heated toilet seats.  All around awesome place.  Dog friendly too"}
{"text":"We visited here for the first time on New Year's Eve with the kids. They were prepared for a large crowd, but it wasn't very busy when we were there. It's a cool place and yes the bathroom is no exception. They also have lots of games making it a very family friendly. The food was good. My husband loved his burger. He said it was simple but delicious. My daughter and I ordered the TV dinners which were served on cool metal trays. I enjoyed my meal, but next time I will try something different. Overall, good food, a nice atmosphere, reasonable prices and good service.  We will add this to our list of our usual hangouts."}
{"text":"First time at this newly opened restaurant.  Great service, very pleasant atmosphere.  The menu is not for everyone.  Their wings were excellent.  The drinks were good size.  Plenty of TV's.  I would recommend that you visit this restaurant and see if the menu is right for you.  Leave the kids at home."}
{"text":"I recently came to Ginger Monkey and everything was great! I was a first time customer and I know for sure I will definitely be coming back! I recommend getting the spaghetti meal, it was delicious and the meatballs were mildly spicy but still tasty!"}
{"text":"This place is a future gem of south Chandler. The service is great, the prices are fair and the food is delicious and interesting. We had a large party this evening and the staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a great time. I am so glad they opened up and look forward to coming back for years to come. Thanks Ginger Monkey!!!"}
{"text":"Pork fat fries are the thing to get at this place.  The TV dinner is pretty good as well.  I would pass on the taco Tues tacos though.  This is a fairly new restaurant.  Opened I believe it was October.  They also have a happy hour before 6p with certain appetizers at reduced prices as well.  I loved the pork fat fries.  The carmelized onion gave it a hint of sweetness and the tender shredded pork made it really good.  The fries were hot and crispy when it was delivered to the table. The bacon in it sealed the deal. The tuna poke was pretty good too. Fresh tuna and rice at the right texture was sure to delight your taste buds.  The sauce with the dish was pretty good as well.    I loved the concept of the TV dinner.  It came out on a plate with divided compartments, each with a different type of food, just like a TV dinner.  Meatloaf with bacon (anything with bacon is awesome in my book) was tender and tasty.  It had a bit of carmelization, making it slightly sweet, but not too overpowering.  The creamy corn and mashed potatoes with gravy were tasty as well.  The brownie was ok, not my favorite.  I did like it wasn't too sweet though.    The main menu dishes were pretty good.  They are trying experimental menus like the taco Tuesday. I was really excited to try the cod tacos.  Everything around the fresh cod was good.  However the actually fish was quite mushy.  I would've excpected a bit of crunchiness in the fish instead.  It also tasted a bit bland as well.    I'd be interested in coming back for HH and perhaps try some of their other experimental menus as well.  If anything, I'll come back for the fries."}
{"text":"Ginger Monkey just opened this week and it's been a long awaited event! I have been there twice now: once for dinner, and once for brunch. They are a new restaurant and I completely understand that there are a few kinks in getting used to flows of customers and new staffing. However, I felt that they are doing a great job of being accommodating to these adjustments and are making a conscious effort to be a staple to this area of Chandler.   For dinner, I got a half-portion chopped salad, the pesto deviled eggs (appetizer), and the Hawaiian salmon poke bowl (appetizer). I was very impressed! The deviled eggs I would order any time, any day. The chopped salad was a little more than your typical chopped salad but had a vinaigrette dressing that really made it tie together really well. Poke bowls can be very hit and miss based off quality and the type of marinade used, but this was hands down one of the best poke bowls I've had in Phoenix so far!   Brunch was also great, their menu is pretty wide spread with options and I got the avocado bagel which has a fried egg on top of an avocado spread on a wheat bagel. The bagel was surprisingly fresh and it was a nice healthy option for the breakfast menu. One of my friends got the Biscoff waffle and I had a bite of it and it was also super delicious! As we were there I noticed that it would be a great place to come back to for Sunday football drinks with friends. You could do brunch, then stay in the bar and do drinks until they bring out their dinner menu. Coming back to Ginger Monkey soon!"}
{"text":"Ginger monkeys is a gret place to get your drink fixens. Since the new head chef has taken over the menu has flourished. Jackson and head chef mark are remarkable people...very generous and outspoken individuals. From the lunch menu to the dinner menu deserts and even the late night menu on friday and saturday nights are quite evolved. I recommend this establishment 10 fold. It's a  fun place for the whole family even your canine friends. This is a must place to visit if you havent already. I give it 5 stars because the staff and the food is rockstar status keep it up guys your on the right track to success"}
{"text":"I'm giving the experience we had this morning for brunch 3 Stars and want to be completely fair so let me explain as I don't want to impact anyone's decision to try this restaurant out for lunch, dinner or happy hour.   We've eaten here during happy hour and it was awesome - the reason i am giving it 3 stars instead of 2. The food was great and so was the service. This alone will bring us back for happy hour.   Today, for brunch, the service was awesome! They had $5 bloody Mary's which my husband was happy about. We were the only ones there on a Saturday morning around 10am. However, it was disappointing because It just feels like they really aren't set up to be a brunch or breakfast place for several reasons, which could've been why we were the only ones there. The reasons are:  1) there was a very small menu of breakfast items 2) the coffee tasted like an afterthought and was not good 3) they only offer half and half for your coffee 4) the menu features creamy breakfast potatoes, which we thought meant something similar to Cracker Barrel's cheesy hash brown potato casserole, but cubed potatoes with onion and peppers is what we got, which were actually good but we wanted the creamy potatoes darn it! 5) The spoon they served with the coffee was dirty 6) the half and half provided for the coffee was curdled (but was fine the second time once the guy brought me some new stuff) 7) no salt and pepper on the table and the eggs needed a little salt  Again, won't go back for breakfast because they aren't really a breakfast place but their regular menu and food is good and the physical building and set up is great!"}
{"text":"Was on vacation visiting from Hawaii and really enjoyed this place. The patio is amazing along with the staff"}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to play catchup and she told me we needed to head to this quirky establishment.  First off, the story behind the name is inspired by the owners. The wife is a ginger and I guess her husband is hairy which lead to the monkey comment. Love how the name came to be and the restaurant looked inviting.  We sat on the patio and the weather was gorgeous! We took our time ordering drinks and food but our waiter Jason was very welcoming. We asked his suggestions and he named a few of his favorites. I got a mixed drink and was blown away that it tasted so good. I almost thought there was no alcohol in it but I took a few more sips and tasted it. It was blended that good, I was surprised. My friend got a beer and they had quite a few beers on tap.  I wasn't starving so I ordered the surf and turf nachos. The nachos were huge that even sharing the dish, i had to let some pieces go. The sauce on the nachos combined with the different meats was good. The short rib had a great taste and blended with the nachos.  My friend ordered the brussel sprouts and as someone who hates them, they were edible and pretty good. She also ordered the wings which were alright but I loved my nachos so much more. Finished off the night with a Kahlua root beer float. This was so good, just make sure you mix it all as the alcohol separates when its been sitting.  Overall it was such a relaxing atmosphere. We got our food quick, the service was super good and the noise level was perfect for just catching up on life. Jason would talk to us when his tables were gone and he made the experience even better. We will be back again as I heard I missed the cool bathroom that my friend told me we had to check out."}
{"text":"This place is the best! The food is amazing and the ambiance is perfect. Loads of delicious beers on tap. I had the chianti braised short rib and it was unreal! Full of flavor and the meat was so tender. I love the fact that we can bring our dogs on the patio - they brought water for the dogs and even a dog menu. Had the key lime tart for dessert and was just blown away.  Creamy and tart at the same time - beautiful texture - absolutely perfect!"}
{"text":"Loved it!!  Had the maple chipolte wings and they were amazing.  Great atmosphere, service and menu....Definitely will be our new go to for Sunday Football."}
{"text":"Husband and I went on a Friday night, not much going on there even with NBA playoff game on.  Atmosphere is cool, servers and staff very friendly and attentive.  I ordered a cocktail, husband got wine.  Cocktail seemed under poured and wine wasn't a glassful.  Food was alright, basic bar food.  Will probably go back during football season.  It is in convenient location and more adult oriented than \"family friendly\"  which we prefer."}
{"text":"The ultimate brownie was amazing. Service was good, music was good. Nice place. Would come back"}
{"text":"Great place for date night, family night, or night out with friends! We've been several times and each time had a great time. The food is delicious: we've had appetizers, happy hour, and dinner.  Patio area great too with heaters and fire bar.  Owners have given south chandler/ocotillo residents a place we can finally go out and enjoy!  Add this place to your line up of places to go."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and layout! Great happy hour pricing! The patio is very nice and includes a fire place and fire table. The food selection is more diverse than most sports bars, but lacking in options. I'd like to see more things on happy hour or the menu in general. I'd have given it five stars but the service was realllllly slow. The poor girl was training a new employee and seemed to be covering 80% of the place! It wasn't her fault at all but we had to wait forever for more drinks, etc. but, this may be home they keep HH drafts down to $2.50! Pro tip: Order two at a time or rapid fire. Cool vibe... can't wait to do a guy night here with the boys and play some of video games, etc."}
{"text":"I was in town for business and found this place. Amazing staff. Totally took care of us. At the end of our meal the owners came out and had a drink with us. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I only gave it 3 stars because we went on opening night which was a huge mistake.  The kitchen was backed up for 2 hours. It was good food though and we will try again."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place yet let me tell you, you are missing out. The menu has a great variety to please any palate. Our favorites are the Surf & Turf Nachos, Duck Fries and the chipotle wings! This has become our go to place when we want to meet up with friends and now they're hooked as well.  Great job Doug & Jackson!"}
{"text":"Seriously the BEST food we've had in a LONG time & COLDEST beers - 1* from slushy! Wow! 2nd time here & ahhhmazing! Ignore the few bad reviews, those snobs have no idea what good good is...this place is the real deal! We're sharing Wings & loaded duck fat fries again - both are to die for! !  Today we're having those & Hubby is having the ahi tuna burger & grilled turkey panini for me! YUM! Perfect for my \"last meal\" before back in my diet! Ha! Excellent service & no issues whatsoever! Big screen TV's in the bar & great music playing! We love this place & will be back every week!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and has been both times I have been here. Tonight the staff was aweful and the food took almost 45 minutes to come out. We were only 5 people and we all ordered burgers and they weren't that busy. No hostess at the stand when we got there and when a hostess came up she was rude. A restaurant can only get by on good food for so long. After our food came and we ate I noticed the staff were all hanging out in the kitchen on cell phones. I hope this post helps them get better service and leads to a better customer experience."}
{"text":"Service was decent. Food was ok but the lettuce in my salad wasn't even cut. I'm talking a full leaf of lettuce. But the real issue is with the artwork. Super political and anti American imho. I had to stare at this my entire meal. I like to go to a restaurant for good food, not to have someone's political ideals shoved down my throat."}
{"text":"Food is incredible! The salmon, prawns and wings are some of the best we've eaten! But what is more impressive than the food are the owners Jackson and Doug who come and personally meet their customers. This is our new Chandler favorite!"}
{"text":"Loved the new menu items and the band was great! The manager discussed the changes with our table and seemed genuinely concerned that we had a good experience. Love that they help out the Chandler community! Will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"Large St Patties day party that seems unorganized plus no corned beef on the event menu. How can you have a party on St Patties day without corned beef?"}
{"text":"Great owners. Sweet bartenders. Awesome food and great beer selection. And according to my girl friend best women bathroom \"toilets. As a \"carwash\" without the wax"}
{"text":"This has to be my new Fav' spot in Phoenix! Came for Happy Hr & this place did NOT disappoint! Great Happy Hr food w/awesome beer & cocktail selection! The staff & service were beyond exceptional! This bar in Chandler has IT all & can't wait to return for a game nite as this Tavern has TV's & best outdoor patio seating ever! Had some if the best wings I've ever had, along w/awesome desserts too! 5stars from me"}
{"text":"Still hit or miss with service and food. I like the deviled eggs and surf and turf nachos, but just meh on everything else. I had the TV dinner. It pretty much tasted like one - meaning nothing special and the metal tray got cold really fast so my food did too. The buffalo chicken Mac and cheese was just ok too. Needed way more blue cheese and chicken for that matter. I really want to like this more. The bar type food is fine. It's when you get something other than apps that it goes wrong. However....The manager is VERY nice. When she checked on us - you actually believe she wants to know."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this new place.  I went in on Friday night a little before 7.  I sat at the bar, and originally had to wait for service.  I was almost ready to leave when one of the 7 bartenders finally noticed me and took my order.  After that, It was great.  The staff is super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Our dogs love it. Our kids love it. Good food,  kid menu, dog menu. Great service and patio. Natalie rocks and so do her bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"My guest and I walked in to a nearly-empty dining room at lunch and waited quite a while for someone to come seat us. This seemed to happen to every group that came in after us as well. The service was also slow. I am wondering whether the restaurant was stuck in an in-between time on a holiday where it was not busy enough to have more employees working, but it was still too much for a single waitress to handle. Our waitress was friendly, so I don't blame her at all. It just seems like the restaurant management needs to work some things out.  As for the food, it was a little underwhelming. Both my guest and I thought that the food was fine, but nothing particularly special. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich. The chicken looked good, and it was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The problem was that there wasn't really much spice at all. The toppings sounded good on the menu, but didn't add much to the flavor. The fries had an odd, burnt taste.  I may return if I'm in the area. They have many menu options at good prices, and the bar area is pretty nice."}
{"text":"First time there this Friday night. I enjoyed their Happy Hour to start and I zoomed in on Burgers. This was the first burger I've had in a while that everything on the burger coordinated together as a great taste. I had a special request as a transplant patient and wow, did the waitress and chef help to make it right. It will be one of my favorites in Chandler."}
{"text":"The place I work is very close by, so I find myself here often.  The servers and bartenders couldn't be more sweet!  The kitchen is usually pretty lenient on substitutes and the dishes are consistent.  I've found, personally, that some of the food is definitely better than other dishes, but have never had anything flat out BAD.  The bathrooms are clean, there is plenty of floor space (super ada friendly), and the outdoor seating is nice.  Bring your dog!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to roll on a Sunday morning after church, pop a molly and head over to Ginger Monkey. The DJ plays the best 2000s garbage between football games so you and the family can #rage. But really... the DJ is not a good choice."}
{"text":"We come here every week and we love it! The service is decent but the food is phenomenal! Buffalo chicken mac, surf n turf nachos, tacos, spicy sriracha chicken sandwich are some of my favorites. Happy hour is great!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best kept secrets in Chandler. There is nothing on the menu that will disappoint you. The craft beer selection is one of the best around. Must have is the Brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Staff is awseme, highly recommended! Nice variety on menu. King pau wings are really good. Good for families or a night out."}
{"text":"Oh my...so I wanted to try this place again since I've only been here one other time.  And sadly, this will be the last...I get it,they were busy but seriously we ordered a bottle of wine and our waitress brought it to the table, set it down and walked away. Thankfully it was a screw top so we were able to open it ourselves, but where was the service since we had to open and pour it ourselves?? Huh Ok so as the evening progressed our service was better but the flies got worse.  And still, our server never poured one glass of wine...not even a refill. Overall this place has ok food, ok atmosphere (although a little loud) and ok service. Just bring your flyswatter with you if you want to protect your food."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has 4 stars. We went there on a Saturday afternoon at about 2:30. There were a few people in the bar area and maybe 2 tables in the main area. First impression was great. It's very open and has a great patio area for when the weather is nice. They also have a good beer selection, however they don't have a cocktail menu which we thought was a bit odd. We started off with the wings and they were breaded and had kind of a funky tasting sauce. We don't think wings should ever be breaded until they're boneless so we didn't really like them. I then had the crabby patty and he got the short rib manicotti. The crab cake smelt really fishy and had no flavor, and he's manicotti was very heavy and again not very flavorful.  It might be a better place at night if you're just looking for a cool place to grab some drinks, but not food."}
{"text":"The only thing good was the music. Service was horrible. Table was sticky and dirty. Waited about 5 min for someone to come and say hello and seat us. There was a wait for a table but found a open table at the bar. Place was busy but not crazy. Waiter came over after about 2-3 min of us sitting. Took 2 of our 3 drink orders. We asked for a drink menu for the 3rd drink. Just over 20 min went by before the guy came back with our drinks. Never brought the menu over and so as he delivered we decided to leave. Went across the way to Blue 32. Our server Regal was outstanding!!! Quick service and good food. Will never go back to the Ginger Monkey."}
{"text":"Hostess seated us then no one came over to our table! I went to the bar to order and the two female bartenders just continued to chat entirely ignoring me! We left.........very sad new place was going to help them out!  Off to Beer Research Institute  Tried it again! No good!!"}
{"text":"Food was bland.  They had live music that put me to sleep.  The girl was playing Arms of the Angel . All I could think about was the SPCA commercial. Saving some dogs for just a dollar a day.  Would have rather spent the dollar on saving the dog than the food ."}
{"text":"We tried the Ginger Monkey for the first time Tuesday night. We had a group of 14 people. The service was good, but somewhat disappointed because the food was not hot when served. Must have sat on the kitchen counter for a short time. More than likely won't be back since we have so many other choices. Also, the draft beer is too expensive. Six dollars for a Kiltlifter?"}
{"text":"Natalie is the bomb! Took care of me all afternoon Hungry? Thirsty? Definitely come here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I take our 2 labs here frequently, love that they allow dogs on the patio, our dogs love it too (they get so much attention!).  The food is pretty standard bar food, but they need more burger and appetizer options.  People aren't going here for the food, they go for the atmosphere, so instead of trying to do gourmet, do basic, and do it right.  We recently went on my birthday, which was a Friday, the patio was crowded, and there seemed to be only 2 servers out there.  Our server messed up our appetizer order, didn't take our dinner orders and never brought my husband's drink.  We waited over 30 minutes before I was fed up.  I found the manager, Patty, and explained what was going on, especially since it was my birthday.  She personally came over, took our orders, fixed the appetizer, had my husband's beer out in minutes, and she took care of our entire bill.  Their service may be lacking when it comes to the waitstaff, but Patty is a great manager, and knows how to make things right.  Will definitely keep going, it has a lot of potential, just gotta iron out a few glitches."}
{"text":"I never never paid so much for so little. Stay away from the meatball appetizers. Has potential if the food was better and the prices were cheaper."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the rave reviews are about here. I was thoughly disappointed. The duck fat fries for $14 were thrown down in front of me half burned without care by our bar server. When I went through get. A drink the blonde bartender acted like it was not her job to actually serve me. This place has potential but unfortunately they have too many internal problems that I am not sure will be solved. Good food and good service are at the top of my list and neither of those were met. I hope they can work through their internal problems so they can thrive."}
{"text":"Oh man I wanted to like this place so badly especially being a Broncos bar but my kids and I left very disappointed. The service was okay; our server had little personality but he got the job done. The bathrooms are pretty but needed a good cleaning. The food was disappointing to say the least. I got the crab cakes which was suppose to come with arugula and a lemon aioli. The arugula on my plate was wilted, the lemon aioli was reddish pink in color and spicy.. not lemony at all. The crab cakes were unappealing visually (see picture) and soggy. Taste was okay but not good enough to take the rest home. My kids didn't eat much of their food either. My sons chicken fingers were over cooked on the ends he couldn't even eat them. He said the ranch didn't taste good and this kids eats a lot of ranch at a lot of places. Overall the experience was underwhelming. There are so many amazing food experiences that I'd want to spend $40 on this is not one I will spend that on again, sorry."}
{"text":"Disappointed  Sunday  afternoon 10/9/16 . We arrived at the Ginger Monkey excited to try this new place we have heard  about. We were greeted by 4 girls 2 opening the door and 2 at the hostess station.  It was open and spacious and great decor.  We went to sit on the patio but unfortunately smokers were out on the patio and the stench of cigarette smoke filled the air of both areas of the patio.We could not even sit at any tables near the patio because the cigarette smoke bellowed in. We went back to the hostess station and were immediately seated.  The bar area was full but the restaurant area was wide open. Hardly anyone inside the restaurant area. Which I was excited that the hostes sat us immediately. Unfortunately, We sat and we waited ...... And waited ..  A group of 3 were seated across  and after us. They were helped and drinks served before our waitress came over to address the two of us.  Yet 4 hostesses were standing at the podium chit chatting....Usually with a new restaurant the service is usually on  point....      We were asked. What we would like to drink, I asked if they had a drink  menu she gave us one and left.  She came back after some time to take our drink order... We were advised it was happy hour with $1 off all beers and $2 off all menu items with a monkey next to it. We were excited about that and thought what a perfect opportunity to try an array of foods to see what we like.  We ordered a couple of things based on the happy hour specials.  We ordered the Kung pao calamari....Greek flat bread, grilled Brussel sprouts and one of the burgers well done.   After a very very long time and 2 beers later the waitress advised that some of the food was ready. She was kind and asked if we wanted her to bring out the food that was ready or to bring all the food out at the same time .   Of course bring it out now... We were hungry and excited to try the food.  She brought out the Kung pao calamari....omg simply amazing .. The absolute best calamari I have had...... The Greek flat bread was not that great it was suppose to have a feta spread with kalamata olives and spinach there was a pile of spinach but the feta spread was lacking..it is ok because those calamari were the bomb. They brought out the grilled Brussel sprouts with bacon and a bit of cheese...amazing... These were incredible...  We were pretty happy...  After 45 min the burger finally came.... It looked amazing.... After a bite the inside was completely raw.. Even the server looked at it and said that doesn't look like well done at all... It was sent back... We finished the Brussel sprouts and the calamari.. Greek flatbread was untouched.. Do not recommend..  My friends burger came and she ate a few bites and it was amazing... We ordered the dessert the Oreo cookie made with  chocolate and  topped with vanilla ice cream......wow it was fantastic....  We got our bill and noticed the beer and food were not discounted.. I mentioned to the waitress and she looked it over and apologized.  She came back and advised that she made a mistake and just the beers were on special and not the food. Sorry..... Is all she said.. Part of our order was based on the fact that the food with the monkey was $2 off. Granted only 2 items that we ordered had the monkey and it was only $4 dollars .She did fix the error on the beers we ordered. She even apologized again and said I hope the food was good enough to overlook all the mistakes.  Wow....   Had to wait for a waitress...misquoted prices, long wait for the burger and it had to be sent  back because it was a raw burger...not even  a I'm sorry ..or free dessert or honor what the waitress quoted..?...I understand mistakes but no other apologies or a discount.  A sincere apology would  have been nice.. Our meal and drinks werre roughly $78  for just 2 of us not including tip..  I don't mind paying that when the food and service are good......   I am very disappointed,...... I might be back for those calamari but that's about it...."}
{"text":"Came here on Mother's Day for the first time and am extremely disappointed. Took 45 minutes for our food to come and it wasn't very busy. My salmon was over cooked and on the verge of being cold. Server was apologetic and comped  the meal, which I appreciate, but can't say I'd return."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the service was fantastic! Love the duck fries and Brussels sprout apps. Excellent pork belly and manicotti! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Kind of hard to review, because the food and layout were both very good.  The bar and open air atmosphere was well designed and the decor is also very nice.  The problem was the service.  I would say the service was the worst I have had in several months.  It was slow, the staff was aloof and there was a point where we had food and no silverware for an extended period of time even after asking multiple servers for assistance.  I want to go back... But don't plan on doing so until I hear the service is improved."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service was good and the food was great as well. Our second time to visit GM and we will for sure be back.  Also a bonus it's Bronco friendly!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for a late lunch and sat on the dog-friendly patio. Even pretty empty of patrons, the patio was crowded and somewhat difficult to navigate to our table. I can't imagine getting through the chairs if the were filled with people and not pushed under the tables. A bit more space between tables would be very welcome.   The food was very good. We split the 3-cheese roasted garlic flatbread. It was just crispy and soft enough, carrying a gooey topping of tasty cheeses, with just enough garlic to know it is there, but not so much to be overpowering.   My wife had candied walnut and apple salad. She thought it was very tasty, with the vinaigrette nicely complementing the spinach, bleu cheese crumble, pancetta, walnuts and apples.   I had the Crabby Patty. The blue crab jumbo lump crab cake was unexpectedly large, bigger than most burgers. The crab was sweet and crisped up nicely. The arugula and tomato with siracha aioli filled in the flavorful sandwich. The only disappointment were the French fries. While hot when they arrived, they were pretty limp. They could use a decent crisping.  The menu is pretty diverse. It was a bit tough to make a choice. We will be back again, to try some other items!"}
{"text":"We went tonight after the regrand opening. The atmosphere was really nice and the live music was great. When we sat our waiter offered us a beer that had been left behind at another table. This should have been our first sign something was wrong. Our waiter continued to display erratic behavior. He was either really overworked or high. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"We have tried to like this place. After 5 attempts, it just keeps getting worse. Finally giving up. The service and food are horrible. Today, the waitress/bartender said we would need to give her our teenagers order because she doesn't like kids and didn't want to talk to them! Serious?? It took a hour and half to get food. It came out one at a time and by the time everyone had food, the first person was already done eating. Then of course they apologize and comp items. Not sure how long they can stay in business doing that, but on the other hand, they need to keep people from losing it. They are always out of food and drinks. You are a bar, how can you be out of beer and alcohol? We asked if they could put the Dbacks game on one TV and on our way out, they finally found someone that could change the channel. The two tables next to us, got up and left without even getting their food because it took so long."}
{"text":"We went to the Ginger Monkey on a Saturday night at about 6pm. We were seated immediately. We ordered the cheese flatbread as an appetizer. Came out fairly quick and was very good. The  server was kind of slow to take the order, but the Cheeseburger/fires were pretty good. Overall a very positive visit. The menu is limited, so I would like to see if that expands."}
{"text":"Great up scale place to try new beer and great food! The executive chef is one of a kind greatness in adding his own touch of originality to all the dishes."}
{"text":"Patio is awesome, beer selection impressive and plenty of options on the menu. The service has been extremely poor every time I have visited. Even when slow the service has been poor."}
{"text":"Went there last Saturday to listen to my son's band. Cool bar and restaurant. Good place to chill. But the service is very slow. Doesn't seem organized. We had to track down someone to bus our table and they did half the table and never came back. Food took a long time. The main courses were good. Tried the meatball appetizer for $12. Got 4 small meatballs and a half a piece of garlic bread. Seemed way overpriced. The rest of the food seem fair priced and it tasted good."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa was like chunky tomato sauce. Very bland and tasteless.  The hamburger was fair but Zipps is a lot better. The fries could be excellent if they were fried longer and made crispy and not soggy.  The seasoning is good but spicy. The spicy chicken sandwich is served with the skin on it I guess and the chicken was not tender as all. Piece of chicken was smaller than the bun.  The staff is friendly I just wish the food was better.  Zipps has this place beat in about every way!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting patiently for Ginger Monkey to open in the venue that was Whiskey Rose. Over the course of the summer we have met with owners and watched their progress. We live right around the corner. So tonight was the grand opening and I can say they have exceeded our expectations. The decor and ambiance is terrific. The servers are all very friendly and accommodating.  After a cocktail we ordered the deviled egg appetizer which was very good. We also ordered the angus burger to split. Took 45 minutes to get our burger, but it was well worth the wait! Very juicy and tender and the bacon was outstanding. Despite typical opening night jitters and adjustments, we were very pleased with the service and quality of the food. Just great! We will be back often. Update: we have where others have been less than favorable in their reviews. I would suggest that they consider that this business is going through a grand opening and working out the kinks. Be reasonable."}
{"text":"Hoping that this place would be different than the previous businesses that failed in this location. Went there after work and waited over an hour for 12 wings only to find out that they weren't even up to our order yet. we cancelled the order and finished our beers that took forever to get and left. We went back again for lunch because we work in the area only to find out that they aren't open for lunch. It would be nice if they had hours of operation or ANY sign on the door to let you know this. I understand they just opened but they didn't seem prepared.   We probably wont be headed back anytime soon. We also now have bets at work how long they will remain open. The over\under is set at 4 months. Also their link is broken..http://www.gingermonkeyaz.com/--good luck monkey"}
{"text":"Went there for some drinks and appetizers this evening. Took over 2 hours to get to of the happy hour appetizers. No staff to greet us at the door. Very poor Service as there was no one in the restaurant and very few in the bar. This will be my first time and last time going to this establishment"}
{"text":"Well, I am so damn easy to please. All I ask is for a well poured drink in a cushy leather bar seat and some good music. AND BAM! There I am at the GM enjoying just that and a whole lot more.   This neighborhood joint opened up a few months ago and I finally got to visit twice. Both times, I sat at the inside bar, which features large comfy leather chairs you might find in someone's home. The bartenders are very accommodating and fast with your pour. Just what you want in someone handling your liquor ;)  Each time, I had the nachos, which has the most mouth watering short ribs and shrimp, covered in a special sauce drizzled all over the nachos, with cheese and I don't even know what else but it's AWESOME!!! My aunt and uncle have been here on my recommend, and she had the ahi tuna. I don't know what my uncle had but they both loved their meals, all of it. They found the place packed on a Friday night around 7. I'm smart and get there at 3 or 4, so I can drink in relative peace, eat my entire nachos plate without a bunch of good looking guys around making me self conscious, and get home before the amateur drinkers start leaving.   The vibe is cool, down to earth like one of the owner's I met, the \"monkey\" of the 2 male owners. I don't know why he is \"monkey\", but he's very nice. Chats up the bar, and makes sure everyone is at the minimum level of enjoyment. Hey, you gotta bring your own party, there's only so much the owner's can do.  So score big for Chandler! It's worth the drive. Not every fabulous place is located in downtown anymore. There's an outdoor bar and patio too. Me likey :)  See you at the bar. I'm the chick at the end, digging in my nachos like it's my only meal of the day. Which, it pretty much is.   ps. LOVE the bathrooms!!! Each stall is completely enclosed like it's own little throne. So pretty too!"}
{"text":"Made it to Ginger Monkey for the first time on Thursday night for my dog's fourth birthday. Yes, you read that correctly. Moving on...The customer service experience at this restaurant is a rare gem! Everyone was so inviting to my mother, my boyfriend and I, and especially welcoming to my furry son. They were so great about playing along with my antics and even comped his birthday meal. He had ordered the \"hambarker helper\" off the dog menu, which he said was delicious. ;) The patio is very lovely with plenty of heaters and televisions. As for the food...I honestly wouldn't recommend the meatballs. They were a bit of a miss...But the braised short ribs, the deviled eggs, the duck fat fries, and the caramelized onion flatbread were all very tasty! To top our evening off, the staff even all gathered to sing happy birthday to my spoiled boy. Thanks to the amazing folks at the ginger monkey, we had an amazing evening and an even better story!"}
{"text":"We where driving buy and thought we would stop in and grab some dinner.  We stood in the door way for 10 min before stepping fully into the restaurant. The only people in front of us was a family of four that finally where seated. After 5 more min went by we left. Not one person even asked or offered to help. There where 2 staff members standing there the hole time. So disappointed. I think a hostess should always be at the front to help customers."}
{"text":"Great open bar Craft beer on tap Cozy and fun Good food Amazing bar seats Toilets in women's bathroom!!!! Must try!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and atmosphere. Good food and drinks. I would come back and back again. I seriously have nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"I really, really want to like this place. I've been here several times for girls night out HH's, one being right after they first opened. The server was a mess, and we ended up being comped a few things. I figured it was just opening issues and would get better. We went on two more occasions and had pretty much the same experiences. After being invited to attend their VIP event, my husband and I decided to try it again. It was supposed to be from 6-830pm, with free samples of their new menu items and drinks. We arrived at 6pm, so it was quite chaotic with lots of the attendees arriving at the same time. People weren't sure if we had to wait to be seated, since the normal sign that states just that remained, so you would think the girls at the door would tell us to just pick anywhere to sit, but we had to ask. Then we sit down and just look around awkwardly for 5 minutes, before my husband asked if we had a server or how it worked.  A guy who was offering a drink sample, which was tasty, said we should have one, but he didn't know who or where they were. He said he could get our drink order, but my husband ordered a beer and then he disappeared and never came back. The next guy we asked said he didn't know what was on happy hour as far as drinks \"because I wasn't really scheduled to work tonight.\"  We were there from 6-750pm, and were only offered a sample of hummus in a cup. We were offered several little shot glasses of the new drinks, but were disappointed that we didn't get to try any other samples of food. We ordered the duck fat fries, which were good, but my husband pointed out they would be much better if they layered the toppings since the rest were just plain fries. We also ordered what was supposed to be the happy hour 1/2 portion of the surf n turf nachos. When they arrived, the plate seemed huge so I asked the server who delivered them if they were the 1/2 order on the HH menu and he said \"I don't know, it's my first day.\" Sigh. When we got the bill, they indeed had the $14 price instead of the HH $5. The server said they had just changed the menu, so he didn't know there was a HH portion. The manager, Patty, did come over and speak to me and ended up just taking the nachos off completely, which I appreciated. The kicker? I noticed that the menu says well drinks are $4 for HH. I had ordered a well vodka cran but was charged $4.50. I know .50 isn't a big deal, but when I asked the server about the discrepancy, he said cranberry is a .50 up charge.  I almost laughed. Are you kidding me?  I order that drink everywhere on well HH's and have NEVER been upcharged for cranberry juice. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I was again disappointed by the service. The food is good, but when the service is consistently subpar, we choose another location when there are so many other choices."}
{"text":"Made a last-minute decision to head over to Ginger Monkey last night with my husband for an impromptu date night. So glad we did! The large rollup doors were open to the outside patio and the extra long fire pit was lit up nicely. On top of that, classics from the 70s and 80s were playing overhead at just the right volume. It almost didn't matter what we had to eat, the ambiance was perfect. We chose the short rib manicotti and the vegetable risotto and were not disappointed at all. Very tasty and beautifully presented. Very nice selection of beer on tap and they came in nice cold glasses. Our waitress, Heather, was fantastic! I only wish The menu had a few more options. It is quite limited."}
{"text":"We went in for dinner on a Sunday anticipating having a good evening and good meal. I ordered a ribeye steak and  immediately informed they had sold out at 6pm. Ok listening to music having cocktails. I decided I would changed my mind no big deal. Playoff game on . I asked the waiter why did they turn on the volume to the game? I was informed a customer who is a friend of the manager wanted the sound to the game on. All though other people complained. I hope that one friend will bring revenue to sustain your business. Very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Great new neighborhood restaurant! I've only eaten here once but was pleasantly surprised. Their beer selection is by far the best in town! I am excited for the weather to cool down so I can enjoy their great patio."}
{"text":"I went here on a whim with some friends before a movie. Wow, best decision ever. Duck fat fries?!?! Are you kidding? All of the food we ordered was delicious. Plus, the management and service was great. Thanks for making me look good in front of my friends, Ginger Monkey. I received so much praise for picking this place out. It has a really cool environment too. If I lived closer, this would become a go-to spot for me.  Ps. There's a surprise for ya in the bathroom ;)"}
{"text":"We decided to stop in on a Sunday for brunch while doing errands. $5 mimosas and Bloody Mary's, yay! I had the chorizo hash and a mimosa. The food was excellent, HUGE amount of food (could share), my Mimosa generous and our server Tennessee was so attentive. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place was good. We ordered the surf and turf nachos they were really good. The crabby patty I would not order again. It was good but it wasn't really a crab cake it was more like crab salad. Kinda runny for a crab cake. We also ordered the angus burger it was good the bacon was thick cut. The menu is really creative. Lots of things to try at this place. Another thing about this place that I liked were the bathrooms lol. They have the cutest bathroom and it was clean and had super cute floors and mirrors. I feel like when the bathrooms are clean at a restaurant the kitchen prob is too."}
{"text":"Got sat and our drink orders delivered before being told \"Oh yeah, you can only order like the appetizers, it's cool though\" While waiting for the waiter a cover band the quality of bad karaoke started up. To be fair didn't try the food but seeing as getting the waiter to get a check took forever I don't have the most faith in this place"}
{"text":"Pretty good!  Wanted to try the new place to get some upscale grub while watching the World Series.  Ambiance-great floor plan, seating in the bar, then in the dining room with the open doors, and then outside. We sat in the middle.  Plenty of TV's from every angle.  Servers were a bit spotty, not knowing what the fish special was nor what the Monkey Hour specials were.  Turned out to be $1 off drafts and $2 off select appetizers.  I ordered 1/2 BLT salad-Cesar like but with the most amazing roasted tomato!  Delicious!  I then had the Greek flatbread as an entree. He ordered the Meatloaf TV dinner; unique but not great.  Overall, very creative menu, good food, and so so service."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my wife and son. None of us enjoyed the dinner.  I thought the food was lousy.  The flatbread with chicken was cold and tasteless.  The chicken sandwich was not good. The burger was below average.  The bar and patio looked nice.  Would go back for drinks but would not touch the food again."}
{"text":"Amazing place! These guys know how to run a restaurant. Very reasonably priced. Tvs everywhere. And did someone say duck fat fries!?!? Yes please! Also try the short ribs with the risotto! Can't wait to come back and explore the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Crab cake and salad were inedible. Crabcake tasted spoiled, left it on the plate. Salad was slimy and wilted. Didnt eat anything. 3 beers on the menu were either out or they didnt have them which of course is understandable but because of the bad food I won't be back."}
{"text":"Waited for 10 min no server no recognition and we were seated there so they knew we were there. Place looks nice and is dog friendly but did not even stay for a beer. Hopefully their service gets better"}
{"text":"I love the waitstaff & the new lunch menu is amazing.  Cannot wait for the new dinner menu to come out!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This place is on point, amazing food, great beer selection and amazing service. I'm definitely comeing back. Get the surf and turf nachos."}
{"text":"Met some friends for a late dinner on a Saturday night and we had a great time very nice patio area along with live music. Lots of things to try on their menu the surf n turf nachos & flat bread steak were really good & they have a full bar with a nice selection of beer.  The owner came by and visited with us and gave us samples of beer to try.  Great local place to meet at we hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"We came to watch the  Super Bowl even though the Broncos weren't in it this year. However I would like to sincerely thank the owner as well as his staff for their warm hospitality and great service. The food is outstanding and better than most of the restaurant's in Chandler we come here often and plan to continue. It's great for family functions or just date night you can even bring your 4 legged friend and sit out in their patio area they have great dishes for the them as well. Thank you Ginger Monkeys for being a part of the community"}
{"text":"This is a high class, we'll run sports bar/pub. It is big, nice and has high quality food. The burger was amazing and the salads are great! It has a great atmosphere and the restrooms are top notch. I will definitely be back, I just wish they had one closer to my house. Great job on this place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, we love the service, and the band that was there was awesome. My favorite dish that they serve is the Poke."}
{"text":"The patio is so cute! Nachos good. Flatbread good. Beer good. Came here to watch the cubs game and it was on point. Good place for a sports bar and love the fire outside!"}
{"text":"Busy afternoon for GM. But Natalie and Monique handled it! Great food! Friendly staff and definitely will be back!!!"}
{"text":"It's a shame. We really wanted to find a great place in South Chandler, but we'll have to keep looking. The one star is for the great location and patio. Aside from that, there's nothing.  Food was ordinary at best. Lackluster and overpriced. Service was awful. Manager was walking around but she seemed not to notice the unfulfilled drink and dinner requests all around. Since when has there been smoking allowed in restaurants?  Patron on the patio with smoke wafting in our direction. Food tasted even worse after that. Nothing seems to last in this location."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it has so many good reviews. We did get seated right away, and everyone was very friendly. Our server took our drink order and was fast with the drinks. Then took a appetizer order, but then didn't take our main dish order until after the appetizers came out. I thought that was odd, and we did have to wait a bit longer then  usual between appetizers and main dish. We had the stuffed mushrooms and calamari to begin with. I thought both of them were ok. My wife thought the calamari was too salty. For the main I had the braised short ribs with risotto and it was good. My wife had the pork belly with rice. The pork belly was extremely fatty and very salty. I'm pretty sure I would have sent back the pork if I ordered it. The kid had wings which were ok, they were meaty, a little soggy, and had a ton of sauce on them. I'm not sure that I will come back for dinner, but would probably do happy hour in the bar area."}
{"text":"Ok so it's a sports bar pub with the bar segregated from the restaurant. It's a Bronco fan favorate and has more than a enough large screen HD tv's. Service is good and attentive. On the app menu we tried the sweet chili habenaro wings  (6)for $7 and (12) for $13. They are crispy on the outside and juicy inside = perfect! The duck fat fries weren't my favorite but the regular frys were decent. The Angus burger was med rare and I asked for med. Didn't much care for the  pre formend bacon on it. The sriacha chicken sandwich  was superb, light and crunchy and a very decent breast. Very clean and comfortable atmosphere and overall a good experience. We will ne back. Go Broncos!"}
{"text":"This place is okay at best. I didn't have anything that was better than average. All the food was mediocre and overpriced. They are still working out their kinks so I will give it another shot in a few months but don't waste your money or time."}
{"text":"Dropped in for dinner last night and ended up staying for the live music. I had the Southwest burger which was delicious.  The patty was well cooked with a nice smoky flavor. After dinner I migrated over to the bar side of the building just as the band was getting started.  The music was eclectic and fun and both the staff and guests were friendly and fun to be around.  Tried a Coffee Kolsch from Hess Brewing and it was awesome, tasted just like iced coffee. Great visit, can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Ginger Monkey is awesome! This staff is amazing. I love the concept and the food is one of the best in Chandler! I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Disappointing. After waiting 50 minutes to have someone acknowledge me, I was ready to leave. My friend approached the manager and let her know. The manager sincerely apologized and promised to \"make it right\". That lasted about 5 minutes. This place is AWFUL!!! Yes, we got a discount. But it wasn't worth it. Worst service EVER.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"We made our reservation for last Friday for 7:00 hoping to try a new restaurant. The reservation was through the tool in Yelp, but go figure the staff does not check their screen thus really we had no reservation. The hostess indicated we would need to wait 25 or 30 minutes even though no one else was waiting. We ended up catching a bite to eat somewhere else. Must be nice to be able to turn business away!"}
{"text":"Service great!!! For the most part food is okay! There was one thing that was totally a disappointment the manicotti no where near what I expected and wouldn't order again! The surf and turf really lacked the good stuff started the above several months ago and forgot about it! Now today had thought try the place again - about 1 pm today - place is dead opened at 11 AM. Tried to order the drunken sea monkeys and the shrimp weren't thawed. Ordered the three cheese flat bread as an alternative not thrilled. Well I had hoped the new owners with the remodel would step it up - creative menu but overall the now four times I've been in here the service was friendly but not into what I've tried good chance my last attempt Okay, ended up having a conversation with Patty and the chef I will be back the shrimp appetizer is very good! We'll give it another try and all I can say if something isn't right speak to a manager! They cannot fix it if they don't know!"}
{"text":"Liked it, food is better than average, obience is good, very clean, nice demographic. Price is about 10 dollars more than most bars, but it is nicer than most bars so worth it."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Food was good.  What is with having to sign and tip electronically while the server  watches you?  Please just leave me a paper copy to sign and tip in peace."}
{"text":"Overall, I was very disappointed. The drinks were overpriced and the food was underwhelming. We went shortly after the grand opening, so I'm willing to forgive some of the hiccups with the service, but even on happy hour it was just very overpriced for what it was. I did really enjoy the surf and turf nachos, but even the burger was very bland. Who ruins a burger?! I want to love this place based on proximity and the nice atmosphere, but I don't envision heading back."}
{"text":"The 4-star is for Tennessee, her exceptional service and I guess for the food. When it finally got to me. Tonight was our first time dining here. The decor was great and ambience was even better. The service is a little slow. Our drinks from the bar took longer than normal.   Despite getting my food 50 minutes later, we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had walked past Ginger Monkey numerous times over the last couple years but never had the time to drop in. Since one of my fellow Elite friends comes here frequently, I knew it had to be a pretty cool place! Paid a visit last weekend and had no clue how good the wings would be! My wife ordered the chicken carbonara pasta and loved it as well. The overall vibe is super chill and from what I've heard they have live music on certain nights. Haven't been for happy hour yet but I'm pretty sure that'll be my next trip as the deals on the awesome craft beer they serve are pretty competitive. That and it's an easy walk from home!"}
{"text":"So many beers on tap, has to be at least 30! Big beer selection and dinner menu. Looks like the happy hour selection is pretty impressive as well. Bartenders are super friendly and quick! Would recommend going, much better than the previous Whiskey Rose"}
{"text":"I have been in here a few times and at first it was amazing. My husband and I had the best time at the bar and the food was great. I still give compliments to the food, but every time we go and sit at the bar the service gets worse and worse. When I go out  I don't want to be made feel like they're doing me a favor by serving me. Last week the two blonde Bartenders acted like they were just there to talk to each other and no one else. I was hoping that this place would last but now they've turned it into a sports bar that is like every other sports bar on every corner combined with the bad service that we have been receiving I don't believe we will be back!"}
{"text":"Got in and seated right away and the service was pretty good. Love the funny videos they play on the TVs. They have great variety of food. We had the Surf N Turf nachos and they were awesome. It's a huge portion. Also tried the tuna poke which fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be way so awesome but its just not there. Almost feel like you have to beg the staff to help you. Didn't try any food because it was too late. Live music from the radio personality Rich from the John Jay and Rich show."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place pretty randomly. Mostly I picked it because of the unique name and it was in a town I was meeting a friend in, but it turned out to be better than expected!   It's in the middle of a strip mall with not too many restaurants, so it got pretty crowded on a Saturday night. The atmosphere was really welcoming, with music, patio lights, and a fire.   I ordered the nachos because 1, it's nachos, and 2, they had shrimp and short ribs on them. YUM! A must try.   They have happy hour during the weekday, and then an additional late night happy hour at night. There was also live music the night I was there, which was great.   Definitely would recommend if you happen to be in Chandler and are looking for a fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Heard raves and wanted to try it. Won't be going back. Too many good places around."}
{"text":"Five stars for private events and catering.  3-ish stars for \"normal\" dining.  I threw my husband's surprise 40th birthday here back in January and worked with Monique, the on-site event coordinator. The process was amazingly easy and affordable, and the party went off without a hitch. We were in excellent hands and the food was amazing. Our server that night was awesome and he kept the drinks coming. I would highly recommend looking into Ginger Monkey for any private party needs. I certainly would use them in the future should the need or occasion arise.   Minus a star for \"normal\" dining experience. We've also eaten here just for lunch or dinner, and the service is pretty slow. Food is good, smaller portions than I'd expect. We have 2 small children, so food coming out quick is pretty important with little hungry tummies, but if you're not in a rush, may be less of a big deal. The drinks are yummy, so we'll be back - just maybe not with impatient kids."}
{"text":"Ginger Monkey is always very accomodating! We have moved our Network meeting to their location and they always take care of our group! If you haven't been there, check them out!"}
{"text":"Went here with my family on a Friday night. Extremely nice host and server. Food was very reasonably priced and good. Nice variety of food for everyone. They have a grabber machine as well! We will definitely eat there again. Thanks!"}
{"text":"What a great place. The drinks were flowing and the food was great. The people were even better!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty slow. Took quite awhile to get a beer that I ordered. Beer was ok, waiter recommended doing the Koffee Kolsh with cream ale which was a good combo. Chips and salsa were, meh (unfortunately, can get better for free at any number of Mexican restaurants) these were an expensive snack costing $5! My husbands wings were ok, and I ordered the Greek Wrap which was also just Ok. I give it 2 stars because I think most are to liberal with star rating, Just my opinion. It was just .. I don't know, not that great. Craft beer list was pretty sad too not much. Very much just sports bar food."}
{"text":"Patty provided me with exceptional service. I needed help with a community fundraiser and Patty quickly stepped up and volunteered to donate to my elementary school.   The three times I have eaten here, I have had great service as well. All employees have warm personalities and have provided great service.  My favorite thing on the menu was the carmalized onion and tomato jam flatbread, it was AMAZING!  All in all, I really like GM and i am glad they are apart of the Chandler community!"}
{"text":"I've been here at least 1/2 a dozen times and am always impressed with the rich and delicious food this place cranks out!  The duck fat fries are incredible.  I've heard the bathrooms are worth every enjoyable minute as well."}
{"text":"Best wings in the East Valley. Brussel sprouts are insane too. Great atmosphere. Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Tried the Ginger Monkey for the first time today with my husband. We started with the Kung Pao Calamari and it was fantastic! Great amount of heat, flavor, and the Calamari itself was very tender! Loved the sauce, aoili, and the bed of cellophane noodles was fun (and added a great crunch!  Entrées:  I had the short rib manicotti and my husband had the pork chop. I don't think I'll be trying any of the other menu items for a while because I am enamored with the manicotti!!! The cheeses are gooey and bring the best flavor combined with the short rib. Seriously, omgogosh on this dish!!  My husband is harder than I am to impress and he was so happy with the pork chop. His exact words were 'top notch.....juicy, flavorful, and the apple, onions, and gravy were right on. The Brussels sprouts = perfection.   Service was good. Not overly friendly but we never wanted for drinks so that was great! The hostess was very welcoming and friendly. A gentleman brought our appetizer out and he was very personable!! (he may have been one of the managers/owners). We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I'm rating three stars because the quality of the food was good. We ordered the surf and turf nachos as an appetizer and had intended on ordering small entrees as well, but the service was poor. Someone other than our server brought out the food and our server was MIA for a long time. We weren't given appetizer plates. By the time the server showed back up 20 minutes after we received our food, we were about done balancing the nacho plate between us. Maybe Kiley was new. If so, she'd better get up to speed quickly or the Ginger Monkey may lose business. We noticed the table next to us was also waiting a long time for service from her."}
{"text":"Good food!  Un-forgettable name, cool atmosphere. I would recommend to a friend for a local bar with good food."}
{"text":"Went in sat for 7 minutes never saw a server well I did they looked at me and never stopped even if I tried to get them to stop. First time here and they aren't that busy and service is horrible."}
{"text":"Extremely bad service and no knowledge of the beer menu. The guy literally didn't know what IPA's they had on draft. Oh did I mention our server didn't check on us for 45 mins and they had no clue they had my credit card even though I mentioned it twice????  The place has potential but with this type of service and lack of detail it will fail. This is my 2nd time in and it's the same bad service.... Too bad."}
{"text":"I've been to Ginger Monkey about 5 times since their soft opening. The wait is hit or miss. Sometimes it's really crowded (avoid coming on days Hamilton High school has football games) and about a 45 minute wait and sometimes it's pretty slow.  I love the location and it has a lot to offer to the south chandler area because there is not a restaurant/bar anything like this place. There are several TVs to watch sports games. There is a nice big relaxing patio. There is an area on the patio that is dog friendly. There is a pool table and other games available. They have a big bar if you want to lounge around and grab some drinks. This place is adult and kid friendly. A few people I know have had negative comments about the wait or how slow the waiters are with bringing food. I only bring this up to warn you not to walk in here hangry.  This place has only been open a couple months and I give big props to the owners Jackson and Doug. They are very involved at the restaurant. Every time I've been there I see them helping and running around. Always very friendly and welcoming too.  As for the food, gotta try their wings! My favorite is the Jack'd flavor. It sounds like it's spicy but it is actually more sweet. It is made with Jack Daniel's. The mac and cheese is good too. It's pretty spicy though.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere are exceptional. The food exceeded my expectations. This is a great place to hang out for and grab a meal with family or friends. This has become a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Menu is by far way too small, but maybe it is due to the relatively new establishment. Don't order a cape codder... their alcohol to mixer ratio is waaaay off...otherwise quite a pleasing meal."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood restaurant / bar.  They have a good beer selection and the standard liquors.  The food was pretty good.  It's a little pricey for the quality, but it's a solid place and I'll go again."}
{"text":"Good food, great patio!   Very nice sports bar feel with a bit of fanciness to the food.  Dog friendly on the patio."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Ginger Monkey at the recommendation of my coworker. It was only the second day that it had been open, so the place was packed. The staff had warned us that it would be 45 minutes before we could order food because the kitchen was backed up. The wait actually went by quickly because the staff kept checking in on us, plus they enjoyed seeing our 6 week old daughter.  Everyone was extremely friendly.  Once the food arrived, it was worth the wait. We had the meatballs as an appetizer and they were delicious. Next, I ordered the Angus beef burger and my wife ordered the pork chop. Both meals did not disappoint, we enjoyed them both although I must say that the pork chop stole the show. When we go back I will definitely be ordering the pork chop.  Lastly, my wife was a huge fan of the ladies room. She said they did a great job trying to make a woman feel special."}
{"text":"This place is ligit...  comfy bar stools great drinks...  I had the turkey avocado panini it was amazing...  I was there after golf with friends it was more than I ever expected. .. Sarah & Lauren are the best bartenders and very cool...  Doug is a great guy....  they played the best 80's music..... I didn't want to leave... it felt I made new friends and found a great place to hangout...."}
{"text":"Manager was incredibly rude and gave us terrible service.  We came in at 10pm when they close at 12 and the server informed us she was the manager. We ordered a few appetizers and she commented that we ordered too much.   No water refills, extremely rude,and as we left she screamed at us that we needed to bring her the bill even though we left cash on the table...."}
{"text":"I love the Monkey! The atmosphere is so diverse. Their huge dining area accomadates for an intimate dining experience, and their bar and patio area are great for watching sports, or just having a good time with friends and family. The food is ALWAYS amazing. The taco special on Tuesday never fails, but they have amazing specials every day of the week. HAPPY HOUR IS WHERE IT'S AT! Service is exceptional; you are always greeted with a happy and helpful staff. They have a doggy-friendly patio! Love that! The Ginger Monkey is an experience I encourage anyone to try."}
{"text":"Overall, the place was good and I've heard good things from other people as well. It's a casual environment in the south Chandler area. We enjoyed sitting on the patio and having a few drinks. The food was good, standard I'd say - nothing too fancy or special. Service was slow given the large crowd we were with but we got our orders correct. Worth another visit for some drinks.   ---- and for the details ---- First of all, sorry for the poor photos! We were out on the patio and it was dark (and I was trying to be sneaky cause we had work friends around, haha)  Came here for a fundraiser recently and loved the place. We were out on the patio enjoying the beautiful Arizona weather.   After we got our food and drink order we really enjoyed it. I really wanted to try the turkey avocado panini and they had a chicken saracha something sandwich that also sounded bomb!! I got the turkey one and it was really good. The salad was also good, but just a normal salad.   Given we were here for a large event, the service was slow as to be expected. Everyone was so nice though and we ended up getting everything and it was all correct within a reasonable time."}
{"text":"There is some good stuff on the menu - my staple is the brussel sprouts. The outside seating area is nice. The service is pretty bad, which at this point we just expect and find a bit humorous. So if you have time to chill, want to watch a game, okay with good food and not so good service ... check it out."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service, beer list and environment! Have tried many things and love them all--so glad Ginger Monkey is open in our neighborhood! The best beer list in town and food that is so much better than typical bar food! Surf and turf nachos, wings, brunch burger were all great!"}
{"text":"What a great experience a Ginger Monkey today! Thanks so much for helping us raise money for our local cheer team- Empire Elite!! The food , beverages and staff were AMAZING. Busy event- and everyone worked to keep us happy. Natalie at the bar gave great service and was very personable.  This was my first visit to Ginger Monkey & I will be back especially for the shrimp and bacon wrap! Thanks Ginger Monkey for supporting our community!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute MUST. Great patio!!! The food is very good. Not crappy bar food.  So far we've had the short ribs, burger, Greek Flatbread and Macaroni...EVERYTHING has been delicious. Service was great.  The restaurant just opened, so I expected a few hiccups, longer wait time on food coming out... but this was NOT THE CASE.  Service was flawless.  This will be our new spot."}
{"text":"It was our first time in.  Breath of fresh air, excellent service.  Acknowledged their short comings posted on yelp and have tried to improve the overall experience.  Give them another chance.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ride my bicycle 26 miles round-trip to come here, because it's the best place to watch Diamondbacks games and drink a little beer. They always have a good beer selection (I drink IPAs when ubering and Amber's when I have to ride the bike home). We always order the sweet chili wings and pesto devilled eggs, and always try to come in for burger Monday or for the fish tacos on Tuesday. The patio is beautiful and Ginger Monkey is a great place to be outside on a giant patio, with comfy lounge furniture and plenty of TVs. We'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"We frequent Ginger Monkey at least twice a month.  It has a great environment for adults and families alike.  Happy Hours and specials are something to look for.  We like to eat outside at the fire bar and relax."}
{"text":"We consistently try this place over and over because we love the atmosphere, and the food is always great. We have never once in the approximately 15 times we have stopped in had even decent service. We're always in the bar section or patio and it's consistently awful. Even with waitresses that recognize us, it will still take over two hours for a lunch. Drinks always run dry, even for waters it will take 10 plus minutes. We can't get extra napkins or anything that may be missing from our order because no one comes to check on us. I just wish this service would try and get better. Maybe add a person to the bar area....all that being said we will be back because we are always rooting for business in the Chandler area and love to support the community!"}
{"text":"I came into work for my sisters 17th birthday and she brought 16 friends plus my family of 5 so 20 people. The hostess Aurora sat the party of 20 right away with no wait! They had reserved signs on the table and everything. Their food all came out together and on time! Very hard to find great service and great food at the same time and ginger monkey has them both! Both managers came over and spoke to our table, which is also rare! Patti and Monique are the managers names and they are awesome they brought out a birthday dessert and sang happy birthday! My sister had an awesome 17th birthday thank you to ginger monkey! I definitely will be returning knowing that they can handle large parties with ease. I would like to thank the managers, owner, and all the staff for taking such great care of us! Glad we still have awesome restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"I have been in this spot lots of times and started out having a great time, but lately it has been tense and not that great. Friday was the final straw. I never enjoy watching someone in charge yell at an employee. I sat at the bar and watched the bartender/manager tell the poor servers that she was refusing to make their drinks because they were stealing her glasses. It was ridiculous. I come to have fun, not be made uncomfortable at someone else's expense. I hope this bar has not run its course because it has potential."}
{"text":"Welcome to chandler Ginger Monkey. Came here for the grand opening. Amazing. Came back on Saturday had a great experience again. The girls behind the bar killed it and made sure the wife and I had an excellent experience. My wife and I loved Gage(Texas) and Lauren (Tennessee) Keep it going Ginger Monkey. My new place place to wine and dine. Thank you for a great new place in chandler to experience Arizonas beautiful weather and have a good time! Excellent food and amazing performance by your staff!!"}
{"text":"We come here all of the time. This was the first bad experience. Bartender obviously didn't want to work today. Food was great as always but service was horrible!"}
{"text":"We went to Ginger monkey for the first time last weekend. The service was amazing, the drinks were fabulous, and the atmosphere was all around a good time. Our bartender, Natalie, was fabulous! She took such good care of us and made sure that we always had a drink in hand. I would highly recommend the sausage stuffed mushrooms, they were fantastic!"}
{"text":"The band tonight was amazing. Keep bringing them back. As always Stan and Tiffany were great! Great food and drinks..must visit in Chandler"}
{"text":"This place has an awesome menu selection. My family and friends always enjoy the food. Southwest burger (OMG...delicous), wraps, Brussels, duckfat fries, wings (homer Simpson status drool) are all amazing. I'm not much of a yelper because I feel some use it to complain about the small stuff... but I'm raving here! Awesome food keeps us coming back and the atmosphere is a bonus!! A must try."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great menu. Nice staff and environment. Not a huge fan of country but it works. Again love love love the food. Duck fat loaded fries, Sesame Seared Ahi Tuna Salad, Greek Grilled Chicken and Hummus wrap. Was too good forget pictures. Well definitely be back maybe a regular thing."}
{"text":"My experience was awesome! I sampled several of the drafts and had this gourmet bacon grilled cheese sandwich that comes with apple slices in it. Try it! Great french fries too. Find Doug, he is the monkey in ginger monkey and a straight up G."}
{"text":"We had dinner there on 10/15/16 at about 515pm. The place was packed inside and out. Friendly staff and  reasonably good service. I had the meatball dinner/appetizer which cost $12. It was OK as far as taste but really was overpriced for the amount you get. It was more expensive than a dinner. I also had the Meatloaf TV Dinner to go. IT was a disappointment even though it was priced right $11. Meatloaf was very below par with little taste and a bit dry. I was hoping they would be special and they arent. New booths and new high top table and chairs and a few more TVs in bar and dining area. The dining and bar is the same config as Whiskey Rose. Whats different is the entrance location comes directly into the dining area which opens it up but at 5pm or so the sunset blinds everyone near the entrance.. Also the patio is open directly into dining area. Two garage doors enable the patio entrance to be opened or closed which is nice. Hopefully they upgrade their food.  I may give it another chance but no meatballs or meatloaf dinner."}
{"text":"They really did a great job with the remodel! Lots of TVs so Sunday Football should be great here. Bathrooms were clean and modern. Yes this location has been tough for the previous 2 restaurant/bars but I really hope Ginger Monkey succeeds. We had the Kung Pao Calamari appetizer, it's spicy and flavorful (better than most Chinese food around here) and just the right amount of heat. We also shared the Spicy Chicken sandwich on the Brioche bun-LOVED it! The BLT salad was delicious too. Service was friendly and attentive. First impressions are very POSITIVE!"}
{"text":"I very rarely negatively update reviews, but we've come in several times since my original 5 star review and have been disappointed. We decided to do takeout tonight, and it was definitely not something worthy of my original rave review. Let's start with the service. The last few times we came in the service was so slow. Appeared to be understaffed, so I let it go. Tonight, there was one guy working his butt off... ONE guy manning the bar, who also had tables on the patio and in dining room. Guy was working so hard and seemed to have no support. Took almost 20 minutes to get one beer. Took an hour to get a to-go order and it was wrong. Felt so bad for him, we just took the food and left. When we got home, we were really disappointed with the food. The burger tasted like the meat had been reheated, and everything was cold.  Really hate to see this place go down hill. Not sure we will be back until reviews show something has changed."}
{"text":"New menu is Awesome. The Chicken Parmesan is Amazing. Great service, fun atmosphere and live music. Add this one to your \"must stop in and enjoy myself\" list."}
{"text":"Service was sub par at best. They over charged us and then gave us attitude when we tried to contest the check."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been wanting to try this place out for a while now so we went last evening on a Friday night.  It was 12:40am and the band was still playing.  We sat at a booth in the bar for a good 10 min and no one acknowledged us so we decided to sit at the bar.  The manager and bar tender saw us but again did not acknowledge us.  We finally asked them if we could get service and they proceeded to say they were no longer serving for the night.  Even though we were told they were open until 2am.  The manager was extremely rude and made us feel unwelcome.  I am very disappointed and will not give this place my business."}
{"text":"I drove by this place for two weeks admiring how pretty it looks, then noticed all the TVs it has so I could sell the boyfriend in going there. Honestly, I don't know how everyone didn't give it five stars. The staff are amazing... Everyone from the hosts to the bussers to the managers and owners are on point with service. The thoughtfulness that they put into the business is evident in everything from the design of the building to the selection of food and drink. Special shout out to Logan and Nate for taking exceptional care of us. This place is our new home.   You will not find friendlier bartenders or more comfy seats at another bar."}
{"text":"As you can see I've Given THE GINGER MONKEY 5 stars and I'll tell you why . My daughter and I were waiting to go to an appointment and decided to have a glass of wine and we decided to try this restaurant as we've heard fro friends that it was good . Walking in we see this open air concept with a beautiful patio area beyond that .We sat at the bar on these cushy bar stools ( loved them ) and the bartender came over and greeted us so friendly and warmly as if we were old friends !! Kudos to that cause that doesn't happen every day !! Ordered our glass of wine and were still chatting with Doug so we went ahead and ordered lunch , sandwiches that he recommended which were delicious !! To top all this deliciousness He brought us a piece of fabulous cheesecake !!  Turns out Doug is one of the owners !! WELL DONE DOUG ! Do yourself a favor and check this place out ! You'll be glad you did !"}
{"text":"Some of the negative reviews are for pretty bogus reasons like not having hefeweizen and not being open for lunch. I don't get it. Waiting for a long time can be frustrating but trust me, restaurants don't do that on purpose - it hurts them more than you!  I went to the opening day of Ginger Monkey on Friday, 10/7 and had a great time. It was packed, that's for sure, but I put our name in and went to the bar for a drink. The bartenders were extremely friendly and attentive and after awhile, we were able to grab some seats at the bar (which are incredibly comfortable!!!) and ordered the nachos. Yes, they took awhile to come out but just imagine opening at 3pm for the first time and being non-stop slammed in the kitchen for the entire night...I'm sympathetic to that. The nachos eventually came out and were absolutely phenomenal. We stayed for hours having drinks with friends, enjoyed the fire outside, played lots of darts and had an overall great time. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Courteous crew, great service, and fantastic food. It was our first visit and the whole family enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"We went around 2pm on a Saturday for a late lunch and a few beers. When we sat down our waitress rudely tells us the kitchen is only making appetizers until 3. Okay no problem we will order an app and some beers and order after 3. The rude waitress then comes back to the table and said the kitchen just told her they only have nachos and deviled eggs available. WTH!? So not only was the service rude but we never were able to eat anything. We left and went to Garcias. At least give us a free app coupon or treat us nicely, apologize and show some customer service skills. I was excited to try something new but I don't think I will even give it a second chance with how rude the staff was."}
{"text":"Ginger Monkey Tavern was just ok. The staff was nice and polite, but overall it seemed like an off night. We were a party of 4 adults, and one child.   The staff is not really versed on the menu or beverage ingredients. That makes it difficult with allergy issues.   Appetizers: We ordered wings (undercooked, but seasoned nicely), duck fat fries - cheese sauce was grainy like it sat too long and starting to separate) and the Brussel sprouts. The food came out lukewarm.  We were told wings are baked, then fried. They should have been cooked through and we were disappointed.   Entrees: The chicken carbonara was ok. Plates were super hot from sitting under a light, but the pasta was not hot and the sauce was lukewarm. We ordered a chopped salad - not my definition of a chopped salad. Lettuce cut into huge pieces, and you couldn't find the olives, etc.  I asked for croutons but was told they didn't have any. When I mentioned there were croutons for the Caesar salad, she seemed stumped and surprised, but I did get some croutons. The croutons are not home made. The strawberry salad had one berry. The burger was undercooked.  We ordered sliders, but they were out of buns.  Our last entree was short ribs. Either the order wasn't placed, or there was a kitchen mishap. Unfortunately everyone was finished with their meal by the time this  entree was served. This wasn't a seasoned short rib, but a chunk of pot roast. On the other hand, the accompanying rice was cooked perfectly.    Dessert: we ordered an apple crisp and 3 more desserts. The apple crisp was meh. And the ice cream - No flavor, and definitely not vanilla bean as advertised. We also ordered a hot tea and never got any. We had wanted decaf, but they were out. Management did not come by to apologize or share what went wrong.   It was sadly an expensive dinner and we were very underwhelmed by the kitchen. Our server was really delightful, and could have used more help.  I don't know if we will attempt another visit."}
{"text":"Comfortable Atmosphere,Friendly Service with a smile The Food was Delicious and the fellas that own this place treat you like Family. I highly recommend this place to anyone . Ginger Monkey Spot On Fantastic!!! Thank You"}
{"text":"First visit to Ginger Monkey. After hearing from several people what a great place this is, finally was able to try it out. Happy we did. Enjoyed appetizers, surf n turf nachos, very good, chips n salsa and drinks. Oh my the salsa is delish! Our server Jason Caito did a fantastic job not only serving but entertaining us. The owner is a delight too. Came by the table and introduced herself(damn, forgot her name). Recommended and the house covered a Monkey Punch to replace a different drink that wasn't quite making our taste buds happy. Great recommendation. Came back later in the evening and had a great time listening and joining in with the band. Brody, tending bar was quick at keeping our drinks full. Definitely will be back to enjoy the atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"So this is a 2 time review! My son and I stopped in here Thursday night and had some hot wings and a beer. We sat outside (it was a cool night) so we enjoyed the fire pit and low key vibe. We had great service from Cassidy. She was knowledgeable about the menu and was so sweet. So tonight when my husband wanted to grab a quick bite I suggested we go back. Tonight we are in the restaurants and had chips and salsa and wings and a burger. We were served by Jayson. He was awesome too! For the food this place is the real deal! It's a hidden gem in chandler! The chips were fresh and crisp and the salsa was delicious! For wings we did a dozen they are meaty, and crisp the Sauce options we went with were kung Pao and chipotle and they were so tasty! Dare I say the BEST wings  I've ever had! My husband did a classic burger. He really enjoyed it too! Do your self a favor and stop in this awesome place oh and check out the bathrooms too! Thanks GM for awesome food and service we WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Nice place. But the food needs some work. Had ahi tuna salad and my husband had the chicken parm. Both were tasteless and over priced. Tuna was over cooked and the chicken pa was bland."}
{"text":"This place is a breath of fresh air after all of the previous failures that have plagued this building! Ginger Monkey sounds strange indeed and serves American fare, which seems odd too. Our party of 15 was seated promptly on a Friday night with no reservation. They have a decent beer list with local brews. I ordered the meatloaf tray since it sounded fun and different. It came with meatloaf, mashed potatoes, gravy, a mocha brownie, and creamed corn on a TV dinner tray. Points for not being boring! The food was pretty good too, although I wasn't a fan of the brownie. The meatloaf was moist with a drixzle of ketchup. The corn was creamy, as it should be, abd the potatoes were great with the gravy. Great comfort food! Every one else appeared to enjoy their food as well.   Service was good too. You have to check out the bathrooms too! I've never been on a heated seat toilet before. Lol. Definitely a great addition to Chandler, Ginger Monkey!"}
{"text":"Bunch of buttheads here.  Was thrilled to find a Broncos bar but devastated with the attitudes.  House liquor is turpentine and never got offered a menu so I can't review the food.  I think the bartender was fired from the bar next door.  I remember him.  Strange vibe in the place....sort of a dive bar feel and the other customers were not friendly or fun.  3rd try here, we're done."}
{"text":"So this place is pretty close to our house so the lover and I wanted to check it out.   I'm wondering why they don't have a website? That, or I just couldn't find one. I wanted some red wine, because they didn't really have a cocktail menu. Our server wasn't very knowledgeable when it came to wine. However, the one I got was actually pretty good. So I saw the TV dinner on the menu, and was very eager to try it. I haven't had meatloaf in years and it was actually pretty darn good. It also comes with mashed potatoes, gravy and creamed corn. Everything was delicious. The brownie wasn't that great, it was pretty dry, however everything else was good.   It's a very big portion so I was only able to finish half of it. It's a pretty good size restaurant and pretty outdoor patio. They also have a pool table in the back. I believe they also have happy hour and a dog friendly patio. So I'll definitely be back for that!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Dessert was delicious and our waitress, Hannah was awesome! We celebrated my daughters 19th birthday and everyone had a great time!"}
{"text":"Our first time here was last night to support our friends band. We sat at the bar and the service was absolutely horrible. Had to flag down the girls to serve us. Beer list isn't up to date - took my husband 3 times to get a beer they still had. We had one drink and left. There is a terrible smell inside the bar area. Bartenders were not friendly or helpful at all. The only redeeming quality of this bar is the beautiful patio with gas fire pits to sit around. 100% do not recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I do eat out, a lot Ginger Monkey the new guy on the block...The hostess seated me right away the staff took my order I had a mouth watering Spicy Chicken sandwich with fries and Ice Cold Beer...I was done.. it was off the hook good...I will be back...Cheer's Bluesman Mike"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  Love the name, great seating, and a good menu.  However, I can say I have NEVER been treated so rudely by waitstaff before.  Raul, was nasty, condescending and generally unhelpful. When asked about a menu item he harshly told me that children like it so I would too.  I could never get any info about what was in the dish.  I wish I could say he was proficient at his job but, NOPE.  He didn't even bring out our entire order and charged us full price for a drink and happy hour prices for an appetizer, even though they were both supposed to be happy hour priced. The nicest thing I can say is that the beer was cold however, so was the attitude.  Do yourself a favor and skip this place."}
{"text":"Food was extremely under-whelming considering the price. Items on the menu were not available and a $10 half-size chicken spinach salad was ridiculously small. Service was just okay. Burgers and fries were mediocre. First and definitely last time I will be eating here with my family. Not a fan and do not recommend. Go spend $70 for a family of four somewhere else for better quality food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I want to love it so much. Okay:  1st Time table had 2 dead flies on it. 1 ant. I ordered the Surf and Turf Nachos, And while shrimp and briskett sound DIVINE on some nachos...this just lacked a little foot in it - Ya know like culinary deliciousness. The chips are way to thin, brisket really Is NOT juicy and meaty and fantastic, The shrimp is absolutely forgettable, (i've had better shrimp and el pollo loco). But the Nachos were not Horrible, they just didn't taste as fantastic and epic as they sounded on the menu. General Tso Chicken wings on the other hand were BOMB, yummy all the way through and through, they serve it with ranch that seems home made and absolutely delicious.    2nd Time, OILY sweaty fingerprints all over the wine glasses. Waitress took the glasses back very graciously and said she'd bring new ones over...She brought them back and said she polished them herself. Um no. They were still with last girls lip print on them and foggy swipes from whatever she was using to polish them everywhere. I just left it alone. I just didn't drink my wine at that point.   Bathroom toilets are cool with a bidet. They have live music and the environment is cool.  When the weather is better they have open patio. The bar looks cool. Big long booth tables for bigger parties to all sit together.  Try it maybe your experience is different."}
{"text":"A beautiful bar / restaurant with a comfortable airy vibe. Visit the patio fireplaces and be sure to ask for Candace as your server. She's a ROCKSTAR! (but they all rock) ENJOY! We did. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by to try this place out.  I don't get to this part of Chandler very often and I didn't realize the previous restaurant had gone out of business. Stop by here around 4 PM. The place was dead, I mean we were like the only people there. Our waitress was great she was all over our drinks but the food took forever. The appetizers we had were the meatballs at six dollars for happy hour normally $12 otherwise. No way in hell will I pay $12 for those again. They were terrible, super dry and the texture felt like they been sitting around for 24 hours. I ordered the spicy fried chicken sandwich or something and it was absolutely gross. It tasted and felt like it was undercooked. We will definitely not be going back to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Nice sports bar with lots of open air seating.  Tvs everywhere and good selection of craft beers.  Good service, so what's the problem?  Well pretty pricey and the food is mediocre.  I mean seriously, that sums it up.  I am not saying don't try it.  Might be hood for you.  Just a bit much for me."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying they have a bidet, what place do you know has one?! Super clean bathrooms. The place is great, open area, outside patio for games. The service is beyond great. I had Brussels and the drunken shrimp, both were fantastic. My cousin had the breakfast burrito which was huge and stated it was great. I thoroughly enjoyed this place and will return!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! Jackson is very cool and since we are from Denver, this is the place to be..... the food is great, in fact we brought my inlaws here from Denver to celebrate their anniversary. Now however Monday is the bomb since they brought on Karaoke.  You will find us here on Mondays for sure...... Can't say enough about G.M. Except, \"See ya there\""}
{"text":"Yup. Absolutely awesome. Food is great. Service was impeccable. Order the brussel sprouts with thick cut bacon appetizer.  Aaaaaaaamazing."}
{"text":"Really disappointed as far as I came in with expectations and none were met. I was really excited looking at the pictures online. 1. It's only a brunch menu until 3... I wanted a good lunch, not brunch. 2. Desserts... I was so pumped for the cheesecake... Nope they apparently don't sell it anymore... Pictures looked freaking amazing. 3. Wine lists are not up to date. 4. Get potato vodka...  The service I received was good and the food I got was good. Sweet Bbq chili wings were really good. Just overall disappointed I couldn't get 3 of the items I came in for"}
{"text":"Bartender was awesome, despite the fact that she was solo and had a full bar and bar tables and the only bartender on... meanwhile three managers sat at a bar table and did NOTHING to support her, despite seeing the situation. A+ for bar staff | F complete failure on the part of management"}
