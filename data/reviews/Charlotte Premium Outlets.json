{"text":"Since this outlet came to the area I shop no where else! love the store selection and the walking areas are very well kept, the have fire places in the sitting areas when it chilly out. I know it's in expansion so I am hoping to get a larger variety of places to eat but there is so much construction going on that I am sure thats in the near future. It gets really full for the holiday weekends so do your shopping during the weekdays"}
{"text":"I think that the Outlets are a nice place to go to get some stuff cheaper. But as that is true it is very hot or miss. Some of my faves are Old Navy, Vera Bradley, Francesca's, and way more. Sometimes I wish they had a better food selection at the Outlets like the ones in South Park or Carolina Place. I also think the Starbucks should be a tad bigger. I would recommend going there but don't go looking for something specific!! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Everything is so clean.  I'm not usually a fan of open air shopping,but there's a quite a bit of covering for inclement weather days.  Lots of shops my family and I like.  Friendly customer service at pretty much all the stores.  Parking can be a pain at times, but I don't generally like shopping with the crowds so no biggie.   The only thing I don't like is the popcorn stand.  It really smells awful.  But hey!  There's a Starbucks too :)"}
{"text":"Up date. Charlie's philly steaks has now opened. Food looked good. Priced better than Ho Chi Min. The fries can be dressed in all kinds of stuff."}
{"text":"nice outlet stores with all the favorites like michael kors, coach, saks fifth, haggar, children's place and more!!!!"}
{"text":"These outlets have been open for over a year now and the center is well layed out and has a nice variety of shops to choose from. The food court could use a lot more variety. With only 4 options to choose from, it's not a big draw."}
{"text":"I have been 5 outlets in US. This is the first one I companied my husband came here. I surprised him, stuffs here are cheaper and good quality. He also recommend outlets to family."}
{"text":"Really not a bad set up, I think it's a Simone operation as many of the premium malls in Orlando. Did score some deals but you have to go straight back to clearance.   Got a beautiful dark navy t-shirt at Brooks Brothers for 16 bucks and some Clarks sandles for 19. I actually prefer this layout because it forces you to walk, lots and lots. Can't wait to get some more food vendors but other than that it was fine for the very occasional visit. Off Broadway is awesome if you know where to look. The real designer stuff is near the registers, saw Prada, Escada, Valentino (not Red, but the real Valentino) etc. They were marked 60% off lowest ticket price. Some pretty silk Escada pants originally 895, marked 300 then 60% off that. Ugh, none in my size but a fun hunt."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  So much fun. Outside shopping & great deals!!!   Banana Republic, Adidas, Express, Rebok, and many more awesome stores!    They have a small food court that I'm not a huge fan of. The pizza was edible but none descript. I'd try one of the food trucks instead.  They also have a Starbucks which people were lined up for.    Just a little warning below:  Stay away from Aunti Annie's pretzel dogs though. The first one I had was doughy & unfortunately didn't get any better with an unidentified object in the other."}
{"text":"You really can find deals at this outlet mall if 1) you go at the end of the season.  In mid-August all of the stores deeply discounted summer shorts.  No matter the brand, most shirts were priced $15 or under!  2) You watch for promotional sales. Last weekend everything at Kate Spade was 70% off! 3) You go during the middle of the week when there are less customers."}
{"text":"Brand new, clean, every shop was staffed with compitent engaging employees.  Defiantly worth a stop."}
{"text":"Very nice outside mall. I come here quite often to basically walk around and sometimes shop. I held off on writing a review simply to see if the staff of this mall would keep it nice. And, to my surprise, its always clean no matter when I come!  Keep it up. Great spot to come and relax or shop"}
{"text":"Awesome outlet! There are a lot of high-end shops here. If you are looking for something specific like a Parka, there are several stores that carry the item. One thing I don't understand is why there are two sunglass huts right next to each other."}
{"text":"Finally!!! An outlet mall on the other side of town! I'm definitely happy to see it!   It was the opening weekend so of course there were plenty of sales, discounts and happy associates ready to offer this assistance. I enjoyed waking through and thought that the store layout was pretty cool! They have a lot of great stores including Nine West, Banana Republic, Michael Kors, Ann Taylor, Nike and Old Navy just to name a few!   I think that for many people this could turn into their \"go-to\" one stop shop! I wish they had a few more food options but they are still building so I'm sure that coming in the not so distant future! And parking is a little crazy but what else would you expect from an outlet mall?!  Yep. I'm a fan. I'm already looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Nice place to take the kids. Enjoyed taking the baby in the stroller around to the different places. It's perfect for a mini trip with the family as there is something for all ages. From rack room shoes to carters to michael kore......perfect is a beast but park near old navy and you typically can get in and out just depends where you actually need to go."}
{"text":"These were pretty good outlets.  They seemed very new and very well taken care of.  They had all the usual outlet stores and we found a couple good deals here and there.  The Lindt Chocolate store and Starbucks definitely came in handy.  We'll be back if we ever go to Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Great place, a lot of stores to pick from. Brand new, so everything is still nice. Clientele is a little sketchy at times. I think the food court only has two Chinese places and an O'Charley;s ... so don't plan on eating while you're here.  We went at 630 pm on a Saturday and it was the slowest we've ever seen ... everyone must have left to go to dinner ... PERFECT TIME TO COME!"}
{"text":"Great Outlet stores. Love the open design with seating in the middle. Easy to get between sections. They are adding more food options which is nice. The Starbucks is always very busy.  Parking can be a challenge, and I'm looking forward to more food options. Other than that it is a great Outlet Store and we love shopping there."}
{"text":"Black Friday shopping has been very successful! Love these outlets. Wide variety of stores. Would be 5 stars if restaurants were around. They do have a food court though!"}
{"text":"This outlet is clean and upscale customer service. Lots of store to shop from. Better than all the mall around me. I love coming here. Don't miss out, go check it out."}
{"text":"It's not bad here.  I wish there were some more shops, but I do like there is a Under Armour outlet here!"}
{"text":"Very pleased with this outlet! Lots of awesome stores (my faves: Kate Spade, Puma, Coach, Old Navy, Fossil, Le Creuset, & Lucky) & plenty of parking. Also, easy in & out off 485. Personally, I like this place much better than Concord Mills. The layout is nice & open, so you don't feel so crowded with other shoppers. As another reviewer mentioned, food options aren't plentiful, but they are building up around the mall."}
{"text":"I have to put this review here even though it's for food because there wasn't any way to pull up the 'restaurant'.. it simply wasn't listed. I was there yesterday at 5:30pm. Dinner time. And made the mistake of eating at the Italian place in the food court. I don't even remember the full name of it. I got a slice of cheese pizza, some garlic knots, and a cucumber/tomato/onion salad.  Terrible. Absolutely terrible. I have never had such flavorless food EVER. The pizza was undercooked and almost thin enough to see through. The garlic knots were unevenly sized, undercooked, flavorless and missing a key ingredient - GARLIC. The marinara was so runny that it didn't even stick to the bread. The salad looked like it had been there all day and was still the better tasting item. All of that came to almost $11, which I would normally say wasn't bad, but for what I made the mistake of eating it was overpriced. I expected much better out of that caliber of shopping center. I will never eat there again.   Also the shopping center needs a better variety and options for eating."}
{"text":"Great place. Had some good sales. Pretty good variety of stores. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is ok. I mean I've never had an issues coming here, except finding a parking space can be a tad bit difficult when it's really busy. Not a huge fan of the walking paths and how difficult it can sometimes be to cross to get into the parking lot. Stores are decent, and I appreciate the fact that it has shaded areas, which are especially beneficial on hot days."}
{"text":"This outlet is definitely needed on this side of town but they may have rushed the opening.  Who opens an outlet with food trucka. I'll try back when the real food stores open but the location looks vibrate. There are a lot of stores to shop at but not sure there are reallly bargains."}
{"text":"Charlotte Premium Outlet is a decent stop for you shopping indulgence and credit card swiping. This is an outdoor outlet which is good and bad depending on the weather and where the smokers smoke. Uggh. I really don't like the layout of the outlet and I haven't been able to find a directory that tells you where to go and I've been here many times. Maybe I'm so confused by the layout and having to find a decent parking spot. Also CPO needs to have better signage from the interstate to their property and exit signs as well.  I personally am not a fan of this location but their are some stores here that keep me coming back such as Cole Haan, Brooks Brothers and a couple more. If you live in the area then you can't do worse but otherwise take yourself to Concord Mills for a better selection and the indoor environment so you don't have to worry about smokers smoking in your face."}
{"text":"Fun outlet mall. Curious location. I guess that area is growing just like the rest of Charlotte.  Great for a layover as it is near the airport. Needs better restaurants and a Nautica store. Otherwise a neat day trip."}
{"text":"Kate Spade, Michael Kors, and Under Armour are my favs here. There are plenty of of others but these are my go to stores. Nike is disappointing because they do not really have any markdowns, on anything! Express is ok...Banana Republic doesn't have much (at least not when I've been there). But if you need to do some shopping go check it out, there are some good deals there!"}
{"text":"So I am a fan of this place first of all it's an outdoor mall, which may annoy some people but I prefer it as I get claustrophobic in places where huge crowds gather. For example Concord Mills is a place I wouldn't be caught dead in because just walking in the door sends me into a panic. Here at Charlotte Premium Outlets there is plenty of space for people to mill around and sit and not be constantly in someone's personal space even on a sunny Saturday. Another reason I love this mall is it has a lot of the stores that I like to frequent and it has most of the upscale places that I'm interested in checking out. The third and biggest reason I love this place is that they are always and I mean always running some kind of special in the stores. Yes okay I realize that it's an Outlet mall, but let's face it we've all been to the outlets and thought wow this is NOT a deal!! Here I feel like I can find things at a discounted rate (plus on sale) and that makes me a very happy shopper! I still haven't fully explored this place  and it is laid out a bit like a maze, so I agree you can easily get lost. Seriously though just count it as your cardio for the day... win win on so many levels!! Best thing is I live near here and if you come after work or at lunch etc. it's not crowded and you can have an amazing shopping experience!!   The negatives of this place though are that there are absolutely way too many compact parking spots. Seriously there have been many occasions where we've come back out to the car and couldn't get in because someone parked in a Compact spot and they shouldn't have. The second negative is that there is zero food in or near the mall. Restaurants need to get on the ball as they'd make a killing if they opened up around here. So don't go hungry and bring snacks if you plan on marathon shopping!!"}
{"text":"Parking! Parking! Parking! Extremely tight parking and crowded with an unusual parking lot design. Traffic does not flow smoothly on a busy day. As far as stores it has all of the typical favorites Under Armour, Nike, etc. We found some really good deals. A food truck was parked out front which was very much needed since the food court leaves a lot to be desired which seems to be a common theme at these outlets that I have visited in other areas. We ate at the pizza place in the food court which was not that good! SPAGHETTI was tasteless and the pizza slice was ok. Starbucks is there but is not located in the food court but the service was good there."}
{"text":"I hauled my mother along with me to visit the outlets, arriving at 10 am on a Friday (CMS schools were out, and it was Halloween - I thought this was going to be poor planning on my part, but it turned out okay).    With the early arrival time during the work-week, I easily found a parking spot at the end of a row near Old Navy.  Be warned - the parking lot was designed by Helen Keller and there are WAY too many C (compact) parking spots.  Some of the compact cars we saw when leaving were a Navigator, a Sequoia, an Expedition and several full size sedans.  Stop with the damn compact parking.  (I know, I know... I work for an arch firm, parking spot quotas and whatnot, but STAHHHHP).  Food Court is bleh.  And there is nothing really close to the outlets to eat.  Eat before or after, or know that you will need to get a cookie at the cookie joint and a coffee from Starbucks to snack on.  The Starbucks is not it's own store, it's more of an overgrown coffee stand/building in the middle of the walkway.  You're going to be standing in line outside and you have to keep moving.  As a chubby gal, I was happy to see the Old Navy.  Torrid (the big and tall whore store) is also located here, but everything was black and goth'y (I am fat, but I still like to wear colors).  They had great purse deals at the Kate Spade and Coach, though the folks at the Coach were stalking and I can't stand that.  Greet me when I come in and then leave me alone.  Outer wear was well priced at Eddie Bauer, as was the clearance section.  Yankee Candle had the large jars 4 for $44 (be aware that this is truly the outlet for YC - you typically won't find the same scents that they have in the stores/online, though some were stocked).  I was a little disappointed that the GH Bass store had mostly boots, but 'tis the season.  Like Bruce K. said, if you have ever been to a Simon/Premium Outlet, you know what to expect.  This is very similar to the outlets that I have visited in Charleston in design and retailers.  A nice addition to the Charlotte area, and I will definitely return (at 10 am on Sundays or after the first of the year - I wouldn't come here during the holidays unless forced at gunpoint - it's going to be a shitshow)."}
{"text":"So close to home it's hard not to shop here. Pretty decent shopping. I like the open air concept it just sucks when it's raining. Wish there was some type of awning over the walkways. Looking forward to another option in the food court. Only store that is missing is Polo."}
{"text":"It's an outlet mall, but wow is it poorly designed.  An outdoor floor plan and parking lot both with little shade in heart of the Carolinas where it's in the 90s for almost half of the year?  The parking is very limited; there just are not enough spaces (2000 for 100 stores?).  Wait until the holidays because this is going to be mess.  There are only two restaurants in the \"food court\" now open. That does not count the Chk-fil-a selling $5 tiny chicken sandwiches and 12 ounce Cokes for $2 when 20 ounces of the latter can be found cheaper in the machine or food court restaurants.  You are a table with one employee; you have no overhead so you are ripping people off.  Some of the stores have real outlet deals; others not.  I found a pair of jeans in my size (36x36) which is very difficult to find at Eddie Bauer for $23.  That was a pretty good deal.  Many of the other stores seem to be selling stuff at regular retail prices.  I will say some of the Labor Day sales were good; others not so much - $25 off of $250 at Tommy Hilfiger?  Pass.  It's nice to have in the area but I don;t think I will return regularly."}
{"text":"Visiting here from Chicago. Staying at a hotel nearby. Family member suggested I visit this mall. It's outdoor. Really nice and clean. I went on a Tuesday around 1:00. Previous reviews say it's a nightmare. I guess the key is too stay away during busy times. Parking wasn't bad for me, and it wasn't too crowded. This mall is located Located in a very nice area. They have all the typical outlet stores like Nike, Puma, Steve Madden, Gap, Old Navy, Carters. Plus more that I don't think you typically see at outlets like Pacsun and Express.  Feel like the stores that you don't normally see in an outlet mall that are here are over priced or regular priced. Basically the same prices you would see in a normal mall. That kind of stinked, but with that being said I think it's nice still. I'm normally not a fan of outlet malls, but I would visit this outlet mall again."}
{"text":"Charlotte Premium Outlets really delivers on the outlet shopping part. It is an outdoor setup similar to the other Premium Outlet locations. The store selection is good and the layout was fine. My biggest problem was the parking lot. It was a nightmare to navigate and there were a ton of pissed off shoppers trying to get in and out."}
{"text":"Charlotte Premium Outlets located just off of 485 is super-easy to get to with plenty of parking.  There's a large number of outlets that aren't available anywhere else near Charlotte - so, that's a plus.   I didn't feel like the deals were amazing - but, for the type of store you are shopping, I suppose you could feel like you're getting a deal.  The walkways between stores are outside - so, remember to bring sunglasses/coat/umbrella depending on the weather.    There are only 3 restaurants in the food court and 3 fast food options on the exit.  Lesson learned - eat before you go.  There's no parking behind the mall - don't bother driving behind, it's just staff parking and no public entrances.  Check out the map before you start browsing - the layout is not intuitive."}
{"text":"If there was some sort of Swiss standard of an outlet mall, like some sort of platonic concept of an outlet mall, this would be it.  It just shoots a bit low for my taste.  The Charlotte Premium Outlets is a new outlet mall, meaning it has a lot going for it - clean amenities, a convenient location, newer stores, etc.  It's not huge (and nowhere near the size of, for example, Arundel Mills), but it's reasonably sized for the area and roughly the size of the Gaffney Premium Outlets.    The stores here leave a bit to be desired.  There's J.Crew, Brooks, and a few shoe retailers like Johnston and Murphy and Clarks, but all carry cheaper versions of their brands that, in sum, are far from exciting and were often visibly inferior.  Some locations (Eddie Bauer) were completely useless and embarrassing, whereas others (Old Navy Outlet) just seemed to be needless.  While this isn't the Charlotte Premium Outlets' problem per se, it did lend to a feeling that I wasn't getting a true deal - rather, there was just a bunch of smoke and mirrors.  Other outlet malls - Gaffney being an example - somehow never lent that impression.  All the same, this is convenient and may be worth a look, depending on your budget and needs."}
{"text":"You can find some great deals here if you haven't looked. Depending on the store and the time you come the stores have a lot of sales. However, depending on what you're looking for, there are better places around Charlotte to get deals. But for specialty stores this place will probably have what you're looking for.   They have a food court here, but it's still under construction? I mean, I have seen it when it's been opened and I've been in there just to use the restroom. However, there are options and supposedly more restaurants will be filling the space.   Overall, definitely a fan and there is definitely deals here. Check the stores and fulfill your (window) shopping craving heart out!"}
{"text":"Overall, the outlets have several nice stores to shop at - a great variety. There is not that many restaurant to grab a bite (I believe 3 inside the \"market\"), but I didn't mind because I was not eating here.  Everything seemed to be clean and no debris; that I saw. This is a great second choice if concord is a bit too far but I personally like concord better than this outlet mall."}
{"text":"For food, this place is a 1 star. Definitely don't stay here all day or be hungry! Luckily there are some new places going in, nearby, but as far as food at the outlet mall, it is a joke! I don't venture into too many of the stores, to be honest, but the ones that I do, I love! It's laid out nicely, as well, and it's nice to walk around. I'm a fan of this spot! Definitely not worn down or out, like some outlet malls eventually become (it is brand new, and it seems that there is a lot of nice things going in nearby, as well, to help keep it nice!)"}
{"text":"Come early, covers up fast on weekends.  Just open a few weeks -- with basically none of the food court open, with the exception of a couple Asian fronts -- this is a well-conceived \"outlet\" mall with a couple actual outlet bargain bins. The Saks Fifth Avenue OFF 5TH is certainly a bargain hunters spot, as is the Brooks Brothers, if you sure of what you are looking for and at what price.   Max digging is somewhat weather dependent as only about two-thirds of this open-air mall is covered completely from rain, etc. But once it and the adjacent parcels are fully built-out, could be quite the draw."}
{"text":"Stores are great - but seriously, who was the architect that thought it would be a good idea to line the entire outside perimeter with spots for compact cars?  Number one, this is the south - there are more trucks here than anywhere else. Number two, this is an outlet Center. I come with my big car so I can buy lots of things and fit them in the car. so many people are trying to park their oversized cars and trucks in those spots - so if you don't have a compact car - get there early."}
{"text":"I always love this outlet mall. The parking can be a little tight sometimes, especially on the weekends. Other than that it's great with a wide range of stores to choose from."}
{"text":"Really liked this outlet. It had great deals in some stores, not in others. Exactly what you would expect from outlets.  The food options were very limited so I was a little disappointed. Don't get too hungry here, it might not work out. Also, they did not have a Ralph Lauren store which upsets me personally, i love catching good deals on their sweaters when possible.   Overall, definitely worth the visit. Coach store always has something good!"}
{"text":"I hate shopping. So when I have to, it's nice to have it all in one place. However, I didn't see any deals that were better than a TJ Maxx or Marshals. The Banana Republic didn't seem to carry anything in an Xl or at least non Large-slim. Jos A. Banks was picked clean and barely had anything on the shelves. Went in a few other places. Wasted my time. At least when I end up in a normal mall, I haven't driven as out of the way."}
{"text":"Parking here sucks. The only reason we ever get pulled here is because Kate Spade Spams my wifes email box all year long. So anytime we are driving by here , they are just happening to have some sort of 50% sale or Buy One Over Priced Bag Get One Half Over Priced. Either way, the Parking here really sucks. If you ave an SUV you will have to find a park in the back or get scratches on your front.   TIP: Check in here on YELP and get a $5 Spend Voucher for anywhere at the outlet."}
{"text":"This outlet actually has a lot of stores that I typically don't see at an outlet. Things like Express, Jos A Banks, Cole Haan and others. The deals were really just ok. Nothing really spectacular but at least the tax rate here is cheaper versus back home in Los Angeles. I was extremely disappointed in the dining options as there was only 2 available restaurants and both were Asian which I thought was kind of strange. You can probably finish going to all of the stores really quickly."}
{"text":"Nice open-air concept. Shopped at a few places. The first place was the Fragrance Outlet. I love perfume, but I went into fragrance overload while in the store. Wilson Leather had great deals on leather purses and jackets. I got a leather tote for 39.99 (regularly priced 140.00). The Nike outlet is priced just below mall and online prices. My son got a pair of Kevin Durant sneakers for 69.99. We seen the same pair at Northlake Foot Locker for 79.99. The great part about shopping at the Nike Outlet was that the men sizes go all the way to size 14! The food court (Market Hall) was a little on the small size with a few choices. But all in all, it was a decent experience."}
{"text":"love Mac lipstick products so I happened to come across the store and walk in. The lady who was at the counter didn't seem to be enjoying herself. She gave me an blunt greeting. I asked to try on a color she said do you want me to clean it? Uh yeah so I can try it on. And than I saw another color I liked and she came back with the 1st color She gave me a wtf look... rude customer service if u aren't enjoying your job give it to me.I love being an sales person and selling pretty lipsticks lol"}
{"text":"Very nice outlet mall area with lots of options. They have most of the staples including Nike, Adidas, Fossil, Kate Spade, etc. There are some shaded areas, but be weary of visiting on extremely hot days or be prepared to need a shower after. There a maps all over to help find the store you are looking for. There aren't, however, very many food options here. They could definitely use a few more. You will definitely find some good deals on many different types of items all in the same place."}
{"text":"I finally got around to checking out Charlotte Premium Outlets and I'm a fan! I like how it's an outdoor mall and roomier than your standard mall...much nicer concept than Concord Mills. I went on a Friday afternoon, so I'm sure it's normally a lot more crowded - but at this time I was able to find parking and get in and out pretty quickly. Shoppers need to educate themselves on the meaning of \"Compact Parking\" though - I wish I'd taken a picture of all the GIANT pickups squeezed into the compact spots.   The stores range from high-end like Kate Spade, Michael Kors, Saks to more affordable stores like J Crew Factory, Old Navy, Gap, etc. so there's something for everyone. There's also a small food court area with plenty of seating and clean restrooms.    All in all (as far as outlet malls go), I'm a fan. When the need strikes, I'll head here instead of NC's #1 visitor attraction."}
{"text":"Visiting from Cincinnati, stopped for quick shop and it was just that \"quick\" I believe the grounds are very new, selection was fair but found to be redundant compared to other outlets. If your looking for good shopping I would steer away"}
{"text":"Nice place to go if you are looking to save some money on select name brands."}
{"text":"I am mainly going to use this review to shoutout the J Crew Outlet, as well as Brooks Brothers! These places have insane savings deals! The outlets as a whole have top name brand clothing retailers at discount, outlet prices. I can speak with certainty in saying there is no way shop here and pay retail prices; so unless that is just your thing, the outlets are for you.  J Crew had a new lineup of winter sweaters, cardigans, and flannel shirts up to 60% off. I took advantage of all 3! The flannel shirts were $20/each and the sweaters (retail $70) ended up being around $30. All winter accessories were 60% off as well. I pride myself in collecting an assortment of unique socks; a few were added to my wardrobe today. I have always had great help from the sales associates at this store, and always great customer service.   Being in the hunt for a good suit landed me at Brooks Brothers. I tend to shy away from this store but today changed my perspective entirely. Help, greeted me from the moment I entered the store until I exited. When I finally decided on the right suit: they were out of my pant size. Luckily, another store had them in stock and they coordinated to ensure the process of my receiving them went smoothly."}
{"text":"If you've seen one outlet mall, you've seen them all!  With that being said, the Charlotte Premium Outlets are pretty nice.  The sales were good. Most stores had some type of buy one get one sale. Lots of 40%-50% off signs. Some stores to mention are Gap, Coach, Michael Kors, Nike, Asics, Puma, Torrid, Lane Bryant, Express, Banana Republic, Off Saks and a bunch more.   This outlet is designed to give the shopper an outside market, village feel. With open breezeways, street signs. Outdoor cafe seating or in some cases patio like seating.   The food court is an indoor cafeteria style eatery. With limited choices, it is designed to get shoppers back out shopping. Not really designed for hanging out and socializing like indoor malls.   It is important to note that there are still more stores opening and a few more restaurants in the food court waiting to open. So you will find a few venders like McAlisters selling sandwiches on the side.   I live 15min away, so I will be back often."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this premium outlet mall!!! Its a great place to go after work (during the week) especially if you don't like big crowds and long lines!! This is definitely my type of shopping!! The stores always has GREAT deals throughout the mall!! I love that its outside and on beautiful days its the perfect outing with the family to stroll through the mall and get a little exercise and shopping of course hehe!!"}
{"text":"I like to come here in the evenings during the weekdays; less people. Parking on the weekends is pretty hard."}
{"text":"7/31/14 is grand opening weekend for this new premium outlet off I485. With 100 stores at opening, this mall fills a need for both high end and mid range shoppers. Saks off fifth is an anchor store, it's large and well stocked with brands like Jimmy Choo, Christian Loboutin, Badgley Mishka, Alexander Wang, Wild Fox etc. There is a Kate spade store, JCrew, along with mall staples like Coach, Nike, The 3 Gap company brands and many others. The foot traffic was strong. Food court options are very slim, chick fi la is pretty much that option. There were signs posted of other restaurants to open soon.  Looking forward to future visits here"}
{"text":"Was there opening Saturday and the following Tuesday. The worst part about it was being accosted by a gang of teenagers trying to sell their rap album to me. Can't I shop with my children without being pestered to buy your rap album? I politely told a security guard I about the incident and he approached them in his segway and started laughing with them and they proceeded to heckle more shoppers to buy their rap cd. It will be a while until I give this place another chance.   I don't see any real bargins. Example: Guardians of the Galaxy Rocket Raccoon Toy $9.99 at Walmart, Toys \"R Us and Target is $15.99 at the outlet Toy shop.   Sak's off Fifth has a decent selection, but nothing too impressive. I'd rather drive over to Nordstrom.   Parking system is poorly planned. Mall is not complete so I'll give it a pass here. Hopefully once the surrounding area builds out things will improve. Food court not finished. By the way, Chick fil A should be ashamed of themselves for selling a 8 oz coke for $2.00."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to take your family out shopping. I really like the Nike outlet. There are other shops if that is not your feel."}
{"text":"When you think of outlets, you think of deals and steals. Charlotte premium outlets might as well be called Charlotte premium mall. Such a waste of time at this place. No deals. No steals. Just expensive shops with their normal prices."}
{"text":"Clean and some shade, but I got way more rained on than I'd expect at a premium outlet just walking between the shops, never mind how soaked I was getting back to my car. Why wouldn't you ante up for a little more cover even just store to store???"}
{"text":"We stopped by for a little shopping. The mall is nicer than most and has plenty of stores. It was a nice way to spend a few hours before heading on to another adventure."}
{"text":"Appears to be a new outlet in the Charlotte area. It has your typical stores including Nike, Nine West, GAP, and Banana Republic, to name a few.  Easy access from 485 to the area. Good place to shop. Some stores accept military discount."}
{"text":"I love this place. Started off at Saks Fifth Avenue where I bought a nice shirt. We wander around and ate at the food court (Kung Pao). Enjoyed the beautiful scenery around the mall area. I'm a watch lover as we went to Fossil and got a steal!!! Two watches for $87. Yes you heard me right. Original price was $265, Mark down price $129, got 30% off then an additional 10% off the total price (will explain this later). Grand total $87.16! Yes! Very nice outdoor type mall. People are very friendly. We were greeted promptly at every store we went in.   Now for the 10% off. Make sure you go to the Customer Service in the food court. They will give you an entire sheet of additional discounts that you can use. Some off 10% off total price other off certain items. Either way it's a savings at already low prices at this Outlet Mall.   Now we're off to explore Charlotte some more..."}
{"text":"I'm not going to proclaim myself a \"shopper\" by any means... Mostly because I just go to the store, get what I need, and go home the majority of the time.  Charlotte Premium Outlets really doesn't allow me to do this, but I won't fault it.  It is still \"finding its legs\" as evidenced by the empty food spaces in the food court, but things are shaping up.  It's nice to have outlet shopping on the other end of town (instead of just driving up to Concord).  The layout is very similar to any other outlet place you would find closer to the coast, and it's outdoor.  My biggest gripe is the parking lot and the entrance.  Coming off of 485, you can see the Outlets but the exit makes it feel like you momentarily get lost since it routes you away from and then back over 485- also having to go through another shopping center's roundabout.  I can definitely see this place as a good family outing.  You can divide an conquer or stick together.  It's not too too big so you can easily find each other, but unlike Concord Mills, there aren't any easily discernible \"neighborhoods\" so you end up using the stores as landmarks.  Overall I can't tell if it's a great mall since it's mostly just clothing stores for now... Usually a great one has a good mix of everything."}
{"text":"I give it three stars just because it is what it is and there isn't anything wrong with that.  I haven't been to an outlet mall in so long and now I remember why.  You think it's going to be a great deal, but it isn't. The prices aren't much better if at all and the quality is iffy - especially with shoes.    I guess it's good to have some kind of shopping out that way, but I can't say that I'd recommend it for any great savings or finds."}
{"text":"Great store options at this outlet. It is very well kept, very clean. They have lots of benches and comfy chairs for when you want to take a break or wait for fellow shoppers. Parking lot is huge and you have to be prepared to do a lot of walking! It's not very easily laid out as I was constantly getting lost but they do have maps everywhere. I did too much damage there today and will probably be back soon!"}
{"text":"First time coming out here and I was pleased with the selection of stores. It was clean too. They need a few more \"staple\" stores like Victoria Secret, Disney, etc"}
{"text":"Wasn't worth the drive. I was expecting it to be similar to the tanger outlets with a variety of store options. The food court was also lacking."}
{"text":"Great location and many excellent stores to choose from.  I really like the outdoor/open layout. Even on very crowded days, it doesn't feel as confining as similar indoor locations.  They keep the grounds and facilities clean and (despite a few issues in the past) I feel very safe shopping there. They are dog friendly, too!  I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the parking lot seems small and awkward to me and they don't have a Ralph Lauren store!"}
{"text":"So nice to have outlets so close to Charlotte. And at least for me, they are mere minutes from work or home. Lots to choose from and prices that are just astounding by comparison to shopping at one of these stores in the mall or even online. Some of my personal favorite brands are Eddie Bauer (which you can't really seem to find anywhere else anyways), Asics (similarly hard to find outside of a sport store) and Gap (and its related brands).  The discounts are rife and if you see anything less than 25% off you're being robbed. Hahaha! The stores are relatively slow, even on weekday evenings this close to the holidays. That is certainly to your advantage - shopping here is never stress-inducing experience. They have a food court with your usual options - a few \"meat and two sides\" Chinese places and a pizza place which actually serves up a pretty well delectable slice. Outside the food court there's plenty available for those of us with a sweet tooth - Lindt Chocolatier, Great American Cookie and Auntie Anne's (for the sweet&salty tooth).  It's certainly easily to get in and out of. Right off of I-485. Though be warned, the placement of the brand signs around the outside walls has seemingly no correlation to where those actual stores are in the complex. That can be frustrating if you're specifically looking for certain stores. Also, in line with my review of Northlake mall, this place is another testament to American over-consumption and that can often become over-bearing to me. I would never want to come here for a leisurely stroll and window-shop/visit to each store. That kind of stuff just doesn't interest me much anymore."}
{"text":"Loads of Chinese crap at normal prices, if that is what you are looking for. I don't know what the \"Premium\" is supposed to mean."}
{"text":"Glad to finally have a nice outlet mall in Charlotte. No more driving to Concord or Gaffney - unless you're up for road trip.  Disappointed that Gold Toe has already left, but it is what it is. Surprisingly, there aren't tons of restaurant options. I guess that is still in development.  Many shopping options to suit your needs and don't forget to check-in with the Customer Service desk to see what VIP deals are available.  Clean bathrooms and plenty of ample parking await your arrival."}
{"text":"Good outlet mall with lots of options. Only thing I don't like is the parking lot. It's so spread out and far away to the actual outlet. I guess I'm lazy. Mall is very well kept from it being new. Good range of stores."}
{"text":"I prefer these outlets above all other shopping centers in Charlotte. Parking is easy and abundant. No matter where you park, you will have a short walk. The layout of the stores is easy, not confusing at all, and convenient. The prices are better than other outlets in the area. I find that it is often way less crowded than say Concord Mills. I usually avoid the other Charlotte malls on the weekend but don't mind coming to these outlets. Its clean! There is a Starbucks. Also, there are some nice options now in the food court. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I live very close but I have only been twice because it is seriously crowded.  I think that if you could go midweek it would be much more do-able.  There was a Jos A that was convenient for getting things for my h....but FYI it is no longer there."}
{"text":"I found shoes here.  Yay.  They have a Charley's steak sandwich place, too, which isn't too shabby.  Good stores, and the service was decent, too.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! Got charged $10 to park all the way in the back of the lot.  The young African American gentleman thought it only fit to ask me to pay, but the African American and Hispanic young women that parked in the same lot as me were told not to worry about it.  This place is not only pandering to racism and sexism but they are also charging patrons to shop! This is just disgusting! I will never shop here again and I will be sure to tell anyone I know to stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Parking is a nightmare, but day after black Friday is understandable.  People are speeding off in the parking lot looking for empty spaces and lack of security may be a concern."}
{"text":"We have recently been here for holiday shopping and to get my wife new scrubs for work. Among the other outlets in the area this is by far the best. My wife's favorite stores (vera bradley, Kate spade, white & black, etc.) are all here and frequently have good sales. This outdoor mall is very well lit at night and is immaculately clean compared to other options. It is also much easier to walk than most malls. Parking can be a pain on the weekends especially around Christmas time. If you're going for a few particular items I would advise going Monday - Thursday between 5 pm and 9 pm (when the outlets close). There are no crowds and you can actually park within sight of the building. Overall this is a great pace to shop if you're in the area visiting or if you live in the surrounding area."}
{"text":"Beautiful layout and easy to navigate for shopping. I visited this outlet on 12/3/17 and although the parking lots were full it never felt crowded. Very pleasant shopping experience. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of driving out to Steel Creek when Concord is much closer to me for outlet shopping, but I really did not want to brave the madness in Concord during the holiday season. Charlotte Premium Outlets is a smart choice if you are looking for some bargains, understand what outlet shopping actually entails, and are willing to go earlier in the day to avoid crowds. I've never had issues with parking by showing up around opening time. I also appreciate outdoor shopping even in December. I think there is a decent selection of stores with something for everyone, including some luxury brands and toy stores for the kids. It is also pretty easy to navigate. I haven't checked out the food court, but food courts are not really my thing..."}
{"text":"I checked out Charlotte Premium Outlets towards the end of my visit to Charlotte. I actually noticed the place hours after I had set foot in the city. I was headed to TGI Fridays and noticed the stores.  I didn't need to do any shopping. I had got my fix over the course of the week. However, I wanted to do some browsing.  I liked Old Navy. I didn't need any clothes, but they had cool styles and decent prices.  It was pretty warm for a March day. I ended up not wearing a jacket. I sat on a bench and basked in the sunshine for a while. If you do need to charge your cell phone or tablet, there are charging stations around the outlet for you to use. You can pick up a cable at customer service if you need one.  I did enjoy shopping at the Beef Jerky Outlet. It was my first time getting jerky at an outlet mall. You need to ask for free samples, as they aren't out in the open.  Perhaps when I am back and have huge need to shop, I will do more damage here. However, I enjoyed window shopping at this outlet and am surprised that I had that much self-control!  (149)"}
{"text":"I'm so glad this was built. It has almost everything but has a great selection of store to chose from. It is also great for a walk too. I suggest going in the afternoon rather then morning or at night. If you love shopping or love a great walk. Check this place out."}
{"text":"Overall, I like this outlet mall. I much prefer it's layout with outdoor corridors thank malls like Concord Mills that have interior corridors. The food selection isn't great, but I guess it's pretty typical mall food court food. The store selection is pretty good. There are several stores that are my go-to when I need to freshen up my wardrobe - New York & Co outlet, Ann Taylor Factory Store, and Loft"}
{"text":"Fun outdoor outlet mall. Wish they had some type of fan or something to circulate air. But none the less, a good place to shop and not feel overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Yay! I don't have to travel to Gaffney!  I was actually there opening weekend ( cray, I know) and I was really satisfied with the selection of shops! It's got all my favs, so I'm sure you'll find me here once all the hype dies down.   Keep in mind, there's room for improvement and I'm sure more stores will pop up here and there! However, it's nice to have an alternative to club ratchet (Concord Mills) that's *actually* an outlet center! Plus, it's super close to my house, all but eliminating my need to travel to Gaffney, Mebane, or Concord Mills (unless I'm on a shopping mission for an epic deal)!  Finally, the shopping gods have smiled upon me! Happy shopping!"}
{"text":"Awesome selection of stores. Pretty good deals! I love that they have a starbucks in the middle of the outlets... great to grab a drink and keep shopping! This place is dangerous if you're trying to not spend a lot of money! lol"}
{"text":"Great stores, not enough parking.  Every time I go here, its road rage central trying to get a parking spot."}
{"text":"This place isn't run of the mill, and here is why:  - In addition to having so many high end stores - There is beautiful outdoor seating - Outdoor fireplaces - Lots of parking - Modern and beautiful! - Different experience from a typical \"mall\" - Just a ten minute drive from the Charlotte International Airport  What I didn't care for was that... - There are not a lot of choices for foods - The layout of this mall is not simple.  Not sure if that was by design to be unique, but it's easy to get lost.   - Some of the food trucks that are usually there aren't always.  For instance Ben & Jerry's.  Maybe you'll see them in their usual spot, or maybe you won't.  *Note: GPS/Navigation sites may not be able to help you as \"Fashion Way\" is a new street, and if you blink you may miss the turn off."}
{"text":"Pretty good, they need some more stores and better sales and or prices but its getting there. Since it is brand new I am sure they will take some time to get it all right. Tip: if you have AAA stop and get a discount paper to save a bundle. I found out after and could have saved 30.00 in total . A young worker at sacks told me. Thanks"}
{"text":"Love this outlet! I came here for a spur of the moment trip to window shop with my boyfriend. I ruined his favorite jacket and he needed a replacement badly so we wanted to see what styles he liked and get his sizing accurate.   Just FYI... Parking sucks. Like it's really bad. The parking spots are tight. I literally lived in fear that I was either going to hit someone or that someone would hit me.  In pure outlet style, the setup was perfect for window shopping and had an open outside set up. The Starbucks was quick and attentive. The Fossil was like heaven! We saw the food court and it had some good options. It was late so we chose not to eat. They had plenty of shoes stores. Overall, this outlet has a great variety.   We lucked up on our timing of our trip because Wilson's Leather had a sale and we went crazy. 1 mens peacoat, 1 mens leather jacket, 1 womens peacoat, a mens watch, and a wristlet for $200. I was shocked that we got high quality items for such a low price!  Overall, this is a good outlet. Not necessarily for the prices because honestly, some stores didn't have great sales similar to outlets in Concord Mills, Myrtle Beach, St. Augustine, Gaffney, etc. I feel like this outlet is definitely for people that have a more expensive taste due to the type of stores they offer and due to some stores not having extremely low prices. This is the place to go if you're needing a specific brand or have some extra money to blow. Also, every single staff member I ran across was nice and helpful. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"A-MAZ-ING!!!!!!  I saw this place as I was exiting the interstate and yelled, \"OMG!  I GOTS TO STOP!!!!\"  And stop I did.  I was here at approximately 10AM so there wasn't too much action going on to my liking.  I used the bathroom than took a spin around the mall.  Lots of awesome stores and if I lived by this outlet mall, I'd live here.  I'd have to bring my own food because of the lack of a food court (unless I missed it) but if that's the worst thing about this place, I'll survive.  Two words:  OAKLEY VAULT!!!!  This is the first place I've found an actual Oakley Vault store.  Check is Outlet Mall out yo!!!!!"}
{"text":"So, with the news of an outlet mall opening in Charlotte I was thrilled.  Living in Los Angeles and visiting Orlando's amazing outlet malls I was looking forward to checking it out.  I decided to take the drive, which isn't too far from me, early on Sunday morning.  The outlet mall opens at 10 on Sundays so a good time to go, before the afternoon crowd.  I arrived a little after 10 and the parking lot was beginning to fill up. However, I did not a lot of \"C\", compact, spots that too be honest are quite small.  And, the parking lot layout was a little off.  Needless to say I parked and ventured toward the mall.  I had a few places I wanted to check out, but also wanted to get an idea of how things were laid out. Unfortunately I found the layout very confusing.  And, as for the stores I was excited to check out, the sales did not seem as impressive as I would have thought for an outlet mall.  However, there is a great variety of stores, for items from shoes, kitchens, clothes, accessories, etc.  Unfortunately by noon I was a little hungry and the \"Market\", food court, is non-existent. There are only two places as of this past week, a Chinese and a Hibachi..yes, the same type of food right next to one another.  Not interested so I decided to grab a drink and head out shortly after.  The crowds started coming around 12:30ish... I definitely will give them time to get things finalized and head back.  Overall, nothing to write home about at this time."}
{"text":"I have been to a couple of these \"Premium Outlet\" locations and they're pretty much the same here in Charlotte as they are in Gaffney SC, San Marcos TX, Lebanon TN and Williamsburg VA. It's an outdoor shopping mall with some cover in some places but mostly exposed to the elements. Same shops here as in others, too.  Because this one is still new, it's very busy even on a weekday. And therefore it is a good thing that they have an ocean of parking as my walk from the space I was able to find to the retail was a pretty good walk."}
{"text":"My all time favorite place. I can never get enough of this. Being new to the area I found this place very fascinating. All the brands you get with very interesting offers in each store. Loved it."}
{"text":"Great outlet mall. My second favorite mall in Charlotte. It is very spacey and there are many stores to choose from. There are always great deals at GAP, Old Navy and the children's' stores when I go. The food options are not that good so I wouldn't plan to eat here but the location is great and you will find what you are looking for."}
{"text":"Yes!! I love this outlet mall. I think the sales area bit hit or miss, but they have great stores for all ages. Love that there is a cosmetic outlet store -the girls that work there were amazing and didn't mind us walking in right before they closed! Instead of having a bad attitude, the girl was joking around and making sure we got what we wanted/needed! Love that theres a starbucks right in the middle. Wish there were some heat lamps or something near the stores though... It's a long winter in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about having a huge selection of great stores selling items at a major discount?  Because Charlotte Premium Outlets is so new, it feels clean no matter where you are--even the parking lot. They do a great job of keeping up with the maintenance which really adds to the initial experience. There is a great lineup of stores from Adidas to Yankee Candle and everything in between. Truly something for anyone on your shopping list--including you.   There is a food court with multiple options and a stand alone Starbucks in the center of the outlets. It is open to the elements, so if you are visiting on a rainy day make sure to pack a rain jacket as you'll be exposed between shops.   Plenty of parking. Plenty of options. Fantastic prices."}
{"text":"Shopping selection is always good, but avoid the food court like the plague! Payed $10 at the Nathan's famous/sbarro 'stand' for a chicken sandwich and fries.. fries were a super small portion the the chicken was literally half the size of the bun (the slice of tomato was even thicker than the chicken)!"}
{"text":"What a cool Outlet. This is an outdoor one level outlet that has all the designers from the top to the bottom. I am particular went to coach and I think the number the other store was designer Footwear. But I walked around and the layout is absolutely Divine. It looks like a little cottage. Almost like a fairytale gingerbread town. I would definitely recommend going there to get your designer Duds at a discount price. The people who work there were kind there was a lot of southern hospitality. I will return on my next trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Thoughts on this outlet mall i like it but its just a little over rated. When i go i barely find these deals and discounts everyone speaks of ! It's cool in the summer/spring because you have to walk around outside so my opinon as it gets to the point of it getting cold and rainy weather i wouldn't opt to be caught at the outlet mall it's not much fun when its cold out. Saks fifth is alot of the reason why i really even frequent the outlet mall, you can get deals on parfumes,purses, accessories etc.If you need a quick outfit something simple i would definetly reccommend this outlet.Also a good place to go if you don't feel like  getting all dressed up,pretty,makeup etc and you just wan't to go out in bum mode in your uggs,sunglasses and joggers and have a high chance of not running into anyone yes yes yes outlet it is."}
{"text":"Great place to come find all types of deals.  The wife had a field day bouncing to all the different stores.  The food court only had three places to choose from to eat.  The bonus was the private section in the food court with the tvs to sit and wait till the wife was done running around."}
{"text":"Yes, they have all the stores and the prices are right but I think they can do a better job of signs, directories to get your store of choice.  Or is that by design? To have you wandering around looking for your store and hoping you pop in and do more shopping at other stores?  I found that if you use your Yelp check-in feature you're directed to Guest services where you get a list of discounts at the other stores.  The parking lot could be laid out better, much room for improvement. Why would you funnel everyone to the front of the all the stores where everyone is waking from their cars to the entrance? Watch out for the pedestrians or you risk reducing the local population!  It's close to the Hiway 160 exit off 485 but pay attention how you get in, it's not the same way you get out."}
