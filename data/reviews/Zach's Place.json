{"text":"Very much open and thriving. Yelp doesn't check the info that thay post with many good places missing and places that have been closed for years still showing. Make a call before you go. I have reported places closed over a year ago that still are showing as open, and we have ones like this that are open but posted as closed. Then there are the ghost or phantom ones that never existed. They DO NOT check the data."}
{"text":"It's been about 6 or 7 years since I've been here and now I remember why. We got a simple Reuben and Gyro to go. The Gyro was adequate/average (meat a little dry) and acceptable for the $6.99 price. However the Reuben was sub-par, especially for a \"Deli\". The meat was shaved almost paper thin (a sneaky way to make it look like your getting a lot) on tiny piece of almost stale rye bread. No cheese or thousand island dressing (per the menu description). For the $9.95 price this was less than acceptable. (my worth value would be $4.95) In addition, even the chips for both were all small broken pieces like they were pored out of the bottom of the bag.  The best part of the meal was pickle. I'm sure it will be another 6-7 years before I give it another try."}
{"text":"This place is not your traditional steak house.   No tie and little black dresses here.   It is a neighborhood bar with great drinks, decent selection of beers, and steaks on the menu.   The service was awesome and the waitress was attentive, but we were there on a slow day.  I wasn't impressed with the food.  Everything seemed bland and not seasoned at all.  My steak I ordered medium and rare and it came out cooked perfectly.  But even the steak didn't seemed seasoned.  I recommend the cinnamon dulce martini"}
{"text":"Yes it is a bar that also serves food.  They have booths there and also some tables.  I have eaten here a few times and have never had a complaint.  I always get a fish fry or steak.  Both of those items have always been good along with the salad and sides that accompany them.  The only reason I don't give it 5 starts is because it is just a little dark in there for eating but the food is great."}
{"text":"My sister, niece and I stopped in for the first time Thursday night. We try a different restaurant each month. We were NOT impressed.  My pork was so dry, I could barely eat it. The cole slaw was the strangest I've ever tasted and my strawberry margarita was extremely salty. The place had a very nice country feel and country music. It's clean and not crowded. The food, we will all pass."}
{"text":"I found this place very confusing. The sign on the building says \"zachs steakhouse deli\". Wtf does that mean? I enter and it's really just a bar and grill. The food was mediocre, the booth was uncomfortable, and the service was quite terrible. I won't go back."}
