{"text":"Falafel Xpress is a great place to stop in for some healthy and delicious Lebanese/middle eastern cuisine. They also have a variety of popularly available American sandwiches as well (someone excitedly ordered their famous Roast Beef while I was at the restaurant). All the food is made fresh, right in front of you. The rice pilaf was great! The hummus was fresh and so good it made me want to cry! They had a great variety of non alcoholic beverages and it was definitely a family friendly place. The server was really nice, efficient, and personable and THE BAKLAVA IS AMAZING!
I will definitely be popping in for more Falafel Xpress!"}
{"text":"The best place here for fast food
Everything and anything you order taste delicious
and the price is good"}
{"text":"I love this place. They are always very polite and the spicy chicken shwarma is delicious. I also enjoy the hummus. I'm so glad they opened here."}
{"text":"This is my \"go to\" place in Lakewood, when I'm in town.  I love the gyros, especially the chicken.  The chicken is so wonderful and tasty, and always tender.  The naan is grilled and fluffy on the inside, with just a bit of toast to the outside.  The best thing about their gyros is the tzatziki sauce--smooth and flavorful, silky texture that goes great with the fresh cucumbers, lettuce, onions and tomatoes.  My husband is working his way thru the entire menu. He said the Reuben is the best he has ever had.   Prices are great, and although some of the reviews state that there are not enough beverage selections, I disagree.  I find something new to try every time we are there.  They have a lot of interesting beverages that go really well with their food.  I love that they DON'T have fountain beverages.  This is affordable upscale fresh dining.  Don't insult it with a 2 cent fountain beverage full of HFCS.  It's clean and bright, with a few tables for eating in."}
{"text":"On our fourth visit to fx we tried beef shawarma and it was wonderful!  Juicy tender and perfectly spiced. We are still in love with the food here!  Gryos still as tasty as ever!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to Cleveland and wanted to try middle eastern food. Found this place to have 4.5 rating on Yelp and decided to give it a go. 
The delivery was really quick. The shawarma chicken rice was excellent. They served it with white sauce. We also had the shawarma grill which was chicken served with bread, fries and hummus. The fries were really crispy and the hummus was also excellent. 
Overall a restaurant worthy of money and time. We will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing food! Cheap, clean and the sauces are superb!! Ample parking available ! Very friendly people !!"}
{"text":"I can tell this is going to be a regular stop. The chicken shawarma sandwich was so yummy, and the tabbouleh was so fresh and green! Super fresh, super good!"}
{"text":"Best tabouli I've ever had!  Really good food at super affordable prices.  The garlic cream sauce is amazing.  The spicy green salsas are also great."}
{"text":"The Gyro I had was delicious.  The place is small. But you can see them cooking and preparing the food, which is a plus for me. Everything is clean. They have lots of combo options to go with your gyro or kafta. Their grape leaves are good too. 

Their gyros have fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions on them. Their gyros are decently sized. The lamb meat was seasoned just right, not too salty (which i hate). I would come here again."}
{"text":"Had seen this place many times when in Lakewood but I never stopped as I had usually just eaten dinner elsewhere. Today I was in the area for lunch and decided to stop.  Glad I did! Food was excellent and all of the staff was very friendly. The spicy sauce for their falafel? Sooo good!"}
{"text":"Kid you not, best falafel I've ever had. I dont know what spiced they are using but it is working!  We dined in and when the guy working realized he'd forgotten our grape leaves, he gave us two orders of them to make up for the mistake! I hope this place stays around!"}
{"text":"First time i went in here was because chipotles line was out the door. Best decision i ever made. Lots of variety in the menu. Cheap. And the food is phenomenal. The people are nice and laid back."}
{"text":"If you want the best gyro meat in cleveland come here. I want so bad to try other stuff because Im sure its just as good but I cant turn down getting it when Im here. The hummus, kibbeh, fattoush salad, and tzatziki is absolutely amazing. If you havent tried eating at Falafel express I highly suggest you do. Not only is the food amazing but so is the staff. Extremely friendly to everyone that comes in."}
{"text":"Philly cheesesteak and chicken shawarma were delicious.  Made in a timely manner.  My wife and I come here all the time."}
{"text":"You guys. YOU GUYS.  

Falafel Xpress decided not to utilize the E at the beginning of the word express, but I'm asking you to forgive them for this crime against spelling. The food prepared at Falafel Xpress is really delicious.  It is prepared quickly, and most of the menu items are between $6 and $10. It's freshly made, flavorful and fast. 

I'm currently obsessed with the kafta rice bowl. Three perfect little lamb and beef patties served on a bed of yellow rice with veggies with glorious tahini sauce and fresh parsley. You can order it according to how spicy/hot you want it.  Comes with warm and pillow-y naan. 

There's something for everyone as they have \"new world\" and \"old world\" items on the menu. You can get chicken wings, mozzarella sticks, reuben, etc., or hummus and shawarma, etc. they also offer vegetarian and vegan options. 

I think you'll Njoy it! (get it? ugh. I know.)."}
{"text":"This is a great new little carryout spot for Mediterranean / Lebanese food. Excellent falafel, shish tawook, shawarma. The gyro and grape leaves are my favorites so far and everything comes at a great price. My wife and I can eat well on a weeknight for $20 or less. Nice people and I wish them the best. If they keep the food at this quality and the prices this affordable, they will have no problem developing a loyal following. Count me in!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this one evening purely based on the high Yelp rankings.

4.5 stars doesn't cover it.

5 stars all the way.

I intentionally waited until after my third visit to leave a review.

All three times have been exceptionally good.

My family orders many different things on the menu and they are all happy.

I have been getting the falafel sandwhich and tabouli.  I am not sure what's different about their tabouli from other places but it's superb.

I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I love the food at Falafel Xpress. It's so good. We have especially enjoyed their old world wraps, kibble, hummus, salads (fattoush and lentil), and rice plates.  It's all great! All of the food is nice spiced, often with some cinnamon flavor, yum. Highly recommend! This place isn't really a sit down place although there a few tables inside if you want to eat there."}
{"text":"Excellent food! True authentic taste!! Quick service too if you're looking for a fast bit to eat! The staff is also very friendly. Personally, I think it is better than Aladdin's."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious! Falafel xpress gets the good out fast but it doesn't taste rushed. They always get my specific order right. I recommend the chicken gyro. 
Home made baklava is delectable, too."}
{"text":"I am very excited to find a place that sells falafel in Lakewood - besides Aladdins. I've felt recently that Aladdins just wasn't that great and was definitely over-priced.. Enter Falafel Xpress! 

This place doesn't necessarily serve the best falafel I've ever eaten but it is tasty and fresh! The menu is huge, with a good variety of Middle Eastern and American foods so that everyone can find something. They also offer lots of sides like hummus, tabbouleh, fries, etc. I'd advise that you stick to the Mid East food becasue that's what they specialize in! We got some mozzarella sticks as a side and they were pretty disappointing but honestly, I'm not sure why we thought they'd be great. They're definitely not there to cook those - they're there to make falafel! 

Food prices are reasonable and things are made pretty quickly. It's not as fast as the Chiptole next door, of course, but it's quick. Very nice staff, very helpful! Overall, I liked it and will be going back. I wasn't blown away but I was satisfied. I realy liked the tabbouleh - very lemony! The hummus was decent but, like the falafel, it's not my favorite. Still, it's a good addition to Lakewood and I'm happy that it's so close to me!"}
{"text":"Such a great selection of food. Fast, affordable and delicious! Staff is courteous and is willing to make whatever you wish. Ordered the gyro and was left feeling ultimately satisfied. Great flavor, tziki sauce really added a cool flavor to the gyro. Everything is made fresh right in front of you! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Falafel Xpress was yummy!  I ordered the falafel salad.  3 Falafels on top of their fatoush salad.  The dressing wasn't too heavy & the vegetables were fresh!  Das Mann ordered a reuben ( I found this hilarious as we were in a falafel place) and he was pleasantly surprised!  The sandwich was big, enough to split if you ordered a side.  You order at the counter & the staff brings the food to your table.  

The one thing I don't like about FX is that all the drinks are bottled.  If you want water, you have to purchase bottled water.  There is a $5 min on credit card so be prepared.  

The place was clean with a few tables. Eat in or take your food to-go.  I will go back, I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Was very happy with this place until just today. I ordered a shwarma bowl with all sauces ON THE SIDE and specified this several times when placing the order. When I got it, the food was completely drenched in every kind of sauce they had and basically in edible. Highly upset. We have been trying to call several times but the line is busy. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Good and quick if you're hungry and don't want to wait.  Portions aren't giant but are quality.  Service is earnest and kind."}
{"text":"I was really excited to see a greek place open up to compete with Aladdin's in the downtown Lakewood area. Tried this place out for lunch and had the lamb gyro with grape leaves on the side. This place is a fairly typical gyro/greek quick service restaurant, but actually does give out quick and friendly service. The gyro was tasty, although I wish the toppings were on display better so that I could actually see everything available. I also felt if the onions were not going to be sauteed, then the red variety would have gone better. But overall, good lunch spot and I also appreciated the fact that the menu offered Philly steak sandwiches as well."}
{"text":"The food is always on point and the staff is so friendly.  Best shawarma ever and the hummus...yumm"}
{"text":"I write this while cramming their beef kafta into my face right now. Just thought you all should know that. If ithis review is full of typos and grammatical errors it is because I'm only using one hand, my left hand. My dominant right hand has the more important task of cradling this beef kafta sandwich and navigating it towards my face like a deliciously seasoned little airplane. And that work is too important to interrupt even for a single minute.

Ever walk into a place and just get the feeling that whoever runs it is really trying hard? They're really invested in making it work and not half assing it? This is one of those places. It isn't a slapped together to make a couple bucks hole in the wall, this place is legit and should be around for a long time to come. 

If any reader is familiar with the former hot dog shop that occupied this space, you will immediately notice the full gut job renovation they have done. Prior to Falafel X-press it was horrible outdated, dark, there was no where to sit, and the space was not used efficiently at all. Now it is very clean, modern, bright, and there is a decent amount of comfortable seating (something I didn't think they could squeeze in that space, but they managed beautifully). I anticipated the seating to be cramped with other peoples elbows shoved into your face, but no. It is spacious with lots of elbow room.

The menu has a good variety of items, both traditional falafel type foods as well as american foods like philly cheese and buffalo chicken with fries. So it is good for groups of people, everyone can find something they like. The food and grill is set up right behind the counter so you can watch everything being made. I don't think I have waited longer than ten minutes (even that is pushing it) for three full meals to be prepared. I was impressed by that.

The staff there is very friendly and knowledgable, even when ordering for people with food allergies. The meals also taste really fresh, no soggy grease bombs here. They also have more varieties and styles of baclava than I have ever seen in one restaurant before, each one is very tasty. Crispy and gooey without being so slathered in honey that they are wet and difficult to eat. I also generally feed myself and my two room mates all for about $20 which is a great deal. Think about it, for $6 you can get a disappointingly familiar McHeart-Attack combo meal at the drive through OR you can get some fresh flavorful gyros that are made just as quickly as a fast food burger. I'll take the latter. Not just for the amazing taste but to also delay the time and severity of my inevitable stroke. 

For those wondering what sets them apart from the other Greek/Mediterranean joints nearby, you simply need to eat more gyros. No two are alike and it is always worth trying a new place. They all have their own little spin and flavorings. Plus, this has decent American grub as well (not just frozen chicken fingers like some places). Also, if you have to drive to get your gyros, this place actually has parking, a rarity in Lakewood.

The only little change I would make is that I would love to see them carry beer or some other casual bottled alcohol drinks. Falafel, kafta, and gyros all just go great with a cold beer. 

BONUS: They also have some unique beverages like Mexican Coke and glass bottled root beer."}
{"text":"My husband stopped in on his way home from work for Friday night takeout. Based on the good reviews from Yelp, we wanted to try this place. I ordered the gyro rice bowl with gyro meat. It was delicious. My husband got the shawarma wrap and rice bowl. My daughter had the children's cheeseburger and fries. My husband said they cooked everything from scratch. He didn't mind waiting 25 minutes because it was good quality food. We will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I eat a lot, and I mean a lot of hummous and falafel.  This has to be one of the best joints for a quick bite of falafel I have ever been to.  It's up there with Frank's Falafel House for sure.  

I've been there twice now, and I plan to go back again.  The hummous has a great tang to it and they include some chickpeas on top of it which was a classy touch. I ordered the falafel sandwich and it was delicious.  Perfectly spiced falafel, some nice hot sauce (although, and this is not to discredit this fine establishment, no hot sauce can top Aladdin's), all wrapped up in a delicious pita.  

I sincerely wish someone would bring this concept to Tremont, a quick, open relatively late, falafel shop. (I know dervish grill is here but I dislike it)."}
{"text":"Don't ask me why I came here and ordered a gyro instead of a falafel... but I'm glad I did because that ish was delicious. And way bigger than my face. 

You can judge a lot about a gyro based on the tzatziki and theirs is pretty darn tasty--very garlic-y, but good. Throw some hot sauce on there and it takes it to an even better place. The gyro meat was, well...  your typical gyro meat. But the grilled naan wrap was pretty effing great. Again, this thing is enormous... and there's really no way to eat this thing in a clean, non-slopfest way, unless you use utensils I guess? Anyways, I made it through 1/4 of this thing and gave up--I was too stuffed. 

They also sent me with some rice. It was warm, super-fluffy, yellow rice with veggies. Nothing to write home about, but comforting nonetheless.

Price-wise the sandwiches are pretty cheap, then the prices go up from there. They have a pretty large variety of delicious options. I was scoping the falafel salad, the rice bowls (umm... gyro rice bowl? YES.) and more. I honestly had a hard time sticking to the gyro because I wanted to try other things. 

Food comes out quickly and there are places to sit and chill if you'd rather stick around. I like this place, Lakewood."}
{"text":"Although I am not a fan of falafels I do enjoy other Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food and decided to give this place a try. I pulled into the Marcs plaza and easily found a close by parking spot. Once inside there was a short line of other patrons placing orders/waiting for food. When it came time for my turn to order the man at the counter was personable. 

I went with the Kafta Grill for $10.95. It has 3 formed meat chunks of a lamb and beef mixture that I found to be moist and seasoned just right (meat is made in-house). The meat comes with sauteed onions and green peppers on top of a pita slice with a creamy sauce and fresh parsley sprinkled on top. This platter also comes with fresh cut fries and at least a cup of hummus. The fries could have been cooked a minute longer, but that is just my personal preference for slightly crispy fries (any place with fresh cut fries gets points in my book!). The hummus is pretty simple but the garnish of whole chickpeas, parsley, and paprika really is pleasing to the eyes. I also got a big whole pita to tear up for my hummus and a side of tzatziki sauce to dip my fries in. 

For an after dinner treat I got one triangle of walnut baklava and one triangle of pistachio baklava at $1.25 each. The latter was not sweet in my opinion, more so it had a buttery nutty flavor to it. The walnut variety was sweeter and although I think it could use just a bit more sweetness (I like my baklava with noticeable syrup/honey), it was still good. *Disclaimer: I actually ate these in the car on my drive home so they were more like a pre-dinner treat instead. 

To sum it up, I think Falafel Xpress makes fresh, simple, tasty food that will definitely fill you up and still leave some for leftovers! Take a break from that Chipotle chain next door and get yourself a Gyro with that tasty tahini sauce on it! (Or whatever, I don't know what you like to eat).

**Update, get the grape leaves! You get like 12 for $5 something, they have a nice subtle refreshing flavor to them (lemon?), and you kind of feel healthy eating them even though there's rice inside."}
{"text":"We had the falafel sandwiches & hummus for our first visit.  It was fine but underwhelming.  I wanted to love this place as a fan of middle eastern foods and because I love to support local places.  But my image of this being my new go-to for carryout food faded just like the flavors of the food.  

The restaurant is clean, the service quick, the food is fresh, prices reasonable, the staff friendly but the food lacked the interest and depth of flavor I expected.  Amping up the seasonings and focusing the menu to excel in middle eastern choices could be just the trick.  

The menu has lots of options but an odd combo of offerings -- more of a sandwich shop.  The hummus was bland in flavor -- Sabra brand in the grocery is much better, the pita was rather dry but their business' namesake of falafel was the best of the mix.  Not the best in town but I'd say the falafel sandwich was pretty tasty.

I'm hopeful we'll see some fine-tuning to give us the very best middle eastern foods and remove the distraction of the other items.  A nice addition to Lakewood so go give it a whirl.  It's decent food just not fabulous.  Good potential exists so I will be back -- I know it takes a while to figure out things so I'll try a few more visits and watch for changes.

For the owners, I hope they will realize folks coming to eat here will be seeking great middle eastern carryout to make their tastebuds sing not the distraction of fries and mozzarella sticks, etc."}
{"text":"I don't know why I never noticed this place before. I asked one of the employees how long they have been there and she said 2 years. I'm sorry that I haven't noticed it until now. I ordered a falafel wrap and hummus and it was the best falafel wrap I have had in a long time. The hummus is light and creamy but could use a touch more lemon juice. Prices are reasonable and staff very nice. I will be passing Chipotle and going here more often now."}
{"text":"Literally the best chicken shawarma everrrr...Uhh so yummy and garlicky! And there gyros are like 5 lbs of goodness!!! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the worker had a bad day but my entire order was lousy. I'm sorry but this review is a must to warn true falafel lovers. My sandwich had nothing but some pathetic falafel and lettuce rolled in some chewy bread. I know real falafel as I am middle eastern. 

The \"platter\" was way over priced. It was fair chicken (NOT SHAWARMA) and salty baba ganoush. Fries were ok I guess. 

Back to the chicken..when u label anything as \"shawarma\" it has to be cooked vertically. I was given typical grilled chicken. 

My order was messed up a little but I wouldn't have cared if the man making my meal wasn't so careless. He was too busy yelling at a friend/customer. 

Never going back and I feel bad because the female cashier was really nice. Oh well. I know u guys can improve but I think I'm finished for good."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Amazing vegan options and the hummus is SO delicious (and I've tried A LOT of hummus in my day).  They are fast and reasonably priced.  Yum!"}
{"text":"This place was a quick drop-in mid-way through a night out with a good friend and boy was I pleasantly surprised. We shared the beef shawarma and falafel wrap. It was incredible. Be sure to request spicy wraps and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great gem! Great food, great service.... Great in general! Good price, and people are very personal"}
{"text":"Came in on a whim to try out this new business. Small place but they use the space effectively. The menu offers Greek favorites (gyros, hummus, shawarma) as well as american food (philly cheese steak, buffalo chicken, cheeseburgers). 

Got a gyro, had my choice of naan bread, pita flat bread, there were a couple other options (can't remember!). There were also various sauces to get including garlic sauce, cucumber, hot and others. 

Gyro was big, delicious and quick. I hope this place sticks around because it was great."}
{"text":"I do love this place. Why go to chipotle with this next door? The service is excellent, the food is excellent and prepared quickly! Also, great garlic mayo for French fry dippin' ;)"}
{"text":"Best sandwich place in Lakewood. Must try buffalo chicken. Doesn't get any better than that."}
{"text":"Passed this place a few times and it was always empty so I was a little scared to give it a shot. One day when I was really craving chipotle I parked and the line was out the door so I decided to give falafel xpress a shot and I'm glad I did salads are good, chicken shawarma is good , and the buffalo chicken sandwich is the best I've ever had. 

(Note: not the best drink selection)"}
{"text":"We had lunch here today and it was DELICOUS!  The place is very clean and the gal behind the counter was quick and courteous.  I had the Chicken Shawarma Grill and instead of fries I had salad on the side (there was a bit of an up charge for that...but it was so good I don't mind).  The hummus was fantastic and the salad was clean and refreshing.  I LOVED the garlic sauce - if you don't really like garlic...don't get the sauce, it was SERIOUSLY heavy on the garlic and so tasty.  My husband had the Kafta Grill and loved his plate as well.  The gal behind the counter brought us our food at our table and checked in frequently to see how we were doing (very nice) and to make things even better....she brought us a little desert on the house!  We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best Fattoush ever. Tried several fattoush salads in the area and nothing can compare. It was so fresh and tart and flavorful just what I was looking for. can't wait to try more menu items."}
{"text":"I've been here at least a dozen times. The chicken shawarma sandwich is to die for. The hummus is better than Aladdin's. Taboule is very good too."}
{"text":"It was ok. The chicken gyro was good it was made super fast. No prices on the drinks. It was a little weird to see fried American food on the menu. And I'm pretty sure the stuffed grape leaves come from a can."}
{"text":"This is based solely on the food prep procedures.  Went on a Wednesday afternoon and got a falafel to go.  The guy rang me up (touching my money) with gloves on then proceedes to make my food with the same gloves.  I was freaked out about this but threw caution to the wind and ate it anyway.  Needless to say 2 days later I am still not feeling right and it sucks.  Ironic thing is that they have a HUGE bottle of purel on the counter and a \"no bare hands\" sign hanging on the wall right behind the register!  What point are the gloves if you handle filhy money and then touch peoples food?!!  Watch out folks..."}
{"text":"Had to check this place out because I love falafel and hummus. I had the falafel sandwich and it was really good! The set up is similar to chipotle so you are in and out fast! 

I also ordered a side of their hummus and pita and it was delicious. They have a huge menu and I can't wait to come back and try something else. They also had a very friendly staff. Great spot if you're on the go and want a yummy treat :)"}
{"text":"First time here tonight. I came because of the Very Good reviews.  So I ordered a falafel sandwich for takeout as a trial; I mean, if they don't get falafel right, and it's a Lebanese/Mediterranean place, what can they do?  But they did and they did right.  The falafel sandwich was nice, spicy (per my request) and flavorful, not salty.  I will return and highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  We found it when my husband went up for the ever important Chipotle run.  Being a lover of Mediterranean food, he called me with the plans to drop the pound of burrito and give this place a whirl as its right next door.  I'm so glad he did!!  

I got the gyro.  It was amazing.  The meat was perfectly seasoned, fresh and just delicious.  I love gyros but I am always hesitant to order one because they are generally the food that keeps on giving, as in you're burping up gyro spice for the next day.  With this gyro, I don't think I'm going to have much of that side effect as the seasoning was perfect.  I also got a fatoush salad which we split, it was plenty for $3.50, not the best I've ever had, but it was still fresh and pretty good.  My husband got the beef shwarma with hummus plate.  It was fantastic and delicious.  He got it spicy and it had a nice little bite, not too salty and the flavor was great.  The hummus was really smooth and tasty.  

Our total was $18 for a meal that would easily be $30 at Aladdins.  Now, don't get me wrong, Aladdins is awesome as well, but Falafel Xpress is definitely going to find its way into our rotation when we want a quick, reasonable, fresh and fairly healthy meal.  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! We get the Gyro sandwiches two at a time so we can munch on leftovers later in the day. Their cucumber sauce is amazing & refreshing. They use fresh ingredients which is something you don't see to often. 
The Chicken Swarma is so flavorful.
Unlike some mozzarella sticks that can be greasy & not stringy with cheese, Falafel Xpress makes their mozzarella sticks crunchy and so cheesy! The breading is really delicious & gives you a tasty mouthful.
Even their new world sandwiches are always delightful. You can tell they take great care when it comes to making the food.
I don't enjoy hummus, but Falafel Xpress makes me a hummus believer. 
The staff is great, Amanda always knows who I am when I call & is always very friendly. 
Darryl makes a terrific sandwich & always loads up the sandwiches!
Lakewood is lucky to have this Falafel place & I am lucky it's so close to home!"}
{"text":"Hey now. I thought the take away from this place was great. I took it all the way from Lakewood to Chagrin Falls, and it held up great. The falafel rice bowl was tasty, and I easily made two meals out of it. My mother, with the chicken schwarma rice bowl, made three meals! Pretty good deal I would say for the ~$8 price tag. We also got the baklava large order. I have never been a fan of finger baklava, but overall not bad. Definitely not the best I've ever had though! Not honey-gooey-yet-flakey enough to measure up. 

I will say the parking sucks. I waited in the car while we picked up just so we wouldn't have to feed the meter."}
{"text":"Good food. Ask for it spicy! A little expensive, but a good alternative when you walk up to Chipotle and the line is out of control."}
{"text":"I love this place. From the enthusiastic greeting I get every time I walk in to the phenomenal food, I can't get enough. 

The cashier is too sweet! Always friendly and ready to chat while your food is cooking.  

The guys on grill are always ready to whip up deliciously fresh chicken shwarma and toss you some extra pickled veggies with your hummus if you ask nicely.

It's so fantastic to have an \"open late\" local take-out option in town. M-F they close at 10:30p! I am consistently impressed by the falafel. My fave is the fattoush salad topped with grilled chicken. You probably don't need the extra garlic sauce but it's come in handy when grilling chicken at home :)"}
{"text":"We have had carryout from this restaurant three times since moving to the city, and we have enjoyed everything we have tried so far. 

I love that the menu is clearly labeled with vegetarian and vegan items so I know exactly what to order - the falafel rice bowl is my current favorite. I usually amp it up at home with a little hummus and extra lettuce. Delicious. My husband likes the beef shwarma.

It has been busy each time we have called in an order, and it is great to see them doing so well. The people that work there are all really friendly.

I will admit that I was a little hesitant to eat here because of the name and signage, but it is a great little gem in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Very good. Nothing fancy.

The falafel is the best around and they get an extra star for being open a half hour later than most places. 

I usually get one of the chicken shawarma dishes- either with salad + rice or hummus and fries. 

Friendly service, I'm assuming it's owner operated."}
{"text":"Holy yum! Fresh made falafel within walking distance, I love it! 

Now, Maha's still is my favorite but this is different, in a good way. I got the falafel sandwich combo to go. The falafel is fresh made and has a good cinnamonny spice to it. The side of fattoush was huge and came with fresh fried pitas on top, so delicious. And of course I had to try the bakery. A few different baklavas and some jasmine-y cookies (I forget the name but they were so good. 

Oh, and everyone was super nice too :-) I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and service was super friendly! The prices were very fair and the food was quick and delicious. We got the vegetarian and the chicken shawarma and the fries. Everything was phenomenal. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So delicious! This is a go to place for a quick and yummy meal. I stick to the basics- chicken gyro and the falafel sandwich. Definitely go spicy on the falafel sandwich- so worth it. I also sometimes asked for tzatziki sauce on it as well. 
Chicken gyro is super delicious and the perfect amount of chicken, sauce, tomatoes and lettuce. 
I've never been disappointed here and wish i still lived close."}
{"text":"I love this place for a quick fix of shawarma. It's not healthy like Aladdin's, but filled with creamy goodness. Deliciously garlic and you can order it spicy or not. Definitely the perfect spot for a quick bite to eat. 

Customer service is friendly and efficient. They have \"old world\" and \"new world\" options, but come on. Would you rather have a burger or shawarma? Answer is easy for me."}
{"text":"Excellent Lebanese food. I always get the beef shwarma over hummus and a side of tabbouli. Authentic and delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and haven't had a chance to write a review.  It has to be one of my favorite places to eat authentic middle eastern food.  The food is fresh, affordable and served with a smile. I usually get a gyro with extra sauce and french fries.  The gyro is huge, and the fries actually come from real potatoes. This is defiantly a must if your in lakewood. Amanda behind the counter is the best!"}
{"text":"Bravo. You guys nailed it. Great location, excellent food and super killer-kool folks. We had one chicken gyro with fries and one chicken shawarma. The sauces in the sandwiches were tasty. Then to top it off we ordered one piece of baklava and got a second one on the house. Very tasty, not too sweet, just right. Under $15."}
{"text":"Lakewood residents now have a place to grab quick Mediterranean meals in Marc's plaza. There has not been a place to do so since La Pita Express closed their doors. I have had a few of the wraps here and they are all pretty good. A side can be added to each wrap for an additonal charge. The tabouli was zesty and served atop leaves of lettuce. I saw a young couple holding hands and skipping into Chipotle next door. I thought about how they won't be jolly tomorrow. You eat at Chipotle, you face a day or reckoning. Save yourself the sodium intake and bodily abuse inflicted by a Chipotle burrito and come next door to Falafel Xpress. When you eat falafel, you never feel awful."}
{"text":"No where near as scary as Midnight Express, the 70's film(with amazing Giorgio Moroder soundtrack) that details the horrible ordeal of an American accused of dope smuggling and sentenced to a Turkish prison. Honestly, the Marc's ten feet away is a more fair representation of a Turkish prison. And you couldn't order wings in Midnight Express. Yeah, I ordered wings. Not a huge fan of this ethnic food, but wife loves Aladdin(grounds for divorce). I liked that I could order a beef shawarma(something I've never tried till today) and a disgustingly American dish like wings. I definitely never want to go full Middle Eastern. I want a hint of it with something else to satisfy my stupid Ohio palate.

Wings were great, shawarma was very exotic tasting. Hints of cardamom and cinnamon. She had falafel. Order was cheap, quick and did not require me killing handfuls of Turkish prison guards to acquire. A welcome addition to the area."}
{"text":"Until recently, Aladdin's Shishtawook Roll was number one on my Lebanese chain list. Until I had Falafel Xpress's Chicken Shawarma. Holy moly, this stuff is good. The garlic sauce is great. The portion is, like, twice the size for a comparable price at Aladdin's. Get it spicy, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Second time I've been here, and I was really hoping this time around would be better -- it wasn't. The fish sandwich was extremely mediocre and kind of slimy, with really not much of any flavor. I got grape leaves (one of my favorite foods), and they were extremely soggy/mushy and not even flavorful. The fattoush (another one of my favorite foods) was also pretty mediocre and bland. Also, I'm fairly certain I was over charged for the food, the friendliness of the staff was very lacking, and the \"combo\" doesn't come with a drink. 

Basically, for the price and quality, you're much better off going down the block to Aladdin's."}
{"text":"WoW! Kafta and fast! This is one of my new favorite Mediterranean spots to grab a bite. No, it is not the most inviting place to sit and eat seeing as its in the Marcs plaza, but if you decide to it will be amazing people watching. 

I did not know this spot existed until I walked into it the other day, pleasant surprise. I ordered the Kafta and it ended up tasting just like the Kafta back in the day that my brother from another mother mother's made..? yeah, thats right. Anyways, they have all of your basic foods to go and quick. It was under 6$, so was the Hummus and Tabbouleh. San Pellegreno's for 1.50$ also, ill be back."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best places I've eaten at in the area. Period. I ordered the fatoush salad and had them add chicken. Chicken was tender and juicy. I was surprised by the portion size. Large portion. Small price. I worry this place will eventually become too busy as its not that big. I will be back."}
{"text":"Driven past this place a millions times. Took the Pointer from Steve and PW. And leaving more than satisfied. Got the kafta wrap with rice. And it was delicious. And they are cleaning the tables immediately after people leave. Very clean place here and the food is great. Don't go next door."}
{"text":"*Excellent* Lebanese food served fast at a fair price!

Falafel \"Express\" indeed, the food is ready super quickly and there is ZERO compromise on the quality. Perfectly seasoned gyro with all the toppings, fluffy naan, great fries (also seasoned) a filling portion size and a really nice drink selection featuring Steaz, fancy ginger ale, etc. 

This is a very casual lunch setting.

One person can eat here for around $10

If you like this type of food then definitely give it a shot."}
