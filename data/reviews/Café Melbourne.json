{"text":"Love this place! Even though these guys are Australian they do make excellent coffee. PROPER coffee, like in NZ."}
{"text":"As a fellow Australian who has spent alot of time in Melbourne I was excited to check this place out. However I was very disappointed. The two Australia guys behind the counter were unbelievably rude. They made the whole experience extremely uncomfortable and spoke loudly making racist comments. Sadly this has already been stated in a previous review I discovered. I am embarrassed to even be associated with people like that and they do not accurately portray Australians at all."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for breakfast, simply amazing ! I have been here a couple of times and tried different items on the menu and everything tastes great."}
{"text":"Good coffee, friendly owners, Wi-Fi.They might claim that their coffee is better than their French, but they speak very good French now."}
{"text":"I stopped by to grab a coffee to go around 5:30 pm (I've been wanting to try their coffee since a while now, knowing that Australian coffees are among the best) and was rudely told by the staff they were closed, even though it's written on their Facebook page they close at 6pm. It's okay to close earlier if they need to, but they should at least lock the door instead of letting customers, like me, enter the coffee shop and make them feel like their presence is the most annoying thing in the world."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best coffee in Montreal, and the most consistent. Deep, rich flavors, smooth, never bitter. The guy's a barista in the true sense of the word.  If you are a fan of the new wave of coffee- this is where you want to go.   Ambiance is good- relaxed.- Feels like hanging out in a kitchen during a long party. The guys seem sincere- they don't go over the top with politeness like Americans- they're Aussies after all- This works for me. The real important thing here though- is consistency- it's always good. That is hard to find in Montreal."}
{"text":"Suite à toutes les recommandations en ligne, j'ai décidé de l'essayer. Ce n'était pas du tout comme je l'imaginais. C'est plus beau en photo qu'en personne... Le personnel est nonchalant et semble établir des connections seulement avec les réguliers. En étant avec ma belle-mère australienne qui se sentait comme chez elle, je n'ai pas eu la même impression. L'espace est petit est mignon mais le manque d'expression faciale des employés refroidissent la place. Le café est pas mal et les prix restent dans la norme. Quelques options de sandwich sont dipsonibles aussi. Je n'ai pas eu la chance d'essayer leur brunch mais peut-être que ça changera mon avis."}
{"text":"Great little Australian themed cafe on St.Laurent, the two guys running it are friendly and more than happy to have a chat. They bake their own muffins and the jaffles were a nice reminder of home. Most importantly the few times I've been in the coffee has not disappointed,  well made espresso and lattes"}
{"text":"I'd been to Melbourne recently, and really enjoyed the plethora of soy \"flat whites\" consumed there, by me, in my insatiable and seemingly inexplicable need for nutrition, as shared by every living organism for all time. Living organisms can do a lot worse than a good flat white.  The gentlemen at the bar were friendly and helpful enough. Talked a bit about Toronto coffee culture, Melbourne coffee culture, and of course Montreal coffee culture. About the qualitative differences between soy and almond milk in a flat white.  Good cup of coffee. I'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"Relaxed Australian hospitality right in the middle of Montreal. Very decent coffee (and I'm very picky), grilled cheese sandwiches, and a low key atmosphere. Nothing fancy, but a nice place to take a break at while exploring Plateau/Mile End side of town. There is a cute little shaded terrace at the back of the shop."}
{"text":"Savoury, perfectly balanced and cheap \"Jaffle\" grilled cheeses. Best vegan and gluten free chocolate and raspberry muffins. Awesome service and laid back décor"}
{"text":"I loved their soy latte! The best I have tried in Montreal so far. This is my kind of place.  Unpretentious, lay back atmosphere and friendly!   Nice sitting area outside, good amount of tables inside. Cool Australian coffee place!"}
{"text":"Looked like a really cute shop. Was trying to grab a coffee to go 1 hour before closing. Came in and approached counter but was told we're closed despite there being several people in the cafe. I tried to verify the hours (the door was open) with barista and he got really annoyed with us :( I won't try to come back."}
{"text":"Une belle petite place pour bruncher ! Les brunch ne sont pas a tout les week end alors allez faire un tour sur la page fb avant de vous rendre !   Le restaurant offre des plats santé et délicieux pour dej. De plus, ils ont un latte infusé au cereal lucky charm qui est excellent ! Les prix sont un peu haut mais les plats son bon !"}
{"text":"So, I've come to an Aussie cafe in Montreal. Well, having had many excellent coffees in the real Melbourne (one of the great coffee cities of the world) I just had to compare.   My 4 oz 'latte' pushed all the right buttons. A solid effort, and definitely worth the 40 minute walk to get here.   The cheese toasty (with marmite, sorry, vegemite) was nicely presented with mini dill pickles and a few crisps. Nicely, done.   What I missed was a slab of fruit toast. I think the Australians have taken fruit toast to a culinary peak, and when I set out to come here, that was what I was looking for.   Nevertheless, if you're in Montreal you have to try this place."}
{"text":"Une petite place ou bruncher en comité restreint! La petite terrasse de derrière est agréable et fraîche lors des chaudes journées d'été!  Il s'agit d'un restaurant australien, mais ce n'est pas compliqué à deviner....puisque la deco de la salle s'en inspire! Vous aurez le choix entre plusieurs boissons du flat white typiquement australien, au Chai latte (ma passion...) en passant par le très original lucky charms café glacé... Le choix de brunch est restreint mais tous les produits sont frais et plutôt healthy et donnent envie de tout goûter! Nous avons expérimenté le smashed avocado et le toastie! Tous deux très goûteux et à même de remplir tous les estomacs vides!  Les prix affichés sur le menu sont taxes incluses, mais petit bémol pour les locaux.....ils ne prennent pas la carte de Credit!"}
{"text":"So I can talk about the Lucky Charm Latte but you've already read about it.  So I'll just quickly say that the chai latte is legit.  These guys have figured out how to make a chai latte that carries the complexity of Indian spices well and yet isn't overly sweet.  Side note:  sorry Oprah.  You might make a good president one day but your chai needs work.  Coffee is essential but so is food and they have many options.  First off, on my Tuesday morning visit, it seemed like it was a one man show from order taking, to food prep, to table service.  Hats off to the man who made it happen.  I ordered the avocado toast, which I know might sound sort of basic, but wow was it advanced.  So the avocado toast here is a combination of smashed haas avocados, Bulgarian feta and middle eastern za'atar on sourdough.  Its like the United Nations of avocado toast.  I would certainly come back here next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Simple place. Decorated on the cheap but with taste. Good coffee and house-made pastries--kind of homey-made-by-mommy, but baked and served by men :)  Australians specialties to come."}
{"text":"Location: On the main, in what I guess is considered the Mile End. Again, being a walk-everywhere kinda gal, I'm going to say that Laurier or Mont-Royal are the closest subways (5-10 minute walk from there). Street parking is available [metered].  The place: I wasn't excited or blown away by the space. First, there's one communal table that looks like it's made with plywood but in all honestly, I didn't go inspect the thing so I might be mistaken about the thickness of the tabletop. The bulk of the seating is bar-type, which makes it somewhat difficult to go there with more than one friend unless you don't mind talking loudly and shifting seats around so you can actually see your people, without pissing off your neighbours for taking up too much space. The decor was average, the place a bit dim, and they've got some Australian stuff for sale, mainly the dreadful Vegemite (though if you're Australian, you automatically love this).  The goods: I didn't like the coffee. Way too bitter and I'm pretty sure my Macchiato didn't have that drop of milk that is necessary to smooth out the espresso. It was more bitter than anything else and my teeny, tiny cup was half -full (at Olimpico, it's full - just saying'). That being said, I had one of their veggie muffins (savoury) and not only was it super freshly baked, it was outstanding. I mean, seriously f-ing amazing. I'd buy that sh*t in bulk.   Service: Leaves to be desired. I personally found the staff to be unfriendly and indifferent - I mean, what does it take to crack a smile? A can-opener? I didn't really feel comfortable when placing my order, but more like I was bothering them. Pas cool.  Price point: I don't remember how much I paid but if I recall, it was on par with other places."}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allés un samedi pour le brunch. A midi, il y avait pas mal de monde mais nous n'avons pas attendu.. Nous avons eu une table pour 2. Le décor est sympa, le service très bon (serveuse agréable et souriante); par contre, le choix de menu est assez limité, avec 2 plats sucrés et 3 salés il me semble. Toutefois, nos 2 plats étaient très bons, vraiment originaux! Seul hic de l'endroit: c'est assez bruyant. A part ça, je vous conseille de l'essayer!"}
{"text":"My sister and I buy the Indie Coffee Passport every year to plan sister dates and biking trips around the city of Montreal. She's the coffee connoisseur & and I'm the tea addict.   Good : I had tea. Surely you can't screw up hot water and a tea bag. My tea was fine.   Bad : The decor. I thought I walked into someone's basement. The guys behind the counter weren't very inviting either, and my sister said her coffee wasn't that great.   Bottom Line : I've always visited new coffee shops with excitement, but this one doesn't stand out to me."}
{"text":"It was my first time going to Cafe Melbourne today for their pop-up brunch and it was a great experience. Everything on their menu sounded like a wonderful treat for the tummy. I decided to go for the avocado toast with cheese and a soft boiled egg and boy was I happy with that decision. It was very filling and enjoyable. I also had a lucky charms latte and it was magically delicious...no really, it was a treat for my inner child and for my instagram page. Definitely returning to this cafe!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best coffee in Montreal! And amazing vegimite and avo toast. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Petit café australien bien sympathique au carrefour st laurent-mont royal! Dans le café, il y a plein de hautes tables le long du mur et une grande table centrale avec des tabourets. avec les beaux jours, on peut retrouver des bancs en bois dehors qui nous permettent de profiter du soleil! Niveau déco, il y a plein de petit détails en rapport avec l'australie: ballon de football, tableau, drapeaux, livres etc. cela nous met bien dans l'ambiance! ;)  Outre la selectiln de cafés, ils servent des grilled cheesd à la mode australienne (je ne les aies pas testé) et des footy pies! J ai également repéré des muffi s fait maison au chocolat et a la banane. mmmmh ils ont vraiment l'air super bons!  Le cappucino que j ai essayé etait super bon!  Un excellent arret café avant d aller escalader la montagne! :P"}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review because now they do brunch and it's the most creative brunch in town. Stunning presentation too. Great job!"}
{"text":"Having just returned to Montreal from being in Australia for four months, part of my culture shock returning to North America was the dearth of decent coffee. Australians take their coffee very seriously. This café was like an oasis in a desert. EXCELLENT coffee. They could have been a bit friendlier and a tad less cool, but certainly weren't rude or anything. I got my coffee to go and hit the antique store a few doors down, to peruse cool old stuff and enjoy my long mac, topped up. I'd go back, for sure."}
{"text":"These Australians are good guys, great product and friendly atmosphere. Made to feel welcome from the word go.. I'd come back any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Pretty good coffee. Pretty nice barista. Pretty normal price. Pretty okay interior. Pretty unmemorable. (Sorry, that wasn't pretty). Pretty polaroids of pretty customers. Pretty chill vibes.   Pretty good for the hood. Pretty likely I won't go out of my way for a cup but may/may not see this place a second time."}
{"text":"Coffee was really good, but service was terrible. Ordered 2 flat white coffees and they were really good. However my wife and I stood at the counter for about 5 minutes, making eye contact with the barrister countless times who was making coffee right in front of us and nothing..not even a 'I'll be right with you'. It wasn't only rude but it was really weird and awkward when he kept looking at us but just didn't say anything. We almost walked out, but finally a girl appeared and took our order but she want exactly offering great service either. One guy after us came in and left as he was sick of waiting! Both people there didn't sound Australian so not sure if management has changed?"}
{"text":"I came here for the Lucky Charm Latte.  Having the lucky charms on top definitely got me excited. However, the latte itself was subpar. Once you finish the Lucky charms, the latte is pretty bitter.   I don't know that I would recommend this because you pay an extra $1.75 just to have the Lucky charms on top!  This is a cute little cafe, and the breakfast/brunch menu seems delicious. But, don't fall for the hype of this latte. For $6, it's not worth it. It would be cheaper to buy a latte from McDonald's and a box of Lucky charms from the grocery store!! Haha"}
{"text":"I guess I like this place ok but it doesn't blow me away. I find the espresso sour without the richness of Le Couteau or Odessa or Arts Cafe. The space feels a little dark, and to be honest the sign outside about not speaking French particularly well rubs me the wrong way somehow. I wish them all the best and I'm glad to see they have a following but I have to be honest, Melbourne doesn't jump to the top of my special beloved coffee lists."}
{"text":"Really friendly atmosphere, the owners are funny and talkative. Simple, minimal decor. Bar seating, communal table, and patio seating are available. They also have great wi-fi (thank god).  Their lattes are generous in size, creamy, and quite smooth. Kitsuné is probably the closest reference point for the taste. They also have great savoury muffins and grilled sandwiches (jaffles).  Highly recommended for this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Solid coffee, great staff and tasty goods. I especially like their tall table in the back, perfect to work along side a short espresso. Great place to hang out."}
{"text":"Le Café Melbourne est un bon endroit pour un petit brunch. Les plats ont tous des noms de star et je trouve l'idée sympa. On voit que tout est frais ici et la preuve en est que tous les sandwiches ne sont pas disponibles a volonté. Ils ont un stock limité. J'aime bien l'idée mais il faut de ce fait arriver tôt si vous voulez avoir un peu de choix.  Coté prix il n'y a rien à redire c'est dans les prix des brunchs que j'ai eu l'occasion de tester.  En plus de cela le lieu et le personnel sont très sympa."}
{"text":"Wahoo! On a capoté! Vraiment un bel endroit pour prendre un café et c'est encore mieux lorsqu'ils offrent le brunch ! J'ai été charmée par le latte au Lucky Charmed et mon bol de smoothie était délicieux!!! Mon chum a pris les toasts aux avocats et c'était tout aussi bon !!  C'est vraiment un endroit sympathique que je recommande à tout le monde! Avec le beau temps qui arrive, c'est le parfait endroit pour commencer ta journée !!"}
{"text":"A couple recent lattes at Melbourne were better than the first (still good) ones I tried when they opened in 2014, enough to give them five stars from me and a place among my Montreal coffee favourites: Pikolo at the top, accompanied by Myriade I (Mackay), Myriade II (Saint-Viateur), Tunnel, Couteau, Flocon, and Pourquoi Pas. RIP Café Sardine, while we wait for its coffee to rematerialize at the promised new Maison Sociale.   Their food is satisfying and well priced. The menu leans heavily on jaffles, the sealed Australian sandwiches. They have a Breville press that's up to the very special task of sealing liquidy fillings like mac & cheese inside two fused slices of bread where it won't leak out until you bite down. I spent a lovely afternoon here reminiscing with a friend about her time away in real life Melbourne and chatting with the friendly co-proprietor. I like the coffee a little better than Hof Kelsten's across the street and competing Australian-themed Code Black's down the street."}
{"text":"Melbourne est un joli café australien.     L'ambiance est relax et décontractée.  Petite terrasse à l'avant du batîment. On aime!"}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try Cafe Melbourne for quite some time and finally got around to it - I had pretty high expectations due to the stellar reviews, but wound up very disappointed. To start, I had a latte, which was basically all milk with a faint coffee flavour. I then ordered the smoothie bowl, which wasn't really a smoothie bowl at all... it was essentially room temperature pureed mango with berries, banana, granola and some sort of microgreen on top. Everything came out to around $30 with tip. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"After searching online for great coffee places in Montreal, Cafe Melbourne was one of the first places on the list. Being an Australian and having spent the best part of the previous four weeks in America, I was excited to have the opportunity to have a great coffee.   The barister didn't seem too interested in having our business when we arrived. It really felt like he was more interested in talking to others that were sitting in a bar area in the cafe. We ordered coffee and some jaffles from the food menu, which seemed reasonably priced.   When the coffees were ready we had to bring them to where we were sitting ourselves. Surely if you're being tipped then this service would at the very least be included?!   The coffee turned out to be okay but nothing too special. The atmosphere was a little awkward. There was no music or anything and a lot of swearing from the guys who run the place. The food was good though, did enjoy the mac n cheese jaffle. Probably the saving grace for this review.   Maybe we caught these guys on a bad day but wouldn't go out your way to come here."}
{"text":"I have absolute love for this place. I went the 1st time in the winter out of random pick and we had to wait a bit in line. It was small and cozy.  By the time we sat down, it was around 1pm I think... the chef came over to our table to tell us that they only had 2 plates left. I explained I eat gluten free and he was more than happy to alter it a little to make it fit my diet. He's awesome, so smiley and friendly.  Oh. My. God. It was so good I licked my plate   I came back 3 weekends in a row. You have to as well.  Really.  Go, now!!!!"}
{"text":"Café Melbourne doesn't have a big sign out front but you'll want to find it. The barista was super friendly and the toast with banana and honey was delicious. Montreal definitely maintains the French attitude toward food - cozy cafes and fantastic fare.  I'll be coming back here again."}
{"text":"The lucky charms latte is amazing, and the lucky charms hot chocolate made with Nutella is even better. A bit pricier, but worth it. ~6 dollars for the latte/hot chocolate."}
{"text":"En direction de la pharmacie d'un pas pressé, je suis passée devant ce petit commerce qui vient d'ouvrir. Depuis les 2 ans où j'habite à deux pas de là, plusieurs commerces s'y sont installés sans pour autant attirer une clientèle assez nombreuse pour garder leurs portes ouvertes.  Curieuse d'essayer ce nouveau petit café australien, je m'y suis arrêtée le temps que mon expresso remplisse la petite tasse pour emporter.  Les deux propriétaires m'ont accueilli, sourire aux lèvres, et ils ont répondu à mes questions (Oui il y aura du wifi, d'ici la semaine prochaine, en croisant les doigts. Non il n'y a pas de café décaféiné). Le café est bon et fort et le prix est dans les normes. J'ai trouvé l'endroit un peu nu côté décoration mais c'est seulement que je n'y suis pas habituée. Je pense y retourner pour une petite séance d'étude au courant de la semaine et en même temps essayer leurs sandwichs australiens qui ont piqué ma curiosité!"}
{"text":"I used to be fascinated by the pics of Melbourne Café because the presentation of their brunch is really unique and the flavours very diverse. I tried once their brunch (on the coldest day of the year) and I found it a bit disappointing. 20$ for a red velvet hotcake with Lucky Charm adorned bacon and a handful of Tostitos, sounds original but the taste was not exquisite. Melbourne doesn't offer brunch every weekend and the lunch options during the week are limited, mostly grilled cheese with chips, which was not very savoury according to me. The coffee is quite good and the price is okay. The decor of the café is average, nothing extraordinary, nice and quiet during the week but quite crazy over the weekend."}
{"text":"I tried the lucky charm latte. You pay $6 for it and I have to say that for that price it is not worth it. The latte itself isn't anything special and he lucky charms cereal on top is more of a decoration. I did not happen to try the food, but it looks pretty good. But I would recommend staying away from this place if you are looking for a good quality coffee or latte."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying that Café Melbourne is pretty overhyped. I've heard a lot of people rave about how great it is, but I wasn't super blown away.   The café itself is not very big and I definitely wouldn't recommend coming here with a large group of people. The menu is extremely limited, however, there is something for basically every type of eater. This is one of the first establishments I've gone to for breakfast where my options weren't limited to fruit and/ or breakfast potatoes, so thank god for that. With that said, I do want to mention that the food and drinks are a bit overpriced for what you get. I opted for the porridge, which was good, but nothing special.   The service was pretty standard, but our waitress was extremely helpful. A few of us had some concerns regarding allergies, but she and the kitchen were very accommodating. Finally, I got the impression that not many of their employees are actually very competent in French, which is weird.   I had a decent dining experience overall, but it wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"Have you ever actually eaten Vegemite? I hadn't till now. It's some truly weird stuff and it made my mouth taste fuzzy all day.   Kind of expensive, kind of rickety, totally weird, mostly charming. What are Australians doing in a place this cold?? Ponder these things next time you get a coffee here."}
{"text":"Came here for their pop-up brunch. Food was absolute perfection but service was a tad slow."}
{"text":"First discovered Melbourne cafe when i just moved to Montreal, the sign of \"our French is not good but our coffee is\" definitely caught my eyes and made me feel home sick. I really value their courage of starting this little business in a new city/country. I ordered a latte and it was pretty good. I never came back for 2 years until they started doing pop-up brunches and my Toronto friend insisted coming here today- the Instagram photos of their brunch items look like real pieces of arts! At 10 when the store opened, it was already 95% full and their servers speak perfect French. The menu is insanely creative and the items are of extremely high quality. I'm so happy for their success in Montreal! I think we should all keep an open mind to try something new and give people a chance in a new city: I tried something new today- turmeric latte, and my friend- lucky charm latte."}
{"text":"Great little café with tasty Australian sandwiches. Great design and the owners are super friendly, best café in the hood, highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Café Melbourne regularly for awhile now. A lot has changed in the past few months and I hope they can keep their grungy Australian vibe despite their new direction towards food service.  As a coffee shop, they always have had one of the most affordable lattes in town ($4). Recently they started serving a bit more elaborate items (eg. lucky charms latte, turmeric latte hovering around $6), but it definitely caters to your instagram! With that, the prices have gone up a bit.   I believe that brunch is a regular thing now, and they have a few permanent menu items! I love the smashed avocado toast with halloumi cheese. I am always impressed with what they can pull off without a full on service kitchen. With their popularity, they have raised prices a bit, most brunch items are between $17-22. You will definitely leave well fed though!   They have hammered out most of the service kinks since their very buzzy start.   Would recommend showing up for around 10-10:15 to have a guaranteed seat. Place tends to fill up pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Grosse découverte en ce samedi matin : le café Melbourne. Le brunch était savoureux et l'ambiance agréable. Cet endroit cosy nous accueille sur des airs de house music, pendant que les hôtes s'affairent dans l'étroite cuisine-comptoir.  L'avocado Toast est succulent, l'assiette carribeenne = époustouflante. Sans oublier le bagel au saumon, un des plus cochon de l'île !  Big up pour les \" lucky charm choco chaud \" et le fameux smoothie \" chap chap \".   Indécis, ne le soyez plus ! Poussez la porte de ce charmant café."}
