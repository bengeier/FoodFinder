{"text":"Yum yum yum yum. This place rocks. I love their pizzas and their bruschetta with burrata cheese. I could write a whole review just on that cheese. Its awesome. They have half priced wine bottles on Wednesdays which is awesome. I also just like the bread that they bring out with your meal. Great place, reasonable prices and delicious. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This restaurant experience was excellent. My friend and I dined on a Friday afternoon using a Living Social coupon and the service and the food was out standing. I can highly recommend the artisan crafted pizzas .. we had the Ham and Figs and Salsiccia. The craft beers were very good, as was the house crafted Limoncello which they gave us an after dinner digestive. Highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Like taking a tour through Italy!  This Italian restaurant is a the real deal! The dishes are authentic and inventive and highlight local ingredients. The whole experience, from cocktails to dinner to dessert, is an adventure. The bruschetta was like nothing I had ever had - life changing! We went during happy hour, so we were able to try many different small plates. Every dish had something I had never had before. My favorite (second to the bruschetta) was the Stuffed Mortadella -- Crow's Dairy ricotta, parmigiano, pomodoro. It is a fairly small place in an unexpected location, but SO worth the trip. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. Food was better than average and the service was great. It has a pretty small beer list so that was kind of a bummer. No porters or stouts. All in all I would probably only come back on a special or another groupon because of the high prices."}
{"text":"My husband and i had the Groupon and decided to venture out on a random Thursday night date night, with our 7-month old in tow. Our server was Trevor (?) and his service was impeccable! He was super helpful and friendly. We had meatball appetizer and a lovely pasta topped with ribeye (YUM!) and a lemon berry cheesecake for dessert. Best of all, the baby happily played in his high chair and let us have a lovely parents' night out. Highly recommend! The food, drinks, and service were top notch. :)"}
{"text":"Such delicious pizza! As a vegetarian, I only had a couple options to choose from, but the bianca and margherita pizza were so tasty, I didn't need more options. There are about 35 wine selections. I was lucky enough to taste several, and all were wonderful. The servers were delightful, prompt, and well informed.This is one of my new favorite places!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night for my birthday with some friends.  Our server, Debbie I believe her name was, was outstanding!  New Yorker, super outgoing, VERY knowledgeable about the menu and explained everything to us.  Service was also prompt and every employee we interacted with that night was also very friendly and accommodating.    We ordered a fantastic bottle of wine that was recommended to us by one of the gentlemen that works there.  Young guy, friendly, seems to know his wines very well.  It was called Brunello.  2009 vintage.  We also ordered olives, risotto, and the fig and prosciutto pizza for the table as appetizers.  All were delicious.  For dinner, I got the Maltagliati pasta (homemade pasta).  Was fantastic.  Everyone else at the table ordered different dishes and everyone liked what they got.  Portions were a nice size too.  The server surprised me with a beautiful dessert for my birthday with a little candle.  Was a really nice touch and very appreciated!! It was homemade mint chocolate cheesecake, little biscotti, and a piece of tiramisu.  I not only recommend this place, but will also be back!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant!  I bought a living social deal, and took my boyfriend for his birthday - but I will certainly return without the incentive of that deal - the food was THAT good!  We got a great bottle of wine - the appetizers were burrata over tasty tomatoes and a pesto/avocado dressing - very flavorful - and a salad made with haricot vert, slivered toasted almonds, and nectarines.  It was fresh, crisp - and seasonal.  The waiter even brought us some bread to try with the tomato/burrata salad, even though it wasn't supposed to go along with the dish.  For our entrees, we ordered wood fired pizzas - the margherita and a proscuitto/fig/arugula pizza.  I have to say that these were some of the best pizzas I've eaten - and I like to try local pizzerias that don't have super long lines.........   I would have skipped dessert, but since it was included with the living social voucher, we tried it - and I would try to save room for it the next time for sure.  Even though I don't love nutella (yes, I'm probably the only one out there that can say this), their nutella pudding with fresh whipped cream was amazing - I could have eaten the entire thing myself!  except we had an order of gelato - 3 huge scoops of 3 different flavors - excellent quality.  Turns out, our waiter was one of the owners - that maybe explains how knowledgeable he was about the menu?  or his sincerity and passion as he talked about the food?  all in all - it contributed to a great dining experience.  If you've never been here - go - you won't be disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"I Love this place .. The service there is beyond Superb ..

{"text":"Another great lunch experience at SOLO.  I would encourage anyone to try and enjoy the food & wine at SOLO."}
{"text":"Was surprised at how good and fresh the food is here. They use all local products, even down to the meat. We shared the simple salad (so good that I wanted to lick the plate) and the coppa pizza...YUM!!! Even the wine was delicious and local (Az Stronghold) bought a bottle at the store. Check this place out, it's a nice family owned restaurant!"}
{"text":"so I have been here 5-6 times already. The food is beyond amazing, and the happy hour is great. If the Hawaii 5.0 pizza available you should order it....Yummy. The chef is creative in every effort, from food to drinks, beers, and wine. Congrats on the opening. And since its a walk from home, Ill be there often."}
{"text":"Amazing food, wine, cocktails, and atmosphere.    Things to look for.  Meatball appetizer I order every time.  They have a fantastic Whisky selection.  Also, they have homemade dessert."}
{"text":"Nice little trendy italian restaurant, hard to find at first with its awkward location, but the food was okay, maybe it was cuz we went at the end of the night."}
{"text":"True Italian cuisine and locally owned...breakfast pizza is amazing. Service is amazing. Happy hour is great. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"WOW!!!! Unbelievable find in SOLO Trattoria! Can't say enough about the amazing food, terrific atmosphere and warm hospitality of this family owned establishment. From the moment I walked in the door I felt like I had entered a friend's home - sit where you feel most comfortable, enjoy a relaxed atmosphere, no serving pressure (thank you Eli!), fresh ingredients, home style cooking and over the top, mouth watering dessert. Something so simple - rigatoni and meatballs - was completely out of this world and the dessert - a pumpkin, butterscotch and fresh whipped cream (orgasmic) - what a great way to end a day! Thank you Jackie - bravo!!"}
{"text":"My husband bought a Groupon deal, wanting to try a new place. They had amazing food and I cannot remember what exactly we tried! We just went with what the waiter recommended. Service was nice and there was live music! The mood was romantic and light, everyone was enjoying themselves"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, wonderful service. We were seated next to a huge, multiple-family group celebrating a reunion. This could have been a disaster but the servers took extra-special care of our three-generation table. Great wines, cheeses lovely. Everything was delish."}
{"text":"Great happy hour menu; $5 meatballs, $7 pizza, $3 beers and other drink specials.  The lemon blueberry cheesecake was very tasty - nice mix of tart and sweet."}
{"text":"Simply delicious!  If your looking for your next favorite little Italian restaurant to have a great bottle of wine and a perfect meatball, this is it."}
{"text":"I put a lot of stock in sites like Yelp and Trip Advisor and depend heavily on non-biased reviews, so I feel I owe it to Yelpers to disclaim that I know the owners of Solo.  It is family owned - guaranteed you will see mom Jackie and/or one or all of the 3 sons around.  I was a little leery of visiting a restaurant where we knew the owners - what do you do if it's terrible?  Turns out I had no need to worry - we left extremely satisfied.  Ambiance - I would describe it as modern Italian.  It's a smaller restaurant, so it definitely has a more intimate feel vs. the huge, noisy chains around the Valley.  They also have a small bar area good for happy hour or if you just want to enjoy a nice glass of wine and watch sports after work if you happen to work in that area.  Service - server was great; unfortunately I don't recall his name, but he was attentive, polite and friendly.  Food - my fiance and I went with another couple and we wanted to try as much as possible, so we ordered 2 pizzas and 2 pasta dishes and shared family style.  I should note here that their dishes are traditionally Italian (i.e. on the smaller side), where you can have a first course of pasta, second course of meat, etc., so I would not recommend ordering 1 pasta dish and splitting it for 2 people (although American meals don't last 3-4 hours the way Italian meals do, so I wouldn't order a first course and a second course - 1 will suffice!).  Also if you want bread and dipping oil, it's free but you need to request it.  They use Corto Olive Oil, and it's incredibly flavorful.  Anyway, we ordered the Chitarra and Fazzoletti pastas and the Coppa and Salsiccia pizzas.  Everyone at the tabled raved about the Chitarra dish, which is vaguely reminiscent of a spaghetti carbonara but lighter and with big hunks of pancetta.  I think we all wanted to lick the plate clean.  The Fazzoletti is a pesto-based dish with peas and while it was good, it was lacking something - we couldn't put our fingers on what, but it needed some kind of pop in the dish, like sun-dried tomatoes.  However, that's my personal opinion and what appeals to one may not appeal to others.  One member of our party loves peas though and couldn't eat them fast enough.  The pizzas were both delicious - the chef does a wonderful job with the crust.  The Coppa was a cheese pizza with chili flakes, and it was my fiance's favorite dish because of the spice.  The Salsiccia was my personal fave - sausage AND caramelized onion?  Sign me up!  We also tried a cheese board (mmmm cheeeeeese....) that had some great cheeses but I couldn't stop eating the giardiniere (pickled veggies) which accompanied the cheese and even purchased a small container to take with me.  Dessert (because dessert should always have its own section) - I was in a gelato mood, but I was easily swayed when I heard the description of the Nutella Budino.  It's a little like a Nutella souffle/pudding cake, and was so delicious I really did nearly lick the bowl - I kept scraping my spoon in the bowl for every last taste.  Luckily, the other couple ordered gelato so I got to try the pistachio, mascarpone and strawberry flavors.  I believe they said they get their gelato from The Grateful Spoon next to Postino, which I love, so it was no surprise how tasty it was.  Wine - LOVED seeing an Arizona red on the menu so I immediately ordered that (Arizona Stronghold Mangus).  However, I also tried their house Malbec (Ruta 22) and that was great as well.  Overall, we were thrilled with the restaurant and look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Excellent service very friendly and professional staff and service. It is a family business and they are fantastic at making you feel like you are part of family. Eli the bartender great people skills and good drink selection. Food is excellent and very well presented."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant and sometimes go slightly out of my way to have lunch here.  Yesterday I had their Verdure, which is essentially a roasted spaghetti squash dish with a bunch of other sauteed vegetables.  I added some chicken breast, which was prepared expertly, with a browned outside and moist inside.  Friendly and efficient service."}
{"text":"Ate at Solo Trattoria this weekend. Food (meatballs, acorn squash, rigatoni and steak) was very good, but service was a serious problem. Some of it was the kitchen and some was the server, but they did not seem to have a normal flow. We finally got bread an hour after being seated (had reservations) and all of our food (appetizers and entrees) came at once after an hour and a half. The owner was very apologetic but we weren't the only patrons waiting a long time (even though most diners had left). They also ran out of food. If you go, be prepared to wait and be flexible."}
{"text":"Great Ambiance and Tremendous menu.. Chef has created a gem with this Menu.. You cannot go wrong At Solo Trattoria .. Service, Food, and amazing Bar Service.. Thank You Johnny for making our experience the best ever ."}
{"text":"Absolutely the bomb.  Jon, the owner, is the man. So appreciative that you are there. His style is refreshing. By the way,  his mom and dad are awesome too. The food....as good as it gets. After you're done with dinner go up to the bar and strike up a convo with him. He's extremely knowledgable when it comes to wines.  One of my fav places to go in PHX."}
{"text":"Great little place.  The service is fantastic.  Nice, small but accommodating menu. Food is great. You'll want to Instagram pics when it comes out, the presentation is that good.  Love the local art on the walls. You never know which crowd you'll run into when you are there, but the vibe seems to always stay cool. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"SOLO has turned from a friendly, family-owned establishment, to a cheap, penny-pinching \"why-did-I-ever-think-this-place-was-decent\" restaurant. Long story short: we had a Groupon for a dinner for two (appetizer, dinner, dessert). We've been here before with a Groupon or LivingSocial or Amazon Deals (get the point? They're desperate for business). The Groupon happened to expire on a Sunday. This business is closed on Sundays. I didn't realize that because I often use Groupons ON the expiration date without a problem. Let's be honest: we all have lives, and sometimes time runs out on us.  The point is this - it's NOT a coupon. It's a GROUPON - something I paid for. If a COUPON expired on a date the business was closed, tough. A Groupon is different and should be treated differently. It's no more my fault it expired on a day they were closed than it is their fault they were closed. Further, nothing on the Groupon said the business was closed on Sunday, it's just how it happened. After two phone calls and an email conversation with the owners, they refused to honor the Groupon the day after it expired (when they were OPEN!). Groupon happened to be running the exact same deal at the time my Groupon expired. They gave me some B.S. excuse and Groupon ended up refunding my credit card because these cheapskates were so unreasonable - and I was right. Tip: don't go here without an online deal (they are literally everywhere, so you won't have to look hard). I, for one, will never dine here again, and I wish them the level of success they deserve (you can imagine what my thoughts are). Arrivederci! Speaking of Arrivederci, they have good food, and they aren't jerks."}
{"text":"Family owned business that truly cares about their customers! The owner, his son come to your table and spend a while talking to you... great atmosphere, delicious food!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a delightful dinner at SOLO last Saturday night.   We sat outside, which was pleasantly facing a courtyard.  So many outdoor restaurants are too close to a street -- this is nice to be away from the cars. The meal was top-notch!  We had 2 appetizers -- squash and beets -- both wonderful. The green salad was really good.  For entrees, the chicken marsala was tasty and the funghi pizza was out of this world.    Nice selection of wine complemented the meal. Our server was very attentive.  The owner also came around and took very good care of us. Really glad we dined here and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"absolutely amazing each and every visit. the food is amazing as well as the service. Love this family owned and managed place."}
{"text":"SOLO or Duo?  Well I pick duo!  Was reminded by my wife what a great time we had there with another couple for dinner recently. She was so right, a compilation of great food, live music, fine wine, ambiance and superior service made for a wonderful evening.  The art on the walls, personal greeting by the owners and cozy table set the stage for the evening's meal.  We sampled a big portion of the dinner menu, with the Risotto, Margherita Pizza, Meatballs and Chicken Picatta being standouts; we ate it all!   We were two couples there for dinner and by the time we left we felt like part of the SOLO family.  Will we return again, most definitely yes is the answer!"}
{"text":"Wow, wasnt ready for this place!  I was just looking for a quick lunch downstairs and made it inside this time (because I walk by it all the time).   I had the Salmon BLT at the recommendation of the bartender (Johnny)..... it was excellent. I usually go for what they recommend the first time in somewhere. Fresh warm soft bread, thick juicy salmon with a honey glaze on it, great side salad.  Service was on the spot. Given its unassuming exterior, and the high quality of the goods once I made it inside..... I was curious about this little winner that I stumbled on...and starting asking questions to the bartender.  Turns out its family owned and operated, and has a great story to it.  So its nice to support the locals.  Dont be fooled by its low key exterior in the Esplanade courtyard....take the time and walk in....and enjoy this gem.    The only drawback that I could find is that people dont see it from the street.  Good thing there is a huge parking garage and also a valet in front to make it easier to get to.  I have never written a yelp review....this place inspired my first one...  (No, I dont work for them or know anyone there....this just seems like a place that deserves some solid promotion)"}
{"text":"Great food, great place and reasonably priced.  I had the organic chicken and my husband had the Fazzoletti - so tasty.  We also had the Old Man and The C cocktail created by the chef which we really enjoyed.  We had a wonderful dinner and will definitely go again. It`s a perfect date night place."}
{"text":"They have some pretty good Italian food here. Their menu is one page, front and back, featuring good antipasti and an assortment of pastas - gluten free for a small up charge. I came with family.  I had their gnudi which came with braised beef. I thought it was an odd combination, but it tasted pretty good. It was nice to see it finished with the gremolata. I had the tiramisu for dessert. Honestly, it wasn't the high note, but wasn't bad either.  As for parking, I parked in the mall and walked through the underpass to get there."}
{"text":"Totally meh!  I've had much better. Went during restaurant week with friends.  Pizza was good but salad was small not flavorful.  Chocolate lava cake didn't taste fresh, I think it was from a package.  Waitress told me I had to order from restaurant week menu since others at my table were doing it.  I didn't want a three course meal but they were not accommodating.  Also says there is a beverage included but no beverages were included...  Disappointing for the price."}
{"text":"On vacation in Phoenix and found the Best pizza in AZ. Love the local brews. Service is fantastic and staff is family and friendly!!! Pizza is fantastic! Well done!"}
{"text":"Yummmm The ambiance is perfect and since it's a family run restaurant, mom and one of the son/owners were all over making sure my experience was top notch. I LOVED the Carbonara."}
{"text":"Came to solo for happy hour today. Had the delicious coppa pizza with an egg and the meat balls. Extremely delicious and the price was great. Eli the bartender is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place is close to a $$$ price level but totally worth it. Freshly made pastas and tasty food with a nice presentation. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable. The hardest part of eating there was trying to decide among all the great options. Great wine list too with some nicely priced wines and many high quality wines. A nice place for wine geeks. Had a bargain Sangiovese that was a really nice quality. And for digestiffs they had !3! Amaros among many other interesting choices. We had a nice Amaro tasting along with their amazing Tiramisu. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal last week.  We were looking for a good Italian restaurant close to the Embassy Suites - and found it, right across the street.  It was a Monday night so it was a little slow but that turned out to be great for us as the owner waited on us, spent quite a bit of time chatting and it was wonderful.  He's also knowledgable about bourbon and wine - he turned me on to a new bourbon.  Food was great.  I had the Maltagliati- can't beat pasta made in-house.  Hubby had a few appetizers that we also very good.  Fun place, great food, great owner.  When in Phoenix, i would go back.  It's a little tricky to find if you're not from the area, be persistent, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Tried the meatballs, chef's daily pizza, and the asparagus.  The aspargus was good and the egg on top added an great interesting twist.  But really there are 5 other pizza joints within a mile radius that I would choose before going back to SOLO.  That said, its locale is a food hub and if this was in the east valley or west valley this would hands down kill the competition.  The decor and ambience was nice (candles, fresh flowers, and the server was good.  The food had too many tastes that reminded me of a upper chain restuarant with prices that were a $1-$2 higher than merited.  I might give it one more try since it's a family business and on it's 6th week from opening."}
{"text":"I'm tough to impress, I'll admit. We ordered the avocado pesto w/ pancetta, pasta was undercooked, and the citrus addition (perhaps lemon zest?) was on the heavier side.  We also got two pizza options, prosciutto w figs & fungi pizza which is mushrooms and delicious Saba. I am very particular about crusts, and theirs left me wanting more, you know a base is good when you want to eat the crusts, you know? Not this time. Lots of bubbles, overall 5/10 I did love the Saba vinaigrette on the fungi though. For dessert we had the amazing tiramisu, which was perfect, not too sweet, light, just the right amount of alcohol flavor, waiter said they use baileys in it, which I thought was genius and cappuccino to accompany, perfect way to end dinner. I would go back to give it another try, I eyed a couple plates that id like to try, but definitely not for the pizza. Service was good, nice and quick."}
{"text":"What I love pasta here is cooked really well-- the presentation is deceivingly simple, because it appears to be plain pasta with a little olive oil and specks of seasoning. Any skepticism I had was wiped out when I tasted it, though-- really great flavor.  The interior is pretty simple, too-- nothing over the top. but sophisticated minimalist I'd say.  They do have a happy hour with some great cocktails. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"i work next door to SOLO and stop by often for the meatballs!!! Another favorite is the margherita pizza, I like to add avocado to it.   When you 'check in' you get a free dessert.  I recommend whatever the cheesecake special is. If no cheesecake is available, the tiramisu is my next favorite."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, amazing food and good selection of wine and beer. The owners are great. Wish I could eat here more often, I am always out of the state or country for work however."}
{"text":"We tried this place out for the first time for dinner. We sat outside, which was nice because the plaza has string lights, making it a romantic/pretty setting. We started off with the pork belly brûlée, which was delicious! The house mustard sauce made the dish! The brûlée added a twist to a traditional pork dish but the mustard/orange zest brought it all together. Must try!  I wasn't too hungry (we went late at night) so I just ordered the margherita. It was ok/not very good. I can't say it was terrible because it wasn't, but I wouldn't ever order that again. I didn't care for the taste of the bread and the cheese tasted like something you'd get at a chuck-e-cheese. However, I'm giving this restaurant a 4 because (well, for one, the service was fantastic and the ambience was great) but mainly because my brother ordered the Chicken Marsala, which he let me try, and it was AMAZING! They got the flavor absolutely right! I honestly can't say enough about it! We all kept eating his plate because it was soooooo great! I'm already salivating at the thought of it. I was actually very bummed I didn't think to order it because I kept wanting more, but didn't want to devour a plate that wasn't mine :).  We also ordered dessert (CHECK IN because YOU GET A FREE DESSERT!), I ordered the tiramisu but they ordered the chocolate lava cake. The tiramisu was ok. *Disclaimer* this is my favorite dessert so I try it everywhere I go that offers it, across multiple countries, so I tend to be extremely picky about it :). The chocolate lava cake was good. Overall, it was a wonderful evening and the food was delicious. I would highly recommend the pork belly brûlée and Chicken Marsala! Don't stick to the simple choice of pizza!"}
{"text":"I am proud to become part of this Culinary family.  Very rare these days to find an entire family united with one goal in mind, and that's to give all of Phoenix a delightful satisfying dining experience using nothing but the freshest ingredients available every day."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service and all around good value.  The Piccata was great, and my colleague had the salmon which looked awesome and he said tasted fantastic.  Try the meatballs appetizer.  Delicious."}
{"text":"The excitement of going to this place was way better then the experience of actually going.   The food was mediocre. Nothing to write home about. We had an appetizer and two entrees. The pasta was well made and well cooked.  The sauces had no flavor, everything was just bland.   The service was non existent. 10 mins to refill my water once. 20 mins to take our order, 25 mins to get the order, 20 mins before anyone checked on us, 20 mins before I had to go inside and pay. We were planning on getting coffee and desert but gosh the waiting was just intense.  It's like they were trying to write a suspenseful story but nothing ever happened.   Sitting waiting sitting waiting...   The atmosphere is confusing. Part chain restaurant and part sports bar. I can say that nothing about this place reminds me of great Italian cooking nor does it have enough of anything that warrants the insanely high prices.   It's sad when you are excited to try a place and you as a customer seem to care more about the experience then the establishment that over charges you.   I'm giving it two stars because of the homemade pasta. That is all... Caio.  P.s. I do not mind paying insane prices for an exceptional dinning experience."}
{"text":"Best meatballs of any Italian restaurant here in valley! They are moist, fresh, and you can go into them with a fork. And they truly do have fresh pasta. I loved the chicken marsala that comes with it. And the chicken was so flavorful, tender, and fresh with a delectable sauce and lots of fresh mushrooms. I just don't understand why people would eat elsewhere for anything less. This place really understands that using the freshest and simplest ingredients and letting them speak for themselves is the only way to really give diners what they deserve. I love the 1/2 off bottle of wine deal on Wednesdays! I just wish they were part of the US Airways rewards network as I would be here all the time."}
{"text":"It was just ok. Strange the reviews are so high. Maybe we just didn't order the right meals. My server was so slow and didn't seem to get this timing right about most things."}
{"text":"Quiet Monday night dinner with work colleagues. Breaking bread , which happened to be warm and accompanied by glorious oil and vinegar, was the perfect start.  Table full of appetizers- is there anything better to start the collaborative spirit? Entrees start to arrive and everyone is pretty sure they picked the best option.  Sharing highlights the reality- they are all fabulous.  Waitstaff was attentive and eager the offer feedback and suggestions.   Bathrooms were clean and well serviced.  Valet parking a nice option.   Location perfect for movie paring.  Will plan to come back."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant ...not a million options on the menu but a good variety and they do it all well.  Biltmore area Phoenix.  Appetizers tremendous"}
{"text":"Everything in here is homemade, and the restaurant is family owned. It's a gem, and is hope it gets the following it deserves. I had the Verdura, which is a vegan option, and a bruschetta that was to die for. The chef makes her own pasta fresh every day and her own Titamissu.. In a neighborhood full of chains, this is a welcome addition and I want it to do well!"}
{"text":"My wife and I saw this place on Yelp and saw a pic of a dish that looked awesome! When I got there it wasn't on the Menu anymore, almost 6 months ago, and the owner came out and he ended up making a new version of it and it was incredible. Great food! Great people! Definitely coming back here! Order the Gnudi"}
{"text":"Live music, good food, great location. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in our two pasta meals that were $20 each. The portions were pretty small and the food was barley luke-warm! The didn't offer grated Parmesan cheese or black pepper, which is pretty standard for most Italian restaurants. For dessert we ordered the bread pudding which tasted like it was frozen and heated in a microwave. Also, our waiter who was very nice, had pretty long, greasy hair (sorry) that was not pulled back in any way. For restaurant presentation and health reasons, that should probably be addressed.  All in all, I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a delicious Italian meal. You can definitely find other restaurants in the area that are cheaper and tastier!"}
{"text":"Love the local art on the walls and the family feel. The food was good, the service was a little slow at times however I think it is family run. Have been meaning to go back again to check it out."}
{"text":"An amazing place!  Food is fresh. Spirits are top shelf. Service is wonderful. This place is a gem.  Started off with the meatballs which were some of best I've ever had. I had the gnudi as my entrée. It was so good.  Great attention to detail. Even the olives in my martini were stuffed with fresh pimento."}
{"text":"Found this place while  walking around the Camelback Esplanade. Small place, all the tables and booths were taken or reserved in the back intimate section, so we sat at one of the high top tables closer to the front of the restaurant.  They also have outside patio which is  probably great when the weather is not above 100.  No misters so we opted for the high top tables.  The food was very good, our server Richard, made our visit enjoyable.  He was personable, knew the menu and checked in on us.  My friend and i had appetizers from the Happy Hour menu, he had the House meatballs (3 large beef/pork mixture meatballs), I had the Bruschetta, Buratta, lemon oil, cracked black pepper, mozzarella and basil)  Both of our appetizers were great.  Didn't care much for the Negroni, I'm more of a fruity drink person and switched out the red Sangria instead and it was wonderful!  For entrees, we ordered the Shrimp Scampi Tagliatelle and Salmon Cakes Calabrian chili aioli, local greens, tomato jam was good...the tomato jam was on the local greens and it was interesting...wasn't bad, just interesting."}
{"text":"Great family owned place.  Service was outstanding and the food was great.  Pizza and desert were fantastic."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great value. Friendy Staff. Will be back at least once a month. Great HH too, especially on Wednesday."}
{"text":"We are serious restaurant goers and attention to detail is important to us. We randomly found this place on Yelp and we were pleasantly surprised by the great service and quality of the food. The pizzas and meatballs are highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been to Solo Trattoria about 8 times for lunch and dinner and the food is always superb. They use quality, fresh ingredients and you can really tell!! I've had the chicken chopped, chicken breast dish, salmon, meatballs, several different appetizer salads and have never been disappointed! Solo is a family owned business and everyone is so friendly! And the desserts are so scrumptious! My favorite is the red velvet cake made with olive oil. It isn't always on the menu but it is out of this world yummy! I've also had the nutella budino and it is a very close second!! I highly recommend Solo!!"}
{"text":"Dinner was amazing!  They have so many wonderful Gluten Free entrees!  I can't wait to go back ASAP."}
{"text":"Our first time, a hot little spot in the esplanade. The pasta was delicious and the cocktails were spot on! We ordered the tiramisu and it was so authentic and perfect. Best of all the manager brought us Limoncello on the house... Love this pkave"}
{"text":"My son and I always make time for Mother-Son dinners. Last night, our dining experience went like this... When we walked by this Tratorria style Italian gem, we couldn't help but ask ourselves \"Do we want Italian?\"  We always ask ourselves this question before we walk into an Italian spot, because most times we are very disappointed. Being Italian you develop a taste for no nonsense GOOD Italian food made with simple, fresh, local ingredients. And the only time you can add the \"GOOD\" is when it comes out of my kitchen (or Grandma's kitchen). Except this time... WE LOVED THIS PLACE. And that's before we even sat down.  We were greeted immediately and allowed to sit where we chose. The waitstaff was more than helpful when it came to deciding on our Antipasta and Primi.  Our food came out fast, hot and fresh!  The special of the day, Maltagliati -- Pork belly, English peas, parmigiano, was amazing. I caught myself licking my fork over and over (And I was embarrassed when my son pointed it out!) We were full and HAPPY when we left. We can't wait to go back!  PS I love that I am the first to Yelp this place!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with local art on the walls. We started off with the salmon cakes which were delicious. I had the Negroni cocktail which was ok, I do like gin and gin cocktails  but this just wasn't my favorite. My husband had a martini straight up which was more stirred instead of shaken. Next I had the Pappardelle which was amazing!! My husband had the Risotto which also was spectacular, it had shrimp, asparagus and roasted red peppers. We also got a side of the meat balls which were melt in your mouth delicious. And for desert we got the Affogato and added the Amaro, and by suggesting of the waiter we poured the Amaro and Espresso onto the gelato and it was pure heaven!"}
{"text":"The staff is phenomenal and helpful with the menu. The pizza is best around. The crust is hands down best there is. We will be back."}
{"text":"Recently returned from a golf trip to the Phoenix area, heard about Solo Trattoria from another golfer, glad we took a chance and tried it.  We were so impressed with the food we ate there 5 of 6 days.  We pretty much took a tour of the entire menu and would encourage you to try anything on it.  The fact that it is family owned and has a creative chef interested in healthy preparations is a bonus.  Do not let the fact that it might be a bit of a challenge to find it on your first visit keep you from trying Solo, you will be deliciously rewarded for your efforts.  We will definitely recommend Solo to anyone visiting Phoenix and look forward to returning on our next trip west.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere , a good place to meet up with friends , celebrate a birthday, or any kind of fun gathering"}
{"text":"This is what happens when you combine fresh ingredients and outstanding talent.   Unquestionably the finest, truly authentic, Italian cooking outside of Italy.... And it's in Phoenix??  Yeah, unbelievable.  Must haves, Solo caprese Crisp pork belly Malloreddus (gnocchi, but not like you've ever had it) Napoletana pizza (outside of visiting a cafe around plaza navona, you find something this good)  If your not eating here, your not eating."}
{"text":"The best dining experience I've had in a long time immaculate service and tasty food can't go wrong with this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food and service!  Andrew was delightful server.  We will return. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went to Solo for my Birthday this year, which happened to be a day the restaurant's air conditioning was not working properly. In spite of it being a bit uncomfortably hot on an August night, the staff and food were great. Everyone really enjoyed their meal and I did as well. I had carbonara as I recall and it was delish. My husband had the gnudi and it was a bit different, but tasty. Our waiter was super nice and even cut the cake my family brought me, no problem. We also had the lava cake, a personal fav of mine (I'm kind of a connoisseur) and it was good, but not GREAT.  The shopping center this restaurant is in is a bit odd and it can be hard to find. I think they would benefit from a different location, but all in all, I would go back and try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"We had a great anniversary dinner tonight.  This was our first time here and we came based on yelp reviews.   All of the food had a unique flair.  We started with bruschetta with cheese dates and honey. Outstanding.  My wife had the chicken piccata. She loved it. Great homemade pasta.    I had the shrimp scampi pasta.  Delicious.  Spicy and more great pasta.   Desert was Apple cinnamon cheesecake. Hot apples with cheesecake yum.  Add coffee. Great.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been going to Solo since they opened over a couple years ago. I enjoy the quiet bar atmosphere, the knowledgeable bartender, and great Italian food. I generally gravitate toward the pizzas, but I have to say, they are not as good as they used to be. I can't believe I am going to say this, but I feel like there's....too much cheese?!? I know, sounds crazy, but either the amount or type of cheese they're using is not working for me (I had the Coppa and the Salsiccia), and I pretty much love most pizzas. The crust is still amazing, as long as the cheese doesn't start to make it soggy. I will probably try some of their other offerings when I go back and get my pizza fix at Nook or LGO."}
{"text":"While I was in Phoenix for a conference, I made new friends. I initially made reservations for 6, but picked up a few folks between calling for a reservation and actually getting to the restaurant. When I showed up with 12, SOLO did a great job of accommodating us. The hard working wait staff kept our wine glasses filled and service was prompt and professional. The pizza was great, pasta homemade, and caprese was tasty. I would definitely recommend this for a big group and would likely return if I am in this area again.  I would highly recommend the fig, ham, arugula pizza.  Live music on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Family owned Italian in the Esplanade/Biltmore area??  Figured it would be some chain or over-hyped, fancy, shmany place that had 'alright' Italian food, boy was I wrong!  My friend Eric brought me to this spot and I arrived a bit early, which gave me plenty of time to explore the menu.  When I saw chitarra pasta on the menu I knew they must make their own noodles in house, which lead to quite a quandary as to what to eat.  So, I waited and drank wine to help figure things out.  Eric arrived and we decided we needed assistance to narrow down all the choices on the menu.  The server and bartender were very helpful in getting us in the right direction and we ordered the Meat and Cheese Board with 3 types of cheese and their Copa...yum!  It came with dried fruits and various jams and a few crostinis.  Quite a large board for the price with great ingredients.  This was perfect for me because I wanted to save room for dessert.    We split the main entree (Bolognese)...holy amazing sauce!!! This dish was DELICIOUS!! Again I should note you can tell the noodles are made in house, YUMyum!  We got an order of meatballs on the side to go with it, which you really don't need because the Bolognese is quite large.  The meat balls are spectacular with perfect texture and density and the perfect size to eat them for a meal at lunch; it also comes with their amazing house marinara sauce.    Last but not least was the dessert.  The original plan was to get one dessert and then for checking-in I received a free dessert!!  So, why not get TWO??  :) We ordered the special for that evening:  A crepe with lemon filling and a milk chocolate drizzle over the top!!! I love lemon and chocolate, not a fan of crepes...but I am now! We also ordered the chocolate lava cake.  Again perfect!  The dessert was surprisingly light but decadent.  Great flavors and texture, but not overly rich!  I think the pictures speak for themselves; I had to take a picture of the desserts because they looked so delectable.    The question is not will I come back, it is how soon can I get back to Solo Trattoria?!  The servers educated us very well on the menu; there are so many things I still want to try: carpaccio, pizza, mussels, and all the veal dishes.  Also I should say they change the menu seasonally and the prices are very reasonable; I was expecting much higher considering the area.  This restaurant also supports local growers and has gluten free options.  Solo is officially my new favorite Italian restaurant in the valley!"}
{"text":"Trattoria Uno is a fun place that has good food and a helpful wait staff who are wise enough to make a first time customer a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, although a bit difficult to find, but when we found it, we were pleasantly surprised. The shrimp scampi and chicken piccata were very good and the tiramisu was way beyond our waitresses recommendation."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a terrific \"GNUDI\" dinner at the SOLO TRATTORIA last evening.  Appetizers of meat balls; delicious bread..super cold beer--all combined to make a wonderful dinner.  We like going here because the pasta is all hand crafted and all meals are unique.  the wait staff was a young man who was both funny and informative.  I give it 5 stars because they earned them"}
{"text":"We had reservations next door but it was way too loud for dinner so they took us here right away. Interesting menu with some really unique choices. I asked the waiter to turn down the music a little and she did right away. Just a few things set me off here. One was the \" bread o request\" which I initially liked but someone in our party wanted bread. So the procedure is the waiter \"prepares\" your bread which is essentially warming up and toasting 4 small slices of baguette. A laborious and time consuming task apparently. We had ordered a cheese and meat plate for our starter and they had a delicious tomato jam on there that would have been good with bread. They make most of their pasta here so I had eggplant parm with chitarra (sp?) pasta. I feel I am an expert on this dish and I am thinking the eggplant should cut easily and be tender not crunchy. Enough said. I wanted a little more sauce as the pasta was lacking sauce. The waited told me she would have to have some heated up. It arrived after a while cold as a stone!  The sauce was good even cold. I want to be clear we will come here again. It is not a low priced restaurant but the effort is really there and it's imaginative. I think our waiter was over tasked on this particular visit."}
{"text":"After a Yelp event in the Esplanade, my husband and I made our way back to the parking garage, intending to head to Sportsman's for dinner and wine (yes, we needed more food and booze after a Yelp event. We're pigs). A sign for \"50% off bottles of wine\" caught our attention, and the owner Jon reeled us in explaining the menu and their emphasis on local products.  We sat out on the patio to enjoy the last decent night before summer started. We chose an Italian red wine to enjoy with our meal. I loved that they offered to ice our bottle after the first pour. This might sound strange to some people, but it shows they know their wine. It was over 80 degrees outside so the wine would have gotten way too warm otherwise.   We decided to split a pizza and pasta. We got the funghi pizza which was a special, and I really liked everything about it. The crust was puffy but not soft and doughy. The toppings had a ton of flavor. The spaghetti alla chittara was also successful in my book, but my husband thought it was just a bit undercooked. He also was hoping for a bigger portion for the price. With the discounted bottle of wine, I still think the total bill was a good value for the high quality food we received.  We are so happy we stumbled upon Solo Trattoria. I know if we lived closer, we would definitely be regulars."}
{"text":"Just went for an Happy Hour for the first time.   It was a really nice atmosphere. I ordered their mussles with glass of house Pinot and I must say - it hit the spot.   I would like to go back for full service and then get back to you guys with more kosher review :-)"}
{"text":"We happened into Solo on a Friday night.  We shared the burrata, beet salad, and the gnocchi--all of which was quite good.  the gnocchi was light and complemented the sauce.  Because they were having a quiet night, they also offered us tastes of two other pastas, both of which were tasty and inventive.  Solo is family owned and is still getting established having been opened for just a few weeks.  Certainly worth another trip."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment after reading good reviews. On the positive side, we had a knowledgeable server who explained the menu in detail. Unfortunately she raved about every dish on the menu. We would have been better served had she directed us a bit more carefully.   We started with the pork belly appetizer. Flavor wasn't bad but this was the fattiest pork belly I've ever had. Kind of a gross start to the evening.   For main dishes, we shared a fig and prosciutto pizza (which was very good) and the ahi tuna. I've had lots of excellent ahi even out here in the desert. Unfortunately this wasn't one if them. Needless to say, $28 for a dry and bland ahi left me feeling ripped off.   To our server's credit, she tried to make up for it with a free dessert. While the tiramisu was very good, the right thing to do would have been to remove the $28 from our bill. Because we had checked in on Yelp, we were due a free dessert anyway.   Maybe they were having a bad night or maybe we just ordered poorly with a couple of our dishes, but I really can't recommend this place. That's a shame since they seem to do some things very well."}
{"text":"These humans provided probably some of the best, kindest service I've ever had eating out. They totally went above and beyond, my friends and I felt completely spoiled, one of them being vegan and they still catered to us. Worth every penny and the type of local business I love supporting and will continue to going to. Obviously the food was also excellent. One of the chefs cooked vegan for a number of years, so that was very helpful. Eli and Walter were fantastic. (Eli's wine suggestions were great) Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"One of Phoenix better restaurants. Very nice atmosphere. Nice outdoor seating area.  Appetizer - very fresh. We had the SOLO Capris.  Entree was wonderful.   Tiramisu was outstanding. The best I've had in a long time.  Service was very nice.   Living social certificate was well worth it."}
{"text":"Great food,wonderful wine selection and fantastic desserts.  Jon and his mother, Jackie, run an excellent restaurant together.  From the amazing fresh flavors of both food and beverage to a variety of delicious desserts.  I will definitely be going back again and again. Did I mention that they have live music??"}
{"text":"My mom and I went on a Friday night when there was live music from 6-9 PM and luckily we made a reservation because it was a busy evening. The owner, Jon, and staff were extremely courteous and accommodating; wonderful customer service.  We got surprised with an appetizer on the house and it was delicious. Well, all the food we ordered was delicious. On top of the great meal, the music was perfect for the setting. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The location is a little tough to find (behind Del Frisco) but it is a cute little restaurant.  The menu is rather small but the food is outstanding.  We had the carbonara and rigatoni and both were excellent. All fresh made pastas.   We also tried their fig and prosciutto pizza, which was outstanding.   I wanted to try the chef tasting menu but everyone at the table had to order it and no one else wanted to do it.  Service was excellent as well.   The only downside is the wine list is rather limited.  I definitely would go back!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food in town! A must if you enjoy special dishes."}
{"text":"We are at the Esplanade frequently and this place has caught my eye a number of times.  When a coupon came up, I jumped on it and we went.    The value of the coupon was terrific - appetizers, main dishes, desserts, and a bottle of wine for two people for $50.  I started with the cheese plate and it was an eyeful!  Much bigger than expected and I shared with my two dining companions.  My companions were also pleased with their choices of meatballs and pork belly.  I wanted the smoked risotto sans pork belly because I am a pig snob and they were happy to oblige.  They brought it on the side so the rest of my table could nosh on pig heaven.  The risotto was delicious and very interesting.  I don't know that I would have put those two flavors together but it worked very well.      My only criticism of the food is the desserts.  My companions ordered the pumpkin budino.  I sampled a small bite and the caramel sauce tasted a bit grainy as if the sugar hadn't dissolved all the way.  My red velvet cake was a good start but was disappointing.  It was dense as red velvet cake should be (which can almost make it a bit dry) but that's why you have cream cheese icing.  It marries everything beautifully.  SOLO served it sans frosting but with mascarpone gelato and \"ganache\" which was a literal smear and didn't add anything.  Honestly, I just didn't care for the combination but I was way too codependent to tell the waiter.   All in all, we enjoyed ourselves immensely.  The service was great, ambiance was nice and it was just a nice meal all around.  Truthfully, I don't crave Italian food very often but I would come here again."}
{"text":"From Camelback road this restaurant was tough to find! Find the AMC theater, and park in their garage. (The restaurant validates parking).  I came with two of my friends - we loved the ambiance. The art work on the walls is for sale and done by local artists. The seating feels intimate yet comfortable. Our server was prompt and we never waited for anything. If he didn't know an answer - he found out quickly.  We ordered from across the board: chicken, beef and shrimp. While the menu isn't extensive, the appetizers, entrees and deserts are \"over the top amazing!\"  Great place for a date! A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Solo is delicious!! Aside from the fact that the atmosphere is awesome, the service is phenominal, restaurant is family owned and operated.....the food is ridiculously good. Ill be back again and again."}
{"text":"This place is great causal upscale Italian."}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday night and were surprised to be seated right away. Everything in the meal was good. The bread was fresh and warm. My salmon was nice and crisp outside and moist and tender inside. Even the simple dinner salad was one of the best I've had with a very tasty balsamic dressing. Service was also good. Big portions. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service!! The food was fresh and very tasty. We will definitely be back to this fantastic restaurant. Such a hidden gem! Support the locally owned restaurants :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to visit. I love the beer selection and all of the local AZ beers on tap. Also the farm salad is my 'go to' meal."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place!!!!  Try the pizza!  I've had 3 kinds...all were glorious.  The guys in the kitchen here are absolutely wonderful!  And they use LOCAL & ORGANIC!!!  (They genuinely do...they don't just 'claim to' like many, many restaurants in the valley sadly.)  Hard to find a place with such integrity.  So excited they opened!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here during happy hour and was pleasantly impressed with the ambiance despite being in a mall. A great setting to sit down and catch up with my friend. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the wine and was gracious enough to offer us a few tastes before committing. Even the happy hour wines were fantastic. I had the mozzarella bruschetta which was light and tasty. Overall, a great value for happy hour and a nice place to settle down for an hour or two."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!  This is a family ran establishment with all the care and love to boot!!!!  Food was outstanding and the wait staff on top of every detail.   All members of the family take part in providing you a wonderful meal!!  The menu is seasonal and local!  This means that some of their ideas and main courses are found locally.   All the food is fresh and portions are perfect.   Even for a big eater like myself, I found it to be very satisfying.    We had a party of 20 and with a little bit of table coordination, they managed to sit and feed us within a very reasonable time.  Kitchen sent out entries together so there was no one left out for any length of time.   Live music runs till 9pm. But the owners asked them to play longer for us and it just made for a great evening.   I strongly recommend stopping in and having a great dinner.  I know I look forward to my next visit to this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Solo is still fantastic! Their menu is seasonal, so it's nice to try new dishes when we come in. Service has been consistently great and the food has always been wonderful."}
{"text":"If you have not been here before, it can be a bit hard to find as it is tucked in the middle of the inner courtyard of the Esplanade complex. The place is nicely appointed and the subdued lighting made for a relaxed atmosphere. Expect serving sizes typical of fancy restaurants (think nouvelle cuisine type portions), but the food quality is top notch. And friendly service completed the whole pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Having gone recently to Italy I now have a much deeper appreciation for authentic Italian food when I find it.  SOLO Trattoria is as close to authentic as I think you're going to find in Phoenix.  Smaller portions, lots of unique flavor combinations, and amazing wines.   I just discovered this little gem at the Esplanade and have managed to eat there twice in two days.  It's that good!  On my first visit I enjoyed a pizza and wine sampling with friends and as such was able to taste 5 different pizzas and wines.  They were all great, but the Albarino and Bianca pizza were my favorites.  In fact, after the tasting my friend and I stayed and ordered a Bianca pizza to share!  The next day I went back for lunch with co-workers and ordered the meatball panini.  My co-workers are both vegetarian so I felt I had to make up for their meat-free choices (of which there are plenty, so don't dismay if you are vegetarian!).  Anyway, each of us thoroughly enjoyed our meal and were sad that we could'nt order wine since we were in the middle of our work day.   I'll definitely be back, especially since I hear they offer half price bottles on Wednesday nights!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is magical.  Everything a local business should be.  My husband and I go here often and we are always treated great - never disappointed.    There are two things I love about SOLO.  For one, it's family owned and run.  I'm sure working with your family can be difficult, but the ownership takes great pride in running the restaurant as a family -to see them operate with such execution is admirable.   Secondly, their food is spectacular.  Even though the menu is so Italian I can't understand most items, I know that whatever I choose it will be delicious because all of their pasta is made from scratch and they put so much care into the food they serve.  If you go here, go big.  Order local wine, fresh appetizers, and home made dessert.  It's worth every penny.  Thank you SOLO for being such a great addition to Phoenix and my little Biltmore neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years. Great service and amazing food. A few months ago I hosted a corporate event / private dinner and the clients still talk about the great experience."}
{"text":"Not quite sure what happened the night we went. Apps came out fine but dinner was a nightmare. There were four of us dining. Two peoples pizza came out about 20 minutes after we finished the apps. It took another 45 minutes after the pizzas came out before my pasta and my wife's chicken Marsala came out. They were very apologetic and actually comped the food part of the bill. It was an unfortunate night. When the food finally did come, it was very good."}
{"text":"Sweet and Simple Review.   Atmosphere is nice, dim with accent lighting, classy ambient music on a Tuesday night.   We ordered 3 food items and two drinks.   The drinks were good with a decent selection of local craft beer on draft. 4 solid stars.   The meatball appetizer came with three golfball sized meatballs drenched in a chunky marinara sauce. We gave them 4.5 stars.    We also ordered a \"fungi\" and pepperoni pizza. Both were decent fresh and re- heated later at home. They averaged out to 3.5 stars.   Overall we enjoyed our experience and while it's too far to be added to our standard rotation, we're interested in trying the rest of the menu and plan on returning for a beer and app before any visit to the attached AMC esplanade theater."}
{"text":"Gnudi!  `nuf said.  Ok, I do actually have more than that to say.  Very nice family owned italian restaurant next to Merc Bar.  Love the hot crusty bread they bring you.  Pappardelle Ragu is \"almost\" as fantastic as my wife's nonna makes.  Desserts were terrific too.  But the real stand-out in my book is the Gnudi."}
{"text":"Excellent family-owned Italian bistro - they call it a trattoria, and even though they offer takeout the place is really more of a ristorante by definition.  Semantics aside, I have ordered takeout there twice and both times was 5 star satisfied. I'd consider dining there too - the place looks really nice inside with a classy/casual hybrid vibe, has a decent patio in the center of the Esplanade, and the staff seems friendly & attentive. It doesn't look like they serve \"family-style\" Italian meals, but the menu seems based off of family recipes and supposedly the pastas are made in-house.  To be clear, my review is based off of 2 takeout orders, both on Thursday when they offer terrific lunch specials. I had the meatball sandwich the first time, and the Coppa pizza the 2nd time. Each meal cost $7 - the value here cannot be overstated. For $7 I got a heck of a fine lunch served to me. The meatball sub was delicious - on a nice toasted bun, and the meatballs tasted moist, seasoned, and homemade. Then I tried the Coppa pizza - which had a nice light airy crust that wasn't dry or greasy, topped with coppa (the Canadian term for capocollo), tomato, mozzarella, and parmigiana. It was really good, but for $7 it can be upgraded to fantastic. Not quite Chris Bianco good, but better than most pizzerias out there.  I work in the Biltmore area, and that is easily the best lunch special around - high quality food at fast food prices! Can't beat that, especially from a nice restaurant in the Esplanade. I was pleasantly surprised at how accessible and convenient Solo is - I've had to wait longer, spend more $ and eat lesser food at the corner takeout deli next door!  I look forward to having dinner there sometime soon and am glad there is a family-owned business worth supporting."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is a hidden gem!! I came here with girlfriends after some cocktails at Camby the other night and we had the most amazing meal, with even better service!   I had a delicious glass of Chardonnay to start and then ordered the Chicken Piccata. It was literally one of the best versions of Chicken Piccata that i've ever had! HOMEMADE pasta, the sauce was slightly creamy but heavenly, and it was loaded with capers {my favorite!}. The chicken was not breaded which was a major plus. The chicken was marinated and covered in delicious spices. I also tasted my girlfriend's margherita pizza and it was phenomenal as well. I cannot wait to come back and try more of their delicious dishes!   Check-in on Yelp for a free dessert! AND for the cherry on top, their patio is DOG FRIENDLY! Woot!"}
{"text":"Unsuspected gem hidden among office buildings.   We arrived for a 5:30 reservation (just before dark) on a Thursday for our date night. The hostess seated is outside as requested and conveyed our Living Social coupon to our server and validated our parking ticket.  Our server was prompt and knowledgeable explaining our coupon and providing her suggestions. We ordered the roasted acorn squash with burrata and meatball appetizers. The meatballs were wonderful - tender, moist, and flavorful. I don't believe I've ever had a meatball that good. The acorn squash was good but the squash was a little dry and a bit bland (which the burrata helped with). The meatballs definitely outshined the squash.   For entrees, we had the gnudi and the Sardinian gnocchi. The Gnudi was yummy with fall-off-the-fork braised beef and mozzarella dumplings in a delicious (but slightly salty) sauce. I agree with another reviewer that it might be best for the kitchen to leave the salting more to the table (but alas, seasonings were strangely absent from the table). The Gnocchi was a bit on the chewy side - but fun, tasty, and definitely NOT mushy. The tomato-based sauce was excellent. The accompanying fennel sausage seemed a bit over-cooked and dry - I'm not sure if that was intentional or not.   For dessert, we ordered an digestive, decaf, tiramisu and the gelato trio. The \"digestive\" turned out to be a type of tequila (first time I've heard tequila be called a digestive) and the decaf was a very hot, but a little underwhelming. The tiramisu and gelato were very nice, but I didn't think they were much to write home about. Not great, but good. Nothing specific stood out.    Unfortunately, as the evening progressed and the place got more busy, our server became more and more absent. We could see she was busy, but we were lacking in water and coffee service and waiting a bit longer than comfortable between the entree and dessert.    Overall, it was a good experience. We did enjoy the food and the atmosphere and I'm sure we'll be back for another special night's experience."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on our vacation to Phx (I bought a Groupon after reading other good Yelp reviews).  Excellent food and service.  My husband and I both had cocktails, mine was OK but his sangria was very good.  My husband ordered the meatball sandwich which was very good - the bread was soft and kept the meatballs, sauce and cheese within the sandwich and not making a big mess.  The meatballs were very tasty.  I had the ham & figs pizza - it was delicious.  I couldn't finish it, but I took the leftovers home and am looking forward to finishing them!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our visit here. Solo Trattoria is a nice casual restaurant in the Biltmore area Their menu has an Italian theme to it as well as a great selection of wine and beers. We ordered the Coppa and Salsiccia pizzas and found both of them delicious (especially the Coppa). I really enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant and the service was top notch. A great place for a date or happy hour. The reviews here are great and I couldn't agree more.  (Note: The restaurant is inside the Camelback Esplanade. You can park in the garage and Solo Trattoria will validate your parking)"}
{"text":"Good food and great atmosphere. We come from California a few times a year to see our daughter, who attends Grand Canyon University. We are always on yelp looking for new adventures. So far we have not been disappointed. Solo was a great new place, and we will return. The 1/2 off a bottle for \"Wine Wednesday\" clenched the deal."}
{"text":"Visited solo over the weekend to give it a try after passing it many times, but never stopping in. We began with the pork belly, which had an amazing bark on it, and was a very generous portion. It was served with a mustard sauce and orange zest that was different, but a welcome surprise. For my main course I had the Gnudi (sp) that is made by stuffing ravioli shells with ricotta cheese prior to boiling, and served with braised beef with a spicy red sauce. One word: amazing. I'll definitely be going back for that dish as well as for some of the amazing (possibly scratch made) cheesecake we had for desert. Bravo, Solo."}
{"text":"Excellent food on all our visits. Went with a friend on a gluten-free diet. The gluten-free pasta w pomodoro sauce is worth another visit."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place.  The food is original, subtle, and compelling.  The service is top-notch.  If you like food, you have to try this place.  Look at their website for the happy hour deals, where you get to pay mom-and pop prices for brilliant food.  I tried 6 kinds of pizza as part of a free sampler, and then meatballs and grilled asparagus.  Also, the best pizza dough I've ever had.  Everything showcased the special tastes of a chef who is skillful, super-experienced, and involved."}
{"text":"This is an unbelievable restaurant. The food was great and the service was quick, helpful, and very friendly. I came here with a group of friends on a Friday night and we were seated in under a minute. They put the Cardinals game on for us with no hesitation and even gave us a nice discount. I highly recommend going here for any occasion."}
{"text":"We are completely in awe of this restaurant with the combination of their food, service & ambience all rolled up into one!! With that being said we chose this spot to celebrate our wedding anniversary & without fail & as always zero complaints so glad that we did!! Love the low key not over pretentious feel of this restaurant, never liked the spots where people go to just to say they've been to, FYI relocated from Miami & stick a fork in us because we're so done with that, lol!! Upon being seated we were greeted by our previous server Richard who is beyond attentive without being too much so & we went with our norm the meat & cheese board, no complaints........ fresh selection of cheese & meat to choose from with your freshly pickled veggies, yes delish!! Entrees my hubby chose the chicken piccata & he was so glad he did, he requested light capers which they granted & the dish which was topped on a bed of freshly made pasta was pure heaven in the mouth!! Myself chose the spaghetti & meatballs since we had a sampling of their homemade meatballs last time & I couldn't stop thinking of them since then & I chose another pasta that was made in house since the spaghetti wasn't, FYI yes they keep it real with you, lol!! OMG I thought my homemade meatballs were good but their chef has a thing or two to teach me, lol!!' Pure heaven, yes I was on cloud nine & to be honest I normally don't order something that I personally specialize in with my homecooking but their meatballs were so d**n good I could order them every time!! Okay enough about their balls, for the desert we chose or actually I chose the desert with the gelato, a side of espresso & liquor, then the homemade biscotti........ pour the espresso on the gelato, top with liquor & dip your biscotti into the concoction & there you go.... done deal perfect ending to a perfect meal & another wonderful year with my beautiful husband!! Thank you, Solo Tratoria for a wonderful evening.......you definitely have lifelong customers here!! See you soon!! P.S. Thank you also Richard for the fantastic service & hats off to the chefs who do know a thing or two in their kitchen!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix, where I have lived over the years.  I looked up a few restaurants and decided to take my son here for his birthday dinner. The atmosphere was pleasant, decent lighting etc, and there were very few people there-- which can make enjoying conversation more pleasant.   Perfect for tonight, I thought.  Our waiter was attentive and offered drinks, but we passed.  My son requested an appetizer that our waiter later informed us was not available.  It was a disappointing start and I was hoping we did not make the wrong choice.  My son was ok with that and decided to ordered steak shoulder, which he was very happy with.  It was dressed with mushrooms and a brown beef based gravy.  The steak was prepared medium rare and my son had no complaints about that.  I thought about ordering an appetizer then decided I would just go with an entre.  I had the shrimp scampi-- though the bruschetta looked very appealing.  The scampi was done in a light tomato cream sauce, which I really liked.  Additionally I requested the pasta al dente; it was not quite there, but I Love homemade pasta, and that with the fantastic sauce more than made up for it.  A lot of restaurants make the sauce too oily or often just too thick.  Trattoria's recipe was just right.  Their sauce held on to the pasta without smothering it.  While the shrimp were a little skimpy, they were still flavorful and well prepared, past translucent but not tough.    I would not say it was quite a 4 but close.  I don't understand running out of a product with so few customers."}
{"text":"We love this place so much, that we decided to have our Valentine's dinner here.  I had the same dish as before, because it reminds me of the food my dad used to cook for me.  The pappardelle alla bolognese were delicious as usual.  I started with a Negroni as this was my dad's favorite drink.  Eli makes amazing cocktails.  He is an amazing bartender, he was so sweet to come by and say hello.  This time I started with the beet salad, wow, I love beets and the golden beets were so delicious atop a bed of arugula with a creamy dressing.  My husband had the skirt steak because they did not have the gnudi on the menu anymore, gasp!.  I am sure he will survive.  I had a bite of the steak, it was cooked to perfection.  For dessert we shared the salted caramel cheesecake.  Perfect finish for a perfect meal."}
{"text":"This places ticks all the boxes. Great food, great prices, amazing staff. Try the coppa pizza - you won't be sorry. Happy hour is a great deal... $5 drink specials and a select amount of $7 pizzas. I'll definitely be back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. I live in East Mesa and it is very scarce on great restaurants.  I find myself going to Phoenix or Scottsdale to experience some quality food.  The staff is very pleasant, the food is beyond excellent, the atmosphere is perfect.   I can't wait to take some friends and introduce them to SOLO"}
{"text":"Decided to try it out based on the Yelp reviews and definitely was not disappointed.  Started the meal with the \"house made\" meatballs and they were astounding.  For the main course I had the Vendure.  It is an awesome \"pasta\" dish made with spaghetti squash and I had it topped with the salmon.  I finished it off with Jackie's Tiramisu which made a perfect ending to the meal.  They could use a much better selection at the bar, I had a cabernet sauvignon with dinner and it was okay.  I wanted a good rum but they didn't have any.  I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"We got to try a lot of things because we had a prixe fixe dinner Living Social voucher.  It was AWESOME!  First, its nice to have attentive waitstaff that's attentive as well as knowledgeable about the food.  Always positive, no attitude - we all know this can ruin any meal if you have poor service.  Its also nice when the manager or owner of the establishment seems to care that things are going well.  The place is definitely well run and the food came out at appropriate times.  For appetizers we got the green bean salad and the pork belly.  Both were different enough to be interesting but worked well enough that it wasn't weird.  Portions were decent and there was just the right amount of seasoning on both.   For entrees we got gnocchi and salmon.  Salmon was deliciously cooked with the skin on - I'd forgotten how good just plain salmon can be with just some salt.  The waiter warned me that the gnocchi is thicker than the traditional potato kind which I definitely appreciated.  It was a bit thick, but I'm still glad I got it because the red sauce was one of the best I've had.  It wasn't too thick or thin, too salty, too sweet.  Pretty perfect.  They could have been a tiny bit more sausage but really, its a great dish.  For dessert we chose both of the specials they had that evening - carrot cake and velvet cake with mascarpone gelato.  The carrot cake was different, kind of like moist sponge cake but still very good.  The velvet cake presentation was pretty and you can't go wrong with cake and ice cream.  :)  We will definitely be returning as long as their standards don't change for the worst!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed.... The pictures of the pasta on Yelp drew me in, and I was so excited to give this place a try. My experience was less than positive.   I will preface this review by saying that the two stars come from 1) half price bottles of wine on Wednesdays 2) family owned and operated. That's where the stars stop.   My food was terrible. I ordered a pasta dish that was supposed to be hand cut fresh pasta with pancetta and peas in a light white sauce. What I got was pasta with a terrible creamy tomato sauce, frozen peas, and squares of flat sandwich ham. No joke. I was floored. I asked the waiter if there was supposed to be more pancetta it if I mis read the menu, and he brought me a plate of greasy cold pieces of pancetta that resembled bacon bits.   I stopped him again and sent it back because I don't even buy deli ham to eat in sandwiches, so I definitely don't want it in my pasta. (Just a side note: this wasn't just a little bit. Half of the volume of my dish was deli ham pieces) when I sent it back the waiter's response was that the menu was being updated to say ham, but that it hadn't been done yet. Ok. Fine. But why didn't you mention that to me when I ordered it?   My lover-boo got the margherita pizza and it was also nothing like the pictures on yelp. The pizza in the preview pictures make the pizzas look wood fired and crispy. What we got was squishy doughy pizza with mediocre sauce and barely any flavor.   This makes me wonder if there was a change in chefs.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"My first time dining at Solo last night and I really loved it!  John brought us a very delicious bottle of wine, Tommasa and recommended the squash w bursts for an appetizer- heaven!!!  Dinner was timed nicely and delicious and the afagado and chocoholic lava cake was over the top!  It was a great evening with my honey and we will definitely be going back- hopefully super soon!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all!  We had a groupon and I was really really really looking forward to date night here.  Service seemed really friendly until we took out our groupon.  We were moved into the bar section (this might be our fault as I decided it was to hot to sit outside) and given a different waiter.  The food wasn't good either.  Had some appetizer with an egg and asparagus.  I can't even find it on the menu now to give the name.  It was actually icky and a small portion.  If I was starving when it arrived I wouldn't have even ate it.  Left a taste in my mouth that I didn't like.   Husband tried the flat iron steak.  I didn't think it was good at all.  He is less picky and ate his food happily.  I had some dish that looked like pot roast (also can't find on the menu now).  It was recommended to me by the waiter and I didn't care at all for it.  Very fatty and I could have gotten a better flavor in my crock pot at home.  For dessert we tried the cheese plate.  This was the only redeeming part of the meal.  The goat cheese was delicious and the other items were also yummy.  If not for the cheese plate I would have left crying - it was that bad."}
{"text":"Get your mussels on without getting bulky at this great restaurant in the Esplanade. Just had the mussels - generous serving, great savory broth, plenty of bread for mopping up all the yumminess. Added strength? Superior service and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here out of blue on Friday night, was pleasantly surprised to find live music. What a great treat. Service extremely friendly and meal was very nice. Would return."}
{"text":"We read all of the great reviews, so decided to try this place out for ourselves for dinner.  We ended up showing up for happy hour and took advantage of the amazing options and prices!  The restaurant is comfortable, the staff was friendly and the food was reasonable and tasty.  We shared the meatballs, a salad and a pizza...the cost was so little we felt like we did something wrong.  Definitely check this place out for happy hour...you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Family owned. Serving a nice variety of Arizona wines. The owner had actually visited some of the vineyards and it was fun to compare notes while waiting for freshly prepared food - much of it Locally Sourced.    Tried a lot of things since we had a large group of people madly ordering like it was their last meal before the Famine came!  I personally enjoyed the eggplant. What stood out for me was that their dishes tasted like \"food\" - not salt, not oil, not dried spices.....just the actual food flavor coming through."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic.  We came and didn't know Tuesday or Wednesday, I forgot which day we went, was half price bottles of wine.  Sweet!!!  I got a great bottle for 1/2 off.  Food excellent, my wife had a cocktail and it was made well, and the service was on point.  We sat at the bar, so it is rare you get poor service at the bar, but he was on point.  Great place to chill and have great conversation."}
{"text":"First of all, it's a little hard to find this place since it's in an office park.  You can't see it from the street.  Park in the garage and the restaurant will validate your parking.  But, this place is a MUST try.  Had dinner with my hubby.  This place is amazing.  All their pasta is homemade which is rare since most places use processed, pre-made pasta.  We started off with the bruschetta with burrata, delicious.  The burrata was creamy and fresh and the bread was perfectly toasted and not dry and hard like the typical bruschetta.    As for my entree, I had the gnudi with the braised short rib.  The entire this was tender and melt in your mouth good.  I kept saying \"oh, this is so good\" with every bite.  My husband tried another pasta (forgot the name, never seen this type of pasta before) which he loved.  He asked for bread so he could soak up any remaining sauce.  Just a very fresh tomato sauce.    The desserts were good too.  We had the salted caramel cheesecake and chocolate cake.  If you get the chocolate cake, I recommend getting a scoop of gelato with it.    All in all, the real star is the pasta.  I've been to Italy 4 times and it reminds me of Italy.  I'll be back and my goal is to try every pasta dish."}
{"text":"Tasty food, way overpriced.  Decor:  3.5 out of 5 Service:  3.5 out of 5 (spotty, sometimes great) Food:  3.5 out of 5 Value:  2  Tip:  Order the meatballs appetizer.  Best thing on the menu by far.  I've eaten here 3 times, twice for dinner, once for lunch.  It's family owned, and I feel for the family.  The sons seem to be the waiters, but honestly, they are not as attentive/good as waiters should be.  Empty water glasses are the norm.  The food is good.  It's got reasonable presentation, nice flavors, good textures.  But it's not up to par with their prices.  It's mid-range.    Their appetizer prices are $1-2 higher than they should be.  Their pasta is maybe on par.  Their pizza prices seem relatively reasonable, maybe a $1 high.    But where they really are too expensive are their entrees.  For the quality of the ingredients, and quantity, they are easily each $5-7 too expensive.  So you walk out of here feeling like you had a nice meal, but got gouged.  They complain about the location having too little traffic, and I really feel for this family owned/run business, but the real reason their restaurant is 3/4 empty all the time, if not completely empty, is that they are charging too much.  They are not on par with the restaurants 5 miles around them charging the same prices.  So they rely upon groupons and coupons and other things to generate interest, but they won't get repeat customers at their full prices.  It's sad, but I believe it's true.  Anyway, if you are having dinner at the theater, which is 5 stars all the way (Esplanade 14), then it's not a bad place to go.  But otherwise I wouldn't go out of your way to dine here."}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood find! It is obvious this family owned business takes a great deal of pride in all they do - from the simple elegance of the interior space, to the professional staff and of course, in the excellence of their food.  You won't find a menu 'book' here, limited offerings - read: they concentrate on what they do well and do it well. The field salad was very large, almost entrée-size, and not drowning in dressing. I ventured outside of my box and ordered the roasted acorn squash w/burrata. There was a lot of burrata (Italian cheese made with mozzarella and cream), almost too much, but it was surprisingly good and I would have no qualms ordering it again.   For entrees we went with the flat-iron steak (cooked medium), and the appetizer meatballs. The steak was prepared perfectly! And tender..,and flavorful...and beautifully presented on top of a nest of fingerling potatoes. The appetizer meatballs were just the right amount (TIP: as tempting as it is, don't fill up on the delicious warm artesian bread they bring to the table!!) and delicious as well.  Being a loyal Yelper, I checked in when we arrived. Surprise: a free dessert!! We shared the Tiramisu - what can I say - it was light, heavenly, deliciously flavorful. Probably one of the best Tiramisu's I've had in a long, long, long time.  SOLO is on our list of places to go back to - and often."}
{"text":"We were in town on a business trip.  We were unfamiliar with the area so picked this restaurant based on the reviews.  We made reservations here for around 5pm for a party of 9, plus our baby in a stroller.  It was a Friday night so we wanted to eat early and get ahead of the crowd.  We couldn't have made a better choice.  The service was wonderful and we enjoyed the singer/guitarist that played.  Service and ambiance were great.  The only thing that keeps us from giving it 5 stars is that it was listed as kid friendly, yet there was no place to change our baby's diaper in the restroom.  We had to get creative with that.  We would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"We made advance dinner reservations for Valentine's Day! The restaurant parking was a bit hard to find; we went around a few times before finding the parking space.  We got seated in some nice couch by one corner; the lights were so dim that we had a hard time looking at the menu. But I really liked the fact that it was a bit secluded and quiet.  Roasted acorn squash was our choice for appetizers and I loved it! For the main course, I ordered Pappardelle pasta and I don't quite remember what my husband ordered. Both the dishes were delicious!  We topped off the meal with chocolate lava cake. Food was great. Service was okay at best; the waiter forgot to bring a couple of things we asked for. Overall, a pleasant dining experience in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food was good, but I was slightly let down by the service.  The place is equipped well and a nice relaxed decor, but I felt like we were an inconvenience.  It is walking distance so I would go back, but that is because of the food."}
{"text":"This is a nice Italian Restaurant located across the street from the Biltmore Shopping Center in the Esplanade. You have to park in the parking garage but it's free because the restaurant validates the ticket.   You see lots of paintings for sale filling the walls.   Our waiters were very friendly and gave us outstanding service and they dress extremely  casually. To be honest I thought the dishwasher was waiting on me until he took our order.  We were here for restaurant week so my experience may differ slightly.  Our appetizers were sausage and a full size mushroom, balsamic and arugula pizza. Both were tasty and very large portions.   We shared a mushroom pasta course. The pasta was toothy and the mushroom were cooked well and tasted like they were kissed with wine.  My dinner was the ribeye. It was seasoned nicely and cooked to a perfect medium rare. It came with beans that seemed fresh cooked. The beans were cooked nicely but seemed almost unseasoned.  My husband had a pasta dish with shrimp and Calabrian Chili. Pasta was toothy, shrimp cooked well and this dish was SPICY. Like Thai Food Spicy!  For dessert we shared the cheese course and the lava cake. While it wasn't the best cheese course I've had.....It wasn't bad either. I thought it was nice to offer something for people who don't like sweets. The lava cake was tasty but needed to be served slightly hotter because the filling didn't run.  3.5 stars rounded up for exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Even with a lapse in visits, coming back to Solo for the chichen picattta, and hearing about the latest cheesecake creations from Eli, makes this place all the more special. Rocky Road cheesecake, awesome"}
{"text":"I didn't leave Solo feeling like Jabba the Hut, which is a plus. There were some real highlights to the meal, but the entrees were a mixed bag. The caprese was delicious with a hard and soft (fresh) mozzarella, and three different tomato presentations. Fresh, roasted, and a sweet chutney. Be sure to have the bread served with this appetizer, or else it's not very substantial. For entrees, we had a pasta dish in pink sauce with peas and mushrooms. (We opted for no ham.) The sauce was tasty, but the homemade pasta was very thin and didn't hold the sauce well. We also had a chicken dish with a vegetable and bean ragout. The ragout was outstanding, with the beans somehow almost giving the dish a texture of home fries. The chicken, however, was dry and bland. The cappuccino and tiramisu were both excellent, although the tiramisu was a little heavy on the moscarpone. Live music. Great service. A little pricey. I wish there was a 3.5 star option. I want to return to try the pizza, but I think I'll avoid the entrees."}
{"text":"We received a gift certificate from friends to celebrate our engagement here, so it was a great way to explore a new place.  I'd definitely go back!!   We started with the meatballs - they were so tender and fresh, a great appetizer to kick off the meal.   Definitely recommend trying these!   We shared the Papardelle pasta dish.  Fresh pasta made in-house with flavorful sauce. It was good, and perfect if you are looking for a more traditional pasta dish, but next time I'll experiment with other pasta options.  We then shared the Prosciutto and Fig pizza....  AMAZING!!   Definitely the highlight of our meal.  It was perfect and so tasty, a great combination of being lightly sweet and salty, with just the right amount and flavor of cheese, topped by some fresh arugula and parmigiano.   I also had the cocktail called The Bicycle Thief - not sure about the name, but it was tasty.  Not too sweet, not too dry.  Loved it!    We wrapped up our dinner with a caramel apple cheesecake - not on the menu - and it was delightful.  I'm not always a big cheesecake fan, but this had apple slices on top, drizzled with caramel... mmmmm!!      Great, friendly, attentive and informative service.  Waitress was awesome, gave good recommendations.   The dinner was a hit!   Enjoyed ourselves immensely, look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.. the server was very friendly and the owner stopped by our table several times to see how we liked the meal. The risotto is amazing!!"}
{"text":"We were hungry for Italian food, did not know where to go so of course checked out Yelp for help.  Before landing at Solo Trattoria, we first chose to go to a place that rhymes with \"Mistos.\" We get to \"Misto's\" and it is a mad house, loud, with people everywhere and it kinda smelled like my Grandmothers house, and not in a good way.  We are told it would be close to a 2 hour wait for a table for two, but sitting at the bar would be quicker.  We agreed, but quickly changed our minds when we realized everyone at the bar were working on their salad course.  I was not about to stand around and wait, especially as the smell of the restaurant was making me kinda sick.  We checked Yelp again and headed to Solo Trattoria.    Solo Trattoria is well hidden in the Esplanade Center off Camelback and 25th Street.  Parking is plentiful in the garage but be prepared to pay to park.  I did overhear our server tell another table that the restaurant validates parking, but of course, I left my ticket in the car and did not want to walk back to get it.    Once we found the restaurant, we were pleased.  It is beautiful.  We were greeted and after some confusion on where to seat us, we were seated in the main dining room.    After looking at the menu, we asked to start with the meatball starter ($9) as It was recommended by our server.  The meatballs were five star for sure, 3 big meatballs in a fantastic tomato sauce.  I probably could have ordered two servings of those and called it dinner.  We also ordered a couple of Sangrias ($8ea) and then our main courses, chicken piccata ($20) and chicken marsala ($22)  If I had a complaint was the pasta was a bit too al dente, but it is made fresh and sometimes fresh pasta can taste this way.  Speaking of fresh, the owner stopped by our table to let us know that everything in the restaurant was made from scratch except for the bread as that is brought in from a local bakery.    So, we do want to return and definitely get the meatballs again.  I also would like to try the pizza as they looked incredible.   One final note, the music that was played might not have been a great fit, unless of course, you are a fan of AC/DC \"Back in Black\".  Don't get me wrong, I was a mega fan of AC/DC circa 1980, but lets fast forward 34 years and play something more relevant."}
{"text":"At the time of our visit, SOLO Trattoria has barely been open 6 months. It is located in an upscale business complex of beautiful, tall buildings and surrounded by high end hotels and condos and other restaurants. The restaurant is a bit tricky to find, but if you let GPS do its job and you park your car in the parking structure behind the buildings, you will find a map near the elevator to steer you to their location inside the complex.  The restaurant will validate your ticket.  This family-owned trattoria has a nice history of restaurant experience in the Chicago area. A charming, intimate venue, the menu is small and developed with seasonal considerations. The servings are on the small side too, but are intended to be like tapas, satisfying without feeling overstuffed.    A very talented chef, Chef Craig apparently is a guy who loves to play with his food. He creates great complex sauces, has beautiful platings, works with local ingredients, and devotes a lot of time to making his dishes unique and from scratch.  The restaurant owners, chef, our very professional server, Debbie, and the remainder of staff were all helpful and friendly, a welcoming vibe with great possibilities.  We were encouraged to let the chef show off by going with his tasting menu. An excellent deal, you make a choice of either 3, 4 or 5 courses.  We decided on a 4 course dinner @ $40 pp (that means $10 each course). Since there were two of us, this meant we got to share 8 different dishes, no duplications.  Mr. B also went with the wine pairing option.  He was given 4 glasses of wine, each selected for his 4 platings, a decent pour with each, for an additional $20.  The Chef's Tasting played out like this.  Antipasti: -Crisp Pork Belly on white beans and a hummus smear. Simple, tender, the three slices of belly were delicious and left me wanting more. Wine pairing- a Verdicchio that hinted of a Malvasia. -Butternut Squash Soup topped with roasted pumpkin seeds and saba (a sweet syrup made from grape must). Complex flavors (unlike a very boring version I had the day before), my only complaint was it was slightly overly salted. It really was a lovely soup.   Pasta: -Malloreddus (a Sardinian Gnocchi made with semolina) -This had a pomodoro sauce with a judicious amount of Schreiner's Italian sausage, topped with arugula and pecorino. I loved the sauce. So, so rich, the sausage ingredient was also perfect.  While not a fan of this gnocchi, my main complaint was again the degree of salt. Wine pairing - a Rose. -Spaghetti alla Chitarra - a thick spaghetti noodle tossed in a white sauce that was seasoned with white pepper and Grana Padana. Simply loved it.  Entree: -Braised Beef on a creamy risotto. A good dish, slow cooked to tenderness. Wish it were less lean, but that is a personal preference. Wine pairing - a Cabernet. -Salmon on fennel lentils and seared Brussel sprouts. The salmon was served with a crispy skin and simply salted. Usually not into salmon skin, I was hooked this time. The salmon was perfectly cooked and was fresh tasting. The brussel sprouts, slightly too salty.  Dessert:  -Oatmeal Stout Panna Cotta. This was presented over a cranberry jam, then a house made Granola sprinkled on top. Good. Wine pairing - Lambrusco. -Pumpkin Budino with whipped cream and a caramel bourbon sauce drizzle. A delicate spiced pudding cake, not unlike a soufflé. Yum. A nice ending.   I find it particularly amusing that I would be passing on this word of advice  considering I am one who loves a good salty snack and will reach for the salt shaker frequently. My advice would be to request the chef go more lightly on the  salt whenever possible. While far from unpalatable, his dishes could have been so much more satisfying if the diner could decide on the final salting at their table.  All in all, a nice romantic meal, but with minor set backs that are so easy to fix. It was auspicious to be introduced via Groupon. I made reservations using Open Table (got 1,000 points, folks), got an additional free dessert (they even made it to-go) by doing a Yelp check-in, and free parking. Good deal.  4.5 stars !  Post script: A day later, I dug into my take-home prize, the tiramisu (my free Yelp check-in dessert). There are many versions of tiramisu, and this one is one of the best, no cutting corners. Layers of a soaked light cake, mascapone, and deep rich espresso and coffee liquor flavors, but then, I am guessing. I am still regretting that I had to share it. Molto bene! Yes, Yelp friends, this is a must try!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at the SOLO trattoria on the six month anniversary of their opening. This little place was sparkling clean. The service was impeccable. The food was fresh tasting and delicious. I couldn't ask for more. This is a family owned place and it shows."}
{"text":"I chose this establishment for dinner in part due to the great Yelp reviews and the proximity to my hotel.  When I arrived around 5:45 on a Tuesday evening, the place was pretty empty and I chose to sit in a booth.  It was a little dim but furnished in a classy manner with nice artwork on the walls.    I am a huge beet fan so I started out with the beet salad which was delicious.  The golden beets were luscious and the arugula was smothered with goat cheese which gave it a nice, creamy texture.  There were some accompanying walnuts which added nice crunch but I could not taste any trace of the orange vinaigrette dressing.    Some bread was provided as well which unfortunately was too dry for my taste.  A let down after being delighted by the beets.  I opted for the pappardelle which was quite tasty.  The potion was good sized and the home made pasta was cooked el dente.  The marinara sauce was a nice mixture of sweet and savory and the diced carrots added some contrasting texture.  I \"checked in\" via Yelp and got a free dessert and chose the chocolate lava cake.  Although it was free, the cake was very disappointing as the cake was not heated enough (merely lukewarm) and did not ooze the hot lava chocolate that I was anticipating.  The ice cream was too light and tasted more of whipped cream than ice cream.  It was good enough to finish, but probably the most disappointing chocolate lava cake that I ever had.  Service was decent and good value costing ~ $48."}
{"text":"My inamorata and I were in town for a business trip a couple weeks back and were lucky enough to find this gem while taking a stroll down Camelback to explore what Phoenix had to offer.  We were so pleased with the fig jam and prosciutto pizza, the personalized service and ambiance that we decided to come back for the chef's tasting menu on day two of our visit.    We went all in and had a ten (10) course tasting menu (call ahead).  Staff took the time to explain the dishes, often the sourcing and of course the seasonality. Chef Degel often has a whimsical approach to his dishes. You will find little wink's in his pasta creations and specials. Some of highlights included  A mortadella agnolotti pasta is an analog to childhood favorite bologna and cheese while the English Pea Cappelletti en Brodo is essentially an Italian Wonton soup. The salmon crudo (raw salmon, strawberries, jalepeno and advocado) was refreshing while still taking the palette on a little journey of taste and texture. My partner had a crush on the Berry Soup and Oatmeal Stout panna cotta (it seems these are in house treats and not farmed out) for dessert. If you have the time and appetite take a run at the Chefs tasting menu ...you won't be left wanting.  Solo's setting is a step up and fit for a special occasion or date, the staff willing and knowledgeable the food satisfying and playful. Solo is a bit hidden in its corridor off Camelback Rd and lacks an obvious street view but is truly a gem worth searching for.   We will be back on next visit to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Service was exceptionally rude and I still feel sick from the shrimp scampi. They don't give bread unless you ask for it, which seems kind of stingy. The bathrooms weren't clean so I decided to wait and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the positive reviews.  We were there on Thursday for lunch and were the only ones in the restaurant.  The pizza was ok but the dough lacked an appealing texture and the sauce was a tad pasty.  This does not compare to Pomo for example.    Next went to the pasta.  I had the Bolognese and while it wasn't bad, the meat was definitely an American version of a real Bolognese blend.  The papparadelle a pomodoro was average at best.  Again the sauce lacked finesse.  Unfortunately, I must say the same for the tiramisu.  We have had such good tirami su of late at Andreoli, Pomo and Trattoria Veneto.  The tiramisu here simply lacked flavor.  This is really just an American version of an Italian restaurant trying to be chic but lacking talent in the kitchen to pull it off."}
{"text":"It's a tough 1st impression when one feels like they're wandering in no man's land just to find the front door.  That said, when we finally found it, it was a little surprising at how small and quaint the location is, as most things in Scottsdale are very bold and in your face.  We were seated, and started with the pork belly and burrata mozzarella.  Pork belly is very fatty - and I'm never prepared for it - so it always catches me off guard.  But it was nice with the lentils.  The fresh mozzarella was really good with the tomatoes.  For the entree, Angie got the salmon and I got the flatiron.  The salmon was on a nice orzo salad and really felt like a complete meal.  The skirt steak was more of a de-constructed steak salad.  The arugula with parmesan was good, and the steak was seasoned nicely, but the meal just left me wanting more if that makes sense.  Maybe a starch would help complete the dish, but as is I wouldn't consider it an entree.  The desserts were just ok, I had the gelato trio and the pistachio one was tasty but the rest were just forgettable.  I suppose when one sees an average rating of 4.5 you have certain expectations - and it just didn't do it for me.  The service was okay, but there are so many choices in Scottsdale, I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great family atmosphere, food was excellent,  loved the chicken pacatta and risotto with fennel.  Free desert off yelp was a big bonus."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and I was pleasantly surprised by how good the meal was.    As the first course, we ordered the farm salad and the simple salad.    I definitely enjoyed my salad with the creamy dressing and the cheese and other items, although I must admit, for my taste, they could use less of the dressing.   It overpowers the salad.   Next time I will order it on the side.   My mate's salad was more on the plain side with balsamic vinegar, and it was great, but a dressing I could enjoy at home.  For the main course we ordered the flat iron steak with fingerlings and grilled veggies.    Just the right texture and flavoring.    I am sorry I didn't learn what was in the sauce for the flat iron so I could duplicate.    For dessert we ordered the pumpkin budino and red velvet cake.   Oh, my goodness!   I was stuffed, but had to finish what I ordered, which was the pumpkin budino.    My mate absolutely loved the red velvet cake, which comes with ice cream.    Our server was Elijah.    Very personable and efficient.   I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is Phoenix's best kept secret. If you like Italian food made to perfection - COME HERE. Our server - Drew Manning - is the most attentive, patient & helpful one around, but everyone here is polite & warm. I can't wait until the next time I have some eggplant parm & tiramisu. Literally drooling. Casual, low key, big TVs, great music, authentic Italian. Bar. Nothing crazy. Dim lights. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We had the antipasti homemade meatballs, chicken marsala w/homemade pasta, tiramisu, & espresso which was amazing. Service was excellent. Definitely one of my faves."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza! So fresh and full of flavor! Highly recommend this charming little spot for fantastic Italian fare. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Meh. The food is okay, not great, not bad. The front of the house was a mess and needs some serious attention to training. Our server came by for a drink order, listed 3 beers on special, and when we asked what type of beer one of the specials was, the response was, \"I don't know\".... not, I'll go find out, just \"I don't know.\" Later when ordering entrees we asked about a pasta dish, and the explanation from the server was literally, to read the description off of the menu over my shoulder. The homemade pasta was tasty, but stuck together too much. I'd rather go to The Parlor or Mr. Bianco's new \"Italian Restaurant\" any day. This place has to fix the totally unenthusiastic front of the house for any hope of making it."}
{"text":"Truly, I should be banned from this place.  I mean, I have been there four times, each time smugly presenting a very nice Living Social or Local Dines or Deal Chicken voucher that cuts my bill in half.  Each time, and not ONCE have they rolled their eyes back, and made me feel guilty.  In fact, the service is great, the manager (I suspect, the owner tonite) checked with us politely a few times during our meal. And every time there (including last nite), the food has beed solid!  Thx for making it affordable for my frequent visits, Solo.  You are very gracious and I think the dough in your pizza is heavenly.  AND my kids like your place, too!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"We ended up here by accident, but this is a place we will definitely come back to. Our Groupon said reservations required but we were able to get one last minute on a Saturday evening, so no worries there. The setting was quiet and intimate, with a live singer who was great to listen to.  The food was fantastic. The meat and cheese appetizer featured local cuts and cheeses and everything went together perfectly. Pizza was crusty and the toppings all went well together. I had a ham and fig pizza and it was the perfect blend of sweet and salty. Hubby had a spicy meat pizza that he said was good as well. Desserts were a good size (not too huge) but rich enough to make up for it.  Service was fast and friendly and they were very accommodating in letting us use a Groupon AND the check-in bonus for a free dessert (don't worry, we tipped nicely). Avoid the parking fees in that area by leaving your car in the free parking area at the mall and walk over. Unless it is June, in which case pay the parking fees and avoid showing up sweating like a pig. I think the restaurant might validate parking stickers to get you a discount. Overall, this is a great place for a quiet, semi-casual date night or dinner with a friend."}
{"text":"solid choice near biltmore hotel.  service and food were both good.  when i am in the area again i will be back."}
{"text":"Service great, pizza great. Live music-score!  Excellent wine and beer choices.   We got the coppa pizza which was to die for. For an appetizer we got the pork belly which I was hesitant on at first but was DELICIOUS.   Come here for a cute date or friends and family. Great atmosphere.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Solo is a great place, the food is delicious, beautify and even better fresh and local.  Everything was had was excellent.  I especially loved the green bean peach salad.  Service was also very good.  Atmosphere relaxed yet special."}
{"text":"Oh how being a foodie in Missouri is such a very apparent bummer. Especially when I find places like this delectable find. (Thanks to Yelp)  I'd like to first say that we were walk in's and they had a huge party that filled the dining room. Did that effect the service or the quality of food? Not this place.  Food, from the pork belly app to the homemade pasta and home made biscotti were perfect. Waiter was super knowledgable and polite. Service was great.   Terrific experience."}
{"text":"We tried this place with a GroupOn so that made it affordable. For the quality of the food (at least what we had), I wouldn't have wanted to pay full price. It was ok but not great. Service was excellent though and I appreciate the attempt at ambiance with eclectic art on the walls and live music. Music was a bit too loud, however, for me and my fellow diners to comfortably hold a conversation."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I look forward to going back, and ordering something else to have a higher opinion.  BUT... our visit didn't live up to the hype.  The good part, I used a living social deal, they were very nice about it, it saved a ton.  The dish my Husband ordered was amazing, the pappardelle.  The meatballs as an appetizer were also amazing.  It really tasted like home cooked for hours made with love Italian.  The service was nice and very fast.  The bad, my dish, the risotto... The rice was not cooked all the way, so it was very chalky.  The featured one had artichokes, and when I heard my heart jumped for joy because I LOVE artichokes, and I assumed they would use fresh, but they didn't, they used canned/jarred.  It ruined the risotto, I couldn't taste anything else, the cheese and really amazing pancetta were drowned out.  The tiramisu was also not very enjoyable.  The sambuca and lemoncello were out of this world though :)"}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday night dinner and had a great meal! One of the appetizer specials for the day was ravioli, which were so good. Also loved the chicken piccata and tiramisu. The only quibble I have is that there was a bit of a wait, even with a reservation, and the decor was a mix of random paintings of varying quality."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a good sit down Italian restaurant for about 20 years. I've finally found it. Great service (wish I could remember her name)...Owner's son came and talked with us, as did one of the owners (wife). The food was just as good as the service. The wine list is good. The beer list is good. We absolutely loved this place and can't wait to go back. It is also cool that it seems everyone there seems to really enjoy working there. We had the Caprese salad, meatballs, a pasta with braised beef, and and the limoncello chicken pasta. All four were outstanding. 5 stars without question."}
{"text":"Great family owned spot! Good service, good food! Great location before a movie."}
{"text":"Went here with my daughter and used a Groupon that I had purchased. We went right at 5:00 and sat out on the patio. I liked the atmosphere and the Long Island Iced tea I ordered was pretty good. (For those of you that know me - I am very picky about my LIT!) I am not going to be able to give you the exact names of what we ate since the menu online is not the same menu that we had but I will try and remember what I can! We started off with an appetizer made of acorn squash and it was amazing! That and the dessert were both of our favorites. For our entrees we ordered the Salsiccia sausage pizza (with goat cheese added) and an entree made of ricotta dumplings and braised beef (Gnudi?). Both were pretty good. The desserts again were amazing. Our favorite was the Pumpkin Budino. Absolutely delicious! I was also very impressed with our server because he was spot on with all of his recommendations!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. All the pasta except the spaghetti is made on premise.   We had a party of 18 and everyone we happy.  The bar area is small but is very classy and comfy. They have 3 large tvs."}
{"text":"Great little family Italian restaurant. We tried the restaurant based on Groupon deal for a 3 course meal for two.    Had the bruschetta appetizer, it was good but a little too sweet with some type of Red Pepper Jam. Not my thing but the wife liked it.   Entrees were excellent. We had the Shrimp with a spicy cream sauce and the Wild Mushroom Risotto with a fried egg on top. Both were worth the trip across town.    Finished with the Tiramisu.  Just OK.   Afterwards, we head upstairs and see a movie at the AMC theater. Seating is amazing."}
{"text":"Enjoyable meal.  The meatballs were really good.  The gnocci was good but nothing too special.  Definitely tastes like quality ingredients are used here."}
{"text":"This is such a great spot for a delicious Italian meal and crisp cocktail! Our server, Trevor, was super knowledgable about the menu and gave us outstanding suggestions! The cappers trio is a great way to start! We went with the Pappardelle, the Maltagliati, and the Verdure with Salmon. Everything was delicious and this pasta is outstanding! Definitely check this place out. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Although this place offers quite a variety of meals to choose from the best part about eating here was the happy hour specials. Located on the main drag in town this place would be good to grab a meal and catch a movie. Food was ok nothing that would lure me back in to dine."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place.  When we got there, the ambiance was nice, but it was not welcoming and warm.  We tried the meatballs, which were good.  Then we tried one of their handmade pastas - I don't remember the name, but I did not like it at all.  I was extremely disappointed and don't plan to come back."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time here. My mother and I were looking over the menu outside and a woman came out to talk to us and see if we had questions about the menu. She was very friendly. We decided to eat on the patio and had an absolutely delicious beet salad with arugula and salmon. I highly recommend this dish. The service was prompt and friendly. I would absolute recommend this place."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place.... Family owned, outrageously good food, an ever changing menu that keeps it interesting and really genuine friendly staff.  Best risotto in town!"}
{"text":"This was a hidden found gift. Between the phenomenal risotto app to the delicious pizza with fig jam and affordable yet delicious Zinfandel - what a find."}
{"text":"Based on the great yelp reviews and food photos, my husband n I finally go to try this restaurant.  It is a bit of hidden from Main Street n it seems like doesn't have parking area.  You will have to park in the opposite side of the street which is two hour free parking n was across by the underground.   The atmosphere and service are good which I would probably rate 4 star, however, the food is only decent.   The appetizer is crabcake which tastes rele like microwave food.  For the main course, we order the ribeye steak and shrimp scampi pasta. It is pitiful that they have changed the menu which means I can't find the food from many of the yelp photos. Luckily the steak and pasta are all good.  I like the steak how they cook for medium, crispy outside and juicy inside.  The only con I can think of the pasta is very small portion but it tastes great.  We order the tiramisu afterwards, I don't rele like it.  I can still feel the sand taste of sugar which doesn't blend well."}
{"text":"Casual comfortable.  Had excellent smoked duck pizza as part of restaurant week meal which was incredible deal.  $45 for 3 courses and 50% of wine.  Wonderful experience."}
{"text":"This is a hard one.  I went with 3 other people, and based on their takes- I'd  have to give it a 3 star review.  However, for me it was a 4 star- and this review is MY opinion, right?  We decided to try SOLO for the first time during Restaurant Week after looking up their menus and reviews and both looking good.  Sweet Pea and I got there before our dining companions and were quickly seated without issue.  The person who seated us said that they were featuring a couple of wines, and after he readily offered a taste (which we really liked), we decided to go with the Italian red.  I know this is a family run restaurant, and he appeared to be one of the sons and also in charge of the wine program.  He seemed pretty knowledgeable and the wine was excellent.  Oh- and wine by the bottle was 1/2 price for Restaurant Week.  What a nice touch- we ordered 2.  Our server came to the table right away, and we were soon presented with some bread and olive oil, which I passed on but Sweet Pea partook of.  He didn't say anything about it either way, so I'll assume it was adequate.  Once our companions arrived and the server went over the Restaurant Week menu, I was a little sad to see that the pizza featured on the menu had meat on it.  I mentioned this to our waitress, and she went back to the kitchen to talk options.  She came back with several vegetarian alternatives that weren't on the Restaurant Week menu, and she said they could do the Margherita pizza as well.  I was sold on that, as well as on the beet salad. I love beets.  I told Sweet Pea that I'd read on Yelp that the meatballs are excellent, and he ordered those.  He and another dining companion ordered the gnudi as well.  I loved my beet salad.  Great arugula, great goat cheese, really great chunks of beets, and great dressing.  In fact, I offered it around the table, and it was a big hit with everyone.  The meatballs were also a big hit.  Sweet Pea says they are excellent.  My pizza was also very good and quite large.  Unfortunately there was a bit of a timing issue where I and another one of us were served, and it was a good 5 minutes before everyone else's came, and since we waited- it was cold.  It would have been better hot of course.  People rave about the crust and it was good, I'd order it again, but to me it doesn't compare with my beloved Cibo, or Bianco, or Pomo.  Unfortunately, Sweet Pea and the other diner who ordered the gnudi didn't like it at all due to the sauce.  It was described as a \"horseradish gremolta\", but both of them commented that it had an odd and not good taste.  On the recommendation of the server, I tried a dessert that came with a scoop of vanilla gelato, a house made biscotti, and a shot of espresso.  It was delicious, all of it- even the biscotti, and I am NOT a biscotti fan.  The other diners enjoyed the turtle cheesecake, but I can't comment on that as I am not a cheesecake fan.  One comment on the service- everyone was friendly, but it could have been more even.   As I already said, the guy who sat us and recommended the wine was really friendly and knowledgeable.  The server was very friendly and willing to go the extra step for me as a vegetarian, which was nice.  Someone else, I'm assuming an owner, came by to ask how our meal was.  Very nice touch.  It's the pacing that was an issue.  At the beginning of the meal, our server came by expectantly as we'd just sat down asking if we were ready to order, which felt very rushed.  I asked her to come back, and she gave it a good amount of time before she came back, which was good.  Somewhere after that, things fell apart a bit.  As I've said already, the timing of the food coming out was a bit problematic.  The clearing (or lack thereof) was also problematic.  They brought our entees when our first courses weren't cleared, and so they had to sit them next to eachother on an already-crowded table, which was awkward.  There were a lot of long awkward pauses in the flow of the meal.  If SOLO can even all of that out, it would make it that much greater of an experience.  Overall, I really liked it, my companions liked a lot of it, and we'll all be back."}
{"text":"This place is definitely unique in its cuisine and the plates and menu AR one of a kind. Sometimes and doesn't suit my palate but that doesn't mean it wouldn't suit on someone else's. The decor is so so it could use an update or more color perhaps a splash of color or something but it is slightly plain. Still the food is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, friendly family atmosphere, food that rocks your taste buds, and great live music...what's not to love?? Drew, Jon, Jackie, and Eli are the best folks in the business."}
{"text":"I was in town for a business meeting and looked on yelp for a good place to eat, Solo did not disappoint! Great service and delicious beers as well as a yummy pizza! My co worker and I split a cheese and meat appetizer which was also very tasty! It's a family business and we even got to talk to them, very nice and helpful! Recommended highly!"}
{"text":"First visit - lunch today before movie. Was delightful surprised to discover friendly, caring service, excellent value priced food and great affordable wines by the glass!  This will become the first of many returns to Solo Trattoria!"}
{"text":"Went with my two daughters for dinner.  Actually found it by searching Yelp and it was so good!  It was not crowded so we were a little skeptical but no need to be the service was great, the staff friendly and very knowledgeable about the meals.  And the food tasted great, including dessert!  Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Sitting for 45+ mins waiting for dinner. No server stopping by to check in or grab salad plates. Hmmmmm, sometimes I worry that LivingSocial deals are synonymous with management not doing their job.   Addendum:  Both of the entrees were VERY good. No complaints on the food - just mediocre service."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great restaurant....well be back when I come back to Arizona for business...."}
{"text":"One word...AMAZING! Saw photos of the food and it actually tastes better than it looks! When does that ever happen? The ambiance is romantic and the owners are the sweetest!  Staff and service are excellent! Got the meatball app, acorn squash and mozzarella app and both were so good. Veggies were fresh and red sauce was super yum. Pastas are all made in house so the gnocchi and beef was delicious. The salmon was seasoned and seared to perfection, with lentils, brussel sprouts and sauce were the perfect combo.  If you're looking for fabulous Italian food, you definitely have to try this place!"}
{"text":"Based on all of the great Yelp reviews, SOLO has been on our list for awhile. We're all about visiting family-owned restaurants. The pictures look good, but I think our expectations were just too high going in.  SOLO is tucked away in the Camelback Esplanade complex, an area that seemed kind of dark and dead on a Saturday night. There were plenty of patrons within the restaurant, however, which has both patio and indoor seating. The décor is a combination of both traditional and modern, with walls scattered with artwork that's also for sale (a la Barrio café).  We love burrata and saw some pictures of some burrata bruschetta. They were offering an acorn squash bruschetta that included burrata. The cheese was okay, although isn't burrata supposed to be creamy? The puree squash spread just didn't really do it for us. Maybe we just made a poor choice for our tastes, but it just reminded me too much of baby food. There's a picture on the website (and on Yelp) of some creamy burrata bruschetta which I'm guessing is probably much better.  Their housemade bread was the best part of the meal - and I'm not entirely sure that's a good thing. Freshly baked with a nice crispy outer layer, while still managing to be soft and flavorful on the inside.   We ordered a pappardelle pasta. As another reviewer noted, there's nothing wrong with the pasta itself. But the sauce is void of any flavor, which really puts a damper on its potential. We actually had to add salt, which should be the absolute last thing you should ever had to do to liven up a pasta.  For pizza, we opted for the ham and fig pizza, which also includes prosciutto. The ingredients were acceptable, but the crust was pretty bland and didn't really offer up any flavor pop. Having regularly dined at many of the popular pizzerias in the area, I guess we're just too damned spoiled.  They do offer a free dessert for Yelp check-in. We chose the lava cake, which was just okay. We would have ordered the affagato, but their presentation didn't quite look as exciting as some of the variations we've had at other places in town.  The service was okay and the place has a pretty calm and relaxing atmosphere, so I will give them a bit of credit for that. But with so many other options available that are within miles of this place, we didn't really feel it lived up to the hype.    Many people seem to like it, so they must be doing something right. But ultimately, it just wasn't for us, I guess."}
{"text":"Excellent service and fantastic food. A little hard to find but once there, I did not mind. I was in the mood for good Italian and was out of town so I called on yelp for help!  Yelp led me here and my expectations were exceeded be far. We were treated like family with phenomenal hospitality and all of our meals were nothing delicious. No doubt would I eat here often if I lived nearby."}
{"text":"Had a travel zoo voucher -25 for 50 dollars worth of food. I ordered the meatball appetizer and shrimp scampi. The other person got the chicken Marsala. The shrimp scampi had great noodles and was a little spicy. The portion size was on the small side. The shrimp was good. The chicken Marsala was just okay. The flavor was exactly the same as the chicken ramen noodles. The chicken was  just okay. Didn't have a lot of flavor. Got the tiramisu and that was delicious?"}
{"text":"Very cool place. I absolutely enjoyed everything about this place, from the salad to the service I received. I actually bought a $20 groupon that was worth $40. I ordered a simple salad, a margherita pizza, and a flat iron steak that comes with potatoes and mushrooms. Excellent choices! The ingredients were fresh and made the plates very savory. I would recommend this place for anyone. Absolutely fantastic! And to top it off, when you check in with yelp, you even get a free dessert. I was a little disappointed that they ran out of tiramisu, but was able to order three flavors of gelato which was pretty good. 5 out 5!"}
{"text":"A little pricier than we had planned, but that was our fault, and the food brought up the star level.  First of all, we had been at the movies all afternoon, so got in the car and fired up Yelp! on our phones to see where in the area (Glendale) we would like to try.  This place came up with great reviews.  So we started out, had difficulty finding it with Siri, and it ended up that the restaurant was on the street level under the theatres we had just been to!  It's hidden in a huge office complex called the Esplanade, so when we caught a peek of the front door between buildings, we turned in.  Turned out we were in the wrong parking lot the second time and had to use stairs which were also hard to find--every time we went to one, it directed us to go to another east or west staircase, and none of them were labeled.  We finally got there, and they did validate the parking, so it was free anyway, but a little frustrating to maneuver our way around this complicated complex.  We had a reservation on Open Table which I tried to change when we saw we were going to be late, but we were unable to do that, so we forged ahead and just arrived ten minutes late.  We were greeted and seated immediately, and Debbie was a congenial and efficient server the rest of the night.  Wednesday is 1/2 price wine bottle night, so we took advantage of that and ordered a bottle of pinot grigio for a very reasonable restaurant price.  I had read about their famous meatballs, so I ordered that for a starter (we had skipped lunch) and my wife ordered her favorite Caprese salad.  Both were outstanding.  The marinara sauce on the meatballs tasted as if it had been simmering all day--exactly the taste I had been wanting for years.  I then ordered the shrimp scampi, which promised six jumbo shrimp on the menu, but there were only 5 and they were a little smaller than I expected, but delicious with the spicy cream sauce.  My wife had chicken piccata, which she usually orders, and said it was not as good as others she had ordered in the past.  Overall, a frustrating beginning to an evening with a very pleasant ending"}
{"text":"The BF and I were craving Italian food, and came across a Living Social deal that seemed to good to not try out.  Lucky for us, it was an even better experience than we could imagine!  With the deal, we were awarded 1 appetizer, 2 entree's, 1 dessert and 2 after cocktail drinks for less than $50.  The food and service was so outstanding, that we are already planning our next trip over.  To start, our waiter, Drew, was the real deal.  He was super friendly, had great recommendations, and was incredibly knowledgeable about the food/drinks.  His service was top-notch, and made the evening that more special.  With that, we started with the acorn and burrata app (amazing), moved to the gnudi (ricotta dumplings) and maltagliata (homemade cut pasta in tomato cream sauce) - both outstanding - for dinner, then had tiramisu and homemade limoncello (a must try) to bring it to a close.  We would 100% order all of these items again.  And the biggest surprise, was I asked for a cup of coffee to sip on at the end of the meal.  This, by far, was the best cup of coffee I've had in town.  Ever.  It was their Americano, and apparently they buy their beans from a specialty European shop in Tempe.  I would go there again just to have another cup, it was seriously that good.  All in all, and amazing experience at SOLO Trattoria, and we cannot wait to go back and try more of their spectacular food!"}
{"text":"We went here for our friends 50th birthday and John prepared the perfect four course  wine and dinner pairings. Our first course was minestrone soup, next we had three different Parana cheese course,then four distinct pastas, then he prepared one of the best Risottos and buttery salmon dishes we tasted. Then the best part about f the dinner was the chocolate lava cakes and banana fosters. We can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"I had my birthday dinner here at SOLO Trattoria and I had am amazing time! All of the staff here were so nice and accommodating!! I found them through great reviews on Yelp and I was trying to find a place that would accept all 20 of my guests. It is located in the Esplanade and the surrounding area was pretty quiet since it was amongst closed office buildings. They willingly accepted our party and were really nice when I unexpectedly asked to move our tables.   I had their gnocchi which was shaped cutely and tasted great and all of my guests seemed to enjoy their food as well! What I particularly like, and what is explained on their video, is that their pasta portions are given so they feed one person, not 5 like other restaurants, so you don't feel as guilty eating the whole thing! People that ordered pizza were able to share them and still be satisfied. Their dessert was also really good! I had their special sweet potato cheesecake with a cookie crust and marshmallow bruleed on the top which was not only unique, but was really good!   All the staff were really nice and this is just an amazing family owned restaurant using the freshest ingredients. Our hostess and bar tender were also the pastry chefs. My waiter was such a sweet heart who just wanted me to have a good time and gave me a hug at the end! All of my guests really enjoyed it here and it is safe to say I will be coming back several times in the future!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the non-potato \"gnocchi.\" It wasn't really gnocchi, since it wasn't made with potato. But it satisfied my gnocchi craving nonetheless."}
{"text":"Right from the start it was a great experience. We had top of the line service. Our sever was very helpful giving us different samples of their beers and wines for us to decide what we wanted. The bruschetta was delightful, goat cheese and figs was the choice for the night. We ordered a pizza that was cooked just right. For dessert we had the chocolate lava cake with white cream. When I tell you it melts in your mouth, it literally does! So good! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Did dinner here. Location is geared towards the daytime crowd so we were able to be seated right away.  That's usually not a good sign, but it worked out to our benefit.  I had the ham and fig pizza, my friend had the simple salad and my other friend had a pasta dish that starts with an M.  We were all extremely pleased with our meals, the flavor was rich in each dish.  We were well taken care of - not too much and not too little (thanks Travis). If I lived local, I would frequent this place on a regular basis and try everything on their menu. Prices were very reasonable for what we ordered and how good it tasted."}
{"text":"I was there for a work dinner last night and while the service was great, the food was beyond horrible.  The only thing that was good was the caprese salad.  I was sick all night from what I ate.  Several of my peers sent back their food or barely ate.  Kind of a bummer.  Was expecting an amazing dinner based on the reviews."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend. The interior was small and pretty dark (intimate?) inside.  I was impressed with the service. The servers were knowledgeable and friendly. They helped in our selection of both food and wine.  I had the chicken piccata.  Tried to order it with bow tie or penne pasta but were told they did not have any.  It had a good flavor.  The taste wasn't overpowering, but far from bland.  I was happy with my choice.  My friend had the chicken marsala which was tasty as well.  For dessert was the tiramisu. Best part of the meal! Next time I hope to try their HH since the prices and menu looked good."}
{"text":"Sad. Chefs board with 2 pieces of dried cheese. Risotto ok, pasta and meatball disappointing all tasting like food court food. Wine mediocre cheesecake dry. Aside from the bartender service was poor. Sorry you won't make it you will have to try harder."}
{"text":"It was okay...  It was quiet at Solo Trattoria on a Saturday night. We suspect the 8pm time could be the reason. Still we marched on forward for out Cheat Meal there. We ordered the Meat and Cheese board along with Coppa Pizza and Shrimp Scampi for dinner.   The cheese board was fine. I wasn't dying for another bite but it wasn't inedible by any means. The sweet pickled veggies used anise star as a key spice. It's just not to my liking and found it off putting with the pickling application in this case. The Coppa Pizza was lacking in flavor. Again. It's just okay. Mediocre I guess. The shrimp scampi was the star of the night. Pasta was made to perfection and shrimp cooked to the T of any cook book. The flavors was spot on with just the right amount of heat. I was satisfied. BUT, my partner in crime didn't quite feel the same. Its obviously not ideal to NOT have the entire table happy at the end of the meal so that's that.   Although I've only had one pasta dish I feel I may conclude:  If you're craving pasta...GO, Try it. Pizza...ORDER MOD PIZZA INSTEAD...catch my drift?"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a very good date spot. The restaurant is dim lit which makes for a romantic ambiance. They had a musician playing and the music surprisingly wasn't disruptive. The appetizer which was bread was delicious and filling for two people.  Their pasta dishes have great presentation and taste equally as great. our server was friendly and so was the front desk. They are also ahead of the technology here. They have a system you sign into to earn points per visits. I highly recommend this restaurant and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"All the pasta was undercooked, as if the chef was just in too much of a hurry to let the pasta cook for an extra 3 min. It was completely raw and chewy in the middle.  The best thing about it was our server who totally understood what was going on and was very nice about it."}
{"text":"This is an old review from 2013 that just got posted; not sure why it didn't go up the last time. We had a wonderful meal here with great and personable service provided by Eli who was also the bartender and sommolier. In from NY, we took our 96 yr old father in law & 93 yr old Aunt here for a quiet meal that they could enjoy, which they & we did enormously. The homemade pasta, sauces, & meatballs were fabulous. We will definitely be back!  This is my new review from our visit in May 2016. Once again had a fabulous meal here with my husband, our 96 year old Aunt and our brother and sister in-law; unfortunately, my father-in law is no longer with us having passed at 98.   Anyway, when we made our reservation we asked if we could be seated at Eli's table and were told that he only worked the bar on Friday nights. When we got there we waved to him and came right over and warmly greeted us and actually remembered us pointing to where we sat the last time, 3 years ago! What a guy. He kept checking in with us during the meal to make sure that everything was great, which it was. Everyone was delighted with his or her meal and I still want more of those fabulous meatballs! To our surprise, Eli treated our table to a trio of desserts that were beyond delicious - he told us that he made the caramel / chocolate cheese cake, which was superb - surprising for me to say since I am a purest about cheesecakes.  After dinner when we couldn't locate the parking valet my husband went back into the restaurant for guidance and going above and beyond the call of duty, Eli came back out with him to help us. Just about then security was driving by and we called off the troops but I was astonished at Eli's willingness to run out and help us - what a guy!  If you want excellent food, caring, exceptional, personalized service, a pretty atmosphere, and reasonable prices - this is the place to go! We will ALWAYS stop here on trips to Phoenix - wish that this was in NY.  PS: I just read the other reviews and want to comment on the parking. One does NOT have to park across the street. Free valet parking is available right in front of the plaza that leads to the entrance to the restaurant. Also if we had looked at the note on our windshield when we didn't see the valet, we would have found a phone number to call for service."}
{"text":"So we were going to another popular restaurant around the corner from Solo Trattoria and while waiting we decided to give Solo Trattoria a try after looking at the menu and hearing the story behind the restaurant. As promised, the food is super fresh Tuscan style food. I believe he said \"Farm to table\" and he was dead on. The Burratta on toasts was excellent followed by the meatballs that my husband loved. We had the special and loved it. My husband is a definite meat and potatoes kind of guy and was looking forward to the traditional steak house appetizers from the place originally planned. But....he love the food at Solo Trattoria and we also loved trying a new family owned Phoenix business in the Biltmore area. I wish for their sake, they were on the beaten path, but I promise that if you take the extra walk through the tunnel or do the valet or the huge parking garage, you won't be disappointed with Solo Trattoria on the west side of the traditional Biltmore shops!"}
{"text":"I swoon at the pizza crust. Ordinarily, pizza crust is something I tolerate for the sake of the toppings. A crust generally deemed \"excellent\" merely ratchets me to a higher level of grudging tolerance. THIS crust is my crust of crusts. I did not want to stop eating it, and I'm a person who can stop eating and ignore actual chocolate, for heaven's sake!  The Old Man & the C cocktail is Happy Juice. Never have I been so filled with bonhomie. There are major pharma companies who wish they could bottle this effect.  Service is delightful and charming. This is such a pleasant little place in the vast Escher-esque wasteland of Camelback Esplanade. I used to mourn the loss of the Italian place at 16th Street near Indian School, but SOLO far surpasses it, at about the same price point."}
{"text":"Great Wednesday special - half off all bottles of wine.  Enjoyed the ham and fig and took home the salccicia.  The place was empty at 6:00pm, but the service was top notch.  I will definitely be back for their great happy hour and delicious pizzas."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here based on all the reviews. I met my boyfriend after work as we both work nearby, and I left feeling bad for having had wasted our time here.   Disclaimer: We just got back two days ago from San Francisco where we were wowed by service and quality by all price levels of dining, (We did try a couple amazing Italian restaurants as well) ...so maybe that combined with these reviews, we had high expectations.   The food: He had the flatiron and I had the gnudi, my dish was just okay. His was inedibly rare in some places and had to spit out a piece that was completely charred.. so there's that care and attention. The caprese appetizer wasn't provided with bread, which I thought was strange. Overall, the quality was just okay, but it was pretty inexpensive. So, I guess we got what we paid for.   The service: Our waiter was inattentive and seemed bothered by having to serve us. He spoke really fast and quiet and I had to call him back from rushing away to ask a question I still had, at one point. We put our entree order in with the appetizer and it still took 1 hour and 20 minutes to get our food. They seriously weren't that busy for this to be okay.   The icing on cake: I bought a living social for the app, entrees, dessert and dessert drinks. All we got to order was the app and entrees bc it took so long, and the waiter never bothered to ask about dessert things bc he was inattentive. I had to go ask inside about redeeming the deal as I never got the email from living social with the barcode. I showed them my confirmation page, and they suggested I call living social, (I did, and they were closed), then they asked to see my bank statement.. I wasn't sure it would show so soon; but it did, and they still told me they couldn't do anything. So we paid for the deal, the full price of our dinner which exceeded the deal, AND had a crappy \"Italian\" dinner. Furthermore, nobody took the time to apologize for the inconvenience; and we weren't rude about it. I felt like THEY felt inconvenienced by US.   It was supposed to be a romantic/fun date night.. We caught a movie after next door at the dine-in amc, we should have just had dinner at the theatre."}
{"text":"Three of us had the afternoon off, so we decided to give this place a try. So glad we did!  The food was wonderful tasting and very fresh. The serving size was perfect.  The staff was very friendly and attentive!  The drinks were outstanding!"}
{"text":"The appetizers were excellent! The drink specials for happy hour are amazing and the Chocolate Cake Vanilla Cream is to die for!!! Please try it you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"So confused. How did this place get such high reviews? Went here for my husbands birthday and was severely disappointed. I dont know if they didnt try as hard because we were doing the living social deal or if it was an off day, but I will not be returning to find out. I have yet to find good italian food since we moved to arizona and the search continues.  Our server was a nice guy but he was just lacking in service. Ordered overpriced cocktails that sounded complex and just ended up tasting like screwdrivers with melted ice and when we pointed out that they were missing straws, he handed us coffee stirrers that barely made it above the cups..when we needed more bread he'd empty it out off a plate back into our same bread basket instead of bringing a fresh basket. The bread was not evenly warmed either. The ends and outside of the bread would be hot and crisped but cold in the middle.  My husband got the mussel appetizer and it was very small for the price and lacking in flavor, usually theres that rich broth at the bottom but this was just watery. For his entree he got the papperdelle, noodles were very well done but they were ruined by the sauce that tasted of canned tomato sauce and needed more seasoning. Weve made better at home.  My entree was a vegan dish the server recommended that consisted of seasonal vegetables and zuccini noodles. Tasted like really bad stir fry. Needed some marinara sauce or something, and as far as seasonal vegetables, the brocolli and other vegetable choices did not seem very fresh or in season.   Even with the living social discount I felt like we paid too much for the quality of food we received. This may be good enough for some people, but when i go out to eat, its to have better food than i can make at home, and this place has some serious work to do."}
{"text":"Walked by while waiting to see a movie and checked he menu out front- one of the owners (I'm assuming) greeted us outside and suggested items. Very friendly and inviting so we decided to give it a shot!  YUM! Boyfriend got the spaghetti and meatballs and I got the funghi cream sauce pasta. Rich but delicious. Due to being slightly still hungover I didn't finish but definitely taking it home.   Bartender/server was very welcoming and they even brought us a salad on the house to start! Definitely welcoming and an at home feel here. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix ( Biltmore camelback area). Great service, validate parking too."}
{"text":"Just stopped in with my dad-- been meaning to try it. This is my new go-to Italian in the corridor. You're going to be hard pressed to have bad Italian anywhere the noodles are made fresh daily."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Great food, Great Drinks, and Great Atmosphere! Me and my lovely girlfriend enjoyed a nice little date night on a lovely Saturday Night and had a craving for some Italian food. We decided to check out this place and we did not regret it at all! We ordered the Brushcetta as a starter... and it was Awesome. Then we ordered the Shrimp Scampi and the Gnocci Bolognese. Both dishes were straight FIRE, I still have dreams about the Bolognese sauce! Both dishes were perfect and I must add that both dishes looked nearly as good as the company i enjoyed dinner with (aka my girlfriend :) ). However, the best part was the bread they served fresh out the oven with dinner!!! Outstanding!   Of course no meal was complete without desert and we scarfed down a piece of chocolate cake in no time! We did not leave hungry and we will be back soon! I highly recommend you try this place and come hungry.   Oh and i forgot to mention, they have beer and wine for days!   I hope you enjoy as much as we did!"}
{"text":"I initially asked to sit at a table in the dining room and when I asked to move to a window seat which is on my registration one of the owners had to come talk to me and he had a negative attitude. I attempted to say friendly gestures but he ignored them. My date was not happy with his response nor the very blue collar waitress. Loud and uncouth. We expected refined and a warm interaction with ownership. The owner working the door was equally unapproachable and appeared put off. I'm not sure what was going on but we did not feel welcomed which is expected from a restaurant such as this."}
{"text":"Not bad per se... But the pasta was undercooked and just didn't live up to the hype. 4.5 stars seems a bit generous. Again, not bad, just meh. I probably won't be back here any time soon."}
{"text":"Im glad we went here!  Perfect for informal dinner, tasty preparations--we had beet salad and half portion of risotto, a glass of chianti, and the best tiramisu ive ever had--Im 70.  Excellent service, good olive oil for dipping bread.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I went for the homemade pasta and ended up trying so many different things on their menu because everything they brought was incredible! Truth be told, I eat a vegan diet but once I got here I couldn't resist their pizza. It was so, so good. They have the best crust ever. So light and fluffy and fresh. Their marinara sauce was incredible too. I loved their Margarita Pizza- a must try! I also had their Rigatoni pasta dish which I could eat forever! I also had their House Salad which was great too. The staff was so courteous and friendly. We had great service even had a chance to meet the chef who said they his secret ingredient is Love. - Love it! They were so nice they even gave us complimentary Tiramisu- which I ate all of! There were no left overs here. It was so so so good. I can't wait to go back! This is my new favorite restaurant.   If you love Italian food, you MUST try this place! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"no pepper on tables at all meat and chesse platter had only one meat cappicola, and, it was awful, OLIVES HAVE PITS IN THEM. the risotto was too liquify the pizza not cooked right the desserts were awful:  CANNOLIS were not made right, the cheesecake was gross.  no wifi or OUTLETS."}
{"text":"Really great! Will definitely visit again. The servers were really nice and informative for us being a first time visitor."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant. Family owned restaurant. Incredibly fresh food. Great prices are fantastic people"}
{"text":"My boyfriend found this place through Groupon. It is now a new favorite of mine.   We did make reservations, as it was a Friday night, and we were seated quickly.  The ambiance was intimate with live music that was interesting to watch, yet fit into the background (bass & sax combo). This is a family business, and the pride in their enterprise is evident and justly so. Jon was a gracious host and Covey was the perfect waiter. Helpful with explaining the menu. Present when needed. Didn't hover.  The food was beautiful and delicious. The menu is limited, but I would bet that everything offered is wonderful. Any pasta can be substituted w/ gluten free as well.  We shared the bruschetta that included eggplant in its ingredients.  Delish. Even the bread it was served on was perfect. (toasted crusty, not too hard, right thickness). For dinner, I ordered the Gnudi. The ricotta dumplings were fantastic and the braised beef with horseradish gremolata was tender and perfect. My boyfriend had the Chicken Marsala. Absolutely yummy with tender, perfectly seasoned chicken and sauce.  For dessert we split the carrot cake. This was not your traditional carrot cake. It was more dense and fine, and I would actually hesitate to call it carrot cake. That being said, it was wonderful. Carrot-y and lemon-y, moist, with a frosting that was a perfect pairing.  I know the word perfect and delicious were repeated here many times, but they absolutely fit with this place. I'm very glad they had the groupon offer so we had the opportunity to discover this gem. We will definitely be returning.  To the family of Solo Trattoria, thank you for hosting such a wonderful dinner. It was an absolute pleasure."}
{"text":"Service was ok, at first..genuine but inexperienced.  The Wednesday night half priced bottles had a few disclaimers that they don't put in the Yelp promotion (nothing over $100 and no champagne). The tomato mozzarella dish was very good. The mussels were very salty and over cooked, along with the bread that accompanied. We would have told the server had he not informed us that the kitchen had already cooked our entrees and he didn't want them to get cold. The entrees were of very good concept and quality, but they were very under-seasoned. I'd come again just for the wine (and decent food if you're hungry) don't expect an amazing experience (even if you do run up a $160 bill for 2 in an empty restaurant). Oh and there was a lot of what appeared to be local art work on display. We weren't offered desserts, instead they brought us very hard and stale biscotti. I hate that I didn't love this place, but the rushed service and poor attention to detail on all the food was too much. I'd go back..definitely earlier though."}
{"text":"Family owned, made from scratch amazing Italian food. The lamb shank was to die for. The homemade biscotti was so moist and the service was fantastic. Did I mention Wednesday's have half price wine ! Highly recommended!!!!!"}
{"text":"Maltagliati is amazing!! Please please please order this dish! It was some of the best pasta I've ever had and since it's made fresh, you're able to get removed from it what you'd like (ie mushrooms for you non mushroom eaters). The pasta is homemade and in a sauce that is similar to a carbonara sauce. All the vegetables in it were fresh and delightful.   Make sure to ask for bread because you only get if you ask. It's regular bread but still tasty. Also, they ended my meal by giving me a homemade lemonchello shot."}
{"text":"Had a great experience. Hilary are server made great recommendations. We started with the acorn squash with burrata appetizer. Was a nice play off of a sweet & savory dish. For entrees with we shared the gnudi, shrimp scampi, and the eggplant all very good and authentic. For dessert the gelato trio is a must have. Will return when I'm back in town to this family run trattoria."}
{"text":"Best service ever and best food ever! Delicious pizza and appetizer! Best vodka ever and locally owned! Bam bam we love Carlos! Will go back."}
{"text":"And so... I went out to dinner with a friend to a local Italian restaurant tonight; a Wednesday in July in Phoenix. Who would have ever thought there'd be a 1 hour wait?  While I'm dying to find my favorite Italian restaurant, I'm from Philadelphia,  where the worst there is the best in other places, so I wasn't going to wait that long for pasta.   So, I grabbed my phone, checked Yelp, and found Solo Trattoria.  In doing so, I've found my favorite Italian restaurant in Phoenix.   Casual and comfortable, the location belies the true goodness of the homemade pastas, sauces, and deserts.  I had the pappardelle and fungi with added sausage. It was delicious!  Great wine list, 50% off most bottles, excellent appetizers too. The staff, particularly Jon and Trevor, were hospitable, friendly, and offered selections and suggestions, like this was a Michelin star restaurant.   Happy mistakes lead to happy moments.  Happy moments lead to Solo Trattoria.  Thank you, Jon and Trevor, for making your's my favorite Italian restaurant. Kudos to Grandma for her recipes!!!"}
{"text":"a last minute pick because Glendale Glitter was a dud, I picked up my phone checked out the best Italian Restaurants in Phoenix....I had a hundred to choose from. I'm so glad I stopped here! If you don't see something on the menu, ASK.....the chef wants to make you happy.....it's a win - win. We stopped on a Friday night, they had intimate live music - you can have a romantic dinner or sit at the bar and watch football. The staff was friendly, made you feel at home and the most important part was the food was amazing. It's a small place and it reminded me of my home town Chicago.....you won't regret it, stop by! yum yum"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Anything with the wide noodles is awesome and the mango Martini was great!"}
{"text":"I was actually looking for another restaurant that no longer existed apparently so stopped in here on a whim because I was so hungry.  I have the broasted chicken sandwich with an arugula salad  and I have to say it was probably the best sandwich I have ever had.  The bread was fresh and warm, the cheese on the sandwich was yum and hte sauce was not over powering.  Would go back again if I lived here."}
{"text":"Wow!  This new restaurant has to be the very best Italian in the Phoenix area.  It was so delicious my husband, another couple and myself could not stop raving as we enjoyed every single morsel of our antipasti, entrees, desserts and wine.  We each tried something different from the menu so we could taste it all.  The antipasti of the acorn squash, the cheeseboard, the eggplant and the bruschetta were a superb beginning for the dinners.  Such a wonderful different variety.  The entrees were excellent beyond description:  gnuchi w/braised beef and horseradish sauce; rissoto with pork belly (best rissoto I have tasted ever); salmon; and flat iron steak (usually my husband does not care for this cut of beef, however, it was prepared perfectly to protect the texture and taste).  Other entrees include pizza and various pasta dishes.  The desserts were just as dynamic and flavorful -- especially the pumpkin dessert. We were treated to a bottle of Le Lapin California wine which we were not familiar with and it was very good.  The ambiance is casual, the server (Eli) was a five star unto himself and had the very best recommendations from the menu and was familiar with all the ingredients, Jackie (the owner/family matriarch) was personable, welcoming and concerned with her diners' enjoyment of the dinner, service and restaurant.  As noted in another review, the restaurant can be tricky to find.  It is located near the Ritz Carlton, parking garage entered from the rear of the complex.  Worth searching for -- my first 5 star rating of a restaurant on any website.  Don't miss this one.   (I don't write many reviews; only for the ones I enjoy the most or those to recommend be avoided.)"}
{"text":"First off I want to apologize to my fellow yelpsters for not snatching photos; def a my bad on that 1.   Service: I wanted to start with this. Our servers name was Drew and he was by far the best server i've had in a long while. He was attentive and quick to recommend dishes.   Layout: The Restaurant has a blend between modern & traditional layout. They have featured artist art work for sale on the wall matched up with the casual environment for the servers.   Parking: Valet right up front and they validate, no need to park around the corner  Food: Oh baby the eclectic menu in this family owned Italian restaurant was amazing.    Appetizers: Meatballs were very good and extremely moist!! The porkbelly though, i would go back just for that. They do a full block porkbelly over a wholegrain mustard. The char on the belly mixed with the moistness inside was killer!!!  Dinner: Their Paperdelle pasta was amongst the best i've ever had on questions asked. Their triangle cut pasta with the peas and pork was just silly. Idk if you can go wrong with any pasta there.  Dessert: Chocolate Lava Cake with gelato. It made me want to take a bath in it, it was so good.    No question I will be back next time im in town to check it out!!"}
{"text":"I really liked the vibe of this restaurant, the live music, and ambience. I was looking for a nice Italian place to try and found Solo on Yelp. The reviews were pretty good and I loved how easy I could make a Friday night reservation from their website via Open Table. I ordered the salmon cakes (only 1) and the roasted tomato plate along with a glass of the red blend. I LOVE my salmon cakes and tomatoes done three ways. My companion ordered Chicken Verdue, it was okay. The chicken was moist but could use more flavor. I think I would really give a 3.5 but Ill go ahead and give the 4 stars since I will most likely return."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was average which is such a bummer because this is such a cute little spot I was expecting more from it. Maybe being from Vegas I am spoiled when it comes to moderately priced dining options that are delish! I must say I was not impressed."}
{"text":"After seeing the reviews and the groupon deal, I decided to give Solo a try. My boyfriend and I are huge italian food fanatics, so we used the groupon deal for a date night. This little place is nestled quietly in the Biltmore area, and has a wonderful quaint ambiance filed with local art. We had the meatballs as an appetizer, and they were wonderful! Although the last meatball we shared and found a small piece of plastic inside of the meatball. We immediately notified the staff and without question or prompting they comped us a new appetizer of the glazed pork belly which was phenomenal!! We understand mistakes happen and how they handled the mistake was a clear representation of how they value their customers. We ordered entrees of the Gnudi and the Chicken Marsala. I really appreciated the time and care it took to craft the fresh pasta, and the marsala sauce was chock full of porcini mushrooms! SOOO DELISH! My boyfriend was overwhelmed by the rich and complex flavors of the gnudi, and he took his time savoring his entree. Despite being ridiculously full, we did order the black forrest cheesecake which was DIVINE!! Our service was prompt, professional and courteous. We will definitely be back for more!!"}
{"text":"A Wonderful Place made so, not only be truly excellent food, but also by Outstanding Service.  Great Italian dishes with homemade pasta and wonderful sauces. We be back!"}
{"text":"Our server was amazing! You can definitely tell that this place is family owned but with an intimate setting! Our server had great recommendations and even told us about a Groupon deal that they were offering. Great drinks and food was well priced! I had the shrimp scampi and it was delicious! Will be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about here, saw a deal on amazon so thought we would try it.  They charge me $2 extra for my kettle one served ice. Cheese and meat plate had one slice of salami slice up in little slivers, a few cheeses, some were dried out, looked like maybe left out. Had to ask for pepper and fresh parmesean, my spegghiti was over cooked and with the maranra reminded me of caned Chef Boyardee."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, better than pizzeria Bianco. great wine too!!!!!!  Plus live music. So much fun."}
{"text":"#100 for 2013! Woot! Anyway, I went to SOLO for my birthday dinner with my mom and it was very good! We shared the funghi pizza and the pasta with the nettle pesto. The pizza was great, it was fresh and earthy. It had a pancetta agrodulce on it, which was good, kind of like a dressing, but I thought it would have had pieces of pancetta on it. The pasta was also very good, the pesto was delicious and the peas were fresh. We shared a bottle of delicious moscato d'asti, half priced because it was Wednesday, and for dessert we had the budino which was nice and tasted like nutella and was very tasty. On top of all that, the prices were very reasonable. I had plenty of food for lunch for 2 days after the meal. I would definitely come back to SOLO again!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  It is in a strange location--on the first floor of the Esplanade--below the AMC movie theatre, but it is well worth seeking out.  There's something so great about supporting a local business that features notes on the menu like, \"Mom's favorite\" or a cocktail named for one of the brothers.   We had:  bruschetta (so interesting--eggplant was something I'd never seen on one before), mushroom/shrimp risotto and pizza.  In this town, a lot of people can do amazing pizza... and Solo is certainly among them.   Go go go!  Support local, family-owned business."}
{"text":"The menu here is exquisite and never disappoints, however our service tonight was less than impressive. We had reservations for 8 pm, but due to construction in the plaza {not mentioned by the host when making our reservation} we ending up being 20 minutes late for our reservation. We did call and let the restaurant know we were running late. When we arrived our server, Hilary, went to take our drink and appetizer order before 2 of our party of 6 settled in. After appetizers she said \"you need to hurry up and order entrees before the kitchen closes\". It was 8:25, and the restaurant advertises being open until 9 pm. After taking our rushed dinner orders, Hilary continued to rush our dessert order. We felt very I unwelcomed and rushed and have never had this kind of experience at Solo. After having frequented this restaurant and always been impressed, we decided whole walking in, that we were going to tip our server $100 because 1) we were late for our reservation 2) we had a groupon for $300 worth of food for which we paid $150 3) we were dining there after a very expensive failed Vegas trip for the weekend and 4) I am a server myself, and have beat tipping 20% into my family's head. Being a server, I do understand the frustration that comes with guests walking in 10 even 15 minutes before close, however we were there in ample time to eat and be out of the restaurant 15 minutes after close. We ended up tipping Hilary 16%, which we thought was more than deserving. We will certainly return to Solo, however, we will be sure to request a sever other than Hilary."}
{"text":"Service was superb by one of the managers named drew. Started with the caprese appetizer which is a must have due to its 3 different types of heirloom tomatoes with burrata and mozzarella cheese. He suggested the shrimp scampi and it was a great blend of spice and cream. I highly suggest to sit near the bar which has been conveniently built out for viewing of any sporting event. 5 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"SOLO does an AMAZING job of service, quality local seasonal ingredients, and expert execution.  We had 2 different pizzas (fabulous), meatballs, burrata, asparagus wrapped in prosciutto with fondue cheese (outstanding), rigatoni (the only pasta not house made), flat-iron steak (perfect) and olives (amazingly delicious). The pizza was perfectly cooked, great crispy/chewy crust, flavorful cheese, quality meats, and perfect amount of sauce.  The meatballs were a good size, good quality meat, but a touch too much oregano that took over a little too much of the flavor.  Also, while the tomato sauce was tasty, it could use a minor tweak, maybe a few tomato chunks? I'm sure this is a matter of preference, the sauce has a good flavor, but maybe too much of a puree consistency. The burrata was delicious but could use a sprinkle of sea salt.  While I'm on the subject, since SOLO has such high quality ingredients, ditch the standard salt shaker, and use little bowls of sea salt w/ a tiny spoon.  It's a touch we expect from a quality establishment like this. The grilled asparagus with prosciutto is out of this world good.  BRAVO!  The rigatoni is just ok, but it's their only pasta not house made.  It was a little dry and boring, but ok.  The flat iron steak was perfectly cut, seasoned, and grilled.  It's accompanying arugula salad was fresh and flavorful but I think accidentally salted twice.  Nothing else was over salted, but this dish.  The marinated olives had fantastic flavor picked up from the fresh herb marinade. The atmosphere is pleasant, but too non-descript.  I think this town is starving for more restaurants with atmosphere that has character and charm ala The Parlor and Postino.  The use of recycled wood, cool light fixtures, and some whimsical touches would go a long way here.   The wait staff was fantastic.  One of the owners, John, came by the table.  He was nice, passionate, and genuine. They were offering a free app or dessert to Iron Man movie goers.  I thought it was a great way to bring in new customers, but they need a board that can also face the East/West direction so people can see this coming off the elevators.  Their happy hour is also fantastic.  Most everything under $7 and all delicious. I'm glad you are here SOLO!!  Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Management refused to honor coupon which inconveniently expired on a day during which the restaurant was closed.  Really? Why lose customers permanently over a $15 coupon?  Why not just honor the coupon and avoid the bad rep?    SOLO, if you don't like honoring coupons, stop flooding the internet with them.  Don't blame the customers after you've closed up shop and avoided them.  Summary:  Friendly waitstaff, cosy atmosphere, but only one or two tasty items on menu.  Moreover, owners need to reassess approach to honoring coupons which have been purchased by customers and often expire on SOLO holidays."}
{"text":"Excellent pork belly!  The food was outstanding and the service was friendly and attentive. This restaurant is a terrific addition to the Phoenix marketplace."}
{"text":"We ate their twice and both times had serious red flags and worse. Perhaps my wife would say only one star for Solo Trattoria. On the first visit the waitress had bold face lied and told us their food was organic and non-gmo. We researched later and found they are neither. At both visits I had indigestion- it was light, but I haven't had it in many years. They add chemicals and heap on unhealthy ingredients to improve the richness and taste of their food- and we are in the position to know!! We will never return to this so-called italian gourmet restaurant.Their food is dirty and very suspicious. Giving two stars for the ambiance and the price we paid thru groupon."}
{"text":"My son & I eat here as often as possible.  The food is literally out of this world.  The staff is extremely kind and considerate they treat you like family. We have had an excellent meal each and every time we have come. Whether it has been a mix of kids and adults,  just my son and I or just myself and some business associates.  Solo Trattoria is one of the best places I have ever eaten - highly recommend for anyone!!!"}
{"text":"The place offered enclosed parking on the back and it is situated in one of the most magnificent play space in the city.  Very friendly server introduced himself and gives great impression and service standsrds.  The problem came with my plate where the freshness of seafood is questionable so I ended up with cramps all night long.  My friends Salmon was cooked to perfection garnish with cook beans and Brussel sprouts.  The Cheese cake and tiramisu was heavenly.  He forgot our coffee order but apologize right away.  Would have earned a five star if I didn't feel ill.  Had to take a immodium AD to sleep with gas all night long.  Next time I probably won't order seafood since we are hundreds  miles away from ocean.  Will return soon."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an intimate and romantic Italian night out, this is your place!  We came on a Saturday night and they had live music - a lady playing cover songs on acoustic guitar.  While it was a little awkward towards the end of the night (bc the restaurant was pretty much empty and there were only 2 tables left) it was still nice to hear her play.  We came here with a voucher deal for a price-fixe menu, so we got to share an appetizer, pick two entrees, and share a dessert.  (it also came with after dinner shots but we skipped those...).  For our appetizer we ordered the \"simple salad\" which was exactly what it sounded like.  Basically just greens, carrots, and croutons in a balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  I enjoyed it.  For my entree I ordered the shrimp scampi.  It came with thick, flat noodles in an orange-colored cream sauce.  It was slightly spicy, but not overpowering.  I really liked the dish, but I would have liked it more if my noodles had been cooked just a BIT longer.  They were slightly hard and not cooked enough.  I still finished almost the whole dish.  Dessert was their special for the night, a turtle cheesecake.  It was moist, thick, creamy.  Just what you'd want and expect in a cheesecake!  My biggest gripe is that their menu needs better descriptions of the entrees.  Most of the entrees just have the Italian name, with very little detail.  For example, \"Chicken Ciambotta\" is listed under \"pasta\" but it's actually a type of stew and it comes out with NO pasta in it.  I had to google most of the names of the entrees to try and figure out what they were.  I understand I could ask our server, but I would've had to ask him for like 10 different descriptions, and I didn't feel like doing that."}
{"text":"This was a Groupon find and I am glad we found it. First off, getting in was not easy. We ended up parking at the mall and walking.   The food was amazing. My wife is normally so-so with meat and cheese plates but even she enjoyed everything on that app. The pizza was among the best we've had in the valley. The deserts were generous though not huge.  Now for what really stood out. The service. Our waiter was the most helpful I've ever met in a restaurant. He gave us advice but was not just pushing the expensive items. He was always there when we wanted a refill or had a question but was never there when we just wanted to talk.  There was live music and the singer was good and fit the ambiance of the restaurant perfectly. Overall it was a prefer dinner out to relax and enjoy some great food. This was one of those times that Groupon put a place on our radar for the next time we are across town."}
{"text":"Decent food...but not great, considering its high prices."}
{"text":"Loved it so much I went back last night. I had the Spaghetti squash with Salmon. It was an amazing no-wheat dinner. I finished it off with a three-flavor cheesecake that was so good I wanted to take it home for my family. Unfortunately, I live about an hour away by plane, so that didn't happen. :)  Excellent food, friendly staff, what more could I want?"}
{"text":"Ridiculous amazing service. The owner came and talked with us as he had a boatload of complimentary appetizers brought out. Family owned and almost all of the food is locally sourced with sausage from Schreiners and beef from neiman ranch. Food was delicious and carefully made. A great phoenix addition!"}
{"text":"I went about 15 minutes before closing time on a Friday night. The crowd had definitely dwindled. The maitre de was really nice and so was my waiter. The wine was exquisite. My pizza was ho-hum, and that's really why I went. I'd been craving pizza all week long and this was my splurge. I probably would've been just as happy (if not happier) with Dominos. Maybe next time I'll try the pasta. I'm sure it will be out of this world. Very nice setting, very nice staff. I'll go back, but I'll order something other than the pepperoni pizza."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent and the prices reasonable. We had the cheese board, the rigatoni, and the frutti di mare, and everything was delicious. The service was good as well. I think this is a great restaurant that just needs to match its ambiance to its menu and make the decor a little classier."}
{"text":"The meatball sub is the best I have had in Az so far. The service was outstanding. I sat at the bar and talked with the owner. My server was the best! I can't wait to go back. I hope they do well at this location."}
{"text":"This was a delight in every regard.  The décor is contemporary and upbeat.  The cuisine amazing.  We started out with the salmon cakes in a sweet chili sauce delicious!  The main course was eggplant parma which was cooked to perfection and melted in our mouths.  We ordered a bottle of Italian wine it was a blend and perfect with our meal! Adriana our server was very well versed on all menu items and her personable service was the icing on the cake!  I am from the LA area of California and there is no shortage of great cuisine but this certainly was comparable or better!"}
