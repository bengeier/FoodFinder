{"text":"Yum! One of the best real authentic Italian restaurant I ever been. With a beautiful terrace, just a hidden jem."}
{"text":"Family owned, great service, same waiter for at least 10 years (son of the chef, I believe).  Fresh food, menu specials change daily.  Best for LUNCH, CBC across the street does a great business at lunchtime.  Have tried in the evening, never sure if OPEN.....would call for dinner reservations.  Nice wine list, casual and non-pretentious, just wish some of the crowds from St. Catherine's would find the way one block south to Rene Levesque and find this GEM , and keep it OPEN every night for dinner !  Well I guess the dad and son need some time off too !"}
{"text":"The waitstaff is awesome. Very helpful . The place is nice as well. Waiter gave us great recommendations. I had the salmon with mustard sauce which was great. My gf had the veal and she loved it. We came all the way from florida and would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Old school Italian restaurant. Excellent service & good value."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Montreal! The service was fantastic and the food was great, too! The bruschetta was the best bruschetta I have ever had! I would highly recommend this place!"}
