{"text":"It's hard to find a really good Chinese food place around here!! This is one of my favorites in this area. I recommend the shrimp egg foo Yeung (not sure how it's spelt), the orange chicken and the beef and broccoli!"}
{"text":"Careful what you order. You may not be happy eating anywhere else. Excellent egg rolled and pot stickers.  Will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Ok, I wasn't expecting a lot when my husband and I wanted something quick to eat and a little different and our usual Rubios, but I should have trekked a little further to Pei Wei. 

I was craving pad thai and I knew this place had it, so I order that with no meat. I then asked if I could have tofu instead. The guy at the counter asked if I wanted the tofu deep fried. I said no and my husband ordered two egg rolls. The total was $19! I knew that was off, so when I mentioned it, he said that the tofu was a brick of tofu. I told him I didn't need a whole block of tofu, just some to put in my pad thai. He then said he couldn't do that? What?? You can sell whole blocks of it, but you can't put it in my food? I said no to the tofu and waited for our food.

After we got home, I opened my food to find big chuncks of beef, chicken, and shrimp in my pad thai. I'm a vegetarian, so that's not good. My wonderful husband took it back for me and when he returned, I only ate about 5 bites. Wasn't good at all. Next time, I'll stick with Pei Wei. Maybe I'll have that for lunch!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Chinese food! I recommend the three musketeers meal. Great customer service as well :)"}
{"text":"Please take my recommendation...do not eat here.  Two adults and a toddler taken out with stomach pain...what are the chances?? The food is not express...took forever to get and the food had no flavor. Not sure how they prepare their items but we ordered orange chicken, teriyaki, and lo mein...all were chicken items. I will not eat here again and you shouldn't either.  I feel bad but just had to warn people as I typically leave positive feedback for other restaurants but maybe it was a bad chicken supply. They need to improve!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Chinese food but they are FAST. All of the staff is pretty stingy when it comes to asking for extra anything. Especially the red chili paste. No idea why. They do however have really good egg drop soup. It's been pretty hard to find a good one out there. Also, the staff RARELY messes up an order which is awesome."}
{"text":"First time there based on the reviews. We went for dinner.  The place was deserted but i got a feeling that most is done by take out in the evening based on all the orders on the counter.  Got the lemon chicken and upgraded to the combo for dinner.  The food was good for the price.  I would say most of the lemon sauce was buried in the cabbage vs on the chicken.  Next time I'll ask for some extra sauce on the side.  Can't wait to try a lunch special."}
{"text":"Orange Chicken is delicious.  I am absolutely in love with their Wor Wonton Soup, it has all the essentials, no noodles but the wontons give it that kick. :)"}
{"text":"I read the other reviews, I don't see how they earn a three star. Maybe their attitude change for the worest; maybe its the summer heat, In my book that owner lady is definately NOT FRIENDLY !!! she is a bitch !!, she brought out the wrong oder, we took a few bit before we realizing it was not what we ordered, she insisted we pay for it anyway - because we already eat it (three bits worth). The man is nicer, he came out and take care of our complain. 
The food is pretty much like other Americanized chinese restaurant. - Cheap and plenty.
As for me, I won't be back here again;  plenty Other good Chinese restaurant to choose from."}
{"text":"The owners and employees are so incredibly sweet and attentive. Continuously checked if we needed anything at all. Even gave my daughter a free soda and lollipops. The food is excellent. My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"This is by far the WORST \"Chinese food\" ever. I can't even call it that. It has no flavor and the orange chicken was soggy. Gross gross gross. I wouldn't waste your money! It has been around for awhile, but honestly I can't see why."}
{"text":"We take-out from Wangs all the time. Sometimes we'll order over the phone, other times we'll sit and wait - they are always fast and friendly.  The food - well it's Chinese takeout.... and it's good, nothing that will ever appear in a Zagat guide - but certainly a nice takeout treat. I particularly like the glazed walnut shrimp and order it every time. reasonably priced.  if they ever get too crowded, with a long wait (rare ) you can always walk and shop a little, but the outside tables and benches (and fountain) are a very pleasant way to pass the time,"}
{"text":"First off, it's fast Chinese, and they lived up to their promise on that one, we did get our dinners fast. I am a huge fried rice fan; and I have to say theirs was horrible, stick to plain white or brown rice. However, I had the beef with broccoli and that was ok. It's not like Beef with broccoli is exploding with flavor anyways, so I can confidently say they didn't mess it up. What I do like about this place (besides how quick our food came out) is that you can do the meal deal , typically only offered at lunch, for dinner which gets you the egg roll and crab puff at dinner. I love crab puffs, again theirs was just ok and I didn't care for the egg roll all that much. Overall it was fast, filled me up with a huge portion that I took home lots of left overs; they were open kind of late - until 10, and it wasn't the worse thing I ever ate. Also, they had very friendly service."}
{"text":"Great place - just moved from Seattle where Chinese restaurants almost outnumber Starbucks. Food good, great portions, fair price, and the person at the counter was very pleasant. 

I have finally found my Chinese food place (at least when I'm payin' ! )

I had to use the bathroom and it was clean, Paul. 

I'll definitely be going back......"}
{"text":"Love this little Chinese place. They give huge portions, and it's delicious to top it off. Usually Chinese food beef is so chewy and hard, and this is the only place I've been that hasn't. The staff here are so nice too. This is my new Chinese go to :)"}
{"text":"Definitely do not recommend. The food has no flavor whatsoever and it upseted everybody's stomach after eating their food. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Ok place if you are starving and need something quick. Cheap prices. Grabbed lunch here and it was too greasy. Not much flavor. Meat had somewhat of an after taste like it was sitting in the freezer too long? And my quest for great Chinese food continues..."}
{"text":"Not too shabby.  I had Mandarin chicken and fried rice and an egg roll.  Chinese is never my favorite but Wang Express was good.  Portion sizes were impressive.  I'm always a bit apprehensive with pricey Chinese food (even the fast food variety) but they offer a good value here."}
{"text":"We ordered House Rice Noodle, Crab Angels and Kung Pao Beef on 1/27/18. When it comes to Chinese food, my husband and I are pretty picky and Wang Express definitely met our expectations! My noodles were perfectly seasoned and so as the Kung Pao Beef. Definitely recommend Wang Express for Chinese food if you are in this area!"}
{"text":"Small cozy little place run by a friendly family. Food is tasty, service quick & prices reasonable. We usually grab something quick to eat at this place before heading out to FatCat Ballroom. I particularly like the snow peas chicken and low mein. 

So far I thought it was only PF Chang's in Scottsdale. But now I've found 2 more! Wang Express in Phoenix & Oriental buffet in Tempe. 

For great Chinese food, just go to the bay area in CA."}
{"text":"Wangs Express is great! I prefer their Mongolian beef. Great service and delicious quality food!"}
{"text":"This place is literally located in front of our place so we've had it a few times. The mongolian beef was really not good but the orange chicken is my favorite. The portion size is nice and we usually take it to go since we are so close. The sweet and sour chicken is really good here too."}
{"text":"omg!!!! the orange chicken is absolutely amazzzzzzzing!!!!  i get food here once a week~~~it's THAT delicious 
so much yummy for your tummy!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, great prices! The staff were on the ball - I had egg drop soup which was delish & veggie fried rice as well - my fiend had the lunch special of orange chicken that can with rice, egg roll and 1 wonton- looked great and she said it was good. Definitely going to go back again."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 20 years. My family`s Xmas tradition is to always get take out from here on Christmas Eve. Every year the food has been very tasty and inexpensive. This year for whatever reason the food was awful. What has happened to this place? Has it changed hands, or are they trying to save money by serving garbage. The orange chicken was absolutely terrible. It seemed to consist of left over bits of crap left at the bottom of the grill. Even the rice was bad. After coming here for over 20 years, we are done, won`t be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is soooo not that bad! The existing reviews are a bit scary, yes, but we ventured inside this place when we were next door getting frozen yogurt. We were surprised at the prices and the menu choices so the hubby to be decided to give it a try. We tried the orange chicken and the honey walnut shrimp. Not bad! It's not the greatest Chinese food in the world but it's better than the over flavored, calorie bombs at Panda Express (which btw, my friends, is NOT real Chinese food so stop using it for comparison). 

The restaurant itself leaves a lot to be desired and the handful of times we've been there since then or passed by it the place is usually empty of diners. BUT, that does not mean it doesn't have loyal customers. We've seen lots of people running in for quick to go orders so I guess that is where they thrive. They are fast in service and prices are cheap so we'll be going back for take out too."}
{"text":"Have been to several in the area. This is the best so far. Special/house chow mein, and pork fried rice were very good. The almond chicken had real almonds and vegetables, Chicken not deep fried. Very good."}
{"text":"A such a great restaurant all around! Always great costumer service, the food is delicious & the price isn't too expensive! My favorite hands down!"}
{"text":"Unlike other parts of the country I haven't found too many take out/small eat in Chinese restaurants in the north Scottsdale/Phoenix area, but if want something healthy and reasonably priced Wang's is an excellent choice. This is not a fancy place but the food is tasty and healthier than fast food. Portions are ample. Family is very friendly. TV usually on if you eat in. Also some outdoor seating. Better than 3, I would say 3.75. Rounded off to 4."}
{"text":"I live in Scottsdale with some pretty bad Chinese restaurants. The typical lunch special there is $9-$10 and bad. When I can I go to Wangs Express which is cheaper and much better. Anyone who thinks this restaurant is poor really should travel around a bit and see what many are serving for what prices. This place is not super fancy, but the food is quite good and the prices are fair. The standard fried rice is better than most, and spring rolls fine. Service is generally quick.  I would say portions are average but better than average for the price. Overall a neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"First time there.  Ordered Lemon Chicken and Crab Angels (Puffs) for take out.  Crab puffs were done about 5 minutes before Lemon Chicken, so were barely warm.  Lemon chicken had about a tablespoon of lemon sauce on it so the dish was dry.
I might try them again for something else, but this was disappointing."}
{"text":"First thing, it's Wang's Express, not Wang Express.

I'm really picky when it comes to food, but I'm not a snob.

I really like this place!!! They told me they've been open for about 17 years with the same cook so they must be doing something right !!!!

To others that gave this place poor reviews, the food is what it is, FAST FOOD, even says so on the sign, but better for you than the \"chain\" fast food I'll bet!

Every time I've eaten here the guy at the counter is so very friendly and helpful. The food always comes out quick and fresh and tastes better than most of the other fast food Chinese places around this side of town. All white meat chicken is a plus for me and they can change the level of spiciness (heat) if you ask. Hot or Not?

So far I've had the Orange and Mandarin Chicken, Vegetable Beef (pepper sauce added cause I like it hot), Chicken Fried Rice (add Bean Sprouts), Crab Angels, Egg Rolls (I love), and Mongolian Beef!

Everything I have ordered I've liked. Tonight I went back try the Kung Pao and it was as expected, very good.

SPECIALS!!! They have lunch and dinner combos that come with so much food I always have lunch the next day, two meals for the price of one!"}
{"text":"Delish I love this place. They are so fast at this place I love it. Good Chinese coming to ya very quickly. Super family friendly as well. I'll keep coming back to this place time after time to get my Asian fix."}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" Chinese take out place!!  The first time I went with my boyfriend (who's been eating here for YEARS), I was skeptical because the place is, well, not pretty.  It's basically a few aging booths, dingy lighting, fake plants, 80's décor, & a restroom that needs an overhaul.  Don't let that get you down though, the food is fantastic!!  The staff is super friendly, & the food comes out hot & fast.  We have been ordering take out from Wang's for about 3 or 4 years & I've never had a complaint about the food or upset stomach.  I just recommended a co-worker who moved into the neighborhood & she was very happy with the food as well!  Go ahead & give it a try!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried any other one of their entrees or sides but I had have the hot and sour soup and it was very very good. I will be back for more soup! Oh and the prices are very affordable! If a poor college kid can afford it, you can too. Haha! :D"}
{"text":"The place is tiny,  but service is good and House Chicken is GREAT. The staff are friendly and helpful and servings are huge... Even for a Chinese restaurant. You have to get to the bottom of the carry out container for veggies because their portions of the meat in the dishes is very generous compared to a lot of places."}
{"text":"I must confess that I am a little surprised by the 2.5 star rating for this tasty and dependable, Cantonese American, family owned, neighborhood spot. (Based upon 7 reviews, as of 12/30.) Upon closer look, it is apparent that this seemingly low average is due to bad reviews by a couple of disappointed customers - who probably should not have been at this place in the first place. No, this is not a salad place. It is not a tofu place. It is not a vegetarian place. And it is not your friendly, sensitive, new age pan-Asian sort of place. It is a DELICIOUS, better-than-average, but not aspiring to be the best, gritty, unhealthy, high fat, high cholesterol, high sodium, high sugarm, high MSG, high everything, sort of place - with a good dose of cultural differences on the side. Just how we want it when, once in a while, we all get that craving. You know... the craving. Plus the young guys that usually work the counter are a couple of cool, hard working, dudes."}
{"text":"My husband did not want to order from here, but I was in the mood for orange chicken, and our favorite restaurant was closed. Horrible!  The chicken was as tough as leather!  First and last time. Three menu away."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place at all.  The prices may be great but not the food quality.  I asked for Mongolian beef to eat on site and they gave it to me in a Styrofoam container. I had a hard time eating out of it. .don't they have bowls and plates here? ??... They forgot my water too...and the beef. ..was it really beef??...hmmmm....sorry but I won't be coming back here EVER!!!!! : ("}
{"text":"First time ordering here and will be the last. Ordered House Noodles (crispy) and orange chicken, both have a weird taste. I paid more here than what I would have gotten from Panda Express."}
{"text":"Good,  fast,  and reasonably priced Chinese food. We ordered house fried rice,  house lo mein, orange chicken,  and crab wonton.  Very fresh and delicious.  Plenty of leftover for later :) will most definitely return."}
{"text":"Food isnt bad if the family that owns it would lighten up a little bit.  I work literally 20 steps away from their front door and they said sorry sir, we do not deliver.  I said, You realize I'm next door, and he said yes, but we do not deliver.   Lost a customer that would normally eat there at least once a week."}
{"text":"The hot and sour soup was delicious - ask for extra spicy (much better). The red curry is great, and I will be returning to try the green. Chicken fried rice was bland-ish, but still okay."}
{"text":"Good food but not Express on weekends.  I have enjoyed the Mongolian beef.  Their ribs are very good.  Still waiting for tonight's order and it has been almost 35 mins.  Weekdays shorter wait times.  Still good food."}
{"text":"Love the orange chicken. The same guy I always behind the counter with a smile on his face. I love we can go here and get the same great service and delicious food every time."}
{"text":"The pot stickers and pork fried rice are amazing, making this our favorite Chinese place so far.  The lo mein and egg rolls aren't to my personal tastes, but I'm yet to find a restaurant at any price point where I love everything on the menu. The service is always fast, the people are friendly, and the food is made fresh to order. Can't ask for much more than that!"}
{"text":"The fried rice was fatty and gross. I would have better luck a panda express. And there AC was out in the summer...."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, big portions and friendly staff.  I go there all the time for my Chinese food."}
{"text":"Decent place for quick chinese. I don't like the fact that they don't serve the food in authentic chinese take out containers, but hey its still ok.  I don't go there often but when I don't feel like going across town to my favorite place, I pick this one in a quick pinch. Plus the owners are really nice :)"}
{"text":"I came here for some potstickers and chicken fried rice. I really liked the food and sauce, plus it came out fairly quickly. I wouldn't mind coming back again for another bite."}
{"text":"My mom started bringing their honey dipped chicken wings home for dinner 15 years ago, went there today and it's still good; even better!"}
{"text":"Chinese semi-fast food.  They prepare the food quickly and the quality is consistent.  Service is friendly.  They have been operating for a while and not much has changed.  The good news is that they keep the place clean and in working condition.  

The menu has quite a few items.  Get the large items as the small comes dinner style."}
{"text":"We got here Sunday about 3:15 in the afternoon. Wangs was deserted. It's still run by the same, now aging, couple.  My friend went to the restroom... like the couple, aging but clean.
I try to sneak in an order of appetizers - pot stickers, egg rolls, and fried wontons. The pot stickers, mostly filled with ground pork, won for me, but that's not saying much... Why settle for bland. Good news - The fried items were crisp,  not greasy. The sauce missed the mark. My idea of a decent sauce includes teriyaki sauce, a bit of sesame oil, chili flakes, and something acidic. Does 2 out of 4 count?
My friend and I both got shrimp dishes. She got them with nice crisp, beautifully colored veggies and reasonably (med.) sized shrimp only slightly overcooked. My kung pao's veggies were equally beautiful, the peanuts fresh. There were fewer smaller more overcooked shrimp.
I gave them two stars because, despite the below average food, the service was excellent. 
Would I recommend it to you? As my friend just said, \"It was clean and I didn't get sick.\""}
{"text":"Wehave gone to Wang's for years and the other day I ordered brown rice instead of white and there was a $1.50 charge!!!!  That is outrageous and we will NEVER return.  There is notextra charge at any other restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice fast food!! Ultimate.. We had orange chicken, mushroom chicken, some shrimp with chau meen.. Everything was fantastic.."}
{"text":"Outstanding Chinese fast food. The service was great and food delicious. Not a place to go for fancy dining but a great takeout."}
{"text":"Wangs has been here a long time. The food is not like the best NY Chinese you may have had, but it's not bad either.  Good when you have the craving for General Tso chicken. House lo mein is a good choice too."}
{"text":"Honestly, I am surprised at the number of negative reviews for this place, but it seems that all the newer (2013 start and forward) have been positive, and we have good things to say about it too!  The pork fried rice is amazing and the pot stickers are a new fave also.  I will say that we are not huge fans of the lo mein here, but that is true of all the Chinese restaurants we have tried locally, so it really isn't that big a deal.  

The cashier is the same gentleman each time and each time he is unfailingly nice and smiling.  

Other bonus features: the place is clean, the parking lot is easy to find a spot in, most people are taking to-go orders, so if you want to dine in it's actually pretty quiet, and it's next door to a Starbucks if you want somewhere to relax after in the now cooler air!

Overall: A
We highly recommend the pot stickers and fried rice with any of the meat additions (chicken, pork, beef, etc.)"}
{"text":"so, yeah. stopped by for lunch today, had the teriyaki chicken salad. not quite sure how this was a salad - 5 strips of teriyaki chicken on a bed of iceberg lettuce? ok, i'll concede that generally chinese food restaurants don't do salads well, but still. that was pathetic. chicken was fatty. sauce was flavorful. oh and my table had a funky plant/fake flower vase ... the green leaves were alive and in water, the fake flowers were mixed in with the live plant. weird."}
{"text":"Soon as I entered the door, it smelled of faint septic waste and that's no exaggeration either. Its not just me who noticed it, but it did stank. I put one star because there is nothing lower. I love Chinese food but this place must be the worst restaurant I've ever set foot on."}
{"text":"Wang is one of the best Chinese takeout places around. I eat here all the time. The highlight is their crab puff angel rangoon things which are the best in Phoenix. They are more garlic umami flavored instead of sweet which is a good thing in my book. Only bad note is my wife would never eat here. She is a vegetarian and does not like Chinese food."}
{"text":"Wang's Express is a good place to go when you are in a hurry. I havent found much in the way of good chinese food in Phoenix, but Wang's is probably the best. The service is super friendly and they always willing to make sure my lo mein has a little amount of cabbage and onion in it upon request. 

The place itself isn't much to look at and the bathroom as been known to smell like burnt brown sauce. I rarely eat-in though, I usually take-out. The prices aren't bad and they do have some pretty good lunch and dinner specials. 

My boyfriend isn't a fan of their friend rice so he usually orders orange chicken and I tend to toss up between mandarin hot chicken (aka general tso's) and hour lo mein. Unlike most chinese eateries their lo mein is full of yummy noodles and plenty of meat! I also like their wonton soup, it is a bit bland but it does the trick."}
{"text":"Just about any kind of Asian food is always my preference so I've tried many places. Wang's Express is more of \"fast food\" style restaurant but has a surprisingly large menu to choose from. They have lunch specials; which are like combo meals with rice and egg rolls and such, or dinner plates in different sizes. While I admit I'm not a fan of their egg rolls, everything else is amazing. I recommend any of their chicken or beef dishes personally (Orange Beef is my favorite) and the Crab Wantons. So if you want fast awesome Asian food but sick of Panda Express, go check out Wang's Express."}
{"text":"Really tasty Chinese food at a low price. And fast!"}
{"text":"Wang Express is Chinese fast food.  It works in a pinch and doesn't taste all that bad.  I am not crazy about the chicken they use, seems to have quite a few chewy pieces.  The beef is a bit better.  Bottom line is that this place is close by and has edible food.  Certainly not the greatest nor the worst."}
{"text":"I stopped in for dinner one night.  I ordered the Mandarin Hot Chicken combo with rice, egg roll and won ton. The chicken was breaded and had a red, slightly spicy sauce.  The chicken was cooked well and the rice, egg roll and won ton were typical of most Chinese restaurants.  I look forward to returning to try more and give a more thorough review."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out, and it was fast and fresh. House special chicken is battered chicken with a brown sauce. It was tender, juicy and was a huge portion. The house fried rice had shrimp, beef, and chicken. And lastly, the snow peas beef was fantastic. The beef was so tender and the peas and bamboo shoots made for a great combination. My only complaint was that everything needed extra soy sauce."}
{"text":"For Chinese take out, the food was fresh and fast. Thanks for the smiles, and quick service."}
{"text":"Yuck! Took 2 bites and threw it away. The WORST food I have ever had. I don't know how they can call it Chinese at all."}
{"text":"This place is my Favorite!! Anything from Orange Chicken to Shrimp Lo mein and all of it is amazing! Don't forget Crab Angels ;)"}
{"text":"BY FAR, HANDS DOWN, THE WORST CHINESE FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.  I wish I were joking.  I ordered the usual, chicken with vegetables.  It was taking a long time so I peeked back behind the window.  The \"cook\", if you want to call him that, was just goofin off.  then he casually starts to throw everything in the pan.  It was awful.  Undercooked everything.  tough to chew.  obviously, it is a health hazard to undercook chicken.

the bathrooms were disgusting too.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS DUMP."}
{"text":"First time coming here, And we were very satisfied. 
My mother and i came here for a quick lunch! We walked in, we were greeted by a very friendly staff member, she took our order.**EVERYTHING IS MADE TO ORDER*** We ordered 2 Kung Pau chicken lunch specials and a large hot and sour soup, the soup came out very PROMPTLY not only that but the lady offered to serve us our soup the hospitality is amazing for it to be a fast food Chinese place. Very hot and very very delicious! LARGE HOT AND SOUR SOUP FOR ONLY $4.45!!!! Right after we finished the lady brought us our food, opened up the container, and WOW LARGE portions i got my kung pau chicken which was very fresh and it was authentic Chinese food. Fried rice was hot and authentic. the Spring roll was SOOO HOT (unlike other places **cough panda cough** where they just sit there until there all gone to make more) amazing tasting especially with the sauce they give you! fried wonton! Cheap drinks too! usually i don't get a drink because it always like 3 dollars but there drinks were like a dollar something. 
I STILL HAD LEFT OVERS AND I ATE THEM THE NEXT DAY FOR LUNCH AND IT WAS EVEN TASTIER! 
BEST HOLE IN THE WALL CHINESE PLACE!! 
i have to say..... WANG'S EXPRESS OVER panda express, or any other \"fast food\" Chinese  :) 

ONLY NEGATIVE THING IS it looks a little run down but IT SMELLS and LOOKS clean! come HERE they deserve to upgrade there amazing restaurant!"}
{"text":"We've been coming to Wangs for 25 years and its always been consistent until now. It's a Christmas Eve tradition but this year sadly will be the last.

We ordered multiple entrees and the chicken and pork were grisly, chewy and unappetizing. Eggrolls aren't as good as they used to be and rice was dry and obviously reheated. The interior of the restaurant was messy, dirty and low lit. Either the ownership has changed or they're trying to cut down on food costs. Avoid."}
{"text":"The customer service is excellent. They double checked my order in front of me and made sure they had my order right before I left.
The food is outstanding 
This place is a hidden gem
No need to go anywhere else!
Orange chicken, sweet & sour chicken, teriyaki chicken, and Beef Broccoli are amazing!
Will be coming back soon"}
{"text":"It's ok food. I had the chow mein and the noodles were mushy. My daughter had chicken and vegetables which was just ok. There wasn't a ton of flavor to our food. The egg rolls had a weird taste but I loved the sweet and sour sauce. 

I give this three stars because the vegetables were good and the portions were decent sized but I probably won't be back. We thought we would try somewhere new but I was not impressed"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food (it doesn't even deserve to be called food) I have EVER had in my life! Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Don't eat here. I had the curry chicken. It was fried and made with dark meat. Curry sauce was not good either. Kind of dirty inside the restaurant, very outdated. Seems like the workers are lazy."}
{"text":"I ordered a take out and its my second time first time I had a garlic chicken and second time I went with vegetable chicken that was very tasty the meat is all  white and the portions are huge. The staff is very friendly. One of the best Chinese food."}
{"text":"Great food, fast and polite service. Great place to stop for a quick bite or take out."}
{"text":"When you want a little wang in your mouth, this place should do it.  Quick, tasty, cheap Chinese is their speciality, and you can find some kickin' lunch specials here too.  I'm a sucker for a crispy egg roll, and Wang has a great one.  

Wang's a good option when you're on the go, but don't want to sink to the level of Mcdonald's or Burger King. It's not the best Chinese you'll ever have, but it'll do.  So everybody have fun tonight.  Everybody wang chung tonight."}
{"text":"Just moved to Tatum & Bell area from Raintree & 101 area so we needed a new place for Chiniese food because we no longer live by Pei Wei on Raintree. So searched yelp for Chiniese close by and found good reviews for this Wangs place. So gave it a try yesterday, we ordered Sesame Chicken / Orange Chicken / Pepper Steak / and Crab Angels. Everything was TERRIBLE. Sesame Chicken was soggy with all the breading falling off of it. Orange Chicken was bland at best. My girls pepper steak order had no flavor at ALL. Tasted like they just boiled the steak in water and served it to us. The Crab Angels were the best part of my $32.00 order, and even those weren't that good. I usually don't even leave reviews but I had to because my girlfriend and I are completely baffled as to how this place has 4 out of 5 stars in the reviews on Yelp. Only good part of me dining here was friendly Staff & food was all done within 10 min of me ordering. If the owner can read this review you really need new cooks or your doors will be closed sooner then later.  Final thought   Pros-  Very friendly customer service & food was ready super fast.  Cons -  seriously the WORST CHINIESE FOOD I've had in the 5 years that I've lived in Arizona. Needless to say I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Great takeout Chinese!! Way cheaper than PF Changs, Better portions than Panda Express and tastes better than Pei Wei!! It's cheap and the service is great. They make wonderful Cashew Chicken and their Walnut Shrimp is great too!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for 15 years or more. I order the Sweet n Sour Chicken and Crab Puffs every time. I've never experienced poor service either. Large portions for not a lot of money, and it's fresh too."}
{"text":"My go to place. Good stuff. Fast and friendly. Food is good quality for a quicky joint. The interior is actually pretty spartan. I always order take out."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from here for 10 plus years now. Friendly service and amazing food. No ones orange chicken is better than theirs, their egg drop soup is perfect for when you're sick or it's a rainy day. I got lazy one day when I wanted Chinese food and ordered from somewhere else that delivered, NEVER AGAIN! Driving to Wang's to pick up your food is 100% worth it!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food fast friendly service and clean we will be back.  Ate in tables outside to eat on nice day. So nice!"}
{"text":"Stop going to Panda Express. This place is bomb. I love their food. And they are pretty fast at making it. It's kinda well hidden in the corner of a Walmart shopping center but those hole in the wall restaurants are usually a hidden jewel like this one. I come here every so often and I haven't had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Not too sure why there are so many bad reviews...keep in mind this is Chinese Fast Food, not a fancy restaurant.  The prices are good.  The fried food is light and crisp.  There could be more vegetables in some of the servings, but overall not a bad little place.  The food was hot and fresh and came out quickly."}
{"text":"Something has changed. As in  the cook isn't a cook.  Shrimp with lobster Sauce was salty beyond words. Like someone through some soy sauce and salt in a pan. HORRIBLE.  I've been getting this at this place for well over 10 years...  It is certainly the LOST time I eat here.  Terrible."}
{"text":"Only ever ordered to go, but the speed is great and the Orange Chicken is one of our favorite! No delivery option which is unfortunate, and the restaurant itself isn't that clean or welcoming, but for a good tasting place down the street, it's a place we get often."}
{"text":"Good food, haven't found a asian restaurant that wasn't overkill on grease in a very long time and I was pleasantly surprised with their food, not greasy, egg drop soup was awesome! They even have the little crispies to put into the soup which again is hard to come by these days!  So far so great! :)"}
{"text":"Great Chinese fast food, order the house special fried rice, house special chicken and the house special lo mein, these are the main items that are pretty authentic chinese food. they are pretty quick and the food is always good to take home. don't go to the white man's buffet when you can get good quality fresh authentic chinese food."}
{"text":"First place we found that wasn't closed on Christmas Day. 

It's your standard mom & pop American-Chinese joint. They're running a very....uh....loosely knit ship. Cash register wasn't working properly, and they're writing down our orders on paper. I'm ambivalent as to whether they would pass a full health inspection. 

Sesame chicken - generic trash
Hot mandarin beef - generic trash
House fried rice - The meat is in chunks that are too big for a fried rice, imho. A ton of soy sauce, etc. Veggies are probably frozen. Tastes just like you expect bad Chinese express fried rice to taste. 

It's really not that bad. It's just.....normal bad."}
