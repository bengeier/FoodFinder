{"text":"This is the BEST PIZZA ever;). Couple of my Friends had told me about Nonno Crupi's and we decided to try it and now this  is our 'Friday Night' dinner...every time we order it never disappoints!!!  Can't wait to try their veal Parmesan sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"I really like Crupi's pizza! I've had it several times and I'm always happy with it.  Thin slice Italian style pizza. Great toppings. Reasonably priced.  There isn't much parking out front but I've parked in the plaza on the side to pickup my pizza!  Definitely better than any pizza chains!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in all of the city. Wish they had more locations their pizza is amazing and so is their panzerotti. The most delicious around. Hard to find pizza places that are authentic and have top notch quality. Always go there when I'm in the area. More then 5 stars in my opinion."}
{"text":"First time here and it did not disappoint.  The owner was super nice and the pizza is amazing. Definitely worth paying the extra few bucks. Thin and crispy thin crust, lots of fresh toppings and not greasy. It was totally worth the drive up there. 100% recommend this pizza joint."}
{"text":"A local favourite. Excellent pizza at a pretty good price. When you have Italian friends that only eat pasta and pizza made at home who say this pizza is really good, then you know it is great."}
{"text":"This is a local pizza joint for me and it took me a while to check it out but I was pleasantly surprised. They are a little pricey but they were willing to make any combination we suggested and managed to nail it. They are a little difficult to get a hold of on the phone at times so not always convenient. I will be back regularly as long as they keep answering the phone..."}
{"text":"It's an okay mom and pop pizzeria. We ordered two large pizzas. One was chicken, tomatoes, pineapples. The other one was pepperoni, green peppers and mushrooms. The crust was good but the inside was a little too mushy for our liking.  The sauce was okay at best. It was free delivery which is a plus."}
{"text":"I used to go to Crupis pizza in Markham back in the day before it closed down. I was so excited to try this pizza out when I heard there was still a Crupis pizza around, wow was the pizza ever good, great quality toppings with a delicious pizza sauce, Yum!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to eat, the service was great and friendly, and the pizza was really good and pretty well priced, they also have a selection of other things like chicken wings which are also really good and pretty well priced as well. Can't go wrong with eating here."}
{"text":"Luv this place. A local favourite.  Pizza is fresh and veal sandwich are awesome.   Pizza slice is well priced and my fave!"}
{"text":"This place nailed it. One of the better veal sandwiches I've had. Firstly the bread they use is fantastic. Perfectly soft and toasted. And did I say it was huge!  Veal - very generous portion of meat. I see a lot of places that cheap out on the meat. Not this place. Well breaded, deliciously seasoned and generous.   Great tasting sauce that's not too acidic. Overall a great tasting sandwich."}
{"text":"I got to admit that it wasn't the pizza that drew me to this tiny establishment in the middle of nowhere just off the side of the road. Rather, it was their large sign for veal on a bun and my ever increasing hunger. Thankfully, all the patrons before me ordered pizza so I changed my mind and got a slice of pizza instead. Good thing because it was absolutely delicious!!  Throughout the meal, there was a steady stream of hungry people ordering their own perfect slice so you know you've made a good life decision.  The pizza itself is pretty perfect. The crust was thin, crisp, and solid enough to carry all the fresh toppings and tangy sauce. Heated up to order, it comes piping hot and the cheese melted all over. You can even get your piece 'well done' if you like it on the crispier side. A great meal to satisfy any hunger pangs or a snack during a long trip up north."}
{"text":"Just had a quick lunch there today. Lets start with the service - Very Friendly, cheerful and quick. I ordered a veal on a bun which was quite good and reasonable in price.   They have pizza and meatball sandwiches as well. The decor is just very simple. It has four or five tables inside and they have two picnic tables outside. It is set up kind of like a little sandwich shop.   I would recommend this place for the veal on a bun."}
{"text":"Nonno Crupi's Pizza used to be in Markham before the moved up to North Stouffiville. So being the only decent non chain pizza joint in the area, I totally understand the high rating as a local neighbourhood place.  No frills, good ingredients, friendly service.  Dropping by here after servicing my car for lunch one afternoon. A lot of truckers popped in for take out or eat in. Parking for sure can be a challenge in this small parking lot so a lot of people just park in roadside or wherever space without blocking others.  My Deluxe Pizza Slice is A-OK. It is usually hard to rate a pizza if it is not fresh from the oven. But at least Nonno Crupi's has a high turnover so it was still good.  Worth supporting local small business if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I been eating crupis pizza since the first location in Markham best pizza hands down for over 20 Years Tony makes it how MR. Crupi made it"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. It's a bit out of the way for me but well worth the drive. Crust is fluffy and decent amount of toppings; reasonable price."}
{"text":"Great pizza made in the traditional fashion. Their hours are a little strange so make sure they are open if you're just dropping by to get something."}
