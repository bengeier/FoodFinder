{"text":"Ma famille et moi sommes allée au Dilallo Sté-Catherine et avons adorée ce restaurant! Le service est excellant, la nourriture très bonne et la commande arrive très vite! Ils ont des menus pour enfant ce que j'ai vraiment apprécier et ils offrent même de délicieuses salades! La place est impeccable, très propre et le décor très jolie. Beau, bon, pas cher!"}
{"text":"One of the best old school burger in Montreal.  Let's say i didn't expext much from the place. It's not fancy but their burgers are so good that I don't care. The service is fast and efficient.  Price is good.  You can ask for the peppers on the side if you don't want them in the burger. Totally would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The burgers are as good as one could hope for the price and the setting sure makes for good conversation. I like the fact that it's not a chain fast food place, but its missing some beer variety (i.e. other than Molson/Labbatt) and the fries could really be improved.  Edit 2015: The decor has been revamped, without losing the more memorable parts and the fries are much better. Great all around!"}
{"text":"Excellents burgers ! Le décor de l'endroit est plutôt fonctionnel, sans plus. Mais c'est vrai qu'ici on ne vient pas pour le décor."}
{"text":"Best burger money can buy. The staff is amazing and they deliver. If you you've never had Dilallo's before you owe it to yourself to give it a shot."}
{"text":"Qui connaît pas Dilallo, manque quelque chose. J'étais jeune quand Meloche a ouvert sa succursale à St-Henri. Ce même restaurant est toujours en place depuis 40ans peut-être plus. Une telle renommée se bâtit par une constance, et encore et toujours les hamburgers sont les meilleurs."}
{"text":"This is a classic burgers and fries joint but with deep rooted history in the area. Both Ville Emard boys Mad Dog Vachon and Mario Lemieux and family would frequent this place and it is evident by the decor inside. Granted the place went through a facelift recently and shed it's dozen upon dozens sports memorabilia and autographed pictures plastered all over the walls but the new look does it justice, maintains some of the old charm mixed in with a new updated look and is perfectly welcoming to neighbourhood families and travelling foodies.   Order a buck burger, with a side of fries and beer on tap and I guarantee you will be lusting to come back !"}
{"text":"À mon avis,,,, c'est les meilleurs Hamburgers que j'ai  mangé à vie!!!! En plus c'est l'original!!! Tu peut pas te tromper.... la décoration, très Nice!  L'essayer, c'est l'adopter"}
{"text":"Je n'aime pas la relish et la moutarde, mais il n'y a que Dilallo pour me faire manger un hamburger comme ça. Sans compter que je ne mange presque jamais de burger dans les restaurant non franchisé par peur de la mauvaise qualité de la viande haché.  Le restaurant rencontre mon 1er critère, ça goûte la bouffe maison. La poutine est très acceptable.   Ils ont refait la décor, ça fait moins cafétéria.  I'm a fan for 20 years."}
{"text":"Two words! Boc burger! This burger is the real deal. Tender meat, hot peppers, capicollo. You can have it wet, or dry. Where they soak your bread in the burger and pepper juice.  When craving a \"real\" burger head on down and order this delicious burger."}
{"text":"Living in Denver CO I don't get to Montreal/Laval as often as I would like but when I do I have to get my Buck Burger fix.  To my taste it has to be the best  burger on the planet. I was once told by a franchise owner that they use 1/3 each of ground veal, pork and beef to make the patty. That was later denied by another manager that it was simply beef.  The first guy even showed me an instrument used to measure the meat for consistency.  Whatever the truth is, it is in my opinion the King of All Burgers!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place!  My family worked there before I was born and everyone still goes and eats there.  The owners are super friendly and they take real pride in what they do.  They have pictures everywhere up on the wall with famous people it's great gives you something to look at or even to spot someone :)  Burgers poutine beer is the best from this spot"}
{"text":"We got 2 Buck burger trios with onion rings. The onion rings were standard, which was kind of expected, but after the reviews on this site I honestly expected the burgers to be amazing and we were greatly dissappointed. One of the burgers had clearly rotting brown lettuce which my dining partner is currently throwing up into the toilet as i type this.  The other burger I paid 50 cents to substitue \"fried onions\" instead of raw ones, and the fried onions were a disgusting soggy mess dripping with that transluscent oil/grease but the onions were still raw.  The burger itself was ok but we got the bread dipped in hot peppers and it was a bit much combined with all the other stuff on the burger.  All in all I don't think this place deserves the high ratings it's received.  Sure, it's better than McDonald's, but my 20$ could have better been spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"I always order there when I want to eat a good burger & have it in a timely fashion. They always delivers super fast & the food is always good. When I go go to the restaurant itself: i like the ambiance & the staff is always nice. I've been going there for 10 years now since I was in elementary school & my favourite waitress is still there & she still knows my regular order."}
{"text":"Burgers are delicious! Their fries remind me of my childhood summers. The staff was also very friendly."}
{"text":"Very good burgers very clean professional place always good when we go eat there there's a bit of parking it's refreshing to eat a good hamburger"}
{"text":"Think Five Guys but better.  If you're looking for a hefty burger - but tired of same old - presented simply and tastefully, this is the place for you!  You can find the place either on the South-Shore or Montreal. Personally I went for the short to check out the \"fine dining\" experience.  Things get fantastic especially if you go for the buck burger that includes perfect banana spicy peppers. The name comes from the fact that originally it was the first burger that costed a buck (remember, this place dates backs from 1929).  Again... the combination is just perfect between spicy and tastefull.  The place is simple, no trays or plates, the burgers are straight up served in paper raping and good to go if you wish to.  All and all a somewhat affordable (12 to 15 bucks for a standard trio) burger joint that will make you want to come again or simply, skip 5 guys and rally go for taste.  Five guys - Go back to work."}
{"text":"The Buck burger is one of the best burgers in the city. I really like the all new interior but I do miss the old place."}
{"text":"Ca devait faire une trentaine d'années que je n'avait mis les pieds dans ce restaurant. Je me demandais si mon hamburger était pour être l'ombre des bons souvenirs que j'avais dans ma mémoire. L'intérieur a été complètement rénové et des télés ont été ajoutées pour suivre les sports. C'est devenu un bar sportif. J'ai commandé un hamburger au bacon et fromage avec rondelles d'oignons. Le hamburger était juteux, délicieux comme à la maison. Belle boulettes de viande de buf frais avec une belle tranche d'oignons entre le fromage et le bacon. Pour ce qui est des rondelles d'oignons au lieu des frites j'en ai mangé de bien meilleures ailleurs.  Allez pour les frites à mon avis. Le service est très rapide et des que vous êtes servis, l'addition est mise sur la fable pour aller payer rapidement au comptoir avant de retourner au bureau. J'y retourne sûrement bientôt."}
{"text":"Whaaaaaaaat?!?! Delivery both times I've ordered here took 16 minutes and 20 minutes respectively. 5 stars for delivery.  - The poutine: perfection. 5 stars. Brown tasty gravy that I love! Will hafta ask for extra next time cuz i like my poutine soupy lol. Perfect cheese curds, perfect fries. A medium is 7.75 and perfect side dish portion for 2-3 ppl.   - The cheeseburgers: 3 stars. Great taste, great size/portion, ok toppings. I hate that the damn things fall apart...literally crumble outta the burger onto the plate. They need to fix this. For 5.15 per burger I expect it to stay relatively together while I'm eating it. I also hate that they put a full huge onion slice with all its rings still glued together...its just too much onion, chop it up or separate the rings and only put 3-4 rings not the full slice.   I am sooooo glad that I found out they deliver (By searching \"poutine delivery\" on Yelp BTW). They have won my business as a regular and despite the crumbly burgers, I will keep makin that ritual order here cuz of the poutine!!"}
{"text":"Buck burger is the way to go - capicola, pickled peppers. Numlicious! Ordered the black cherry and a \"small\" fries (I had plenty of leftover fries!)."}
{"text":"I had been told for years about Dilallo. How it was the place to go for your post-drinking meal on a Saturday night, or the place to go if you are working the graveyard shift.   Recently a new location opened up in my neck of the woods - ie: South Shore, and I decided to try the place out.   I am so happy to have found a burger joint that ...wait for it...wait for it..SELLS BURGERS! Yes, you can get a real burger here - no Kobe beef, 10yr old aged cheddar or truffles. It's a meat in your mouth, grease on your hands type of meal!  My wife and I both decided to try a burger & poutine. She went with a regular poutine, I opted for one with Italian sausage and pepperoni. They should rename the one I had to the Meat Feast! It's so goood.   The burgers are equally great. Nicely cooked patty, a great bun and just the right amount of flavour."}
{"text":"How is this place not rated higher?  What a fantastic burger. I've heard about this place for years from various people and I finally got the opportunity to go over the holidays.   Ordered the special burger trio and the burger was superb. Had it dry (my waitress never asked) and I think I'd try it wet next time. It sounds kinda gross so it must be good. I got the fries too but they weren't too memorable after only a few weeks from trying them.  The star of this burger is the patty. It's the equivalent to my girlfriend's grandfathers' patty; very soft in texture, breaks apart easily, and has a creamy, velvety texture (weird, I know).  It's a patty that's far superior to other fast food joints, hence the 5 stars. Next time I go, I'm definitely doing two burgers and skipping the fries.  If you're in the area, you gotta go."}
{"text":"Mmmm who doesn't like greasy old school burgers?? Great spot when you need to have a cheat meal. I did take out which was fast and efficient. Just sucks that at the time of this review Allard Street is being torn apart.   Good fries too!"}
{"text":"Not quite the original, but almost.  As the name suggests, the original Dilallo burger was started by Papa Luigi Dilalo back in 1929, but it didn't get started in this exact location.  They had to move down the block in 1967 to make way for the Metro.  So the structure is 1960s vintage, and the interior is 1980s vintage.  Still, this is one of Montreal's great shrines.  Dilallo isn't the only Montreal establishment that's festooned its walls with tributes to the Habs and the Als, but how many places can you name that also celebrate Mario \"Le Magnifique\" Lemieux and Maurice \"Mad Dog\" Vachon, as well as Hank \"Tony Angelo\" Pardi and the infamous 1973-4 Ville-Émard Pussycats?  And they've been making one of Montreal's wickedest burgers for over 80 years now.  My favorite is the Buck Burger, with capicolla and hot peppers.  The price has gone up a little since they first named it, but it's still just as unique as ever."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need a little grease in your life.  I admit I've been a little slow to discovering this Montreal institution, and while other establishments are considered montreal landmarks now, like Schwartz's, Montreal Pool Room, St. Viateur Bagel and the Orange Julep, Dilallo Burger definitely needs to join that list. They have been serving burgers continuously now since 1929 and with an 80+ year history, that's nothing to sneeze at.  Located a few blocks away from Monk metro station, Dilallo Burger easily serves up the best fast-food version of the burger and can easily compete  with Five Guys, hands down for best fast-food burger in town. Don't bother getting anything else but the Buck Burger which comes with capicolla and hot peppers. Bacon is extra. You can ask for a \"Wet\" Burger (some of the meat juices are allowed to percolate into the bread), \"Dipped\" (some of the hot pepper juice) or \"Dry\" (none of the above). Fries and onion rings are nothing to write home about, but the burger is the reason why you come here.   Unless of course you're a crazy NHL fan. Mario Lemieux and many other NHL heavyweights have links to Dilallo Burger, as evidenced by the walls which are literally covered with newspaper clippings, posters, pictures of Dilallo's connection to sports and local celebrities over the past 80 years.  This is a great spot to hit either before a movie at Place Angrignon or to come by after your kids game."}
{"text":"Dilallo is a great burger joint for your quick fix. Unlike Belpro's, you can expect a tasty burger that isn't too greasy. The service is quick & simple just like the food. Though it didn't blow me away, the food was a good value and portion. I left satisfied. Additionally, I can't ignore the staff being very friendly & hospitable.  Bottom line: I won't go out of my way to get myself or others to a Dilallo, but I mark it down as a \"safe bet\" if ever the option comes up again."}
{"text":"Pattie was not juicy.onion rings were descent. You can totally find a better burger easily in downtown montreal."}
{"text":"Je m'attendais à un bon burger avec toutes les commentaires du site. Malheureusement, le burger était quelconque et fade. La boulette est sans saveur. Il est super facile de trouver mieux ailleurs en ville. Très décevant."}
{"text":"A great Montreal classic. I love coming here to get a Buck Burger and watch the hockey game. There is great memorabilia on the walls."}
{"text":"If you want a real burger without the overpriced filler this is the place to go when in these neck of the woods. I always go with the Buck Burger combo. A real meat patty with all the right fixings. My wife enjoys their regular poutine and the fries alone are great too. If you have kids like me you cannot go wrong in picking up the kids burger combo with juice box."}
{"text":"Fait plusieurs fois que je vais au dilalo la jai était avec ma famille à l'heure du midi très bon service rapide la serveuse était très gentille  Nous avons pris pour 6 personnes   3 Buck burgers  2 burger all-dressed  1 burger capicolo  4 frites 1 frites sauce 1 Poutine régulière  Avec 4 cokes 2 bière en fût   Rien a dire a part que s'était très bon et savoureux"}
