{"text":"My wife and I were traveling to Cave Creek and were drawn in by a sign reading 'Butterburgers' which I certainly thought was 'Butterbeer,' until I realized that we were in Phoenix, not Hogsmeade. But when one is brave enough to advertise butter and burgers not only together in a sentence, but in a WORD, the gauntlet is thus thrown down and one (another one), must pick it up--or whatever one does with a gauntlet.  I'll be damned if the burgers were not buttery, but in a good way. Fries were crispy and crinkly, harkening back to time spent as a lad at the late great freestanding Foster's Freeze. The novelty of the butterburger compelled me to even challenge my fondness for In-n-Out. The malt was malty--even maltese, if you please the food was salty with just a hint of greaze (bad spelling, good rhyming).  The manager was very friendly and hovered over my wife like a Coast Guard rescue copter. All in all, a top notch dining experience that had us filled for quite a spell."}
{"text":"Most awesome, this locations drive through menu is horrendous lacks a lot of the menu items. So you would either have a good memory or not get to know all their yummy items, I'm thinking the owner is cheap to offer a better menu board to order from."}
{"text":"It's fast food but it actually tastes good. Chicken strips are juicy, not dried out like everywhere else. Menu board is a little intimidating. A couple of times I've experienced a slightly distracted order taker but other than that, staff is pretty friendly and chocolate malts are great."}
{"text":"As much as we really enjoy the food here, this location is actually quite repulsive! Watching employees \"wipe\" the tables off with their hands instead of sanitized rags and smelling mop water that reeks of sewage really is a turn off. Love what Culver's is all about and the food but it would be nice to see them clean up their act...no pun intended!"}
{"text":"Been to numerous Culver's in SD, KY, TX. This one is our favorite.  Almost every Wednesday evening we have a relaxing family meal."}
{"text":"We love this Culvers! We are here several times a month for dinner or ice cream. We absolutely love that they keep dog treats in the drive thru for our puppy- one of the reasons we can justify more ice cream trips! :)"}
{"text":"Whatza Culvers?   I drove by this place as it was being built; didn't know what it was, but \"butterburger\" and \"frozen yogurt\" caught my eye..... so I decided to visit it on 2011-05-30 (dine-in).  Looks like it just opened, and it was busy. Turns out this place is a fast-food chain based out of Wisconsin that I had never heard of before... kind of like a cross between an In-and-Out and a Dairy Queen.  Menu is a bit daunting the first time - a burger or a sandwich?  what side?  smoothies, or regular drinks?  You walk up to the counter, place your order, take your number to your table, and they deliver your order to your table when it's ready. The burger patties are different... they're about 1/8\" thick and seem pressed/fried.  The buns are nice and soft... ingredients are fresh or properly cooked.  Flavors are there... but it is a different style burger than what we're used to seeing.  I tried the cheese curds; just wish they hadn't breaded/deep-fried them.  I like my curds natural.  A fountain drink completes the \"value basket\" deal. Their frozen yogurt or \"concrete mix\" sealed the deal.... we tried the banana split (nice) and their \"brownie cookie dough\".  Kinda hard to screw up frozen yogurt!  yum!  Okay, so I now know what a Culvers is.  It's a good change-of-pace from the other fast food chains.  Not sure I'd go out of my way just to come here (unless I'm really in the mood for it).   I'll have to try other items, but for now, its a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"I would actually say about 3.5 ... But since they did a fundraiser for my son's school, I bumped them up.   The good: selection! I had a cod sandwich, big and juicy, could have done without the cheese and it needed more tarter. It was a large, full piece if fish. The onion rings - large, I would consider the breading 'medium' thickness. I love onion rings, and these are better than any other fast food joint.  The negatives: my son got the bacon burger, thin and dry. French fries sucked.   Now this place is suppose to have good ice cream - and if you know me - you know I eat ice cream almost daily. I have say - average. In fact, I think I would prefer DQ, especially for the price.  Finally - this place is expensive for fast food. Bacon burger, fries, softdrink, cod sandwich and onion rings - $14.00...I think I can find healthier options for about the same price and speed."}
{"text":"Horrible! Dry and flavorless. We got the pub burger, the Reuben, and a BBQ bacon burger. All three were terrible. Onion rings, blah. Cheese curds, gross. French fries, soggy. The worst fast food ever. Never going back"}
{"text":"Came to celebrate my son's team's basketball win.  They have 3 TV's here but none of them on with Diamondback's playing and NBA playoffs tonight? I asked a crew member if the tv's worked? They said yes so I asked for the basketball game to be turned on. So instead the manager comes out and turns on the baseball game. I went back to the counter and asked a crew member if I could borrow the remote to change it to the basketball game and the manager says \"I'm a little busy right now but maybe later\"! Too busy to hand me the remote which was in plain sight on the back counter?  We placed our order 8:22pm. Our malts finally came out at 8:46 after we were completely done with our food.  The kids working here are friendly and working hard. Too bad they are saddled with a poor leader who doesn't care about customer service and has lost control of his kitchen."}
{"text":"The food is way too expensive two burgers fries and milkshakes $25.00 for just mediocre thin patty burgers and wrinkle fries"}
{"text":"Service is predominantly teenagers who don't appear to want to work. Long time to order, long time for food. Stale bread and fries reminiscent of grade school cafeteria. Not worth $6 pass"}
{"text":"Yeah, the butter burgers are great, but that is just the beginning. The onion rings are Fabulous! The concrete mixers have many more options that Dairy Queen, the side salads are worth a mention for the healthy alternative. They even have green beans as a side dish. OK, it is fast food, but good fast food that does not taste processed. (McDonald's and Burger King)  It is as good at is gets for taste, value and menu. There is not a more robust fast food offering that I am aware of."}
{"text":"The meat tasted and looked weird,and a little burnt, the only thing I like from the place was the onion rings . 10/10 would not eat there again"}
{"text":"We live close by and its the only food spot close traveling North on Cave Creek that kids like. Their kids burgers have literally nothing in them, besides a meat patty and 2 buns... the kids were like \" Wheres our lettuce and tomatoes, mama?\" The regular burgers are greasy because the bread gets buttered up. If you are really starving you can stop by, otherwise dont waist your calories and appetite on this!"}
{"text":"Ate here numerous times and food has been fresh, tasty and relatively cheap everytime.  Much prefer this place over in and out/five guys"}
{"text":"I took my family here after months of driving past it every day, and we have come back regularly ever since. Culvers is like a Dairy Queen, except that the food is good.   The butterburgers are very good. I cannot think of a better fast-food burger, except possibly Lenny's.  The thick, crinkle-cut fries are delicious as well. They have a fairly large selection of dessert items - much more than most fast-food chains. My only disappointment was the cod filet. It was far too greasy for my taste.   This location is very clean and seems to be run by people of higher intelligence than a typical fast-food place (Wendy's is the worst in this department). The staff is consistently friendly and efficient.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Still a bit confused how to place an order for what I want.   I like their burgers, although in my online survey they were near the top in the most total fat contest, the Whopper was worse. I don't eat at McFakeburger so I didnt look on their web site. FYI the lowest total fat burger last time I looked was In & Out and in 2nd place was Wendy's. This is for a single patty with no cheese.  So I get their Butter Burger but add deluxe toppings. And I like their fries too. Their coleslaw is a bit poor... Need to try their green bean side dish. In fact some of their other sandwiches look tempting as well.  As always, the place is spotless. Looks like it was just professionally scrubbed down from top to bottom. Counter service is above average. Be on guard for up-selling at the register.  Parking is plentiful, enter the lot from any direction off Rose Garden or northbound on Cave Creek.  So if this is your first time you walk-in, decide what to order on the big order board, place your order and pay. You are handed an empty cup and a plastic table marker sign. Get your drink and have a seat and place your number table sign where it can be seen and wait for food to be delivered to your table. If you want carry-out you can either stand and wait near the order area or have a seat and wait. It takes them about 5 minutes to crank out a burger and fries. So get yourself a cup of ketchup and some napkins and sit and watch ESPN while you are waiting.  Probably a good idea to research their menu online before heading to Culver's."}
{"text":"This place takes fast food to a new level! The staff is wonderful at this location!   It was one of those, I may just die if I have to cook dinner kinda nights... They are just up the street and have veggie burgers and grilled cheese for us non carnivorous folk.. And ice cream... Enough said!   There was not much of a line, we ordered took our number and sat down. They promptly brought our food to our table. The guy was so friendly, not the no eye contact here's your food type stuff you get at other fast food places.   We ate and went back for ice cream. This place is as unhealthy as they come. But it's fast and easy.. Like all places I wish they had more nutritious opinions and we would go more. But it's fast junk and sometimes that's just the case."}
{"text":"A good place for bugers and fries."}
{"text":"Unfortunately not good!! Today's visit was the last visit. Just not impressed with how greasy the beef is. Other dishes are ok nothing impressive enough for the price charged. Well... I do like the custard so it might not be the last time."}
{"text":"quick qualifier, I didn't choose to go here, the soccer team manager did... the whole soccer team went between tournament games at Reach 11.  Ok - first know that at Culvers you're getting fairly greasy fast food type stuff  like burgers & fries.  They are known for their burgers & custard.  Didn't have either of those  but my sons gave the burgers a 3.5.  Fries were krinkle cut, very average.  I had the Reuben, pretty good, but the sauerkraut was pretty bland. Probably  the healthiest sandwich on the menu besides the grilled chicken.  Unlike McD's, they have competent people who work there.   And I like that they bring your order to your table, so you're not stumbling around waiting by the counter.  So definitely a step above all the big fast food chains with prices that are just a tad (I think...) more."}
{"text":"Ordered a Pork Tenderloin but was brought a Cod sandwich.  Told the delivery person I ordered a Pork Tenderloin.  They looked at me funny and walked away.  About 10 minutes later another staff person walks up and asks me how I wanted my Cod?!?  I said I did not order Cod, I ordered a Pork Tenderloin.  Finally, buy the time my lunch mate was almost done eating, I was brought the sandwich I ordered.  After all that, it had nothing on it.  The picture on the menu shows the Tenderloin served with onion, pickles, mustard, & ketchup.  The sandwich was served to me plain. To top it all off, they charged me for the Cod, which was more than the Tenderloin, but never offered to refund the difference. I had to make an extra trip up to the counter to get re-imbursed.  All in all, a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Here is the truth. My wife loves this place. It makes her happy. She likes their burgers and chicken sandwiches, She likes their cheese curds. She loves their frozen custard selection. Its expensive but we get it on occasions and its not the norm. the food is close to the price of a full service restaurant which is why its not getting 5 stars. Just remember happy wife = happy life."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I have waited 15+ minutes for a scoop of ice cream. I've watched meal after meal come out and not one employee has come to my car to see what I am waiting on. I think it is safe to say that I will no longer be a customer of Culver's."}
{"text":"So tonight during a custard run, I witnessed the general manager taking his frustration out on an employee by yelling and dropping the f-bomb within earshot of dozens of other patrons to include many families with children. It was disgusting and completely inexcusable.  When I asked to speak with the manager to discuss how unhappy I was, he refused to see me. I waited 10 minutes while my custard melted and he still wouldn't come out. Shame on the manager for not keeping your cool. You can't be a leader if you can't keep your cool. I'm not surprised if you have employees that aren't up to par. I wouldn't be motivated to work hard for a man who yells and curses at me."}
{"text":"Food is great!  However, very frustrating to drive away only to find a mistake with order. Something wrong nearly every time lately it seems. Wake up!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our nice cool treat at Culver's!  This was my first time at this restaurant.  I must say, the ice cream is very creamy!!! YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Oreo milkshake and chocolate malt shake and didn't even end up getting it.i was waiting on the shakes in drive thru 2 cars got their food and shakes before me,so I went inside to find out someone cleared my order and they never got it.while I'm waiting there for over 20min none  of the workers came up to me or anything and asked what's going on.the older guy who took my order said just grab 2 ice creams any kind.first time going there and all I wanted was a shake and they couldn't even do that.never going to that one again.what a waste of money!"}
{"text":"They were better in the past, but they've gone downhill lately. While they've always been pretty slow, they used to get the orders correct. Last time we ordered they left parts of two different meals out. I drove back to get the missing items and they still missed something. They sent a free meal certificate. Fine and good. Then we went to use the free meal. They got two items wrong, again. Plus we had to repeat our order three times, just to get it wrong anyway. Why bother calling again. We may go there for an occasional ice cream treat, but nothing else. Too bad since it's really close to us and kid activites."}
{"text":"Does anyone try in this state anymore? They couldn't even get the ice cream right and thats what you do. The burger was awful and wrong. They even took the whole order back and still messed it up. Not a single manager to be found."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go celebrate a personal achievement with ice cream.  Showed up at 7:45 pm to order a vanilla sundae with raspberries, and a concrete mixer with snickers and heath.  We get our order at 8:00 pm.  I take one bite and realize there are no raspberries only the raspberry juices my custard is swimming.  I go to the counter to have them remake it and suggest they give me plain vanilla custard... They assure me that they have raspberries and they don't know what happened.  I wait 10 minutes.  In this time period 4 people ask me if I have been taken care of which was nice and I thought I was until I realized nobody was remaking my sundae.  I ask about it... And they come back with a raspberry concrete mixer (its now 8:15)...i ask for my money back which was done promptly and with an apology.  I get back to the table,  my husband is finished, but he says they forgot his heath bars in his concrete mixer.  We stopped coming here because we had so many wrong orders, but it's been a year and we thought it might be better.  Nope, won't be coming back.  Only saving grace is the kids they hire are very nice even if they dont know what they are doing (or haven't been trained well.)"}
{"text":"Never coming back to this location.... terrible... lady at the drive window was talking back to me as if I actually cared to argue... I said two double deluxe and two single deluxe with fries... (double means double patty, single means one) she argued that they're all butter burgers and plain. Bull crap... I said everything on them so everything needs to be on them... then I ask her if she has a Togo menu so I can show her and she says oh we don't have numbers for specific meals... Go to deer valley if you want to save your breath and get better assistance....  do not argue with your customers over a damn burger if you're wanting returning customers..."}
{"text":"Good burger!  The hubby had the mushroom swiss, the kids had plain cheeseburgers and I had the patty melt.  The food was good, the atmosphere family friendly and clean.  Overall, good."}
{"text":"Stopped in this location on Cave Creek rd this afternoon and placed an order inside and waited 20 minutes no food ! When asked about my order was told they had no idea what happened , so I just left frustrated !! Will never try and eat here again, poor customer service"}
{"text":"We went through the drive-thru at this Culver's several days ago.  We ordered two fish sandwiches, one french fry and two shakes.  The bill was $22.  Not cheap for fast food.  Also not very fast, we waited almost 10 minutes in the drive-thru for our meals.  The gave us our shakes while we waited, they were tasty except they only gave us straws and they were too thick to drink through a straw. We needed spoons.  When the food came we left.  One of the meals was for my mother-in-law, who is in hospice care. Unfortunately when we got to her home we discovered that they forgot to put the buns on the fish sandwiches.  I called them to complain.  They apologized and said they would send us 2 value meal coupons.  They never sent the coupons.  I will not return there, the service was horrible, the food was expensive and nobody really cared that they messed up the order.  They also did not send the coupons when they said they would."}
{"text":"Waited close to 15 minutes for a side salad and a kids meal.  I had to go and get it myself from the counter.  Huge crowd of people at the counter, no one directing anyone to the next available cashier. Very unfriendly workers."}
{"text":"Great food but completely inept staff. For some reason at this location they love to give you your ice cream right away and then have you pull forward and wait 10 minutes for the rest of your food. This has been a constant problem for over a year and needs to be fixed."}
{"text":"I was going to write a review for this fast food place some time ago.  Glad I didn't.   Burgers went from ok to awful.  Clerks are bone heads that don't listen to your order.  Cod fish sandwich needed an oil change.   Store apparently had no managers onsite Sunday.   My order was so screwed up I gave up and tossed the Cod in the trash. Culver's now rates below Burger King where I  only get iced tea.    Go to Wendy's, Arby's or Whataburger."}
{"text":"Only giving 2 stars here because tonight we ordered a container of their Flavor of the Day - Peanut Butter Cup, and basically received a container of vanilla custard and a few tiny crumbs of a peanut butter cup. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I ordered the cod sandwich.  Pulled to the spot to wait on my sandwich.  Got home only to discover the sandwich had been microwaved.  Soggy bun, soggy fish, warm lettuce.  Won't go back"}
{"text":"One bite of this \"butter burger\" and I was in an instant transported back to my Grandmothers kitchen as she would fry-up the most delicious burgers in butter!!!   This place is dangerous!!!      The fried cheese curds were a great accompaniment to burger heaven and the house brand root-beer was a perfect finish to an inexpensive burger.  Unbelievably delicious!!"}
{"text":"21 bucks latter  i got 2 fish dinners  that was Crap  nothing but grease alot of coating of fish and hardly fish  and so much grease   fries were so cold  and roll was hard.. lady told me we were getting cole slaw  but im sure it was crap also we never got cole slaw . thus was the worst i ever got and im still amazed for 21 dollars  i will never eat their again  Mcdonalds fish sandwitch would of been better than this and alot cheaper for sure ....  Crap Food   ."}
{"text":"This Culvers is just like every other Culvers.  You come for the awesome custard but the food is soo bad, by the time you are done you don't even want to look at the custard.  If you LOVE Culvers then you will love this place, but if you are like me then you know there is much better food in the immediate area.  Face it, Culvers is the place you settle on and never set out to eat at."}
{"text":"best damn grilled chicken sandwich period!! always fresh and service is good. rarely do I have problems and if I do they're quick to fix it. Keep up the good business."}
{"text":"Great burgers and cheese curds but they're frequently busy so long wait times should be expected"}
{"text":"Awesome burger..great prices..delicious concrete mixers and custard with different flavors every day..Actually met the owner at my barber shop and he was very nice and gave me free coupon for custard after I told him that I love his place & it was better than Freddys!"}
{"text":"Sooo amazing! I got the flavor of the day which was blueberry cheesecake... I am having dreams!! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first ever visit to a Culvers location and we had heard good things about them from most people in the area.  So, since it was a busy day and we didn't want to cook and this is about one mile from our place - burgers! Parking was a breeze and we got a spot right in front.    We were greeted as soon as we walked in and they were patient while we looked through the menu to get a feel for what we wanted. I opted for the butterburger with two patties, fries and a mint and Oreo concrete mixer.  I loved the burger, the bun was definitely buttery and the patty was cooked nicely.  The fries were crinkle cut (my fave) and they made a great side option.  The best part of the whole deal was the concrete mixer. Our cashier recommended it to me and said that it was the most popular order - there was no wondering why! The custard was a great change from a typical milkshake and the mint flavor was nicely done and not overwhelming.   Overall: A It's a butter burger place - get a burger, fries and a \"shake\" and regret nothing!"}
{"text":"We went to Culver's last night for the first time since they built the one in our neck of the woods on Cave Creek Road. I'll make this review brief because we didn't eat a full meal, just went for some frozen custard. We've all had frozen custard at little places we love in the Midwest, so were excited to try Culver's. When we pulled up, the air smelled strongly of fried fish as it was \"walleye special\" night. It wasn't the most appetizing aroma, but hey, we Midwesterners love our fish fries.   First off, I never knew Culver's was a fast food joint. Very similar to McDonald's, you order at a counter off a huge menu on the wall. The only choices for dine-in frozen custard were vanilla, chocolate or some flavor of the day. Then you were encouraged to add various candies and snacks to mix in as in a Dairy Queen Blizzard. In a case at the side of the lobby, there were containers of different frozen custard flavors that sounded pretty good, like chocolate-covered strawberry and bonfire s'mores. Unfortunately, there was none to be found except in those cartons for carry-out.   The chocolate frozen custard I tasted had a good texture but was amongst the sweetest ice creams or custards I've ever had. I would not order it again.  The other major criticism is that while we were waiting for our order, employees kept rushing past us and saying \"excuse me\" in a somewhat exasperated way. We finally figured out that we were supposed to go sit down and wait for our orders so we wouldn't be \"in the way.\" Woulda been nice if one of them had suggested that instead of just seeming annoyed that we were standing in the order counter/lobby area.  Whatevs. Would not recommend and would not return. If you already love Culver's from eating there in your childhood, you'd probably be happy with it now. If you've never been there before, make sure your expectations are set according to the reality of what they present. I would choose In 'n' Out burger any day over this place and go get gelato at That's Amore afterward."}
{"text":"what a cute place.  The butter burgers are made to order and melted in my mouth.  I am definitely a fan of the Wisconsin cheese curds. The malt milkshake was a little on the heavy side and hard to drink but otherwise good, not great or outstanding though. You place your order at the counter and they bring it to you when it's ready. They also have a drive thru which I haven't tried yet so I don't know how quick that might be. I do intend to go again for an inexpensive meal that is cooked right."}
{"text":"Just went through the drive  through.... Lisa had such a great attitude. Refreshing to come in contact with someone so nice in the fast food industry.  Keep up the great work Lisa!"}
{"text":"First fast food review here.  Just because that was a freakin' delicious cheese burger! Bacon deluxe, double, no pickles. There are fancier burgers, fru-fru gourmet burgers, expensive upscale burgers, which I've enjoined, but if want a simple tasty cheese burger this is it. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Mint Oreo concrete mixers are fantastic!  They do a great job here.  Always fast service and they get it right!"}
{"text":"The custard is good.  We are always satisfied with the selection.  I enjoy the root beer floats, french fries and onion rings there."}
{"text":"Delicious hamburgers, fries and dessert! The concrete mixers are like Dairy Queen blizzards on steroids!"}
{"text":"Our experience started out great.  The young man took our order and brought it to our table when it was ready.  He was polite and efficient.  He cleared tables when he wasn't busy taking orders.  I ordered 1 Deluxe  Single Basket.  After removing what is called a hamburger, I was able to eat the lettuce, tomato, and onion that was on the bun.  The hamburger was burnt on one side and looked like a smashed  end piece from a loaf of bread.  The piece of American cheese was thicker than the hamburger. It was an overcooked, inedible excuse for a hamburger. My overall rating is \"0\" or \"awful\"."}
{"text":"Don't come to the Cave Creek location if you want a CONCRETE mixer. Come here if you want SLUSH!"}
{"text":"I don't come here often but when I do, the flavors of the burgers that I order are just so fresh. Everything is so delicious, never dry. Just good, greasy food. Definitely better than most of the fast-food places around."}
{"text":"This Culver's needs just a little bit of tuning up. The cashier we had seemed to be fresh out of training and wasn't sure where a few of the buttons were but that's ok, everyone needs tome to learn. The kitchen should probably have a look at what \"everything\" means when it comes to their burger though - where was my ketchup and mustard? The service of out food was timely but the service of our flavor of the day scoops was lacking, I had to go up and ask for them for fear that they might end up melting - which they did a little bit. ?"}
{"text":"Stopped through the drive-thru to grab a drink and snack. Customer service at the window was friendly and they got my order right. No problems. Everything was perfect. A++"}
{"text":"Your restaurant seems to have made a huge turn around.  Where it was horrible 7 months ago, you seem to be back on track.  Thanks to Hannah.  She is a huge asset to your business.  Always smiling, knows her way around the restaurant, and is incredible in Customer service.  She is excellent."}
{"text":"Ironically, everything but the fries and burger (patty) was good. I have no idea what the rave is about. Fries weren't good at all, the burger patty was a pancake (get the double, the single is a joke) and the service was slow. Just moved here from San Diego, was hoping to try some new joints... this is not it."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of raving reviews, and yes, the burgers are pretty good (for the price).  When I received mine, the bottom half of the bun was really cold, and it did not arrive the way I asked.  After the meal, I ordered a frozen custard mixer.  That also wasn't given to me the way I ordered it.  When I told them they left out one of my choices of toppings, they decided to throw the entire thing away, and make me out to be a jerk when I wasn't trying to at all."}
{"text":"Got broken plastic in my concrete, then the guy behind counter took it out with his fingers yuck gross and super dangerous. When I asked for manager they were very rude and just treated like nothing  They need a metal top for mixing then put the plastic lid on it. Imagine letting your child  eat it with spoon!!! Very disappointing for a chain. Will never ever go there again  Just plain stupid and poorly run"}
{"text":"This location is awesome!! Everyone was so super nice to us and had a smile on their face it made for a really great experience, and we just went through the drive through! I would definitely come back to this location again. Keep it up guys :)"}
{"text":"It's not your mama's 99 cent burger but then again... it's worth more.  Everyone's been raving about Culvers, so passing it on the way home i was drawn in by the crowds and a quick trip through the drive thru made me a fan.  I'd give it 5 stars but i wasn't slammed with the custard but... maybe on another day or mine was too small to get into it. The burger though was an awesome treat. Those buttered buns and fresh ingredients.... just what the heart doctor ordered.  There were bigger ones on the menu but.. since i had just had lunch i thought a taste would sell me or not....and it did. From the reception this chain has gotten, i'd say their game plan is a winner and i can't wait to go back and try some of the other goodies for a more complete experience.  Now.. if White Castle would only make an appearance. But i think Culvers will give In & Out a fight for the burger buck in this town. Both are worth the trip though !"}
{"text":"I had never heard of Culver's until recently and despite them being close to my house I've only been there twice. And the first time didn't even really count because we were on the way home one night after a long drive from San Diego and were starving. We spotted the place and got burgers to go. I was so tired I honestly don't have any memory of what the burgers tasted like. However the most recent visit was memorable. I saw an ad somewhere for their fish dinner and posted it on my refrigerator. The picture was mouth-watering delicious but you know that the real food never looks as good as the ads, right?  I'll tell you right now this is one time that myth was shattered.  My first surprise was the price of the dinner ... under $10 for two HUGE perfectly cooked filets of cod, a large coleslaw, a decent amount of fries and a dinner roll. The only cod I have had that equaled it was at that place in Seattle that's famous for cod.  When I asked the counter clerk how big the fillets were he said the same size as they used in their fish sandwich so I assumed they were small.  Uh, uh, I could only eat one piece and the remaining piece was so big I ended up making two fish sandwiches out of it the next day.  I'm not sure why one person said he paid $8 for one single piece of fish because that's not even on the menu but my advice to him is buy the fish dinner next time and feed the rest to your pet pig.  As far as the rest of the story, the restaurant is simple, well-lit and clean. The counter clerk was friendly, helpful and mature for his age. The girl who handed me our order was also helpful, taking the time to tell me what else (like condiments, utensils, napkins, etc) were in the bag so there were no surprises when we got home.  Their menu pretty much focuses on burgers, fish and chicken with some unexpected things like chili, pot roast and other things being listed as specials.  All of their prices are reasonable; you can get a fresh cooked specialty burger for about a buck more than a Big Mac (no brainer).  Now that I know more about Culver's I have a feeling I'm going to become a regular."}
{"text":"I am giving this location three stars because the majority of the time everything is fine, accept this time. My friend and I went through the drive-thru and when we got home and opened up our food neither burger had a top bun. How does his happen? We called the store to let them know and we were told that no manager was going to be on duty which seems unprofessional. When we talked to the person in the phone, Kelly, she was impatient, rude and basically said we were out of luck. She said the only way for her managers to be informed she had to fill out a form and she didn't know how, wouldn't get help and refused to do anything about it. We live far so we were not able to return that day and went back the next day. When we went back we were able to get new food and were offered additional free pint of custard for our troubles."}
{"text":"I just came back from Culvers and it was a delicious experience (for fast food). I went through the drive-through since it was clear the inside was packed. The only problem I had was I asked for what was directly on the menu and labeled as  'limited edition' and was told they don't have it. \"smoky cheddar bacon & mushroom butterburger\"  So they asked if I would take a  \"smoky cheddar butterburger\".   I said sure thinking \"what a new guy...\" (note this place just opened today)  I quickly opened the wrapper to see what I got (it was now a mystery) To my excitement I got exactly what I wanted (bacon and mushroom and all!)  Food was great (if you like culvers and I do).  Drive through guy drove me slightly nuts, but I hope they improve it."}
{"text":"This place is pretty tasty!  The burger was good.  Well above average, but it better be when it's $5 or more.   My kid and I got a burger each, a soda, a shake and a mixer thing (like a Blizzard) and I dropped $20.  That's a bit over my budget for two.  We try and stay under $12 which is doable if we skip the ice cream/custard.  I don't know that we'd skip that if we're going to Culver's though.  The custard is pretty good.  Understand that I'm not a connoisseur of ice creams and related deserts.  They pretty much fall into two categories for me.  Good and not so good.  This is on the good side.  I prefer Fudruckers and Five Guys over these burgers.  I also prefer Cold Stone for ice cream."}
{"text":"Ok, \"butter burger\" can it get any better sounding?  Yes! Taste it.  This chain is mainly in north--found it way south!  Ice cream is great--shakes are super thick and cement mixers--yum!"}
{"text":"These burgers are really good.  I think I'm going to start just going for the burgers though.  You add fries and a drink it's kind of not worth it because their fries are average krinkle cut fries and the sodas aren't good either.  The burgers are delicious though.  Melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"The product is great. Unfortunately, the customer service is not good. Last time we were here the staff was fooling around, and then today we had to wait ten minutes for a small icecream."}
{"text":"Mmm Cheese Curds.  Cashew & Caramel Custard is good too.  Fast drive thru here.  Wish they had breakfast.  Or do they?"}
