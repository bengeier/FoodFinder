{"text":"Good.  Not great.  Very consistent and attentive service.  If you need sushi and a seaweed salad it is the place to go."}
{"text":"Have always had great food and service from Edo Garden in Monona. Had take-out sushi multiple times and always delicious and fresh. The best Hibachi night with Chef TJ, awesome time.!"}
{"text":"I went here for a date recently and it was awesome.  I was a little leery coming in as it was a Monday night around 7pm and there were only two cars in the parking lot, but inside the decor was great and we got our own private Hibachi room.  Our Chef (TJ I think) was not only very good at cooking, but was also hilarious.  He had us laughing from the moment he came out.  The food was spectacular too.  And we got A LOT of food, so it's a great value for the money.  I've been to five different Hibachi places in Wisconsin and Texas and this was the best so far.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went to Edo Garden to try the new Monday's special which is 50% off on their specialty rolls and I have to say that is an amazing deal, their rolls are huge and the flavor is addictive good, I will definitely be back for more on Mondays while this offer lasts!!!"}
{"text":"We visited here with a group of 6 for dinner. The sushi was good, but not the best I've had. If you're in Monona and need a sushi fix, you'll be fine. The Hibachi was really salty and not something I'd go for again. It didn't have much to it besides the sauce.  Service was ok, a little slow but attentive."}
{"text":"Decent sushi, really lackluster service.   We waited several minutes to be seated even though there were very few people there (at 7 PM on a Saturday!)--there was no greeter, no one at the front desk. The waitress who finally noticed us and seated us seemed very distracted and rushed.  To start, I ordered hot tea and my boyfriend ordered beer. Our waitress came back with the beer and a water for me because she \"got caught up in something and forgot\" what I ordered. Not only that, but during our 1 1/2 hour stay, she never once refilled my tea or asked either of us if we wanted another drink.   My boyfriend ordered the Sushi Deluxe, which comes with an assortment of nigiri plus a roll. His meal came without the roll, and when he asked the waitress about it, she seemed confused, then consulted a menu before realizing he was right.   His order came a good 10 minutes before mine, and while I understand that not everything will be ready at the same time, I would not expect to wait that long. And then it was a while longer before the forgotten roll came out.   Towards the end of our meal, we overheard another waitress apologizing to another party about something, which, after having OUR waitress apologize several times for mistakes, didn't instill much confidence in the overall management of the place.  It's too bad, because we both enjoyed the sushi. And the menu seems more extensive than some other places in town. But with slow service, multiple mistakes, no drink refills, and the sense that it was a management issue, not just one waitress making mistakes or having an off day, this will not be our first choice for sushi in the future."}
{"text":"Our first time here and I really can't say enough about the experience. Great service, great atmosphere, and fantastic food. The hibachi chef was extremely friendly and did a wonderful job preparing our food and did an awesome performance. It was my wife's birthday too, so she got to wear an honorary chef hat(and kept it!) and an amazing free tea ice cream dessert! I can't wait to eat the leftovers!"}
{"text":"I came here to have sushi since the reviews here were pretty good. Not everyone in my party was a sushi fan so they ordered something else but seriously, my cousins dish was literally a $12 bowl of rice with eggs. No, not egg fried rice. White rice with eggs on top. And another one of my cousins got a noddle appetizer and it literally looked like they took a bag of ramen noodles and just cooked that. My brother wanted Saki and the waiter gave him a Mai Thai cause it was to hot outside and it looked like he wouldn've enjoyed it better than the saki. What a disappointment and so disrespectful.  I'm not trying to say the restaurant was a completely mess but I was not impressed and not happy. Service (excluding the drink incident) was pretty good. The decor was very nice but I just wish the food was better. I was really hoping to like this place since I live very close to Monona."}
{"text":"Oops, I was at this Edo not the one in Madison. Our new favorite place to go for hibachi in the Madison area.  My wife, three kids and myself decided to go there at the last minute. There was no wait and it was a Saturday night, so I was a little nervous. I read the other reviews and didn't know what to expect. We sat down and ordered drinks. It took a little time to get but that would be the only negative of the whole night. Our chef was so much fun. We all had different dinners and everyone really enjoyed what they had, not an easy task for five people. The price wasn't bad and the service was excellent. I can't speak about sushi except to say that I don't like sushi. The hibachi though is great."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I've found in Madison so far  -- with excellent customer service.  Sushi options here in Madison seem pretty limited to me, but Edo is the best I've found so far, the quality of service, sushi and ambiance put it over the much-hyped, but underwhelming Takumi on all counts.  The sushi selections are very tasty and very fresh.  Prices are reasonable for sushi.  The private tea rooms are great options for a quiet romantic evening.  I can't really say anything about the hibachi dining or any of the other non-sushi fare since all I've tasted is the sushi, but my companions on my visits all  liked what they had.  The service here is always impeccable, some of the best I've had since moving to Madison."}
{"text":"Great hibachi food and good sushi.  The restaurant is always clean and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"My dinner experiences at Edo have been very mixed of late.  The service remains generally good, but the quality of the sushi is quite variable.  Their bento lunches are a wonderful change of pace if you can't make it downtown to Red."}
{"text":"No too sure why I didn't like this place. Food was salty and a little on the cool side. That being said, our waitress was awesome! Super friendly and nice, and even for 6pm on a Tuesday, it was dead.   We had the platters of spring roll and noodles with soup - and I was disappointed with the salty food and the lack of real taste. Everything was just \"ok\" - nothing stood out to me. I've had better rice and better veggies. Everything seemed to be heavy, and swam in oil. I was hoping for a better experience - oh, well. Maybe the Park Street location is the place to go......"}
{"text":"Edo Japanese Restaurant on Monona drive is such an awesome place! Their sushi is amazing every single time we go there. One of our favorite things is the Kani salad! Yum! Their hibachi dinners are great too and entertaining with fire and juggling! Their chefs and waitstaff are always super friendly! They have some great lunch specials too for a good price. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of our two go-to places for sushi -- not perfect, but pretty darn good. (New owners took over a year ago -- ignore older reviews.)  The fish selection is pretty good, and we've never gotten any questionable sushi. (The escolar we had last week was excellent.) The all-you can-eat offer (Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday)  is just a ton of fun.   They haven't developed the volume to be top-notch; the California roll has surimi, not crab, and they don't keep tobiko around. (Love Muramoto's tobiko corral sushi!)   They are trending now to \"new sushi\" stuff -- oversized rolls in exotic plating, with sauce drizzled all over the place. It's all pretty good if you like that sort of thing. I can always try something out for a chef that wants to push his/her luck a little -- that's my job as a customer. I don't care for many of them, though -- just not my style. So I'm glad they do a darn good job on the basics.   The regular menu is solid as well; excellent tempura and a donkatsu that works well for this good ol' Midwestern meat and potatoes guy.   One of these days, we'll ignore the sushi and menu and do the hibachi. The customers around the hibachis all seem to be having a great time."}
{"text":"We've been here twice, and both times were to take advantage of the all-you-can-eat sushi. It's a great deal, but the key thing to remember is that you have to pay for anything you don't eat.  Here's a ranking of our favorite rolls -- mostly just for posterity -- Z Roll, Sweet American, Fuji Roll, Crazy Dragon, Black Pearl, Tiger Roll."}
{"text":"Went for hibachi. Very disappointed. Too much butter, everything swimming in fat. Butter shouldn't even be used for Asian cooking. Everything too salty.  Awful soup alternative to miso  soup. Too much lemon on shrimp. Steak tough and overcooked. Got sushi appetizers and had to explain what we wanted (which was nothing odd) to waitress - seriously? Couldn't even order tekka maki by Japanese name. Had to explain it was a tuna roll (not even listed on menu as tekka maki). Tacky theatrics by hibachi chef, especially with dousing the \"fired-up\" onion stack. Staff was pleasant and service was good , but we won't be back."}
{"text":"My food was excellent I had the shrimp hibachi with the rice, noodles, and the vegetables and had a couple cups of sake. The chef had good tricks."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped here for dinner to catch up on the last 10 years. We were seated in a very nice tea room with coat hooks and ample seating. There are drink specials daily, so we tried the summer kiss  (refreshing!)  I enjoyed my Lady Gaga rolls, and my friend really enjoyed his seaweed salad, as well as the assortment of rolls he ordered. We even stayed a couple hours (closing the place down) and enjoyed some hot tea. The staff was so friendly and our waitress had an excellent sense of humor! The location can't be beat, right off the beltline, and one exit from the interstate.  :) I'll be visiting again"}
{"text":"We came here as a group of 20 for a birthday party. Magically they were able to set all of us up in the hibachi rooms.   As people arrived, the bartender was able to keep pace with the drink orders and everyone was well watered.  They make a very good long island.   The birthday girl got the famous ceremonial chef's hat and everyone was whisked into the hibachi room.   They gave us ample time to order and came back to check on drinks. We got two chefs who kept our non-PC crowd entertained, as well as contained.   I ordered the Shrimp Tempura bento box $15.95 because I wasn't in the mood for hibachi, because let's face it, part of what you're paying for is the show and I'm already getting that for free. It came with four pieces of California roll and shrimp shumai, two pieces of shrimp tempura, assorted vegetable tempura, rice, house salad, and miso soup. The tempura dipping broth was not your typical dashi broth, instead it tasted like watered down soy sauce. A huge pet peeve of mine is shrimp that isn't devined, as this was the case. The rest were okay, but it left something to be desired as I was picking at other peoples plates after my meal.   The hibachi show was great, did the volcano, plastic squirt doll,  and egg show.   As a birthday gift, they gave a free shot of an top-shelf, aged sake which was presented by the Manger, which I feel is a nice touch.   If you're looking for an accommodating restaurant with a polite and pleasant staff, this is a good spot."}
{"text":"So i've been here a few times. I want to like this place because its close to my work & home. So i figured I would try one last time and hope to really like Edo. Sorry.. but I am just not a big fan of the sushi here..  It just seems as if its missing something... Same with the beef yakisoba it had no spice.. no pizzaz.   Another thing that was \"missing\" in my last carry out order was the darn CHOPSTICKS?  Come on isn't that the norm to get some sticks with your take out order?  Oh.. wait I got a couple plastic forks! Maybe someone is trying to save a few bucks.. but next time ask me if i want a fork or chopsticks?  I need those suckers. Especially at the rate the sushi is going for.  One more thing..  I am just wondering what's up with the \"pond\" thats drained? Its on the left when you walk into the building? Can't miss it.. Someone please fill that sucker up with some water and koi fish!  Its been empty since the first time I dined there years ago. That would add a little flare to the rather empty feeling when you first walk in..."}
{"text":"If you happen to work out and need to replenish your internal salt supply, AND appreciate over-cooked lobster... and, after letting management know about the issues, attempts to liquor and ice cream you up do not succor you, please eat here at your own risk... This was the worst eating experience I've had in such a long time... Gonna have to have a whole lotta water by the bed tonight...  Also submitted this on Trip Advisor: \"Thank God for the company, who were funny, patient and awesome, because the food SUCKED! As if too much salt and over-cooked seafood weren't bad enough, management thought that a shot and a serving of ice cream could overcome the bad meal and blood pressure waiting to skyrocket amounts of salt from the meal... Somebody call the Dead Sea and let it know where it's missing salt went...\""}
{"text":"Nope.  The first time we were there, the service was slower but our rolls were really good.   My husband went tonight to get us take out, and he sat at the bar. The bartender rolled her eyes when he wanted a drink, and she was spitting out sunflower seed shells ONTO THE FLOOR.  When he got the food home, they had given him a shrimp roll instead of a shrimp tempura roll, and I couldn't eat my Philadelphia roll because the salmon was clearly a week old.  I'll drive an extra 10 minutes to Takumi next time."}
{"text":"EdoSushi is the best I have had in town! These people are so personable and my daughter loves to go into the tea rooms or have a Hibachi with friends!! Excellent service AND Great Food!!"}
{"text":"When I am eating raw fish I expect the place I am eating it from to be immaculate or I start getting a little freaked out.The place needs a remodel; the floor was uneven, the tables and chairs banged up, and there was also a gnat that wouldn't leave me alone. All of this lead to me thinking/feeling is this sushi safe to be eating!?. The place really needs some TLC! The menu was big. I liked that they had pictures of the specialty rolls. When the sushi came it was all good but nothing to write home about. Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Edo Garden was quite a disappointment. I've been a huge fan of hibachi-style Japanese food for most of my life. We recently moved to Monona and decided to take visiting relatives there for dinner. While the staff went out of their way to accommodate our party, the rest of the service was mediocre. Our hibachi chef was sub-par. Part of the hibachi experience is the entertainment factor of watching the chef's fancy, fast work with his tools on the grill. Our chef was unable to perform. He also spoke no English at all, which caused some confusion with our steak preferences. Finally, the food itself was just not what I've come to expect from a hibachi grill. The flavors were not very good. Everything was cooked mostly in butter. The miso soup was very good, but all of the actual grilled food, not so much. Our server brought out a plate of ice cream, whipped cream, and drizzled chocolate, which my young daughter and I enjoyed. I'm not sure why and I don't think we were charged for it, but it was a very nice gesture. I may go back sometime and give their sushi a try, but I think I'll go back down to Janesville or Rockford for my hibachi grill fix."}
{"text":"This is a steady option for sushi in Madison.  The prices are fair and it's a consistent good experience.  The service is top notch and if you sit at the sushi bar you'll always get a treat unless they are busy.  Spicy, crunchy yellowtail is one of my fav's."}
{"text":"I love the private tea rooms for dining in peace. I've loved Thier food for years, but wish that the fountain in the front was working or more esthetically pleasing. Their pieces are almost very good, so you can treat yourself to some fresh sushi at a low price."}
{"text":"Nice friendly service, horrible, horrible sushi. The rice was gooey like rice pudding. We were hungry enough to finish the various old and tough fish pieces, but we're paying for it today,, very sick. Never again."}
{"text":"Such a disappointing place. It's meant for undergrads or folks who don't really care about the quality of food. That said, you don't really get quantity here either.  The only saving grace of the place was the sweet potato sushi. The sweet potato was fried and wrapped like a california roll. Good job!  Other items I've had were all disappointing. And sadly my friend had an upset stomach after getting sushi. So folks, the freshness of sashimi here is doubtful. I also usually get the nabeyaki udon, thinking that cooked food will be safe. There was nothing interesting in the udon. The ingredients were overcooked and tasteless. No, not even when I'm sick will I want to eat it.  Service was minimal, and they are run by Chinese, not Japanese. So I guess you can't expect much from them.   Yeah, I only came here for the Savor Taste Race and it reminded me of the low quality food I used to have when I was an undergrad. No more visiting Edo, I'm done!"}
{"text":"When I say DISAP you say POINTED. Disappointed!  Disappointed!  I really hate writing this review because in the past we have had such great experiences at EDO and this review is not about the food because the Sushi and Hibachi are good food.  But the service...WHOA!  Picture it...Valentines Day and my wife and almost 2 year old want a nice dinner.   We debated many nice places but with the child they can be difficult at times so we decided some Sushi and Hibachi is nice, quick and delicious.  So we plan a early arrival at a place we have been to before...EDO!  When we arrive the place is almost empty and we get one of the private dining rooms.  Sushi Rolls are ordered as an appetizer. Dumplings and chicken fried rice are ordered are ordered for our daughter to come out with the appetizers.  And a Hibachi meal to split for my wife and I as an entree. And....we wait.  After 50 minutes still no food.  Ok, starting to get annoyed.  1 hour and 15 minutes of waiting and here come our sush....nope.  it is our Hibachi entree.  WTF?  Really?  I was explained by the waitress that they had an influx of orders and were really behind.  Hmmmm, ok...so I decided to scope out the scene because they obviously had many patrons arrive after we did.  Not so much, because the place had maybe 2 people at the Hibachi table, 2 people at the sushi bar, and about 5 other tables full.  In other words the place was dead.  About 10 minutes after our entree arrived our daughters food arrived and the chicken friend rice was bland and the dumplings were still cold.   1.5 hours after our arrive we finally got 2 of our 3 sushi rolls and the third about 10 minutes after that.  We enjoyed the first 2 rolls and got the third to go as we were obviously over the experience and not even our daughter who was starving liked her food (she ate what she probably really wanted after we left, McDonalds).  I have a hard time understanding a couple things here.  1)  How does it take 1.5 hours for sushi when the place is dead.  2) Why would you bring our entree our before our appetizer when we clearly wanted the sushi first?  3) When we placed the kids order and said bring that ASAP....does that mean an hour of so later?    Do not get me wrong.  Besides the chicken fried rice and the frozen dumplings the hibachi and sushi were great but holy lord the service was about as fun as watching Alabama win a National Football Championship (and for an Auburn fan that is not fun).  Sorry EDO, I love your food and maybe you can make it up to me in the future but the service last night was pure crap and a major turn off.  What happened EDO?   What happened?  DISAP...  Oh yeah, oh, the steamed rice and little sauces that normally accompany the hibachi never arrived and when we asked the waitress she knew nothing about them."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I love edo on park street so I thought it'd be just the same. When I pick up my sashimi, they made the salmon into flower... A bad sign! The take out sashimi were thin and not fresh."}
{"text":"I was impressed by the great selection of specialty rolls when we came in. For the price, you can't beat it. I'm pregnant, so they were able to modify my order for me. Best part, they told me all about the 50% off special for Monday night, and I came back for four more awesome rolls! Salad, soups, hibachi and customer service also rock!"}
{"text":"Food is average at best, but the food wasn't the main issue. Last winter I had made a reservation for a hibachi grill; when my group and I arrived the server told us their heating in our room was broken, but seated us anyways and made no accommodations! Keep in mind this was December in Wisconsin. The room could not have been warmer than 60 degrees. At least get a space heater or something! What gets worse is it happened again this winter, exact ordeal. Needless to say I will not be returning. If you are headed to Edo, be sure to bring hats, gloves and blankets!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been there in a while. Wow, has it gone down hill. Food was terrible. The soup was disgusting. Both my sister and I couldn't eat it. The entrees were cold and way too salty."}
{"text":"Definitely won't be visiting this place again. We had our own tea room, which was a plus since we had our 8 month old with us, but beyond that we weren't happy with our experience. The room was dirty and the service was poor. We were there early and there were only a few other diners there but my husbands sushi order took so long we nearly left instead of waiting. I had already eaten my entire hibachi dinner before he got his meal. He did say the sushi was decent, and they had a nice looking bar, so I mustered two stars for the review, but we are new to the area and will be trying other Japanese places instead."}
{"text":"This by far is not the best hibachi restaurant by far, but one of the better ones in madison. Ginza has let their restaurant go into disrepair and the quality is questionable at best. This review is for this restaurant, so I guess the best part of this place is I can get hibachi for lunch. I have walked in many times with as little as a friend and I and they always fire up the grill"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. The tiny parking lot was packed, but inside was not as packed. Ordered a few vegetable rolls and seaweed salad. The avocado roll was extremely flavorless, service was ok. One person in our dinner party was given the wrong food because the waitstaff ordered the wrong food for her. Edo on Park St has always been pretty tasty. It's sad that Monona isn't just as good. The sushi rice tasted like it didn't have any vinegar added...it was just plain rice."}
{"text":"Love coming here. Quiet. There are \"private rooms\" (great for a first dates). Anyways, The staff is always professional. The sushi is delicious. There are some days that are hit-or-miss, but that is with an dining out facility. Overall, I keep coming back for me. :)"}
{"text":"Probably the only place in Madison area to get AYCE sushi for one and for under $30 at that makes it better yet. Its not the very best sushi I have ever had before being I am one from San Diego where there is a sushi joint on every corner with real deal master sushi chefs running the place so consider that. Even with that the 12-15 rolls you can pick from are not half bad by any means. I had 9 of them for pete sake! I also had the miso and 2 salads they offer with the buffet and those were a hit. I liked the Golden Dragon, Black Pearl and Sweet Potato Tempura rolls best. Worth a return visit for both wallet and pallet benefit."}
{"text":"The food is amazing particularly the sushi and sashimi deluxe.  We've eaten there on several occasions and not been disappointed.  The cuts of fish were plentiful, the service was attentive, and the specials are worth coming back.  They've done some nice work with updates and the tea rooms, but the ambiance is somewhat lacking."}
{"text":"AMAZING crab & seaweed salad. Food arrived quickly and was delicious!"}
{"text":"Kids had a sushi fix. Edo was on the way home.  Had Edo on Park Street last month (wouldn't be going there again).  Thought, let's give the Monona  location a try for dinner.  We were seated in the tea room.  Filthy, sticky table,  wall was pealing and if you look up at the ceiling pretty gross.    Food was mediocre.  Ordered the dragon roll & eel roll( could use more eel sauce) & vegetable soba was just ok.  The sushi was bland-rice needed more vinegar & sugar mix.  Will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Both me and my boyfriend had an amazing meal here. Really tasty and fast. Loved the environment and mood of the restaurant and our server was very friendly and attentive. Will be back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My god, reading the reviews on yelp for this place prompted me to hurry up and review it too.  The sushi here is JUST okay.  It's not exactly cheap either.  But it feels overpriced for what you're getting.  I also don't care for the ambiance.  The private tea rooms are nice, but if you don't sit in one of them, it just feels like you're in this big empty room.  The last time I ate here, they accidentally added an extra entree to our bill. So, when we were paying, we thought it seemed kind of expensive, and we barely had enough cash to cover it.  We finally realized what the problem was after our waitress complained to my sister that she didn't leave a big enough tip.  They seemed more upset about the tip than the fact that they overcharged us by $9.  I dunno, I guess if i were desperate for sushi, and happened to be in Monona, I'd eat here again, but otherwise I doubt it."}
{"text":"I walked in on a Monday, excited to try some of their rolls, as they've got a 50% discount on specialty rolls on Monday.  I placed a take out order for 5 of their rolls, which I carefully selected from their 50% off list.  I took the sushi home and my husband and I hungrily dug in.  And we were disappointed. Gravely.  All 5 of the rolls came slathered with \"house special spicy sauce,\" which is used, I suspect, to cover up the fact that the sushi packed into the rolls is quite far from fresh.  It would be unfair to speculate that this establishment is trying to pack week-old sushi into a discount roll and then hide the week-old fact with extremely flavorful sauce, so I'm not going to accuse them of that.  I *will* say that I won't go back to Edo. Ever. Because their sushi was not good. At all."}
{"text":"A few friends and I were craving Sushi while visiting Madison; a friend suggested Edos.   Upon arrival I was impressed by the interior design of Edo. The restaurant had a very modern Japanese layout. Being a Chicago native where Sushi is easily accessible, I expected more from Edos considering this is one of the few Sushi restaurants in Madison.   The Food:  Rolls were priced fairly. 6-9 dollars per roll which contained 6-8 pieces; average price for most dine in sushi   My order consisted of crunchy salmon roll and a Manhattan Roll. The Manhattan Roll is spicy salmon on the inside topped off with a slice of tuna. The Tuna was thawed and tasted very mushy, almost to the point where it tasted not even fresh.   The crunchy salmon roll consisted of spicy salmon on the inside, but after eating a few pieces I realized there was little to no salmon and even went to the extent of taking the roll apart to see what was inside; I was right, there was little to no salmon.   The overall atmosphere of the restaurant was great. Our waiter was great, and the restaurant was very clean. The food quality is what ended Edo's with 3 stars. Food quality can be much better considering this is a Japanese Restaurant and one of the few Sushi restaurants in Madison.   I will possibly be giving Edo's one more try the next time I visit Madison."}
{"text":"I enjoy my visits to Edo. Is it my favorite sushi place in town? No. But I do think they're well priced for the items they serve. If you're looking for decent sushi on a budget then this is the place for you. I've never ordered or had the hibachi so my review is based solely on the sushi.  Pros: I appreciate the tea rooms and private booths Inexpensive (If you're comparing to other sushi resturants) Large selection of specialty rolls Service has always been great and fast Specialty rolls are packed with goodies Atmosphere is nice, friendly, and fairly quiet Their shumai is amazing  Cons: Items don't always feel fresh but for their price I cant really complain Miso soup tastes VERY fishy Ginger and wasabi are meh  Overall, It's a pretty decent place and i'll most definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in town! Very good service! Everyone is very helpful and energetic. My family and I went to Edo for a birthday. Everyone was more than happy with the food and service!"}
{"text":"If you are a sushi connoisseur this is not the place for you.  Cheap sushi, no frills, lots of roll choices.  The service was clearly lacking as no one manned the hostess stand, the wait staff was spread thin and by one waitress's own admission the kitchen staff was short also.  That being said, my food came out fast and everyone was very nice.  This is likely a place the neighborhood goes to as there were plenty of high schoolers there as well as some college kids.  If you want basic, one step up from grocery store sushi, this place will do.  $21.00 for 12 pieces of sushi and a spicy tuna roll.  I still wouldn't return."}
{"text":"New owner keeps us coming back.  Was a customer about 7 years ago, horrible service and uncaring owner.  Decided to try it again recently and found it under new ownership.  We got to know the owner by sitting at the sushi bar, very nice man and wants happy customers.  He always remembers us when we come in (once every few months), happily greets us, talks to us, remembers what we like.  His staff is attentive and speaks good English.  Sushi is by far the best sushi in town.  Sushi lunch special is average, I'd like to see more variety on it.  We have tried the hibachi, found we like the value of the competition better (they have dinner for 2 for under $40).  You get a lot for your money at Edo Monona, but it's still pricey for hibachi in my opinion. Badger Roll is our favorite....delish!!!  They used to have a chance to win a free sushi lunch, won it once...wish they'd bring it back, or have a frequent customer club!"}
{"text":"Great food. Love the hibachi and amazing sushi selection! Haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"This is officially my new favorite sushi place, which pisses me off to no end because it's over an hour away from my house. Bring me a Milwaukee location and I'll probably singlehandedly keep it in business!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good, actually. We've been here 10 or 15 times and love it. Apparently we have unusual tastes because it's always empty, but that's just fine by me - never a wait, we can sit wherever we want, and the service is always good.  The entrees are always fresh and most are quite tasty. I did have one with wide, flat rice noodles that had been cooked into mush in a bean sauce, but the sushi, noodles, and teriyaki are all great. The hibachi was fun the first time, but got old pretty quick and the food there is bland and oily (though, obviously, very fresh).   The ambiance is simple and classy - the kind you don't really notice because you're there for the food and the company. Excellent for a big group! I think the place is just not trendy enough to attract the hipster crowd who frequent other Japanese places in town. Again, fine by me."}
{"text":"The service was okay, but not very quick. The food was similarly okay. Expected the experience to be better based on other reviews we saw."}
{"text":"I started out with the Edo on Park Street a number of years ago, and was happy to see they'd opened a second location. The Monona venue is rarely super-busy, and thus generally quieter than its Madison sibling.   Sushi is of decent quality for what's available in the Midwest; not the best in the area, but FAR from the worst. I'd call it solid and reasonably-priced.   Service can be somewhat mixed - it's been inattentive/slow at times, and fine at others. I wouldn't pick this place (unless you got takeout) if you were in a rush."}
{"text":"Overall, not a terrible experience. I prefer Takumi on almost all fronts, however. From the miso to the sushi. Some of the more specialty rolls here may be good, but I haven't tried them (they were a bit expensive for my tastes, so i skipped over them quickly). The Tokyo roll and tuna roll I ordered were good but not amazing. The fish was too room-temperature for my tastes, almost a bit gaggy, actually. The miso tasted like it was missing something, salt, maybe? I don't know, but I didn't finish it, and I usually can't get enough miso.  Three stars (instead of my gut-instinct of 2) because the service was actually excellent. The waiter gave me a lunch special even though one of the rolls I ordered was not supposed to be eligible for the combo, and was extremely attentive and friendly. Though, I was one of only two tables in the place over an after-lunchtime lull, so that may have had something to do with it, as well as me being a not-too-terribly-hideous woman eating by myself...come to think of it, he was probably hitting on me the whole time and i was just sitting there thinking, \"dang, the service here is excellent!\"  dummy me...  If sushi is the menu of choice, i'll be at takumi, hands down. and I'll have to agree with Aftee in one of the other reviews: the empty pond thing right as you walk in the door is a little off-putting."}
{"text":"Our go-to take out sushi restaurant.  The sushi and sashimi selection is exceptional.  There is a lot to choose from.  However, the service could improve."}
{"text":"Good food. I've had better for the $ though. This is a good place for large groups (make sure to call ahead for a reservation though)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great. The prices are very reasonable and the quality is always good. I have dined-in a handful of times but for the take-out lunch specials are where it's at for \"treat yo' self\" days.   The 2-roll lunch special clocks in at about $11 and includes miso soup and ginger salad. It's perfect. However, if I dine with a friend I like to mix it up and get a vegetable tempura bento box to split (also comes with soup, salad, rice, & dipping sauce) at about $10 it's perfect to share! So if you go the buy & share route, for about $11/person you get miso soup, ginger salad, 4 generous pieces of tempura, rice, and a full roll! It is more than I can eat When fast food meals are almost $8 - your wallet will let you splurge on food that will not last 2 years in a cupboard!"}
{"text":"went here for a work lunch.  the food was a bit slow but, worth the wait.  I had the Tempura Odun - quite yummy."}
{"text":"Came for the $29 all you can east sushi special (Sunday, Monday and Tuesday only) and was really happy with the quality, variety and service. The hibachi was busy with several small groups (at least one birthday party) and the dining room waitstaff were attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi around Madison!! We love the place, which is really well decorated. The habachi might be a bit slow but its worth it. The chef was soooo funny and entertained us well. We had a great night. Our waitress was sweet and helpful. Definitely would come again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times before and I always thought it was solid. This last experience, however, was not good. Really not good. I couldn't even finish my bowl of miso soup. It was so sour (I didn't think miso could go bad?) and had just a few pieces of the saddest seaweed and tofu. As far as the sushi, they seem to have an affinity for the mayonnaise-y drizzle over everything. I don't really respect that approach in the first place and they really take it to an extreme here.   Finally - the cardinal sin. They used imitation crab meat in the California roll. This may be a reason why we were the only people in there."}
{"text":"How did I miss this gem?  After pooooor service at Sumo, I had the pleasure of going to Edo for dinner with friends.  We got our own tea room, service that was almost too fast, and the food was good!  I had the bento box, my BF had noodles (which he still talks about), and I just had to return for the lunch specials.    Early in the week at dinner, and at lunch, Edo runs fantastic sushi specials.  I ordered the specialty roll lunch, and wow, it was great.  Everything was so fresh, and the service was super friendly.    They put their money in the food and the service, and less on the decor, although it is a nice dinning area.   Not the fanciest place, but it's comfortable, and approachable."}
{"text":"Sadly it was pretty bad service. Food was good, but we barely saw any wait staff and the restaurant wasn't even that busy.  We called ahead and made a hibachi table reservation for 2 and it took 2 hours from when we sat down to when we left. Again, it was not that busy. The topper was when they gave us 2 warm bottles of beer. Check please!"}
{"text":"This was my first All You Can Eat Sushi (AYCES) experience, so I don't have much to compare to in that department. From what friends told me, however, the price is good at $25 a person, which include tea/soda, miso soup, and salads. Also, from what I understand, the AYCES \"rules of the house\" are on par with other places.   We had a group of about 16 people and the restaurant accommodated us quite well. Surprisingly, service was prompt, especially given our large party. Drinks came out within a reasonable amount of time (and the drinks are cheap!!). Miso and salads came out quickly. The sushi itself was tasty and fresh, but not the best that I've eaten in my lifetime.  AYCES rules - each person can order 2 rolls or 10 pieces of sashimi at a time. One must eat all of said pieces before ordering more. If any specialty rolls or sashimi are left on the plate at the end of the meal, you get charged for them.   AYCES Survival TIP: Go with a group!!! If you don't like something that you ordered, someone else will! If you don't finish a roll, someone else will!   For all that we ordered, not a bad price at $25 a pop. They even let us bring home the specialty rolls that we did not eat (and were charged for). I was so full that I probably won't want sushi for another year, but I would recommend the experience at least once in a lifetime."}
{"text":"I went to Edo a couple weeks ago with friends.   First lets start with the restaurant. Nice ambiance. We had a private room. So cool!   I got the avocado salad. Yum! I was not super impressed with the ginger house dressing, which is usually one of my favorites at places like this. I got hot tea - yummy and perfect on a cold night! I can't remember exactly which roll I got, but it was good. They a have a lot to choose from and run specials throughout the week.   Service was good. Overall a good place. Not the best sushi I've ever had, but a good restaurant overall."}
{"text":"We had made a reservation for a hibachi grill for daughters bday @8pm on Tuesday night. Not too many people in restaurant, more carryouts then anything. We were happily seated at 7:50 pm, salads & soup, drinks were timely, however chef was NOT. Chef \"Jerry\" did not come out to cook until 8:38pm. Again, the hibachi side of the restaurant was DEAD. Our chef was extremely boring. Did not know how to entertain, he simply cooked in front of us. What exactly extra was I paying for??? Our server, although very nice, seemed to be running the place. She brought 2 bowls of white steamed rice to us before our cook came out, strange right. In the past, the rice was served with the food. She served us our sides while restaurant phone in her pocket rang loud. She appeared to be handling carryout orders. The food was mediocore at best; the cook added heaps of butter & sprays of oil to EVERYTHING on the grill. The shrimp cooked the entire time. I did mention to the chef that I thought the shrimp had cooked enough but he said they were ok. I sent mine & daughters back, who eats burnt rubber shrimp???... (I am from the east coast).If it weren't my daughters bday, and late, I would have long left that restaurant. I don't think we will be back. We usually eat there 3-4 times a year--usually we get the owner as our chef, who is apparently was in China on this visit. For that much cash, I expect your best.  Also want to mention that we had to ask for clean plates. The chef said they were clean they just appear to look dirty, maybe so but not appealing."}
{"text":"I have no idea why Edo would have only three stars! It's definitely not five-star Japanese cuisine but everything we ordered was great, and exactly what we were expecting. We got a few different vegetable sushi, the spicy tuna roll, gyoza, chicken teriyaki and vegetable tempura, which I have to say they do really well here! Not heavy or oily which means they're frying at the proper temperature. The prices were also great for all the food we ordered for four adults and a child, and the atmosphere was just really nice and quiet, with great service from a very nice and efficient waitress."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is fantastic and service is always attentive.  The avocado salad with its ginger dressing is to die for."}
{"text":"I want to love it but I just like it. Our chef along the Hibachi experience and food were great! Our group had a mix of steak, chicken, scallops and fried rice. All came out as ordered and very tasty.   The soup and salad starters were a mixed bag. Miso soup, really good. Salad, extremely over-dressed. Like hunt for the lettuce in the dressing, dressed.   What needs most attention isn't the food or service but the physical space itself. There were random boxes of beer, dinnerware, and service stations throughout the dining area. Depending on where you were seated you could have a less than optimal viewing."}
{"text":"Sushi means rice. The rice tasted old, generally bad and never held its form. The raw fish of sushi should taste delicious and not \"fishy\". Their cooked rolls are even worse, their tea is hot but not green. Their Kani salad was like a crazy aunts bad cole slaw instead of a fresh seaweed salad. Tuna rolls have ground tuna which is disgusting. The service was good. Sushi in the middle of Wisconsin is not expected to be great but it should be good and this is not."}
{"text":"Was in town for a meeting/training and I was SO happy that this place was open on a Monday.  Great sushi deal Mondays (buy one maki roll get 2nd half off).    The ambiance was great - my colleagues and I had a private room.  Some are private with curtains and other are private by sliding screens.  We each ordered a roll and tried each others and for the table to share, a vegetable goyza (potsticker) and edamame.  Someone ordered the seaweed salad - seasoned to perfection.  The house salad was typical iceberg but the dressing wasn't my favorite mustard-style (but that's a matter of personal preference).    Decent wine list and EXTENSIVE menu of rolls.  Habachi  and bento box dinners are available.  Sushi was very fresh,  dipping sauces were excellent.    Server was great.  We were having such great conversation and laughing we didn't feel rushed.  She was very attentive.   I book-marked this restaurant because we will be back again.  A treasure in Monona."}
{"text":"The 2 stars is for the server and chef who were very friendly! Their ginger dipping sauce is yummy too. The food was horrible. Everything was \"soaked\" in a sugar laden sauce. Usually hibachi sauce is simple of fresh squeezed lemon juice, soy sauce and butter. They used a ketchup bottle full of this mysterious sauce. I have no clue what was in it but it was thick. The scallops weren't cooked with butter until the very end so they were rubbery and then that sauce was added too. The veggies weren't good as the onion wasn't cooked long enough. It was more like Chinese with the carrots, broccoli and mushrooms. The noodles they serve were bland. It was not a good experience with how expensive it is. I paid $109 for 3 meals not including tip.  Ginza had much better hibachi and I'm sad they closed.  Edo does have good sushi, so I'll stick to that."}
{"text":"Okay if you really want Japanese food, and they have a nice bar and dining area, but the food at the Monona location is not particularly fresh or well prepared."}
