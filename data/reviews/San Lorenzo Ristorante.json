{"text":"This Place is FIRST CLASS! 
Genuine Service and Exceptional food. 
I enjoyed their fish \"special for the day, Grouper Romane.  Delicious dish with a side of steamed rice and a fresh artichoke. 

Will definately go back soon for a second meal"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give San Lorenzo a try on a Friday night and we were not disappointed! Given that we live a few blocks away, we had walked by many times and had never seen many people inside; yet the menu always looked appealing to us. We have lived in much bigger cities than Pittsburgh with arguably better restaurant scenes, and absolutely love Italian food. I'm trying to say... our standards are high. 

We had made a reservation beforehand and walked in to our pick of several tables. We chose a 2 top just inside the front door, which was just lovely. The breeze from outside was so nice and we got to enjoy the romantic decor, especially the lights hanging around the front windows. We brought a bottle of wine with us and enjoyed a very reasonable $7 corkage fee. 

For dinner, we started out with the burrata, which had an understated yet beautiful presentation. The portion size was ample and it came with roasted red peppers, roasted and sun dried tomatoes, and seasonal preserves. It was delicious. My husband ordered the carbonara and I had the gnocchi with caramelized mushrooms and arugula. Both were wonderful; my  husband's was a tad on the salty side, which I think came from the pancetta, but mine was spot on flavor-wise. The portion sizes were definitely appropriate. We eyed up the desserts but were so full from dinner and wine that we held off.

We were very pleased with our meal here. It's a more traditional style of Italian restaurant than other local Italian establishments. The service was perfect- so attentive and sweet. It was so nice to not have to wait for a table and to just walk right in. We will definitely be coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a few weeks and was finally able to over the weekend. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The food is very good. I see their daily lunch specials on Nextdoor and everything seemed fresh and tastey, and we weren't disappointed.  The salads, pasta dishes we tried, and olive oil cake were excellent. We will return! Also love that it is byob!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, byob, relaxing atmosphere....I will be back!  We loved the calamari appetizer.  I thought my lasagne was fantastic."}
{"text":"My husband & I ate here for the first time last night. It was awesome!! The waitress was attentive & knowledgeable. The food came out quick & was delicious! We will def be going back. A quiet dinner date spot."}
{"text":"The food at this place is a true stand-out.  Its not super trendy like most other places in Lawrenceville.  The floors are carpeted and the ambiance is more traditional.  It wasn't filled with Hipsters and we walked right in to get a table on a Friday night at 7PM.  Our server was very friendly.

But back to the food.  Oh the food!!! First off, the place is BYOB.  Huge money saver.  My hubby and I don't eat meat, and since most of thentréeses are meat, we went apps and pasta.  We started off with beans and greens and artichokMilanesese.  Both were HUGE and fantastic.  We were both alreadgettingng full after the apps.  

Next, the hubby got a house salad which was a good size and full of goodies.  He was pleased.  I got the heirloom tomato caprese.  It UNBELIEVABLEABLE.  heirlooms, basil, mozzarella, capers, grilled peaches- it was heaven.  Fresh, large, beautifully plated and the contrasting flavors went wonderfully together.  

We were both officially stuffed after the salads and we ordered a split pasta to finish off our dinner- gnocchi.  It came pseparatelyrately. If this was a split portion (which I confirmed that it was), I can't imagine anyone ever finishing a dish themselves.  If you are Italian or love gnocchi, you know how easy it is to mess it up and get a heavy little ball.  This, fortunately, was a perfect little pocket of airy gnocchi.  Up there with some of the best in the city (Dish, il pizziolo).  

We weren't able to finish our gnocchi, so we didn't make it to dessert, but we walked out with only a $55 bill.  Couldn't believe it for the quality and quantity of food. 

I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Lawrenceville finally has a nice date restaurant! The space is roomy- no sitting on top of the next table here. The lighting was suitably dim, but not too dark to read a menu. Overall, very cozy atmosphere. The service was impeccable- we never felt hovered over, but our waters stayed full and every need was anticipated. As for the food, 
there was not a bad bite on a plate. The bread was delicious, served with a side of fresh ricotta and olive oil. For appetizers, we ordered the artichokes and calamari. The artichokes were so tender and creamy. The calamari, fresh and in a phenomenal sauce with capers and olives. For entrees, we had the mushroom gnocchi in truffle oil and artichoke rigatoni. Both were savory and large servings- we had plenty to take home.  I almost hope that no one reads this review- the service and food was so good that I want to keep it to myself."}
{"text":"Great service. Sydney chicken Milanese and baklava cheesecake were awesome. The chicken was cooked perfectly with an amazing favor. We never imagined how delicious baklava and cheesecake taste when combined. Our group also tried the linguini carbonara and braciole, both had excellent flavor."}
{"text":"Excellent romantic Italian dinner with my wife!   Very quaint and excellent pasta dishes.  BYOB is a great plus with a small cork fee. Good service and good food.  One of Lawrenceville's hidden gems!  They take reservations which is always nice."}
{"text":"By far the best Italian in Lawrenceville!  Our service was fabulous, Ashley was attentive, truly knew and obviously enjoyed the menu. I ordered a linguini with shrimp, scallions and chives, it was very good, I did have to lightly salt it.  My husband ordered chicken casalinga, a nice sized portion and very good - I did salt his lightly also.  We will go back!"}
{"text":"Went to this Italian restaurant because our friend is a drummer in a jazz band and they play there every other Tuesday. The place is a small BYOB eatery with a friendly wait staff and a limited menu. Usually when the menu is small the food tends to be better and fresher. We were not disappointed. My wife and I are small eaters so we usually share our food. We had greens and beans, a huge bowl of tomato soup and a margharita flatbread. Everything was delicious. The beans and greens were the best I've tasted. The bowl of soup was large and loaded with chunks of tomatoes . Finally, the flatbread was loaded with large dollops of San Manzano tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese. The only reason I didn't   give the place five stars is because I didn't have any of the main entrées. Therefore you must wait till I return there and try the entrees. And, I hope to do that soon. Probably next jazz night."}
{"text":"Oh my, from start to finish! This restaurant is wonderful.......completely different flavors. My husband and I came here for our anniversary last night.........it's pretty special.  The calamari (not fried) was sauteed in a spicy puttanesca sauce, that was to die for.  My husband had linguine and mussels with chick peas that was spicy and also great. I had linguini with shrimp and zucchini and smoked mozzarella. Dessert was a lemon tart (not homemade albeit tasty and not too sweet). We'd go back here in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday night with my fiance and another couple for dinner.  After looking up the location on the internet I was surprised that I had never noticed this place before as it is located right on Butler Street and I had parked right across the street from it the week before.  However once I did notice it I realized that it was a pretty cute location.  The inside of the place was tastefully decorated but we all also thought that the temperature was a bit cold although that was probably due to the summer cold front that had just come through.  It was also a fairly small establishment and I would guess that it would probably max out at around 40 people or so.

The week that we attended happened to be restaurant week and so a house salad and a dessert were included in the price of our entrees.  For my entree I decided to go with the rabbit gnocchi while my fiance went with the linguine pescatore.  The first thing out on our table happened to be bread and a dipping sauce.  The bread was a pretty good Italian bread and then the dipping sauce was EVOO and some herbs.  After that came our salads which seemed to be pretty standard except for the sunflower seeds on them.  While I couldn't see myself purchasing it as a stand alone item, I was happy to have it as part of my meal. The next items to come to our table were our entrees.  My gnocchi was a ricotta gnocchi with a rabbit ragu that was topped with some pickled cherries.  After placing it in front of me our server then asked if I would like some freshly grated pecorino romano on top of it which I did.  Overall I was pleased with my meal and thought the gnocchi had a nice and light texture while also having a good taste. The rabbit was also good and cooked nicely but my favorite addition was the pickled cherries which gave a the dish a nice little acidity.  Finally for dessert we were given the option of a number of different cakes: a shortcake, a limoncello cake, a chocolate cake and an oreo cake.  Since I am not able to eat chocolate, I ended up going with the Limoncello cake and was happy with my decision.  The cake had a really good flavor of Limoncello to it and was also moist.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I love that this place is BYOB and I thought the food was good for the price as well."}
{"text":"After seeing their restaurant week special, I couldn't resist and made reservations for four. When we arrived, there were only a few other tables with customers. The rest of the small (40ish seats) restaurant was empty. Our server quickly opened our wine (BYOB) and asked if we had any questions about the menu. She explained that the restaurant week menu included a side salad and dessert. I went with the pork chop for my main entree while hubs opted for the rabbit gnocchi. Soon we were presented with a bread basket and EVOO dip. We gladly munched on it until our salads arrived. The house dressing was the best part of this course. Soon after, our entrees arrived. My pork chop was cooked perfectly, very moist and tender. However, the fruit it was topped with (what appeared to be figs and plums) seemed to be tossed on top in very large chunks albeit whole pieces. I would have enjoyed this much more had the fruit been chopped into smaller pieces. I also did not care for the accompaning peppers. I was able to sneak in a few bites of hub's gnocchi and was much more impressed with his dish. Next course was our option of dessert. Hubs and I split the oreo mouse cake and took home the strawberry shortcake. The oreo mouse cake was definitely my favorite part of the meal. Overall, I would definitely go back to SL in the future if the opportunity presented itself."}
{"text":"I'm being kind with the three star rating since they just opened on Tuesday.  

It's a small carpeted space where the tables aren't on top of one another.  That was a plus.  We were greeted promptly with friendly service... Good there too.  BYOB so they opened our wine and filled water glasses.  Seemed good so far.  Everything was good until we ordered the entrees actually.  The beans and greens app was good. My husbands beet salad was okay.  Nobody told our server they were out of cavatelli so when my dish arrived with fettuccini I was surprised.  She took it back.  I had to choose something else (which was difficult as I had my heart set on cavatelli).  I chose the gnocchi with white truffle oil, etc.  I think I was just disappointed and did not enjoy it maybe bc I couldn't get what I wanted even though I was willing to try something else? I'm searching for a reason to feel like I do.  I will say that my hubby's gnocchi with wild boar was good (a little overdone).  I wish I ordered that but being it is lent, no meat for me (I only tried a smidgen of the sauce and some of the dumplings).  

We spent 80.00 for me to leave hungry.  I am sure it will get better, but just be prepared for decent service and meh food until they are firing on all cylinders (which is my hope... They improve soon after the kinks are worked out)."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try San Lorenzo, because a great Italian restaurant in Lawrenceville would be very convenient for me.  While this restaurant was okay, it's far from great. Making reservations was tedious and when we got there the restaurant was half empty. By 7:30, all of the specials on the menu were sold out (which was confusing because the restaurant was half empty). Most of the food on the menu is super heavy.  There are only two fish dishes available the night we ate there and neither was particularly memorable.  I definitely wouldn't dine here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time over the weekend. We live within walking distance and looking at the menu online got us in the mood for some Italian. The first thing we got served was bread. It was only three sort of dry pieces but when we asked for a refill they gave us another basket with softer and warmer bread. They were also very nice about bringing out a side of butter for my husband who prefers that to the olive oil/balsamic that they served us initially. For the appetizer we got the sauteed calamari. I am not a big tomato sauce fan, but this sauce was actually very tasty and we ate the entire appetizer. 

For entrees my husband got the pork chop and polenta and I got the seafood linguine pasta. His entree was huge and delicious. The chop was cooked well and the polenta was also a big winner. However the reason I didn't give them the five star rating because I wasn't a terrible fan of my pasta. The sauce was wine based which I usually like but  it was pretty bland tasting to me. The serving was large and there was plenty of seafood but I would have much rather had my husband's entree. 
 
The desserts sounded good but we were too full and on a time budget to get any. Next time we come we will BYOB and probably stay for dessert. Overall I would recommend it, but I would want to try another pasta dish before getting too excited about spreading the word."}
{"text":"A bit underwhelming and kinda \"Pittsburgh Italian\".  

Came here for Valentines Day and ordered the tasting menu, which looked fantastic. The oyster was kinda sketchy (and I love oysters to death) and it looked like a cheap gulf oyster. The pasta dishes were good but not particularly memorable. My fiance really enjoyed his fish course but my steak was very tough. The waitress agreed and reduced our check, which was very nice of her. 

The dessert was hysterical because it was so Pittsburgh, wrapped up like it was some authentic Italian delicacy when it was simply cake with some fancy sugar sauce. We couldn't stop laughing.  

Overall, ok meal and better than Alexander's in Bloomfield but we are still searching for real, fine Italian food in Pittsburgh. Any suggestions?"}
{"text":"I think you're going to love this place. It's warm, it's romantic, it's a little oasis of classic Italian in the center of the hipster ocean. 

San Lorenzo Ristorante had the most amazing fish special tonight. It was a pan-fried cod fillet, very generous and topped with perfectly steamed brussels sprouts and tart San Marzano tomatoes. The bottom of the fillet was light and crisp and the sweet white fish was a perfect match for the earthy brussels sprouts, rich pancetta and bright tomatoes. There was a small side of indulgent brown butter gnocchi. I neglected to ask if they were made in-house but these little pillows of heaven were very close to the gnocchi we had in Italy.

My fiancé ordered the bucatini with the San Marzano topping, three rounds of mozzarella and a light sprinkling of grated parmesan. The pasta was cooked just al dente and none of the flavors overwhelmed the other. Fresh basil was a standard accompaniment but it's hard to ruin that.

The bread provided before the entrées was standard Italian restaurant bread. However, it was lightly toasted which was a nice change. The dish of olive oil/balsamic was topped with a basil chiffonade but it could have used some more balsamic to round out the oil (we didn't ask for more...but should have).

Our waiter was wonderful. She was extremely pleasant, answered our questions about the menu and checked on us just enough but not too much.

For the pasta entrée, fish special, bread and a bottle of San Pellegrino, we dropped about $55 (including tip). For the quality of the food, the warmth of the staff and surroundings, it was well-worth each dime. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"First of all, for those of you who miss Cafe Vita in Oakmont, this is it (same owner and a lot of the same staff)! Second, just a note that the restaurant is BYOB, with a very reasonable corkage fee of $7.

We made a reservation; and, our table was set and ready for us when we walked in. The service was incredible - very attentive and friendly staff. The menu is small in size but big in flavor. We finished every single crumb of our appetizers, salads, entrees, and dessert. I all but licked my plate. We miss Cafe Vita's brunch in Oakmont but dinner was just as impressive. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was a terrific dinner spot. We had three different pastas; one had mussels, another had tomatoes and peppers, and a third had gnocchi, mushrooms and spinach. All three were great. The dessert, appetizer, and salads were terrific too. The sauce on the second pasta was sublime--perfect combination of items."}
