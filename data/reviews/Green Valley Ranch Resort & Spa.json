{"text":"it doesn't get better than green valley ranch sports-book.  1 dollar beer, 1 dollar hot dogs, turf grill only top of the line food and priced very good, plus free well drinks when you gamble (must get coupon when you place wager).  get there early and you get your own TV. booth., the waitresses are very thorough, they walk down every isle and ask everybody if the want a drink. unlike ceasers.  the whole right side is for football and the left is for horse racing,  but you can pretty much sit anywhere."}
{"text":"Sports book customer service is inconsistent and arrogant. Decent food joints but nothin to write home about."}
{"text":"This Hotel needs a serious clean sweep of its management. This should be a great place to stay, but as this is our 4th time, we are just prime examples of insanity, expecting different & better results from the same group.... Our first room was like, 78 degrees when we walked into it. We put the AC down to 65, went down to eat / play for 4 hrs....came back and temp said 76.....not cutting it....Maint said the AC needed rebooting (really?)...2 hours later it was still 76.....we got a lower floor....this time the room was ok, but took all evening to get down to 70. HEY.... in the summer, when the temps are over 90.....keep the rooms cool for the next arriving guests.....it might make their stay enjoyable..."}
{"text":"As of Aug 2017, resort fees included access to their AMAZING spa facilities and NO PARKING.  Main pool closes earlier than spa pool, but main jacuzzi remains open late into the evening.  super relaxing pool area, rooms feel like you're in Santa Barbara, but casino does have a lingering smoke smell.  easy access to outdoor District shops & restaurants.  will be returning!"}
{"text":"The GVR has clean rooms but can use some dusting as with many other parts of the hotel and casino. Definitely need to change their pool hours! Its summer and pools should at least be open till 10:30pm for god sakes it is hot out! Had dinner at the grand cafe.......its basically a Denny's potato was not cook and steak was over done beef jerky. Lucky they did have a fat burger in there that was awesome. The employees canuse a good six months of intense customer service. The casino I would not waste a dime here payouts are scarce."}
{"text":"I like the Casino. It is clean and they have a non-smoking section. They have a nice variety of slots and other coin-op games.  The only restaurant I've been to was the Fatburger where the prices are the same as outside of the casino. They also have Villa Pizza, Wing Stop, a buffet, and a Pancake House. Pancake House is a dependable chain so it's probably good in the casino too.  The casino also has a movie theater downstairs and outside the casino are various stores and restaurants."}
{"text":"I am incredibly displeased with this resort. I'm here for 9 days, have already been charged  $2500, and have received nothing but disappointment.  My room type was unfortunately not handled correctly despite assurances from staff EIGHT months ago, which is now being remedied by a stinking rolloway bed, which I have to pay $35 a night for, every time someone in the building uses a bathroom sink I need to listen to drain issues loudly gurgling at 5AM, and I waited I'm not kidding 46 minutes to  get a cab tonight.  I am extremely unhappy for the price I paid and highly recommend going somewhere else for this kind of money. At least comp me a night, or get me a room. Don't charge me another $200 for a rollaway bed."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect place to unwind and have fun.    Great casino - well designed, clean & modern.  Awesome Poker Room - pocket rockets please and diamonds for the Lady!!!  The Pool - snazzy & sophisticated - and a bit more welcoming of all age groups unlike the Palms & Planet Hollywood set.  For a great weekend with family, a corporate event or just with the Love of your Life - this place is very special."}
{"text":"Green valley ranch is the best ever! Great food great prices wonderful armoshphere and wonderful people! Service is always amazing and everyone is very helpful and friendly!!"}
{"text":"Great place for the money . Everything is located on property or across from it. All the staff are friendly.The rooms are great and are priced right ..We have a suite overlooking the pool and it's perfect. Glad we found this gem, as a frequent Vegas travler , this place is a fabulous alternative. There is a shuttle to strip and airport."}
{"text":"Great buffet. Very economical... When it comes to value versus price ... They send coupons for free buffets as to many other casinos but the buffet here is one of the best values. A lot of rewards available for members and points are easy to accumulate. Smells clean and it's a very nice addition to the Henderson area"}
{"text":"I really enjoy GVR. Like all the restruants and bars. Oh and of course The Original Pancake House is always on point."}
{"text":"I have a close friend who lives his life like a movie. But  then again, don't we all. But, my friend, we'll call him Bond, James Bond, lives his life as though the camera is always rolling. When ever he relates a story, he tells it like a movie. Filling in details about the scene, the actors motivations and even providing laugh tracks and applauses - where appropriate. Especially important is the scene - what was he wearing, what the other actors (real people to you and me) were wearing and there regard for the main character - Bond, James Bond. Anyway, he recently had an epiphany about an outfit - these slacks, with these shoes, belt and sport coat, etc. Next, he builds a scene where said outfit is ideal. Next he builds his ideal cast - all should be good looking, well-dressed and witty. Now what he has is a vacation - wherein he assembles cast, crew and scene to make the movie that is his life.   My recent vacation to Green Valley Ranch Resort (GVRR)was the result of just such an epiphany. So, me and my wife, Bond, James Bond and his wife and another couple who we'll only refer to here as \"Lensica\" struck out for an adults-only weekend at GVRR.   GVRR is a nice, fully contained resort in thr outskitr city of Henderson, Nevada. About twenty minutes from the strip it appears to be in an upscale part of Greater Las Vegas. They have all the requisite amenities one would expect in a resort - casino, clubs, restaurants of different genres, pool and cabana area and spa. Despite the hokey name, the resort has an Italianate architecture. It looks to be relatively new and thus has bit of a \"tract home\"-new feel. This isn't a knock against the place, but is pretty typical of LV as most of it pretty recent.  Food - I love hamburgers! I may have said that before. Well, in the food court, they have a FatBurger! That carries a lot of weight for me. You can always rely on a quality burger from this place. Enuf said. On the high end, they have Hanks Steakhouse. Good steaks. It's typically expensive but I have to say the service was both attentive and completely unobtrusive. In addition, they have a Sushi restaurant - good but nothing to right home about. Finally, the big draw based on the unbelievable lines - an Original Pancake House. Never got in there, but if it's like Fatburger, you can count on it to be as good (or bad) as the other OPHs.  Room Service - Had the pre-ordered breakfast and it cam right on time. A bit on the expensive side, and they don't have any griddle dishes - hotcakes, etc. That was tough, but the food they served was quite tasty.   General Service - All the staff was unfailingly friendly, polite and helpful. I give them high marks for understanding the the idea of hospitality.   Pool/Patio - On Saturday, while the ladies \"spa'd\" (if that is a word) while the guys sat around and drank by the pool. We rented a cabana in the Adults only pool area. It had a bit of a Spring Break feel even though many of the swimmers were significantly older than college age. The service around the pool was a bit slow. Worse, we ordered food and of the 5 dishes ordered, two had substantial errors - sandwiches missing the bread, no avocado on a Cobb salad. However, once we brought this to the attention of the Assistant Pool Manager - she comped the $200 cabana fee and well as our drinks and food. She gets the highest marks! Her level of service gets the resort a whole star. If you there, ask for Styrling. She'll take care of ya.  The biggest downside would be distance from the Strip. Not a big problem, but definitely inconvenient if the strip is on your agenda.  Overall, I can recommend this place. It's a good place to go in Vegas."}
{"text":"Just returned from this property. The physical structure was fine. It is the staff and food quality that really needs fixing. The front desk, with huge lines, had staff members in nonsense chit chat.  In a town that thrives on hospitality service you won't find decent service here. I attended a group dinner. The servers place 3 meals at the 8 top and left. The food was bland at best. The servers in the restaurants were very slow and inept. Even the Fatburger place in the food court had trouble putting  burger together.In the east wing we had the single serve coffee makers. The place is in a great location and enjoyed going to the district for shopping and dining.But, I would never stay here again."}
{"text":"I truly love this place, but my last experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I was playing blackjack, and betting for the dealers like I always do. My second to last bet I put $5 for me and $1 for the dealer. I luckily had the opportunity to double down. I put $5 more for me and $1 more for the dealer. \"We\" pushed the hand. The dealer, Chantel, said \"I'm taking this!\" even though we pushed. She then took the $2 tip! Completely unprofessional and the Pit Boss could give a shit. I call bull shit."}
{"text":"I love GVR! I am a local and I enjoy staying here to get away from the city, it's like my own paradise. We got a deal on groupon, our was clean and nice as always comfortable beds and we got the west tower with a great view of the pool.  My BF and I had a couples scrub and an 80 min massage, ask for Rachel she is Fabulous, I have back issues and she took all the knots out . The spa itself is smaller than those on the strip but I like the quietness and private pool area, clean with all essentials you may need and a nice co ed area, that has a hot tub, a local discount as well and they add the gratuity but ask you if you want to modify it to more or less. Poolside had drinks and lunch, the buss boy was very nice delivered the food picked up after us and friendly. My only complaint was as others have mentioned the cocktail service. I don't know if its because the bar is far away from the spa pool or because there were not very many guest but it took a very long time to get drinks . She was nice and friendly but the drinks just took too long, we had eaten our lunch by the time she came around to ask if we wanted another round of drinks. Overall great relaxing sunny day at pool and spa and would recommend to everyone !  Oooo upon check in they gave us a $35 off a spa service, as well.  We are going to Hanks for dinner so ill post a review on that later."}
{"text":"Sat at the pool for an hour without a server coming by. Had to go to the bar and order food and drinks. Oscar...the Spa Manager...was not helpful at all with a problem we had at the spa. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"While it's a beautiful place, we had a highly unfortunate experience here. Though we prepaid for our reservation 10 days in advance, they gave away our room and stuck us in a smoking room, which REEKED. To our discredit, we did check in very late. However, we received no phone call before they gave the room away.  When we complained, they offered to give us some ozone machines, but otherwise couldn't (or wouldn't) do anything else for us except offer us a refund. I don't mind that the answer was no, but the manner in which we were treated implied that WE were the jerks and they did nothing wrong.   Also, when you book a room, note the mandatory \"amenity fee\", which I really feel is a  sneaky way of saying the rooms are $28 a night more expensive than some us think they are.  I've been in nicer hotels than this, and I don't think the amenities at this location are particularly impressive, so I feel it's just a cheap trick.   The room was very nice, though I was a little disappointed at the quality of the linens. I'm used to better at these prices.  Overall? Meh."}
{"text":"So, my bf got me out of the house for the weekend - destination Vegas.  We were there Sat & Sun.... and trust me, it was NOT cheap for the weekend.  (I travel a lot)  Let me first say, I spent a good amount of my visit GVR at the spa, pool area.  I had no problems with the casino, nor the hotel areas.  It was my first time here, and I was excited about going.  I use spas often when I travel, as a time to relax and unwind.  However, this spa experience was very annoying.... And, the oddest thing happened.... I had an experience where a spa attendant(s) told me  \"YOU can't USE  the lockers, because we have SPA guest coming with appointments.\"  Literally, the moment I get to the door of the SPA, some woman stops me and says they are short on lockers.. and she says I can't use one--- she damn near blocked the door to the entrance.  I came back out, and luckily caught my bf before he went in to his locker room area, and  So, I had my BF to put my PURSE in his locker while I worked out at the fitness center.  Day 2... IT HAPPENED AGAIN... I was STOPPED A 2ND TIME by A DIFFERENT attendant... who said, \"oh, our services were all booked up, and we only have about 3 lockers left, so you can't really have a locker, we are \"holding\" them for people who are having a service. I had checked the front desk, and they certainly had appointments available, I asked, and they were willing to book me a massage.  I said to the 2nd attendant (cause I was unfamiliar on how to use the lockers), okay, I asked woman #2... (how would I know if one was not attended?) and she told me how to use them... But, after she left, i went back to look, and there, were certainly more than 3 available lockers. WHO STOPS people from using LOCKERS?? And, more importantly, how is it that there are not enough lockers?  MY bf said he it was probably something else going on, and I should let it go... but, i can't, so Im writing this so that maybe I can get past it... However, I have not read ANY OTHER REVIEW OF PEOPLE who have had this issue with GVR... I'm so disappointed, I wanted to like this place, but I will certainly dissuade him from going to this property again, because we can spend our hard earned money elsewhere.  This review was not for the restaurant... it was for Golden Valley Ranch Spa."}
{"text":"GVR is an awesome locals spot, the casino has everything you need and out back there are two separate pools, one for the adults who like to have fun, as well as a huge hotel community pool with a beach sand bottom to really set your vacation like mood. This is definitely a once a week stop for me,"}
{"text":"It's where I call home when I go to Vegas...along with sister property Red Rock Station...great staff and plenty to do at both"}
{"text":"Green Valley is a beautiful resort and I usually enjoy ever moment of visiting. However, I visited the pool for the second time and I was a little disappointed. The food was decent and our cabana server was really sweet, but there was one gentleman who appeared to be a pool manager that noticed a glass beer bottle sitting along the pool. He began to yell at all the guest that were in the water \"who's bottle is this?\" Once the guest admitted it was his the manager began pointing saying \"there's no glass allowed at the pool.\" He rolled his eyes at the guest then walked away. The pool manager appeared very upset. I understand that pools have rules and glass is dangerous at pools, but I feel he could have enforced the rules with some respect after all he was talking to an adult not a child! The two stars is for the manager that yells at his guest!"}
{"text":"I stayed here back in March and this was one of the most beautiful hotels that I've been to.   I didn't get to experience all of the facilities, but a lot of what they had to offer seemed very nice.  My only complaint was that to go to the casino from your room is wayyy too long of a walk and and there isn't much of a selection from the gift shops at that hotel.   The room we got was very lovely!  It wasn't a suite,  but it almost felt like we were in one and the bathrooms are absolutely beautiful!  Very clean and relaxing atmosphere.  This is a good place to go if you want to get away from the strip.  I'd only stay here again if I didn't plan on leaving the hotel to go to other places."}
{"text":"My wife and I go here for stay-cations... Awesome pool.   Great rooms for the price and lots of excellent restaurants."}
{"text":"Booked this hotel casino for a group over Memorial weekend.  They charged a $500 deposit for the reservation back in March.  We stayed and now it has been almost a month and they still have not credited back the deposit they charged us.  They are really quick to charge but still haven't given us our money back.  On top of that I was just charged another $98 for some unknown reason 2 weeks after our stay.  Have emailed and they said 2 weeks ago someone named Lisa would get in touch and credit us back.  That still hadn't happened and never got a receipt or any info on the additional $98 charge that happened 2 weeks after our stay.  Pretty shady business practices.  Resort was fine but this incredibly poor experience, lack of communication and under handed business dealing will have our group never stay there again.  Will be contacting my bank and our attorney.  People staying there need to be very careful about extra charges and deposits.  Too many other places to stay to have to constantly deal with this to ever stay there or recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ate at green valley ranch buffet apparently Mgr Jack is a Doctor and yelled at us that 20 ft farther than where we requested to sit will not matter when someone is smoking, especially with a newborn baby. Please tell me smoking directly next to a slot machine is the same as 20 ft away from where someone is smoking.  Not!   A guy who does not handle this type of adversity and displays zero customer service skills should not be working here.    This was during a slow time during the day.   Can't imagine how he works during a busy time of the day."}
{"text":"A 5 star experience from walking in the hotel lobby to checking out!"}
{"text":"Ate the Sunday Champagne Brunch at the Feast Buffet at Green Valley Ranch on Sunday Jan. 29th. Have eaten at the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station several times with good results. Thought the Buffet at Green Valley Ranch would be better, but I was wrong.  The service was awful.  My servers name was Tish or Trish and all she had to do was bring a glass of champagne every 10 minutes or so, and she couldn't figure out how to do that.  There was an elderly gentleman sitting at the table next to mine and he physically stood up, got out of his chair and tried unsuccessfully to waive someone down 3 times so he could get some coffee.  I finally went to the hostess and explained the problem, and she brought us some more champagne and a pot of coffee for the gentleman at the next table, but the service didn't improve after that.   The Sunday brunch at Green Valley Ranch costs $4 more than the Brunch at Sunset Station as well, so I paid more for bad service. The food was the same as that which you'll find at Sunset Station as well. Save your money and stay away from this place."}
{"text":"By far my favorite casino to lose my money and sometimes win.  They have a nice food court selection, a variety of other great dining choices.  The dealers here are very friendly.  Tam, Manny, and Joe are some of my favorites at the craps tables.  They remember how you like to play and take care of it for you.  They will help you if there is something you don't know.  Sometimes they give you advice if they think you should do something different from what you originally wanted to do which often keeps you playing longer.  The air system in here is pretty good.  You don't get too smokey unless sitting by a smoker of course. . ."}
{"text":"This review is for the spa only.  I am a local and received a gift card for the hotel so we thought we would spend it at the spa.  I know what your thinking, how could anyone complain when it's free AND complain about a spa!  When we first arrived we were checked in by a friendly staff member and we told her it was our first time visiting.  She walked us to the stairs and said the service staff will then take care of our lockers, etc downstairs. The service staff retrieved our spa shoes and locker keys and left us guessing after that.  I said it's our first time here - where do we go?  He pointed us to the Men/Women rooms where he said the lockers were and that the massage therapist would pick us up in there.  This is where I got upset. No tour, had no idea where anything was, pretzels on the floor, kleenex dispenser empty, no toiliet paper in the stall, stall door lock was broke, candles weren't lit etc.  As I sat in the lounge to wait for my massage, I overheard a staff member giving a \"tour\" to another lady.  Wow - where did I go wrong after telling them 3 times that we had never been there! (once over the phone).  The massage was great as was the therapist Jennifer.  After the massage Jennifer told us about the couples Jacuzzi.  We got dressed and went to the Jacuzzi, tried to turn it on - no bubbles!  I asked a therapist if I was turning it on incorrectly and she stated that the bubbles weren't working but you can still sit in it.  What?  I can sit in my hot bath tub at home if that was the case!  Needless to say, we left after I couldn't charge my cocktail I ordered to my spa account at their private pool.  Upon checkout, we didn't even receive a thank you, come back soon, nothing.  Therefore, we will never be back and I would never recommend this spa."}
{"text":"Considering I just wrote a review about the horrible part of my Las Vegas trip, I might as well pay a compliment!  I stayed at GVR on NYE for the first time, and it was absolutely gorgeous.  Our flight arrived way before our check-in time, but we were still able to check into a room - which was great.  The customer service is amazing, both in the hotel, casino, and the sushi restaurant I ate in that night.  The room was clean, a decent size (standard room)... and had everything we needed in it.  It was nice to stay in a good resort, and not be on the strip!  Everything was clean, exceeded my standards, and was the ONLY positive thing about my trip to Vegas!  The pool area outside is absolutely amazing, I wish it had been warmer outside!  I most certainly plan on coming back to this resort.  The ONLY word of caution I have (which isn't a big thing at all)... is pay attention to their shuttle times.  Coming from the airport, I believe they only run once every 3 hours or so.  I had to get a cab over to the resort, which isn't the end of the world - but if you can book your flight properly so you have time to catch the shuttle, why not!"}
{"text":"Horrible buffet if you are planning on taking children....it's 18 dollars for a 2yr old \"No thanks\" also not a great variety of food table service was the only tolerable thing here."}
{"text":"Upscale station casino. All the usual slots here, $60 buy in poker tourneys and a nice sports book. Two nice food spots, Hanks and the Italian place. I also like the movies here. The pool is great and hidden!"}
{"text":"I went to the spa and got a facial and a pedicure! I loved the facial, it was phenomenal and the atmosphere was so relaxing!!! The only bad thing I would say is if you are trying to have a spa day it's kind of a bummer to go from that to the salon for a pedicure, it's not as relaxing."}
{"text":"Great hotel to stay at to avoid the busy traffic on the strip. Really enjoyed this facility and casino. We will return."}
{"text":"Not new 21 friendly. It is definitely a place for an older crowd. It definitely isnt lively or clean, and there are far better station casinos. Although they have non smoking areas thd smell is worse than most of the strip casinos."}
{"text":"I went to the salon here, and I was seen by Julie Brock. I have been going to her for some time, she is so amazing, and she was so thorough with my consult. I am a blonde and to keep that up it takes a lot of work. She always is giving me the best advise for my hair, as well as keeping me up to date with all the fashion trends! Julie always takes her time and does what is best for your hair! She does a super great job on my hair, I love it!! I would defiantly recommend her for a hair stylist!! So make sure you visit her at the Green Valley Ranch Casino Salon!!"}
{"text":"To all my peeps. If you are thinking about going to Vegas you should check out and Stay at the Green Valley Resort and Casino.... Realy I went there once and spent about $200. and made sure I got a casino players card. I have been getting letters and post cards from them for free stays and about 4 months ago I got a fr...ee 4 day 3 night stay and a entered in to an invite only slot tournament with $5000 in winnings.  If you think you will be going to Vegas a lot this is the place to go.   The rooms are big, clean, and very nice...   Just dont drink or eat from the minny bar. $10 for a Beer. $3 for a candy bar. $5 for a bottle of water. Just go down to the casino and play some slots and get all the drinks you can handle...."}
{"text":"Stayed last month and I enjoy it. Clean and the pool area is the highlight.  Place is big even it is hard to find the lobby, got plenty to do, however the room size is very average, I dislike the location, it takes too long to get to strip the main area"}
{"text":"I was surprised. This resort was better than I anticipated. This is a great resort for families and couples. Fantastic pool and movie theater.  This would not be a great resort for singles lookin for fun. Its quite the expensive taxi ride from the strip."}
{"text":"living just down the street we end up there a lot, nice casino, the theater is good, not great, and the food is decent, but the district is just outside with lots of great food choices."}
{"text":"I stayed there back in 2008 and had an enjoyable stay.  I have never stayed off the strip before when coming to the Las Vegas area but this trip was completely comped so of course I took it.  It definitely had a slower-paced and quieter, more tranquil feel.  If you are older (middle aged on up or so) you would definitely find this place to be great.  There are bars in the hotel but the hotel definitely does not have a party atmosphere.  I missed the energy, fun and party lifestyle of being on the strip.  If, however, you are looking for a nice, clean, quiet place to enjoy Vegas, this place is the best.  The poolside cabanas were great, with well-stocked beverages, a flat screen, and comfy seats but the pool beside the cabanas was small (long and narrow).  I got a massage at the spa which was incredible so I will go out of my way to return there for that reason alone."}
{"text":"Hotel staff not as friendly as the other stays. They over promised and never delivered. Such a shame. It's such a nice property."}
{"text":"I was a guest to your seafood buffet and enjoyed my meal. The food was great. The service was lacking. First was the wait to pay. The person who treated is a member of your chairman's club. The wait to pay was about long.  There was nobody ahead of us in line. There was no cashier. Most disturbing was how drinks were served..... Fingers in glasses.!!! Uck!!!!  How many dirty plates, silverware and used glasses does a server pick up a shift? The same hands and fingers were in and on top of our drinks. It may seem like such a small thing but how many germs, viruses and diseases are spread in warm moist environments? While the food was good I do not think we will be returning."}
{"text":"All the luxury you crave when in Vegas without the heart stopping bill.    Why bother going into Vegas when you can have all the glamour right here in Henderson without all the crowds? Whether I am staying here or not, the buffet here is the first and last place I hit when going to Vegas. I can not say enough good things about this buffet.  REALLY!  I am a buffet snob.  I love buffets but I hate canned crap.  I want great food and lots of it.  I am indesisive so buffets are my style. This one is HUGE.  About 2000 sq feet of just food, the dining area adds another 2000 sq. feet.   Assuming it is dinner time we will be Starting on the right where we begin with Asian fare; all the most popular dishes (about 12).  Next is the Mongolian BBQ style area, pick your meats and veggies and the chef whips them up in front of you.  Move on over to the Mexican food area for about a half dozen of your most popular dishes including hand made tortillas at the taco bar, enchiladas, chile realleno, etc.  Now, we venture over to Italian (about 6 entrees plus pizza), my son's fav is next; seafood.  I think they outdo themselves here.  The obligatory fried and breaded white fish & chips & fried shrimp are out shone by stuffed mussells, shrimp scampi, stuffed blue crab and salmon filets.  My brother opts for the Prime rib sliced to order.  Want it thick rather than wafer thin?  No prob.  He had his 1/2 inch thick.  On a diet?  Have the roast turkey or ham followed up or proceded by the gargantuan salad bar.  Nothing canned here, all fresh.  Trying to keep Kosher?  They have a small section of that also. End your meal in the seperate dessert area complete with a large selection of sugar free dessert in addition to the kid's favorite; the sundae bar and soft serve ice cream.  I'll have some cheese cake please. After the stomach numbing gorge at the buffet, mosey on over to the casino and shuffle off the kiddies to the great play area (arcade) and movie theatre.  A three story shopping mall attaches to the resort so while you play golf or gamble the wife and young'ns can be out of your hair.  Or, send your better half off to thier amazing spa for some r & r.  If you chose to stay here (highly recommended): Every room is luxuriously appointed with down comforters, down pillows and fiber filled ones too, comfy terry cloth robes (just in case you forgot yours) and exceptional free goodies in additon to some unusual pay as you use em stuff.  The bathrooms are like a private spa with overlarge seperate tubs and showers.  Even the potty has it's own little room complete with a phone. The entire place is decorated in antique reproduction furniture with plenty of marble and decorative wrought iron.  It all comes together for a warm and friendly experience worth repeating over and over again!"}
{"text":"After much time spent researching the best spa to get a gift certificate for my mother in law we decided on your spa.  I called several times but nobody answered. Finally  someone answered and said they had been having issues with their phone service.  I understood and asked to purchase a gift certificate to be emailed for a gift.  I was advised I would have to fax my photo Iid, and front and back of my credit card. Then once approved they could not email the gift certificate.  Wasted hours researching, trying to call, then told  could not purchase on the phone and I was not near a fax. For such a big, high end hotel it is ridiculous to not be able to give money and business either on line or by phone.  When charging top dollar 140  plus for a fifty minute massage it's not fair you wasted so much of my time."}

{"text":"I am some what of a hotel snob. I am picky and expect a lot. GVR went above and beyond. Gorgeous grounds and wonderful service. Pool was mellow, not crowded and was very relaxing. Room was clean and well appointed. Can't wait to come back and spend some time here. Thanks GVR for making our get away exactly what we were looking for!"}
{"text":"Good staff, awesome spa, and right next to The District for you to spend whatever money you have left!  I Only wish you could buy movie tickets and reserve your seat before you arrive."}
{"text":"We stayed here for cake camp and really enjoyed our time there. It's pretty easy to find your way around once you know where you are going. It always seamed really really cold in there but apparently it was 70 something. Sure as Hell felt like the low 60's. Our room was nice and clean. The bathroom was awesome. There where a few things wrong in the room but other than that the hotel staff was very helpful and was always on the ball. The pool was Awesome!!!!  We are planning on staying here again at our next convention."}
{"text":"Feast Buffet is one of the best that I have had.  The crab legs being sautéed is so good that I am willing to drive to LV from CA just to have it."}
{"text":"I had my wedding ceremony at Green Valley Ranch two days after Christmas. I could not have asked for a more perfect wedding! Not only do I live out of state, I also planned everything in 3 months. The entire time I worked with Penny, the catering manager, and she was AWESOME! Since I live out of state, most of my communication with her was through email.  The day of the wedding, everything was absolutely perfect! Because I got married outside (not the smartest thing to do in winter), we had space heaters and a hot beverage bar. Penny helped coordinate everything from the space heaters, to the flower delivery, to the beverage set up. Almost every single guest has called/texted in the last week to rave about the ceremony! They were all highly impressed! There's no way I could have pulled off such a great ceremony in 3 months without Penny's expertise and hard work!"}
{"text":"Love this casino!  The smoke isn't too bad, and everything is in great condition. The food options are awesome.  The theater can get a little crowded."}
{"text":"Great last minute deal on mobile while still at airport. Beautiful rooms. Only criticism is that if you arrive with your own car/rental you have to park pretty far away and it's quite a maze to get to the lobby."}
{"text":"What a disappointing experience! I am a local and was excited to finally try staying at Green Valley Resort with my sister when she visited. I had heard wonderful things about the GVR's pool, spa, and overall experience. Was I shocked and disappointed at the service we received! I called GVR to make my reservation using the zoohotel.com price quote which included free drinks and some other items. Upon my arrival at the front desk check-in, the receptionist seemed to question my purchase and did not give me any of the items or free perks listed when I made my reservation. The receptionist was unfriendly and not helpful.  Our room was clean. The service at the spa was some of the friendliest service we experienced throughout our stay. On the flipside, the server at the pool was extremely slow and the food that was brought out to us was cold.  Poor service may make more sense during a busy time, but we were there on a nearly empty weekday!   To top it off, as a local, I was excited to see the staff wearing \"I Love Local\" pins but was extremely disappointed when I asked what the local benefits were - the woman at check-in brushed it off my question and gave me a weird look for even asking. Apparently, they just wear the button, there is no preferential or discounts for locals.   The whole experience was such a disappointment! And it was an embarrassment for me with how much I had talked up GVR to my visiting sister.  Bummed out!! And will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"They will grill your crab with garlic and green onions if you ask. Delicious - the taste is reminiscent of Crustaceans."}
{"text":"Bathrooms are nice.  Bed firm and comfortable.  \"Down comforter\" had hard clumps all over (see picture).   This hotel is off the strip, so a little quieter scene.  Transportation to and from the airport sub par for a place off strip.  Shuttle service only runs every two hours and then only if you can get one of the limited seats.  Because we our flight time did not line up well with the shuttle schedule we decided to take a cab.  What we weren't prepared for was the half hour wait for a cab.  Overall, not worth the money."}
{"text":"Green Valley Ranch Resort is outstanding!  However, the spa leaves you ultimately disappointed in the entire place if ever you go there.  Had 3 massages w/my 2 best friends for our local girlfriend get away.  Room was nice, restaurants and gaming area great!  However, the spa was HORRIBLE!  The front desk girl acted like we were a burden to be waited on even when we went to pay our huge bill.  All of us make good money and are professional ladies.  We don't drink at a spa or act up-we are the guests of an establishment and we treat it as we would want a guest in our own homes.  So there was no reason for the treatment we got.  The rest of the staff was ok.  Not rude but the massages and treatments were that of a training school level-yet some of the MOST expensive we have ever paid for!  And they made the 20% tip mandatory for our party of THREE!  Which was not acceptable because the treatments were all very poor and the tip would have reflected it.  Did write a letter to the spa mgr of our treatment and poor quality massages and part of our bill was refunded, but this is not what we wanted.  We really wanted to amazing experience that GVR spa should have been able to of delivered as a true reflection of the prices they charge and the level of the rest of the property.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Great hotel and location! Not too close to the hustle and bustle of the Strip, which I like. It's a very inviting and clean establishment! They also have great restaurants from pancakes to buffets or a good tasty steak. There is ample parking which is very easy to access.   What I also like about Green Valley is that it's close to an open mall, so if you feel like escaping the smoky casino and wondering through some \"real stores\", you're not too far away.  Wonderful hidden casino!"}
{"text":"Really nice rooms.  Although the original tower is older, it is maintained very well.  Staying in this building can potentially save a ton of walking.  The newest rooms are really far from the lobby and the main casino.  Several years ago I asked for one of the 'new rooms'.  I had no idea that I'd have to walk to the 215!  And when my room key didn't work at 4am, it was waaay easier to use the house phone and wait in the hall than walk all the way to the lobby.  All of their rooms are very nice though.  Nice beds, nice amenities, and a very upscale feel.  The casino has definitely improved over the years since they first opened.  Added a poker room, expended the casino, and added an extra pit.  AND they recently brought back the Grand Cafe! ----- really good breakfast.  Their buffet is the best of all of the Station's buffets.  They dropped the crab legs when the prices were lowered about a year ago, but for $14 the dinner is well worth it.  All in all GVR is still a really nice property."}
{"text":"I go to Vegas fairly frequently to visit family, attend weddings/bachelor parties, and collect samples for my sand collection.  The Strip is cool, and if you are visiting Vegas for the first time you must stay somewhere on Strip.  If you want something more mellow, consider Green Valley.  Two of my friends friends got hitched at the resort  and I stayed in the hotel.  Amazingly, the king I requested was actually there waiting for me. So rare these days.  Service was perfect from the start.  They had me settled in my room in no time, which was great.  The rooms are very nice, the bathrooms large and nicely appointed.    The spa is a big winner.  You can use it as part of your hotel reservation.  I love that spa.  I hate to be the guy who talks about how great his steam was, but there it is.  I had a kick-ass steam.  There, I said it.  Get steamed up, cool off in the whirlpool, shave, shower, and watch a little women's softball.  Pretty nice.  From my perspective, the hotel knew how to handle a wedding, too.  They held it on the Grand Staircase and it was very beautiful and went smoothly.  I wept, then went and took another steam."}
{"text":"Billboard says California Residents get a discount but at check in, no one had the authority to apply it.  Jessica the Night Auditor was very rude.  GM does not care because multiple messages at front desk and via telephone, she does not return calls.  I call and they route me to other people's boxes when I ask for the GM."}
{"text":"Great for those not wanting to hit the strip but wanting to relax with family, in town to visit family or locals wanting to escape for a night.  Great rooms, ranch style atmosphere, awesome pool area, walk across the street to the mall or to a restaurant."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we had a large family reunion at GVR.....the sales peoples attitudes are absolutely rude.  We had arbitrary charges on our bills for unauthorized cleaning fees and room charges that were completely bogus.  The management (we were told that there is no GM) is aweful and treats their customers very poorly.  We spent many thousands of dollars at GVR and Hanks and I regret every cent.  Most of the family members were completely disgusted after four days stay.  I understand that STATION Casinos has been in bankrupcy and after staying at GVR, it is my opinion that they need to get some resort management in charge or kiss their backsides goodbye. Needless to say, most of us have called our credit card companies and disputed our GVR charges.......they ruined much of our stay. If you stay at GVR, I recommend that you do not give them your credit card....."}
{"text":"Hotel is nice but the payout on their slots are not great... i bet they are making a lot of money but that is how it works...."}
{"text":"Nice rooms, but shower is terrible because it leaks all over through the door, otherwise it is nice.  But coffee shop downstairs serves no hot coffee drinks with non-dairy, so no soy latte (sounds like amateur baristas).  Only cold coffee drinks with soy.  Oh well. Asked for late check out, we were denied, and not politely, the response was abrupt and borderline rude.  Another guest came down at 8am to the lobby complaining that he was paying a lot and was being disturbed by a very loud Zumba class going on at the pool.    No late check out No non-dairy coffee drinks (allergic to dairy) And very loud Zumba class that started at 7:30am  I won't be back to this location, but I do like Henderson area."}
{"text":"This hotel is great.  Especially if you have guests in town.  The prices are reasonable and the accommodations are terrific.   The pool and spa are the most impressive attributes.  Only drawback is that it is a 15 minute drive to the strip."}
{"text":"As far as the best casino resort goes in Henderson This is the place!!! My gf loves going to the spa, I like hitting up the buffet. Since this isnt near the strip the people are more high class here. Its a very nice location, the scenery is beautiful as well. Overall this is my 2nd to favorite place to go, the first being Red Rock resort. But this one is right down the road from me, and its good enough to where I dont have any interest going to Red Rock."}
{"text":"The reason I am leaving 3 stars is when I stayed there 7-6 to 7-9 there was some sort of dance competition going on with tweens and teen aged girls.  COMPLETELY ruined my peaceful getaway to Henderson.  They were loud and their moms were letting them run amuck. Las Vegas is not a place to bring teenagers. The adults who are paying for a vacation for peace and quiet did not get it.  The staff was courteous and polite and all went above and beyond for us. Except some person who answered the phone who called herself \"Kathy\" she was rude and told the assistant manager when I reported a bottle of patron missing from our room.  The assistant manager was a sweetheart and the poor lady was getting chewed out by a dance mom when we went to go see her.  We didn't yell at her. It was not her fault some things weren't getting done.  We were told that they removed the patron bottles for \"expiration date\" purposes. We think one of the staff was stealing them because other guests stated to us that the bottles were missing from their rooms as well. Some of the housekeeping staff decided not to clean our room after our first night. But once I told the front desk they sent someone right away. I will give the staff props for trying to make things right whenever I presented a concern....except when I was put on hold for 20 mins and the operator never returned when I was calling to report the missing patron bottle from our room.    Check-In was extremely painful I think it was due to the dance moms and their kids. Now don't get me wrong, I like children, I LOVE them actually but these bunch of girls made me want to blow my brains out....and I was on VACATION!  We had booked our stay so we could see Jeff Timmons perform. We were disappointed we weren't offered a discount. We saw him perform at the Rio last year with the Chippendale's and they offered us special packages to stay at their hotel.   This resort was just beautiful. There is a target down the street and a cheesecake factory all located near the resort. I fell in love with the place my last night there.  If I ever get married, I want to do it here. The rates are very reasonable and the grounds are beautiful....but I have yet to check out Caesar's Palace. ha ha  This is definitely a great place to stay off the strip. I love Las Vegas but as I get older I like a bit of serenity on vacation and Green Valley's property offers that.   I just hope in the future they don't hold dance competitions on the weekend I am staying there."}
{"text":"We stayed here for Labor Day weekend . The hotel was very nice. The pool was nice and safe for my child  I was a bit disappointed because they didn't offer any coupons or free buffet like other hotels ... But did I mention the buffet was good for breakfast  the room was big and clean . AC WORKED perfect"}
{"text":"We were very excited to stay here for a Baseball Tournament.  Our excitement quickly was squashed by the front desk clerk.  We asked if we could get rooms close to the other players/teams and we were told we will get what they have available.  So of course our room was in the complete opposite end of the hotel than most of the other players.  Then the valet proceeded to STEAL my Oakley Sunglasses from our rental car.  Only when I called and asked to file a security report did they magically appear.  They said I must have left them at the front desk at checkout.  That's interesting, considering I used express checkout from the TV and at no time did I stop by the front desk.  So don't leave ANY valuables in your car while staying at this resort."}
{"text":"Great Location! Very nice rooms and pool. Great food. The district is really nice. The machines are not the best though."}
{"text":"We made a reservation about a week before our arrival, and we told them we would be arriving later in the evening. When we got there they said they no longer had the rooms we reserved, all they had was a smoking room, and a king room. We were paying almost full price a they basically said that is the way it is. The customer service at the registration desk is horrible and the policy to give rooms to the first knew who arrive even if they didn't reserve the room in advance is ridiculous. I will not be staying here again. I would say that if you are going to stay here make sure you get here early. I have heard from several people that this same thing has happened to them. Not a good policy."}
{"text":"Poker everyday at starting 10AM A bit clicky (players know one another) but seems OK and was not judged, I was out in 10 min as 2 bad beats in a row, only $45 to play so very cost friendly."}
{"text":"Very nice room.  Management and service I would definitely rate poor.  My wife and I were part of a large group, and it seemed that our needs overall were just ignored.  Almost no one in this group wants to come back.  I felt a real cheapness when I set up my laptop and found that there was no wi-fi, unless you paid, starting at about $15.00, and going up from there in three different levels of internet speed.  How tacky!"}
{"text":"Great buffet, but super tight slot machines. Spent $800. On slot machines in less than an hour. I wouldn't mind loosing this money but I wasn't expecting this amount to last less than an hour."}
{"text":"Recently spent the long weekend at this resort. I probably would have given them a 4-5 star rating, but for a very poor experience we had at the pool facilities. We had called down to the concierge about renting a cabana or \"lounge couch\". We were told the cabanas were all sold out and we could get one of the lounge couches for half price since it would be around 2:00 before we got there, if any were still available. We went down, there was one available. The first person we spoke to was very helpful. We mentioned what the concierge told us about price, she said no problem. She found us a couch, had someone bring over an umbrella for shade, and left us to the server. Meaghan, the server, came over and started quoting a full day price. We again said we were told something different. She immediately copped an attitude, stormed away to speak to the first person, stormed back and told us that we would have to pay a \"holiday rate\", but she would cut that rate in half. Should've left, but we had friends coming and decided to enjoy the sun there. We rarely saw the server. When we did she would very pleasant with the people on the next couch (they hold 4 people easily), but quite short with us. Take forever to bring drinks, leave them sitting in the sun at the couch if we were in the pool (she brought others their drinks in the pool routinely). I guess this rating is for Meaghan, not the resort. However, we won't be back, and I wouldn't recommend you stay there either. Casino staff were awesome, had a great time in there. Room was good too. Too bad the experience/stay was ruined by 1 person."}
{"text":"Station Casinos latest way to prey on locals is their 'Boarding Pass Specials'. The offer does not reveal in fine print or anywhere else that to get the 'special price' you also have to buy a beverage at $2.75 or more for EACH offer.   We ordered all you can eat pancakes $2.99, and bacon cheeseburger for $3.99 - and then forced to spend $5.50 for two sodas. No where does the offer reveal this hidden requirement, so before you head out to Green Valley Resort or any other Station Casino, thinking you are going to get a meal deal, Beware.  Station casions say \"We Love Locals\" but what they forget is we can also go to South Point, PT's, The M, and a myriad of other places and bypass our Green Valley \"neighborhood casino\" for years to come."}
{"text":"Green Valley Ranch resort and casino is by far one of the friendliest local casinos, I would say 99% of the staff is always smiling, having a good time and all have a sense of humor.  The restaurants are amazing.  I know a lot of people are always searching for a good buffet, Ive been here locally for 6 years currently and they never disappoint. If you want the \"bang for your buck\". The Feast Buffet here is the spot.  I am also doing a review on their slots, very loose and be sure to get your rewards card in order to get all the great benefits, no matter if your visiting or you just moved here.  One particular new slot that I am doing a review on Power House Poker - PLAYED NICKEL MACHINE WITH $20, this is a fun game, the random selection of bonuses are actually quite frequent here at green valley ranch.  If your into the multiple hand bonus games, this is quite fun, it's a little similar to Double pay  poker, if that is the type of slot machine you are into, then you might enjoy this one.  I would recommend this to everyone visiting/locals."}
{"text":"This was a great resort we stayed a few days! They had great fruit platters and the California omelet for healthy choices was great! There is a smoothie place in there food court area that has many healthy choices as well. Some good healthy choices here.  The rooms very nice! Room service way over priced! Save the money for slots and go down stairs to cafe and get same for much less.   The pool is nice and great for kids cause it has a sandy beach with the sand running into the pool like a beach!"}
{"text":"what happened??????  my wife and i went last friday night and the buffet food was hog swill.  the clam chowder was watery and over salted.  fried shrimp, cold.  salad bar was unattended and a lot of the selection was cross contaminated or empty.  orange chicken, cold as was most of the foods on the line.  we arrived at 4:30 and by 5 there was a line and there should be no excuse for cold greasy food.  i rather go the the dirty little hole in the wall known as terribles.  the service there is slow, prices reasonable and the food is always way above the green valley swill pit.  the next day we both had swollen hands and feet from the over salted food.  never, never again to that dump  bob"}
{"text":"I will never stay on the strip, again! The Green Valley Resort has convinced me that it is better to stay a safe distance from Vegas. You will enjoy making short and regular trips to the strip and then escape back to your calm and relaxing resort in Henderson. The property is so nice that you actually do not even need to go to the strip. They have a rather large casino that includes $5 blackjack, tons of slot machines, etc. They have restaurants, plenty of pools, beautiful landscaping, and a very nice gym. The attention to detail is fantastic. You feel like you are staying at a luxurious resort, but the price does not reflect that. They offer shuttle service to the strip, compliments of the resort. Give them a try and you will never stay elsewhere!"}
{"text":"GREAT locals hang out with a little bit of something for everyone from Drop Bar to Quinns to Ovation and more. The staff is extremely helpful and courteous. There's never a dull moment and hours of fun and enjoyment can be had. In my opinion this is one of the best hotel casino's in the Valley."}
{"text":"First off the servers by the pool had a very ugly attitude, they took forever to bring our food & drinks and was very sloppy about the whole thing. me & friends spent so much $$$$$$$ that wknd and treated us like crap. Secondly security harassed us the whole time about little things very hard to have fun. I think there names were Eddie & Emilio. Lookout for them"}
{"text":"Stay away!!!!! Horrible!, apparently they call this a luxury property???, while walking to our room we found our hallway smelled terrible!, like a dirty bathroom. We did our best to shake it off since we just arrived in Vegas and we were all excited.  So then when it came to sleep we found the mattress was  very uncomfortable and lumpy, my back was killing me after the second night. Then I went to the casino floor to play and have some drinks and found that if you want to just buy a cocktail it will run you $13 and it is a tiny 8 oz glass!, I couldn't believe they where charging strip prices for a smaller size!. A shot and a cocktail set me back $21!, that's ridicules for a place in Henderson!. The icing on the cake was on our last day at 8 am they where doing construction in the room above us!!!, I was woken up buy hammering and people talking very loudly!, No one should have to deal with loud construction at 8am in a hotel you are paying over $200 a night for. And when I talked to the front desk his reply was sorry I'll pass it on to my manager???!!!, are you kidding me??!!!. Never ever again will I stay here!, you should be embarrassed with your establishment GVR!, you are not luxury!, at all!."}
{"text":"Room: We were put in a room on the 3rd floor all the day at the end of the hallway facing the highway. I am pregnant and a light sleeper and that wasn't gonna suffice.  So I called the front desk where they told me my only other option was a 2 queen bed room, no more kings.  Hard to believe because the resort seemed deserted.  But we took it.  That was annoying.  Also, in both rooms we were in, the mini bar price list was completely out of date.  There were several items on both mini bars that were not even listed on the list.  I wanted these items but had no idea I would be bogusly charged for them so I didn't indulge.  Disappointing.  The powering washing each night of the pool area, VERY obnoxious.  Can this not be done after the pool closes when everyone is at dinner?  1. I could hear it from our room when we went to bed early. 2. The next night we went to the hot tub and they were power washing all around us and it was very obnoxious and loud.  Terrible.  Next, the steakhouse experience.  VERY disappointed in how that turned out.  Also, our last morning my husband went down to starbucks to get my an ice water.  He also ordered himself a coffee but he forgot his ID/wallet because he was just going to do a room charge.  We stayed at The Aria the 2 nights prior to coming here and didn't need our ID's for the room charges.  So we weren't used to it.  Well he didn't have his ID so he just asked them for the water for his pregnant wife and to forget the coffee.  They said no because the water was $.27, not free.  Are you kidding me?!  The resort can't spare $.27 as a courtesy to this EXTREME INCONVENIENCE after  a 10-15 minute round trip walk?  So he had to walk all the way back up to our room for his ID just to get me water.  He even asked if he could txt me and ask me to send a picture of his ID to show the cashier and he said no.  How absurd.  All for $.27 for the pregnant lady."}
{"text":"Green Valley Ranch is a couple of miles off the strip but let me tell you I LOVE THIS PLACE. The hotel/casino view from the freeway looks like your worn down huge old LAS VEGAS hotel but don't let the outside view decieve you, inside is a completely different story. The casino is not popular compare to the ones on the strip (mostly older folks playing slots) but the hotel section is lovely. We had the standard King size bedroom. I absolutely loved the bathroom- the setting was so elegant, and the bath tub was HUGE (yey for bubble baths). The best part about staying here is the SPA. They are known for there SPA which was newly renovated about year and a half ago. It is spacious and I don't know how to put it but everything seems to be \"up to date\". Furthermore please do not forget check out the \"Original Pancake House\" located in the casino area-they're awesome as well!"}
{"text":"My favorite Resort in Las Vegas!  They have the best spa in town. My house is less than 5 miles away from this hotel but I still cant get enough of this place. Ive stayed here a lot of times and loved it every time. Room is designed in a very classic and elegant way. The pool is also beautiful! The whole garden is just simply beautiful! From the pool, cabanas, the spa it's just spectacular! When you're here, you'll forget that you're in Vegas, its that beautiful! Service here is also great, people are nice and accomodating. You also have a lot of choices to choose from. Their cafe has also good food choices and its open 24/7!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite steak house!  Beef Ragou Striploin was excellent.  Martini was great as well.  Will be  back!"}
{"text":"I have stayed here twice now. My daughter does competitive dance and we are forced to stay here when she has her National Competition. Both visits have been horrendous. The first stay started with us arriving with two children at 11:00 PM after driving 5 hours to get there. It took over an hour to get help at the front desk. It turns out, the front desk Rep decided it was time for their break and just left without telling any customers in the long line. Once we got checked in, I went down to get our luggage to return to our room. This was after I carried both children, half asleep, to the other end of the hotel. When I walked back to request my luggage and a bellman, they told me no. I had to go back and call. I explained both my kids were asleep and that wouldn't work. I also explained I was suffering from a debilitating hernia that I was scheduled to have operated on the day I got back. They still didn't care and were really condescending. I told them fine and I would take it. I was not allowed to use their cart. I ended up carrying the luggage all the way across the hotel myself in severe pain. They laughed. The same service continued. My pain did not get better thge whole week.  I just went again for our competition. I went to check in, after waiting in a line for near an hour, and was told I could not. My wife booked the trip so I could not check in. My wife was backstage getting my girls ready to dance so she couldn't come. The front desk lady informed me very rudely \" well, maybe your wife should have thought about this ahead of time...very sarcastically\". My card was the one on the file. I asked her to call her cell, which she did. When she got off she looked at me and said, \"I don't like the way your wife talked to me. She should learn how to speak to people:. She then looked at me with a smile and said, \"You can check in after 5:00\". and laughed. I told her not to abuse her situation because she didn't like the way my wife spoke to her. I asked when we could actually check in and she told me to read the webpage. OK! I asked for a manager and after about ten minutes of them speaking out of my vision, the manager came out, chest puffed up, and glaring at me, ready to have a fight. She also told me to read the webpage. We finally got a call that our room was ready at 5:00...shocker! I called twice before arriving to confirm we would have 2 beds, due to health needs of my youngest. We got to our room and it was just a king. We called and asked to be moved and were told too bad, that is all they had. My wife then went to the front desk crying and asked for help and was rudely turned away. She had one agent tell her she should just go buy a bed at REI around the corner.   Clearly, this was their way to get back at my wife for apparently not knowing how to speak to people, which by the way, she is non-confrontational and I heard the conversation, which was not bad.   I heard multiple stories of this kind the whole week. It is clear that the organization stays understaffed to cut cost and therefore lacks proper personnel and competent staff.   There are too many other options in Las Vegas and surrounding areas for you to risk staying here. Find another option. We will be staying elsewhere, as will many others we spoke to, next year. It is not worth it. The Casino is weak and as I read on other posts, the slots are terribly tight. I agree.   On a bright note, if you can put up with incompetence and terrible service, the pool is great. You will not have very good service, but it is a lot of fun for adults and children. It is a shame that this place is such a mess. I chalked it up to an isolated incident last year, but it is clearly a trend. The employees are all miserable, except for the cleaning crew, who were the only employees to be helpful, smile, and engage. Maybe they should be promoted to more customer facing positions.  This place ruined two days of my hard earned vacation and I will not let it happen again. I encourage you to look elsewhere. My experience was echoed throughout the entire week. My intention is not to hurt GVR, but rather save any other families a big headache. Good luck."}
{"text":"Service at the bar near the sport booking area is terrible. Tried to get a drink and sit down to watch a game and bartender just looks at me and walks away. Tried to go to another bartender and no acknowledgment. Finally found a bartender but did not think it should be that hard. Service in this hotel seems to also been downgraded. GVR use to be a great establishment and was one of my favorite place to stay and gamble but will pass the next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We come here mostly for the restaurants and the District. Also the movie theater. The hotel rooms are lovely, up scale. We're local and do not care for the strip, so we enjoy Green Valley."}
{"text":"I went to eat the specials they have, and the person that gave us the service was very slow, we were waiting 1 hour without food, and there wasn't a lot of people because we were there on midnight"}
{"text":"Three Stars because the staff was incredibly nice - and - rooms are a nice size.    Experience:  2.5 stars  Room was not available until after check in time.  Had time to drop off bags and head out.  Hit the strip, had dinner, came back to resort and hung out in my friends' suite. Arrived in my room 12 hours later ...  4:15am.  Bed linens are dirty.  Staff came and replaced everything with sheets pillows comforter just recd from cleaning company.   Other minor things occurred but staff was  always pleasant; not sure if I would stay there again."}
{"text":"Great experience!  Especially at the pool . Happy and friendly Jenica made us feel that she was actually happy to serve us and that transferred to us and we had stellar service and a friendly attitude. Food was good and drinks great. Thank You !! Also beautiful hotel with great rooms. We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Worst experience,  never going back to there buffet.  I paid 18$ for my 2 year old... The cashier said no problem she's 2 We gave the host are receipt to seat us and said we had to pay for my daughter because she's 2 going on 3. She'll be 3 in a few months so she insisted!! We pay. We went back to the cashier told him the host said we have to pay for her even he! was shocked because she's 2!!! So we payd fine, we go to are table the host insist!!! To see the receipt showing we paid. She told the server \"make sure you check their receipt they have one more\"! Wow!  My daughter is 2... She ate a few slices of melon that's it, that's what I paid 18$ for.  That host was ridiculous !!"}
{"text":"My opinion may be a little biased considering I met my husband here, but I love the GVR! I used to live in Vegas right down the road from here and would visit frequently. The club they had(Whiskey Sky I believe it was called?) was amazing, the upstairs bar in the middle was also good and they have a movie theater. Not only that, but there is Fatburger as well as other restaurants and most of them are open 24 hours which is great when you've been drinking all night and need that perfect meal to end the night. The pancake house is sooooooooooo good too. I had the pleasure of staying here on my anniversary and the hotel surprised us with an entire PLATE of chocolate covered strawberries and champagne in our room free of charge. Everyone treated us like we were royalty which is the way you should feel on vacation. Apart from the rooms being absolutely decadent, the place had a small feel to it where the concierge and front desk would greet us by name. All in all, I left a very satisfied customer and would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Came here for a professional conference. It was ok. The Buffet was pretty standard vegas buffet food, but was well priced. The pool looked beautiful, but it was too cold to swim while we were here. The casino was pretty standard. The plates meal we got as part of the conference was really good.  The rooms were comfortable, but lacked a few things I usually expect from a nice hotel room, like a coffee pot or a shower that doesn't fill up with water while you are using it."}
{"text":"I stay here once or twice a year. Lots of food options, a great pool, both making it easy to entertain a kiddo. I also enjoy the shops. Customer service is great. They returned the Kindle that I left in my room in no time!"}
{"text":"I have stayed at GVR Resort about eight times in the last two years. I'm all over the board with the stars on this place. Decor and aesthetics get five stars from me. The rooms are tastefully appointed in a classic tuscany-style decor and the suites are GORGEOUS. The pool is as pretty or prettier than any I have seen in Las Vegas, but I must admit I have not seen them all yet! Service--with the exception of the likeable and helpful bell staff and shuttle drivers-gets just two. The casino gets three to four stars for decent play and game selection. The bartenders are a mixed bag. There is one daytime woman at the Drop bar I absolutely love, but others are downright negligent--playing music way too loud during off hours (Hey, Vegas is a 24-hour town. Be ready for customers any time!) On a recent visit, RAW had to yell at a man the female bartender was sitting next to at a video poker machine because he yelled expletives regarding his gambling losses. He appeared to possibly be an off-duty worker of some sort, but when RAW asked if he worked there, the bartender sheepishly said no, that he was I customer. I don't know. She proceeded to fill my coffee past the meniscus so I had no choice but to burn myself when I picked it up. One time, though, a real sweetheart of a bartender offered to take me to dinner at Hank's-a gorgeous, gorgeous steakhouse I have yet to try  (I declined) and then proceeded to buy me a burger from the cafe and bring it to me because it was my birthday and I was crying in my champagne because RAW and I had had an argument. Boo hoo. Warning: GVR is uber-expensive. Expensive can be okay if things are a good value for the money, but if I were to actually pay the rack rate for a room here (sometimes $350) I would expect to have my you-know-what kissed a lot more than it does when I use my comps. It is as if the staff isn't...ummm...informed. From the concierge--who begged ignorance when I asked for the exact name of the movie theatre to the Keno staff who did not know if I could view the Keno numbers from my room to a casino manager who suggested I get up from my slot machine and make a phonecall when I asked as he walked by, if I could use my comps at the food court. GVR is a good staycation though, with a movie theater and the shops and restaurants at The District, Pizza Rock, a Bingo parlor, the fabulous pool, a top-notch food court and gorgeous beyond gorgeous grounds. With a little staff training, a slightly better value for your buck, and a wee bit more consistency in the appointment of the rooms (some are markedly better than others in the same category), GVR could easily garner four or even five stars. A great place with sometimes shoddy service."}
{"text":"Great location and great staff! Really enjoyed our stay here and will book at this property again for our future visits to the 702!"}
{"text":"Stations Casinos are the best for locals and tourists!!! The pools are awesome and the staff is always right on point. Hanks, Pizza Rock all yum scrum! It's a toss up between GVR and Red Rock. Thanks Sartinis for these fine establishments!"}
{"text":"I was eating dinner last week and had such a great experience.  The ambiance was a great setting with beautiful decor. My server Erik, was great. Awesome smile and assertive. Diego, came by suggested some wine for me and my friends.  Out celebrating a birthday. He told some jokes, gave us a recommendation on a couple dive bar's. My friend told me she had such a great time. Thank you Hanks!!!"}
{"text":"GVR is a nice place to stay. I will stay there again.  I would warn again upgrading your room to a suite though.  It's definitely not worth the cost.  We were offered an upgrade with a balcony. We were told we would have views of The Strip and views of the pool.  We decided to upgrade.  The room was nice, but it was not all that much better than their regular room.  The balcony was very nice.  The balcony had a 4-person table and chairs set, and two very comfy lounge chairs.  This was nice.  However, there was absolutely no view of The Strip or the pool.  The balcony suites are on the first floor!!!!! How could the check-in girl not know this? I don't know.  We were definitely disappointed that there was no view."}
{"text":"I have never stayed at the hotel so this review in only about the casino and spa.  This is my favorite casino to play slots mainly cause I have done so well.  I also love the spa and massage facility."}
{"text":"Gorgeous property!  Spa pool area is very posh.  The steam room, sauna  and spas are great too.   Facial was superb.  It was up there with spas I've visited in Kaanapali and Sonoma!  Body wrap was so-so; definitely wouldn't do it there again.  The guy was really sloppy and got mud in my hair.  He was also really rushed and it just wasn't relaxing.  It was nothing close to other wraps I've had in the past.   It is nice that the gratuity is included in the price of the service, but, it's  still pretty expensive!  Staff was really in need of some training!  I had to ask a janitor how to get to the Women's locker room because the person that gave me the key pointed behind me then disappeared.  Once I got in the locker room I had to ask another customer where the restroom was because there wasn't an attendant to ask.  When I did run into the attendant 1/2 way through my visit she was great!  Very nice and helpful and offered to order me food if I wanted any.  After a long day of R & R , I was super hungry.  I couldn't find the attendant, so, asked another spa staffer if I could get food delivered, but, they couldn't find a menu so they sent me out to the pool.  I waited about 15 minutes for the waitress and tried feverishly to flag her down, but, she wasn't having it.  Another 10 minutes pass and she dropped drinks off to the people right next to me and I smiled and asked if I could get a few things.  She told me someone else would be along soon because her shift was over.  Another 10 minutes passed and the person I originally asked for a menu that couldn't find one was in the area and asked me if I ever found the waitress.  I told him no, so he found someone to come help.  55 minutes later I finally got my salad and mojito, which were pretty good.  Was it 5 star? No, but there is potential.  Maybe I got all of the staff on a bad day?"}
{"text":"This place was great, the resort fee is for the use of the spa and is so worth it, my wife and I went every day. The rooms are big and really comfortable. I will stay there again!!"}
{"text":"We live in town, but wanted a 'beach' getaway with our 2 year old. First day went great.. hotel is beautiful, and our room was clean and gorgeous. the second morning we were ready to use the beach/pool, when we were notified that the main pool is closed for the day due to an \"incident\". It was 102F that day and we had a 2 year old desperate to go build sand castles.. After about an hour speaking with management and concierge, they 'rectified' the situation by offering us movie tickets ... because our 2 year old is going to sit through a 2 hour movie (yeah right... and they had no childrens movies showing)... Aside from the pool incident (which is the sole reason we came here), everything would have been fine... just not a very small kid friendly place as they advertise. I am very disappointed how the pool situation was handled by management. Otherwise I would have rated 5 stars.."}
{"text":"Of all the local casino hotels in las vegas, I like GVR the most. Their buffet is very good including their malted shakes & the Ovation Room is a great place to see live entertainment."}
{"text":"This is a nice hotel, but not necessarily one of my favorites.  I stayed here because they host a ballroom competition.  I think the rooms in the West Tower are nicer than the ones in the East Tower.  I preferred the color scheme and decor in the West Tower (browns and blues and more contemporary) over the decor in the East Tower (yellows, browns, drabby colors and very ornately Italian/Mediterranean).  The rooms were nice and big.  I like that the hotel itself isn't too big, so it doesn't take forever to walk from different areas.  Also, it wasn't overly smoky which was nice.  But maybe that's because it wasn't very crowded.  Tthere are movie theaters in the hotel and shopping (The District) within walking distance.  I ate at the buffet every day that I stayed there because I got a room deal that included free buffet and movie tickets.  I'll be back next year, but mainly for the ballroom competition."}
{"text":"I've stayed here twice for work, and GVR is a fine property, but just seems a little dated and drab, and both times I've stayed, I've noticed some \"off\" things in the rooms (I stayed in a really nice suite one of the times and the steam shower was broken, one of the phones didn't work, and the remote on the living area TV needed new batteries.  In the regular room, I was missing shampoo in the shower, and one of the dresser handles kept falling off). The hotel only has 7 stories, and a lot of rooms have views of the parking garage, which is sort of a bummer.    The pool area is really nice, there's a sandy area that's good for kids, and a secluded 21+ area for adults, as well as a quiet lap pool by the spa.  They play great music by the pool too - lots of stuff that made me go \"I remember that song from high school!.\"  it was fun.   The bikini-clad waitresses are a bit much for my taste, but it's nice to have good drinks and snacks served poolside, and there's lots of good people watching.  There's also a huge spa/workout area that looked cool.  The hotel is near the District, which is a great open area pedestrian mall that makes you feel a million miles from Vegas (check out Rachel's for a great breakfast, and do some shopping at Anthropologie or REI and watch all the young families and puppies walking around).  There's also a movie theater on site - so plenty to do if you're not into gambling.  Plenty of slot machines and other gambling options if you are into that, including at least one $5 blackjack table for cheapskates like me.  And there's a great Irish pub near the casino with $3 pints, which was nice.    Someone else mentioned the lack of coffee makers.  Agreed, that they were missed.  we had a big work meeting here, and our meeting planners brought this up with the hotel - we learned that it's a health/safety concern.  Those coffee pots were full of germs.  Keurig machines would be a nice option because the alternative to trekking downstairs is ordering a $15 pot of coffee via room service."}
{"text":"I loved staying here! The place is beautiful! Our room was very nice and spacious. The pool area has lots of seating and shade. We enjoyed the spa and sauna and the showers after working out in the gym. Lots of restaurants to choose from and lots of specials at different times throughout the day. I will go back anytime!"}
{"text":"Went today and was very disappointed by the way we were treated! Our friends had reserved a daybed. The reservations were not transferred from the concierge to the pool desk and they told us there was no day bed. My one year old grew impatient with how hot it was, and they told us we had to stand to the side of the pool in the heat while it was sorted out. Once the concierge finally found the reservation, she was incredibly rude and had an attitude. Let's just say I will NOT be returning to their pool..."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch. Nothing special on the lower end of Las Vegas buffets.  The chicken and nachos were all I liked. My wife tried several pastas and none satisfied her. The up side was it was cheap and the selection was decent. Just seems to need some revamping to increase food quality. The wait was also longer than expected for a place off the strip."}
{"text":"Much nicer hotel than the price would indicate...definitely recommend it if you are going to stay off the strip.  The staff in the hotel, spa and casino were all incredibly helplful."}
{"text":"Went there to go to the movies, parking structure to the elevator, elevator has no a/c. Okkkkaaayyyy, walking down to movie theatre everything good. Go into theatre and very sticky and humid inside, sat down and seats squeak when your leaning back, not just mine, everybodys, then when the movie starts ( we seen Lucy by the way ) the suround  sound speaker was blown making a crackling sound . I don't know if this is a GVR isssue or a Reagle issue but if your going to compete with Brendan or century this is the little things that will not bring people back."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, I took friends for a celebratory dinner.  The tab for 3 of us was $450 with 4 glasses of Champaign and two glasses of wine.  We had a very attentive staff of 5 waiting on us, I don't think we had to ask for anything, they were so attentive that refills simply came without noticing... the food was excellent!!!  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I stayed here with 2 girlfriends for a nice, relaxing Las Vegas vacation. We chose the hotel because we had heard and read many good things about it despite it being far from the strip.  The hotel is beautiful and very clean; however, that is were the good things end. The front desk is unhelpful and very rude. We booked a room with two beds and even called prior to coming to confirm that our room would have two beds. When we arrived, we were told that our room wasn't quite ready (despite it being 15 mins after check in time). We hung out in the casino until an hour and half past check in time. At that point, we still hadn't received a call from the front desk as promised. When we went back up to the front desk we were told that our room was and had been ready. Upon getting to our room, we only had 1 bed and called the front desk to see about getting switched. The front desk manager Donna was horribly rude-- didnt apologize for the inconvenience and simply replied that they can never guarantee two beds. I am completely baffled that a hotel can't guarantee two beds and even more so that no apology was given. They brought up a roll away free of charge and switched us rooms the next day.  Many times and with many other hotel guests the room keys wouldn't work on the door to get to the east tower.  When calling to ask about the shuttle pick up site, we were given the wrong directions. We found an employee on the casino floor who gave us the right directions but both failed to explain you have to get a shuttle boarding pass (the website says you only must have your room key).  The pool seemed to be overfilled but otherwise was a nice place to hang out during the day.  The buffet was great and even rivaled the buffet at the bellagio. However the cashier johntel was so slow and rude in processing the orders and allowing a group of 5 people cut in front of the line. There seems to be a serious lack of management throughout the hotel.  We constantly got the feeling that we would have received better service if we were locals. I understand and appreciate taking care of locals but it should not come at the expense of the other guests.  The valet attendants were all very nice, knowledgeable and helpful. Maybe the other employees' bad attitudes haven't rubbed off on them yet.  Overall, I would not come here again and definitely would not recommend to anyone who's not a local."}
{"text":"Great casino and hotel! Fun games, great atmosphere and the rooms are AMAZING! Beautiful views, awesome pool and comfortable bed! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"this was my fav. buffet spot in vegas.  we always ask the cook to saute shrimp and crab loaded w/ garlic and spices... we called it \"the works\"!  it was delish!  however, on my last visit... they were no longer serving crab  and only served the shrimp during dinner (they used to serve shrimp and crab lunch & dinner).  so my mission now is to find a new buffet spot that will provide \"the works\"!"}
{"text":"I have stayed tons of times in Vegas on Las Vegas blvd to Fremont street to over other side to here. This place is beautiful and quiet I love it. I only stayed at the hotel didn't walk around see casino nothing but room was beautiful. We stayed in the east tower which is quite a walk for a two year old. Besides paying $200.00 for one night that was little insane but everyone else was same price for a Saturday. But overall will be back I loved it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had an opportunity to eat at the breakfast buffet on feb 28th, there is not much to say except, It was horrible.. The food was unbelievably bad, and tasteless.. Eggs Benedict should at the least have a sauce that can be identified.. This one was pale yellow, yet there was no taste to it at all, lemon was completely absent.. I have no idea what it was made from, but it certainly was not lemon or eggs.. While most things can be explained for bad food, stupidity is not an excuse.. The section that was serving the fresh bowls of fruits, water melon, cantaloupe, and pineapple sitting in large stainless steel bowls, packed in ice, had the HEAT LAMPS on.?. Actually had to tell them that they were ON.. Needless to say the fruit was hot on top and cold on the bottom.  This was my last trip to the 'green valley ranch' anything.."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hotels ever but when I stayed there in Jan it was one nightmare after another for example no one said the entire main pool was being dug up. I also got grabbed at by a drunk male guest, had charges that weren't mine on my room etc etc. spa staff v kind but apparently spa is not part of hotel anymore?? Sad bc I've had great stays there w the fam including a fantastic upgrade on my kid's 21st bday. I think we got the Geneva suite. It has a jacuzzi tub in one bar plus steam shower in another plus guest bath plus pool table and room for a party of 30 or more"}
{"text":"I have to say my husband and I have always enjoyed coming to GVR to gamble. Unfortunately after are last two experience in the high limit room, we will no longer come to the property due to a rude and out of line dealer named Gail. Not only is she raciest and highly out of line asking me my occupation was after saying we should move to another table. She even went a step further slandered myself about my weight and making comments about the other two players we were with. We spend a substantial amount of money, but will no longer while she is working in the room. Players be wear...."}
{"text":"Decent casino. We went to the buffet. It was mediocre at best. Salad bar was basic. Good fruit and dressing. Dessert tasteless. Good fish. Better than Golden Corral and costs half as much as buffets on strip. Should have gone to Cheesecake factory by resort instead. Free parking."}
{"text":"OK, we all know that Green Valley is the best casino in Henderson!  No question about that - I think that it is almost a 5 star (our ratings here) but I have to reserve that rating for Bellagio and Wynn.  When I am in a casino, I am in Green Valley Ranch Casino...its very nice and the FOOD in ALL the restaurants is just so good.  You can never go wrong having dinner in the casino - ever!  Go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Wow! What can I say, this is the place to go in Vegas if you are looking for some rest and relaxation away from the Strip, but not too far away where you can easily get to the strip when you want to go.. They have the top rated Spa in all of Las Vegas, the nicest cleanest rooms with doorbells on them even and do not disturb button or please clean room bottom that you can just push when you need one of those things. I would highly recommend using your players club card so you can get the casino rate or even a complimentary room... The staff is super nice and friendly and take care of all your needs. They have several bars there, one near the pool and has some neat couches that you could sit on with silk covering them or you can relax outside by the pool with your drink.. They also have the district where you can go shopping conveniently located next door and many fast food restaurants where you can eat or high end or other restaurants priced in the middle.. I have been there many times and have never been disappointed!!"}
{"text":"My family and I stay here every weekend and enjoy the pool ! The rooms are always clean and the workers are amazing ! It is always a good time here !"}
{"text":"We are locals who usually stay at Sunset Station but I wanted to try this one for once..2 words MINI BAR if you have kids make sure you lock this stuff up or otherwise you will have a few hundred $$$$ bill really fast.as candy bars are 6 bucks EACH, We ate at the buffet the only saving grace was when we were almost done they brought the shrimp and ribs out plus this buffet has on the dessert bar you can get mini milk shakes with your choice of the ice cream they serve in scoops. Did not find the ice machine til the next morning while walking out to leave. Parking garage was easy access from our room through the food couurt. Food court has multiple choices my fav the Coffee Bean and tea leaf...No starbucks."}
{"text":"Just completed a stay at GVR. The hotel room was first rate. The Casino is beautiful with all of the gambling games plus a big Sports Book. Hanks Fine Steaks and Martinis was one of the best restaurant experiences we've had. From 4-7 they have happy hour with 1/2 price martinis. Ask Phil the bartender to do his trick pouring multiple martinis at once. He did six at once. It was phenomenal. The food was as good as any steak house food I've ever had. Now the bad news. Forget about eating breakfast at the Grand Cafe.  It is awful with the food bordering on uneatable. The food was delivered lukewarm bordering on cold. My overall four star rating is because of the Grand Cafe. Otherwise everything is 5 star at GVR."}
{"text":"We love this casino and its kid friendly!  they have the kidsquest for the boys to hang out when mom and dad want to be alone.  The restaurants are all good...even a food court.  We love the sand bottom pool and enjoy it all summer.  The outside shopping called the District is very nice as well"}
{"text":"I'm also a station casino team member and they gave us all free passes to the green valley ranch pool, I came with my husband and daughter and we had a great time. It is so relaxing its perfect for kids but u might enjoy yourself more if u come with just your adult friends so u can have some drinks and hit the jacuzzi. Great great pool and environment"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Gracious service,  very clean, not smoky like so many Vegas casinos. Food is excellent. Reasonable rates and big room. I'll go back."}
{"text":"This is the best resort I have ever been to in my life. When we first pulled into the property I was speechless. It is just beautiful at night! With all Tue palm trees and lights,  the view was amazing. The doormen was super friendly and one in particular gave us a lot of tips that we found very handy for first time visitors. Check in was very quick and painless,  we was escorted to our room and very pleased I must say! Walked in to a clean and spacious room, bathroom was huge and beautiful as well. We went to walk around and the casino is HUGE! Lots of restaurants and even a movie theater at the lower level.  The next day I was awaken by what sounded like someone trying to drill there way into my room lol. I called the front desk and they moved us up to the top floor,  only thing I expected for the inconvenience was maybe a upgrade but hey whatever! The rest of the stay was very enjoyable and all of the staff was very friendly! Great place to stay! Ooh the spa area is a must visit! Very peaceful and serene!"}
{"text":"STAAAAYYY HEEERRE!!!!!!!  Beautiful property!!! I stayed in the \"cheap rooms\" being the one on the ground floor with a view of the parking garage... haha... The room was really nice though... Very spacious bad room, and the bathroom was as nice as some of the \"deluxe suite\" bathrooms I have seen in other hotels... Pretty descent casino floor... LOTS of slots and a good amount of tables... looked like a nice poker room when i walked by, same as the high stakes room... Ate at most of the restaurants inside, and they were all top notch... and fatburger is so tasty at 5 am stumbling back to your room after a hard day and then hard night of drinking :D  PROS:      *Everything (haha)      * Excellent staff      * Very comfortable rooms (bathrooms are gorgeous)      * Reasonable room rates (stayed Sunday - Wednesday at 90$ a night)      * Day Spa service is included in room rate... nice...      * Pools are amazing (both euro style (topless / salt water) and traditional pool - sandy beach included)      * Grounds are very well groomed (they have their own vineyard!! we ate some fresh grapes right off the vine)      * Surprisingly there were a lot of families staying there... nice to get to Vegas without the XXX shoved in your face all the time   CONS:      * $25-$30 cab ride to the strip (shuttles are offered, but don't run too frequently)      * XXX isn't shoved in your face all the time ;)  I don't think I will go back to Las Vegas and NOT stay here... it's worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Locals recommended we stay at Green Valley Ranch (GVR) Resort & Spa recently. I tried the GVR web site, which indicated that every room we inquired about was full for the night we wanted to stay. Okay, try the 866 number on their web site. The GVR phone receptionist, Gustavo, put me through to reservations. I sat on hold listening to Muzak for 15 minutes. Then I was hung up on with the wailing \"hang up noise\" blaaaah blaaaah blaaaah blaaaah blaaaah tone on the phone.  Bummer, becauseI heard they had some nice swimming pools, and I'm a swimmer so I was looking forward to staying there. After others read this review, several Las Vegas-ites informed me that I was a \"fool\" for waiting on hold for so long and a \"crybaby\" for being unhappy with being hung up on. I was informed that I should basically just get used to it, as that's how it is in good ol' Las Vegas, and I just should have called back instead of \"whining\" (all words in quotes are \"their words\"). Okay, I got it now. Thanks for the helpful information from those locals who contacted me."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the best finds I have found in Las Vegas, and it's not on the strip! YAY! Located just south in Henderson right off HWY 215, this is such a beautiful facility.  The staff here also has the utmost value in customer service - I never experienced anywhere else in Vegas, the CS that they demonstrate here.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was a great stay. The hotel was very classy and gave you the Vegas experience without being in the strip.   The bingo room was super clean and the staff was AWESOME. They were friendly and helpful and humorous!   The room was very clean and it was even the one near the elevator, but we never even noticed.   The one downside I did have to say is it is a little bit of a confusing floor plan, and there is a lot of walking if someone isn't able to walk far etc. But, i'm pretty sure they have wheelchairs etc. available.   Ate at their restaurant with a coffee shop attached. It was good, but nothing to rave about there.   Thanks for the great stay!"}
{"text":"Had my wedding Reception here on August 16th. LET ME FIRST START OFF BY SAYING THE ONLY REASON I GAVE THIS ESTABLISHMENT 2 STARS IS BECAUSE OF MRS PENNY FUSSELL (BANQUET EVENTS COORDINATOR) OTHER THAN THAT IF I COULD GIVE NEGATIVES I WOULD HAVE.   My Wedding Reception took place in the la cascada banquet room  . The banquet crew kept several of my decor items. Which were later mailed back to me after raising awareness of the miss items to Mrs. Fussell  Several Items that me and my husband prepaid for through the banquet ( Very Expensive) were discarded by banquet crew without awareness.   Very disappointed with this action. Working Class doesn't have money to throw away I would have appreciated if a member of the team came up to us prior to discarding our items and asked if we like them boxed.  This didn't happen. I raised awareness to Mrs. Fussell (listed above) She was very apologetic and said that she can only due what the banquet director allowed and at this point the director was not willing to compensate or replace the discarded items.  Poor Customer Service and Bad Business on the Director End. For this establishment to call itself a four star resort your business ethnics are horrible to hassle your customer over  compensation of nearly $300 dollars worth of prepaid items. Will Take my business to a competitor Next Time.   I will continue to reflect my complaints with other entities such as Forbes magazine and Better Business Bureau"}
{"text":"Great  casino and pool. Oscar was very helpful at the pool. I can't wait to go back thank you. I also appreciated the lady in the cafe who helped me find the elevators."}
{"text":"Purchased travelzoo vouchers for Friday Saturday stay @ $100/night. Each attempt at reserving..Friday available but not Saturday and visa versa.  Green valley directed me to travelzoo, had no interest in trying to accommodate me.  Travelzoo is impossible to deal with.  Don't offer a promotion if you can't fulfill your offer.  Won't ever deal with travelzoo nor green valley ranch."}
{"text":"Green Valley Resort Casino is a pretty awesome place for us Henderson locals. I come in here with friends or family to hit Pizza Rock. I am not a big gambler, so cannot give an opinion with that.    This is one of the newer resort casinos in the Valley with an updated casual feel. It is comfortable, clean and has a great vibe. You can come in with casual wear as it is not stuffie... It's comfie! GVR is adjacent to The District, which is full of great shops and other restaurants. It is easily reached off the 215 fwy and has a lot of parking. If you cannot find parking in the front, remember there is a multi-level parking structure in the back.  I've been here for 4th of July a couple times and it's a great place to watch fireworks. There is also a movie theatre down stairs, so if you are in for a pizza and movie...GVR is the place!"}
{"text":"I love GVR, it's definitely my go to casino when I want to go out. As a local it's hard to find places to go that seem local but aren't run down. GVR is beautiful,  sparing no expense. Every time my family comes to town it's the first place I want to take them. I love it!"}
{"text":"I would have given this hotel 5 stars and a huge thumbs up if it weren't for the bizarre arrogance of the valet staff. I stayed here yesterday and to get yelled at by a valet for simply asking him to get the keys to your car is unacceptable. This morning, same ass hole attitude. At one point, I asked one of the ass hole valets if this in fact, \"a five star hotel?\" Maybe the hotel itself is five star, but literally once you step outside its like a bunch a of D-student frat guys in their mid-late 30's parking cars."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch buffet. The buffet was just ok, nothing really special from other buffets i've tasted, though i was surprised that i didn't pay as much as other buffets in Vegas. I played for 5 min at the crazy horse penny slots and won about $150. Cool."}
{"text":"This place  has a cozy and calm ambiance. It is far from the strip and that its not that busy compared to other casinos. They have a small outdoor mall beside it. They have a cinema the hotel and casino. They have a food court,buffet and bars. This place is where you should go if you want to relax but still want to have the thrill of playing in the casinos ans betting on games."}
{"text":"Esthetically the outside of the building and the pool area are both very pleasing to the eye, but don't be easily impressed if you are looking for a good nights sleep. The beds are old, noisy and uncomfortable, and the roll out beds belong in the trash. I had springs digging into my back, tossing and turning all night, only to wake up to a sore back. And when shared with the staff they could care less, their solution was just to add more blankets and pillows. Very disappointing! And a crappy vacation because of it. : ("}
{"text":"I love this place and want to give it 5 stars but I can't. I checked out leaving my buckwheat pillow in the room and reported the loss within 24 hours. The pillow was never found. I left it in the room. How hard could it be to find? I made several calls to the hotel expressing my desire to get it back and either no one made an effort or there isn't an established and effective Lost and Found Program. For this reason I can only give it two stars.  GVR has all the elements of a satisfying resort capable of accommodating a wide range of guests.  I know it' s my fault for leaving the  pillow in the room, however traveling is a partnership between the hotel and guest and in this the hotel didn't even show up.  This is the 2nd year in a row my conference of 30 met at the GVR. It's still undecided what next year will bring."}
{"text":"Great hotel.  I love that you don't have to walk through a casino.  Great pool area.  Big bonus - getting a massage from Penny!  Ask for her at the spa or some nights you'll find her giving the best 10 minute back massage in the casino while you gamble.  You can't beat that!  I would come back to this hotel / casino just for that experience."}
{"text":"We hosted a wedding reception at Green Valley Ranch in April of 2016.   Overall we were very happy with the outcome. Our representative, Valerie, worked very hard to make sure everything went off without a hitch and their staff were kind, polite and professional. It was clear they really valued our business. They even made a fantastic wedding cake from a photo we found on the internet.   We Selected GVR based on the venue (it was a nice new location, not run down), service and price (we liked how the event was priced and was great value for the money compared to other offers at other venues)  The only hitch we hit was early on. Our contact at GVR coordinating the event left the company rather suddenly. As a result, there was a few days of disarray. Thankfully, our new contact Valerie, quickly got up to speed and made sure everything went smoothly!  Our friends and family commented on how nice our reception was and we are very happy with how it went. We would definitely do another event at GVR!"}
{"text":"Love going here with my family. Local casino driving distance from us and away from all the crazy obnoxious tourists. They have a great Pizza restaurant inside as well as a decent priced buffet. The pool area is really nice."}
{"text":"I had such a great experience and would totally go back. Every employee was extremely helpful and made sure I was comfortable and able to relax. Deffinitly recommended! :) Best Service ever!! And the massage was amazing!"}
{"text":"Drew is simply the best.  Two Chairmen events in one week started a bit hectic for the 4th of July, but he made it all flow smoothly.  We were told incorrect information by the GVR operator, two ladies at the right place and a woman who answered the VIP services line.  By this time I was irritated.  Drew stepped up & it was a quick fix.  Customer service, common sense (that I felt know one had at the time) & courtesy.  All things that I wish everyone had!  Picked up our tickets for Sinbad across from the Grand Cafe is where all of the 'will call' takes place.  Drew was once again there & w/ no issues, quickly found our name & provided the tickets.  Amen.    For President or Chairmen, you get two free tickets or it's a great deal, $25 so I decided to take my friend for his bday & my parents.  We enjoyed a delicious dinner at Bottiglia & the staff there is above & beyond in all ways.  They made the night.  Then, we headed to the Grand Events Center (which has a separate Yelp) to the show & they had app's from each restaurant down there!  Awesome to know even tho we were full.  The show was hilarious & I left with sore cheeks & an ab muscles from laughing so hard.    I have to say that when my family is happy, I am & thank you Drew & GVR for that this week."}
{"text":"Best spa experience here and pool service is amazing and also in reservations! Hands down then best spa staff everrrrr and u will get the best massage everrrrr"}
{"text":"False advertising -   I have been here multiple times - each time for hours and hours and hundreds of dollars played - you will be lucky if you hit a wild royal. How they can advertise this is beyond me. Machines so tight and no play.    Every time I play here I'm disappointed. I'm calling them out on this BS. 5 machines in a row and not one winner in a 4 hour period.   I understand I can go elsewhere to play, but wanted to leave my review (which is not a typical review) that each establishment is responsible for their advertising. This is false advertising."}
{"text":"The Good... 1. GORGEOUS hotel, pools and rooms! 2. We stayed for free with casino offer 3.  Our room requests were honored 4. Everyone was friendly and helpful 5. Original Pancake House 6. Coffee maker in the room  The Bad 1. Shower was very small  2. It was confusing to find the actual hotel 3. There was only one valet guy working most of the time we were there 4. Machines were tight (or at least we didn't win here)  Tim loved this place and I thought it was okay.  We would stay again if we were trying to have a few relaxing days while in Vegas."}
{"text":"While my room was spacious, comfortable, and smell free,  and the meeting facility was great for what our company wanted to accomplish, the smokiness of the hotel's common areas was just too much. Whenever we walked through our security door from the East Tower into the main hall, the smell was overpowering. The casino air was almost blue. And the Lobby Bar wasn't much better with ashtrays and smokers everywhere. I'm not used to staying somewhere that smoking is still allowed. In MN, it's verboten everywhere. I found the GVR experience. off-putting at best."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our stay. Staff was great, room was clean. Wifi a little quirky. Spa and gym were outstanding."}
{"text":"UPDATE: The hotel authorized $100 for incidentals, but instead of the authorization pending and just falling off, it went through as a charge. The hotel had to refund me which took days to post. Then they accidently refunded my debit card $27.00 instead of my boyfriend's card. So to even it out, the manager refunded my boyfriend's card, but then charged my card. This was fine because the refund and charge on my card would have just evened out. Well come to find out that there was no refund on my card, just the charge. So I basically gave my boyfriend a refund. Now I have to dispute this charge and wait around some more. This is insane! I will NEVER ever stay here again. I've never had so many problems before."}
{"text":"I stayed here for a friends wedding.   My room was re-keyed multiple times; I spent more than an hour locked-out in total. The pool has practically zero service, so everyone had to go to the bar. The restaurants are just straight mediocre, food & service is all meh. Casino is super-smokey which I only walked through to go to bad restaurants. I have zero plans to return."}
{"text":"Got a comp room as a local player. This has to be the most turned around backwards hotel I have ever been in. I demanded to stay on the ground floor because I don't think I could find my way out in case of a fire!! Woke up this morning to the maid pounding on the door at 9:30 am. (There wasn't a Do Not Disturb Sign to put out). Housekeeper  pounded on the door AGAIN 30 minutes later. It is Labor Day for Christ Sakes! We just asked her 30 min earlier to please let us sleep. Beautiful room but strangely no coffee maker. I'm not going to say how much I spent at the steak house, slots or BINGO,I need my coffee!! Can you hear me housekeeper? Take away from this posting; no such thing as a free room!"}
{"text":"After staying on the Strip for a few days, we booked this resort to relax and get away from all the partying for a couple days.    We were immediately greeted by the friendly valet & check in was a breeze.  We were a couple hours early but it was not a problem.  The staff was very professional, helpful, friendly and conversational.  It was somewhat of a trek to our room but once there it was clean, nicely decorated and the bathroom was awesome.  It had a separate tub & shower.    The pool area was clean and had sand on the shallow part.  It could have been slightly larger but does the job.  There are also private Cabanas that you can rent with a semi private pool - 3ft deep but very long, long enough to do some laps.  Our Cabana was furnished with a flat screen television with inputs for video games, a sound system (same music playing as other Cabanas, you can control the sound).  A safe, a mini fridge, a couple love seats and a coffee table.  There is an attendant that checks up on you if you require any libations (add'l cost), the fridge is fully stocked with an assortment of sodas, sobe drinks, red bull, water, etc.  Last there is a large bowl of assorted fruits brought out about noon time.    The gym and spa are located adjacent to the pool area.  We utilized the gym but not the spa.  Friendly staff, the fitness center has free weights, cardio equipment and a variety of machines to work out every part of your body.  Dining- the \"Feast Buffet\" very well priced and a nice selection.  Many other options, from fine dining to a food court.    Close to shopping and movie theatre.  Overall a nice well maintained property.  They charge a $25 +tax daily resort fee and on top of that,  a $100 day deposit.  That's the only thing I hate about this place.  Other than that, we'll certainly return.  (check out valet was awesome!  VERY, VERY helpful!  I believe his name was Jeff)"}
{"text":"I had a piece of jewelry rip off by the maid, it was hidden in my personal items. Went to hotel security and was blown off by them. Hotel manager was nice, but in the end I received a letter from the hotel stating they were not responsible for any items in the rooms ! So if your I- Pad, iPod  , cell phone , expensive handbags or shoes end up missing, don't expect to be reimbursed ! If its not in their tiny safe, you just gave the maid a huge tip! She can clean you out and remain blameless. To bad I really like this resort , I was a return customer of 6 stays :("}
{"text":"Wow.  I have never been treated so poorly as a frequent business traveler. Two of my colleagues and I arrived at GVR at 7pm PST, after a 5 hour flight to be told they could not honor our reservations because the had a big group and no rooms for us.   The hotel manager was summoned when we tried to check in and told us we were being sent to their \"sister\" hotel. We had no other options except maybe the rental car -there were 5 conventions in Vegas on this week.  I have a platinum status with one of the major chains and could not find a room at any of their hotels.  The manager and his boss claim they tried to call us (while on the plane). I find that a little odd given there was no message on my cell phone nor on my work voicemail. If I wanted to cancel with the Green Valley I have to give them THREE DAYS NOTICE not to be charged. Very deceptive and unethical. Nothing of value was offered to compensate what we experienced given we traveling on business and had no personal expense. Initially, we thought we were only being sent to another hotel for the first night of our stay. When we learned we were not staying at the GVR period, the dinner that we were offered was less appealing since we would have to drive back to a place where we were treated like second-class citizens  The rooms at the other property were comped but no way I would have spent a dime of my or my companies money there.  Check one of the travel websites for the difference in room rates at the Green Valley Ranch versus the Sunset Station and you will understand the difference in the level of these properties.  I have stayed at the GVR many times because it is convenient for my business purposes.  I had reservations to return in February.  They sent us to a hotel that did have a renovated room but no safety latches for the door.  Their lobby was smoky and the hall to the elevator smelled of vomit.  This was in now way an equal level hotel.  Locals In our meeting  heard about what happened and said they would never stay where we were sent nor eat there.   I could go on and on.  I, nor any of my team, will ever go to GVR again. We have cancelled all future reservation. This is a place that doesn't care about their individual repeat clients or at least that was how we were treated.  Low class treatment to a repeat customer, I would never trust they would not do this again. Beware!"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for the weekend to attend a friend's baby shower when we stayed at Green Valley. We had a minor hiccup at check in but the bell lady was very nice and apologetic. After that our experience with the staff was very pleasant.   Our room was a double queen bed with a suite-like bathroom. I liked the glass shower and that the toilet had its own door in the bathroom.   Everything was pleasant until I came poolside and encountered the staff that is a bunch of nonchalant, lazy twenty somethings who act like they're doing you a favor. One staff member saw me struggling with the umbrella but didn't come over until I asked. The two waitresses were only interested in attending to big parties. We waited 20 minutes and neither of them came over to ask us if we wanted anything. I finally walked over to the bar and mentioned it to her, and despite her apology she never did come over to our area. We're already over paying for the drinks and food so at the very least they could have been attentive to everyone that was poolside."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local casino. Perks for locals for food, drinks, and gaming. During football season Stations Casino has a free weekly football contest. I have won drinks, free slot play and points for dining. Sunday and Monday during football season has drinks and food special at the sport book bar. Go place to watch games with friends. There are many places dine, from fine dining to a food court. Movie theater and bingo room also on property. Lots of parking all around the casino."}
{"text":"This is a very nice casino. It is yet another of the Station chain, which I very much like. We enjoyed the gambling, and the buffet even more. If you are in the Henderson area, this is a very good place to go."}
{"text":"This may be an older great hotel for an off strip location but avoid the Thanksgiving Brunch.  I know more professional reviewers have it on their top 10 buffets for Thanksgiving but after waiting 3 hours in line for their buffet, it was sooo not worth it.  What is a \"bright\" point is their \"international\" food offerings (basic Italian and Asian food) during the holiday but for the traditional stuff, nothing spectacular.  My fiance and I wished we had gone to M (see my review of this place) or just anywhere else.  The turkey and stuffing were just so so.  They do offer a wide variety of desserts but other than the price, I just don't see the point. Save yourself from this place on Thanksgiving.  It's not worthy of the hours spent in line."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Got in on a pretty inexpensive room deal. I've never minded staying off the strip since the strip is SUPER DIRTY AND CROWDED and parking is free anyways so why not drive in and then explore?  The decoration was cute and the hotel was very big.  Our room seemed huge for what we paid and the bathroom was very nice with a large tub and a large detached shower.  I peeked in on other rooms and was surprised to find that ours may have been one of the smallest.  It seemed you could get really large rooms at this place and that's what you're looking for if you're with a big group so I definitely stowed that information away for later use.   The shops attached to the hotel were also delightful.  I enjoyed the nice outdoor furniture at the shops and I ate at a restaurant with my mother that was very good.  The casino was standard and new with a bingo room and all the crazy machines you could expect to see at a casino.  It wasn't SUPER HUGE but it was big enough for me.  I won some bingo and I won on a penny machine.  The room had a stocked mini-bar and you could get food brought to your room as well (normal things but worth mentioning).   I enjoyed the pool the most.  Since this is a resort it has a lovely pool area and you can even reserve a small pool if you want your own privacy.  I just used the general pool and enjoyed it.  There was lots of staff on hand to give you towels and offer to bring you food and or drinks.  I'm the kind of person who likes to be left alone and they only bothered me once so I was happy with that.  They even had large outdoor lay-about areas on the patio that weren't exactly poolside but were for lounging outdoors in the sun.  Upon check-in I had heard something odd about the pool being closed at 5pm but I think that must've been just ONE of the pools because there were more than one.  Also, the check-out time was late for most hotels and you could extend your check-out without charge if you wanted to lounge around the pool well past noon on the following day after your night's stay.  This feature was great because that is often my desire from Vegas.  I noticed they had a library on every hotel floor but I didn't get to go inside and I regret that now given the decor.  I could see a library being styled pleasantly and having a lovely pool and strip view.  I just think it was an overall positive stay with no hiccups.  The parking was odd and it was a long walk to the rooms but that was the only negative thing that could be said about my whole stay and that is actually pretty common for Vegas casino hotels (and I have stayed in many) so I didn't think it a big drawback.  Inside the casino they had food places, a Starbucks, and a movie theater.  So they just weren't lacking in anything and there was even a Whole Foods within walking distance (not that I needed it).  I enjoy any place where I can have a good time all day without leaving.  That being said, I didn't stay too long at the hotel because I wanted to see some of the new casinos on the strip and I had a date with the neon graveyard.  I recommend this place and recommend finding deals on sites like travelocity, priceline, trip adviser, and kayak.  Great deals and great service!  I would definitely stay again."}
{"text":"Just visited the GVR resort and overall great experience. The resort is beautiful but had an awkward layout. The rooms were beautiful. The only complaint was there was only one trash can which was hidden under desk. Fyi I used the trash alot in bathroom vanity area when applying my make up. But small detail. The pool area was beautiful as well. The self parking garage was kind of hard to get back & forth to from room. Had to go up and down elevators and down different halls. But I did get lots of exercise doing it. We wanted to be away from LV strip so the location was perfect. We will visit again."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this resort.  First with the positive: One star for the pool area. I was actually here one night for business but the pool looked awesome. Really nice cabanas.  One more star for the room service. Very good selection on the menu and very quick service. I ordered yogurt and coffee and it took 10 minutes.  Now for the bad: The room was awful. Only 2 bath towels! At 4am I woke up to drip, drip, drip drip, drip.  There was a leak and I had water dripping down onto wet carpet.  See photo.  The casino was ok. Felt more like an Indian reservation rather than Vegas. A lot of penny slots. Very few tables and the staff was unfriendly. No one really talks. Very odd. I had heard really good things about this place but it left me pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Man, I love this place!!!!!! We received a luxury suite for only $125 through Priceline! Our room had a grand piano, an 8-chair dining table, and 3 (3!) full bathrooms. When we checked in, we requested a room with 2 beds because we were a group of 4, but the concierge said that we would be downgrading if we did that. We took his advice and we lived like kings and queens for the night!  It seems like this place has its own zipcode--it's that big! I've stayed in Vegas countless of times, but always on the Strip. Most hotels have their casinos attached to it, right? We saw the ranch's casino and drove to it, but the parking attendant said that the hotel was a few minutes away. This hotel does have a casino, but it's a lot smaller than the first one we went to. I loved it because the bets were as low as $5 (super low for a 3-day weekend!).     What's even more amazing is that they offer complimentary use of their spa! This might be a 'duh!' moment for you, but this was something new to me! Why wasn't I told of this before?! I just lounged in their spa area using their steam room, sauna room, spa, quiet room, etc. after we checked out and until I had to get ready for a wedding I had to attend.   They had a beach pool that sparkled beautifully at night and glistened in the morning. As I'm getting older, I appreciate these kinds of hotels in Vegas more. Meaning, hotels away from downtown Vegas that offer peace and quiet, but not too far away if I wanted to party the night away."}
{"text":"Stayed here back in June - Loved that this place is off the strip yet just a short drive to where all the action is.  Nice lobby, nice grounds, nice rooms - no complaints here!  Loved lounging by the pool.  Was decently pleased with our stay that I plan on going back there to stay in November."}
{"text":"Pool time! Reserved the cabana and amenities included the beverages in the mini frig and a fruit platter. Yay! Our lead server was so energetic and patient with our deciding of food order. We order nachos, cheeseburger, sangria.... To our surprise the back up tall server- runner? Brings us the wrong order. We tell her its not our food and she argues with us! She insists that it is our food. Ummm, pretty sure the 2 sandwiches is not the cheeseburger and nacho. She takes it away in a huff, no apologies, no follow up. Anyways, we later get our correct order and get better service from our lead server. And enjoy the rest of the day lounging at the pool."}
{"text":"I visit this hotel 30+ times a year. The buffet is outstanding and the price is unbeatable.  A full buffet of Italian, Seafood (crab legs included) , prime rib and the list goes on and on. The service is outstanding and they treat my 88 year old father  amazing. The proximity to the airport is 10 minutes.  The availability of handicap parking wheel chairs and  just about anything a senior citizen might need is readily available. My father and I love this place. By the way a new Whole Foods  opened just across the street."}
{"text":"Cons... 1. We reserved a King and they gave it away, gave us a 2 queen room instead.  2. Water pressure sucked in the shower and only big enough for one 3. All the restaraunt's in the Casino closed at 10pm except for Fatburger 4. Would not honor an early checkout, was not able to lay by the pool on our last day there. 5. Desk staff not overly friendly   Pros... 1. GORGEOUS hotel and rooms! 2. Beautiful pools 3. Offrering 2 nights for the price of one on the internet. 4. Off the strip and it was nice and quiet  Overall, not sure I would stay again. They could have cared less that we had to change rooms after checking in. No upgrade offered. Not very friendly and I feel funny about giving people like that money :)"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. We waited in the line for the Buffet for nearly two hours. We got to the front of the line 10 min before 9 where we were then told we needed to finish eating by 945 even though we hadn't even been seated yet. The price was not reduced and signs were not posted. I will never come here again and I'd warn anyone else of the same"}
{"text":"I've stayed at GVR a few times, many years ago . Everything was excellent , I tell my friends , if you take a way the casino , you'd be at a beautiful resort in scottsdale.  Now this time , i was passing thru Henderson and stopped for Brunch on a Friday, The Feast was including tax , less than $6.00 what a deal !!, excellent quality and variety . after filling up , I played a bit , Here's my 1 complaint  only 1/2 of 1 pit of table games were open, so I have to evacuate from the knuckleheads staying on soft 17 , and venture into The High Limit room , which was excellent with service from the talented Dealers , competent supervisors  and lovely cocktail servers. . But where was  ANDY H. ?   LOL"}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BAD ASS POOL ONLY!!!!! (You have been for warned) -   PROS - -   Big beds (king size?) with lots of pillows to catch rays on! Some covered with TVs and ceiling fans in em! oh yeah. My fav beds are the ones in the middle of the pool area. Under the rows of palms. Lotsa pillows!   REALLY great music played from speakers over head in palms.   Lg. teak lounge chairs w/ cushions to, ya know LOUNGE!!   Cocktail servers that are fast and friendly! Yay!   Chic pool and sandy beach w/ lounges you can drag in the water w/ sandy floor.   Water pads you can lay on lounges in like 6 ins of water - in the pool!   Very cool bar! Air conditioned. Sells sunscreen and glasses!   Great menu w/ yummy salads, wraps, frozen grape bowls, hagen-daz bars, nachos like no other!   REALLY soft stripped personal cushion lounge beds right along the pool.   Beautiful girls! They hand out summer passes to Hooter girls, show girls, strippers. Straight up hot bitches.   Located next to spa.   Great lush landscaping.   Misters in all the trees and cabanas.   CONS   Cabanas are over priced and over rated! Far from main pool. Much smaller and slimmer \"VIP\" pools. Did I mention its a waste of $$$?   Sometimes the towel girls can be bitchy (must be the heat).     They have outdoor concerts and events at night that rock! I saw LL Cool J in a summer concert here! It was soooo good! The stage was over the pool and their were people in bathing suits, dresses, pants! LL looked and sounded AMAZING!! They pour heavy on the alcohol and security is pretty calm. They were very 420 friendly and didn't hassle me and my GF (who was waaaassssttted!!) If i could give it 10 stars - I would! Many great memories were made here by me and my girls! Its been too long - must go back asap!"}
{"text":"Although we did not stay at the resort, we stayed nearby. We loved coming to play at the casino.  Ample parking, including garages. Next to the District for shopping. Great sports book and during some of the NFL games there are drink specials at the grill behind the sports book. Poker room is nice and conveniently located near sports book. Lots to eat inside the casino anything from Starbucks,  quick eats to nice sit down restaurants."}
{"text":"For a locals casino i really like GVR.  They have a kick ass food court.  Coffee bean, capriotti, and tropical smoothie?  Oh hell yes.  Makes a fat man die happy right there.  They got a pretty nice movie theatre with an arcade.  and it's right next to district!  And the district is awesome!  I still gotta try out a few of the bars out here though.  (Any takers?) :)  My only complaint is it's a little far from my home so it's not as convenient but if i lived in henderson this would probably be my new go to spot."}
{"text":"Mother's Day 2018 it was totally raining in LA and I needed a quick getaway and some sunshine. I've been to a similar resort in the area but it didn't have child care like Kid Quest (major PLUS) so I chose this over that one.   I wasn't too far from shopping, nice restaurants at hand and a little slot machine action. They have 4 pools (main, spa, cabana area & 21+ lounge type) main pool was actually nice minus the rude staff at the restaurant/bar area who served food/drinks in the food area near there. You don't have to be obnoxious to guests who aren't renting a cabana because you think we can't afford it lol meanwhile all the cabanas were prebooked and I totally forgot to call in advance. My fault. Regardless you have to treat all guests the same!   The Mexican cantina had the absolute BEST SANGRIA I have ever tasted in my life. Felt as if I had 4 bottles of champagne or something.... superb.   Anywho, the rooms were ok, could use some updates because the lobby area going towards the east tower entrance actually looked very modern and upgraded.   My overall stay was okay minus the obnoxious food service staff near the main pool."}
{"text":"I love GVR in multiple aspects... Dining: Hanks happy hour apps and martinis (half price) are bomb rockin. The lump crab is amazeballs!  Dinner there used to be fab but lately the service is sub-sub-sub and more sub-par. Stick to the bar!  Terra Verde is phenomenal; great food and delicious wine. Sushi sake is definitely a fresh and yummy selection as is China Spice. Tides has some great seafood selections and one of those fresh seafood icebar thingys if you're into it. The newish Grand cafe has the same menu from what used to be the original pancake house so it's always a good option. Of course there's the buffet which is pretty awesome for the price.   Drinking: wine @ terra, martinis @ hanks, beer @ Quinn's, anything @ drop!  Recreation: I love the pool at GVR. there's also the private 21+ pool which I haven't been to in ages but is fun w friends. They used to have a locals night. My favorite are the private cabanas with your own private server,stocked refrigerator, Tv, and yummy fresh fruits and food/drinks all day. The BEST.  There's a movie theatre at GVR and my host gives us the private balcony which includes a private butler and all kinds of drinks and food- full menu and bar!  Retreat: The spa and fitness area at GVR are my most favorite anywhere. Private and calm pools, whirlpools, steam room and saunas and incredible service. The spa menu has some inspiring and refreshing drinks...watermelon basil infused water, lavender blueberry OJ. My aesthetician is the best... But I'm sure all are equally phenom. Im not into massages but I hear they are great. A friend of mine is a frequent partaker.   Staying: rooms are clean, plush, and comfortable. The firework suite is my favorite.   Overall, GVR is nothing compared to what it used to be especially in terms of service and amenities, but hopefully that will have a resurgence some day soon!"}
{"text":"Soup contained bones; fried chicken way overcooked.  Pasta overcooked.  To be fair, we were at the tail  end of lunch but there was nothing I liked except the pork.  Perhaps the dinner buffet is good but the lunch buffet is simply adequate"}
{"text":"Very beautiful hotel & resort. Came to visit a Xmas event and beautifully decorated all over. The staff I encountered was very polite, definitely seemed very family friendly as it wasn't full of partiers running around like the strip hotels have."}
{"text":"Nothing outstanding but a good value for the price. Most items were good, a few not as hot as you might like. Service was timely and friendly."}
{"text":"Great area...nice casino but it seems that not a lot a people come here"}
{"text":"I have been at GVR for a few days now. It is odd to be \"in Vegas, but not really in Vegas.\"  We are staying here for a conference and it feel like Vegas Light!  You still have the casino and the smoke and noise, and a buffet to boot, but you just don't get that Vegas feel.  So this can be either a positive or a negative depending on your Vegas stance. I am a Vegas fan so I am feeling a bit flat and left out.   Now, if you are not a Vegas fan, but a trip to sin city is in your future, then this is the place for you. It's pretty, it's got some good dining options, and you can get a Vegas Light experience. There is a place for your kids to hang out and play, and many places for the adults/big kids to hang out and play. The rooms are spacious and clean and the beds are moderate. Not too soft, not too hard. Much like the rest of the resort, they play it safe by hanging in the middle. The staff is friendly. The housekeeping staff is super friendly, so that's a plus in my book. This place Is big, but not so big like some of the strip casinos, so you shouldn't get too lost (and you'll be able to get your 10,000 steps in if you work at it just a little bit).  The pool area is beautiful, spacious, and welcoming. The hotel is also close to a great shopping center, so there really is a little of something for everyone. I'd totally stay here again if I needed to, but you'll be more likely to spot me on the strip staring at the lights."}
{"text":"The Casino is nice, the food in a couple of the restaurants is good, but I'm never stepping back into that place after what just happened to me at the Poker Room. I don't want to say that it's a meeting room for neo-Nazis or Islamophobes or just ignorant rednecks, but it's not far off. Some man who could have been Mexican, Italian, Arab, or Spanish, got up from the table after he busted out--he didn't say anything, he just moved to another table. Another man at my table keep saying how little class the guy had, how he was a bad loser and an even worse winner, and he repeated it at least three times so that everyone at the table heard and understood. The DEALER said (white fat guy, tall, short hair--he should be at least reprimanded), \"So, you want to send him back?\" I was shocked by that comment. Then another one of these Racist regulars said, \"He's from Armenian--he should go back.\" No one laughed. It was not a joke. I looked at the dealer in the eyes, appalled. He just looked back and dealt. The man who had started the whole thing said something else nasty about the poor man who had simply left the table and I got up and left myself, found my husband, and insisted we leave, even though we were going to eat at the Italian place. In retrospect, I should have gone to the floor manager, but I'm a pretty woman, blond and blue, and I probably wouldn't be taken seriously. What a nasty, nasty bunch."}
{"text":"We booked a night at GVR when our family's AC went out. While the accommodations themselves were very nice, we were highly dissatisfied with how we were treated. The valet locked our keys in the car. The family member we borrowed the car from did not have another set. The valet told us we would have to pay $65 for a locksmith! I asked to speak to the manager who said all that he could do was waive the $25 resort fee. We were appalled. I couldn't help thinking that if we were men in suits driving a BMW and not two lesbians in a Hundai, we would have been treated differently. After emailing GVR, I got one voice mail from an Operations Manager and I have since called back twice with no response. It is totally unacceptable that a hotel of this stature made us pay for their employee's mistake! I would have liked to have gone on here to describe how great it was that management gave us a refund or a voucher for a free night, but they still have not rectified things! Will need to find a new place in Henderson when we come to visit family."}
{"text":"Good buffet, clean casino, well decorated.  Nasty employees. See for yourself. A dealer named Shannon kept her hair over her name tag for good reason. She used her middle finger to push a chip to a woman that questioned if she actually won. The floorman was unfriendly when asked about their card rating system. He couldn't be bothered. A black jack dealer said the carnival games they offer sucked the life out of their tips. I played with eight different dealers Friday night and all except one was silent, glanced at their watches, and acted like it begrudged them to pay a bet. I love the Station casinos. For some reason, this is not the place to gamble. The only saving grace for Greenvalley Ranch is the restaurants and live entertainment. Oh, the cashier when we cashed out was nice. Maybe they need to pay their dealers better."}
{"text":"Restaurants are hit and miss. The sushi spot is a joke. The other spots are ok. The rooms are large comfortable and spacious. Most of the staff are friendly and courteous.  The casino is massive and fun."}
{"text":"I love the Station Casino Buffets! They all have their different variety of food.   This one is smaller then Red Rock ( which is my favorite).   We went on a Saturday night, when they have all you can eat shrimp and prime rib! The prime rib, is to die for. The price wasn't to bad being that we went for dinner, $20 if you get the players card.   Their deserts aren't that great, very sweet! (And I have a big sweet tooth\" their \"homemade Ice cream\" is not homemade.   Over all their service is spectacular, very comfy seating, we waited around 40 minutes in line b fore we were sat, but it was defiantly worth it.   Try their mashed potatoes and their sweet carrots!"}
{"text":"I had a buddy in town that was looking to do some gambling.  We decided  to stop and play Pai Gow at the GVR.  I have been here numerous times in the past to dine, drink and watch movies.  This was my first time at the tables.  The dealers and pit crew were friendly. But best of all, the cocktail waitresses really hustle and were perhaps the friendliest I have dealt with.  Went back a few days later and the service was the same as it has been on the previous weekend."}
{"text":"I am so impressed by Diane at the front desk of this hotel. This is my first stay here. I am in town from Santa Barbara visiting family for my great niece's high school graduation . My son booked online to save money. Diane worked hard to obtain a wonderful upgraded room for 20$ per day on a sold out busy weekend. I am very happy! She is hard working and kind. That kind of service is so appreciated. I already feel welcome. She is even going to call us when our room is ready. Way to go Diane"}
{"text":"This piece of s**t hotel just screwed me over with their reservation system. Somehow using their completely broken reservation web site, I ended up with a reservation for today rather than October, and when I immediately tried to cancel and undo the reservation, they CHARGED ME FOR A ROOM TONIGHT AND REFUSED TO GIVE ME A REFUND. I now have to pay for a room I will not use.  I WILL NEVER, EVER GIVE THESE RIP-OFF ARTISTS MY BUSINESS. EVER.  Hey, Green Valley. If you want to win my business again, refund reservation #JQH6J for 8/29/14. Now is your chance to treat your customers right."}
{"text":"Not worth it! First of all, I booked on hotels.com and it said nowhere that there's an additional $32 fee per day. Secondly, I was put in a hotel room with no air conditioning... in Nevada, in July. It's 115 degrees out and we don't have ac. So we complained and they moved us to another room and the AC was marginally better than the first room but still awful. We had to ask for a fan bc it was so hot. Also, if you don't valet they make you park on the other side of the complex and walk all the way through to the hotel. It's a nice hotel but it's not worth it to not have AC in Las Vegas in July!"}
{"text":"Green Valley is a beautiful resort and is quieter than being at a hotel on the strip. We stayed for six days (Saturday to Friday). But it in no way perfect.   When we checked in they had no non-smoking king rooms available so we were given a double room for the evening. The next morning they had the bell desk hold our bags so they could clean the room. While this took place they had taken our room keys we where left sitting at the pool area for 4 hours waiting for the new room to be ready. While waiting I sat on one of the orange round couches at the pool (all 10 of them where empty) I was immediately asked to move or pay the $100 to rent one.   Wednesday while at the pool 2:30 in the afternoon hotel staff starts to remove all lounge chairs and umbrellas leaving very little space ... there are approx 40 people at the pool at this time. Everyone of the orange couches are being allowed to be used without paying. To be made uncomfortable by staff removing umbrellas, tables and lounge chairs that are being used in the middle of the afternoon is completely inexcusable. The front desk manager did offer to check with the spa and if room in the private spa pool area to make arrangements for me to be able to use it.   Thursday morning 10:30am and again pool area is unavailable. No seating because entire area is set up for an event in the evening. The hotel makes it impossible for guests to enjoy the outdoors, forcing them to the casino or leave the area.   Mind you it is already ridiculous that the pool is closed down every day at 5pm. This makes it impossible for those attending conferences to be able to use the pool.   Service in the pool area is horrible. Hardly ever asked if we needed anything or wanted anything. We had to walk to the bar area and place our orders. The waitresses just walked passed us every time, not asking anything.   Plus is the free valet parking. But it's a pain to find hotel entrance. If you use gps it will take your to casino so you have to drive completely around the resort to find the entrance. If you blink you might miss it and end up driving in circles.   They charge a hefty $100 a day deposit, but it can be used for room charges from hotel restaurants, gift shop etc. The fast food places such as Panda Express do not allow for charging to your room.   Rooms:  The AC units in both room where horrible we have to drop the temp to around 60 degrees to get it even semi comfortable. Other than that the rooms are a nice size and comfortable. But be careful of the mini bar horrible expensive. There is no spare room in the mini fridge for you to place your own water or anything.   We do not require our room to be cleaned everyday, and even then just dumping trash every other day. Wednesday morning 10am maids cleaning rooms next to us turned on the light to have room cleaned, returned at 3pm room hasn't been touched and no maids on the floor. Call front desk and was told, they where done on this floor, if do not disturb light on they won't clean... as picture shows the make up room light was on. The front desk did say that would have someone come up so I could at least get the trash dumped because I didn't want to have to leave room while being cleaned since pool was unusable.   TV is a pain every time you turn it on it has to recalibrate since it's an interactive tv. Channels are so so ... no move channels so stuck with what ever is on regular channels, news channels or sports channels. There is a few music channels if you would like. It's is also pretty cool you can turn the tv sound on in bathroom (no picture just sound).   There is a small in room safe in the closet that you can use which is nice to leave valuables while your out.    Casino area ok, very overly loud due to loud machines. Cocktail service is pretty good. Seemed like most of the card tables are always closed and only one $5 blackjack table ever open. Dealers are friendly for the most part had a couple that were not very nice."}
{"text":"2 queen beds with a pool view - the room is bigger than the average hotel room and the bathroom is also bigger. It has a separate tub from the stand up shower and the toilet is in a separate room.  The pool area is nice.  Jesse was a great cocktail waitress, she has bright red hair.  Sit in her section and you won't regret it.  I can't say the same about the \"pool amabassador\" named Emily.  She was super rude.  I intend to email the hotel about her behavior.  With the exception of Emily, everyone was nice.  I plan on returning again next summer for a week.  This is a perfect spot for a family vacation.  It almost reminds me of being on a cruise ship. I love that they have a movie theatre and CBTL on property and lots of cool shops and restaraunts across the street."}
{"text":"I won't bore you with details of why it's a one star - other than - our car was broken into and the security staff blamed us - FOR PARKING THERE!  My time is more valuable than to trash them in this forum.  It's a -5 stars from us.    Visit at your own risk.  PS - Management is aware of the security staff screw up.  They apologized but in no way offered to cover any damages.  An apology does not make up for \"being raped after being raped\" - a direct quote from the hotel VP."}
{"text":"I recently came here for a business meeting and was bummed to not be closer to the strip. That said, GVR was great - excellent customer service at the VIP line and very attentive staff. We were traveling with an infant, and they supplied the crib and humidifier immediately to our room.  The grounds were well manicured and beautiful. The spa was also very nice, and I loved how we were able to use the steam room and facilities for free. The pool was SO cool - it had a sandy beach on one side. (However, it was often packed and hard to find a place to sit.) The casino was smoky (as expected), but nice. Overall, really pleasantly surprised with this resort - very nice! The restaurant quality was a bit lacking, but it's so close to some great restaurants and bars!"}
{"text":"Nice decor in the entry way (hotel lobby) is really nice. But I was not pleasantly surprised when I entered my room.   Housekeeping cleaned something in the bathroom, but I am not sure what? Rooms are much older, toilets/sinks appear as if the need to be replaced as the sink is stained, floors don't seem to have been vacuumed.   Asked for a room with a view and the young lady said there was a $20 up charge for that.   By the way parking is about a mile away from the hotel, you have to walk through the \"smokey\" casino to get to your room. I guess you can Valet, but that is a hidden cost, even though it is \"complimentary.\"  I am quite underwhelmed and considering going elsewhere as we have just checked in."}
{"text":"Saw a commercial on \"Military Monday\", we had a great two for one dinner buffet, had fun playing blackjack with  the love of my life, got a free t shirt, all is good with the world! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the Green Valley recently for a work trip.  Overall, it was a nice stay -- the place is enormous, staff were all friendly, room was large and clean, and the District next door has some great restaurants to choose from if you don't want to eat in the hotel.  Minor annoyances: the internet connection in the room was spotty, and the gym doesn't open until 6am (my body clock was on East coast time and I really would have liked to get in there earlier).  My biggest takeaway is that this resort isn't sure what it wants to be, and who they want to cater to.  The decor of the hotel and casino reminded me of a Tuscan style -- lots of tan tile and stone, wrought iron, etc - which appeals to a much older crowd as evidenced by the large number of retirees in the casino.  But the pool area is the opposite -- sleek, modern, hip, full of 20-somethings getting drunk and tan.  It made me laugh to walk with much older folks through the casino and see big posters for the weekly \"Brazilian beach party\", with photos of young girls in teeny weeny bikinis.  Overall, if you want to stay in the Vegas area without being right on the Strip, Green Valley is a good place to stay.  If you can get a decent rate, it's a good deal."}
{"text":"I haven't stayed in the hotel, however I do gamble here every now-and-then. I live right down the street from this casino, it is very nice and the dealers are great people, very personable.   I'm not rating it a four because I win money here, because in fact I think it is a hard casino to win at. I am giving it a four because of the dealers and their personality and how well I am treated here. I'd give it a five if I would have won yesterday, but thats life ;)  Station Casino's are pretty good at what they do, the prices of the drinks are kind of up there, but if your gaming they take care of you.  The pool overlooking the city is one of the best features of this hotel. You can fall in love with the view. They did a great job on their pool, and I'm sure I'll hit it up during the summer time :)  As far as gaming goes, if your playing blackjack, ask to talk to a pit-boss and ask them the rules, on playing multiple hands, going out and coming back in. They seem to change it weekly but its good to be on top of it."}
{"text":"*this review is for their cage*. For the last 6 months I have been cashing my checks there. I like the free drink ticket and also comp points. The last two months I have cashed a check every weekend and tipped generously. It was between my base pay, bonuses and commission checks that I had a check every Friday. They all ranged from $1k to 2.5k... Until today when I tried to cash a $3.3k check. I wrongly assumed since all of the checks are from the same company and already in the system that id cash this one no problem. But apparently everything over 3K depends on your players status... Wtf? I do not use my players card every time I gamble. I don't use my card when I book my room there or use their spa. But that's irrelevant to their manager on duty. Apparently I had to have gambled at least $500 in the last 30 days to cash my check... The one that's only $500 more than the $2.5k one they cashed the week before. Yes, I did put play the slots, bought drinks, tipped employees... But that's irrelevant. But that's fine, you can have your crazy policy in place. Not sure if they know this but there are other casinos in this town that would gladly accommodate a local who DOES spend money at their properties. Goodbye GVR!!"}
{"text":"My wife and i came here last week. Very clean, large bay window view and very friendly service.9 One of the best amenities is the patio of green valley?"}
{"text":"Epic fail. What hotel, a so called locals hotel closes the pool at 3pm on 4th of July! What are we suppose to do with the kids? Play slots?? Not cool and to add salt to injury I called to verify pool hours a week ago and they said it would be open til 8pm. So when I call to discuss with front desk they inform me it was a corporate decision and they can't do anything about it. Ok that makes it better. Never staying here again."}
{"text":"Amazing hotel and staff, they pay attention to the smallest details. We usually go to Bellagio but will be here from now on. I really appreciate the polite staff and very clean rooms. See you next month for another long weekend."}
{"text":"Wanted some crab legs and prime rib- it was salty! Too salty I felt my legs swelling up! I don't know why they douse their crab legs with so much salt. Prime rib so chewy you just keep chewing. I paid $28 and waited 30 minutes in the president line for this. The only good things our waiter Hue, the pizza believe it or not and the dessert. The attendant at the Mongolian station didn't even bother with me and I was waiting for quite awhile. If you want good food go to Aria. See my review for aria. The hostesses were all friendly!"}
{"text":"This was my family's first visit to the resort, but not to the area.  We wanted to try somewhere new, but wanted to avoid the frenetic pace of the Strip.  When we arrived we were warmly greeting by the parking crew who took our car, then we were greeted again by the front desk staff who were extremely kind and welcoming, in fact every single employee we ran into during our stay was so extremely professional and warm.  Our room was absolutely beautiful, great bath tub and shower, comfortable beds, and everything from the lobby, to the halls, and especially our room was so fresh and clean.  The resort offers several great restaurants, it is located near a great shopping area, and we also enjoyed the gaming area while our daughter absolutely loved the on-site play-area/childcare and their kind staff.  We stayed 3 nights, really loved all of the holiday themed activities including ice-skating and the decorations, quiet evenings in, and just the most peaceful environment.  We are definitely coming back again.  NOTE: The front desk staff and valets were exceptional.  I had several occasions to go to the front desk for help or questions and the could not have been happier to help, they were conversational and treated me like I mattered.  One morning there was only one young lady working at the front, and as I waited only a short time, I saw her calmly field questions and check-ins, doing the job of several people.  The valet folks are hard-working, so polite, and they had many great suggestions for local places and directions."}
{"text":"GVR is one of the Station Casinos for locals. I haven't stayed here but I've frequented for gambling or dining.  It has a high ceiling for good ventilation and an open feel.    There is a huge variety of dining options for various pleasures - an Irish pub, an American cafe, a Fine steakhouse, buffet, oyster and seafood option plus a food court.  There you can find coffee or a frozen yogurt! Like I said... Many options! There is also a movie theatre on the lower level.    They have a free station card to sign up for which gets you discounts at the buffet and able to enter many of their promotional giveaways.  Numerous times I've received coupons in the mail for dining.  Hooray!   GVR also is located to the District which has many shops and restaurants.  It is a great area and location! I always enjoy my visits to GVR resort and casino!"}
{"text":"I enjoy grabbing a drink at the center bar. Love happy hour at Hank's. I just wish there weren't so many zombie-like people. To be expected at our local casinos I suppose.  If you spend enough time here you will smell like smoke.   I prefer here over the M because of The District...the bars and restaurants available to you once you step out of the casino make it more appealing."}
{"text":"Run of the mill corporate casino WAAAAY off the strip.   Had brunch here for around $20 dollars.  It was pretty good.  Shot dice for 3 minutes, hit two points and left. Paid for brunch."}
{"text":"Okay, so I got a pretty decent rate for this place so I booked it, BUT once they add the 24.99 plus tax a night resort fee, it was no \"deal\" at all.   The resort itself is nice. The rooms are clean, nicely appointed, and comfortable. The front desk staff upon check in was fine, but the food on their \"supposedly\" 5 star restaurants was a joke. we waited over an hour (after ordering) for our breakfast...eggs and toast and some hollandaise sauce. The eggs came out after sitting for so long that the yolks were grey and the hollandaise had a thick crusty coating on top..I would have been better off eating some thing out of a vending machine.     The night shift must be the \"b\" team. Unfortunately, we were on a floor with a large party that insisted the hallway was part of their rooms and they kept us up until about 2 o'clock before security finally got them to stop.    Do yourself a favor and skip the bars at the resort (especially is you see Will behind one of them). The drinks are OUTRAGEOUS and they don't even make them right. The bartenders have horrible attitudes and there are plenty of restaurant bars across the street that would gladly welcome you. (try AL's garage; awesome joint, good drinks, open 24/7).  We had a coupon for buy one get one free at some of the bars on the property, we order 2 shots that we were charged 12.00 a piece for and the rude bartender told us they weren't included in the 2 for 1 but wouldn't give us our drink coupon back. We went to the front desk to ask for a comment card and the desk attendant told us he would get one...we stood there for 10 minutes and he sent a some one else to come deliver them to us. When we filled them out and returned them, he walked around the corner and threw them in the trash.   I guess if you like to sit by a pool then maybe this place is for you, but if you appreciate even a decent meal or drink and perhaps a good attitude to the folks you are paying 125.00 plus a night for then go to the strip where people actually appreciate you as a patron."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ever wanted to give negative stars.   My husband and I stayed here with his company for their annual meeting that was held in the resort.  When we first drove up the signs to find the hotel entrance were non existent so we had to park in self park and walk through the casino.  Fine, whatever, its Vegas.  Except there is no clear way to get from the casino into the hotel...we were very lucky another guest showed us the super secret door.   Our room was nice, nothing spectacular, and nothing compared to other rooms in Vegas.  That first night my husband's company hosted a cocktail reception for us that took place partially outside by the pool.  They were varnishing the pool area that night so we were treated to fumes and bright flood lights!  Excellent!  The next morning I woke up and grabbed an apple juice out of the mini fridge.  I took once sip and almost spit it out- something was not right with the juice.  Turns out that it was expired by 3 months.  It turns out EVERYTHING in our fridge was expired by 3 months!  It took 3 calls to get them to bring up new juice.  Oh, but I haven't gotten to the part where the fun really begins!  I am getting ready for the formal dinner that the company hosts and I go to put on makeup.  I realized that my Louis Vuitton bag (makeup inside) as well as a vintage beaded clutch were missing!  Gone! Completely!   What ensued after that was nothing short of insanity.  GVR kept hinting that my husband stole the bag.  Yeah, ok.  They \"investigated\" and their conclusion was \"well, the maid said she didn't see it, so she didn't take it.  Are you sure you even had this bag in the first place?\"  Wow, thats not insulting, not at all.  I fully admit that I should have tried to stuff my bag into the tiny safe they provided.  But they should have been at least a little more responsive to the fact that one of their guests was robbed in one of their rooms.  We were given the complete run around everytime we called them, bounced from department to department.  On our last day there we had no other option to call the Henderson police...who we quickly realized were going to be of no help since they don't conduct their own investigation.  If GVR had at least treated us with a modicum of decency and respect it would have been a different story.  But it was more than obvious to us that this was a mis managed property concerned with nothing more than making $$, certainly not concerned with their guests satisfaction.  Some other things about GVR I didn't like-  - The half sand pool.  Totally a personal preference but I am not a fan.  - The distance from the strip.  Don't believe them when they tell you its close, its not.  Its at least a good $25-30 cab fare each way.   - The \"shuttle\".  The Shuttle to the strip runs very infrequently and stops early in the evening.  It also only carries 14 people...so if you aren't one of the first 14 in line you have a long wait ahead of you.  We hadn't seen American Casino before staying here, then got to watch a couple of episodes after staying.  If that show didn't make it more than obvious that the hotel and casino were mismanaged. . .needless to say we were horrified when we saw the episode where they had to close the restaurants for health code violations.  Bleck!"}
{"text":"While beautiful and very clean rooms, I am giving this resort a three star for a few reasons. 1: floor plans and signage is confusing and frustrating to find where you need to be. 2: help in the hotel looks at you like you have two heads of you ask any questions.  3: pricing. Wow. 4:  wait staff can't be bothered in the restaurants unless you go to Hanks and pay $100 per person plus drinks. They were great in Hanks but VERY expensive but the other restaurants had horrible and slow service."}
{"text":"I stayed here during a business trip. The property was beautiful and had all that I would have expected. The restaurants were very good, and provided several options.   Overall I enjoyed my stay very much and would definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"I came out to bingo and the girl ANA that was serving the drinks was very rude and disrespectful I ordered a 1water and a 1cocktail when she came around in the middle of the game she asked if anybody needed cocktails I asked for a cocktail she said I already have 2 drinks and she served the guy across from me 2 cocktail and 2 beers and he already had 1 beer so total of 5 drinks   She is a very rude bartender and disrespectful person"}
{"text":"What a complete and total disappointment. Had a massage here a few months ago, that was horrible, the masseuse was actually texting on her phone as she was rubbing the back of my leg with one hand, anyway we didn't stay the night at the hotel a few months ago, but we decided to give it a try for this weekend. I booked our room two months ago, requested non smoking, upon arrival they were complete booked and only had smoking rooms. We said we would give it a try and it was unbearable. Even the bellman said it was awful. So we requested to move. We the only room left... the \"70's\" room. And it looked just like that, straight out of the 70's. Not impressed, everything was 70's inspired but without the amenities of the 20th century. The tv does not work, the bed is hard and I wouldn't dare sit on the couch. Yuck NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"Live like a king. Great food, great pool, great view."}
{"text":"Very nice and new resort. When I first walked it I was really impressed by the beauty and charm of it. It's a very clean and nice resort with a nice contemporary decor.   The pool area was really gorgeous. All of the pool chairs were cushioned and extremely comfortable. Also, there are a ton of misters around to keep you cool.  The activities at the resort are really clever. I think this resort is one of the more kid friendly resorts around and in Vegas. They have an arcade along with a movie theater for kids to enjoy. They also have a drop off kids camp that has a bunch for kids to do.   The food and the service at the resort was what the resort needs to work on. We went to the grand cafe for breakfast and we were there for over two hours!!! I waited about 15 minutes for a cup of coffee and another 45 minutes for my food. Plus, the food isn't worth the wait either.  Overall, beautiful and homy resort with really beautiful rooms (at least ours was.) I especially enjoyed all that the hotel had to offer and just all around had a great decor. But the food and service wasn't up to par compared to Vegas standards. I would totally recommend this resort otherwise."}
{"text":"The Manager at the Grand Cafe is very RUDE and does not do his job well. He should find a different line of work that does not involve customer service! Sean is his name. Wow is all I can say. Just wow.   It's making me leave a star. I don't want to tho."}
{"text":"Good Station Casino right off the 215 freeway in Henderson. It is a modern casino with good attention to detail. Nice renovated sportsbook. Could use a cafe. Over all the restaurants are ok with Hanks being the best but severly over priced."}
{"text":"Very clean, no overwhelming smoke smell in the air! Great place to watch the fireworks on New Years Eve!"}
{"text":"Nice hotel/resort. Very pretty. Big room & bathroom.  My only disappointment was they closed the pool down one day for a \"party\" or group. It would have been nice that they informed the guest this ahead of time. No sign nothing. Pretty disappointing.  Lastly, the shuttle service is the worst! Doesn't seem to go to or from the hotel when you arrive or depart to the airport. Other hotels on the strip take you as you need to go. So should this hotel."}
{"text":"Beautiful resort. Great amenities. But given a 2 for the establishment employees. That all seem so unhappy.  I have been coming for the last 3 years. Either they are unhappy or racist and don't want to smile or help me.  Gone to all the restaurants.  Really disappointed. See we'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This casino is GREAT if you want to have the fun of gambling in Vegas without all the riff-raff and dirt of the strip.  It's a fantastic spa/hotel/casino and it has a wonderful view of all the hotels below on the strip...just far enough away to feel like an oasis yet close enough to still cab it.  I'd say it's about 12-13 miles so prepare for a slightly more expensive taxi fare than say if you were going from the strip to downtown.  GVR is so nice if you are going to relax with your honey, chill with family, or for even celebrating a bachelorette party.  I've done all three and can attest that the resort accommodates all three!  The rooms are great...marble counters in the bathroom, a full size hairdryer, separate tub, shower AND toilet (own room!).  The bedroom area is equally lovely...either 2 queens or a king...high thread count sheets, pillows that are squishy with the right amount of firmness, a mini bar complete with a \"sexy\" kit, medicine for hangovers, and all the ingredients with which to make your own, in-room 'tini!!  The spa is a tad confusing but nice...indoor and outdoor hot tubs.  Be prepared to pay a resort fee JUST to use the spa even if you're not getting a service.  Oh, and the services are WAY pricey...like upwards of $150 for a 50 minute massage.  If you want something cheaper, head across the way to the Aveda salon where they offer an $80/hour version and it's a close walk.  The Cafe in the casino has great late-night dining and the Sports Book has some kick-ass, huge screens on which to watch your favorite team( ahem, GO PATRIOTS!) play.  Oh, and if you bet on a sports, be sure to ask for a FREE drink ticket.  You get one free well or domestic beer with a bet. :) Also make sure you get a player's card if you play blackjack or slots, etc.  You'll get \"free\" stuff the more you gamble...so if you are going to lose that cash anyway, might as well get a few free bets and/or a free pack of cigarettes if you are into it. lol  The Whiskey Bar is also nice...especially in summer when you can chill out under the cabanas outside and get bottle service. Fun place to dance...and if you DON'T like the bumpbumpbumpbump of the DJ...I suggest you request a room NOT facing the pool lest you want to hear it ALL night while you sleep. lol"}
{"text":"What is that smell in my room the place Stinks like sulfur. We just checked in and it smells like a bad sewer smell I called down there they switched my room from way up to Tim Buck too never again this place sucks. Wait to I see my travel agent at AAA"}
{"text":"I liked staying here, for the most part. It's gorgeous and our suite made me feel like a princess. Everyone was pretty friendly and accommodating..... until I got to the casino.   The only issue I have with the entire place are the terrible attitudes I ran into there. There is one particular female dealer who shall not be named and I'm sorry to say this, BUT she has permanent bitch face. She acted genuinely irritated as hell to be doing her job of playing games. It was bizarre. Also, when I went to cash out the cashier was irritated because I didn't stand in the right spot or walk up to the counter fast enough. She berated me like I was a child and said, \"it says RIGHT THERE that this is the line for chips.\" There was only one line open in the whole place, so I'm not sure why that mattered at all. Also, the other closed lines had the same sign?? She made me feel ridiculous after I had waited for her help for almost 15 minutes. It took her 3 seconds to count my money and then she basically threw it at me like I couldn't leave fast enough for her. I'll admit, this was my first time in a giant casino, so maybe I'm ignorant about where to stand myself. How. Ev. Er!, if I'm dropping a billion dollars on my weekend maybe chill the hell out. I'm so sorry you picked a job working with idiots like me, but I promise it's not deserving of your nasty eye roll. Not the best first impression. I'll probably gamble somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"What an incredible disappointment !!! A few months ago I purchased an auction item for St Jude's children's hospital , it featured 2 nights in a Luxury suite at this \"hotel\"... With breakfast etc... I live  in Los Angeles  and as an active member of  The charity it seemed right to bet on this deal and come visit my Vegas friends, I invited  the manager of a CVS pharmacy, the CEO of a major Coaching company, and a lactation expert in a Summerlin famous hospital, along with 3 ,17 years old ....their kids...A very civilized and educated group of people who came to have Thai food with us in the Tuscany suite of 2000 sq feet with a large dining  table that seemed to be \" inviting\"....in Any case after 20 min in our dinner , as civilized and normal as could be , 9.20pm someone knocks at that door , my husband sees those 2 men, one claiming he received several complaints from guests about us making too much noise to which all of our faces dropped !! How could it BE? Were we in the famous Las Vegas on a Sunday night November 10th  ?? No School on the 11th right ? only chewing our foods and laughing here and there to our friends jokes. By the way they all intended to go back to their respective beautiful homes early (and  decoration-wise much prettier than that overdone Rococo suite) .... I think that this pretentious hotel thought we planned on ALL  sleeping there ! What a joke! They kept on coming back and the 3rd time planned on getting my non-registered guests outside the room cause they were now 6 men, 2 of them in yellow plastic suits claiming to be security ! My friends and I  took our phone and started filming ,which immediacy calmed them down ... I forgot to say that we are a group of 50 year old people and our kids were there NO WE MADE NO NOISE!!!! A DINNER that left such a bitter taste to my life after my guests heard twice they will be asked to leave!!! We all left!!!  I feel that The Green Valley Ranch is the worst experience I ever had.... Very disappointing to look forward to a nice and relaxing 3 days week end in a \"luxury \" hotel and get a very angry little man, telling us to behave or else .....  It is the first time in my entire long life that I have been subject to such a treatment. I have been a fan of the red rock hotel for a long time and stayed at the top floor suite for events, and parties  ,many times ,This really does not reflect right on the owners of the stations nor to their commitment to their guests.  And guess what... I left a message at the very apologetic reception desk asking for a follow up from someone different than the angry power tripping man in charge that night (after all I left  after 5 hours instead of 3 days )  No news.....!    . ."}
{"text":"I am highly disappointed with this hotel. It is a beautiful hotel. The food is great! I am an extremely social person but I continuously felt like an outsider. Each dealer I talked to I felt as if I was a burden on them. I played craps for hours listening to the dealers crack jokes and have a great time and ignore me the entire time! And I was the only player!!!! Don't come to this hotel or casino unless you are a local! They even have \"we  locals\" on each employee badge! I will not be returning! I hate doing bad reviews. And do not take them lightly. I spent all day trying to disprove my experience! Just didn't happen. There are so many other places to stay as a \"non local\"... stay anywhere else!"}
{"text":"What are the greatest places that I've ever stayed at home to Tony Curtis while his house was being built this places is just like Palm Springs"}
{"text":"Recently bought a groupon for Green Valley Ranch.  Purchased it for a staycation. Although It is a gorgeous property, their resort fee is ridiculous, being about $29.00 per day.  Also they put a $100.00 per day hold on any credit card you use.  This is very inconvenient.  And to top it off, got home and found out my credit card had fraudulent activity on it.  I know it came from this property, because I never use that credit card.  I used it because of the $100.00 hold per day.  They put wine glasses in the room, just in case you want to drink the wine in the mini bar that is in your room. However no coffee pot, no complimentary coffee at all.  This will force you to go downstairs and purchase a cup for $3.75 at the cafe.    Also I believe my sunglasses got stolen out of my room when we were at breakfast.  They were expensive Maui Jim sunglasses.  Beware if you go to Green Valley Ranch."}
{"text":"I reserved a King bed room at GVR and hit the road from Los Angeles excited about adding an extra day to the start of my trip.  I got there 5 hours later, after the long drive, ready to shower, relax and have a great time.   The rude woman at check in said they had no more king beds but they'd give me two queens.   I told her I specifically confirmed a kind bed.   I asked her if they had any Kings on the entire property.  She said I'd have to pay the upgrade fee for a suite.  I asked to speak to a manager and she said, \"I am the manager\".    I went to find someone else in the hotel because this woman obviously wasn't looking to help me.  I found a floor man on the casino level.  He went off to \"look into it\" and then didn't even have the balls to come back and talk to me face to face.  He called the security guard at the station he left me standing at, and the guard told me the same thing. They couldn't do anything for me.  So they'd rather leave my reservation empty and a king suite empty than comp me a suite due to their mistake.     I left furious and to top it off they had the audacity to try and charge my card the reservation fee of $178!!    NEVER stay here, EVER!!   Worst Vegas experience I've had."}
{"text":"We stayed here two nights using a Groupon deal that included $50 credit and breakfast buffet for two days.  The bed was comfortable, the room was clean and quiet.  The place is a resort and is upscale all around.  You can get to your room without going through the casino depending on where you park which is rare in any Vegas hotel. The lobby though is not easy to get to as it is on the floor below the main floor.  Plenty of parking.   We used the adult pool and regular pool.  The adult pool is small but the lounge seats are nice.  The regular pool has sand to simulate a beach and the pool staff is good eye candy for both men and women.   The hotel is across from a shopping center that was practically empty.  There are sit down restaurants and fast food places in the hotel..  We ate at their buffet and Tides restaurant which I reviewed on Yelp.    The place is about a 15 minute drive to the strip with no traffic."}
{"text":"The rooms were clean and very nice, but the lay out is horrible, we had to walk miles to get to our room which overlooked the top deck of the parking garage, easy enough for the hotel to fix by adding some other security doors/entrances.  Station Hotels are all over the Las Vegas/Henderson area but do not understand why Green Valley charges 5x more then the Sunset, Fiesta, or the Santa Fe, they all have plenty of different food choices, all have a nice movie mulitiplex,  and spa and swimming pools, and  if you want to see the Las Vegas strip you have to drive or take a cab, they all have retarded resort fee which is hidden till you arrive and check in. weekend room at Green Valley will run 100.00+ yet the same room type at Santa Fe is 29.00.  They also offer a kid day care area with plenty of stuff for the kids to do, but feel if you are a guest or come to play in there casino you should not be charged, just leave a tip for the persons working there, If they can give you all the free drinks and comps on your players card, then why not daycare to allow parents to gamble and not have to pay."}
{"text":"This is really a solid place, depending on what you're looking for...  Food? Great choice! There's Pizza Rock that serves great selections of both pizza and beer (even some rare ones every now and then). There's Borracha that serves great Mexican food, Bottiglia for great Italian food....  Entertainment? This is one of our go to movie theaters. Not big gamblers but I did play craps here once and it was fun, dealers were chill and cool guys. Haven't been to the other bars or played table games, honestly if I was looking to just gamble I'd probably brace the strip but all the people I see playing seem to be enjoying themselves.  If you're local it's really worth stopping in and checking out."}
{"text":"First, I want to thank the casino for my winnings.  Second,  I have never in my life felt so upset because of an employees complete disregard for service.  While it obvious they have new team members on board because of season, the managers need to set expectations and ensure invited guests are given respect.  The casino cage was so out of in their comments made toward me.  Just because I'm Hispanic and dress casual doesn't give anyone the right to discriminate. When bought to a manager the issue was basically brushed off.   Horrible treatment!!"}
{"text":"Steaks are among the best.  Service always good.  Prices within reason.   One of best off strip."}
{"text":"Staying here as I write this. Great looking place! Rooms are very nice. Big and roomie. Mattress is so comfy! Food is everywhere and all good!  Now the best part.....I hit two royal straight flushes within 4 hours on the 100% payback video poker machines and there are quite a few of them!  Pool area is spectacular! Rivals any one on the strip! Rooms aren't cheap, about 150 after that resort fee ripoff but they're all doing it here now.  Definitely would stay here again! Friendly staff, great buffet."}
{"text":"I must say that I expected more. First of all I check in and I am given a room with double beds versus the single king bed I booked. Then I get to my room facing the casino parking lot with lots of noise. The sink in my restroom is painted and peeling with mildew! Yuk! I call the front desk and I am moved after already being unpacked!  I paid for upgraded internet that didn't work and tech support said they would send a tech to my room that never did show up! Grrr  At check out the clerk has a bad attitude! Screws up my bill by $205! I ask to speak with a manager that has me waiting for 45-mins! Wouldn't recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Being caught up in the Christmas season, my girl and I were invited to Green Valley to enjoy some holiday cheer with friends. We were, get this, poolside with a fire pit, jingle jingle. There was an ice skating rink set up a stones throw away, cocktails a plenty and fixins for smores, it was so grand. I do not skate but my woman does so she tore it up, I do however drink and eat smores so this is where I did my triple toe. Music was playing,  toasts were made and I even had a hot chocolate with plenty of spirits. Lots of love to GV staff."}
{"text":"We have finally stayed here for Our Anniversary. It was so nice and clean. We overlooked the pool area which was beautiful. The bed was very comfy and the bathroom was awesome. There is a huge vanity and makeup mirror, deep tub, glass shower, toilet by itself and double doors to get into it. The staff was really sweet and offered us a bottle of water when we checked in. It was room temperature but, my husband likes it that way. We had our car valet and did not cost us extra except for a tip. They made you feel like you were someone special not just another somebody. We will be back."}
{"text":"Poker Room Review:  Great room to play.  Enough tables and people to make it lively but not so  much to suffocate.  The cocktail waitresses were attentive and frequently came back to check on us.  It's definitely a nice stop before heading out to the Whiskey Bar. Now the locals playing here were a different story.  Well, there was only one annoying dude. For the most part, locals like to play just to play.  I know this sounds naive but the truth is if locals wanted to make some real money they'd probably go play on the strip and work the tourists (unless they work for one of the big casinos that is). Anyway, there was this dude bent on winning millions at a 2-4 table.  2-4 is by very definition a starters table or just wanted kill some time table.  It is not the win it big and retire tournament table.  Here's the hand that typified this guy's disillusionment:  Dude:  I got aces so I'm going to raises $2 (this is after after the flop and with only $8 in the pot) Most people fold because who bluffs at a 2-4 table? My Friend: I'll pay to see that (calls the $2 bet) Fourth street come out Dude: I think my aces are going to hold.  Raise $4. My friend call $4 again. River on board. Dude: This pot is mine.  Raise another $4. My Friend: All I got is nines, but I'll call your $4. The dude had king high.  My friend did have pocket nines.  Total amount of the pot: $28 Amount dude put in: $12 Looking like a jackass: free."}
{"text":"If I could rate a negative star rating I would. I have been going to Green Valley for over 10 years. I am a local. On September 14th we went to go get something to eat at the buffet during the breakfast time around 9 a.m. . We were seated and our server was really nice and great. We went to get our food from the buffet the selection was decent but nothing to Rave about. I went to get a bagel to toast and low and behold I found four Bagles that had mold and things growing off of it meaning they've been sitting in their back bakery storage facility for quite some time. I was Furious not because of the price but because the lack of concern that this company has for their consumers. I asked to speak to the manager on duty I wanted the food and beverage manager his name was Jeff I showed him what I found and I wanted an explanation as to why his associates failed to do their job correctly meaning to protect the consumer and spoiled rotten food. He said he couldn't give me an answer he didn't know why. He gave me an excuse that one of his associates who was putting out the food didn't have her glasses on and that's why there was moldy Bagels. Really.!?!?# Are you kidding me ?!? That was a joke .Be very very very careful when you eat there and inspect the food. Just because it looks fresh doesn't mean it is. Also make sure that if you do go to the breakfast time inspect all the bread that they have laid out and all the food because you don't know how long it's been sitting there and you don't know if it's fresh I will never step foot back in there again."}
{"text":"This is as classy as you're going to get this close to the suburb of Henderson.  This station casino location is much newer and cleaner than Sunset Station (a few miles down the road), and has more upscale options including a shopping district with an assortment of restaurants and stores.  There are several great bars on property that are great to meet friends local to the area.  Quinn's is a mock irish pub with cheap beer, for instance Hoegaarden for $3, and usually live entertainment.  Beer pong is available on the weekends, for those still wishing to pretend they're in their college years.  Hank's and Drop Bar are also near in the area.    I've lost my hat a few times at the table games, but their lusture always convinces me back for more.  This casino also has electronic craps and roulette, which have much cheaper minimums than their live counterparts - its just missing the yelling dealers and the shame associated with losing in front of an audience.  Overall, a great casino with plenty of offerings to keep locals and tourists alike happy for an evening or two."}
{"text":"This review is for the Green Valley Ranch Buffet...  The buffet at Green Valley Ranch is unique in that they will cook your king crab legs in butter, garlic, tomatoes, and other spices!  It makes the king crab legs 10 times better.  You simply load up your plate with king crab legs as you would at the Bellagio, Wynn, or any other buffet.  You then bring it to the center grill area and the chef will cook your crab legs.  King crab legs will never be the same again once you have tried it here.  The trick is to ask for everything and go light on the butter, because they will soak it with butter if you don't tell them otherwise.  I prefer mine with less butter.  This place is located about 15 minutes from the Vegas strip but it is worth the drive if you have a car.  I wouldn't take a cab ride here unless the craving for these crab legs is so unbearable that you have to have some and pay for it with a hefty cab fee.  Everything else at this buffet pretty much sucks but for $20, the crab legs itself was well worth it."}
{"text":"Pool and Hank's are the only good things in this hotel. Don't buy their gift cards as they will wipe out all of their value  within two years. Was given $500 on gift cards, all zeroed out, called and emailed customer service, they directed me to inexistent phone number."}
{"text":"I used to live down the street from Green Valley Ranch and I hate it. First of all, there is never any parking. They also took out the middle of the 3rd floor of the parking garage and made it for VIPs. Also, the food prices are astronomical and there is always long lines as well. Security guards are rude to minors, especially at the District. If they sit at a bench in the District longer than 10 minutes, security tells them that they sat there too long and that the District is only for adults. The security at the arcade is also strict, they make sure everyone is over 13 and they follow you around. The movie theaters always has long lines and they don't have great showtimes and the concession stands have poor customer service as well."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful spa boutique. Small intimate but with lots of extras. Locals get discounts so make sure to check those out we did the Travel Zoo couples special. Great day."}
{"text":"In town for a conference and was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Typically when I visit Vegas it's with family & friends so we stay on the strip. This is a nice hideaway and clearly geared towards the locals looking for a staycation.  The front desk was super friendly and helpful. My TV wasn't working and they promptly sent an engineer to work on it! The AC is a little slow to cool down but was okay. The room decor is a little outdated but it gets the job done.  After settling in to my room I headed down to take advantage of some gaming before the work week started. The casino itself was pretty loud and offered a decent selection of table games at a reasonable minimum. There are a few spots where the cocktail service wasn't great."}
{"text":"I receive monthly brochures in the mail. It has a 2 for 1 coupon in it for the buffet. I asked a friend to join me for dinner. The buffet at GVR is amazing! Fresh carved turkey, chicken and beef. There is shrimp at the salad bar. Very clean and our server was attentive."}
{"text":"Oh GVR, you bring back so many memories from back when I first ever lived in Vegas. And yeah, I kinda liked you better then. However, you are still 4 stars in my book even now. (Though, I do miss the old you. And am I the only one who remembers the GVR reality show?)  There are good bars, decent restaurants, a great lounge for shows, a nice pool, a great spa, and a coming soon fantastic salon (Brannon Hair is opening a location here).  Plus, you can actually afford to game here. And, oh yeah, it's just up the street from me, so there's that whole convenience thing.  And the rooms, especially the suites, are actually quite fab.  So yep, GVR is a great off-Strip casino."}
{"text":"My company recently held a conference at this resort.  The rooms, grounds, food and staff were fantastic.  it is not located on the Strip, which to me is a good thing, as I think the Strip is kind of trashy.  It does have a casino in the hotel if you wish to gamble  The hotel, conference and pool areas are beautiful.  The rooms seem a little dark and could use more lighting, but the beds are comfortable, the bathroom has a separate tub/shower and a speaker in there so you can hear your T.V. - plus a phone in the bathroom.  I forgot one more thing - so you don't have to knock on room doors, each room has its own doorbell - pretty awesome.  The staff bent over backwards for us during our conference.  We had to change several arrangements for rooms and transportation and they were right there and changed things without complaining.  I know I would not have been so patient.  Thank you, Green Valley Ranch for a great conference.  I hope to come back someday and will tell everyone that it is a great place to hold a conference."}
{"text":"After an awful check in due to some complications with the travel agent, I was a bit irritated. I don't think anyone wants to deal with any kind of complication when they check into a resort for a relaxing weekend after traveling 5 hours to get there. The manager was absolutely amazing, he stepped up after seeing how frustrated I was and took such good care of us. It is a little ways away from the strip but I loved that it isn't filled with drunk, loud people. As someone who visits Vegas often for a quick weekend getaway, I can say this has got to be one of my favorite places to stay in. My husband and I stayed in one of the Grand suites, absolutely beautiful and super clean. Staff were all quite pleasant. The view was absolutely beautiful from our suite, the pool was perfect for the awfully hot weather. The atmosphere was just all around perfect for a nice, relaxing weekend getaway. I have, for sure, bragged about our wonderful stay here to everyone I know. What a lovely place, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Green Valley Ranch is one reason I love living in Las Vegas. The rooms here are super gorgeous, and the view is amazing. The pool is so unique and always a pleasure to spend an afternoon. I can sometimes be found in one of their restaurants or bars, they are mostly good!! The Movie theater here is one of the best in the city and the pool bar cannot be beat!! I love spending a faux vacation at GVR! The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5, is that Red Rock, the sister property beats it somehow!"}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my stay here!  I was here for a business conference and absolutely loved it!    The bathrobes are to die for!  So comfy and soft!  Love the bathrobes!  The Starbucks in the establishment was literally steps away from the conference room my business meeting was in - a huge bonus!  I love easy access to Starbucks!  The room was very nice.  I loved the deep bathroom sink.  It was beautiful and functional which made washing my face feel more luxurious.  Loved the size of the bathroom!  And loved the bath mat!  There was your typical bath mat for the shower and tub, and a soft and delightful small carpet like mat for the sink/vanity.  So appreciated that!  Very nice make up mirror too.  I enjoyed a king size bed and slept so well - very comfortable.  The staff was always courteous and pleasantly helpful.  I particularly appreciated the excellent customer service by the woman who brought me my room service.  She went out of her way to make sure I was happy with what I ordered.  The first day I ordered a small pot of tea and when I ordered it on the second day and the pot was half the size, she brought me an extra pot, even though I told her the smaller pot was fine.  She wanted to make sure what I received was consistent to my expectations.  Above and beyond nice!   I enjoyed the Lobby Bar (except for the horrible smoking by a few patrons).  They had a live DJ and I enjoyed the fun pop music they played.  There was a woman who came from the spa and gave great massages on the spot!  The grounds and pool area look beautiful.  Being winter it wasn't appropriate to use the pool area.  Very inviting to come back!  Cabanas are very cool.  I liked the tall ceilings in the lobby and main hallways.  Gave a feeling of spaciousness and luxury.  The reason I gave GVR 4 stars and not 5 is because of the smoking.  Even in my business sessions my eyes were burning with the affects of the cigarette smoke in the air, even though we were in a separate conference room away from the casino.  I wish the entire establishment was non-smoking.  Smoking really makes for an unpleasant environment.  Overall my stay was very enjoyable.  I would definitely stay here again!"}
{"text":"This is literally my favorite place to hang out, a very nice and calm casino for those who don't enjoy the stress and chaos of the strip casino's. (I live 10 minutes away so that's a plus lol)   But I've just had a staycation at the hotel for just a couple days. They gave me the room an hour early than check in time since it was already ready which was awesome I was expecting to wait. The rooms are spacious and clean, and I really liked the bathroom it was fancy and big as well.   The pool is beautiful and I had the most relaxing day there, and they gave a restaurant and a bar there to get food and drinks from. Didn't try the food and but all the drinks were awesome. They have a spa there that looks awesome for whoever can afford it, and a fitness center that's pretty large for being part of the hotel, I was impressed with it!  I ate at the Cafe, it's open 24 hours and has lunch and overnight specials as well as the regular menu 24/7. It was delicious and service was pretty good.   Too lazy to keep writing more haha. But other pros is that there are multiple great restaurants in the casino and in the district (which is a shopping center right next to it.) As well as the buffet in the casino which I recommend. Haven't gotten to try all the restaurants yet but working on it. There's also good gambling and a movie theater, and a food court as well. Great shopping as well. And if the weather is nice the neighborhood has nice running and biking trails and the area is quiet and safe.  So yes I really do recommend! Also if you wants to go to the strip it's only a 20-30 minute drive away depending on the traffic."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 4 Days and when I say the staff here waits on you dam near hand in foot it really made it a incredible stay. About a 15 min drive to the strip. The amenities are so great , if you stay here I highly suggest trying out the spa in the resort a bit pricey but honestly totally worth it. It is so peaceful and so quite in the resort and it's surround areas I would definitely recommend booking here if you want to go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Ever since this resort was featured on the show Hells Kitchen in 2007 (where the winner became the executive chef of the fine dining restaurant in there) I've been anxious to check this place out & I finally did!  It's one of the cleaner, neater, non-smoker friendly , swankier \"local casinos\" in Las Vegas.   The casino floor is huge. Multiple wings with chock-full- of Slot machines ! Plenty of table games also.   Plenty of food around - from \"food court\" quick fixings to  buffet to restaurants.    Outside in the immediate area is plenty of shopping and restaurants."}
{"text":"Me and my husband stayed here booked a suite for our wedding. Our bridal party also booked rooms here.  The staff made a comment to my bridesmaid for not upgrading to a suite to her coworker. I guess they get bonuses for getting upgrades.  I was requesting a late check out which they charge your fee no matter what. I expressed I got food poisoning and I booked the suite for multiple nights and asked for the fee to be waived the employee on the phone responded \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" what the f!? I felt like I was talking to cable company customer service not a so called \"resort\"  The valet was also rude to my sister who was driving an older suburban they didn't believe that she was staying at the resort. She was just trying to drop off our champagne and breakfast for our bridal party suite. They kept trying to direct her to self park instead of helping her.  Booking a resort for such an important event you expect the resort staff to be more than helpful and kind. During these events and stay the staff did not show any empathy or professionalism. I think they really need to review the management, the management is allowing employees to be so rude to guests."}
{"text":"Green Valley Ranch is my absolute favorite casino in Las Vegas. Staff is professional and super friendly. There are things and activities  for everyone and the buffet has awesome food. You can't go wrong on this property."}
{"text":"I tried the buffet here lastnight and it was absolutely repulsive. The ribs were dry, corn on the cobb tasted over cooked, and the entire hispanic section looked like dry dog food. My girlfriend and I both spit out the food in a napkin after realizing that the raw shrimp seemed to be luke warm.   We completely gave up and moved to dessert, what a mistake that was. I tried the chocolate cake and she had banana cream. The chocolate cake had no flavor, and the texture reminded me of rubber.   We paid about $34.00 for the two of us and regret every single penny. I will never return!"}
{"text":"We received a complimentary weekend stay courtesy of \"The Price Is Right\" for attending the taping of the \"Military Appreciation\" show.   The resort is very nice. Despite the fact we got a free stay, the staff are all incredibly friendly and professional. We drove in and I'm sure we looked a sight after a 6 hour car trip with a squalling baby. The valet acted no different than if we had come out of a limousine.   The lobby is beautiful just like everything else here. Check in was quick and easy. The room was spacious and the temperature just right. It smelled clean and the bed was spacious enough to accommodate us and our baby's sleeper in the middle of the bed.   The show stopper here was the pool/cabana/garden. It was almost completely deserted so we had it to ourselves. Gorgeous! This resort is away from the strip and was heavily populated by retirees so no drunk young guests.  I would call it family friendly.  Everything was easily in driving distance and room service was reasonable. When we come back we will definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"My fave for sportsbook, the pool, oyster bar, and local specials. So pretty too!"}
{"text":"This was my first time staying off the strip and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. It was nice to be away from the  hustle and bustle.   SPA: Let's start with the Spa. We happened to wander over to the fitness area to check it out and unexpectedly we found the Spa. Too bad it was on our last day because once we found it, we spent the rest of that day relaxing in that area. The staff were all friendly and gave both my husband and I a tour of the facility. We had lunch and drinks on a day bed near the pool, occasionally dipped in the pool when it got warm and then moved over to the co-ed jacuzzi and relaxed and caught up on some reading. The whole vibe was so enjoyable.   Pool: The main pool has everything you look for. Plenty of cabana's surrounding the pool to relax in. There is also a 21+ area called the pond that shows old movies on Sunday evenings.   Rooms: The room we had was fairly basic (King bed, flat screen TV, fridge, etc.) but I know they have upgrade options, so I might have to look into that next time. Plus our view was the parking lot but when in vegas who sits in their room and stares out the window.   Bingo/ Tables: Kerry in the bingo hall goes above and beyond to make you feel special. She was such a sweetheart and I hope she's still there the next time i go back. Tip she gave me: ask the bartender in the bingo area for her house special \"cash ball.\" Michael, Doug (dealers) and TN (pit boss) were so friendly. We took over the 3 card table for a couple hours and had so much fun!   Drinks: Things to note: they don't comp tito's vodka but they comp belvedere.   Restaurants in hotel were all very good. I will write separate reviews for them.   Bonus: The shops at The District has my favorite store, ANTHROPOLOGIE! A little small but a nice option."}
{"text":"I was recommended to go here by a good friend that knows I love to eat, so she recommended the seafood buffet! I hate buffets; but she said I would Not be disappointed and she was right!!! The buffet is only on Friday's so be prepared to get there when it first open, or stand in the amusement park line for 2 hours. My feet hurt like hell; but it was definitely worth it! Most buffets have cold crab; not here! They season it with a variety of Flavors to your temperature. I even had them season my shrimp. Which was perfect b/c the shrimp was de-veined and easy to peel! I wish I could've eaten more...Folks had their plates stacked with crab like it was the last supper!"}
{"text":"New slogan: GVR Hates Locals!  I won't be bringing my out of town visitors here ever again and I'll probably never come back myself. During midday on a weekday, the pool and hot tub were both extremely crowded and overrun by children. The service at the cabana was awful. The drinks were so watered down that my coconut water tasted like tap water. The waitress was totally inattentive and barely came over. There were dirty cups and dishes everywhere.   I came here as a local several times in 2013 and I had no problems with service. This is not the relaxing and quiet sanctuary I remembered from past visits. It is a beautiful place but not worth the awful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stayed here for three days in July for Cake Camp, a conference and workshop for cake decorating business.  I was very impressed by the decor and design of the lobby and the public areas: very posh, but not too glitzy and overwhelmingly 'vegas'.  I was upgraded to a 'pool view' room which happened to be ADD accessible.   The room was decorated nicely and had upscale finishes, but there was a definite lack of attention to detail.  The lamp on the desk had a very bent shade, the towel/robe hooks in the bathroom were all crooked, my message light on my phone blinked all the time, walls were thin and there was a very pissed off little dog a few doors down, the TV remote wasn't much help, the phone only called the front desk,  the key card reader to the hotel from the nearest entry point in the casino didn't work so I had to go around and about to the lobby and back up to the tower to access my room, and there was no in room book of services or restaurants. When i called down to inquire, he said that it was being redesigned. He gave me a run down of the restaurants in the hotel/casino, but really how was I going to remember a list of 12 places? There was a set of brochures for the spa and room service, but not even a CVB town guide or a hotel map.  (i did call down to mention the damaged light so I wouldn't get charged, and was told maintenance would replace it. never happened).   The meeting rooms were overall nice and the banquet food was good plus the $10/glass of house wine made it taste all the better (seriously, how do they get away with that markup!).  The pool looked nice, but I didn't have time to visit. And with a 7 p.m. close except for the tiny hot tub (so i heard, didn't see it on a map), it seemed a bit unreasonable--especially considering night swimming is the most comfortable option for July in the desert.   And I wonder if I am the only one who visits from out of town who is a bit confused by the \"We LOVE Locals\" campaign going on through the entire hotel. Yeah, I came 500 miles to stay here for a conference, sure glad you 'heart' locals the best!"}
{"text":"Wow a day at the spa. The massage therapist Thresa ---oh my goodness sooo amazing. I do massage for a living in California and she gets a five star. Incredible. All the girls employees were so wonderful-Sylvia, Lindsey, Mika were so helpful and so nice. Great job girls. Went in the lap pool and did laps, jacuzzi, hot steam sauna. Excellent! Highly recommend this resort  and so very clean the facility. Thanku-you."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday last year. The martinis are amazing!!!! The food was ok. The price for the food, I would have expected it to be better than it was. I hands down would recommend the dirty martini. The stuffed olives are amazing!"}
{"text":"Really nice little area off the strip to dine, drink and gamble. You can avoid the hustle and bustle of the large casinos and enjoy a more conservative approach. Pizza joints and healthy food joints bring different people out here. It's like an outdoor mall with an indoor casino."}
{"text":"I do really enjoy coming year. The rooms are always playing great eating and shopping. The movie theater doesn't hurt. You only problem I've ever had was getting a drink from a cocktail waitresses. I said something to one of them once about the long wait. She replied because it was she had two stations that Evening. I know how rough that could because  I have friends who are also cocktail waitresses."}
{"text":"My favorite resort and spa. The spa is the best for locals and the pool is amazing too!"}
{"text":"We stayed at GVR; only because we had our dog with us - GVR accepts pets, albeit with a $100 per stay charge.    You've read all of the cons about cab rides to the strip being expensive, lack of excitement, etc that are all true - but these may also be good things depending on the type of Vegas you're looking for.  Hey, if you're looking to hook up, people watch, or tear it up every night then GVR isn't the place for you.  If you're looking for a relaxing get-away in a serene environment with a great pool & spa, then do consider GVR.  My wife and I go to Vegas at least four times per year (staying at strip hotels) and really liked the laid back off-strip concept.  The restaurants were good, the spa excellent, and overall about 30% cheaper than similar strip offerings.   Oh, and our dog had a great time too.  Lots of places to go for walks, and they have a dedicated doggy-do area too.  This was a VERY different Vegas vacation for us - but we really liked it."}
{"text":"First came here for a few days recovering from back surgery one year ago. The pool was perfect for me. Easy access, the price (comps) was right, the time was perfect. Now we're back a year later and we think it is even better than before!"}
{"text":"This is a locals casino, lots if action slow beverage service but tip em and they be around often. Lived out here for 10 yrs and Stations is a locals place. Cheap but good food reasonable perks with gaming"}
{"text":"This is a review of the casino not the hotel.  It's spacious and well maintained.   Having visited other Stations Casinos over the years, this property is probably the nicest in my opinion.  It was well thought of in terms of layout and design. You don't feel cramped when playing or even while walking around the property.  The tables and machines are clean not cigarette burns that I noticed. The trash bins weren't full, which means they have enough staff/porters.  The only thing I encountered was a down roulette machine which needed attention. A crew came out and tried to work on it and was accompanied with a floor manager. Also, the pit bosses were unable to keep track of play as their base computer was also down. Weird as a $1.4 million payout had just happened the previous night on the Buffalo Machine.   The restroom I went to was clean and bright. I felt safe on this property.  I would probably come back again. It's off the strip but worth the visit.   I probably earned a comped stay based on my play.   See you in a few weeks!"}
{"text":"I have no real complaints. Really clean. Responsive housekeeping staff. I had a problem with their light switches... had to call for assistance with a high tech switch as it would not easily respond to my touch. Otherwise the stay was great. Loved their soap and bathrobes."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to GVR to gamble. It's my local casino and the staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is very welcoming. The reason for my less than perfect review is based on my experience at the buffet. The food was okay, but that wasn't the reason I was disappointed. As soon as I sat the waitress took my drink order, a glass of water. I'm not sure what exotic body of water she was fetching it from, but it never came. When I asked another waitress after waiting 30 minutes, she expressed her enthusiasm of not helping me. Just to recap I will return to GVR, but will eat at many of fine places along the district."}
{"text":"Green Valley.....almost perfect....almost paradise.  Went for spring break, just for some weeknight gaming.... Clean, comfy, relaxing, friendly, TONS of VP Machines.... cocktail waitresses not the prettiest, but always comes around like clockwork.....  Dropped over a K in 2 nights......come now....looosen up those machines....."}
{"text":"WORST STAY EVER!!! The only reason why I'm giving this place even a star is because my bedsheets were clean. I booked the hotel as a last hoorah before the kids went back to school. We woke up to no power, no internet, our TV blew a fuse and started smoking, and then our freezer was leaking. I went to the front desk, they said the power outage was out of our control(not a problem) and they would fix it as soon as they could. I had to work and upload information to my site while I was here, (which I was unable to due to the fact the internet wasn't working) I tried to make the best of it. My husband said he requested To speak with the manager, but conveniently he was in a meeting and promised to contact him When he was done. We spent the entire next day at the pool, not one phone call... And just came back to no television because the fuse that blew has still not been fixed. Can't wait to take a photo of that one! Ross was the manager. Gehrig was the loser front desk that \" was taking note.\" I never write horrible reviews. EVER! This one is one for the books! Shame on you GVR!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"AVOID!!!  AVOID!!!  AVOID!!!     WORST CASINO IN NEVADA!!!      0 stars!!!  Horrible gaming---Horrible customer service!    My friends, family and I will NEVER play/stay there again.  I tried to play a game of blackjack there.  I sat down one spot next to 1st base.  My father was already sitting at 1st base.    There was a lady at 3rd base---as soon as we sat down, she said that bad luck had just entered the table.    She proceeded to lose the next 2 hands, and blamed my father.    A couple hands later, I was able to play (I sat down a minute after my father, but missed the beginning of the shoe).  Not much happened after a few hands, and then there was dealer change--to Alberto.  I played a hand or two with Alberto, then was dealt a 16 with an 8 showing.    Typically, I play by the book; however, when a 16 vs 8 came up, I wanted to get the table's opinion.  The lady at 3rd immediately snapped:  if you have to ask what to do, you shouldn't be here.  OK, whatever.  She proceeded to lose the next 2 or 3 more hands, while my father was winning.  Pissed off, she left muttering some words about us.  I thanked God the bitch left.  Alberto the dealer said to me:  hey, don't call her a bitch--she's just calling it like she sees it.    I was just trying to get the opinion of the table--I know how to play 16's vs an 8.  Besides Alberto--who asked you?  I didn't ask for your opinion, so don't say anything more and deal the cards.  Alberto threatened to kick me out, then called the pit boss over.  So, let me get this straight, she's nasty and mean to me and my father since we sat down, get blamed for her losses, and when I try to ask for her opinion, she snaps back with a nasty comment.  So, I call her a bitch--yet I'm the one that gets in trouble?  We left after 10 minutes and went to another of the 1000's of casinos in the area.  Why even bother with this post?   Because Green Valley Ranch  -doesn't treat everyone the same,  -has extremely bad customer service,  -and hires people like Alberto --taking my statement completely out of context, offering his unasked for opinion, and threatening to kick me out.    I can't believe this place is rated like this--this place is a dump--we only went there because it was in between the people we were meeting.  Needless to say, I will NEVER go back--who wants this kind of action (with the lady) with this kind of dealer who takes things out of context, when there are 1000's of casinos in the area?  Just wanted to share my experience."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but couldn't. We wanted to relax at a pool and didn't realize it was Memorial Day weekend when we booked, so we ended up here, far away from the crazy Strip!  Firstly, my taxi dropped me off at the casino. You must walk about a mile to the lobby and it's incredibly confusing. Most taxis have a hard time picking up and dropping off here. It's really stupid the layout. It causes so much wasted time and headache and confusion.   Secondly, the food is crap. We asked to see the buffet and quickly walked out. The salad looked awful. They wanted $40 to eat garbage. No thanks. We took an Uber to Served to try a local brunch and it was great! Avoid the food here at Green Valley.   Thirdly, the Starbucks in the lobby is painfully slow. We waited 15 minutes to order and gave up.  Fourthly, our main purpose for this trip was pool relaxation. We arrived at the pool and nobody was there to give us towels or help us. We finally found a place to sit and then the wind picked up, knocking an umbrella over and it hit a woman in the head. Fire department came and took her out in a stretcher. Wind stopped but they made us all close our umbrellas. That was MISERABLE in the sun all day. It cut our pool day very short.  Fifthly, the girls who work the pool as waitresses are some of the biggest bitches I've ever met. We wanted to ask a girl about the reserved seats and she couldn't be bothered. In fact, she said she'd be right back to speak to us but never did, so we never rented the $100 seats. Glad we didn't because they had to close their umbrellas too. Poor service from Nevada girls that looks like burnt toast.  Sixthly, the walls in our room were PAPER THIN. I mean, I could hear the lady next door talking in her normal voice. Around 6 AM I had to knock on her door to ask her to be quiet. She apologized but wow, we could hear EVERYTHING. I did not get good rest there at all.  Overall I find it hard to say this place is a \"resort\". It was more like a glorified Motel 6.  Pros: pretty driveway and plants. Great valet guys. Lobby service is helpful and friendly. Pool looks pretty. Vineyard garden is pretty.  Cons: paper thin walls. Pool full of children. rude ass pool waitresses who lie and hate girls that are prettier than them. $14 mojitos in a tiny plastic cup. $8 Heineken 12 ounce cans. Pool umbrellas can't be opened when they send someone to the hospital. Sunburns. Casino is a maze with no exit to street (be warned). Taxis can sometimes take forever. Starbucks in lobby is slow as mud. Buffet food is of poor quality."}
{"text":"Gorgeous local casino! Probably one of my favorites.   Rooms are spacious, bright and clean. Huge bathrooms so thats a plus!  Tons of Amenities. Spa, pool, restaurants...  The pool..love it! Its not tiny like some lol casinos. It has a beach side sand entry. Fun for the kids! They also have an adult pool if your traveling without kids.  The district is right outside the casino so that allows for shopping and some extra spots to eat.    Super cute area!!!"}
{"text":"We had some flooding in our room via the next door neighbors so we asked to get moved to another room.  Luck for me and my wife they were sold out and they had to bump us up to a high rollers suite.  OMG this suite had two rooms and two bathrooms.  Had an outdoor patio.  Huge flat screen TV.  They said they hardly have anyone in this room and I couldn't imagine how much it would have cost. They have an excellent spa.  We both got a massage.  It was fabulous. The casino is cheaper than the strip so I gambled there then we took the shuttle to the strip to see a few shows.  The downfall was it only drops you off at the end of the strip so we had to hike a bit to get to the show. A little hint.  If you are a Coke fan and can't stand Pepsi (like my wife) there is a theater within the resort you can get a large Coke there.   We peeked in the adult only pool.   There were a few elderly people there so we didn't walk in."}
{"text":"I recently spent 3 days here on a quick trip to Vegas. I wanted to stay on the strip but a conference was being held at Green Valley Ranch which we were attending, so I didn't have a choice. My overall impression of the place was positive. Very clean and beautiful exterior, friendly and helpful staff, nice grounds and pools about the place.  When I first arrived I wanted to upgrade from a standard double queen bed room to a suite. I was told that would be no problem, and I even signed an updated \"contract\" (or something) guaranteeing me the room. The next day, when I was supposed to change rooms, they called me and said due to a poker tournament, there were no suites available at all. Despite my signed paper and guarantee of the suite being available. Now this place is huge, absolutely huge, there must be at least a thousand rooms - I know all hotels and resorts keep a certain number of suites available for \"special reasons.\" I was not happy about this.   Apart from the suite blunder, I had a good experience here. The rooms were spacious, clean and well-lit. Old tube-style TVs (not flat panels) and a lack of a fridge that was capable of staying cold however put a damper on things. Beds were thankfully comfortable. At times, the over-21 pool would be blaring rap music which was obnoxiously loud, but I can look past it. Self parking is quite far from the hotel which somewhat forces people to utilize the valet - free, but you've gotta tip.  I would say this is a decent place to stay if you're looking to save some money and sleep off of the strip. It's about a 15 minute drive to the strip via I-215, and because it is not confined to the limited space of the strip, the resort is sprawling and does not feel boxed in (like many of the strip resorts). I'd stay here again."}
{"text":"I love this spa! The 2 attendants that's checked me in were very friendly. The 2 attendants and he bottom of the stairs were very friendly but they didn't tell me exactly where to go. The amenities are wonderful! I love the hot tub waterfall in the women's lounge although There were towels everywhere on the floor. I wanted to try the eucalyptus steam room but it did not smell very good or eucalyptus-y. I skipped it and enjoyed the steam room. Tina was my technician and she was divine! The epitome of hospitable service!"}
{"text":"It might not b as exciting as bellagio aria or the Venetian but this is a solid hotel casino with great restaurants and a nice theater.  It's always clean and maintained. The spa and pool are  next to a vinyard. The district, located next to GVR has many more restaurants and stores."}
{"text":"We love GVR!  We are locals and visit either GVR or the M on occasion.  These are the places we take guests and suggest they stay if they are not staying with us.  Always good reviews.  I agree that the M usually has some sort of convention going on and that drives up the room rates and also fills up the table games.  Disappointing.  However, no matter what's going on at GVR they are on top of it.  The staff is great! They have the best/friendliest dealers in town, well, maybe other than The 4 Queens.  We usually have a great time here!  The buffet is ok.  Not great for the money.  The M is much better food and food quality.  However, The Grand Cafe is a GREAT option!  Wonderful food and great service at great prices.  We usually just go there.  Table games are great and there are plenty of options.  The reason they don't get 5 stars is that's very tough to get drink service while playing slots.  Very slow and not attentive, also the $25 \"resort fee\" is a stinker.  Just tell me what the price is and quit adding stuff.  Not cool.  Overall, you'll have fun here."}
{"text":"GVR is simply amazing in every aspect. The property is high class and you feel like you're in this majestic palace every time you're here. The rooms are fantastic, spacious and comfortable. Everything on property is immaculately clean also. Look at the floors shine!"}
{"text":"Bait and Switch.  I suffered an illegal tactic here.  i was offered a nicer room at a slightly higher charge than the original room I was getting.  When I left the hotel they added the old room charge with the new room charge and doubled the bill.  The manager Ross Crane could not be reached or bothered to come out of his office.  Since they failed to post any room rate information on the back of the room door (as required by law), I now get to sue them for triple the amount.  These idiots sent the debt to a collection agency because I refused to pay the bait and switch demand.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL"}
{"text":"I have not been back here for awhile but I was in the area and figured I would try it out. Mistake...  Horrible horrible horrible....once again servers walk right past me. Or they are running through so fast that they don't even give me a chance to flag them down.   What is the deal with getting drinks while you are spending money like they used to???   I might as well go to tribal casinos where I have to pay for drinks because that way I wouldn't feel so bad for complaining but it's seriously ridiculous. Servers are pointless. Why do they have them if they seem to pick and choose who they give drinks to. I spend quite a bit of money in stations casinos so if it's because they think I'm not spending enough...how do they know??   So, I use my card to check the perks at the kiosk. There was a guy using one in front of me. Something seemed to go wrong because it cut his sessions short and then the card wouldn't work. He tried several times but left. Then, the same thing happened to me. While trying to access the multiplier, it cut out and my card wouldn't work. So, I head to walk all the way to the players card desk.   First problem, some guy cuts right in front of me and not one employee stopped him. They helped him. I saw he was president but so am I. Not cool. Then, the guy that finally did help me had a really bad attitude and his manager MICHAEL was standing right there and did nothing. The employee was telling me I had to enter a pin code But I didn't want to. So, I asked him if he was making me change my code or just to enter to verify. He got upset and threw up his hands like I was supposed to know what the heck was going on. He repeated to me again to enter my pin and again I asked him if I was supposed to enter a new one or my old one and the gut couldn't answer. It was really frustrating to ME but the guy was acting like I'm the one bothering him!!?? And still, Michael the manager, was standing right there and did nothing. So, I actually stepped aside and asked him to assist because I was confused and my patience was running out with this guys attitude.   I still don't even know what happened but I guess I changed my pin...no one told me why or anything.   This is what makes me not want to spend any money in casinos. I'm already losing my money, So, can you at least talk with a smile and do your Damn job when it's needed?? I really don't appreciate bad attitudes towards me when I'm the customer or for any reason, for that matter."}
{"text":"Went to have dinner at the buffet and GVR raised their prices once again and now it is way too expensive for a buffet! Much better at Wicked Spoon over at Cosmo for around the same price for a more gourmet experience and way better desserts! Even Ceasars is much better for same price! The staff are nice at the buffet but the Sea Food wasn't worth the $29.99. GVR management should rethink  how they run GVR. The once nice hotel is failing fast. Needs updated design and better management. Casino has plenty of games that do not pay which makes the experience that much worse!"}
{"text":"I don't understand some of these less than stellar reviews below... I've always had a fantastic time at GVR. I've stayed here many times and am impressed every time.   GVR is a resort hotel in Henderson, a suburb of Las Vegas. Unless I'm going to Vegas to rock the Strip until 5am with friends, I'd much rather be here. The rooms are beautiful, spacious, and well-appointed. The bathrooms especially are really lovely and large.   The service is superb; you can call housekeeping and ask for anything and it will be there within 15 minutes. There's also an in-house movie theatre.  The restaurants are fantastic; Terra Verde and Sushi + Sake are some of my faves. The Grand Cafe is an easy choice for a casual meal any time of day and the Feast is a fine choice for your classic Vegas buffet.  The pool area is my favorite - there's a sandy beach walk in area for the kids, a shallow lounge chair area for the drinkers, and a lap pool for the swimmers. The waitresses are friendly and never too far away. The music is energetic and loud enough. They also have PLENTY of umbrellas, so you don't have to bake if you don't want to.  The spa is lovely. I've used it about 5 times and each time, it's the same. Lovely. There is a well-stocked locker room with all the toiletries you would need (and you can request others). The treatment waiting room is stocked with water, fruit, nuts, and really good teas. The treatment rooms themselves are a good size with low lights and soothing music. After many (if not all) of the treatments, you're given the opportunity to shower in a fantastic waterfall rock shower with about 10 jets. I always leave feeling happy and relaxed.  The hotel is also right next to The District, an outdoor promenade and shopping area. When it's hot, they have misters, and there's a nice mix of shops and restaurants there. In the evenings, there's music and a kids play area. It's also very dog-friendly with designated doggie bathrooms.   This is my go to hotel for a relaxing Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Great hotel! I love the rooms, the nature themes, the fun sand pool, dining outdoors... This place is seriously nice. Unfortunately, its REALLY far from the strip. Like $40 each way kind of far. Which realistically does not fly for anyone who actually wants to party in Vegas and hopes to hook up. I like to stay where the action is and this place is absolutely dead in the evenings.   I did the whole spa treatment here too-- my massage was heaven. There was good shopping in the area too. Again, for gluttons who want to get away.   If you want to go to Vegas but reject the whole concept of the strip, try Green Valley. It's pretty sweet. If you have a pulse however, you may want to opt for something else."}
{"text":"Great off the strip place to stay at. Rooms are quiet, spacious, comfy and very reasonably priced although you'll want to note that they tack on a $25/day for resort hotel fee. Guessing it's for the \"free\" wireless, pool use etc??  Awesome pool and really regal looking property. The pool beds are so comfy and nice to sunbath on.   The staff- so so. A mix of jaded and hard workers. Last time I was here I got lost trying to find my room (the layout is really weird and kinda annoying) I asked a worker they pretended to know and pointed me in the completely wrong direction. This time I asked a housekeeper member a basic question about towels at the pool \"I don't know, never been there\".  Casino is nice enough. Though as another reviewer wrote \"casino is tight\" so are the tables. They haven't treated me so nice (yes, I'm on day two of three at the hotel still). I'm hoping it will change around. If not the I'll be at the Palms on day 4. Yes, yes I jump around alot in Vegas.  The Sushi place is A-ok. A lil overprice, not exciting or very good quality sushi. I got a thing against sushi being served anything but slightly chilled.   The Pancake House, YUM! Great breakfast and lunch items for regular prices. Anything you want breakfastwise. Including some new stuff like Bacon Waffles or Pancakes. Not my thing but a friend of mines says they're bomb.  NEWAYS...I prob should go enjoy the premises. I guess Yelp has become serious part of my life...uh oh!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, newer, clean, located in the swanky \"District\" area great for shopping. Large parking lot. Perfect for getting away from the madness of the strip but still feeling like you are in Vegas! Hit and miss on the staff - wonderful hosts, some terribly sour waitresses. Games not too tight, had a great time. Some good eats there from the lower end Panda Express food court type stuff to a higher end steakhouse. High limits bar a good one, lots of machines and a lot of smoke, ugh! No getting around that in Vegas though. Similar to Red Rock casino - I think, same owners. Worth a drive to Henderson for sure!"}
{"text":"We were here for a whole day at the pool and we were treated like VIPs with the utmost respect! Our server her name is Danielle she was Fan-Tastic!! This is a resort not a hotel. THAT is where people mess up. IT'S called a resort for a reason you go there you get treated as though your VIP everywhere you go. Don't be mad if you lose while you're gambling. That's part of gambling we took our grand children there to go swimming and we had such a wonderful day I can't thank you all enough! Sincerely, Kim"}
{"text":"I don't live too far from this establishment and so as a local I do frequent this casino more then I do any other station casinos. If I can give any one advice it is to definitely get a players card and use it if you play. They mail free rooms, free bets, and free meals each month. Recently I received a free $75 bet each week for the entire month of July. So far I've won 1 time out of the three times but I will only use it if I'm in the area and I don't play more then the bet as I know that it is a way for them to lure you in and get you to play so much more and lose so much more so really $75 is nothing to them when you wind up losing more then that. Now with the free room coupon...Book it as soon as you receive it because they go FAST and it is only good for Sunday thru Thursday. Unfortunately I wasn't able to use mine because they were all booked for the dates selected. As for the rooms, although it is comped, it is worth it. Very clean, spacious, and doesn't give you a feeling of roaches dancing in the dark...so I'm sure the non-comped rooms are even better.   The pool gets a new paragraph because it is by far one of the best pools. It is half beach and half pool so it is fun for the kids because of the sand. I warn you that it gets extremely HOT during the summer so your children feetsies WILL burn so have them wear water shoes so they can enjoy it. There is also a wading section that is under a bridge so if you want shade during those HOT months then you got it. You can even put a chair in the water for relaxation. To use the pool it is free if you're a guest and you just have to show your room key; however $20 if you're just visiting. They're no too strict on this as we've managed to slip by without anyone charging...again, bring your room key (Hint Hint).   As for the Feast Buffet, it is decent. They used to have crab legs but they got rid of it a few months ago and just lowered their buffet prices. I'm thinking since they have a seafood restaurant in the casino, they were not making money because everyone was just going to the buffet. There is a nice lady that goes by \"Mama\" who used to saute the crab legs with garlic, tomatoes and some secret spice then she would ask how spicy you want it and boy were they yummy. She would always have a line and I remember waiting at least half an hour just so she could saute my crab legs...but worth the wait. Since they don't have crab legs you can still go to her and ask her to saute the shrimp from the shrimp cocktail bar. (don't forget to tip her)   As for bars, i like going to the sports book bar, play a little poker and get free drinks. My bar tender of choice is \"Tyler\". He's created my favorite Mai Tai drink with a twist...just ask him for his famous mai tai and he'll know what you're talking about."}
{"text":"This resort has a beautiful grounds and atmosphere, however, I give them 3 stars for two reasons: 1)  because of their outrageous resort fee of around $25.00.  2)  during our stay, a family member needed a wheelchair as they were not feeling well. The hotel was only willing to accomodate and provide the wheelchair if we gave them our drivers license for the entire day. Since I didn't feel comfortable giving them custody of our driver's license, I asked if they could just make a photocopy and keep that--they refused.  After speaking to several managers, we were told the wheelchairs belongs to the security company, and that it was THEIR policy to keep the drivers license. The hotel said there was nothing they could do to run interference with their security company.  Even though this was not Green Valley's policy, they are complicit with their security's policy and make it difficult for handicap people to get the aid they need.  We will not be staying here again. Simple as that."}
{"text":"We were upgraded (gratis) to a grand suite! Holy shit balls! I felt like I was on an episode of cribs! Beautiful room. I was the princess of the valley!!! Well, at least until check out!  I LOVE this place. If I run away from home - you will know where to find me. I love the relaxed atmosphere of the GVR. Quite lobby, semi-quite casino (not sure if that is good) Workers all seemed happy - their smiles didn't look forced. Beautiful decor. Beds - AMAZING! Towels - good. Water pressure - excellent. Jacuzzi tub...we bonded... Shower stall size - small. Not to mention someone forgot to install bathroom vents! What's up with that? Slots - the goddess of gambling was not in a good mood during our stay. Make sure you have a car - cab fare is about 30 bucks to the strip."}
{"text":"Really horrible service. Like other reviewers, I was at this hotel for a conference. The check-in process was horrible--waited 30 minutes in a huge line and it was chaos. My two friends had booked a room with two beds. Instead, they were given a weird \"Austin Powers\" room with one bed and shag carpet, and no apologies or promises to make it right form the staff. This property seems completely mismanaged. The food is also mediocre and boring. Lacking in accessible coffee in the morning and ATMs (on purpose?). The shuttle bus at the strip drove right past us and the staff was rude when I called and asked the shuttle to come back and pick us up from the strip. Also, interactions with the staff...some seem pretty \"off\" and colorful. Wifi was a joke. Would not stay here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here about once a year for many years.  I like the relative quiet of being away from the strip in a self-contained resort.  It's a much easier drive from LA and avoids all the traffic of the strip.  My wife likes the adjacent shopping promenade that gives it an extra dimension.     Some people have complained that you have to do a lot of walking from the parking lot to your room to the casino, etc., but once you've been here a few times you get more efficient and know where to park and where to request a room (hint, staying in the West Tower will save you a lot of steps).    Rooms are comfortable, maybe a little dark. No longer do the guest rooms have coffee makers, but the coffee in the lobby is excellent.  Just get there before 9:00 am.  The casino is pretty spread out and has a lot of machines.  We like slots, but only the old fashioned spinning reels, not the pretty penny picture games.  Unfortunately, the trend tends to be to replace the old with the new, so there are a very limited number of slot machines that we like to play, and this is sad.  There are a lot of video poker machines as well.  The crowd in the casino is a mix of guests and locals, mostly locals, and it's a pretty friendly crowd.   We like the pool, my wife can spend the entire day there.  Water temperature is just like returning to the womb (I'm guessing).  Food at the pool restaurant is unbelievably good and has gotten better than it was.  I'm a little confused about their policy towards locals after reading another review from a spurned local.  When we were there early this week, the place was packed with locals, who seem to meet there each afternoon to party in the pool and make some noise.  This was annoying.  NIce spa, which we didn't use, and excellent fitness center, which we did.  There is a lap pool in the spa.  Food in the casino offers a lot of choices from the food court to the buffet to some high end restaurants.  I'll eat at the buffet if there is little or no line and I'm hungry.  Maybe a late breakfast there and go to a good place for dinner.  We had dinner at the buffet the day we arrived.  It's standard buffet fare, which some people really eat up. Our best meal was at Hank's (steakhouse), and it was truly memorable.  We will make it a point to visit Hank's on all future visits to GVR."}
{"text":"I played over 12 hours of poker here with the locals and it honestly beats any place on the strip. The room's aren't cheap, but definitely one of the nicer room's I've ever stayed in, especially at a casino. As a bonus there are a couple late night bars/clubs AND Fatburger is located seconds away from the poker room (and is open 24 hours)..."}
{"text":"Hanks is amazing! I'm not a huge fan of going to the strip this is my go to to for date out any other local restaurant. My filet is always cooked perfect! I'm a creature of habit so I always get the same things, a few recommendations- the shellfish platter, tuna poke, cream corn, Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and the lobster chowder is killer. I get it every time! Hanks is so delicious I can't wait to go back. Side note- I'm big on customer service especially when dining at a formal restaurant and the staff here is always great"}
{"text":"LOVED this place. The hotel was gorgeous and every aspect was just great...check-in, the room, view, the pool. Got it for a great price (there's a resort fee...boo) so if I could book it again for $60ish/night I'd definitely recommend it. I think I paid around $100 for the night after all fees were included. Just beautiful overall and would love to stay here again if I had the opportunity!"}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this hotel/casino!! I had a wonderful Memorial weekend here with my family and we all enjoyed it!  I think the only CON is trying to find valet but other than that here are my PRO's:  1) once u leave ur car at valet, all the workers there are SUPER welcoming!!!! They are all smiles & also open the entrance doors for you! The Valet drivers even offer you complimentary cold water when they bring you back your car!   2) They have starbucks at the lobby! Great for coffee lovers!  3) The hotel looks very luxurious! I love the interior designs!  4) The pool area is really nice! They have a beach club party on the weekends too until 4pm!  5) The beds are super comfy   6) Housekeeping is great!!! They brought my towels and sheets up super quick!   7) They let me use their mini fridge to keep my baby's milk cold (They dont charge you if you need to keep your medications cold & its $15 a night for personal use)  8) If you go eat at the buffet and sign up for a preferred card u get a huge discount! So worth it! Only paid like $15 for lunch! I also love the desserts they have at the buffet! Esp. Their ice cream 8)"}
{"text":"Front Desk Very Rude, and that was two of them. My sister was checking in at the same time. And remember they get you for the resort fee per night 28.00.   Room Very Clean Need extra Electric outlets NO COFFEE POT They say free WiFi.. didn't work Short on towels and to call.  Restaurants The worst service I have ever had in the Coffee shop. And the coffee tasted like Folger's (ugh).  Went to Starbucks in the food court, gave them my debut card with my picture on it, they wanted to see my ID. For one cup of coffee. I have never been ask by Starbuck for a photo ID when I have it on my BofA card. So I went over to the Coffee Shop and got the Folger's Coffee (ugh). Whats a girl going to do when she needs her coffee fix.  Pool  Wonderful warm and clean Order lunch, Club with Fries, sandwich was as hard as a rock and cold. Fries where cold. Diet Coke was ok. Closes very early, like 7pm. which is a shame, night time swimming is so nice.  They have an Adult pool, which I wish the drunk's would use it and not have foul mouths at the pool and slobbering actions. Maybe they got kick out of the Adult pool? Didn't like my grand kids to see that. Had to explain why the women kept falling in the pool drunk and her drunk friends had to help her.   My obinion of Green Valley Resort and Spa, that cost an arm and a leg.  They need to update there rooms Have their staff go to a class on how to treat customers Get a new Chef in the restaurants  Get another type of a Coffee Bar in the food court AND INSTEAD ALL THE CANDY IN THE ROOM PUT A COFFEE POT IN THE ROOM"}
{"text":"a great place for relaxation.  had a great new years eve party there!"}
{"text":"We stayed here one night, and the next day my husband and I found bed bug bites on various parts of our bodies. Our room was not super clean either. A thick blanket of dust on the furniture, hair in the sink, and an itenerary from a previous booking was found in the top drawer. For these reasons, I do not recommend this resort."}
{"text":"It seems like Green Valley is a world away from the Strip and you don't want to stay here if you're planning on enjoying all that the Strip has to offer, but if you are looking for a high quality destination resort, this is one of my favorite places in Las Vegas.  Kids can be happy here with lots of food court, movie theater type amenities to keep them interested and entertained, and adults can enjoy the casino, nice rooms and some really good restaurants.  I especially enjoyed Hank's where the steaks were first rate. Rooms are very nice as well, and really the only complaint I have other than the distance from the Strip and price of a cab ride to get out here is the hotel layout is confusing, not well marked and downright bizarre.   It's the only hotel I've really every been in where I found it difficult to find my room and get around, and there doesn't seem to ever be any staff in the halls to help guide you along your way.  There is also a nice variety of shops attached to the property, so shopping can be fun as well. They aren't really as nice as being at the Encore/Wynn with its Espanade, the Canal and Palazzo shops at Palazzo/Venetian and having Fashion Show Mall across the street, but it's still not bad.  Overall a nice, inexpensive place to stay and enjoy a trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Hotel is nice but there are some annoyances. Signs for parking are stupid and are misleading. Parking garages are not close to the rooms. I requested a room close to the elevator but got put at the end of a hall (difficult for someone with foot problems)."}
{"text":"This was the perfect place to stay during my business trip in August.  The best part of my stay was Cherry, the mat Pilates instructor over at the fitness center.  I assumed it would be cake, but she really pushed me and I got in a great workout!  Cherry was extra nice, outgoing and accommodating.  Thanks Cherry! :)  The rest of the staff were also very courteous and helpful.   Rooms were large, clean and well appointed.  I ate at several restaurants in the casino, and found the \"Grand Cafe\" to be the most consistent.  To be honest, the food was pretty mediocre and my advice would to be stay in the $13-18 price range to avoid being disappointed.  Still, the dining options and quality did seem on par to what I'd expect from an off-strip Vegas hotel.  When I checked in I did have some issues with my room.  They booked me into a \"smoking optional\" (quite the doublespeak!) room, so i asked to have the room changed.   The next room  had problems with the HVAC.  They were fully booked, so I ended up with a smoking room anyway.  It's amazing how the smoke smell that's in the carpet and wallpaper still seem to get into the towels and even your clothing.   Still, it didn't ruin my trip.  I'd totally stay here again."}
{"text":"Beautiful and Has fun with my parents playing blackjack for my birthday. This is a regular stay for my parents and famiky.. Very clean beautiful rooms and friendly staff..  could have better food selection  but other than that. This place is classy and off the strip and the D ONT charge for parking! Very classy! Thanks for Making my birthday AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"First time staying at Green Valley Ranch.  I enjoyed my stay and would be happy to return.   LOCATION * About 10 minutes from the south part of the strip without traffic. * Adjacent to The District shops and restaurants, which is nice.   ROOM I stayed in a \"Superior King\" room in the East Tower.  It's clean and comfortable, though not as large as other \"entry level\" rooms I've stayed in around town.  There's a desk, a lounging chair and ottoman, two side tables (one with a Bose stereo), and a mini-bar which is really just a tray with a few items on it.  No refrigerator in the room.  (I mention this because if you have medications that require refrigeration, you'll have to keep refilling the ice bucket.)  The bathroom is quite nice: large and clean with a separate large tub from a walk-in shower.  There is also a free-use safe in the closet.  Note: there is apparently free wi-fi in the room.  It never worked for me, and it never worked for friends in a different room.  I called the help desk; they walked me through some steps to try to get it to work, but it never did.  Air conditioning worked great!  I wish electrical outlets were more accessible -- for phone chargers and such.  I had to unplug the stereo behind an end table to plug in my charger to have my phone near me.   CASINO Fine.  I visited from Sunday through Tuesday; the casino was never too crowded.  Casino staff is friendly.  I love playing Bingo; the Bingo room is very nice -- but the Bingo session is a little pricy for a very modest payout and quick (55 minute) session.   RESTAURANTS Many of the restaurants were closed for remodeling during my visit.  I did visit Hank's during happy hour, which is fantastic.  The Feast buffet at breakfast was great as well -- just $8 for a large selection.  The food court has Capriotti's subs, a pizza place, Fatburger, a frozen yogurt place, a Starbucks, and another place or two.  I did not visit the Grand Cafe, but I did purchase from their pastry counter.  Delicious.   POOL Beautiful.  Nice 21 and over side pool as well.  Varied seating areas, from traditional lounges to sofas and cabanas.  Great area -- even after the pool closes at 7 p.m.   SHOPS There are two very small gift shops in the hotel, but GVR's adjacency to the District shops and restaurants is awesome.  Note: the District is an outdoor mall, so during the summer it will be hot.     SPORTS BOOK, MOVIE THEATER, ARCADE, EVENTS CENTER Of these, I only visited the arcade (disappointing as a 40+ year old, but probably enjoyable for kids).   SERVICE Very friendly staff at every stop.   NUTSHELL I enjoyed it here.  I love the look, decor, location, service, and amenities.  I visited because of a Groupon deal, which was fantastic, so be on the lookout for those."}
{"text":"My very first time being able to gamble!!  This review is strictly for the casino. My grandma lives around here and I finally came to Vegas to start house hunting and she wanted to show us around LOL.  This casino is so nice and I didn't feel like we were in a boatload of cigarettes either! They must have good ventilation even though there were quite a few smokers it wasn't unbearable! Most casinos make you plug your nose from all of the smoking!  I mostly went for the penny slots and they had a huge selection! I'm happy to say I made my money back LOL! There was only one weird thing that happened while out on the floor. My mom and I were sitting next to each other at the machines and one female employee walked past me giving me a weird look and then a few minutes later a male employee asked us if we wanted to sign up for their rewards card, he did my mom's in two seconds but then when it came to my turn he took my ID somewhere and was gone for a bit, I'm not sure if I looked so young that they wanted to card me but it was random and awkward.   He should of just asked me flat out, and I wouldn't have had any problem showing my ID. There's a few other casinos my grandma wants to show me so I'm not sure if I'd come back on a basis."}
{"text":"Complete jerks. Asked to see my ID, told them it was in the room. They followed me like a criminal back to my room and when I showed them my ID they continued to 86 me from the property because they were embarrassed that they were wrong. They refused to give me a refund for my hotel costs and refused to let me collect my things from the room. I will smear campaign them like no ones been smeared before."}
{"text":"Nice place, the staff was very pleasant however they did not seem to be very knowledgeable of the facilities.  Even with their website directions it was very difficult to find the valet parking entrance.  Quite a hike from the rooms to the Casino which is on the second floor??.  The \"off strip\" room rates kind of compensate.  We did not go to the strip because it seemed like a lot of extra work to get there."}
{"text":"First off I get it, your pockets are not going to be affected by the loss of my presence but I've spent thousands of dollars at your casino. So today I won a bet on the KC game so I decided to treat myself to prime rib. I pay, tip the same amount as much check and then on my way out I grab a pastrie. I gave the lady $5.25 and then I walk away. I suddenly get stopped by the same lady in which she tells me that I still owe 18 cents. For taxes. I get it. So I go to pay and use my points. Which came out to 15 cents. So I am short 3 cents and all I have is $100 dollar bill. I see 3 cents on the register thinking the lady would gladly offer me the three cents. NO. She makes me break my $100 dollar bill for 3 cents when I just tipped the bar tender nearly $20 dollars. I live across the street and always place my bets at your casino. Even when I told the lady your willing to lose my business over three cents she laughed. So I will never step foot in your casino again. Over three cents."}
{"text":"Maybe if you end up coming here for a vacation with your own schedule, the place is perfect, but my main complaints are the offerings for the working professionals who have to attend busy days of conferences and seminars.   Some of the decor is very dated, but they are undergoing a very large and loud remodel... so maybe that will bring it up to 2016 standards.  There are several events going on here throughout the week in the many venues, conference centers and function areas. Concerts, business meetings, seminars, trade shows... So, after a busy day, wouldn't it be great to relax at the pool? NOPE! Closes at 5:00!!! WTF?! Why does the pool have MOM hours?! The same goes for their Red Rock location.   Have to attend a dinner after a hectic day and want to swing by the gym later to move around a little because you've been sitting and gorging for hours? It closes @ 7:00! Good luck running your ass across the compound and through their labyrinth of tunnels to get their before the door locks! :(  This place is a *part-time* resort. It has nice amenities, but if you're there for business, there's a slim chance you'll be able to use any of them.   The staff is very nice and accommodating (not saying they will open the pool for you after 5:00 pm or anything, but they can give you a spare lip balm if you ask nicely)."}
{"text":"We stayed here for a few nights for a conference. Got a Mediterranean Suite to share with 3 others. It was pretty nice.! Two separate king bedroom, living room, dining room and an outdoor patio with a fireplace. It was a great room!  The people there were all very friendly and helpful.  They had a great outdoor pool with a San box for the kids. Actually, this place seemed like a very family-friendly resort and casino."}
{"text":"Thank you Green Valley for making this stay such a great experience. You have definitely made up for our last stay. Kudos to you."}
{"text":"One, relatively huge problem.   One shuttle to get to the strip.  Leaves every 2 hours starting at noon.   You have to get a voucher 30 minutes prior to guarantee your spot or you're out of luck. Its a small shuttle. It's time consuming and not expected In a resort like this.  If this was a no frills cheap hotel like circus circus or the rio, I'd understand. But it's not and its a terrible system that needs overhaul.     If you plan to spend time on the strip, I would not recommend this hotel."}
{"text":"good place to lay your weary head if you do not want the hustle and bustle of  a regular casino hotel. nice huge pool area with zen type decor and bar. pricey...pricey ...pricey... not recommended for people who would like the strip traffic coz this place is far from it and would require a car. nice to experience once ."}
{"text":"Stayed here in early May 2016 for a girlfriends getaway.   The resort is expansive with beautiful landscaping. While undergoing several remodeling projects the areas are carefully hidden and there is very little noise or dust.   *Amenities: Several outdoor cabanas offer seating areas and there is a small outdoor fireplace. The fireplaces were on during the evenings but surrounded by smokers. The rooms are equipped with hair dryer, magnifying mirrors and plenty of towels. The bedding is comfortable and soft.   *Spa: The GVR spa and exercise room are excellent! The locker room area has robes and sandals and small keyed lockers. There are several vanities with hair dryers, curling irons and flat irons. Amenities such as tooth brushes, shampoo, lotion, razors and water are also available. Outside of the sauna are iced towels. Everything was clean and beautiful. There is also a co-ed area with an outdoor fireplace and seating area. The spa treatments are overpriced, however the service quality was excellent and the massage was well worth it. Going to the spa is well worth it even if you aren't getting a service. The exercise area has free weights, several treadmills, stationary bikes and elliptical machines. It overlooks the spa pool area. During one workout a couple was making out at the spa pool and the woman took off her bikini bottoms. Another man was laying out and looked like he had just taken Viagra and was rocking back and forth on his lawn chair.   *Food: Starbucks- Expect approximately $1 price hikes. The smokey casino smell did not affect the store area. The service was rude and unfriendly. Dukes- great happy hour with half price cocktails and appetizers. Had the espresso martini and it was awful. The espresso was burnt. The bar was a nice place to stand and we met several interesting people and had great conversation. There is live music and she was excellent!  Borracha is the brand new Mexican restaurant. It is excellent!!! They have an all you can eat taco Tuesday with wonderful margaritas and street tacos. Great service and atmosphere.   *Pool: There are several beautiful pools. The largest is a family friendly area with great seating and service.   *Parking: Uber friendly with 24-hour complimentary valet. I regret not being able to tip the amazing service. Bring cash!"}
{"text":"I have been to Vegas many many times, but I always experienced it as a 'tourist.' This was the first time I tried it as a 'local' and I'm not sure I will ever go back to being a tourist again.  Stayed Thurs - Sun at the GVR, which is located approximately 20 minutes from The Strip. For many people, the distance might be a turn-off. Let me assuage your concerns. It is not a big deal at all.  First, the pros: I booked travel vouchers through TravelZoo. Got the Thurs. night stay for $75 and Fri & Sat were $100 each. That included everything except a $25/day resort fee and the hotel tax. Did I mention it also included a $25/day resort credit? The resort fee includes internet and spa use, among other things. This is significant because many of the properties on The Strip charge you a resort fee and then an additional charge for spa or internet usage.  Then, thanks to a snafu which isn't worth mentioning except that the manager Diana took care of it really quickly, I got upgraded to an Executive Suite. That's 4 days/3 nights in a suite for $275. Try and beat that on The Strip.  Blessings to all of the valet guys (I remember Michael and Jayson but there were several others who were all great). A huge shout-out to the concierge who hooked me up with guest list access to Tryst on Thursday night and Marquee on Friday night. Thank you to pretty much everyone on the staff, from the front desk people to the clerks who opened the front door for me every time I left for my car, to the maids who cleaned the room. First rate service.  The property offers at least four separate pools, including an adults-only one called The Pond (which is great for when you don't want to be around kids) and a main pool which has a sandy beach area in it.  The Spa is first-rate, complete with flat-screen tv's in the hot tub area. Perfect for watching football and relaxing. There are a couple of bars on the property as well. Sports Book area offers $1 beers and $1 hot dogs on football game days. Are you effing kidding me?!  And I ate extremely well (they have a $25 all you can eat crab leg feast at one of the restaurants) with no buyer's remorse, because I had the $25/day resort credit, so everything was just cheaper.  Sure, GVR tries to 'sex' things up a bit by having a Brazilian pool party - complete with bikini contest - on Sundays and they have bikini model servers in the Lobby Bar on Wednesday nights. But don't mistake this resort for a 'sexy' hotspot. It is, ultimately, a place to relax (or gamble, if that's your thing).  But again, getting your 'fix' of The Strip is no problem when it's such a short drive away. In fact, really my only gripe with GVR is that they still have the old tube tv's in the rooms. It's 2011. Time to replace them with flatscreens. And preferably with screens that are larger than 20\". Oh well, not a huge deal.  I was in town for a convention which was being held at The Palazzo (which I've stayed at before and adore, btw). Suite at The Palazzo - even with the 'convention special' was $260/night. So, in essence, I saved over $500 on lodging costs by staying at GVR. The savings paid for my night at Tryst, my night at Marquee, a fantastic dinner at Otto, my rental car and even my gas money to and from LA.   Like I said before, I'm seriously considering never staying at a property on The Strip again. If you're dead set on staying at a 'hot, happening' property, then this is not the place for you. But if you're traveling with a family or if you're open to trying something different, I would recommend giving GVR a try. I did and I don't regret a moment of my stay.  Trust me; I'm an Elite. ;)"}
{"text":"Took the GF here last weekend for her birthday. This is my new favorite place in Vegas. Not the party pool scene like some places in Vegas, but if you are looking to just relax it is great. Thanks to one of the previous Yelp reviewers for mentioning the pool at the fitness club. I don't think most guests realize this pool is even on the property. It is bigger, cleaner, no kids, and very quite with beds for louging. The also have drink and food service from the bar up here. The pool bar food was better than I expected. The steam room is also awesome. The main pool was too full of kids and loud. We went to the Pond one afternoon, and while it is very small, it is a pretty good place to post-up if you want to party.  Our room was very nice with a pool view...we received an upgrade since our room still wasn't ready. I love the casino here because it is never too crowded and not overly smokey. The table limits for Blackjack and Pai Gow is only $5. All the dealers were nice, as were the front desk folks.  Hank's Steak House also has a martini happy hour 7 days a week from 5 -7. Very good martinis. The strip is only a $30 cab ride, but everything you need is on property, or very close. We walked over to the Cheesecake Factory one night for dinner.   Befoer we even left the hotel we were looking for a good weekend to come back."}
{"text":"Be careful renting a cabana here. We called to reserve on on a holiday weekend, but they wouldn't take a payment over the phone, just said that they put us on the list to have a cabana. We called in the morning to let them know we were going to be there after 11am, GVR said ok no problem. We get there and they have no cabana available. They said they always overbook and give it to who's on the list...and suddenly they DON'T have our name down & said we never called to reserve anything. Super pissed.  They finally gave us a cabana after screwing us around, and when we went to pay our drink & food tab, they said we had to meet a $300 food tab. None of that was ever said to us to begin with and now they're trying to make us order $300 worth of food/drinks before we can go. WTH?  One of the guys came up to us and said \"that should've been told to you when you called and reserved the cabana\"...hi...according to you, we NEVER called...then the topper, when we finally get our bill settled once they realized we were not going to pay the $300 minimum, they run our cards incorrectly and add in that we bought sweatshirts. OMG. We will NEVERRRRRR come back again. Too many issues"}
{"text":"Thought for sure that Red Rock was my favorite off strip casino, but this place is equally good.  It's also equally just as far from the strip too.  Casino is large with many cheap tables and slots.  A shopping complex, called the District is just outside it's door.  Restaurants are good but not outstanding here.  Movie theaters and a food court is also in here.  Kind of a perfect spot for a family reunion get together in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm at a wedding right now doing this review I have to express my utmost disappointment with their catering Imagine being in a reception where half the guests are waiting for food STANDING watching half the guests enjoy their food This is my first negative review Sorry not sorry!"}
{"text":"I love staying at GVR. The hotel is absolutely stunning. It is clear that the designers really put the time in to make this place feel like a top notch resort. Every time I stay here I make sure to request a room with a pool view because it makes the experience so much more wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is under some sort of management change.  Used to play here a lot, like everyday. They added more Pai Gow tables, good move in my opinion as that table tends to fill up quick. Then they dropped the Progressive Jackpot from $100k to $12k.  That's a significant drop. I've been playing regularly for over 20 years and have never gotten the progressive pot before but to drop it down to $12k has just drew the line for me.  We will no longer be going there till they reverse their poor management decision."}
{"text":"Super nice property! Awesome pool, great restaurants, excellent workout facility with spa, plus great shopping next door. There's more than enough things to keep you busy here. Alot of amenities for the price and much more affordable than comparable properties on the Strip. I would give it a 5 but a non-smoking room is a bit of a misnomer. We had to change rooms twice before we truly had a non-smoking room (one that didn't reek of smoke). Rooms are super nice and the staff was vey helpful and accomodating. Overall would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I stayed at Green Valley for a sales conference that my company was hosting. It was a great venue for meetings. The food was good and the resort offered enough of a variety for us to meet in small groups when the time allowed. Great place!!"}
{"text":"Tons of penny slots w max bets of at least $2.   There is also a large No Smoking area - however, like every other casino I've been to, you have to walk thru the smoking area to get there... which makes no sense at all. Overall, every staff member I came across were very helpful cordial and friendly.   The best time to come - to avoid the crowd - is after midnight"}
{"text":"Green Valley is definitely a top favorite casino of mine. It's what I consider a locals hidden gem. The interior is beautiful, almost reminds me of the Titanic- a classic elegance feel. The buffet is the bomb, borracha is so good especially for taco Tuesday, and this only casino that I feel actually pays out well."}
{"text":"When my fried promised to take us to a cheap buffet off the strip I was expecting something kind of ghetto, but this place was actually really nice. From the outside it looks like a strip mall, but the inside is pretty.   This review is for the casino and the 13 dollar dinner buffet. The casino feels really new and doesn't reek as much of smoke as other casinos. The buy ins go as low a 5 bucks so I'm a fan. It's not as crowded and caters to an older crowd. Now, the buffet is AWESOME for the price of 13 bucks. (Make sure to sign up for a free players card first at the rewards center) My favorite was the seafood pasta, green beans, and carrot cake. But they have quite a bit of food. Our server was really friendly and I would come back here for the buffet alone.   I also learned how to play pai gow here and got a free lesson my Asian dealer who looked at me like I was nuts for playing when I had no idea how to play. I ended up losing but it's ok. ^.^ If you happen to bring any foreigners here, make SURE to bring passports otherwise, they will have to kick you out."}
{"text":"I've seen this place on a tv show so I was excited to check it out. Went and got a player card which took $5 off the buffet. The buffet wasn't that good. Shrimp had their tails so it created an extra step for me before I shoved them in my mouth, and they weren't tasty. All the employees appeared to hate their job. I waited a bit to get seated and there was no line. Even paying for the buffet I was behind someone but the register behind me was empty and they just kept on talking with other employees until I went over. Behind the food line employees were complaining about someone. But the players card had some fun stuff on it.! I also won $$100 bucks so that was fun. Then my friend dragged me out of the casino. Oh forgot to mention the buffet was 37 for two people which is cheap for Vegas. But you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"We have 2 rooms here with a room key for senior prom! The AZZhole security guard, WE WITH A ROOM KEY which is policy, would not let us in. WHAT KIND OF FKRY is this? AND ITS STORMING? My beautiful daughter in her prom dress. Never ever do I get so feisty that I want to use my vaporising powers to disintegrate a stupid fk face from the face of the earth, this was the case.   The security guard apologized for his actions and was let go for his unkind ways. It's simple. Treat people the way you want to be treated especially when you have a room key to get to your room!  Life is simple."}
{"text":"We stayed this weekend as a stay-cation at GVR.  This review is for the hotel and the pool/cabanas. We had purchased an early check-in (between 8-11 am) so that we could head to the pool right away on Saturday morning.  We arrived at 9:00 am, and were told that our room just needed to be inspected and then we could check in.  We went to the buffet, ate breakfast, and at 11:30, when no one had called to say our room was ready, we returned to the front desk to see why.  We were then told the room needed to be cleaned, and again, we would be called when it was ready.  At 12:30, we were finally called to get into the room.  So much for the early checkin...  We had a room upgrade to a Grand Suite, which was large and comfortable.  The shower was not the greatest - it seemed as though the shower head had been replaced with a basic model, and it sprayed all over the place.  Not a relaxing shower, to say the least.  Also, the televisions were both old tube TVs - surprising for a hotel of this quality and the suite room.  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable, though.  Our experience at the pool brought our review down a star.  We rented a cabana both days.  The first day, it was overcast, and the cabana attendant comped the price of the cabana as long as we met the food and drink minimum.  The pool was quiet, the food was good, and we had a relaxing, albeit cloudy day.  The next day, Sunday, however, was the complete opposite.  We got to the pool early and ate breakfast burritos to start working on the $150 food and drink minimum.  We did pay $200 for the cabana for the day as well.  For the first hour, it was peaceful and we were looking forward to another relaxing day.  That changed quickly when about 20 people showed up in the next two cabanas.  Over the course of the day, that almost doubled, with tons of kids and even a couple of newborns.  When we asked about the max occupancy, we were told it was eight per cabana, but sorry, they were overbooked for the holiday weekend.  We ended up leaving around three after chasing children out of our cabana, and being constantly peppered with water guns by children and adults alike.  When we brought this up to management, their response was \"It was a holiday weekend.\"  No discount, not even an apology.  We could have just laid by the pool in a lounger and saved the $200.  Next time we will know better.  Wish we had known in advance about the lack of policy enforcement for the cabanas.   Overall, not a great experience, GVR.  Needs a lot of work to bring us back.  Especially when we can stay at other hotels for the same price and actually enjoy our pool experience.  And have flat screen TVs."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm back. I came back for bingo and Pizza Rock for a family friend's 21st birthday this past Saturday night. This was the best birthday celebration that I've had with someone. He played E-Roulette for the first time and cashed out at around $25. Mind you that I wanted to try E-Roulette out too, but I didn't win as much as he did. We didn't win at bingo either, but my family friend had an awesome 21st birthday."}
{"text":"Driving in, this resort looks very nice and glamorous. Looked like we were going to a paradise. We took the kids down to play in the pool. The pool was very nice with a good size and even has sand on one end for the kiddos. I didn't like the fact that the pool was closed at 7pm though. They started kicking everyone out and the sun was still out. It's summertime! C'MON we wanna swim longer in the Vegas heat.  Furthermore, the life guard who was manning the tower wasn't really paying attention to the occupants of the pool. He was a younger guy, just fumbling around with this sunglasses, looking down and bored. Clearly not really doing his job. The rooms look pretty nice though, although I noticed the tile job in the restroom was a little bit sloppy. We had a nice view of the pool and jacuzzi. Overall, I would have given the place a 4 star if not for the things listed above."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to stay. We added one night here to turn our two-night trip to Vegas into three nights. So glad we did.   Pool is phenomenal with a sandy beach, and cushy lounge chairs. Ample umbrellas and poolside service. Rooms were super comfortable with a sitting area, luxurious bathroom, and comfortable bed. This place was recommended by a family member and we were so pleasantly surprised. This visit to Green Valley Resort changed our idea of going to Vegas...we don't want to stay on The Vegas Strip ever again.   Service in the Coffee Shop was very slow, but the food was delicious. Get their players card (Boarding Pass), you'll save money at the buffet and earn points! Highly recommended, and we can't wait to come back for another stay!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous ! Give yourself a treat and enter through the lobby valet it's beautiful ! I love that I'm not rushed into the Casino as soon as I enter and I can take my kiddos right out to the pool to play in the sand !"}
{"text":"Yeah, I would go back and play in their Poker room again.  It was smoke free which is a rare treat in Vegas.  Dealers and fellow players are friendly."}
{"text":"Love Green Valley. I come here for the spa.  Better than any strip spa because of the nice and private pool. A Hidden gem."}
{"text":"GVR is a meh'fest. They don't do anything great, but they don't really butcher anything either.   Food - OK. The buffet is standard, but you can count on it. The coffee shop is gone. China Spice has pretty good sushi. The Italian restaurant blows. Food quality at the casino-ran restaurants is average Station quality. If you've eaten at any Station restaurants more than once you know what I'm talking about. Food court is a win.   Gaming - OK. They have full-pay video poker, including Loose Deuces, but the denominations don't go up very high. They usually get the newest games, but they're packed for weeks after they come out. And the slot-club essentially sucks. 1,000 points = $1 cash back. And not even real cash back! And multipliers don't count! And full-pay video pokers is $4 to 1 point! There was a time when Boarding Pass was one of the best slot clubs in town..that's no longer even vaguely the case.  Amenities - OK. They have a movie theater. And a nice pool. Who doesn't these days?  Decor - Faux fancy. And that's faux fancy from 10 years ago. Typical Station."}
{"text":"I was fortunate to be able to visit Green Valley Ranch for the first time in January 2007. I am a myStation member of the Station Casinos and get many comps and offers each month at their various properties, but received an offer for 3 free nights here (quite surprisingly, as this is one of their more upscale properties.)  Arriving in Las Vegas very late on the first night, the layout of the property seemed a little confusing at first, which some users have commented about. It really helped out to stop and get a map of the property upon arrival. One thing to make note of is that the location of the casino in relation to the hotel lobby entrance are complete opposites. The parking garage out front is the first thing you'll see coming in off the highway, but the hotel lobby entrance is actually on the complete other side of the property, far from the casino. This is something to consider if you've got bags and are not using valet parking. I did happen to notice that there is a new parking garage, The Paseo Verde Garage, which is now located on the corner of Paseo Verde Drive and Carnegie (the property's surrounding back and side roads,) right next to the hotel lobby. This is definitely where you want to park, not only for convenience to the hotel, but it's much less crowded.  Check-in was very rapid and led to a couple of surprises. As many of you know, casinos very greatly in the incidental room deposits they charge people. Some don't charge anything, while others can charge a fortune. It was stated that there is a 19.95 per night resort fee, which I was expecting, but it was waived since it was a comp offer. I've never had to pay incidental deposits at any Station Casinos property. However, the front desk required a $150 per night incidental deposit, and this isn't stated anywhere directly. Being a slightly more upscale property, I guess they can get away with it, but it's important to watch out for these charges, at both check-in and check-out, especially if using a debit or credit card...your trip can get ruined as the money's gone as soon as you check in! I opted to pay the deposit in cash, which was no problem for them, and got it all back at check-out. (Probably better on my end, so I didn't spend all my money in the casino.)  The next surprise was when the desk clerk said, \"We appear to be sold out of standard rooms.\" \"What does that mean?\" I asked. He said, \"Well, we'll just have to give you a free upgrade.\" The upgrade was to one of the Grand Suites in the West Tower which normally run $650-$700 per night! I'd say, that was quite the upgrade, as comped rooms sometimes tend to be the cheaper, standard ones. Along the way, I heard the music pumping from the Whiskey Bar and I can see how the vibrations can affect guests in the East Tower, as others have mentioned here. When I got to Grand Suite 2203, it was like stepping into another world.  I haven't stayed in too many suites, so I had never seen anything like this place. I was almost scared to touch anything at first. A half bathroom was located in the foyer. Through the hallway opened into the living room, complete with a fully stocked martini bar (Grey Goose flavored vodka, bleu cheese stuffed olives, the works,) a mini-bar complete with everything from snacks to condoms, a solid oak table with four chairs, a dual-line cordless phone, a floor-to-ceiling painting of a nude woman, armoire with plasma TV and stereo DVD system, a fur-lined sofa, loveseat and coffee table.  Moving into the bedroom led to some more unique artwork, a recliner chair, a Bose DVD system, another amoire with TV and wet bar, and a large writing desk. Fur-lined pillows and Egyptian cotton sheets on the pillow-topped king size bed, along with huge closets everywhere. Safe, ironing board, laundry bags, completely stocked.  The bathroom was huge, complete with robes, slippers, a scale, a large jetted tub, dual sinks, a glass-enclosed steam shower and a separate toilet room.  Housekeeping and turn-down service were excellent, and came twice daily. The daily paper was delivered each morning at my door, which featured the newer electronic push-button \"Do Not Disturb\" signs.  The only restaurant I visited was Fatburger, which is always great. I don't patronize high-end casino restaurants and usually opt to save money by eating elsewhere. It was very convenient having several restaurants, supermarkets and pharmacies within a 2-3 block radius of the property.   To sum things up, this property is awesome, and this was one of my best trips to Vegas. I prefer the off-strip casinos and hotels, so this worked out great (especially the upgrade.) The location is close to some of the other properties I visit which was also good. The staff seemed very friendly and organized. I'd recommend Green Valley Ranch to everyone, it's like a whole little world far away from the Strip."}
{"text":"Nice hotel casino resort.  Nice location with shopping and restaurants within walking distance.   Been to the casino and shopping here several times.  First time staying at the hotel.  Comfortable beds, quiet and spacious rooms.  Very happy with my stay here.  I will return."}
{"text":"When it comes to the hotel itself and the entertainment available we were very pleased, however the service could have been better.  We arrived around noon and our room wasn't ready, now it was before checkin time - but we had made a note on our reservation that we would be early.  I was on crutches and had to wait 2 hours for a room.  The room we got was on the pool which wasn't a problem except for when there was a concert that sounded like it was in our room. I wasn't feeling well and couldn't sleep because of the noise.  We called the front desk to ask for another room and they would not accommodate us - they didn't even offer anything to make up for the trouble.  We took advantage of the spa, the pool and the casino floor and were happy with them all. The staff at the spa was awesome and our massages just as awesome.  The pool was just big enough to keep the grown ups from the adults which made it much more relaxing than other public pools.  The casino floor was a casino floor :) I don't know much, but there was enough for us to do.  One of the most important things to me in a hotel is the service and for that reason I can't give Green Valley Ranch 4 out of 5 - so 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"If you're planning a relaxing vacation at the Green Valley Ranch Resort, be prepared to have your room given away before you arrive and to be forced to sleep on a rollaway bed. Our long planned girls weekend away was sadly disrupted when the 4 double queen rooms (count them 1,2,3,4 rooms!) we reserved were given away (probably to the highest corporate convention bidder) despite arriving within an hour of check in time. An unsympathetic front desk scolded us for not reading the fine lines of our online reservation agreement and assured us that all the hotels do the same thing. Is that suppose to make me feel better?  Our much needed break from husbands and screaming kids tumbled into a wasted time trap of packing and unpacking and packing again with a dozen plus phone calls to the front desk, trying to get double queen rooms for at least one night. Our bags were piled high onto bell hop carts minutes before our spa appointments, just in time to pay a lot of money for massages during which our minds are racing with hopes of obtaining  enlightenment on how we became roomless at such a nice hotel.  Don't bother calling ahead to make sure everything is in order. It didn't work for us."}
{"text":"My wife and I just spent Labor Day weekend here and we are so glad we did.  The Green Valley Ranch is off the Strip and to us, especially on Labor Day weekend, that is a major plus.  It is perfect size, not crowded with a good size casino and great restaurants and bars to choose from.    We ate at the buffet a couple of times and it was good, as far as buffets go.  The selections are aplenty.  We went to Sushi + Sake and LOVED IT.  It was just what we needed because we wanted to eat light, but something tasty.  It definitely was that.  We went to Hank's our last night and were blown away.  The martinis in the bar are AWESOME.  (Try the ginger or pear one)  The service in the restaurant was AMAZING.  We really felt special and we are just regular people.  The rooms are nice and comfy, the bed is very nice and the bathroom was big and roomy too.  All in all, it was just an all-around great experience and we will definitely be staying there again at some point in the future."}
{"text":"I don't know wtf is wrong with this location. We go to Red Rock quite a bit and always have great experiences. We grabbed a room last minute on a Saturday at Green Valley Ranch and are trying to enjoy a pool day today.  The room we got was not clean. There was literally a band aid stuck to the bathroom floor from a previous guest.  The service at the pool is sub par.  We literally ordered a second pitcher of mai tia's in a pitcher half the size of the first and they are trying to tell us it is the same size. Come on Station's you are a lot better than this. Highly disappointed with Green Valley Ranch as a whole. The pond location is very nice for 21 plus but you can make the experience so much better.  I'm follow up to this I went to the concierge and gave them my cell number to talk about it with the GM onsite.  We will see if they call. If they make it right I will be the first to post the follow up.  But it's been 45 minutes so we will see."}
{"text":"We enjoy the elegant feel of this resort.  The pool area of the best.  The restaurant options excellent.  We have been here twice, and love being away from the strip while enjoying the climate and golf of the area. The only downside is learning to navigate the hotel from the west tower to the public areas, but after a day or so, you figure out the short cuts.  We love the rooms, the spa and the shopping next door."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time!! Stayed here on a recommendation from a friend, I will be sending her a big thank you!! One of the nicest resorts we've stayed. Not overcrowded in the casino, dining choices for everyone. The pool area was perfect for families and singles. Didn't have time to take advantage of the spa but definitely will next we're there. We definitely will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service right when you walk in the door. Gorgoues views of the pool and their Christmas decor. I was nervous to try a new salon, especially after many failed attempts. I highly recommend Kassidy Howard,  professional and talented!"}
{"text":"No POOL ACCESS at a 4-star where you PAY A RESORT FEE! unbelievable! Beautiful furnishings but the beach pool is shut down in 78 degree weather. Misery during a great long weekend holiday. ANd they have the nerve to charge a $27 RESORT FEE ON TOP OF YOUR HOTEL ROOM PRICE!!!!!! Although very far from the strip, reserved the place for Valentines weekend because it was 4 star hotel. Even encouraged 3 other friends to join up! Very unfortunate that the hotel management has decided to NOT OPEN THE POOL so it sits there in all its tempting beauty with cabanas and waterfalls all around.  Also, it's not as quiet in the room as you would expect. I can hear people in the two neighboring rooms talking."}
{"text":"Poor Customer service from valet: Drove in to Valet with my new $55,000  2014 RAM Hemi 4X4 and was treated like shit! Sorry I didn't bring my 2013 SA7 Audi maybe I would of been treated differently.  And Valet guys thank you for informing me you make roughly $65,000.00 a year. Perhaps a education on ethic and respect for those who help you to make your $65,000 a year would be warranted.   Poor Customer Service at Check in: Very Rude And Short with answers and response to my question. Perhaps at least a smile when you call the next person in line up rudely. I'm sorry I'm bothering you while your at Work!!!!!!  GO TO RED ROCK!!!!!!  Never staying at this hotel again management wake up!!!!!!! Your hotel and services are dated and lacking."}
{"text":"The staff at this hotel are uniformly pleasant, knowledgable and professional. In that sense it is a step up from the other Station Casinos properties. The pool is also a very nice place to relax - it is probably the best thing about the hotel, after the people.  Otherwise, this is a glorified Fiesta. Scratch that - even the lowliest Fiesta hotel room has a view. If you're lucky, you'll get a view of a parking garage at GVR - some rooms have views of walls. The high rates do go far in keeping some (but not all) of the riff-raff away, though in addition to the rates you will get nickel-and-dimed with resort fees, upgraded internet access fees (it's an extra ten bucks per night if you want a reliable connection for streaming), and insane prices in the gift shop and other outlets (three bucks for a bottle of Corona, three bucks for an iced tea in an eight-ounce cup at the pool).   It's a Courtyard that tries to pass itself off as a bargain-priced Four Seasons, but the design is defective. If you can get in here for 70 bucks a night (including the resort fee) and low expectations then go for it, otherwise you will feel short-changed."}
{"text":"Great, clean, nice place to hang out, bring your visitors, or enjoy a night out for locals. I really like GVR they have everything I could possibly need for a fun day or night. Love the sports book for betting or watching sports, dig the food choices with the buffet, the coffee shop and pizza rock - oh and panda and also capriotti's .. can't go wrong here. I don't gamble (thank god) so not to worry about that, and the smoking, I hate it although it is allowed, it's not to bad. Thanks GVR for providing the locals with a fun, classy, beautiful environment."}
{"text":"The resort was fabulous HOWEVER, we had items stolen out of our room. The resort denied any wrong doing on their part. We have stayed at many resorts and have never had this happen before. We even called the resort once we left and let them know that an item we reported missing was found and not stolen. The resorts attorneys sent our attorney a letter denying our request for video tape footage. We were honest and forth coming about what was stolen and were denied any resolution. The resort was fabulous but the aftermath horrible, we are done with Green Valley, too bad it was a beautiful place."}
{"text":"I love Green Valley Ranch for many reasons.   It's off the strip so not as hectic.  It has lots of great restaurants.  It has a very nice food court  It has excellent shopping.  The parking is easy.  I love the Casino It has a great movie theater It has activities for kids  The buffet is half the price and double as good in quality than any on the strip.   It's also close to Lake Las Vegas which is always fun to visit if you want to explore the surrounding areas around Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone could have anything bad to say about this place ! We just got home after spending a long weekend at Green Valley Ranch.   Rooms- large! High ceilings, great decor and super clean!  Pool- the pool is perfect for kids and adults ! There is a sand area leading to the pool that is great for little ones. Plenty of lounge chairs and nice towels are provided ! We were super impressed with the atmosphere here !  Food- we did not have one bad meal! Everything was delicious. We had breakfast at he Grand Cafe (huge portions, well prepared , great service) Borracha (my husband and i shared  the carne -asada burrito, best carne I've had in awhile !!) and we had Pizza at Pizza Rock (we made it to happy hour for dinner. We all loved the personal pizzas for $7) all of the food on site was reasonably priced and we had great service all around.  Movie theater - how convenient to have a movie theater in your hotel!   Anyways, I think this facility deserves 5 stars and we are telling everyone we know to visit Green Valley Ranch !"}
{"text":"This is a review of the casino:  My husband was on a winning streak at the craps table, and was accused of \"cheating\" and kicked out.  The truth is that a group of people saw him winning and started betting with him, so they were all winning.  The \"house\" lost big and got pissed.  My husband is not a clever gambler, and is still confused as to how you can cheat at craps.  It was pure, dumb luck.  When he went to speak with the head of security the next day, he was told that they couldn't explain HOW he was cheating, but that he just was.  Hmmmm.....So, you are happy to have us there as long as we are losing money, but when someone wins too much, they are no longer welcome???  Not cool, Green Valley.  In the end, you have lost a lot more money because our family and friends (Who used to frequent GV) now avoid coming there because of his treatment."}
{"text":"The buffet was great! Lots of variety of meats, loved the meatloaf in gravy. Prime rib, turkey breast, pork roast, etc. Mexican, Italian and Asian specialties.  Better than on the Strip."}
{"text":"Been our go to hotel since we found the gem 5 years ago. The pool area is amazing!  Staff is extraordinary and gaming is fun.  How this beautiful hotel/casino got  only 3 1/2 stars is beyond me!  Anyone that compares this hotel to the other nearby station hotels will be extremely disappointed if you go to any of them other than G.V.R."}
{"text":"Great place to stay if you wanna be away from the hustle and bustle of the strip but still be just minutes away from it.  I have taken my family to this Casino many times it is family friendly, has an amazing swimming pool area and at one time had the best pool are in Vegas.    Another reason I like this place is that you can still play a craps game for $5 on New Years Eve!   This is the time all the other Casinos on the strip raise the minimum bet to $25"}
{"text":"GVR is a really nice establishment and has managed to not turn into \"just another Las Vegas hotel and Casino\". The rooms here are beautifully decorated and have a fully stocked mini bar (beware of pricing). The staff will make sure that you are taken care of and will not leave you feeling like you just blew a couple of hundred dollars on crap.    Being a local Las Vegan i like to enjoy a stay-cation from time to time and this is definitely one of my first choices. They have excellent dining facilities, and the quick bite spots. The theatre is really nice and they always have plenty of space for you to enjoy the latest flicks. Parking is close to the casino so you don't have to take a death march to check in, dragging your luggage and family for what seems like forever."}
{"text":"Nice casino  awesome  location. But why has all slots have high minimum  bet with very little or no payout. And don't  order a drink anywhere in Vegas while playing because you know that saying what happens in Vegas  stays in Vegas well so do the drinks.. they rarely come and if you get lucky enough for a watress  to ask ..the drink either never comes or takes forever... fyi..VEGAS. . We tip when we win and when drinks come... just sayn' give a little and you will get a lot back.. folks who win and get drinks are what made  Vegas... not rude servers tight slots and cocktails  that never arrive.."}
{"text":"Saw Detroit at the Regal theatres.  Great service and place was clean and neat.  Food was good.  Movie depressing, but solid."}
{"text":"Love love love their pool area. The poolside bar is also a plus. Very chill, not too crowded, so it atually feels like a vacation and not some frenzied spring break kinda just turned 21 madness. The beds are bliss. And i've been to some supposedly swank hotels, but this bed beat out everyone. The only way it could get any better would be to accessorize it with some gorgeous virile male specimen according to my specifications.  I don't really gamble and the food establishments here are so so. But this is definitely the perfect place to recover from whatever u were doing on the strip. Ahhh..."}
{"text":"The GVR resort and casino is probably one of the top casinos in all of Vegas.  People will call it a \"local\" resort but with the great shopping and dinning options at the district @ GVR it is without any doubt a place to make a part of your Vegas adventure."}
{"text":"Review for pool only....this place hates locals. Despite Station Casino's slogan that they love locals & other Station Casinos offering \"locals\" deals,  GVR won't even let you in the door unless you're a hotel guest. Their spa even does local discounts but the pool is a non-option according to their towel girl.  No apologies,  no options....just attitude for locals that used to love coming to eat/drink here. :("}
{"text":"One of the better Station Casino's...  It's in the better side of town.. it' feels more \"upscale\", although they all seem to smell the same like any other casinos, i'm not too thrilled about .. i wish they had a non-smoking section..   anyway.. i won 80 bucks within a minute of seating at the gold fish game by the sportsbook so that was a plus..  the service at the sports book bar was ridiculous.. we sat there for a good 15 minutes , lost 20 bucks each on the machine before the bartender even looked over our way on the other end of the bar, of which was not far, since it is a sportsbook bar on a friday night.. it wasn't too crowded...  but green valley ranch casino is a more preferred local casino in my opinion since it's not as ghetto as the other locations with the exception of RR.."}
{"text":"This review is for the casino only, as I have not stayed in the hotel portion of the resort.  Since moving from North Las Vegas last year, I have been to Green Valley Ranch countless times. I really enjoy coming here for just about everything....but to gamble! lol I have friends and co-workers that say they hit here left and right, but with the exception of one glorious 4 Aces hand, I have yet to really hit squat! So I usually save my gambling for South Point since I've actually won over there. But I digress..  They have a pretty good little food court there with a Capriottis(Yum!), Fatburger, and Panda Express(Love me some Panda!), Villa Pizza(see seperate review), and a few others...  I ate at the Buffet about 1 1/2 years ago, so I don't think it would be fair to do a review at this point. But I remember it being good, but not spectacular. Very much similar to both Aliante and Red Rock Buffets, both Station properties. (Although recently Aliante was sold and is no longer a Station property...but again, I digress..)  They have a Regal movie theater downstairs, which I go to quite frequently. Gotta love those $6 Tuesdays!  One of the best things about GVR though is that it is always very clean (restrooms included) . Even though I noticed others complaining about smoke smell, I am a non smoker and I just dont get that. Than again I work in a casino, so maybe I'm a bit de-sensatized, but I've never felt a strong smoke oder like I do at say, a Terribles Casino or the like...  I did try the cafe once and was underwhelmed, but will give it another chance one day(see seperate review)..  but one of my co-workers swears by Hanks! I swear I will try this sometime in the near future! I have heard too many great things about this steakhouse to not give it a shot!  Their race and sports book is pretty much a standard Stations book, crappy lines but a lot of space, comfortable seating, and multiple screens..so you could do a lot worse there..  all in all, I really like GVR, so long as I don't feel like gambling..lol..go figure  4 stars."}
{"text":"If I could give negative starts, I would. This place HAS THEE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! They discriminate against people of different color and did not even try to hide it! The manager, was not helpful at all. I would put all of the rude people on blast if I knew I wasn't going to get filtered! I will be contacting Hastings Law firm for the horrible horrible weekend I had with my family there. We even booked the mediterranean suite because it looked to fabulous. Later we found out the carpets have not been washed for how many years, mold in the restroom, and just plain horrible.  The worst part? RATS RATS RATS RATS RATS RATS and BABY RATS!!! Ewwwwww!!! I felt bad for people who were having thier wedding held there because as soon as I saw the rats, I didn't even want to leave my room. Maybe I should call the health and food commitee to have them check out the place? Sad part is, Green Valley Ranch was my ALL TIME fav spot to be in Vegas. We started going there when it first opened... When I was about 18! I'm 30 now... Green Valley had a special place in my heart. Up until now, I have never not once felt discriminated on until I went to Green Valley recently. What a horrible mess it has become.  One more thing. The chlorine in the pool is to strong! I didn't even dip my head in the pool and my eyes were watery the WHOLE time while watching my son. Sorry but this place SUCKS. They couldn't even admit they were wrong. Horrible place to not be a great customer service person!"}
{"text":"Beautiful hotel and very family friendly. The pool is fun and relaxing! We had an issue with ants in our room and the manager apologized and refunded a nights rate after returning home. Because he was able to recognize that this was an inconvenience, I would go back, but I would ask not to be on the garden floor due to the possibility of ants."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful room, beautiful hotel, amazing customer service. Relaxing spa, beautiful pool.  A+++"}
{"text":"After my first review, one of the managers finally called me.  We agreed that they would send me a free night's stay because they \"Couldn't refund my card...\"  Since then, I have not received anything in the mail or any credit on my card, or even a phone call stating something has changed.  I also read other reviews about the HOTEL itself.  NONE of them were good regarding customer service when there were problems.  GVR is going to go under.  The management there is TERRIBLE.  Shame on them..."}
{"text":"I love this place.  All the staff is super nice,  the rooms are huge and beautiful. the pool area is sour rounded by palm trees and cabanas, I felt like I was in Hawaii until I saw the desert outside.... What an oasis!  The buffet  is the best deal in town.  I highly recommend the green valley hotel."}
{"text":"The hotel is a maze to walk in, every corner I turn looks just like the previous ones I've taken, but is overall very nice with very friendly staff.  I stayed on the 7th floor of the East wing and had a really good view.    I had breakfast at the pancake place.  The eggs benedict was awesome (or maybe I was just really hungry at the time).    I had lunch at the buffet and it wasn't that great, even though I was dying of starvation at the time.  I didn't finish my plates; I think the salad was the best part (and I normally don't even eat greens).  The fruits didn't have too many selections.  I love pineapples, but the ones I had here was not that fresh nor flavorful.  I walked out still starving.    I had dinner at Hank's Fine Steaks and Martinis.  I made reservation for 7pm for a business dinner, but didn't get seated until 7:20.  Then when we were seated, the waiters took super long to get to us.  We ordered wine for everyone at the table, but only some of us were served.  The martinis are awesome though!  The steak was good and side dishes are yummy.    Perhaps I'm just not used to the indoor smoking, but I think I got sick from it and I only stayed for 2 days.  Overall, it's an OK place, secluded and away from the busy Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"Our family of 5 (2 adults and 3 kids) stayed at GVR as the final leg of our Spring Break.  After being in cold weather in Flagstaff and Grand Canyon, we were happy to be back to warm weather!  We booked the room from Hotwire for $87 (hotel then charged a resort fee of $25, this becoming annoyingly typical).  The room  was very roomy and comfortable for the 5 of us.  It's elegantly decorated and we had a view of the pool which the kids couldn't wait to get into.  When you check in, they give the kids buckets and shovels so they can play at the pool's 'beach.'  This was a real hit with our children.  We had dinner at the Feast buffet.  As other reviewer mentioned, the crab and the option of having it cooked up with their special seasoning was a great treat.  The dessert spread was typical of any buffet, nothing really special.  However, they served gelato!  There were about 6 flavors.  My espresso gelato was yummy.  I wish we had more time to spend here.  Our family would definitely be back again as another option to staying on the strip."}
{"text":"Nice local casino but the casino floor is too smoky for my liking.  A better filtration system would really be of benefit...or banning smoking, but I know that will never happen in Vegas."}
{"text":"We went to their \"seafood buffet\" last night since we were happy to see their seafood night had been brought back. What an utter disappointment. Incredibly long line to get your crab legs steamed. The quality is also not there...not from how I remember from a few years ago.   The \"sushi\" is some kind of rice-looking roll but it doesn't taste like sushi rice...tastes like some mass produced item.   The rest of the non-seafood offerings are just meh. Oversalted and overspiced.  Sad, this used to be one of our fave buffets for us and for entertaining out of towers but we will probably not be back...."}
{"text":"**This Review is for the Pool Area Only**  I went to the Green Valley Ranch pool to take in some sun, a few drinks, and relax with the locals...annnnddd I kind of loved it! There's plenty of room to layout and sip an adult beverage, plus the douche factor here seems minimal. I'm sure this varies from day to day or weekend to weekend, but I don't really see a reason for many out-of-towners to come all the way to the GVR Pool.   The pool has a nice beach entrance which is great for kids and for all those parents who need some well deserved R & R. They also offer cabana rentals with covered seating, bottle service, and for the ballers, you can enjoy the VIP area called, \"The Pond\". This area looked cool from what I could see, but it was literally a small peek as the door was closed. There are also small and shallow wading pools, that halfway surround the main pool for those extra small water lovers.   The pool is free all of the time unless there's a private party. If you plan on being a regular here I would recommend getting the VIP card. You'll get special offers and maybe some extra love at the bar. Bring a towel and no hiding booze, because they may check your bag before you enter the main pool.   This is a great spot if you want to feel like your escaping from the rat race for few hours or the weekend for a staycation!"}
{"text":"I loved the roulette table slot machine.  I think more casinos should add them.  Didn't think I'd like GVR Casino but I didn't want to gamble anywhere else.  I will definitely be back (next time to trap the craps slot)."}
{"text":"Gorgeous hotel. Gorgeous pool. Gorgeous fitness center. However, paper thin walls and the AC was not working well. In NV, you want your air conditioning to be working like a charm, but mine was on \"fan\" mode and couldn't be altered, so I slept on top of the covers because I was so hot! Reception couldn't do anything about it because it was on \"eco mode\" to conserve energy. So I slept with a cold washcloth on my forehead for over $200/night.   I also value my sleep and I stayed here during a work trip only to be woken in the middle of the night with doors slamming, guests coming back drunk and talking loudly, and I could hear an entire conversation next door to me by a guy on the phone. (Thank god it was just talking.) I could hear every single word. The wing I was in was also under construction and they started early in the morning. My room was also near an outside door from another part of the hotel and people would go out there to smoke and take pictures, so I didn't have much privacy and the luxury to have my curtains open because people could look right in at me.   The staff was professional and kind but it seems a very tip-heavy place. I tip when I've had exceptional service, but I was honestly exhausted from not getting sleep due to the AC, other guests, and construction. Don't think I'll be staying here again."}
{"text":"WOW is all that I can say. We are locals and booked a room for our anniversary. Having The District within walking distance was an extra bonus. This hotel is gorgeous. Luscious landscaping and a lovely pool/spa area. Some nice bars, buffets, and restaurants to fit your fancy. The lobby and hallways were beautifully decorated. The entire hotel was neat and clean. The smell of smoke from the casino was barely noticeable.  The room was the icing on the cake. The perfect size for 2 people. A comfortable king size bed and fluffy pillows. The bathroom was so awesome with the garden tub and connecting shower. A very nice place to relax. I can't get over the fact that there was NO outside noises that could be heard while in the room. No traffic, elevators, other guests above or below, the AC, doors closing, the refrigerator humming, water flowing through pipes,etc. Obviously these are all issues I have had while staying in other hotels, but not GVR. I have found my home away from home, my oasis, my sanctuary."}
{"text":"This review is based on the casino and buffet. Machines are tight, not very \"local\".   Buffet is very \"station\" like and they serve crap with a long wait. Good thing my buffet was free.   All I see, is a fancier Palace Station."}
{"text":"My overall rating would range somewhere between 3.5 and 4 stars.  I took one star off because the hotel charges additional resort fees each night during your stay there.  My room was in the West Wing so I can't comment on the newer, East Wing rooms.  However my room overlooked the pool area and offered a decent view of the Vegas backdrop at night.  The room itself was lofty, clean, luxurious-feeling and spacious.    I did find that having to walk around the 2nd floor in order to reach the casino area a bit annoying after a while.  I doubt that would be the case if you were staying in the East Tower though, although I could be wrong.  Apparently the hotel is set up so that the casino is the gateway to reach other destinations whether it be the theater, the District or the restaurants with exception of the pool and spa area.  Be forewarned that internet access is a whopping $1 per minute in their business center so I would advise you to bring your own laptop.  And if you happen to move anything around in the minibar as I have just learned, it would automatically be charged to your card.  Apparently there's a sensor in the fridge that sets off if items are taken out or moved around.  I had some leftovers to save for later and I needed to make room in the mini fridge.  I was not aware that it would set off the sensor despite my efforts to put everything back at the end of my stay.  Water is also expensive there (or so I was told) so I would suggest making a visit over to Whole Foods and stock up.  It's also nice and convenient how the District is close by the hotel.  Adds for a bit of distraction and broader options to dine and just walk around the shops/boutiques as the sun is setting.  For my brief stay there, there was something to do at almost any given moment (and I don't gamble).  During my last night there, I managed to catch 500 Days of Summer in their theater below.  Something I did not expect to hear coming from a hotel, it's almost unheard of in the East coast!  Being that I am unemployed and flew out to Vegas for an interview, this was as close to a vacation as I was going to get.  My stay there lasted 3 nights and 2 days.  Overall I am happy with my choice here and don't regret the experience I had either as the staff is very friendly.  Just make sure you keep track of the surcharges they may add to your card is all."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful Mother's Day weekend vacation here. The accommodations are lush and beautiful; the service at the hotel was also on point. Highly recommended especially the pool and the spa. I didn't do any gambling at the casino, but I did visit the bingo room for one game. It was my first time and it was rather crowded, but the fellow guests were so nice and willing to help me figure it out. I ate at one of the cafes and found that also heavenly. The pastry case was lovely."}
{"text":"It's a Station Casino property with an upscale feel. Not sure how to describe the decor other than dark old money.   Buffet for whatever reason is 3 bucks more for not much different options than the other properties, although I did see shrimp on the Monday night dinner buffet, so maybe that's why.  The Regal Cinema offers $6 all day movie tickets on Tuesday.  Parking seems to be ample with both a ground lot and a parking structure.  Nothing great, but nothing horrible at Green Valley Ranch"}
{"text":"Great resort if you want to plan a great golf outing with your friends and family. I was really surprised I always stay at the WYNN but this time I was chorused by the group to stay since we would be playing Rio Secco golf track. Well, to my surprised it totally exceeded my expectations.  This resort is really upscale and the people (gamblers & resort staff)  are really nice as well....the resort doesn't attract low life's. The steakhouse HANKS was great too. I stayed in the Tuscany Suite (only $500 a night) that suite would be $4000 a night at the WYNN. The pool was awesome as well."}
{"text":"I stayed at Green Valley Ranch 2/22 - 2/25.    Upon arrival at the airport, I went to level 0 to meet the free shuttle to the hotel.  The shuttle was right on time.   Check in was a little slow, but a full shuttle of us arrived all at once, so that is expected.  Room:  The property is lovely.  I asked for a room close to the casino, but quiet.  I did not care about a view.  I was told the East Tower was closest, but you have to walk outside, around the pool to get to the tower.  OK in February, no one was there, but if I stayed again, I would go West Tower, which, by the way, seemed a lot closer to the casino anyway.  My room was average at best.  It was clean, and it was quiet, but just ok.  For the price, I expected just a little more pizzazz.  Casino:  Huge.  Every new machine.   Almost no one in the casino, and after 3 days of losing, I can see why.  No casino lets you win, I get that, but at least for $500 a day,  you should be able to play a litlle, get a bonus now and then.  I never once saw a jackpot of any kind being paid out.  I was later told in Bingo that no one really plays the machines here, they are so so tight.  My gosh, they just were.  Food:  Ick.  I cannot comment on the buffet, I never got in.  The lines at almost all times of day were so long, it was worse than the airport security check points!   The cafe was ok.  Kind of slow service but it was ok.  The food court is limited.  Panda Express had really OLD food just sitting there and no one making any fresh.  The pizza place was similiar and for $6.00 a slice at that!    Fatburger was actually quite good.  If it had not been raining, I would have ventured out to the District, where many food venues were available.  Amenities:  I did not use any of them, I was there for a tournament, so I did not have to pay the fees.  The pool did look nice, and so did the gym, but I did not use either.  Floors:  This is important.  The floors are a very uneven tile.  For ladies that have anything other than a tennis shoe, BEWARE!   I saw so many ladies, myself included, struggling to get to the carpet near machines, just to keep from falling.  With so many seniors in this place, I found it had to understand the design of these uneven tiled floors.  They look nice, sure, but CAREFUL....  Store:  EVERY Hotel, of any kind, has a store.  You forget something and need to pick it up, and I was stunned this place had nothing at all but soda and cigarettes.  No shampoo.  No soap.  No toothpaste.  Nothing.  OH, they had a nail clipper and eye drops.  Just so understocked I could not believe it !  Shuttle to Airport:  I got lucky my flight lined up with the shuttle schedules.  They run every two hours so if you miss one, it is a long wait.  Also, it is small, about 14 seats and it was full both times.  You must get a ticket 1/2 hour before, so plan ahead.  There were several people upset they had to take a cab as the shuttle was full.  But great service for those of us lucky enough to have read reviews and knew this was an issue!    All in all, I would probably not stay here again.  It depends on WHY you are going.  It seems like a nice place to relax and get spa treatments, but not gamble or have a hip time in a club."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in the hotel. The first time I went there, they were sold out and even though I had a RESERVATION, there was no room for me. I was sent to the strip and had to drive 15 mins to the hotel everyday for the business meeting that I had to attend there.   They give me a letter of apology and a complimentary 2-night stay. I tried to redeem it years later and then they say the offer 'expired'. WTF? There was no expiration date on the letter. I don't mind losing at the gambling table but this is a total rip off and poor customer service!  Maybe I should speak to an attorney."}
{"text":"This was the first time that we drove all the way out to Green Valley. Knowing that its part of Station Casinos, I didn't really expect much out of it. But unfortunately, Its way more then I expected.   Its bigger then most station casinos out there and one of the nicer ones. Of course, it was kind of confusing at first, but it sort of makes sense. We were trying to find the garage but there very well hidden. Of course, being the first time going there, you basically get lost very easily. But the garage, you'll see an entrance way at one point, then you go up another level and its just a big parking lot. Of course you then realize, the garage is under you, and we're just on the top floor. A bit further down the way is another garage, but we decided to just park at the first parking we saw.   From the looks of it, it was very well detailed on the whole structure. Its like they actually took the time to make this place look appealing. To me, I was really impress on how they made the outside look so elegant. The inside, had this warm feeling to it. But on the other hand, it tend to be crowded by all these slot machines. Which is kind of a downer, but it is a casino/hotel. I just wish they use less slots, but I guess that's how they make their money. A lot of their restaurants are well designed and detailed, that it makes it look interesting on what this restaurant is. I'm sure people just want to know that its just a sushi restaurant, but putting something extra, puts a bit more of a spin to it. I do like their creativity when it came down to these restaurants.   We came to Green Valley to watch Aaron Lewis in concert at the Ovation. The Ovation itself was a nice little venue. I honestly think they can probably make it better. But the design outside and inside was very nice. I gave the Ovation a decent review, but it could of been better.   Overall, Green Valley Ranch is a nice place to look around. Its one of the busier Station casinos. So I'm sure there will be a lot of mix reviews. But I would probably say, that if your there to eat or play, then that would be a great place to check out. If you're there to stay or watch a concert, don't set your too hopes to high."}
{"text":"Stayed only one night. Really nice staff. Rooms are really nice, love the bathroom. Pool area was awesome spent the afternoon getting a tan. Hotels.com during the week is awesome"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to hang your hat in Green Valley.  The slots seem to pay OK.  I live closer to Red Rock but find this location to be better."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to say even though this is a pretty nice Hotel, the fact that I was placed in a room with a window facing the Parking Structure and the stairs right in my face was a terrible experience, especially since I had to wake up early in the morning to the sound of people going up and down the metal parking stairs. That room should not even exists, and even if it does it shouldn't be assigned to anyone on a Sunday night when obviously 90% of the rooms were empty!!! Also there was weird noise coming out of the toilet pipes.   Everything else was good but the kind of room I was in needs to be the last room given out, along with a warning from the front desk about it having a parking garage view with super loud stairways right in your ears!! I was going to ask to be moved, but had to walk a good 5-7 minutes all the way to the edge of their east tower just to get to that room, too tired to complain, and I shouldn't be the one to tell the receptionist about these things anyways!  This place is pretty far from the Strip by the way, in case that is why you're going to Vegas, make sure to calculate $50 cab rides, each way, to the Strip into your budget. Although apparently there are some shuttle services available.  The best thing about this place is the awesome pool area. Lots of room to hang out and have a fun day out in the sun.  I only had a one night experience, and it was not a good one; disappointing enough to make me write this review! As a business, most of the time you only have one chance with a potential customer, and this one was lost."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for one reason: The $4.99 breakfast buffet!   Yeah it's ridiculously cheap. HOWEVER, in order to get that price, you must get the bording pass. It's free to sign up so just make sure you do that before lining up to the buffet.  We got in 30 min before they started serving the lunch items so we got to sample both their breakfast and lunch offerings. Highlights of our meal(s) were their omelet bar, scalloped potatoes and the carved meat area.  Also, beverages are included so don't worry about paying additional fees."}
{"text":"It's rare that I give a 3-star review, but my experience was mixed here. Particularly, some staff were great and others lacking. The front desk seemed very unhappy and unhelpful overall. By contrast, the pool, restaurant, and buffet servers were awesome at all hours. The venue delivers on promise, but I personally would love more resort and less casino. Bowling or laser tag or rock climbing? I don't know. Even with the property at full capacity, the gaming floor looks sad and empty -- maybe reallocate 30% of it for other fun things. Most of the younger generation is steering away from typical vegas gambling anyway -- they'd rather buy experiences. Just my input."}
{"text":"Maids are shady and will steal your stuff! Our ac only cooked the tom to 77° and after several attempts to fix it they offered us a different room on OUR LAST NIGHT!! Oh and for our troubles they gave us a food or beverage credit for $50 and 2 free buffet meals. Are you kidding?!?! This place is almost $200 a night!!! It was 111° outside and almost 80° in my room! And we left an item in the room, we know we left it in the room and it isn't in lost and found... You know what that means? A maid has a new painting that belonged to my daughter. You would think a nice resort would have maids with higher standards, but no. They are shady theives just like the ones at crappy places. I'm beyond disgusted with this place. Won't ever stay here again, and won't recommend it. Well be posting this on Facebook, travelocity, booking.com and every other travel site I can find."}
{"text":"Fantastic food- completely fresh and affordable! Loved the Mexican flavor in our breakfast. Empanadas and veggies tacos for breakfast were great! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We rented a Cabana today and honestly not sure if we will ever go there again!! . Seems like every year they get cheaper and cheaper with their Cabana rentals. They charge you $150.00 for the cabana and you only get Fiji and Pellegrino. We had to ask for the fruit tray because the waitress never brought it. Honestly the tray is a joke! We were told the limit is 10 people per cabana. The one next to us had a huge party probably 15+. It smelled like weed which came from the Cabana next to us. Classy especially when we had kids (4 and under) with us. Our server was sweet that's the only reason we are giving you 2 stars. Oh also you should really have someone who escorts you to your cabana. We were just told to go up to the bar and ask for someone to help us. I'm sorry that is not good customer service. Ugh what's happened with our customer service Vegas!"}
{"text":"Green Valley is perfectly fine as a hotel.  It's a little dated, but the upkeep is pretty good.  The rooms are spacious, as are the bathrooms.  The room service is usually timely, and housekeeping is always friendly.  But there are some problems with GVR: - We were charged $300 for a stolen blanket, which we never took.  We didn't see this charge until well after the required 3 days after checkout.  (We did an express check out and didn't check our credit card statement until later.)  The next time we stayed there, we talked to a manager, who said we needed to talk to the daytime manager.  We did that and never heard back.  $300 gone.  - The check in line can be quite long, sometimes wrapping around the entire lobby with a wait of an hour.  - To get from point A to point B, it almost always requires going through the casino.  I realize that's the point of being in Vegas is to gamble, but there is a lot of wasted time walking through the casino to get to other places on the property.  - The shower doors don't close well and almost always leak water onto the floor.  If you're into gambling and want somewhere nice but off-strip, this is a good place.  If you want something off-strip but classier with similar (and often cheaper) price point, try The M, just off I-15."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this after a trying out the Westin (almost on the strip) and was very disappointed with the property; staff were great and apologetic...but I need running water (long story...another time) when I vacation and the Westin was having none of that...so I yelped the Green Valley on my mobile....smartest move EVER.  Great place to stay...super friendly staff...with lots of recommendations on where to go...which I find important especially when I go to Vegas.  I don't really get into the whole Vegas 'let's go to a buffet' scene and the buffet here was pretty underwhelming...although my wife loved it and she tends to be pretty picky about the food situation.    Should warn you that I am not the typical person who wants to go to Vegas and get stone hammered every night...so found the off strip location perfect for me.  Drove to the Strip in 10 minutes..shuttle is pretty flaky so wouldn't really count on it...were I you.  Grounds are gorgeous and you do get a whole different (read more pleasant less inebriated) vibe staying here.  The pools are fantastic; they had live music one night when stayed there.  They have an \"adult\"  pool area that is cordoned off from the rest of the property and it lived up to its rep.  Best part is that they are very pooch friendly...to the point that I was offered 2 extra bottled water/day to make sure HE stayed hydrated.  One weird thing I never figured out...they have a mini vineyard?!?! on site...but nobody knows anything about...not sure how it will taste now that Blizz has 'watered' those vines though...so stay away from any 08 vintage they eventually produce."}
{"text":"August 6, 2016 I reserved a 2-Queen non-smoking room through Expedia. I paid an extra $20 to guarantee that arrangement.  Upon my arrival, I was told that when booking through Expedia there are no guarantees. Guarantees are only honored if booked directly through the hotel.   A King bedroom with a rollaway bed was never an option AND would have totally defeated the purpose of paying extra for the guaranteed arrangement.    My confirmation and the extra money spent on a guarantee meant absolutely nothing to the men at the front desk.  I had clear proof of my booking.  My email confirmation read plainly confirmed 2-Queen beds non-smoking.  Never did I expect to be deceived at booking and then shoved into an accommodation that would have never worked. Please tell me the whole purpose of booking a 2-Queen bed non-smoking in addition to paying an additional guaranteed fee for an arrangement that would never be honored upon arrival?  There was nothing hospitable about this experience.  Front desk lacked the skill required to resolve the issue of accommodating the two-Queen beds as I had expected.  We dove 3  1/2 hours feeling secure that our room request would have been met.  I had spoken so highly of Green Valley Ranch resort and spa from past vacation stay experiences and was so sad to have to eat every word.  We had such high hopes and expectations that our reservation needs would be met as we had paid extra to ensure the proper room needs. I would soon learn that GVR overbooked and never had the specified room to begin with leaving us to waste precious time in search for a hotel replacement that would keep to their end of the deal.  Also, at no point was I made aware that the hotel was undergoing major renovations at the main entrance and not all amenities would be available during my stay.  My experience with the front desk staff was unforgettable in the worst way.  It was so easy and came so natural for them place blame on Expedia and to look past the guaranteed rate and room in my confirmation email.  The apology offered by the front desk was rehearsed as if this happens all the time here.  When going on vacation everyone you encounter and the experience as a whole should be pleasant, hospitable, and accommodating at the very least.  GVR FAILED to go above and beyond to ensure a great guest experience. Tourist should be able to trust that when reservations are made that the arrangements are honored and upheld especially when extra money is paid to guarantee the request made.  Green Valley Ranch resort and spa hugely underperformed in this area. Just know that a confirmation from any other source other than GVR will not be honored!"}
{"text":"Part of the \"Station\" chain, beautiful casino! Definitely adding Pizza Rock to the itinerary for next time... the smells coming from that place were to die for! Convenient parking, short walk to the fun, and security on segway's just in case you need something."}
{"text":"I will say that I have never stayed in the hotel here, but I visit this casino frequently.  It is a great place to stay if you are from out of town and not interested in the Strip.  There is a mall right outside its front door with great restaurants like Lucille's BBQ, The Elephant Bar and the Cheesecake Factory, along with a Coffee Bean and a lot of nice stores.   The casino itself is very nice.  I have been to them all and the Red Rock and Green Valley Ranch are the top two casinos in my opinion off of the strip.  Very clean, and it is kid friendly with a movie theater and I think it has a bowling alley, not sure.  Great place to come and gamble, although I would recommend staying away from the slots, I feel like they are really tight there compared to other places, but it is a great place for table games."}
{"text":"I go to vegas a lot now... Seems like about once or twice a month. Somehow I almost always end up here.  Green Valley isn't one of the most well-known or elaborate resorts out there but it has a quaint (If there is indeed a casino that can have any sort of a 'quaint' quality) that keeps my boyfriend and I coming back. The people who work there are so sweet and are very kind and helpful with everyone they deal with. I witnessed one of their employees dealing with some pretty difficult people. They were very professional and I diplomatic.  They do have a buffet which we frequent most visits. There is a wait but then again there is probably a bit of a wait for all buffets in Vegas. Although they do have a number of yummy dishes, they don't have the largest selection. There are probably better buffets out there but this one is affordable and they stuff they do have their is pretty decent.  The machines are random. The first time we played we won $60 when we played with only $4. Most of the time your wallet will end up lighter when you leave. Such is Vegas!  Big Plus: It also helps that there is a singer that I really adore that seems to play in their awesome lounge/bar every Saturday night. My mom and I are planning to go see him this summer! Hope he is still there ^_^"}
{"text":"not vegetarian friendly.  took over an hour to get in the buffet.   they do not like feedback."}
{"text":"Here is another casino that we play at when we're in town.  Casino part is ok.  It's a little bit cheaper sometimes than the strip but not always the stations casions (this is if you're playing tables).  They don't have that many 1 cent slots as the stations casinos.  Food here is good.  I like the shops that they have outside.  Even the movie theater is nice, which is a change of pace if you want to take a break from eating/gambling."}
{"text":"GVR endeavors to be included in the conversation with the finer luxury brands in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, it becomes immediately apparent that the staff is trained and ruled by the same Station Casinos management philosophy that oversees local day casinos at the four corners of the valley. The property staff is transactional in nature, robotic, and mired in bureaucracy. For a more satisfying customer-centric experience I recommend paying a little extra and staying a classier establishment."}
{"text":"The GVR is a nicely appointed hotel, spa and casino. Unfortunately the customer service is only reserved for those who arrive in style or throw money around and overpay for things.  The valets will lie to you and then have a deal going with the front office to put you in a room that is pretty crummy so you would have to upgrade for a cost that can be as high as $200 more.  I can afford to lose $200 on a single hand but I do not like to be insulted by pit bosses or the help.  The food is just food.  Complaints to management is useless. Typical Station Casino attitude.  Why do older people like to meet up in this place is unknown to me. Someone said that GVR attracts those people who would be intimidated by Aria, Bellagio, Wynn, Paris...Cosmo... I can't think of a redeeming quality of actually staying again after 3 tries at this establishment.  My last event that caused me to write is when my wife was conned into paying for $1,500 room service that never occurred.  It turns out that Registration decided that a suite should be charged for a case of cheap champagne that was never delivered.    Since then, I have informed the medical trials group to hold events somewhere else and quit trying to save money in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Stayed here Dec 26-28 2013 with family--wife and 3 kids under 10 yrs old.  Free valet parking, Starbucks onsite in casino food court, friendliest staff including at the tables, adequate rooms (without coffee pots).  My son left his iPod in the reception area and didn't realize it until we were in our room about 10 mins later.  I called the front desk and they found it...impressive.  Close enough to the strip without being there...quiet and clean for the kids.  You can avoid the smoke of the casino for the most part, altho the buffet is adjacent to the casino so a little smokey.  Agree that the place is a little bit of a maze at first but it's good since it keeps the hotel portion away from the casino.  East portion of hotel is farther away from casino than the west wing if you get the chance to choose.  Pool view is worth it if you care, altho the pool is closed for winter months.  Will come back with the family."}
{"text":"So glad I had prior yoga classes because this event was intense. The pool side venue is such a beautiful spot to set up our mats either by the pool, on the grass or in the courtyard. Checking in queue did not take long due to having iPads provided & a link for self check in through your own phone before retrieving headphones. Around 6pm was a good crowd ready for savasana. It was my first time ever using headphones for yoga. The DJ had this cool beat called blue dream I suppose which totally matched my breathing at one point. If you have never done yoga this will probably be a deal breaker just because instructions were fast and I didn't feel connected to my instructors until the very end with the positive affirmations once my breathing took a life of its own. The music threw me off with clubbing beats when in reality it shouldve matched the flow of the practice."}
{"text":"Incredibly gorgeous hotel. I love the architecture of this true gem. It is greatly appreciated. Enjoyed the free concert with \"Steel Panther\" on Saturday nights. What a treat. These guys are hilarious and good! : )"}
{"text":"I didn't spend a bunch of time in this casino, but I liked my time here.  It was new, clean, well organized, and not too smokey... and I won $40."}
{"text":"Hey, those GVR people must have read my review, because it looks like the rooms have been remodeled since the last time I was here. The hotel hallways look a lot chicer with dark walls and abstract patterned carpets. The rooms also got a makeover and the armoire with the tv has been replaced by a set of drawers with a big flat screen. The place is looking better than ever!"}
{"text":"Love this hotel casino and their buffet is one of the best is Las Vegas and Henderson. Must try!"}
{"text":"Reservation was incorrect.  Locking me out of my suite, door stuck, had too be disassembled by engineers, nothing available due to wedding party taking over hotel. Front Desk RUDE.   Casino smells like ashtray, toilets clogged unserviced. At 21 & over pool no seats available due to wedding not enough loungers for hotel guest. Bartenders RUDE . One Star is being kind. Don't waste your time with this inhospitable establishment. Unsupervised Children Fist fighting in hallway... here at Hotel currently and my bed has bed bugs. I have bites w/my blood on the sheets!  BEWARE"}
{"text":"I spoke with Slot casino host and I was asking for food comp. He says I don't qualify because I have to loose $1000. He says I was only $150 away. I told him I'm not going there anymore. He told me HAVE A NICE DAY!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you're in Henderson and too lazy to drive down to the strip. There's great shopping, some good restaurants, and even Whole Foods across the street!"}
{"text":"The staff at the Green Valley Ranch Hotel are very helpful and provided amazing assistance to deal with a missing letter to a guest! They are the best!"}
{"text":"On our way home from GVR now.  I give 3 stars to the hotel over-all, but give the pool staff at the towel cabana 1 star.  My husband and I stayed one night.  The check in was good and they had our room available upon arrival.  The A/C did not work and we waited 1 hour for someone to come confirm the motor was out.  They called for us to be moved which was a pain since it was on another floor, but it was a better pool view room.  Rooms are nice and bathrooms are spacious.  The dealers were all nice in the casino.  My BIG complaint is that the roulette number postings were not working properly at 2 of the table and not at all at 2 of the tables.  I think it is misleading and deceptive to show numbers posting only 50% of the time.  REGARDLESS of the odds, players look at those numbers and often players walk up and play black or red based on what they see hitting.  I complained to the pit boss and several dealers and nobody really addressed it.  It was annoying, but I still had fun and the waitresses were pretty regular with the drinks.The hotel, pool area and casino are very clean.  The pool area has a LOT of wasted space and the pool is too small.  The biggest joke was that we got coffees inside at Coffee Bean and walked outside to lay by the pool today and were stopped in our tracks and told we could not bring our \"outside\" coffees into the pool area! So ridiculous!  In addition to the bad rule, the girl had a bad attitude and pointed to the sign to explain the rule.  I tried to lighten the air telling her it was my birthday and the 1st coffee I had had in 40 days (since I gave it up for LENT) but she had no words for me.  So we had to sit on the wall and gulp our coffee before entering.  An older couple walked up with their GVR coffees and they were abruptly told they could not enter, either.  Very ridiculous.  We will not be returning. If you are looking for a non strip hotel, Red Rock is MUCH better!"}
{"text":"Called the GVR spa to make an appointment for my 30th birthday for a massage service and facial, about $300 in services. When making the appointment I was informed that I couldn't use my locals discount because the massage I picked wasn't covered. I then went back to the main website and noticed that the verbiage clearly stated 20% off services on Friday and that this discount can help with doing a second service or even upgrading to a better service. Which was exactly what I was doing! I was bummed as I had based my decision after a few hours of research on that locals discount. I explained to the girl I was speaking with that online it never mentioned anywhere that this was only on certain services under their \"we love locals\" section of the website. She said that it was not on that portion of the website but unfortunately she couldn't honor it. She then spoke with her manager Caitlyn Applegate who said that she would not honor the locals discount regardless of what was stated online and that she completely agreed with the verbiage stated online. Even though it completely contradicts with what was being advertised! But she would give me a different massage that was the exact same price as the massage I wanted for a discounted price, which I thought was really strange. Why give a discount on a massage that's the exact same price but not on the one I wanted?I was then transferred to the manager Caitlyn Applegate and she was immediately on the defensive. Her comments were rude and definitely not the type of customer service I would expect from someone who is working at a spa that charges 200 a treatment. She also ended the conversation laughing saying \"hope you have a wonderful Valentine's Day\" in the most contradicting tone. She had the opportunity to really create a wow customer service experience and impress a local client that frequently uses spa services. As well as make someone extremely happy on their birthday. Instead she had a sour attitude and has created what could have been a loyal guest into someone who will never think to use their services again. It's a shame!"}
{"text":"My local station casino! I love this place because of how easy it is to get in and out of the sports book when I want to run in and place a fast bet. Also I usually can find a seat here when watching the NBA finals or playoff football in the Fall. Also this casino foes have allot of promotions including free bets, buffet deals and tons more. Hands down my fav station casino in the vegas valley."}
{"text":"Love the property. A good place to go to just relax away from the hustle and bustle of the strip. We were checked in by Kammie who was very sweet. When we needed to retrieve something from our car, Mike at the valet save us the trip and brought it to us. The only reason this place gets four stars is our encounter with the wait staff at the feast buffet. She was not very friendly or attentive. However she was very nice to the other people around us. Seems to me that she did not like folks if my nationality. The food there was okay. Due to the cold treatment from Ileana, we will not eat there again. We had breakfast before checking out at the Grand Cafe. The food was tasty and our server Shanna and hostess Mai Mai were a delightful pair.  We will definitely be back to GVR for another getaway. All other employees we encountered along the way made us feel welcomed-a class act! Mahalo GVR for a wonderful stay."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about the Green Valley Ranch.  On one hand, I love that they lent me a wheelchair (at no cost) since I was injured and on crutches.  I am thankful for that assistance on my recent stay.  I was impressed that when I called housekeeping to let them know we spilled Jamba Juice in the hallway, they cleaned it up quickly.  Cleaning of our room each day was not so impressive.  I could tell we didn't get vacuumed.  The poor construction of the shower door resulted in a puddle of water each time it was used, and most of all, I was unimpressed with the selection of food available throughout the day.  While they had a 24/7 cafe open at all times, there were only a handful of casual spots in the food court, and the Chinese & Japanese restaurants were only open for dinner.  I'd highly recommend adding a Starbucks.  The poker room was a nice size, but I never saw it full.  I played in one of the morning tournaments, and was surprised the blinds and running time weren't posted on any screens for the players.  My friend thought there weren't enough chairs for people down at the pool, as many people had to lay on the grass.  I'd much rather stay at their sister location, Red Rock."}
{"text":"Green Valley Ranch has significantly decreased their level of customer service of recent.  We often frequented GVR, being local to the area, but we will take our business elsewhere going forward.    The service today was utterly horrible. We scheduled a cabana at their pool and only found out when we arrived that the water misters were complexly broken. According to the GVR staff, the misters had been broken for the season and they were working to fix them.  This would have been good to know when I reconfirmed the reservation a few days ago as given the hot temperatures today, the misters would have made the hot temperature quite bearable.  To that point, we had a villa at the Paris a few days ago (on a hotter day) and stayed at the pool all day largely to the misters and jumping in the pool as needed.  Without the misters, however, we had to leave the GVR pool early to get out out of the heat.    On top of needing to leave the pool early, the staff of the casino and pool were rude and surly. I complained to the Pool Manager, who eventually told me he'd \"throw us a 10%\".  It felt like we were dogs being treated with a bone.  I told the Pool Manager that his discount was completely inadequate given that I would have gone somewhere else or used the regular pool.  The Pool Manager indicated that his supervisor, Danny Perrera (not sure of his name spelling), would only authorize a 10% discount and that he would not speak to me since he was in a meeting.  I will still come to The District to visit Lucille's BBQ, but Green Valley Ranch - not so much..."}
{"text":"I've been living in Henderson for two years now and have stayed at GVR twice since relocating here. I love this resort and the hotel staff is always so welcoming. I can't say enough about how great the front desk is with helping to make our stays comfortable and relaxing. Being located not far from where I live now is a definite plus since I am not a fan of staying on the strip anymore. The District is right across the street and the movie theater at the resort is one of the cleanest in the area. Love love love this place."}
{"text":"Until the Red Rock (http://www.yelp.com/biz/red-rock-casino-resort-and-spa-las-vegas-2) came along, the Green Valley Ranch was option numero uno among the growing property list of the Station Casino empire. It was and still is a very complete resort, a property with a little bit of everything. GVR recently celebrated its 10th anniversary, which in Vegas years means the novelty has worn off slightly. Despite that, it remains a great destination for all and is a great value for any stay.  Similarly to Red Rock, GVR is off the strip. So off as a matter of fact, it's in Henderson (i.e. not Las Vegas). Relax I-only-stay-on-the-strip fans, it's a 10-15 minute shuttle ride at best from McCarran airport and is probably faster to get to than the Sahara, which is technically still on the strip. But like any good off strip property and especially those in Henderson, it means this joint is likely a locals casino (#1).  As a hotel, GVR is definitely delivers. There are a multitude of room types, all of which are modern, contemporary, and feature some of the most comfy beds I've slept in. Everything from the regular sized rooms to the mega suites that could sleep 30, are available and for far more reasonable prices than most of the ones along Las Vegas Blvd. And at nearly 500 of them, there is plenty to choose from. I say, try to score a room near their pools - the view of the strip is nice, as is the amenities poolside.  Casino enthusiasts should be able to appreciate the large casino space, which offers over 70 table games and over 2,000 gaming machines. Blackjack fans should be able to get their fill of over 30 tables dedicated to the game and poker fans will have a  decent variety of games to chose from as well. Their player rewards program is competitive, comp points from play is definitely transferrable to other Station properties. Dealers are usually quite friendly and the cigarette smoke is controlled rather well for a large space. The cocktail staff could definitely use an upgrade, but I digress.  In terms of eats, there is a decent selection but the outstanding venues are a bit limited. Hank's Steaks & Martinis (http://www.yelp.com/biz/hanks-fine-steaks-and-martinis-henderson) is the obvious winner of the bunch and then there is the pitiful TIdes Oyster Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tides-oyster-bar-henderson). I echo the pains of eating at Grand Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-cafe-henderson) though the Feast (Around The World) Buffet (http://www.yelp.com/biz/feast-buffet-henderson-3) has been fantastic and mediocre at varying times. It's no In-N-Out, but Fatburger (http://www.yelp.com/biz/fatburger-henderson-2) is gut bustingly good. Sushi + Sake (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-sake-las-vegas) is a fun time, especially for their AYCE deal. Italian joint Terra Verde (http://www.yelp.com/biz/terra-verde-henderson) is decent during lunch, though I much preferred it when Hell's Kitchen winner Rock was still running the show.  GVR has a lot of random amenities, which really distinguish it from it's nearby (or far away depending on how you look at it) properties. Like the Red Rock, there is a movie theater. The Pond (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pond-henderson), is a real cool and relaxing alternative to their sick pools. A great place to catch an outdoor concert is at The Backyard (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-backyard-henderson) and Ovation (http://www.yelp.com/biz/ovation-henderson) is a real concert venue. Every casino has a center floor bar and in GVR's case, it's the Drop Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/drop-bar-henderson). I'd also recommend visiting the Lobby Bar (http://www.yelp.com/biz/lobby-bar-henderson) as it's probably the closest thing to a club GVR has. The property may not boast a lot of shopping, but it sits right next to The District (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-district-at-green-valley-ranch-henderson), a village of boutique and luxury stores, just perfect for those looking for an escape from the casino. It's rarely ever crowded, but then again, neither is the casino.  Though GVR could probably use an upgrade on a few things, the property itself is good enough to warrant a 4.5 star rating. It's versatile, stylish, and spacious enough for all visitors. Folks who are teetering the idea of staying off the strip with almost everything at their disposal, should consider GVR as their next destination. ___________ (#1) This is a very, very good thing."}
{"text":"So the pillows are wonderful and the bed is comfy.  The attached casino will make you reak of smoke if you walk in there. You will be nickled and dimed for EVERYTHING!  No freebies or extras here.  Would I stay again? Maybe,"}
{"text":"This place is great! My parents come here often and I join them once in a while. The host that helps us is Tony Constantino. He's a great guy!

{"text":"We were invited for the New Years' Eve party.  The check-in went smoothly, the gentleman was very professional at the front desk. The room was fine except for the central air unit.  We had a similar problem in the summer when the a/c wouldn't cool the room properly.  This time I developed a cold and we had to crank up the heat to attain a decent temperature.    We had room service for breakfast and it was impeccable.  I still wasn't feeling well by lunch and we ordered in again.  I was craving a nice big bowl of chicken soup and my wife ordered a vegan soup and a salad with lemon vinaigrette.  My soup was fine but the bowl was so tiny.  My wife ordered a cup of soup and it was the same size as mine.  Her soup was some weird semi-solid gazpacho-appearing soup that was bloody awful. The salad was ok but the dressing was not a vinaigrette--it was too creamy.  It almost tasted as if there were cinnamon in it.  We were also disappointed by the food in the Grand Café.  She ordered chips and dips and all 3 were terribly bland.  We had chips and dip out at the pool during the summer and she loved it.    The rest of the stay was fine with the exception of the very tight video poker machines.  The party was well-done except for the fact that they didn't plan for vegans eating there, which is the case with my wife.  We tried to explain to the lady who waited on my table, but English was not her first language.  Such is the case more and more in this country unfortunately.   Overall I can't rate the stay higher than a 2."}

GREEN VALLEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES!!!"}
{"text":"GVR is the business, cousin (I am a white person)  Anyway, I am a huge fan of GVR. It's my local place, where I see 90 percent of all the movies I go to, and where I go for oysters (Tides, bro).  Anyway, GVR is a nice casino and not as...something...as Sunset Station. It's hard for me to review an entire Casino Resort (and Spa!) but I can say the rooms are immaculate, spacious, and very comfortable. The food options are awesome (Hanks!) and the atmosphere is friendly (as casinos go).  I really like seeing movies at the Regal Cinemas located downstairs in GVR, so I will strongly suggest you patronize them. Terra Verde is pretty good, as is the buffet. The Grand Cafe is a more expensive but equally crappy version of Denny's.  I have zero knowledge of the hotel staff's personality, skills, competence, etc. I won't bother speculating."}
{"text":"Cant beat the value for this spot. I recently stayed here for one night with my husband and loved it. The rooms are beautiful and spacious and very clean. The service was great. We ordered room service a couple times and the food was decent. Nothing spectacular and of course, over priced but what else can you expect from hotel room service? The buffet and cafe were also pretty good and more reasonably priced. The only thing I hate is all the smoke in the casino but I suppose that's really unavoidable. We saw a movie and went to the spa. The spa was lovely. Overall, a great time! Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the Green Valley Resort & Casino and the Station Casino organization. Upon check in we were asked If we wanted to upgrade. We would ONLY be paying $225 per night. We thought Wow what a deal. What wasn't made clear was the fees were over and above what we already paid. The front desk gave us the impression that we would ONLY be paying the $225 per night. Then we got the bill. Yikes!!! Spoke to the front desk supervisor. Because we signed the agreement  nothing could be done. Asked to split the difference. Too bad so sad.. We stay at the Station Casinos when ever we are in Vegas. Need to rethink that for future visits."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Beautiful spa with hot and dry saunas, indoor hot tubs, outdoor private pool and hot tub, spa treatments, poolside food & drink service... THE WORKS! But the staff here is even better! I just ended a business trip and came to relax at the spa after lunch before heading to the airport. I ate lunch at King's Fish House across the street from the resort, and ended up with food poisoning. It hit me when I was at the spa pool, so I went into the locker room to use the bathroom. Silvia, who works at the spa, noticed I wasn't well and spent the next two and a half hours taking care of me while still doing her job at the spa... She went above, beyond and out of her way to make sure I was okay and had anything and everything I needed! She even called security to bring me a wheel chair so I didn't have to walk from the spa to the front desk to check back in. (Its a pretty short walk.)  Silvia, thank you so much for all your help and care today. You are one amazing woman and the GVR Spa is lucky to have you!  Also, want to give a shout out to Rick on the security team for wheeling me around and helping me to get checked back in and settled."}

{"text":"Green Valley Ranch \"The Buffet\" ..... Why?  I have a really mixed review for this. I am a food and beverage manager by trade so I am very patient when it comes to the in's and out's of the restaurant business. We have eaten at the Green Valley Ranch Buffet on three different occasions. The first two occasions were on holidays and the buffet was amazing and although the lines were long the end result was good food good service and just a great time had by all.  This past week was an entirely different story...  I took the family to the buffet, looking forward to a great meal as usual, it was a Wednesday night during Easter Week, and after the debacle at The Golden Nugget this should be an easy pleaser..... Wrong! We were sat in the section facing the dessert case, the dessert case was smothered in filth, and the place was swarming with people. Maybe they were caught off guard with the amount of people that went there but the food line was a war zone. The Asian station was filled with food that not only looked dry and unappetizing but no one was doing anything about it.  When I first started out I did a drive by the dessert station to see if the case was dirty on the inside or the exterior and it was definitely on the exterior of the case, also noted that the bread pudding was emptied and the apple streusel was bordering gross looking. The vanilla sauce was broke and there was separation on top. The line was normally filled with fresh items usually very few fried products but tonight it was filled with everything fried, I'm not sure if Wednesday is Fried food Night but we were certainly in it. As I finished my plate of palatable food I turned to the dessert section once more, although there were plenty of cakes and pies on the inside the single person working was smothered deep in the ice cream section leaving the rest of the place to fin for themselves. The bread pudding was still empty, the apple streusel was even worse now and most of the pies and cakes were gone. I went along and asked for the Chef and a nice lady asked if she could help and I explained that the dessert lady needed a lot of help and she said she would help her. Still no chef to check things out and the front of the dessert station was getting worse, my wife pointed out that the food actually spelled out CRAP and as I looked at it sure enough written in food on the front of the case was \"crap\" I was laughing because at the time it was indeed crap. It got to the point where I just couldn't take it anymore and I went to look for the Chef again.... The same young lady cook asked if I needed help and let me know the Chef was here somewhere but how could she help me, I asked her to please find the chef to look at the front of the dessert case as it needed to be fixed, it was embarrassing me and I don't even work there. She once again came over to the dessert station and took the time to wipe down the entire front of the dessert glass showing off the 30 or so pies and cakes behind the filth and making the place look a lot better.  Sometimes when we work in a business or industry for too long we become jaded or even cynical to the every day operations, but sometimes things get so bad that even outside people feel the need to correct the lack of action from peers within similar operations."}
{"text":"Beautiful hotel, the room was spacious and elegantly decorated. Quaint. Good service and bonus, I was pretty lucky in the casino!"}
{"text":"So we have been staying here for years but this year was surely different....it all began with the reception....the person there was kinda rude.  Sent us to timbuk two to our room...when I called him to see if we could change rooms he immediately asked what was wrong with our room.  I told him it was way too far and the view of the parking lot was not attractive.  He explained thats what we got for the rate we paid.  Which didnt not make sense because we always got a view of the pool.  When he finally decided to switch us we had to wait 3 more hours for our room to be ready.  So we paid for the room rate plus tax plus the resort fee plus tax and then drinks at the pool have an automatic 18% gratuity....what made it worse is that we brought another family along for their first time....will probably not be staying here again.....so please do not send me any more offers...thank you!"}
{"text":"Loved it here! Beautiful and fun with excellent customer service. Cabanas are the best and you can walk to the outdoor mall. Much better than staying on the strip for sure. Would love to come here again!"}
{"text":"We travel through Las Vegas twice a year so that's a total of four stays at GVR and we've been staying here for years so I consider myself a veteran guest of this hotel/resort.  The hotel itself is lovely, everything is clean, the rooms are great (hint: east tower is a little more Mediterranean in decor, the west tower is slightly more modern) but recently our casino host that rocks, Pete Scarpa Jr., has been putting us into some of the suites which we have really enjoyed. Pete never fails to personally greet us whenever we arrive and we're not that big of gamblers but it's always nice to receive such personal attention.  We started staying at GVR because we tow a boat along with us on vacation, and they have ample parking for vehicles with trailers, RV's and just about any sized vehicle. Their Security is top notch and we have never felt worried about leaving our packed boat in the parking lot.  This past month a cousin and myself stayed at GVR. It was her first visit and I was reminded through her fresh eyes as to why this property is so special. She really enjoyed the feeling of Las Vegas with all the lights and action, but at the same time there is a feeling of being so much more cared-for. The floor staff is incredible, we had some very interesting conversations with personable slot attendants that made us feel so welcome.  We love the new T-Shirt $1 slot area just outside Sushi/Saki and the mini jackpots every few minutes were great too. I won over $500 in casino quick cash drawing during my stay just for having my player's card in a machine. She also appreciated not having to walk three miles to get from one end of the complex to another and she has decided her days of staying on the strip are officially over! SO many places to eat both in the hotel, on the casino food fair and outside in The District Shopping Mall!   It was really hot when we were there so I didn't spend too much time at the pool but my cousin really enjoyed her time there.  The only negative (and this may change, given enough feedback) is that the management has made the decision to remove coffee machines from the rooms and have also done away with the coffee station in the lobby.  This is happening more and more, I see it in other hotels too but IMO if the hotel cannot afford to offer complimentary coffee then at least put in a keurig machine I can use a pod in, and offer pods in the in-room snack bar for purchase. I dislike having to get dressed in order to have a cup of coffee in the morning and I would much rather have the option to buy a cup in my room than have to traipse around the hotel with no makeup and my hair not done."}
{"text":"Nice looking place but too many smokers in the casino made it impossible for me to visit.  Maid service knocked at 9:30a, 10:30a and 11:15a the day I was to check out at noon. I finally expressed my frustration to the third maid and was told something about a red light indicator outside my room... No idea what she meant by that.  You really have to watch for signs leading to the East or West Tower guest rooms.   A \"Resort Fee\" of $25 plus tax for each day you stay is charged and includes a short list of amenities such as Internet service, but if you look at directions in the room, for logging in, it appears there is a daily fee for EACH device that connects.   Not my idea for a place to spend Mother's Day weekend.  I don't think I'd stay for any other reason due to smokers."}
{"text":"This Hotel Casino Resort is located off the strip a good 15 minutes or more away in Henderson.  Green Valley Ranch (GVR) was a 5 Star AAA 5 Diamond Hotel, I believe it has lost one of the AAA Diamonds over the years.  GVR is aging and it is starting to show throughout the hotel/resort.    GVR is a very nice quiet hotel with the Casino separate from the hotel by different wings.  The Pool(s) are located between the Hotel and the Casino with Adult themed, family, and children pools with a spectacular bridge that connects the outdoor bar and the main pool.   The rooms are showing age but the beds are still incredible in offering comfort and room size is decent (standard).  Not advertised but they charge a \"hotel resort fee\" for the \"amenities\" aka wireless internet (T1 speed) even if you do not use it.    There is a good mix of people here with locals and young people to families and serious gamblers.  This is the same resort/casino featured in \"American Casino\" reality show (canceled) on cable/network.  There is an Arcade and movie theater downstairs, the buffet is quite under-rated, a food court with a Fat Burger, and an outdoor mall located directly across the street with good retailers.  All in all I enjoy staying here when I want to get away from the busy Vegas Strip and am looking for some R&R especially for a conference.  The Staff here works hard to please but can be hard to find at times.  It is definitely in need of some updating and work but a nice quiet 4 star hotel none-the-less."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to retreat! The grounds and rooms are in great condition. All staffs were helpful and accommodating. Everything you need is all in one place, you never need to leave the resort! The breakfast buffet was delicious and had so many breakfast, lunch and dinner options to chose from.  The only thing we had a problem with was loud neighbors, but after calling the front desk they were quick to address the issue with the other guests and all was remedied to our satisfaction.  I'll definitely be booking another vacation visit here, especially when it's hot enough to use of of the many pools and cabanas available!"}
{"text":"Grrr.... What happened to customer service?  I asked security for directions:  \"cant you just read the signs lady?\" -- very helpful thank you. I asked the rewards center a question about points:  \" if you ever bothered to read the small print you wouldn't be standing here asking me questions\"... Very nice... I have an autistic son who is nicer than you.  The cocktail waitress:  \" Drinks? Drinks? Hey you???  (Approaches man to my right) You want a drink or what?\" Followed by some gum smacking and long sigh. Wow ... Speechless!!!  Housekeeping spotted in the bathroom, back stall sharing food!!! Gross and saddened to know the employees have to hide to eat.  Go back to back customer service Stations Casino.   As an executive I am appalled at  how your organization  is running.  Treat your employees  with respect, no one deserves to cower in the corner eating food in a bathroom...and for goodness sake ...try some old fashioned manners 101 with your employees."}
{"text":"I recently attended a work conference here and I must say I was thoroughly impressed with this resort.    Work conferences can be both helpful and informative, but also draining and long.  Having it at GVR was a perfect place.  They had many different conference rooms available with a very spacious and easy to navigate floor plan.  The rooms were very nice offering a great view of the pool area and a very nice spacious bathroom.    The food that our company ordered was outstanding.  Every meal they had many options to choose from, for all types of eaters (gluten free, traditional, vegetarian, etc.) When I first got in, I ate at one of the cafes they had onsite, and it was good.    I am not a gambler, but the casino seemed to be spacious and offer a wide variety of guilty pleasures to increase or decrease your wallet.  THe only thing I dont care for is all the smoke in the Casino's, but I know that is just how it goes.    THe location was a bit outside of the Vegas center, but not a bad cab/Uber drive to get to the Strip or Fremont street.    I really enjoyed my stay at GVR.  Thank you fir the great hospitality, delicious food, beautiful views and over all lovely experience."}
{"text":"This is a good place to relax, being in Vegas, but quite far away from the crazy crowd by the strip. We like going back to this place, for service, rooms and amenities. Can't go wrong with this one."}
{"text":"Resort looks very nice and great appearance but rooms have very poor plumbing.  Heard water being ran through pipes all night and hardly got any sleep.  Got groupon deal but look to pay 29 dollars per night for resort fee even though groupon states 24.99 and another 18 dollars in tax per night ( 47 dollars per day).  Spa and workout facilities are kept up very nicely and pool is also very nice."}
{"text":"I decided I'd go all out to show my thanks to my realtor who has helped me with just about everything as I am I new resident to Nevada.  She said she liked steak so I heard this was the best --Absolutely delicious! We both had lobster tails with our petite filets cooked perfectly. The lobster was so tasty I didn't even use the butter. My side was mushrooms--so good and my gin martini with stuffed blue cheese olives was unlike any martini I've ever had. I'll be back for more of them for sure! The service was excellent and the everyone was so attentive."}
{"text":"Never booking here again. God forbid you have to make any changes!! Booked here last night and realized in the morning that the location is too far from events that we will be attending. Called to cancel just to be told I will be charged for the first night, which is 3 days away! No type of effort to assist in the matter, never booking with this place again!!! So frustrating."}
{"text":"This is one of my fave casino off the strip. You don't have to deal with all of the tourists and traffic. Those planning to stay here, it's about 10 miles/20 mins or so to The Strip.  Although I've not stayed here, but heard from friends, the rooms and spa are very nice. The rooms are from $80-$320 during summer the last time I checked.   The gaming area/casino floor is clean and huge and well setup and you can find all your favorite games and have a wonderfull time. Make sure to get your club card for points and nice discount on Feast Buffet.  I love the pool area esp the sand bottom pool named 'The Backyard. ' If you're a local they won't let you into the resort pool unless you have a pass or pay a small fee but call them since the rules are always changing. You can go to the 21+ pool called 'The Pond', it's free and the DJ plays good music.  There are many restaurants to choose from when you get hungry. They have Hank's Fine Steaks, Borracha, Pizza Rock, Feast Buffet, and a few more places. There is also a Food Court.  In addition, there is also a Cinema in the building and free parking."}
{"text":"Second visit to GVR.  Last year we stayed in the basic room, which was clean and a bit larger than expected.  This Trip, we enjoyed the 1,000 square foot suite in the east tower.  East tower is awesome if you want to be close to the Valet and avoid much of the smoke from the casino.  Suite was clean, had the wanted stuffs such as two TVs, a mini bar that can hold a few of your own items.  -not the annoying pressure sensitive kind of mini bar.  No complaints on the hotel at all.  Book direct, sign up for the rewards card, book the low cost room.  You'll likely be offered a low cost upgrade 24 hours after you book."}
{"text":"WORST SPA DAY EVER!!!!!!   I booked what was going to be a valentine romantic massage for 2 from a special that was email advertised. It was a bait and switch as it clearly stated 175.00 for a couples massage, foot scrub, and champagne toast.  1. Got there to discover things were not working in the mens locker room. Steam room was broken and there were workers coming in to check it out....Far from relaxing when you just want to sit quietly and take a steam. The first person I asked said just leave the door open and it will come on. After 5 min of nothing I went to the front desk to ask and sure enough it is fully broken...Would have been nice to know when we checked in.....Attendants did not care at all!!!!!  2. No cold drinking water that the attendants would get me so I walked back to the front desk up the stairs and found a could water for myself...You would think that a spa would have drinking water right?  3. They had some snacks out pretzels, granola, and apples. All of which were stale and the apples were boarder line rotting.  4. The massage was a body massage, foot scrub, champagne special, No one seemed to know about the champagne toast. They came and found us later on with plastic cups of nasty bubbly....would have been nice to enjoy it in the room we has a massage in.  5. Time to go and cant wait to leave. Needles to say checkout was a nightmare. Britney and Rachael were so rude and totally stressed us out after our massage.......The email I got from them and brought with me clearly said 175 for the couples massage. They tried to double charge me and said it was per person......Thankfully I have the email with me and no where did it state per person. Once we got things straight Rachael decided she wanted to be more rude to us by saying we will never offer you a discount again.....How service people like this have jobs is beyond me....I hope this helps others that go there and accept their bait and switch tactics. Always say something and stand up for yourself at these type of places that look to rip you off. This all stemmed from their advertisement for a Valentines day special (bait and switch).  I brought all of my concerns to the managers that clearly did not care about me and my wife. My interaction with them was horrible and when I left I was more stressed than when I came in.  This is the last time I will go to this spa as there are so many really good choices in town. I did give a full tip to the massage therapists as the rudeness came from the front desk. I told Rachael that her rudeness would affect the other workers tips and that would not be right. She apologized with a crapppppy condescending smile  Rachael is the winner of the rudest person I have met this year.....you work at a spa and should send people home relaxed....Epic fail Green Valley Ranch Spa....  I learned my lesson!!!! Never will go there again!!!"}
{"text":"It's a good place just to hang out.  It's a casino, when you live here, it's really no big deal.  I'm not a gambler, so we just hung out and had a couple of drinks."}
{"text":"By far the best resort me and my husband has stayed at from the time we walked up to check in with (Michael)to checking out! Came here to celebrate my 25th birthday. When checking in Michael asked what brought us to the resort we told him for my Birthday. We where getting settled into our room when someone came with dipped strawberries with a card saying \"Happy Birthday\" by far the best costumer service. We also ate at the restaurant Hanks amazing costumer service and amazing food. Thanks Green Valley Ranch"}
{"text":"Beautiful property, convenient - close to airport and right next to an outdoor mall. Not great if you're going to party, but perfect if you're coming for a conference or to lay by the pool. Pool is clean and beautiful!! The bathroom in the room was questionable (mildew in the shower EW!) and the lighting was horrific! Skimpy on the electrical outlets.  NO coffee pot in the room! The room that overlooked a PARKING LOT! Stay away from East Tower 8534. Customer service was not tops - i called about my safe (it was locked) and the woman on the phone was so rude and condescending. I give this place an \"eh.\" But seriously, that pool... And the cool lobby bar!"}
{"text":"I'm not a Vegas fan.  I don't gamble & I'm not crazy about casinos. My husband had a meeting so I decided to tag along for some sun. I LOVED this place!  1. If you don't have kids with you enjoy the relaxing spa pool. Great attentive friendly service & peaceful.  2. Massage- spa! Amazing!!! Steam room. Dry sauna, whirlpool etc... Spa was beautiful & clean & relaxing. Randy gave an amazing massage. I had a great mani pedi from a very sweet girl named Rhianna. She was a pro!! The salon was pretty & clean. Impressive. Wag I had my hair done. 3. Our room was really pretty & clean & bright with lots of light. Our room service lady was SO sweet! She poured my coffee and handed it to me in bed.  4. Drinks we're great. 3 glasses of Pinot & four mimosa . Yum!  5. Staff is SO friendly and professional.  I really enjoyed my stay & will for sure come back.  My one complaint is front desk staff could be friendlier & smile. Also they need to change the brown polyester uniforms worn by some of the staff- Poor things look hot & they are ugly."}
{"text":"I love the pool setting at Gvr because its child friendly. I have two complaints though. I truly believe there should be a designated smoking area so that children and non smokers are not affected by chain smokers.  Complaint number 2:   I absolutely cannot believe that at two separate occasions I have felt harassed for an additional tip by the waitresses. If you are not aware Gvr pool automatically adds an 18% gratuity to your bill for your servers.  Which is fine in my opinion. What I found completely appalling was that on two separate days I was told by my waitress at our cabana \" although a tip was already added, \" you can leave me a better tip if  you feel I did a good job. I totally took care of you, and you know, this is Vegas.. You know how it goes.\"  Ok, so my bill at the cabana was 500+90 for tip So basically 90.00 is not enough, she felt I needed to give her more $. She stood there and gave me a funny look. Either way I felt like an ass if I didn't tip out more so I gave her 50.00 extra.  It didn't stop there. She also kept joking that she wanted our champagne bottle. So, I gave her my comped bottle of cheap Moët. She wanted the yellow label but I didn't give it to her. I feel like an idiot now.  Memorial weekend I returned to the general pool not a cabana.  Upon closing my 188.00 check, the waitress tells me \" I know the tip was already added but feel free to add more of a tip if you want to, if you were happy with my service. You know, if you think I did a good job\". So, I felt pressured again and left an additional tip again! Idiot me!!  This is completely unprofessional. I've never been pressured for extra money. I am a generous tipper being as I am in the tipping industry myself. I would never request a tip from anyone. I hope this review creates awareness so others don't get suckered for more $."}
{"text":"We have gone to the buffer for years back when they had crab nightly and for us it was the best buffet ever. We always ate here one while visiting from SoCal The crab buffet  ended a few years ago but we happened to be in town and noticed the buffet had crab on Friday night so we went We waited for 1.5 hours in line started shortly after 7 pm. They had several VIP lines and sat everyone in those lines before general public - very unfair. The crab legs were tiny baby crab no meat like before and poor tasting This buffet went from the top of our choice to where we will never go back  They are out of town in Henderson and used to worth the drive but  not anymore most other casinos have a better buffet and better service"}
{"text":"I love GVR!  It's always super clean and most of the workers are friendly.  The rooms are beautiful as well.    There are a lot of places to eat inside from a nice food court all the way to high end steaks and sushi.  Hanks Steakhouse is probably the best meal I've ever had.  Try the creamed corn.. seriously!  It will change your life.  Always lots of gaming tables and a couple really cool bars to hang out at.  Drop Bar is especially awesome after 9 or so at night.  The majority of the night shift casino dealers are very nice..  much nicer than most of the annoyed, angry dealers on the strip!!  Love the dealers here.  Don't forget to throw em a tip!  :)  They now have $5 double deck Blackjack 24/7.  There's 2 parking garages and also a large street level lot on one side.  There's also 2 different valets I think.  There's a nice movie theater too!  2 minute walk from the casino there's a shopping area called The District which has lots of places to eat, bars, coffee, ice cream, frozen yogurt, and also some nice shops to buy clothing and other things.  The casino's gift shop has some really nice things in it as well as the prices aren't terrible marked up surprisingly.  The pool is GORGEOUS and has an area with beach sand that goes into the pool.  There's usually more children around than I like but that's why they have a separate 21+ pool.  There's a beautiful private pool for the spa but I've never been able to use it.  :'(  I really can't say enough good things about this casino.  I purposely chose the house  I live in because it's one mile away.. that's either pretty cool or pretty sad.  haha  I am super excited that they fired their casino manager a couple months ago.  She was terrible and was completely ruining the casino!  GOOD JOB, GVR!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local casinos since moving to LV years ago. A little bit of a drive for me but worth it in the long run. I like how the slot machines are spread out and it's not crammed like some places. I hate being around smoke but I don't feel overwhelmed from second hand smoke here. They food court has some nice options for a quick bite and they have some decent restaurants. I noticed they will be opening a few new places and Pizza Rock will be one of them. I don't gamble often but when I do I try and get to GVR."}
{"text":"Stayed here for 3 nights for a small conference and absolutely loved it. Loved how the hotel was a little separated from the casino. It was nice to step off the elevator and not be right in the casino. Room was very nice and good size. Pool was great and so were the cocktails. Not cheap, but pool cocktails usually aren't cheap. We had great food there as well. I don't like buffets but really enjoyed the buffet there. Overall, we had a great experience and a lot of fun. A great place to stay off the strip."}
{"text":"Love the ambience of this casino unlike the Strip. At least the machines give you a payout at times unlike Downtown.  They also have a wide selection of Video Poker machines whereas on the Strip, they don't offer very many of them."}
{"text":"Friday afternoon at 4:00pm, only 1 person working the Cashier Cage and 40+ people in line. Very poor Management. They do not care about Local's as I've overheard numerous times, 'We dont care about the little amount Local's spend here anyway'. This is the type of classless attitudes and lack of Management from the top that give this Shit-Hole the reputation that they have with Local's!"}
{"text":"Was a bit disappointed in our recent stay. Shower leaked and didn't get fixed. Little things that add up to a less than impressive stay. Pool closed early on Saturday.  Resulted in an \"ok\" stay."}
{"text":"Shout out to Tony And Dave at the sports bar! These guys are the friendliest bar tenders in town hands down!  If you are in a bad mood go see these guys at the sports book in GVR!"}
{"text":"Beautiful.  This was a great place to spend the weekend. We relaxed in the warm pool, ate at the tasty buffet, lost twenty bucks gambling and never once left to visit the strip.   There was no real reason to visit the strip. This resort had it all. The staff were very polite and courteous. We had a parking mix up and ended up on the complete opposite side of the resort lost and trying to find the lobby to check in. We found a nice casino worker who escorted us over to the check in desk and also offered to carry a cooler I kept dropping.  The rooms were beautiful as well. The bathroom was gigantic with a huge soaking tub. The bed was comfy and filled with plenty of pillows. Also we had a perfect view of the strip, so we never missed the Vegas lights."}
{"text":"Father's Day Weekend 2014  Hubby had some COMP nights and free tickets to the \"Oh What a Night!\" Tribute to Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons for Father's Day weekend. Since we've never stayed here before we decided to try it out...  5-stars: FREE show tickets H (12-years-old) and I went to the show and we were probably one of the youngest attendees there!  LOL!  We enjoyed it!  3-stars: Pool A very family-friendly pool!  Little O loves the sand area and shallow end. She had fun making new friends.  CON=smoking allowed anywhere. :( Horrible when it's windy and you're down wind (one of the days we were out there)  3-stars: Food Court Typical variety of food court choices--Fatburger, Capriotti's, Frozen Yogurt, Smoothies, Starbucks and Panda Express.  Panda Express had free soda refills if you bought a large soda.   2-stars: Arcade 80 tokens for $20--great deal, comparable to Chuck E. Cheese, right?  Nope!   CON: Games were \"2 tokens\" per game! :( Decent variety of games.   4-stars: Walk to Shopping We liked walking out to The District shopping area, but not our typical stores. The Splash Pad was a great stop for free water play for O! REI was at the end of the shops and we always love window shopping in there. We bought food at Rachel's Kitchen and took it back to our room for dinner.   5-stars: Fitness Room I LOVED this spa because it incorporated the fitness room. I was able to get a locker while I worked out but didn't get a chance to use the sauna or facilities. :( But I enjoyed the drinks and snacks in the Quiet Room for a few minutes after working out. I switched with the hubby and he went to work out while I watched the kids at the pool. Great variety of equipment and clean.   1-star: Casino It sucked up our money fast!  Not a very giving casino. :( Hubby even had $100 free table play...didn't help! :(  Overall, a good experience but I don't think it makes our list of places to come back to."}
{"text":"Green Valley Resort and Casino really isn't that old. It is one of the newer Station Casinos. But it does feel a bit run down inside though. I have never seen any part of this place except the casino, so this is just about that. Each time I have been there there isn't that vibrance and energy that is nice in a casino.   The dealers and staff here are no nonsense. They know what they are doing and have been around the block. There are always $5 tables if you like to gamble small. My drink order did get messed up here twice though and I kind of prefer when dealers are a bit more sociable and actually talk to players and engage in the game instead of making it seem like a boring job. A smile makes losing money so much better.  This is a good locals place and is good if you want low limits for table play, but don't expect fancy. Green Valley is pretty low frills."}
{"text":"I love coming here! The 30% local discount is amazing.  Sue is an amazing massage therapist!( I think that's how you spell her name) and Tina was my esthetician!! She did an amazing job with my facial! I will definitely always book with her every time I come in.  Just a few things I didn't like unfortunately but I'm referring to the receptionists who were not on the same page with their \"new systems\" I LOVE the fact I can have a mimosa while I wait for my services but hate waiting... But they started a new system being able to sell mimosas at the desk which was awesome! (So I didn't have to wait 30 minutes for room service) Brittany the receptionist was great and gave me my mimosa right away. Which was $10. Expensive! but I was willing to pay since it was right away. After my service I was wanting to use the rest of the amenities at the spa which was included....  Before using the pool I wanted another mimosa; I went to the front desk to order one. I noticed Brittany wasn't at the desk it was someone new and she said we don't allow to give mimosas and that I would have to order through the room service or outside bar... I then told her I was served one just an hour ago. She said she was confused because they only do that under certain circumstances( either complimentary or for birthdays) ... I was then confused and let her know I payed for my first one and got one right away. She then said. Let me talk to my manager. She said I'm so sorry we just started doing that today and I will give you a complimentary one for making me wait ( how could I be mad then) but as I was leaving she then told me; so the drinks were just a promotion and we will not be serving drinks anymore. I then told her I would appreciate a little more consistency next time I come in...  other than that... Brittany, Sue & Tina will be the highlight of my experiences here at GVR. I will come back but expect more consistency considering I'm in the same exact business. :)"}
{"text":"At the sports book ready to watch the World Series. Crowded, finger food, lots of excitement, great staff, very very organized, and making some bets!"}
{"text":"The pool wasn't what I expected. Extremely crowded with kids , very messy. Which may have been a result of all the kids running around but either way it was the least bit relaxing and \"upscale\" like they try to pretend to be. The drinks are over priced and watered down. The food is average, nothing to brag about. The girls are not very attractive and have pretty crummy attitudes. I've been there several times and have never gotten a pretty or nice server.  I had a brunette every time which is great but the attitudes on these girls just suck ! Natalie? I think her name was or Natasha something like that. She was the worst !! I think she is just a server assistant but she's terribly snooty. Then we had Sara who was quite stuck up . And a couple times we've had an Asian girl who's name I can't remember but she had the dryest personality and permanent bitch face!  This company needs to upgrade not only their food and beverages but they need to be pickier with whom they choose to serve them! I've given gvr several chances because it's close and the shopping and restaurants have never disappointed but this pool is every meaning of the word disappointment.."}
{"text":"I recently spent 5 days in this resort for a wedding. While this resort is beautiful and very clean we ended up with multiple issues that would prevent us from staying here again.   Pro's ------- - Large Clean rooms (large room and bathroom with deep soaking tub and separate shower) - Clean, comfortable, and quiet pool area (padded lounge chairs and excellent serving staff) - Friendly Staff ( main desk and cleaning staff was very friendly)  Con's -------- - Air Conditioning (even set at 60 degrees the room was very warm at all times probably sitting at around 75-80, many of the parties we traveled with reported the same issue. Many of us tried calling the desk for assistance but sadly the issue was never resolved) - Service (whether at the buffet or at some of the bars throughout the resort service tends to be slow and at times forgetful, waiting 25 minutes for creamer for coffee or a drink refill is crazy. The bar in the lobby need some serious help with speed also) - Casino (while beautiful most things seem to shut down early and table players will find there aren't many options from 12 am -12 pm)"}
{"text":"Why is it so difficult to cook bacon correctly? Today at the buffet, we are there three times a week, with a group, and the bacon was raw. Doesn't any one check? It is more raw than cooked!  Will be there again in a couple of days, will see if there is any improvement."}
{"text":"If you are looking to take the family on a little vacation to Las Vegas, Green Valley Ranch is definitely the place to go.  The resort is about a 15 minute cab ride from the strip.  The facility looks as if it has been recently remodeled, the rooms are spacious, clean and in great condition.  The bathrooms have a stand alone shower and a fabulous full size tub.  The staff is friendly and extremely helpful.  There is a ton of stuff to do without ever leaving the resort.  Compared to the prices of hotels on the strip this place is a steal for what you get.  They have a casino, restaurants, clubs, bars, pools and a spa and the prices are reasonable.  The resort is also just a quick 10 minute walk to the neighborhood restaurants and grocery store.  If you are looking for a place to stay in Vegas close enough to the strip but far away from the chaos....this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"This is the worst station casino I've seen a concert at in Vegas. Bathrooms are outside the venue so you have to go through a line again every time. Also, beer line takes an hour to go though. It was pathetic"}
{"text":"This casino has its advantages being 15 minutes away from the strip.  The traffic getting in and out of here is not bad at all nor is their an overcrowding issue inside the casino.  My family and I like to come here for the shopping, movies, and buffet.  The buffet is really a review in itself but to keep it short and sweet, it's pretty good and great variety of dishes to include s Mongolian BBQ station.  The cigarette smoke is my only complaint as some casinos have better ventilation than others.  Overall I always have a great experience at the green valley ranch casino and would recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Terrible local customer service. Beautiful resort and restaurants but they fail to take good care of locals. They used to cater for local ambition but lately they have been drawn in to becoming a resort i.e. MGm. It's sad to see it transition this way because I've been a fan since 2007 but with all the event bookings and over flow, gvr has now become a senseless strip hotel. Please bring back the station casinos that locals have gathered behind and we ll be there"}
{"text":"7-18-2015  I don't normally  write reviews for places that have been reviewed many times by others as I think it's redundant, but I recently ate lunch at Green Valley Ranch Buffet and was pleasantly surprised that the quality of the food was so much better than the other Station Casinos that I thought it deserved to be reviewed.  I visited on a Saturday and the Casino was very busy.  There was a line for the Buffet and it took about 20 minutes to get in.  I was seated and noticed that the chair was comfortable, something I hadn't noticed before.  I tried samples of various food.  The Chicken was cooked properly and had a good flavor.  The Mexican Rice was really good as was the taco meat, seasoned well and was tasty.  The BBQ sausage was good, and so were the BBQ Chicken Wings.  The BBQ Ribs were tender and tasty.  I had Apple Cobbler and Carrot Cake with frozen Vanilla Yogurt (Ice Cream?) on top.  The quality of everything I ate was better than what is served at other Station Casinos.  The service was good and my drink was filled as needed and dirty plates were removed in a timely manner.  The wait staff was busy but were friendly and asked me if I needed anything several times.  Sometimes it's the little things that make the difference or add to a pleasant dinning experience and I think GVR got it right this time."}
{"text":"I stay here often, the staff is very friendly. Nice, clean  rooms and big restrooms. Place to shop within walking distance. Several wonderful restaurants nearby if you get tired of the restaurants inside the property. Also, a whole foods across the street.  If you want all the party scene then you should stay on the strip but if you want peace and quiet, this is your place.  Restaurants: The buffet is very good with moderate pricing. If you gamble, you can use your points to pay for the meal.   Con's: This trip (9/3) they are doing a remodel, there was some noise but that to be expected. Air conditioning was turned down to 60 and eventually got to a comfortable temperature of about 75.  Gambling: Well it's the reason it's called gambling. However, 3 times I played max bet $3.75-$4.00, machine hit the bonus but only paid less than $50. Machines were very tight and payouts are better at other casino's. I prefer the M casino on slots.  Be careful with the resort fee anywhere that you stay in Vegas! Even if the room is a comp there might be a $14.50 resort fee. Just ask.  Internet was included in my stay this time but ended up charging me $12.99, I called the desk to reverse the charge.   Over all, this is where I like to stay, it's off the strip and close to everything I enjoy doing."}
{"text":"Nearing our check in date I received a personal email from the concierge which I thought was a very nice touch. It added to the excitement because this resort was talked up by my boyfriend who is from Henderson. Unfortunately, upon check in I was very disappointed at the lack of customer service. The person that checked us in was near the point of rude. I expect a high level of customer service at any hotel or restaurant and have an even higher one in a place like this. The front desk employee was robotic, not at all personable, did not explain any of the amenities, etc. The room was nice but our hallway smelled of sewage. Great bathtub!! Some of the waitstaff within the casino restaurants were snarky. The room service staff were great to interact with and the food was enjoyable (minus the Bloody Mary). I thought about mentioning something upon check out but we interacted with same front desk employee as when we checked in. Again, rude (if not ruder then before). She did not ask us how our stay was, explain any of the charges, and robotic. Overall it was an ok stay."}
{"text":"5 stars hands down. Stayed in the suite by the pool and it was awesome. Huge! Step down spa tubs, walk in showers, personal pool on the patio, pool table and digital hand held control of the entire room. Room service was impeccable, house keeping does a fantastic job on the rooms and make them look brand new everyday. Beds were perfectly comfortable and the couch was better than mine at home. Huge tv's and completely spacious thru the entire suite. Only issue I had was the fridge was a bit off but it was handled only moments after I let the front desk know of it. So I keep my 5 star review. This place is off the strip and perfect for those who value space and privacy and don't want to deal with the hustle and bustle of down town. Well worth the moderate price"}
{"text":"A very underrated casino and hotel.  A little off the beaten path, but great bars, spacious sportsbook, and a laid back pace.  Also super easy free parking!"}
{"text":"Love GVR. Good food, good pool, good sports book and have Kona Longboard on Tap!!"}
{"text":"This resort is absolutely incredible. As a local, I enjoy coming here for their restaurants which are excellent. They also have a movie theater (as do most resorts in Vegas), which is accessible without having to walk through the smoky casino floor (which is unlike most resorts in Vegas).  Staff is always friendly and willing to help and can provide great recommendations for lunch or dinner or any other need you may have.  I highly recommend this resort during the Christmas holiday since they setup an ice skating rink by their pool and sell Hot Cocoa, Apple Cider, and other holiday eats while you're getting your skate on!"}
{"text":"I don't like casinos and/or casino hotels, but I must admit, this hotel is one of the BEST hotels to stay at in Vegas. The rooms are extremely clean and neat, and if you're a hotel guest the spa area is free to use their basic services (sauna room, steam room, and a large jet spa - workout room too). They also offer massages and other fee based services as well. They have two pools to relax in, but I prefer their secluded rooftop pool in the spa area over the main pool downstairs. On the rooftop you can order drinks and food while you swim and/or relax in the sun."}
{"text":"Gotta be the best Stations Casino in Las Vegas!  Upscale, Inviting, & a very accommodating Hotel/Casino in Green Valley Ranch - Henderson, NV.  (10-15 minutes from the Las Vegas Airport)  The Hotel is excellent. Beds are super comfortable. Rooms are large and comfortable.  Mini-fridge is stocked and ready for a party.   The pool is very nice! And the spa is incredible. Gotta be the best Spa in Vegas.   The Casino is awesome! Large casino floor with tons of modern games and table games. Poker room is always packed. Sports Book is great - large with a VIP lounge as well. And you can't beat the $0.99 Margaritas at the sports bar.   Shopping and dining around the area is great too! The District is across the street from the Hotel (Shopping District with Restaurants).   If you want to be off the strip in an upscale area, Green Valley Ranch Hotel & Casino is a wonderful option!"}
{"text":"Fun, fun, fun...because I won! I was extremely lucky on the blazing 7's! I hit 7 7 7 about 3-4 times., winning $200-$300 for each match!  Anyway, this casino is pretty nice. The crap tables were super full when my bf and I were there. And I noticed there were a lot of old people around. I guess this casino is where all the old folk go to get craazzzzyyyyy.  After I won, i was walking around looking for some place to get me a latte. No such luck because Coffee Bean was already closed. Boo you Coffee Bean, boo you.   I'm looking forward to stopping by this casino again for more blazing 7's fun."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience here. The first night there was no water all night! Like until the next morning! That meant no brushing teeth, no flushing toilet, no shower. No apology from them. No compensation. No heads-up before booking. They had provided two bottles of water but each was $8. So, no thanks.  No microwave. Most hotels provide one when requested, but not this one. They charge extra for microwave and fridge.  There was no coffee maker.  We were told the check out was at 11 AM. When we requested a noon checkout, the guy made all sorts of excuses and declined. Later another person from the front desk said the actual checkout was 12. So, thanks for the false information.   We paid $25 mandatory resort fee, which clearly said it included internet. By that what they meant was extremely slow internet for emails. For YouTube and Netflix, or high speed internet, there was an additional charge. On top of the $25 mandatory fee.  Staying so far away from the strip, you would expect better.  I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"If you want a successful small to medium business conference away from the distractions of the strip, look no further than GVR.  We considered multiple properties for our event, and GVR staff went above and beyond to get our business, not to mention that this property is perfect for a wide range of demographics. The theme is Tuscany, and the decor is subtle and contemporary. There is even a small vineyard in the courtyard.  It has all the right Vegas ingredients: modern pool are with a bar and cabanas, beautiful and delicious restaurants, large casino...but without the craziness of the strip. Of course, if the mood strikes, you can always venture out to the strip (we did one night), but GVR has everything you need for a proper Vegas vacation in one place.  I will address some highlights:  - Pool Area: plenty of comfortable lounge chairs, opium style beds and cabanas. Cute servers, eager and ready to bring you the next beverage of choice.  - SPA & Fitness Center: Plenty of cardio machines, free weights and even some pl yos tools. It has it's own outdoor pool with covered lounges and a hot tub. Beautiful locker rooms. Complimentary towels, water and pool time ;-)   - Casino: not as big as other resorts on the strip, but large enough to have all the games you can think of, including sports betting area and a poker room as well as high rollers lounge. They also still have $5 bets for black jack and roulette...which is hard to find on the strip.  - Restaurants: We tried them all, and they were all very good. Steak, sushi, seafood bar, Italian - whatever your palate is in the mood for.  - Rooms: Get a view of the pool area. Rooms are spacious with large full size bathrooms complete with a glass shower and a soaking tub, even a small linen closet. There is also a vanity are in the hallway, which I loved using to get ready in the am.  Staff was always helpful and courteous!   I will be back at GVR  P.S. GVR offers complimentary shuttle to and from the airport as well as to and from the main Vegas strip. Time slots are limited, but be sure to inquire about it when you book your reservations."}
{"text":"My husband and I opted to do a Staycation at Green Valley Ranch since we were going to the 3 Doors Down concert at their events center which was absolutely fantastic.  We've stayed at GVR several times previously and have always had a pleasant stay however, I believe it's about time they updated their décor--the room we stayed in had an old musty yellow color pallet that reminded me of something you'd find in your great grandparents house. And some of the furniture looked worn and needing replacing. Even so, it was still a nice room with a view of the pool & spa area and  a very  comfortable bed. The only thing that really caused me dismay was a couple of partially dried urine drops on the toilet seat. Since I've never encountered such an issue before while staying at GVR I tried to dismiss it as a uncommon oversight.   Prior to the concert we enjoyed a 50 minute couples massage at their spa and dinner at Hanks (which was certainly not our best experience at the restaurant).   After the concert we enjoyed a nice peaceful night's sleep even though we were very close to the elevators. The next morning we ordered room service--they were very prompt and the breakfast was very enjoyable. My husband opted for French toast while I had the avocado & crab omelet.   Although it was a quick mini vacation it was relaxing- but certainly would have enjoyed staying snuggled up in bed longer."}
{"text":"This was my first time at GVR.  I have heard a lot about it but never had the time to go. I liked it because it wasnt as packed and smokey as the casinos on the strip.  I think more locals and out of towners that are looking for a nice evening or day at the pool come here.   They have a large variety of places to eat, some fancy, some casual!   I came here for a work event and we used the private bar/pool cabana.  It was great!!  TV's, open bar, a beautiful pool that was not heated but was a perfect temp for a hot day!   The open pool area was just as nice.  I will be returning to enjoy more pool time and great food!"}
{"text":"Minus one star, $28 resort fee, wtf, highway robbery!  And where did Original Pancake house go?  Still a gorgeous resort, very beautiful grounds and pool area.  Awesome room and toiletries.  I love being far from the strip, much more relaxing.  Please management reconsider the steep resort fee!!"}
{"text":"I recently spent 4 days here attending a conference.  The conference staff does a great job putting on events.  I've attended many conferences here and they've always kept the service levels very high.  During one of the lunches during the program, they served a Cheese Ravioli which was amazing...yum! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/green-valley-ranch-resort-and-spa-henderson-2?select=YoRrgRX9pDs_3uj-RhMKnw#YoRrgRX9pDs_3uj-RhMKnw  During this particular conference I also stayed in the hotel.  The rooms are well appointed and the bed is very comfortable.  The pillows are large and soft and you feel like you're falling asleep on a cloud.  Needless to say, I slept very well that week. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/green-valley-ranch-resort-and-spa-henderson-2?select=umFvzSSloFFPxmfHAkghpA#umFvzSSloFFPxmfHAkghpA  The casino was very slow the days I stayed here, which was in the middle of the week.  It looked like a ghost town.  Not much going on at the bars/lounges either.  Hank's Steakhouse has awesome desserts (see other review) and the Cafe was terrible (see other review).  Overall, it was a great place to stay with hit/miss food options.  Return Factor - 82%"}
{"text":"Did not have a good experience at Green Valley Ranch.  The premesis are beautiful but that's where it's allure ends.  First off, we were ripped off by some hidden $30 a night Resort Fee which they didn't tell us about when we booked.  What were we supposed to do, refuse our nonrefundable room after we had already driven 6 hours to Vegas?  Nice scam. You got us! I could have stayed at a nicer hotel closer to the strip for what I paid including the hidden ripoff scam resort fees.  Second, I'd requested a nonsmoking room. We walked in and right away we wanted to vomit, because it smelled like smoke. You aren't going to trick a nonsmoker. We KNOW when someone has been smoking. All you are going to do is waste our time and yours by trying to pull that on us.  When the bellhop came to give us new keys, he didn't even make sure we got to the new room or knew where to go. He pointed in some direction and then left. He was very rude.  The pool burned my eyes. Usually you have a strong odor or stinging sensation when they put too much clorine in. But after 90 minutes in uncomfortably COLD water at their pool (how you manage COLD water when its 105 out is beyond me) I got out and my vision was completely blurry. Someone told me it was \"chlorine burn\". This is very dangerous to have something in the water which affects your eyes so badly and yet is undetectible. I had halos and fuzzy vision for the next 12 hours. I have never had that problem ever in my life and I am practically a fish, diving in the ocean, pools, etc quite often. Their pool is dangerous. Don't expect to be driving or going anywhere afterwards until your eyes are normal.  Their drinks are a RIP OFF. They tried to charge me $28 for two weak, small pina coladas at the pool. When I questioned them they changed the price to $21 because \"I didn't get the puree\", whatever the hell that means. They tried to pull fast one #2 on me. Or are we at #3 now?  The cleaning lady was very nice. They must treat her horribly and completely overwork her. Because when I let her into my room and all she had to change were the towels (I'm a dude, what do we need room cleaning for?) she bowed at me and said thank you like I was some great, merciful master or something. Treat your cleaning people better!  We checked for bedbugs. Didn't see any signs in the sheets but my friend had bites a couple days later.  Overall I had a very negative experience with this hotel. Unless you like being ripped off, nickled and dimed to death with hidden fees, and treated poorly, I highly suggest you stay far away from this hotel."}
{"text":"I recently stayed here for the week and have absolutely no complaints:)  In fact, I just booked my next reservation in a couple of weeks.  Everyone that works here from the front desk girls to the valet boys, so nice and welcoming, also very helpful! My room was very clean and comfortable, I love that theres sound in the BR from the tv so I can get ready and hear the Today show:)  My only regret is that I was unable to take advantage of the AMAZING pool while I was there...it is beautiful!!!  When it warms up I will definitely be there:)"}
{"text":"I really liked this casino and the surrounding area.   Easy parking - shopping and food in the outdoor mall surrounding it - and a nice large casino with a parking garage attached.  So you can shop at the outdoor mall, eat, then gamble, or just visit to gamble and park right beside the entrance to the casino.   The casino is well-kept, clean, modern and has tons of machines and tables inside as well as live entertainment and live gaming.  I had a blast here and actually preferred this more \"local\" casino to the ones I've always haunted on the strip in previous visits."}
{"text":"Woo hoo! Yes, this place is fun, fun, fun, and add a little bit more fun to that! This place is gorgeous, classy, expensive, and just plain fun. Greeted at the front door with all smiles. I stayed in a suite right next door to Michael's Jackson's suite (Whiskey Suite). The room was clean, fancy, and very accommodating to my family's needs. We had a pool view plus a view of the mountains. Absolutely beautiful!  The pool is huge, and there is more than enough seating. The casino offered things for kids and adults. There were plenty of quick places to eat food (food court), and bars plus restaurants. Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Everything is spread out and especially the pool! They have a huge casino on one floor. I'm from California so this review is not for the gamblers and stay up all night all day goers. We stayed here for a business conference for 2 nights and one day.   Blueprint: This place is not as easy to find if you are generally coming from the street. We saw the outside Casino and assuming the Lobby is constructed from where you would enter. Since this set up with an east tower and west tower, the lobbies are at two different locations.  We stayed at the east tower. We arrived at 330am and I was exausted. It didn't help it took 30 minutes to figure out where our room was.   Decor: The decor has a western type ranch feel thus the name of the location. They have an amazing pool and patio area. Their was a wedding going on, the weather was gorgeous so I took lots of pictures here.   Notes: Huge food court Amazing patio great room service Great rates  I would definitely come back here to stay if I was off the strip."}
{"text":"Found a great deal last minute online.  This bed is so comfy and everything smells super clean.  I love the landscaping and pool area.  It's too cold this time of year for me to go swimming but I can appreciate how luxe this place is for how much of a discount we got the room for.  Deff worth staying off the strip. Super nice staff too."}
{"text":"This is an upscale hotel with many amenities. The staff are super pro and very attentive. Definitely coming back whenever I'm in Henderson."}
{"text":"Use your players card, I think you get a slight discount at the buffet.  Similar to M Hotel, if you like to have a drink or two while your gambling, this is sort of a destination resort/casino rather than one you can go into and then wonder into a neighboring casino. Set off all my it's lonesome, it is a nice casino with fairly friendly dealers and cage personnel. It is much more of a locals casino (because of it's location) but they don't shun or mistreat visitors (as they need our money too).  Nice buffet, they also have a food court, good sized sports book and all the slot machines you could ever ask for. There are enough table games to fill your curiosity (although not a large number of tables) and enough room inside to easily walk around when you need a break.  We plan on staying there next time we're in town to see how the rooms and hotel service is for us out of towners.  If you go, hope you win, good luck!"}
{"text":"Would give it zero stars  if I could this place is just a horrible casino kiosk always broken then you ask for help and it's another nightmare for a local spot they should try harder but I guess that's just too much like right"}
{"text":"When we checked in it was almost midnight on a Monday of long tarveling. Went to the room and tried to check email.  Internet did not work. This place charges a Resort Fee, (basically for a nice pool) the in room WI-Fi was supposed to be included in the $29 a day Resort Fee, upon loging into the WIFI it says if you want the BETTER COX BROADBAND that will cost $18 a day more!!! The other was at  modem speed  or no speed all the time i tried it in my room. Went out to get some bottled water and find wifi at the McDonalds down the road (free)   Came back and asked the front desk to fix it or upgrade me to the one that worked. THEY DID NOT DO ANYTHING. I aske them to have the  General Manager call me he never did.  I asked 2 more times for him to call me over the 5 days there he never called me, I even left my cell number twice! Went to the front desk and asked to meet the GM on the last day and he said the internet worked. I did a speed test in front of him and he said that it does not work in the common areas. IT DOES NOT WORK ANYWHERE. NEVER AGAIN, I would stay off sight if there is a chance to stay away from this over priced Motel 6. It was amazing that others in my Convention Group said the Internet was no good,  This place needs new ownership! I guess what happens in Vegas can be talked about HMMM"}
{"text":"First time here, the resort is beautiful and perfect if you are from Vegas wanting a \"staycation\" away from the strip.  Their man made beach/pool is perfect for the kids, no hoochie mamas prancing around the pool. The reason why I'm giving them 4 stars is because check in is supposedly at 3pm, well I went there at 3pm to check in and I was told my room wasn't ready, however, it would be ready between 3-5pm!!! What the heck!  I did not get called until about 415ish to get the key card to our room.  So my advice to you is to call ahead of time to avoid this delay.   All in all, my family 2 adults and 2 kids, had a great time at the resort.  We made use of the pool that accommodated our \"family\".  We will definitely be back again during the summer season."}
{"text":"When we first checked in to our room the shower and toilet clogged.  Then the next day it was 110 degrees and we were in the pool and everyone had to get out at 2. Then the next morning the electricity was out in our room and we can't get late check out even though the bathroom is pitch black. My mom also checked in and requested a non smoking room and they said they were too full and gave her a smoking room.  One of the worst experiences I've had at a hotel. Ready to get out of here."}
{"text":"Hotel is nice. The pool is closed during construction and In the winter. The spa pool and steam room is available to hotel guests. It is worth it and amazing. Favorite part of the trip for sure! We stayed in the resort the entire trip, no need to go to the strip. There's no dancing or night life but the happy hour at Hank's was great. Dirty and pear martini's were excellent and strong. The staff their do not crack smiles not even a little bit. We would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Have never stayed but play the slots once a month or so. Not bad at all, good new machines. The nice upscale bar int he middle of casino floor is real fun. Good buffett also."}
{"text":"The buffet is always good best place to eat but cashing your check just make sure you don't get Imelda. I've tried to have patience but she always questions my checks even tho I'm using the same company every other week. Now I'm sure everyone checks. Why do you ask me if its the same place and then ask to check. If your not taking my word for it then don't even ask just check your slow and it's frustrating. If it wasn't for them having a good buffet I would be giving a 1 star.   And the casino is always clean love it!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful resort, tucked away from the strip, has all the amenities you would want and located next to a bunch of restaurants and stores!   When I've stayed here for work, I've typically only observed the staff in the morning and late evenings when I'm around. They've been really wonderful! There are some restaurants on premises which you can eat at or go to the walking distance restaurants/shops."}
{"text":"This place is overall pretty nice and very accommodating in the varieties of places to dine, gambling selections, and comps.  They used to give a lot more comps away in the mail, but I guess tough times don't allow the extras anymore.  The Feast buffet is nice and has a pretty good selection of food.  The Regal movies are real nice and have stadium seating.  The gaming tables are good and have a good selection of table games.  Should definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Clean and super poshy. Front desk agents were extremely helpful. Amenities good. Definitely worth the money and will definitely return"}
{"text":"This is a great change of pace from the hustle and bustle of the strip. Really beautiful surrounding, wonderful shops, and friendly staff. Had fun playing bingo here..Okay it did help that I won, but still would have liked this place regardless!"}
{"text":"nice and cozy! its actually one of the rare hotels in  the area thats not \"intoxicated\" by cigarette  smell and smoke! we tried the buffet because we were too tired to go out for dinner that night... i do not recommend the buffet at all. the food has no flavor at all! i m really not a big fan of buffet style because i privilege quality than quantity but that one was one of the worst one... not even the veggies and fruits taste right... i enjoyed the apple turnover at the grand cafe way better than the entire buffet! so i would recommend to eat at the grand cafe next door than at the buffet."}
{"text":"As a chairman at Station Casinos I like to send my family to them for regular spa services on special occasions...Unfortunately their food and beverage person, Ann Padilla was SO RUDE and terribly unprofessional in dealing with a situation involving my in laws that we will NEVER be back! Shame on you for treating people with such disrespect, Ms. Padilla. I believe you are in the wrong business and hope that whoever is above you knows you are solely responsible for losing our business as well as my families, whom are also chairmen!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It is clean and very nice inside. The buffet here can't be beat!! It is such a good deal and the food is outstanding. I have never stayed here overnight but I plan to soon!"}
{"text":"They have air conditioning. That's a plus. We came in searching for my friends slot machine that he helped design.. It wasn't there.   typical casino thoroughfare, aging grandmothers, spending their offspring's inheritance on a few hours of fun on the penny slots. thankfully it's not smoke filled, the ventilation is adequate. However, you could still smell the crushed dreams and feel the majority's inability to truly understand the math behind probability and odds.  But that's neither here nor there."}
{"text":"Beautiful hotel and casino.  The rooms are very nice.  Their pool, The Pond, is a fun hangout spot and their spa is a great place to go for pedi's and mani's.  If you're a local you get 20% off."}
{"text":"Had been going there for years loved there concerts and poker room.  Last trip took my grandma for her 90th bday she broke her shoulder tripping over a pillow left on the floor because the light switch did not turn the lights on.  Needless to say she never got to enjoy her bday and was taken to the hospital by ambulance.  Next day heard nothing from hotel re: my gma not is she ok or anything.  Terrible service.  Don't believe in lawsuits or they would have one.  Thank goodness her surgery went well but will not be back.  Told them to quit sending their overpriced \"deals\" but keep getting them.  Too bad used to really like this place but now gotta find somewhere new!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to let local know. GVR has lower their local discount to 25% from 30%. Monday to Friday. Great service."}
{"text":"I love GVR! Shopping, dining, movies, dancing & a spa...what more can you ask for? I've gone for birthday celebrations, family supper, date nights, movies, poolside play, shopping, truck or treating & spa days! And it's OFF The Strip & less than a mile from home. Visiting friends & family are never disappointed when we go there instead of downtown! The only thing they could add is a children's area....like Town Square....only better!  ;)"}
{"text":"We were meeting friends for dinner, so we went a bit early and played some video poker until it was time to meet.  The casino is a pleasant enough place.  It's laid out conveniently from the 21 parking deck to get to the casino and the buffet.  My only negative about the place was in the bank I was playing, there were a couple of machines that had maintenance issues.  Is the management aware that a machine that refuses to accept cash or TITOs is not much of a grosser for the casino?  I was ready to give up and go to the Sports Book and watch a game when one machine finally decided take my money for play.  I hope they get to these machines and don't let more slip into disrepair.  To me, that's a sign of sloppy management which one sees evidenced in other aspects of the property.  Come on GVR, get on the ball!  On a very positive note, the cocktail waitress was around 3 times in the brief time I was playing.  She knew how to do the job pleasantly and well!"}
{"text":"Loved our stay here! The resort is beautiful & huge. The front desk staff were friendly and efficient. The guy at the bell desk was funny and helpful. The fitness center was clean and perfect for our needs. We appreciated the fridge full of cold water. They have a variety of restaurants (we tried pizza rock and tides and liked both). They are across the street from a long row of shops. The casino is very smoky. We would suggest making a smoking room and a nonsmoking room. If nothing else you should install glass between the casino and restaurants so you don't have to eat in a smoky atmosphere. The pool area is great...love the very padded lounge chairs, the misters to cool you off, and the outdoor beds on the upper level. The only downside about the pool was that the lifeguards on the lifeguard chair seemed more interested in looking at their phones than actually watching the pool. The server at the pool in the cute teal bikini was very nice. Our room was nice and mostly clean, my only suggestion would be to bleach and scrub the grout on the shower & bathroom floor. The shuttle to the strip was convenient, but the driver lady was very curt and seemed annoyed that people actually got on the shuttle. Overall we had a really good time and would absolutely come back!"}
{"text":"It's like paradise here! Gym was rad! The steam rooms out by the heated pool feel like your in  a steamy Amazonian Rain Forest with these tropical and tea aromas intoxicating your entire body! Went down stairs and had an indoor heated jacuzzi with a side door open to the cool breeze rushing in from the waterfall fountain from outside. Probably drank the best hot tea in my life there! The showers were all stone with a waterfall shower head that was massive and just poured! All I had to do was bring my body and everything else was provided! So good!!"}
{"text":"Really terrific Seafood Buffet on Friday. Really excellent variety of food and an enjoyable atmosphere overall."}
{"text":"Amazing place to stay. Spent 4 nights here and I really enjoyed the whole vibe there. The rooms are comfy and amazing. They have some of the best food establishments I've ever had while traveling. Pizza rock for example.. yum. The entire staff was friendly and very hospitable. Overall I would love to visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"The epitome of a classier \"locals\" hotel/casino in Las Vegas is Green Valley Ranch! It's been a little bit since my last stay at GVR, but certainly nothing has changed at the Italian themed resort! From the moment you walk in the main lobby you notice the classy Italian decor! You find yourself walking throughout the resort saying to yourself, \"this is beautiful\"! It's on the upper end for a locals hotel stay in price, as you'd normally expect to pay in the $150 per night neighborhood. The buffet here is definitely a step up from the normal off strip casinos. The desserts and Sunday brunch are without doubt their best features on the buffet for the price! Perhaps the best feature at GVR is the pool! It's a fairly large pool with a sand bottom that gradually ends on a small beach! There are small separate wading pools that surround the main pool for the adults to enjoy without the kids! Since it's a locals casino, just remember to get your \"players card\" to save on dining options and many other resort amenities! GVR has a nice bingo parlor and a super nice movie theater for your family's enjoyment! Located next to a nice shopping district, GVR is safe for you and your kids as the clientele is a bit better than typical off strip locations!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing one night stay! Staff is great here and the West Tower rooms are HUGE and comfy. When they brought up my luggage from the bell desk, they even filled my ice-bucket and explained all the amenities. Entertainment in the Ovation Lounge is top notch and they have a Fatburger in the food court."}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed here, and were impressed. As someone who has stayed exclusively on the Strip during every other Vegas stay I was apprehensive about staying this far out.  The rooms are fantastic. They are large and well appointed. The casino was was well laid out. I play craps and there were plenty of tables at very reasonable mins. The pool was great lots of seating with attentive waitstaff.  I was surprised at the amount of kids on the property i was not aware this was family oriented. Still a very wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Nice casino... during the day it is a much older crowd.  They have their regulars, however I think the staff (dealers and pit supervisors) needs to be friendlier... They seem so grouchy and hate their jobs.  On the brighter side... I like that they have contests and drawings on weekends.. What a way to grab locals to this joint.  Also, get that paigow progressive!"}
{"text":"Green Valley Ranch is absolutely amazing it creates the allusion that guests and visitors are staying at some villa in Italy or France. Walking through the resort is so beautiful with light fixtures that deliver light beautifully. I was impressed with the casino gambling decor as well, where in there are lots of machines but their arrangements are not cluttering as one passes through the hotel. Everything about this hotel is extravagant.  I have been to this hotel in the past, today I was attending an event and it could not of been at a better place. The meeting space that was extended to us was very warm and had ample lighting. The space was filled with water as requested. After the event we all went to Borrachos Cantina for drinks and dinner."}
{"text":"I have come here several times. The buffet is really good. Usually if you get there before noon the line is not to bad. The assortment of food is not bad at all. The poker room is the best in the area. The locals hang out here and the dealers are friendly. The best part of the room is Tammy. She was helpful and a delight."}
{"text":"Great movies great food very much enjoy coming here when i body my friends that live on this side of town. Shopping centers all around. Probably the best nectvto Red rock and the palms casinos for station"}
{"text":"In the last 2 years, I've probably only been here 3 times.  However, when they first opened up (before the District was built), I was here all the time.  In those 10+ years, my opinion about GVR has changed. GVR is still one of those quiet casinos that's still a nice one, but must air must not be circulated correctly because for a luxury looking Station Casino, it sure smelled like an old Fremont type casino.  In other words, the stench of smoke is all over the place.  I use to think GVR was huge, but now think it's just average.  I was recently here to play a little poker and the games weren't as good as they are at Red Rock.  Games weren't even as good as the Golden Nugget.  Even the buffet has slipped in the last couple of years.    I love the Station Casinos because they love their locals.  But when it comes to the Green Valley Ranch, I never seem to get any deals (i.e. comps, free rooms, free meals, etc) like I do at the other Station Casinos.  Maybe it's because I don't play here and spend enough money here.  All I know is that it's doesn't have that luster it first had when they opened 10+ years ago.  Overall, GVR is just okay.    PS:  GVR still have fireworks during the 4th of July.  The show is actually pretty good, but it's also far from the other casinos/resorts. If you make your way out here, all you really have is GVR."}
{"text":"Great Property - Crappy Service  Main problems  - Unsatisfactory front desk especially the check in / check out process and the lack of courteousness of the staff.   The check in process took way too long, over 45 minutes. The front desk person, fiddled on the computer left the desk to check on something not once but twice, then told us we would be upgraded to a suite for one night of our stay with a king size bed & a roll out serta cot, then need to switch rooms the next day.  Neither my colleague or I wanted to sleep on a roll out or transfer rooms the next day so the front desk person left the area again & asked for a manager to speak with us. After waiting another 10 minutes, the manager came out & told us how lucky we were that a room had just become available & we would not need to switch rooms after all.  Please note - that this is the room which we had reserved almost 3 months ago. The manager did not apologize for the delays or inconvenience. But at any rate, 45 minutes later we were finally off to our rooms with no help or offer of bellhop to help us find our way.   We also had a very long & delayed check out, where the front desk person again left & went to the back area more than once without explaining anything to us. The billing was done incorrectly & I was over charged for the stay twice, which I found out when I viewed my credit card statement after arriving home. I was able to resolve the over charginging situation.    Oversll , I was very disappointed in these factors of my stay & do not feel that the resort lived up to expectations."}
{"text":"This lovely resort has the best customer service ever! Every single employee makes you feel special and they all cater to you in a way that is so genuine! Loved it And can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"To be honest, this hotel majorly sucks.  The website states and I quote: \"Luxurious and affordable...\"  True, it is luxurious. Affordable? In my plain-spoken opinion, no.  It really is over-rated when people say 'affordable', it's a matter of perspective.   From a family perspective, dealing with three children, it isn't affordable.  The massages here literally run into the hundreds, just for one hour to eighty minutes.  I can get the same type of massage near home for just twenty dollars an hour.  I can get five massages back home for the prices they offer here.  It's so bogus.     There is a certain factor of timing as well, we probably chose a bad time to go to the Resort because there's an event going on in the pool right now; which puts a curfew into play.  We're trapped inside our rooms, we can't get through the central promenade.  You have to pay like $14+ for generic wifi. Food here is hella expensive.  Massages are hella expensive.  It feels like a beautiful prison. We are in a prison, God save our souls.    Aside from the crappy, misleading claims that the website states and the prison-like regulations the service here is really bomb.  The staff here is really young and they act very fast and efficiently.  The only reason why I'm giving this place two stars is because of the service, not the place itself; the sheer joy of loving service, it's something I respect.       Will I come back here? Personally, no.  I would stay at the strip if I were smarter, get closer to the action.  Green Valley Ranch was a huge waste of my time and effort.      Excuse me if I offended anybody's opinion, it's just this place was one of the most irritating Resorts I have ever been to in my lifetime."}
{"text":"I'm torn on how to rate this hotel.   On the one hand:  It's nice. Really nice. The rooms are spacious and the beds are comfy and the bathrooms are beautiful.  The pool area is absolutely gorgeous. I would have loved to have been there when it was warmer as I'm sure the pool is packed and really fun. The spa area is nice (though I didn't use it) and the workout room is huge, with tons of new machines. The staff was friendly, and the cocktail servers in the casino were quick. Breakfast in the main restuarant was good, and only about $18 for 2. the Irish pub was great with a friendly bartender and really reasonably priced drinks and daily specials. They also have an OHOP, an Italian restaurant, a movie theatre and several clubs. And there is a Whole Foods about a 10 minute walk away.  The casino isn't that big, but it was never very crowded. The conference rooms were really nice as well.   On the other hand: The sushi resturant was ridiculously overpriced. $10 for 2 pieces of salmon sushi? I know it's Vegas but come on. The buffet looked like more quantity than quality, and the halibut I ordered from room service was bland and overcooked.  But my biggest gripe was the shuttle service. I was told there was free shuttle service to and from the airport and the strip. I arrive at 5 on Friday - no shuttle until 7pm. Saturday the first shuttle to the strip was at 1pm. Monday when my husband left for the airport at 8am and Wednesday when I left at 6:30 there was no shuttle. The first one isn't until 9am. Over 4 days we spent over $150 on cabs due to the inconvenient and infrequent shuttle service. Plus, the shuttle only seats 14 people so more than once I saw someone turned away.  When I checked out, I noticed that I was charged $20 more per night than what was advertised for my conference rate. I emailed the manager and he refunded me the $100 so the customer service was very good.   I guess, if you are really looking to get away and relax, hang by the pool, do a bit of gambling, and aren't looking to hang out much on the strip or stick to a budget, this is great hotel. It's gorgeous and the pool area is beautiful. But if you really want to be on the strip and don't have a ton of money to spend on food and cabs, you might end up disappointed."}
{"text":"My Husband and I are locals who needed a little staycation to relax and regroup. We chose GBR after attending a recent event here thinking the pool looked beautiful and a perfect spot to park our weary butts for a couple of days. We were not disappointed!!! We were upgraded to a suite in the East Tower, a beautiful room overlooking the pool area. The staff here took very good care of us and a big shout out to Alicia, a server at the pool, who never let our drinks run dry! I will definitely be back and will recommend GVR to friends and family in the future."}
{"text":"Overall, this is a fine resort with a couple of gotchas.  And although I've only given it three stars, I would seriously consider staying here again.  My initial impression of Green Valley Ranch is not a good one.  We regretfully did not read reviews of the resort here on yelp until the morning we left.  This is when we discovered that the GVR shuttle service should be spelled with an 'i' where the 'u' goes in the word 'shuttle'.  We arrived the same night as the Country Music Awards and some major commercial real-estate convention was in town.  Transportation was difficult to come by, but we lucked into a town car.  There is no GVR shuttle past 9 PM.  Now, just to show I don't endlessly complain, I'm going to tell GVR how to fix their shuttle service.  So, random GVR drone, when you come to read the reviews on yelp and discover that you have two negative reviews because your guests don't like their fellow patrons, a persecuted teenager, a woman with what seems like something akin to a serious beef with GVR, and damn near every positive review mentions your \"shuttle\" \"service\", take heed and book a stay at the Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego.  I honeymooned there a couple of years ago, and while the Hotel Del does a lot of things I rather they wouldn't do (nickel and diming takes on a whole new meaning there), they will come get you from the airport.  For a fee, of course, because everything there comes with a fee.  Except, oddly, the wi-fi, which we'll get to later in the case of GVR.  Now, if GVR were to have a couple or four vans to take people and their luggage to and from the airport for a modest per-person fee, I'm thinking more than a few people might utilize the service.  I think you would quite likely turn a good profit on the service.  One of the most annoying things about the shuttle was that the front-desk staff seemed to be genuinely surprised when I informed them that GVR's shuttle was next to worthless.  I wonder if they've ever tried to use it.  Speaking of the desk staff, I want to point out to every future guest that reads this review that there is no such thing in the hospitality industry as 'reserved'.  Hoteliers are notoriously greedy -- there's a song in the Les Miserables musical that isn't so much satire as it is methodology, and this is demonstrated in spades in the affinity hotel staff, particulary those at GVR, have of telling you that you indeed have a room with a certain bed configuration waiting for your arrival, when in fact, they could care less.  My wife does not appreciate being lied to, GVR.  If you can't reserve a particular thing for us, say so.  Almost everything else at GVR went off without a hitch.  We ate at Feast (their buffet), the Grand Cafe (open all night) and the Original Pancake House.  We also ate several catered meals.  All of the food was excellent, but some of the waitstaff for the catered events frequently seemed overwhelmed by their duties.  The people I met working the bar (Joe and Tiffany, if I recall correctly) at the Grand Cafe were the best that GVR has to offer, hands down.  Incidentally, the Grand Cafe's breakfasts tend to run cheaper than the Original Pancake House's.  We sat by the pool for part of the last full day there.  It was hard to schedule pool time with my wife, who was sitting in traning sessions in the Estancia ballrooms all day, because the pool closes at 6 PM.  This seems arbitrarily early, and appears to me to be more likely as a tactic to drive people into the casino in the evening.  I'm not impressed.  Be the resort -- keep it open until at least 7 PM at least in the warmer months.  I can't imagine that will ever happen though, because of the greed mentioned above and because of the casino acting upon that greed.  Speaking about greed, let's mention the casino.  My only gripe about the casino is this:  Nevada law says that I can't take my 4 month old son in the gaming area.  I have no problem with this, especially as there are handy maps posted with marked walkways that children can walk along.  The problem is that the casino manager has decided that those walkways would be excellent places to put slot machines!  Dumb, just dumb.  It's never, ever, a good idea into forcing your patrons to be lawbreakers.  Finally, why do I have to pay thirteen bucks a day for internet?  There's a Panera right over there, and their wi-fi is free.  Making hotel guests in a hotel this expensive pay for wi-fi is just plain dumb.  The beds are comfy.  I don't do hard beds, but that one was quite nice.  The bathroom was spacious and luxurious.  Everything was well-maintained and clean.  The housekeeping staff was always very courteous and helpful.  Bottom line: be aware that GVR's management's interests are not necessisarily yours.  They do provide a good room, great food and nice accommodations.  The shopping area outside is nice.    It's a good place to go if you don't expect too much from your high-priced megaresort."}
{"text":"If you want an overpriced, older casino hotel with lots of hidden charges and crappy restaurants, this is the place for you.  Where should I begin:  First, Green Valley Ranch Resort is NOT really a resort. There is no golfing for example although they do have a spa and gym.  Secondly, everything is pricey. I order a plain salmon dinner for room service. It wasn't fancy and wasn't especially large in portion size.   The price was over $40. They not only jack up the price from that of the restaurant but also charge both a service charge and gratuity. What a rip?  Third: They charge a whopping $100 per day as a resort fee? There is no golf here that I can see , so what is this for? Answer; A money grab.  They don't even give you fast internet. You have to pay to upgrade to fast internet despite paying a $100 a day resort fee.   Fourth: the condition of the casino and rooms are just ok. Everything is a bit dated and old.  There is no shiny entertainment as you would see on the strip or fancy rooms, although the bathrooms were a bit larger than I normally expect.  Fifth: none of the restaurants were ether fancy or modern. They were just some side venue where you can get something to eat.   The good news , however , is that the staff is very courteous and friendly. They have to be considering that we are getting ripped off.  Bottom line: You might be able to get some decent room rates but watch out for the extras such as the large resort fee and internet charges."}
{"text":"The Spa is excellent with friendly staff.  HOWEVER, during one of my several stays at the resort, I thought long distance calling was included in the $24.99 resort fee.  I called my cell phone to find it (thought it dropped out of my pocket) and then checked voicemail on my cell phone which I accidentally left in the car at valet.  Total talk time: 4 minutes on 2 calls.  Total bill for it $20+.  I explained my mistake/situation to Manager, Chris (Hochman?)   He adamantly refused to reduce the charges to something in line with reality.  I would gladly pay $1 per minute, but he refused.  He admitted that he has the power and discretion to provide a credit but refused.  Now they will lose my business and advocacy.  I loved this place.  Now I am telling people:  DO NOT GO THERE!"}
{"text":"The room had a TV not working and plug sockets that were not working. After engineering fixed the TV, the sockets needed an electrician that couldn't come for a couple days.  I asked for an upgrade after being offered an increased price at check in for an upgrade. The manager would not give us this upgraded room but offered the same room.  I was disappointed to not be given an upgrade after having several issues with a room that was not in working order.   The \"best she could do\" was offer a similar room.   The gym doesn't open until 6:00 and I waited as they were late to open.    I would stay on the strip with better accommodations and customer service for the price."}
{"text":"So my friend had a conference here and asked me to join her for some weekend fun. When I heard it was located off the strip I'll admit I wasn't too excited. But when I showed up I was pleasantly surprised - this place is actually really nice!  First of all, they do offer a free airport shuttle but only at specific times of the day so if you don't time it right you may be out of luck. Luckily my plane landed at just the right time to catch a ride. The shuttle was like a little bus so it was comfy and the ride wasn't too long.  Like most places in Vegas, this place is huge. It's got a big casino, tons of rooms and a really big pool area. The room was really nice, clean and quiet. The bathroom was gigantic. And the bed was really comfy.  The pool area was nice - lots of chairs and umbrellas. But the best part was a little ways off the pool they have these big bed-type structures that are awesome! I want one of these for my own backyard. I could hang out there all day.  The only real bummer was that their strip shuttle only runs until 8:30pm. Who comes back from the strip at 8:30?? The cab ride back cost over $40 - so plan accordingly if you don't have a car!"}
{"text":"Nice resort. Room internet was way to slow. I'd have to go to lobby to get access to Internet. Food was ok. Chuck the bell caption was rude and short when approached. Both times I'd have to walk behind the counter to get his attention. The hotel grounds are nice but the Service was bad. I can't see myself coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Use the spa and they make you feel guilty for tipping anything less than 20% - Devin and Brittany at the front were the worst. GVR If you are reading this take note so many of us at the hotel were talking about this and very angry about it."}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED  I've already gushed about my love for Station casino hotels in my review of Red Rock Resort so I'm not going to be redundant here. I just want to say that I love their Full Pay Video Poker machines, very good food courts and restaurants, distance from the congested madness of The Strip and proximity to major highways, which facilitates exploration of Vegas, Summerlin and Henderson (or is it \"Anthem\"....what's with that?......I hate that effin Ayn Rand).  Between 7/19 and 7/22, I spent four nights at Green Valley Ranch Resort & Spa. It is conveniently located off I-215, only about a 7 or 8 minute drive from McCarran Airport. If you are inclined toward shopping(I'm not), the beautiful surrounding development, The District, surrounds the resort and contains many high end retail outlets.For getaway day, those renting a car should know that there is a gas station just a minute up the Green Valley Parkway in the immediate vicinity of I-215.Like at most Station properties, there is a food court, multiplex movie theater, multiple restaurants running the gamut from casual to refined, Starbucks, the Grand Cafe (a really nice diner style place which is open 24 hours) and an inexpensive buffet.  Green Valley Ranch, like Red Rock, is one of Station's two premier properties.Prior to having stayed here, I'd played here for years.Those who love video poker as I do, should know that the casino has some 100 percent plus pay tables on Deuces Wild, Double Bonus Poker and Double Double Bonus Poker. I love playing in this casino. It is loaded with machines but there is plenty of open space to allow one to get around the casino without stress.  One thing I like about Green Valley is its sedate, classy but not over the top, decor. It is much quieter than Red Rock and my sense is that the typical patrons are less rowdy. You can get some peace and quiet here.My room was clean, attractive and spacious. I was pleased that it was the last room down a series of very long corridors so i did not have to listen to drunken jerks coming out of the elevator.  A note of caution to management: unlike at cheaper Station hotels like Boulder Station, there is no security guard at the entrance to the rooms on the casino level. It is simply too easy for someone with bad intent to approach an entering guest from the rear as the guest's card opens the room entrance. Station is creating the perfect conditions for a plaintiff's lawyer to make them look penny wise and dollar foolish.  With regard to food I enjoyed great meals at Pizza Rock and the Tides Seafood Bar & Grill. I gave those places their own reviews but I must say that you should put the Magherita Pie at Pizza Rock on your bucket list. The restaurant features a Prime Rib Buffet on Saturday evenings for less than 20 bucks if you have a player's card. If you are a carnivore like me, you will be in heaven.  My experience was not entirely positive. On one day, housekeeping forgot to clean my room. Also, on the first day of my stay my allegedly \"free\" basic Internet service kept going off arbitrarily while I was working. A call to customer service corrected this issue to my satisfaction, however. You should also be aware that Green Valley charges a mandatory \"resort fee\" of nearly thirty bucks a day. This makes your \"bargain\" room rate look a little less appealing, particularly if you, like me, are not a fan of pools and spas.  Despite the foregoing, I would recommend, without any reservations, that you experience a stay at Green Valley Ranch Resort and Spa."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The rooms are beautiful and spacious and the staff is always helpful. My husband and I do a lot of \"staycations\" and this is our favorite place. They have the best pool and spa and the grounds are beautiful!! There is plenty to do besides gamble. They have some very nice restaurants in the casino and a lovely gift shop.  They have first class shopping at the District which is just outside the door, as well as the movie theaters on the lower level. There are also some casual lounges where you can listen to some live music or go dancing.  This place never disappoints!!"}
{"text":"I've stayed here a few times and I've loved it every time.   I like the feeling that I'm in a resort far far away,  yet be only a few minutes from the strip.  The decor is beautiful,  this isn't a large scale hotel like on the strip,  but it feels luxurious from the lobby,  to your rooms. I do wait until they have reasonable prices,  i.e. travelzoo or sales on their site.   And here we are again for our anniversary!  Glad we chose to stay here to celebrate...  Would I stay here again.   Definelty!"}
{"text":"I am a local, and I can't believe how rude the employees are here. Maybe it's because im younger 33 but every person I encounter talks down to me. I placed a $3000 bet and the shift supervisor gave me attitude that I was doing this at 4pm. I don't know if he was getting off but no reason for this. He threw my Id back at me. Than when I won my bet they refused to cash it because my boys were in the casino. I understand 21 and older rule but just be nice about it. Going to take my money where it's appreciated"}
{"text":"Best kept secret in las Vegas for crabs. Customized to your liking they cook up your crabs with some secret house spices that'll fill your taste buds with Cajun flavors and garlic butter. Mmmmmm. Yelpers don't all come at once. I don't want this place to get the idea of lowering their quality for the masses. I'm waiting for my crab as I draft this review. Check out my pix to see what I see right now. You can also add the fresh shrimp into your custom dish.  $23 after tax for Brunch on a Sunday. Great for us crab eaters. I have no idea what the other stuff tastes like."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Green Valley Ranch Hotel.   My favorite parts:  Hanks...this place is phenomenal!  Great steaks and really fun happy hour.  Love the décor from the top to bottom.  Really nice place to go for special occasions.  Drop Bar...love the style of this bar.  I've always had a lot of fun here.  Someone please tell them to bring back Ladies Nights!  I used to come to this bar weekly and now I don't have the excuse to go!  Gambling...The only slot machine I'll play is Mermaid's Gold...and they have it!!!  I never win but I love to get their random bonuses.  Sports book...this location is so nice.  It almost feels like a den when you sit in the leather chairs to watch a game.  It's very comfy and entertaining to sit in the bar area....just get there early on a big game day, otherwise you aren't going to get a seat!  Ovation...this is a really nice venue.  It's small and intimate.  It'd be great if they could get more acts to perform...I know we would spend more time there if they did.  Buffet...I normally am not a fan of buffets but this one is very nice.  I'd strongly suggest the breakfast buffet.  Don't forget to get their players card.  You get a discount on the price of the buffet.   Overall, I love the District being next to the casino.  It's fun to have dinner at the District and walk to the casino or vice versa.  It's a good location for locals to hang out.  In addition to Hanks and Drop Bar, there are other nice restaurants and bars.  My only complaint, I wish Whiskey Sky was still open downstairs.  I hope they reopen some kind of night life here."}
{"text":"If you are planning an event, I cannot recommend the excellent staff and service at GVR enough.  The resort was the first my husband and I looked at when we began planning our wedding, and after one meeting with the event staff, we stopped looking.  The grand staircase and patio overlooking the pool was the picture perfect place for our ceremony and reception.    The event/catering staff, especially Kara, was so helpful, flexible and accommodating.  They offered suggestions when we were overwhelmed and stepped back and let us make our party our way when we needed to.  They really treated us like honored guests even though our wedding was small and didn't pull out all the stops.  We chose to have a cocktail hour with appetizer service instead of a formal dinner, and once we had decided on appetizers we were interested in, the event staff at GVR invited us to a private tasting to finalize our selections and try their cakes.  They really pulled out all the stops to please us.  I expected to try a few things in the events office, but when we got to the convention space of the resort, we saw our names with \"Tasting for the Wedding in Honor of...\" on the digital signs advertising the day's events.  We were led to a room with a beautiful table set up, white gloved servers and all.  A chef personally described each dish to us, some that we had selected and others they thought we might like based on our selections.  They really went above and beyond both my husband's and my expectations for help and service.  They also shared several sample cakes with us that day.  I was worried about having to have my cake done in-house, but I shouldn't have been.  Their pastry chefs are professional as can be.  All I had to do was email the event coordinator a picture of a cake I liked and there it was, like magic, on my wedding day.  The servers and bartender during our wedding were phenomenal as well.  The servers kept appetizers on everyone's plates with a friendly smile.  The bartender created a signature cocktail for the day that everyone loved and had champagne ready for the toasts.    We had some problems sorting out room reservations and group rates with the hotel, but the event/catering staff, especially Kara, gave us excellent and professional service from start to finish.  They really treated us like valued guests which can be a rarity in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Casino in the World!  It's a great place for food, slots, bingo, pool and movies.  Sports Book: Place your bets but make sure to ask for a drink ticket, you should get one for every bet you make.  Then head over to the bar and get a free drink with you ticket and relax on the plush seat and watch a game.  Slots: They have a good mix of new and classics.  They usually put all the new games in front of the buffet and around the drop bar.  Or you can check out some of the classics by the sports book and parking garage entrance.  Pool:  If you're a local they won't let you into the resort pool anymore (you used to pay a small fee to get in before 2012).  But instead, try going to the 21+ pool named 'The Pond', it's free and it's got a great atmosphere, live DJ, clean water and cold drinks.  I always take my out of town friends here.  Bingo:  The bingo hall here is big with large tables.  They also put the smokers behind glass to keep the air fresh.  You pay about $10 for a bingo packet for about an hour of entertainment plus you get 2 free drinks!  Sometimes they have fun promotions and give you candy bars with coupons in them or free donuts.  Movies:  Not a bad place to watch a movie.  They have 8 theaters and Tuesdays are half price tickets!"}
{"text":"Loved staying here!  It is great not to be on the strip and to not have to walk through the casino to get anywhere.  Pool is great and the pool bar food was even good. Prices are not crazy high like the hotels on the strip. Much better demographic of patrons."}
{"text":"Never stay here!  The resort is very nice, the staff is very nice, but it is in the middle of nowhere!  I have been here three times and have never waited less than 30 minutes for a taxi.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with the family. Usual breakfast buffet items with some Mexican specialties (menudo and sopes). Nothing special but you can't beat the $10.00 price. Be sure to sign up for My Rewards Preferred Card to get the discount!"}
{"text":"First, you should know it was $45 bucks from the center of the strip to this hotel. This thing might as well been located in Middle Earth.  Second beware they are there to rip you off. They do not tell you and never  quote it but they hit you with a so called resort fee of $28 in the incidental fees. Why not just be honest and tell me up front and charge me when I check out instead of back dooring me. This is dishonest.  The non-existent front desk was not very helpful in getting me a taxi and basically looked at me like \"what, us help you.\" You need to arrange a taxi because this thing is so far off the beaten path they just don't go there.  I left a message with there General Manager. Hope he has the guts to call. Well they killed my future business and that of anyone in my company."}
{"text":"Made a reservation months in advance.  Called early today to confirm the reservation as a nonsmoking, king room, and that we would be checking in late.  Btw, I was on hold for close to 10 minutes to do this.  Unfortunately when we arrived they told us they had no more nonsmoking rooms available and that we had to have a \"smoking optional\" room.  They should just call it what it is, a smoking room, because it REEEKS to the point of making my eyes water.  On top of that you can even open a window to get fresh air.  In addition, this resort is a sprawling, confusing complex in a commercial area next to a shopping center.  It wss hard to find the entrance and hard to find our room.  I would not recommend this place to anyone, nor would I ever stay here again."}
{"text":"We stayed at GVR over Memorial Day weekend.  We received three free nights, as we have spent a lot of money in the Casino over the past two years.  We were extremely pleased with our stay.  The room was clean and all the amenities were fabulous.  The staff was great and very helpful as well as kind.  Since the spa is open to guests who are staying in the hotel, we utilized the saunas, hot tubs and all the amenities and we couldn't be happier.  The spa was gorgeous, clean and relaxing.  We ate breakfast at the buffet one morning and it was okay.  Not great, just okay, but for the price, I'd eat there again.  I feel like the slot machines are very tight, so I probably wouldn't gamble much the next time we visit.  All in all, we are beyond happy with our stay and can't wait to go back and utilize the spa services, the pool, and try some of the other nice restaurants on the property.  I highly recommend this resort if you want to stay away from the Las Vegas strip and relax in style!"}
{"text":"I like Green Valley Ranch.  It's quiet, fun and full of value.  I attended a Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine concert in May and have come back six times since that concert.  (Note: Not a local).  They have an excellent buffet, good gambling, great customer service from every employee I encountered, great bartenders and a good selection of things to kill time.  While I have not stayed here as a guest due to my loyalty to South Point, I am considering a stay here and Red Rock Spa & Casino in the near future.    My issue is that this place and all other stations charge resort fees (NO I WILL NOT ACCEPT IT!) and it is $24.99 a day here.  Rediculous.  So the near future may come and go and I may not stay here, but I will still visit and dine in their fine establishments and low roll gamble at their Video Poker machines."}
{"text":"This resort is beautiful, but our bathroom was covered with ants and none of the resort staff were responsive to our issue. When we first got to our room, we started to notice two or three ants on the vanity and around the sink in the bathroom and just shrugged it off. The next morning, we found an ant in our bed and a long trail of ants that stretched across the bath tub, up the shower wall, over the ceiling and down the other wall. We called 3 times, talking with different people each time and waited all morning for the front desk to send someone (which they never did) and ended up checking out before we were helped. We showed the front desk attendant pictures we took of the bathroom and he dismissed our concern and never apologized for our bad experience.  The ants were one issue, but the poor customer service was what made our experience so bad. We are so disappointed in this resort because it has the potential to be a gem in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"As a local, Green Valley Ranch is probably my favorite Casino. The atmosphere and casino employees seem to really be a cut above."}
{"text":"I do the HAPPY DANCE when I know I'm going to \"The Pond @ GVR\" This place is amazing, I think my bestie Ebony for introducing me to this place. A MUST TRY  The Pond is the adult pool @ GVR, sorry NOT topless...Adult Pool.   Free Entry, 21+ ONLY!  Towels Included Lounge Chairs are FREE (They go FAST, so get there early)  $100 - Beds ($100 Tab of food and drinks covers your bed) $300 - Cabana ($300 Tab of Food and drink covers you cabana)  Small space, not like mega strip, kind of personal. Very grown up like. Bed can fit up to 3ppl and Cabana 8ppl. AWESOME DJ - DJFurious Stylez..  Good Music, Food and Good Drink....an escape from the mega strip and local friendly  Pool Hours: 11am - 6pm  Thereafter your Adult Pool time, take an evening walk in THE DISTRICT and grab a bite to eat.  A nice way to end the weekend"}
{"text":"Beautiful, Serene, Relaxing, Top Notch customer service!!  When I was there with my VIP I realized I left my photo ID in another hotel in Strip. So I showed my copy ID instead and explained the lady the situation. Luckily the front desk white lady somehow instantly recognized me, \"Miss Arts, you ve stayed here before\" and She smiled! OMG i m so impressed. Every staff here from front desk, casino security, concierge, spa staff are all incredibly nice, professional I just want to express deep appreciation for all of you especially when I am with my VIP lady  Everything feels Grand and Queenly feel like I'm getting pampered when I stay here!!"}
{"text":"The rooms are great!  I love this place because it's so close to mi casa. I'm a fan!  We go to the movies all the time here."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite hotels in Vegas (technically it's in Henderson). It has an European luxury hotel feel to it. The staff treat guests with respect from the moment you check in until you check out. Rooms are spacious, comfortable, and quiet. The toilet is in its own room off the bathroom. We dined at their steakhouse \"Hanks\" and had a delicious seafood Ceasar salad with big chunks of shrimp. You won't be disappointed with the food and drinks here but it is pricey. The pool area is simple with a sandy beach entry which feels like a massage. There is also an adult pool area that we have enjoyed on other visits. What makes this resort different from the mega strip resorts is that it's easy; you don't to cross a mile of a crowded, noisy casino to reach the front desk. No annoying flashing neon lights & garish shops. Instead of billboards everywhere trying to get you to spend more of your money seeing their shows, eating at their restaurants, GVR has flower arrangements and beautiful furniture and art on the walls. When you go to the pools there is no security guard asking everyone to open their bags so they can see what's inside. Finally, when we leave GVR we feel relaxed not jarred from the stay."}
{"text":"I recommended this place to a friend of mine visiting from Australia, given it's convenient location to my house.  It was probably the worst recommendation I've ever made.  First, check in was late.  No apology, just an \"Oh, your room isn't ready but should be in a few hours\" - this at after 4PM.  Second, they double charged him for his room - ie, they hard charged the entire stay in advance, and then \"authorized\" the entire amount + incidentals  yet again (he was staying in a suite for eight days, so we're not talking chump change).  When it was pointed out, not only did the front desk not acknowledge the mistake, but proceeded to argue with him for three days, even though he showed bank verification of the double posting.  After three days of continuous hassle, and three days when several thousand dollars was no longer easily available for other events, they finally acknowledged and corrected their mistake, but failed to apologize or even offer any sort of compensation.  Third, room service ~ basically don't order anything but the fresh fruit, and don't make /any/ special requests, because you'll be ignored.  Seriously, don't do what I did, do NOT EVER recommend this as a decent place to stay that's \"off Strip\", because frankly, I've seen better front desk customer service at a Hawthorne Inn."}
{"text":"Love this hotel! We don't gamble but love coming here just to get away from LA! The hotel room rate is always fair. I especially love the spa! Oh yea we received great service from Paul, he was nice enough to give us a tour of the spa, and pool areas, very nice guy!"}
{"text":"I have been been a frequent video poker player for over 20 years. One of the things I always hated about casinos is that they can get filled with cigarette/cigar smoke at times (because I actually become physically ill if I am in a smoke filled room for more than a few minutes). Based on this, I only gamble at casinos that offer no smoking sections. Green Valley has one of the best non smoking sections in Vegas/Henderson. Unlike many casinos (who just set up a very small section of the casino as non smoking, and is surrounded by the smoking area), Green Valley actually designates an entire wing to non smoking, that is nicely separated from the smoking area. They also offer 99.8% return, and over 100% return, video pokers games in this section (so the game selection is very good, and there are many slant tops, which are less taxing on your arm, wrist and back, if you play for awhile). Another thing I like about Green Valley is when you order a coffee/tea (or my favorite Green Valley hot drink, hot chocolate with whipped cream) from a cocktail waitress, they give you a regular cup that you would get if you ordered it from a coffee shop (like Starbucks or Jitters).  Most other casinos serve you coffee/tea in these little wimpy water glasses. Overall, Green Valley is elegant inside and out, offers many good video poker machines, a great non smoking section, a big food court, great resturuants, and good normal size drinks served by pretty cocktail waitresses....the only negative is, if you ONLY play over 100% video poker games, your monthly mailer is going to be terrible, no matter how much you gamble...I am at Green Valley's highest reward level (Chairman), and my monthly mailer is ridiculously much lower than any other casino that I gamble at....but putting that aside, Green Valley is a very good casino."}
{"text":"Loved our stay there! West tower was newly renovated and wonderful. Even better when they comped us a refrigerator and we brought our own booze and breakfast for a 4 day stay for a dance competition.   The only hitch was our reservation. Which got majorly messed up. But, ended up better than we expected."}
{"text":"The resort fee is outrageous!  You have a pool...what else?  I'ts not worth the $25 fee.   The slots were VERY tight and the casino was very slow.  The best part of my stay was the bahtroom in my room.  Very nice."}
{"text":"Was here for a convention this week and the place was decent. They event staff did a great job accommodating our convention. The valet and front desk were friendly, helpful, courteous and very professional. Housekeeping department dropped the ball one of the days- oh well... next time I'll just have them clean the room right there and then instead of asking them to come back in an hour- No biggie. Staff at the lobby bar was not very friendly and a little rude. The casino was good, plenty of open tables. However, Roger at the Black Jack table was a total freaking jerk! It was as if they had dragged his ass to work kicking and screaming. Stay home if you're not feeling it you prick! He alone dropped this review to a three star. I did pick up a couple hundred bucks though :)"}
{"text":"Gets you off the Las Vegas strip and  the grounds are really nice. They have multiple pools and private cabanas. The spa is nicer than most, rooms are clean and beautifully decorated.  Turf Grill is awesome, the food is great...I suggest the prime rib and wedge salad with blue cheese. The casino was busy but not the adrenalin rush of the strip. If you want to gamble but also want to relax by the pool this is the place to go....low key, relaxing and you still get have the Casino. Oh yeah, reasonable rates. Great value if you want to vacation in the lap of luxury."}
{"text":"Bingo has the rudest staff ever! They have favorite customers and look down on everyone else. I play bingo daily at stations and in henderson... I will not be back to this station ever!"}
{"text":"Great place to stay at have been going there for years during the summer. Price is affordable and has great accommodations. The casino is a very inviting environment and am glad that there is a great cafe to have at night.Great pool and the staff in great."}
{"text":"I come here one week per year. I really enjoy the spa. Treated like royalty. And, it's included with your stay. Simply awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent rooms. I love the oatmeal bar of soap (gentle exfoliation that leaves the skin silky smooth and clean with a light fragrance).  My mother and I both got massages. Her masseuse, Chad, worked out the knots in her back with the Deep Blue Deep Tissue massage. I tried the Ashiastu massage with Chris, who also worked out my back. The massages were superb. The hotel amenities were fabulous. The Feast buffet for breakfast was delicious. If we happen to be in the vicinity again, we will revisit this place."}
{"text":"11yrs ago I was looking for a place to have my wedding and was considering this place.  The wedding planner treated me like crap so we had our wedding at the four seasons - worked out for the best.   Dial it forward to today.  Against my better judgment I stay here for work mtgs. The two people at the lobby desk are doing nothing - nothing - I ask for a wake up call and they say no.  Maybe I have to call in to an automated system?  No!  A real person!  So why can the staff at this supposed AAA four diamond resort not lift a finger?  I'm glad your level of service hasn't changed in 11yrs."}
{"text":"Always a nice stay. The ambiance is very low key. As we're frequent visitors to Vegas, we prefer to stay away from the strip. GVR is a great choice for anyone who would prefer a higher end place off strip at a reasonable price.  Their greatest asset is their employees. From the hotel valet to the servers and cashier at the buffet, you are always met with a smile and truly feel that they want your stay to be memorable.  If you like to shop, there is \"The District\" literally a stones throw away.  We'll look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Sooooooo..... went to turn my comforter down to get in bed and what's on the sheets you ask?? BLOOD!  Called Housekeeping to speak with someone, had me on hold forever so I had to hang up call front desk, lady tells me it will take 20-30 minutes to come, REALLY...  Housekeeping came to change the bed but never ever changed pillowcases, then he leaves so I take pillows back off bed to get back in bed a second time, there's BLOOD on pillows. Unbelievable! As Guy is changing sheets on bed he was speechless that whoever cleaned room didn't see stains. Just disgusted!  WTH REALLY HAPPENED IN THIS ROOM?!?!  You can't be serious and TELL ME that when they were cleaning room and making bed they didn't see these BLOOD STAINS on bed  So baffled!"}
{"text":"A very groovy destination property in Henderson. They have a great buffet (Ask For Wilma). This is an all around fun place. I should mention the pool is very cool as well. So if you find yourself on the Eastside stop on in and let loose. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Large gambling spa resort. Many restaurants, poker room, meeting rooms, pools and 2 wings of hotel rooms. Nice views from almost every room. They also have a tub and shower in their standard rooms. Good light blockout curtains. Outdoor pool.  What makes this place extra fun is that you can walk out of the casino and go to an outdoor shopping mall with restaurants, retail and hobby stores. There is actually fun restaurants here and interesting retail stores from jewelry, clothes, to hiking wares. Most bars/restaurants feature gambling and great beer/alcohol features.  Can walk even farther to a Whole foods and pizza place. Lots of stuff."}
{"text":"We live in a world of just OK. GVR hits that stride in spades.  ok restaurants. ok gambling pits. ok rooms.  On the plus side you have a lot of offsite access to other entertainment and restaurants so the isolation from the strip is lessened.  The pool layouts are unique and designed for families.  Not really a cool spot for adults."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We have been twice so far. It is our new favorite getaway. The employees are so nice and polite. The facility is beautiful and well kept, including the landscape. The pool area is great. This place is great for couples and families. We will be back again very soon!"}
{"text":"GVR is a solid option for the area whether you are looking to stay overnight, have dinner, or enjoy a spa day. In comparison to the locals casinos in Henderson, this one is the best.  Before moving to town my husband and I stayed here a couple of nights. His company flew him in for a conference and flew me in to look for a place to live. It's not the most convenient place to lodge if you are leaving property each day because everything is a hike from the rooms. The walk from self parking to the front desk is ridiculous with luggage so I'd definitely recommend valet parking for guests. The room was clean and had a luxurious feel. The only amenity that wasn't provided was a coffee maker. Completely inconvenient, but typical because they want to strong-arm you into spending money at on site coffee shops. Can you just charge for Keurig pods in the room like mini bar items already? I'll gladly give you my money, but don't inconvenience me.  The property is amazing and meticulously maintained. The pool and lounging area looks like a lavish resort pool area should look. They've done a great job with this section of the resort. The spa is also clean with a luxurious feel. Locals get discounts on services at the spa which I have definitely taken advantage of a few times. The spa also has its own parking lot at the back of the property making it very convenient for locals.   The restaurant selection inside of GVR and in the attached District is solid. My favorite restaurants inside the property are Pizza Rock and Tides Seafood & Sushi Bar. Both are casual, but have good food. The Grand Café isn't anything special, but is a good option for a quick lunch. Hank's is hands down the worst restaurant I've been to in this entire town. The food is horrible and somehow the service is even worse than the food. I'm excited that the property is about to add an Italian restaurant and a Mexican restaurant as well. There are also several quick serve options including Starbuck's, Capriotti's, and Fat Burger."}
{"text":"After having been to the spa, I wanted to check out the resort part of Green Valley Ranch (GVR) and decided to stay here after seeing a \"Dinner and Movie\" package, which started at $95 on a weeknight and $130 on weekends. It's a great deal because in those prices you get two buffet entries ($40 value), 2 Regal Cinema movie tickets ($13 value), and buy 1 get 1 free drinks at their Drop bar, for each night you stay. I like this place because it's only 8 miles off the strip, and it really feels like you're on vacation.   I really wanted to give GVR five stars, but I just couldn't because the shower pressure totally sucked. I called and they sent engineering right away. He said he couldn't do much because the water-saving shower heads were like that. So change the heads!   Beds were nice, room was comfortable and the pool was really big, with separate pools for adults, and a long lounge-like one up top by the cabanas. I have no idea if you had to reserve those or not, but we had gone up there to just hang out since it was quieter.  Overall, a great experience for a quick weekend trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I'd think twice before booking.  I had a terrible experience with staff, and even with a manager.  I travel frequently and am accustomed to staying in hotels all over the country.  The folks at GVR are unaccommodating, rude, and even unfair."}
{"text":"Let me first say, if it was not for a work function I would never come here.  Everything that could go wrong for them, went wrong.  They now have 150+ people who will never visit their establishment again.   First off, we came in and their computers were down.  That they can't help.  What they could have done however, was anticipate 150 people arriving from a very big company.  They had no back up plan.  The staff were rude and impatient.  They could have handed out some water, brought luggage tags over so we could store our belongings, etc.  they could have had us fill out the paperwork for our rooms so once we got to the front of the line it could be expedited but instead they did everything on paper with ineffectiveness. Again, that would be expected since systems were down. They truly need to work on effectiveness.  They could have had us filling out what they needed to streamline their process.  We needed to attend a conference so I dropped off my things at the bellhop (which was another line I needed to wait in after waiting in line for 30 minutes to NOT get checked in).  The rooms were typical, no complaints here.  Except for the fact that many of my peers were given rooms with guests already in them, one person found cockroaches in her room and we were spread across all over the grounds of this establishment.  Again anticipating 150 people were coming in (which the conference has been planned and booked months in advance). They could have kept us all in one area so it would make out trek to the conference rooms easier.  The food during my 3 day conference was terrible.  I barely ate and even when we were eating, I felt rushed.  The staff would clear up as soon as they gave us our food.  Dinner was completed and the man came and took all the salt and pepper shakers off the table even before dessert came out.  Some people were still finishing up their dinners when they did this.  He couldn't wait for after we were done to clear the table?   Literally, there were so pmany things that went wrong I can't even possibly write this all in.  There is one last thing I do want to mention.  The last day of the conference, they again did not anticipate 150 people needing to leave to catch flights.  They only had 10 cabs available.  10x4 to a cab = 40 people!!! 150 was what they should have anticipated!!!! After waiting  a hour and 10 minutes, I finally got on a cab.    Not to mention, I don't think one person from their staff was cordial or welcoming to us.  We all work in customer service and this establishment needs to go back to training or hire some effective team members.  I will say it always start from the top.  The management should have been on point here to ensure a seamless experience for us but they failed terribly.  Needless to say, I will NEVER come back here on my own dime which is a terrible loss for Green Valley because if they know anything about customer experience,  each person with a negative experience tells 5-8 people.  With social media (and all systems are up here) ... You get the point. Tsk. Tsk."}
{"text":"Great casino, excellent Vibe, wonderful, beautiful environment and classy atmosphere, nice overall feel. Very clean, friendly engaging helpful workers. Good assortment of slots and a \"GREAT RACE & SPORTS BOOK\" Big clean, great screens. Nice assortments of restaurants, Don't know how good, never smell any aroma spilling out, Uhm. Don't like that. Otherwise casino over all, Clean, elegant, classy and big. Great place, Excellent Race Book. Plenty of easy parking. Valet for the lazy. Never use it. But it's here. Don't like strangers rummaging thru my car, and driving it Reckless, rather get in some exercise and park myself. Average person could use some exercise with all the junk food they eat, lol Casino is Stupendous! TREAT YOURSELF - ITS CLASSY ! It's FUN, It's Clean, pretty surroundings! NO RIFF RAFF! Good Class of People !"}
{"text":"We have stayed here a few times but the most recent stay was for 10 days and this place takes care of you!    This place is wonderful as you don't feel like you are in Vegas let along at a casino! The pools and fitness/spa area is the best! With shopping and theater's right outside and great eateries all around; what a perfect place to stay! I am a Crap's player and enjoy playing here!   You will not be disappointed when you stay here...check it out get away from the strip and enjoy Vegas!"}
{"text":"We are staying for the first time at this magnificent property!!   First, when you arrive you are greeted by courteous valets and bellmen. The finishes are superb and it feels like a classy place. One of the first things I noticed was that there was no smoke odor in the air. The hotel portion of the property is smoke free!!   When we checked in, the staff was courteous and got us checked in right away. I did not particularly like being upsold on our room not once. It twice during the check in process.   Our room is a \"deluxe king\" room...also know as the basic non view room . The room is well finished with tall ceilings and a beautiful spacious bathroom. The bed is super comfortable.   The negatives of the room were the A/C struggles to cool the room. I often found myself on top of the covers sweating despite setting the thermostat on 63! Also...this is a place for a romantic getaway...there has been some spectacular events occurring in the bed!! However, this bed squeaks louder than the bed in your parents guest room!!!!   The pool is amazing! The buffet is delicious!   I took one star off for the A/C, however we will be back again."}
{"text":"This property is amazing and clean however the only annoyance I have is that because the property is so large that It takes me 20 mins once I park valet to walk to my room. I do a lot of in and out while in the area so its not very convenient for me but I would come back and ask for a closer room next time. The sand pool is amazing esp for children and the room service food is very impressive especially the chicken pot pie and they have 24 hour breakfast which is amazing because I love to eat pancakes at night ."}
{"text":"We are locals, and we love the GVR...everything about it except for one thing.  My wife and I frequently get comp drinks for this or that, and the only place you can cash in the comp is at the bar in the sports book.  My wife and I are both scotch drinkers, and the only Scotch we can get, on our level anyway,  is from the gun.  Oh my god... is it horrible!!!!!  We can handle bad scotch from the bottle, but man ... this is a rubber tasting horrible drink.  Please GVR, either clean your lines or just get a couple cheap bottles of scotch and pour from the bottle. The Green Valley Ranch is a level above other local casinos. Please correct this oversight. Thank you. Two loyal local customers."}
{"text":"Absolutely love that this casino is right down the street from us.  Payouts are great and most of the staff is amazing.  My favorite card dealers are Tristan and Gail.  They'll stop us when we're just walking around to say hello and check in on us.  We've only had one bad experience with one of the high limit bartenders which was taken care of promptly by the assistant bar manager.   Bingo is super fun to play here and usually pays out well especially if you hit the earlier game times.   Overall a fun place to play if you have a few extra bucks."}
{"text":"This review is for the Spa at GVR...  It was amazing.  They now offer 20% off 7 days a week for vegas residents.  The massage was amazing.  I had Jodi, and she was awesome!  It was relaxing, and perfect.  The only thing i would have hoped of more for was more co-ed stuff.  They only had 1 jacuzzi where i could hang out with my boyfriend before/after our massages."}
{"text":"Pretty close to the house so we have been there a few times. Very nice property, usually quiet. Have noticed kind of an older crowd. This is one of the \"upscale\" Station casinos. Got a bunch of $50 gift cards for $25ea. Easy to find parking in the garage (out of the sun.)   Their buffet is smaller and the line can be quite long and slow moving. If you get a players club card the buffet is a good deal. The origional pancake house has a great apple pancake. The have a theater and are close to shopping and restaurants.  Have had mixed success at blackjack but the dealers are always friendly. Think i am about even or perhaps a little behind. Have found it nearly impossable to get a cocktail. oh well saves on tips. Not sure about slots but have not heard of any friends retiring on their winnings from GVR."}
{"text":"Absolute gorgeous hotel in a prime location. The bartenders at the sports bar are the best/friendliest staff I've encountered. The restaurants are really good with something for everyone, it's also next to the district where you can shop and eat as well."}
{"text":"Went to the Green Valley Ranch Spa yesterday it was probably one of the best massages I've had in a long time my girl was Named Sue and it's both like the Sioux Indians Squad she is really really good they treat you like gold they're the only thing I didn't like is they make you tip I think that if I wasn't made to tip I probably would have tipped more but otherwise overall it was a really great treatment that is the only thing that I find wrong about the place is I understand tipping and I understand what to add to but please don't make me do it"}
{"text":"Bottom line, the cashiers in the cage and their management (Marnie and Janet) do not value locals and regardless of how much money one might spend at the restaurants and theaters, it doesn't matter if you don't gamble. There is no benefit to being a Station Casino card holder. I wasn't allowed to cash a check because they had no record of me ever having cashed a check. When I told Marnie and Janet that I had in fact cashed a check in December, they implied I was either lying or mistaken because they had the nerve to suggest it was probably a different Casino I went to. Yes, because I am that much of an idiot to get big hotels with distinctive lights and general thematic aesthetics all mixed up. The funny part? I went in the next day and asked about check cashing policies and a different manager and cashier (Leila and Jackie) told me they would have, more than likely, just cashed it because the check wasn't over the limit and that it was from a well known blank. Janet and Marnie simply did not want to help me for whatever reason. I worked in hospitality (front desk) for two years and I can assure you that Marnie and Janet were so far removed from guest service standards that it was genuinely jarring. I've reached out to corporate and I will post any updates. Judging by the lack of response from GVR on this website, I doubt it will yield anything."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful resort if you don't mind being 10 minutes off the strip.   You get the high end resort feel without the Vegas hustle and bustle.  I usually stay on the strip and did for New Year's Eve but took a chance in priceline with this hotel and it was awesome.  Beautiful rooms and a 24 hot tub.  There is a Casino attached but you would never know as its on the back side.  You don't have to walk through the smoke to get to your room.  There was no wait each time for valet which is a huge plus.  Not sure I'd take a cab here is a little far   I found this place on priceline and the funny thing it said it's by the airport 4.5 stars but it's definitely not.  Not sure who to blame for that.  My only compliant would be the $30 resort fee but it seems they are all doing it now in VEGAS"}
{"text":"Came here for my fiancee's Christmas Party and booked a room for the night.  The room was beautiful, but our window was facing the parking lot.  Not my favorite part of it.  The bathroom was gorgeous and spacious.  The grounds were well kept.  The pool was breathtaking.  Will come back in the summer.  The catering was decent for the Christmas Party, pretty standard fare (prime rib, chicken, salmon, veggies and various salads).  Great time overall!!!"}
{"text":"I need to write a positive review of GVR because it appears the poor place has gotten a bad rap.  OK, first:  I wasn't staying at the hotel so I can't comment on that.  My wife and I went there to gamble for a few hours and the four stars is for the loose slots -- much better than the Vegas strip -- we both walked away up, which on slots is rare. Also I had such a wonderful time playing Craps with the local old men that it will now be a funny and great memory (the lone out of town chic hanging out on a Sunday morning getting betting tips from these dudes - prepare to be schooled - but in a good way - I walked up ahead on this game too).  The comps aren't all that exciting - $3 to join - but the \"food court\" experience is convenient, as you can just hop over to get a piece of pizza or some Panda Express without paying an arm and a leg and committing yourself to a buffet.  I liked that, as we were short on time and wanted to maximize our gaming experience.  Yes, it's far from downtown Vegas, but we were staying with family in Henderson for this part of the trip.  I would actually come back now that I know about it, but only if I were renting a car -- a cab fare would be too much from downtown Vegas."}
{"text":"This place has wifi for those of you who like get online and brag about how beautiful this place is.  I am not a gambler so therefore i am not going to talk about  it but what I am going to talk about is its design and architecture, simply beautiful.  It is family friendly with a pool area, food court and rodeo style shopping area with more restaurants again.  The buffet is awesome, staff that work in this place is great always willing to assist anyone."}
{"text":"Nice big casino. My wife had a massage at the spa, she was very happy with it. Plenty of food options, and plenty of good shopping at the district."}
{"text":"Nice place in Henderson near a friends house. Much nicer than most of Station's other places including Red Rock. Probably since it's partialy owned by the Greenspuns'. The movie theater is nice and the buffet is better than other Stations as well make this my favorite Station brand casino."}
{"text":"For an establishment that is marketed for local clients and community choice  - On April 30th, I went with my son to meet with a group of local teens/parents that chose GVR as a gathering point for their high school junior prom.  Unfortunately the weather was pouring rain (very rare in this area) so our group had to migrate into the hallways - away from players area, lobby areas, or any other guest area (we made sure not to be in the way of other hotel guests) - the kids wanted to get pictures together.  However, the casino staff quickly told us that NO photography was allowed inside the casino (even in the hallways!) and that we all had to leave - to wait outside in the rain for til the group bus came.  We, as parents that do shop, eat and play (spend money) at this casino could not understand the lack of staff to try to accommodate us at all for these kids (to perhaps open an empty room, conference room etc that was not in use, the hallway??  no slot machines, doorways in photos) the lack of support and understanding and quickness to move local community citizens outside to the rain in spite of our requests.  It will have to be a pretty desparate situation for me to find myself paying to visit this casino for any reason anytime soon..there are MANY MANY other options that provide better community appreciation with amazing customer service."}
{"text":"Beyond breathtaking with the beautiful architecture, design, overwhelming amount of friendly staff greeting you at every door. Can't wait until we can return and stay longer and take advantage of the many amenities!"}
{"text":"Here for 4 nights 5 days for a soccer tournament.  Needless to say we were in and out with the car several times per day.   We had no other choice since there is no self parking.   We tipped the valet here and there but not every time.  They got downright rude and aggressive about it.   They continually spelled our last name wrong on the claim check tag which I spelled out for them (easy name 5 letters which they made 8)  It was irritating so another reason we didn't tip (5 times a day) just to get our car.  Shower in room has 2 temperatures scalding hot and hot.  Water flow from shower was slightly more than a dribble.  Pool was fantastic except many people laying out in 90 degree weather on couches with no towels and then you were \"allowed\" to lay in their body filth once chair was empty.  Kind of gross.  Only open until 4pm (lame) it was 80 degrees out today and a holiday weekend. No coffee makers in room but free coffee on lobby level (barely edible)  and Starbucks on 2nd floor.  On positive note hotel was pretty smoke free except for casino floor which was refreshing.  It was very beautiful.  Rooms were fine but nothing spectacular.  Servers by pool were great  (sorry forgot your name tattooed back) but bimbo lifeguard was awful and was there just to get a tan for her night job.  Of the Sunset properties we've visited, we still like Red Rocks the best.   2 stars due to poor service (mostly valet and housekeeping) and room quality   Day 3:  Valet has gotten so nasty that they now just hand us our keys and let us walk to the car.  Wish I had back the 25-30$ I've given them so far in tips.  They deserve nothing.  I've also realized instead of our last name they've started putting a code on our claim check indicating we don't tip.  Worst service I've ever experienced.    We were gone today from 5 am to 3pm for a soccer tournament.  Housekeeping never came.  They knocked on our door @ 330 and couldn't understand why I was a bit irritated.   I just gave her our trash and asked for a few clean towels.   Really? and yes my do not disturb light was NOT on."}
{"text":"Planning on going to the pool?  BEWARE!!  The pool manager, Rolondo has the worst customer service!!  I'm sure under stress and pressure to hit numbers.....I took the brunt of this one.  I was hustled and tricked into paying for a day bed.  From the moment I got there, I told them that I was unwilling to pay for a $200 daybed, but if they wanted to waive the charge or if the casino was willing to waive the charge, that I would gladly spend at least $200 worth of food and alcohol.  They said that they would call the casino and find out.  Every 30 minutes I received the same message....\"still waiting to hear from the casino...would you like more drinks or food?\"  3 1/2 hours later...time to settle up....\"Oh the casino won't comp it and neither will we...so you will have to pay the $200!\"   Long story short...Rolondo refused to listen to me or believe anything that I had to say, called security (security didn't even know why they were there because I wasn't causing a scene), then told me that I would have to take it up with the casino.  So, I went to settle up.....NO waitress came to help me.  So I went to the bar....they called Rolondo again.....he refused to even come talk with me and sent a waitress to deliver his message.....\"you are all settled up and everything has been charged to your room\"   REALLY???   Who authorized that???  Because I certainly didn't!!!   Struggling to hit \"Holiday numbers\" on Easter Sunday...they only had maybe 2 out of the 9 daybeds rented and from what I could see....ZERO cabanas rented.....I was the victim of a hustle!  I find out later that Rolondo didn't even call the casino till it was time for me to settle up the bill\"   WHY WAS I TOLD EVERY 30 MINUTES THAT THEY WERE STILL WAITING ON A CALL BACK FROM THE CASINO?   Rolondo tried to brush this one off on the casino and make them deal with it!  Refussing to even speak with the \"customer\" and sending a waitress to deliver his message.  WONDERFUL PROFESSIONALISM ROLONDO!!!     Bottom line after hours of problems and going back and forth between the pool and the casino.....the pool dropped the fee to $100 and the casino picked up the $100 charge.   Moral here.....BUYER BEWARE OF ROLONDO AND THE GVR POOL!!!       And props to Eric in the casino for helping to turn a horrible experience into a happier one.  Eric was outstanding, professional and a man of his word!   Eric is an asset to GVR......ROLONDO, MANAGER OF GVR POOL, WILL MOST LIKELY NOT BEING WORKING THERE LONG.   (WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE AND LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM THAT I HAVE HAD IN MY 12 YEARS LIVING IN LAS VEGAS.)"}
{"text":"Overall pretty good experience. We came for a conference being held and the room was at a discounted rate but you miss out on some of the fun of Vegas by staying out here. The room was okay, but we had two rooms and one was nicer than the other even though we were paying the same and the same layout. The food selection was pretty standard, the only really great place was the steakhouse. The pool was beautiful and the grounds were gorgeous outside but the poolside drink service was really slow. Our room for three only had 2 towels. The staff was friendly and they had some great dealers. They do have a shuttle to the strip but the last one comes back at 8:30. Overall good, probably a better option for families. Or people looking for a reprieve from the craziness of the traditional Vegas experience."}
{"text":"This is a pretty hotel. The pool area is monitored by security that prevent you from bringing in food or drink. The service though is horrible so in 105 degree temps 100 or more people rely on a single jug of complimentary water that is often empty ... Waitresses are few and after renting a cabana I received no service and after requesting a soda one of these gals invented a story to explain why she failed to serve us even cold water .. she said I was yelling ... so I guess that's the reason there was no service ... friends told management no yelling so we were given Cabana for free and still very little service and next day same in other areas of pool. Restaurants have lines so I ate pizza from a food court the majority of time I was here. Casino looks aged ...not sure if I'd return."}
{"text":"Stayed here this past weekend 2/27 - 3/1 with my family while down for a football tournament and my family absolutely loved it!! Nice atmosphere, modern rooms, excellent customer service, plus I won a few coins on the crap table..NO Complaints whatsoever!! Looking forward to visiting again"}
{"text":"So we were so excited to stay at this resort for its amazing reviews and were pretty disappointed, especially for what we paid. The room and amnesties were outstanding however we check in and my spouse, I and  kids enjoy the private spa. Afterward I'm ready to shower and the water in the master was freezing cold. My husband even tried to 20 minutes to get it to warm up while I stood there in my bikini freezing. Second issue our neighbors decide to blast their amazing surround sound which is loudest above our master bed from 1:45am to little after 3am. Even though I called to complain around 2 am a whole hour went by (mind you we had just driven from the Grand Canyon and this was our vacation. Also found it a little strange that the main pool closes at 6pm...my kids were rudely told to get out after a couple minutes and there were no signs about this so we could have been told in a nicer manner. Lastly my kids of course leave their floaties and get off the phone with lost and found and WE have to pay for the items robbed shipped. I've stayed and Cesar's hotels several times and forgot bathing suits etc and they always ship my items free of charge. Yeah we pay over 1K a night here for a villa and I have to pay for my items to be returned...seriously next time we will find another luxury resort that has better customer service and probably for a lot less too."}
{"text":"This is a great resort with endless possibilities but the front desk and management have  no training in customer service.  They are rude, abusive, not able to help and simply recite rules and regulation."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend because her mom had some MyVegas coupons. She got two cabanas and $175 total in food/drink credit.  When we got to GVR we ate some breakfast at the buffet, but mostly were in it for the endless mimosas because they were strong and free flowing (aka best combo).  We headed out to the cabanas around noon and they were nice! Ceiling fans, couches, mini fridge and auxiliary cord to bump Sublime with. We didn't stay in it for long though. We soon headed to the pool, which, for the cabanas, there's a little mini pool thing that's 3.5 ft deep and more like a long thin river than a pool, but it's ideal for sitting in, cooling off, having a smoke/drink in. And that was where we stayed for almost the entire day! The waitresses were super nice and really good to us. They were quick and kept our pitchers full. The Purple Haze pitcher was some crazy good cocktail that hit quickly while the Orange Rum Beach drink (forgot the name!) was super tasty and slightly less potent. I think we tried all the drinks, either in singles or pitchers. The sangria had really pretty garnishes; the mai tai was a werid blue green color that looked beautiful, until the colors mixed and it looked sewage-y. The sex on the beach was good, nothing too remarkable.  So yeah. The nachos were lame; just a couple of chips on a long platter with toppings; however, the chicken was really good as was the fruit platter and chips and dip. The watermelon and guac were super fresh!  As for the pool pool. My friend and I ventured down to the big pool in the afternoon and it was nice. The water was quite a bit warmer (kind of gross but still, always a relief from 104 degree weather) and the sand was weird. The grain texture felt unlike an ocean but it was cool nonetheless. I even found some in my bikini bottom when I went to the bathroom later! The regular pool was deeper also, 4 ft, but had lots of splashy kids and no one was really drinking so we went back to our cold, shallow, alcohol pool and stayed there till we left around 7.  Last thing- the lawn chairs here are amazing. They are so fucking comfy! My friend passed out in one and I almost fell asleep too. There were multiple people sleeping in these incredibly comfortable chairs, so lay in them, but be warned.  Definitely stop by the GVR pool if you're looking for a get away from the Strip and the heat! It's much quieter but still top tier, excellency! Awesome day-cation in summary."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go to that are away from the strip. It's not close to Downtown Las Vegas, but I really enjoy the Resort, my favorite being the buffet over there - quality for a good price. It's pretty popular and gets busy, especially during lunch time and later in the evening for seafood and prime rib dinner. I really like the neighborhood, with stores like William Sonoma and Trader Joe's close by."}
{"text":"So we used to live in Henderson right nearby this casino so it became our go to spot. But it was more than just the convenience of  proximity that sold us on it. It was the bartender at the sports book bar, Tyler, who kept us coming back. He is such an incredibly nice person. Yes he is warm and welcoming, but it is more than that. You can tell he is genuinely kind and caring and he is always so helpful and remembers us every time we come in. He talks sports with us, got us turned on to the Round Robin, and makes my Bloody Mary perfectly every time (he understands what \"extra spicy\" means and doesn't underestimate my ability to handle spice just because I am a white girl lol). Point is, casino management, if you do an employee of the month (or an employee of the year) program, this guy deserves it. Even though we live all the way across town now, we still make the 45 minute drive to come to GVR to place our bets and it is 100% because of him. He is the best bartender in town and, like I said, a really awesome person.   I will say too, I was sad today when we came in because he wasn't here, but we had the pleasure of being served by a guy named Tony who is also great! He was friendly and charming and prompt. Also, it didn't hurt that my Bloody Mary turned out nice and spicy :)   Thanks Tyler and Tony and GVR. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"We are in the aviation industry and travel frequently to Las Vegas.  We now finally found our place to stay for now on.  Top notch service with checking in, maid service, valet, but pool service needs more attention to the inexperienced staff (Biannca was pretty, nice, but way too inexperienced on service to detail).  Will stay here again.  Easy check in and check out.  Love how it's close to everything."}
{"text":"My girlfriends aunt lives in Henderson and this place is about 5min from her house.   When she told us, \"im going to take you guys to this great breakfast buffet,\" I automatically lit up.. I love breakfast and I love buffets.    We go this pretty large casino/resort (small compared to the ones on the strip) and head into the buffet area.      $4.99 for breakfast... that's cheaper than Denny's or IHOP.    I could not believe the variety of foods they had to choose from.  Usually Im used to seeing maybe 5 or 6 different items like pancakes, eggs, omelets, waffles and hash browns.  not here.  Basically if you can think of a breakfast item, they had it.    I filled my plate up with sausage/scrambled eggs, a cheese blintz, chicken fried streak, sausage, English muffin and a few other items.  After just one plate of food (and I didn't pig out, so don't freak out), I was stuffed, but so pleasantly stuffed.  The food was delicious!!  I guess not all good food is on the strip (that was sarcasm).  I loved this place and I cant wait to go back next time.  Heck for $4.99? Who could beat that?"}
{"text":"We stayed here last weekend for a cake camp.  The hotel is nice and clean.  It is not as crowded as the hotels in the strip.    The bad part is the rooms are a little bit dark. The fan in our bathroom is not working. I don't see any book in the room for the services that they offer in the hotel. The walls in the bedroom are thin, that you can hear people from the hallway. The front-desk are kinda rude. They don't give you a map of the area, it's kinda confusing to find your room. The buffet is almost/always the same. For a casino that accomodates kids, they don't have a drop in daycare. The pool can get really crowded that you won't be able to find a lounge chair to sunbathe.  They charge $150 minimum for those round sofas near the pool when you are already paying a $25 resort fee everyday. It took 30 minutes for those waitresses in the pool area to serve our drink.  We literally have to find our waitress so we can order a drink.  And they don't care because the gratuity is already added in every bill.  Overall the customer service in this hotel sucks!  Would I recommend this hotel to my fellow yelpers and friends?  Definitely, NO!   Would we go back there again? Nope, unless if they are going to use them again for cake camp."}
{"text":"This review is now based on the service I received today from the managers and front desk employees at Green Valley Ranch's Hotel. I have called 3 times today to finally receive my call back I was promised about the issue I had with unauthorized charges that were added to my account.   I was promised I would have copies of the documents I signed and never received a copy of at check in. Cyle, the manager promised I would have the documents yesterday emailed. Today he told me they would be sent, then in the same call told me that he needed to go to a different department to send the email since his email was down.   After waiting another hour I called for the third time today. He told me that he has sent the email. I have yet to receive an email. On the final call I was told that the charges would stand because security found ashes on the counter. I gave Cyle my fax number and still have not received any documents.   I can understand a charge for smoking in the room. I can honestly say that I requested a smoking room and had no idea I was in a non smoking room. I can not understand the games that are being played with getting me these documents.   I can not understand a $150 (deep cleaning) charge when I was already charged $100 for any incidentals. I really can't understand it because the front desk person who checked me in explained to me about the $100 deposit and had me sign.   I didn't get notified I was booked into a non smoking room. I wasn't notified about any charges that could happen beside the $100 deposit.  I may have signed for them but I didn't read the documents, they were read to me by the front desk person and she chose to leave some important details out.    If I would have never booked into this hotel I wouldn't have been put out an extra $250. Not to mention the money my friends and I spent in the Casino.   I've been coming here for over 10 years and I am sad to say I won't ever return to this property or any other station property. If I would have been called or emailed a receipt of these charges after they charged them I would have a different review.   Finding out that there has been $250 charged to your account without your knowledge is quite the shocker. Communication is lacking in their establishment.  I receive much better customer service at Motel 6. It tastes horrible saying that."}
{"text":"Unless I'm taking someone to Vegas who has never been, I refuse to stay on the strip. I just stayed at GVR for the first time last week and will probably be doing so again because it was pretty awesome. I'm still a huge fan of the M, but it seems like there's always an event happening at the M when I want to go which makes the rooms way too expensive. The room here was affordable, big, clean and nice enough (though just a bit stuffy decor wise).  The resort fee is pretty high (I think about $25night), but just keep it in mind when you look at the room rate - they clearly list it on their website when you're booking so it shouldn't be a surprise. It's handy that there is a mall type thing attached to give you more choices for dining that just what's inside the resort.  I could see the pool getting crazy busy on the weekends because it is a bit on the small side, but during the week it never filled up and is a really nice space. Use of the fitness center is also included in the resort fee, which was a big plus because really, with all the eating and drinking that happens in Vegas, a workout helps a lot.  The casino here wasn't super lucky for me, but that's fine, it just gave me more incentive to go relax by the pool and save myself the cash."}
{"text":"Just spent almost a full week at  GVR - Not a bad facility if you like to gamble.   Not much else going on in the winter.  You have to go through the lobby to get to the pool area if you are in the west wing of the hotel.   It seems that the west wing and east wing are isolated.  You can't get into the east wing with your west wing key card.  I had friends in the east wing and had to call them to be admited by them to the wing.  Be prepared to do a lot of walking., everything leads you through the casino area.  Hank's is an overpriced  steak joint.   The best place to eat was the Cafe.  Second place was the Tides Sushi bar.  DIdn't try the buffet... Nothing to do within walking distance.  The shuttle only runs every two hours to the LV strip and airport.   Customer service is so so."}
{"text":"I was recently invited to drink some whiskey with some friends and acquaintances. I know pretty much nothing about whiskey. One of my former UNLV computer science classmates was in town, staying at the Green Valley Ranch, so his suite became our venue.  I had never been inside any of the rooms before, but I was pretty impressed. Granted, this was a suite, but I'm sure each of the rooms is equally well-decorated. It's not the same style, but I'd say it was every bit as nice as the Bellagio suite I once had the pleasure of staying in. Getting to the rooms is a bit of a maze. OK maybe not that bad, but it reminded me of the Venetian. This is good because it separates the rooms from the casino portion of the property.  As for the GVR property as a whole, it's been overshadowed by newer places, but it's still a good local casino. It still has a nice beach area, a decent buffet, and the standard amenities like a movie theater and food court."}
{"text":"Very gorgeous hotel but restaurants are a little too expensive for a locals place. The shows are good there yellow brick road and steel panther. The pool is great but last Saturday they kicked us out at 4 to host a wedding and rushed us out and I had a tab running."}
{"text":"GVR overall is a pretty amazing casino! The movie theatre is very elegant and the arcade is fun! The restaurant selection is vast, however, the buffet is not the best. The staff is really friendly here and they're always greeting folks with a smile! I'd recommend this place as a whole, just don't eat at the buffet!"}
{"text":"I can comment only on casino because that's all I visited....went to place sports book bets and bet $100 and immediately after I made last bet showed Station players club....clerk said she wouldn't take it...I said I just forgot it for a second....she said no because system won't accept....I said I wanted to cancel bets and try again....immediately...she said it couldn't be done.....LAME. I don't see how it can't be done....simple void the tickets immediately which I tried to do.   I went someplace else for a while....returned later in the evening to cash bets....and did not spend another dime there.  Probably should not have bothered with players club because with 5,000 points you only get $5 off Fatburger or whatever"}
{"text":"This is a very nice locals casino. I love to visit the movie theater and they usually put on fireworks shows for special holidays. The facility is very clean. It doesn't have a local casino vibe to it at all, it feels a lot more upscale."}
{"text":"This casino is about 20 minutes off the strip in Henderson, NV. A lot of the young casino workers and locals work here and play here. Its a nice casino which feels more like a resort than a Strip casino. I like it because the club here is always good and the gambling here is more.. i dunno. homey. Ne ways, this is a good place to watch a show or something, too. Come here when you think you've done everything there is to do in Las Vegas. You won't be disapointed."}
{"text":"I have been back about 4 times since my last review. It seems like they stepped it up a notch. The food has been good and fresh. I always have 2 for one coupons and this is the place my daughter wants to go. Good job,"}
{"text":"If you are a player and typically have a status with reward programs at the upper tiers this is not the place that you want to gamble. They have the absolute worse reward program. I have president status and have never been assigned a host. I have been comped for a meal exactly once in ten months. Anything you get in this place you earn and pay for with your points. Hosts are invisible I have tried to contact one at the awards center and none respond to calls from their own reward center, of course this probably the plan if you can't contact them they don't have to decline or use their canned phrase I can't do anything for you. Email contact with the director of the rewards program produced no results. The player development program and its manager are not responsive. I have spoken with several friends President and chairman tier status and they confirm that GVR is the worst. I am a diamond with Ceasars and I am constantly receiving offers for rooms, shows and special events. When I do stay at one of the properties I rarely pay for a meal or a show it's always comped. Stations likes to say we love locals and haven't seen the love. My advise spend your money elsewhere. You will find it will  be much appreciated somewhere else."}
{"text":"Just a few minutes away from the Vegas Strip is this relaxing getaway. We stayed for the night after an exciting weekend on the \"strip\". We enjoyed an overnight stay and spent the next morning roaming the exquisite grounds: spas, pools, vineyards waterfalls, sand beach pool, hair salon... Casino and restaurants. We will absolutely return for a weekend retreat. The casino did not even smell of smoke! The restaurants are top notch and the resort has all the amenities of a fine place to stay.. 4 Diamond Resort. Beyond Stars rating. Truly a place to remember."}
{"text":"Staid in 2 rooms and spent time in a third (1 Tuscan Suite, 1 executive suite, 1 standard double Queen).  The resort is sprawling. It's nicely landscaped and nicely appointed.   First we had difficulty just finding the entrance using our GPS. Don't park in any parking lots just keep driving around the miles long perimeter until you find the front hotel entry on Carnegie St.  The entry is beautiful (though don't look close at the details as everything is cheap fakes made to look nice -- but that suffices for me).   In my case we were bumped up (at a cost of $200 additional per night) to the Tuscan Suite from a double queen room. However, in order to do that they had to move those guests (our children) to a different tower. That didn't work for us so we downgraded our second room from an Executive Suite (which we briefly checked into and I can say is definitely not worth any more than a standard room) to a double Queen.  The double Queen room was nice and in the East Tower overlooking the pool. But we were charged for an Executive Suite. On check out I was told that although the invoice was \"confusing, we were not charged for the suite\". However, when I arrived home and checked with the credit card charges I could see that we were indeed charged for the Executive Suite. 3 phone calls over the past 3 weeks each had the same result. \"A manager will call back, here is a confirmation number. No manager or anyone ever calls back. :(  The Tuscan Suite is dramatic to walk into and very nice. But really, with just 1 king bed I can't imagine the value of an 8 person dining room table and giant living room -- other than just gaudy fun, which we did appreciate!   The 'Feast Buffet' was somewhere between OK and not OK. The food was not kept fresh or neat at the self serve stations. The food itself was more like poor quality cafeteria food. Each of us found something we could eat but it was not a pleasant meal. The smoke from the casino was too much for my kids in the buffet. Since we had free dinner and breakfast vouchers, we did eat there for both those meals.  Getting to anything other than the pool area (the food, movies, arcade, outdoor mall) requires going through the smokey casino. If you smoke it's no problem. If you don't and don't enjoy the smokey stench this isn't a great casino.  The pool area is just OK. The sand area is nice, I think, for young children (mine are teens and steered clear of all the little kids there). Definitely do NOT rent a cabana there -- I was quoted $350 for the day (no partial day rentals). They are hotter than just laying out under an umbrella, have poor service, and are inconvenient to the main pool.  Main problem with the pool is that the pool closes at 7 pm!!!  At 6:45pm I saw a family with 3 kids in swim suits carrying pool toys arrive in the lobby only to be told that while it was 100 degrees and sunny outside the pool was closing -- not for some unavoidable technical reason but as standard hotel policy. :/ The kids were all whining and the father looked miserable. The pool security guard said that it was so the guests would spend money in the hotel and casino. If you plan on gambling while your spouse and/or children enjoy the pool forget it. You will be having to find other entertainment for everyone. The outdoor mall shops are closed so it's the strip, downtown or to bed.  Getting around in the hotel is a hassle because it is so sprawling. Getting to our room took 2 separate elevator rides in two buildings. It limits what can be accomplished in a day when getting to and from the room is so cumbersome.  On our way back home we did stop at the M to get breakfast. That casino seemed worlds nicer and had no cigarette smell. That would be my next go to place if staying off strip.  At the Green Valley Ranch, the rooms were comfortable, the service friendly, the beds very comfortable, the pool and restaurants fair to poor.  As for being charged for an Executive Suite while receiving a standard double Queen room, well 3 unreturned calls is enough for me. If they are not interested in charging the correct amount, I just won't return. It's a matter of about $300. Something I'll remember before booking at a Station Casino again."}
{"text":"Taking advantage of the recent Travelzoo Spa and Pool package, was both good and bad. The spa was wonderful, the staff fantastic. The pool is a completely different story. For years, we have been to the pool area for celebratory events like Mother's Day, Father's Day, and Birthdays taking advantage of the locals appreciation that Station Casino offered for using their pool (with a fee), bar and food service. NEVER had it been properly staffed, whether it was busy or empty. On Sunday, September 23, there was no staff at the towel kiosk. We grabbed our own towels and seated ourselves. There was no attendant around to kindly ask to move the only available umbrella to a spot that had more chairs to accomodate our group.  We waited for service. Finally a cocktail server arrived, and we asked her  for assistance moving the umbrella. (One of us could not be in direct sun.) She said we had to find one that was available (we already had) and then said no one was there to help us move it. \"That we would have to do it ourselves.\"  I said, \"you have to be kidding. I would injure myself trying to move it, and then struggle while trying to figure out how to open the umbrella shade!\"  I asked her to please try and find someone. She handed us one menu (we were four people) and said she would try. Ten minutes later, a guy comes to move the umbrella, struggling himself to open it and get the latch hooked! What liability the hotel was under should I have gotten injured trying to move such a heavy thing and then attempt to open it! Obviously the staff isn't aware of that issue!   I can tell you that each visit to the pool area has shown less and less that the casino appreciates locals. Originally a fee was charged per person to use the pool area with the cost going towards bar and food service. Then they instituted a fee to use the pool area with no credit for using the bar and food service. Then they eliminated locals from using the pool area on a holiday weekend, (That must have come about following the terribly understaffed and extremely poor service on Mother's Day 2012, even running out of water bottles and giving our order to someone else.)   On another note, Hanks welcomed customers for half priced martinis from 5 - 7pm everyday. That has since been changed to 4 - 6pm, with no advertising the change. So when in August 2012 I arrived at 6pm, I got the half price but my girlfriend who arrived at 6:10pm did not. They refused to honor the half price saying that the change was on their website. How many locals go to their website, come on!! Where is the appreciation for regular locals?    Good thing they no longer promote, \"We Love Locals.\"  They have really dropped the ball on that one."}
{"text":"Hotel is a scam! They get you at a low rate and keep tying to sell you an upgrade to get what you paid for. Ding you again with a $25 plus tax \"resort\" fee a day. Took 20 Minute's from hotel lobby to our outdated room overlooking busy parking lot. Front desk does not know what customer service is. Rude untrained staff. Do yourself a favor and book another hotel."}
{"text":"Was a great time there  Staff was great Can't wait to go back Food was good  Rooms were the best so far in Vegas  Could use a coffee pot in the room I'll be back"}
{"text":"As a Las Vegas local I frequently have family and friends in from out of town. Station Casinos properties are where I direct my family and friends to stay as they typically provide a great Vegas experience without paying strip prices. In the case of this review my wife and I rented a room at GVR on Fri Jun 12th, 2015 for our niece who just graduated from high school with honors to stay in as a night away for herself. She also completed her Civil Air Patrol duties and is about to join the Air Force as an Officer so this was another way of saying thank you to her for all that she has accomplished. Little did we know that hotel staff and security was about to violate their own policies and ruin her experience through utter stupidity. Approximately an hour after arriving and getting settled in, hotel security knocked on the door and demanded that they vacate the room. Then since our name was on the reservation along with hers and she is of legal age to be there the hotel front desk called and asked us to come over to the property but no explanation was given as to why.   On our way there we called the hotel and asked to speak with the manager on duty. We kept being put on hold. When we got there my wife finally got to speak to the manager on duty, Ross, who honestly does not have a clue about Station Casinos Corporate Policies, and that in fact the reservation that was made was valid and fully complied with the hotel policy to the very last detail. When confronted with the fact that he violated corporate policy and subjected our niece and her friend to public embarrassment and humiliation, instead of an apology we got stammering and expressions of ignorance. My niece was allowed to return to the room, but the special night away that she earned was ruined by hotel staff that does not even know their own policies and procedures. Those same policies and procedures are even posted on the Station Casinos website so there is no excuse whatsoever for the staff to not know their policy when it should be available to them internally and it's always available externally on their public facing website.   I take my online reviews seriously, so when I post a 1 Star review and put them on my negative lists, you can bet it was earned and that I'm following up with corporate. What happened tonight with our reservation....and yes it's my name on the credit card that paid for it...is totally unacceptable and redress in the form of an apology is demanded. This nightmarish public spectacle of pathetic hotel management comes less than 3 weeks after I had another stay at GVR that was absolutely incredible. I know what the staff at GVR is capable of, and that's what makes this even more appalling. This is one of Station Casinos flagship properties. The on duty manager needs to run it like a flagship, and if he can't do it perhaps he can find a job running an extended stay property on Boulder Highway instead.   1 Star...and the review will stay up until this is made right."}
{"text":"Wonderful. Beautiful and that is just the outside of this resort. Wonderful staff from the moment you arrive. The Valet service is first class. The check in was a easy process. The rooms are beautiful. Wander outside and check out the palm trees and the pool and the pond. This place is an escape. The décor is super chic and hip. And go up to the 2nd floor and hit the casinos.  Enjoy being away from home."}
{"text":"Came here this morning for my VETERAN'S Day buffet.  After standing in one line, i was sent to another line, after waiting there i was told to go to a Kiosk, which wouldn't issue the coupon"}
{"text":"This place is everything at the same time --- hip, cool, comfy and casual.  We used to watch the show that featured the Green Valley Ranch, I think it was called, \"American Casino.\"  In fact, we recognized quite a few employees from the show. Anyhow, when my husband had to travel here for a conference the rest of the family tagged along.  The rooms were spacious and beautiful. The kids enjoyed the huge pool, the comfy soft beds and the chocolate chip pancakes at the Original Pancake House.   This was a very easy place to stay with kids.  The staff was very nice and accomodating. We felt spoiled! There were also lots of things to do with the kids--many within walking distance too!  The nearby shopping plaza had outdoor music,  there was a chocolate factory tour a short distance away and the most fun of all, the hotel beach/pool.  A great time was had by all!  Check 'em out at: http://www.greenvalleyranchresort.com/"}
{"text":"We have stayed here a few times and had the same complaints and same likes each time. The lack of signage is awful...you can't tell where to turn in for valet, trying to find how to get to the correct elevator for your room is impossible, etc. The pluses include the friendly staff, nice rooms and EXCELLENT steakhouse , Hank's. Overall we enjoy staying here, we just know we're gonna be lost the majority of the time."}
{"text":"I just attended a conference there for the first time and this is a very nice off-strip resort-style hotel. The grounds are kept up very well and the interior of the lobby and rooms are nice. I didn't gamble here, but ate at Hanks Steakhouse, which was excellent, both in service and food.   My one complaint is their \"bait and switch\" tactic for room rates. When I called for room under my conference rate, they said rooms at that rate weren't available so I had to pay $40 more. OK fine. Then when I arrived on Sunday night, they asked if I still wanted a king bed room, which is what I signed up for in my reservation. When I said yes, they said there were none available, so I could have a room with two beds or they could \"give\" me an upgrade to a larger room with a king. Well, the upgrades they could \"give\" me were either $50 or $75 more on top of my already higher rate. The room was bigger, but it overlooked the roof of one of the parts of the hotel, and they are really subtle on how they ask if I still want that kind of room. The point is I eventually paid over $100 more than what I originally should have because of how they managed this at check-in. Maybe since they know this is a business trip, they figure you are not so conscious of rates going up that much. Plus, it was a Sunday night, so I doubt they could have been that full.   Another compliment though is during checkout, the line had about 12 guests in it and only two people working at the desk. It took a while to get another person to work the desk, but they gave bottles of water to everyone in line. Not a really big deal, but most hotels don't even do that."}
{"text":"This was my first time staying off strip, and needless to say, I was very impressed. Unfortunately the trip got off on a bad start here, but the manager was nice enough to accomodate and try to remedy the situation. We checked in around 5:30 and was told that our rooms were not ready yet. Hm.... interesting. Considering that check in was between 3pm and 6pm, and it was half an hour from 6... someone in logistics was probably going to lose his job. We weren't happy at all with their suggestion that it was going to be an hour+ wait at least for them to clean our room. Not too happy with that, but in the end, with the food/drink credit and tuxedo chocolate covered strawberries that were sent to our room, I was in a happy place.   The resort is fairly new, but has the decor of the old school \"western-ish\" style.   The best part of this place, was by far the pool area. I really really enjoyed the huge HUGE beds that were placed around the lounge and pool area for you to lay out on. Came with a ton of fluffy pillows too!!  Great place to play, bet minimums were low and the food was good and cheap. It was a great combination - the luxury of new Vegas, but with old school prices!"}
{"text":"Never again....I have tried this place twice now.  First time was a NYE party and now just to hang out and gamble.  Each time sucked!  I got suckered into bottle service for 500 bones and now just dropped 100 bucks at keno.  What a complete waste of time.  Also, why didn't anyone tell me there was a freakin loer yuppie convention in town???"}
{"text":"I grew up in Green Valley and used to frequent the movie theater but the first time I stayed here was right after college graduation in 2003 and now I won't stay anywhere else. The rooms are elegant and comfortable. I love the fact that they have plush bathrobes, slippers, a nice vanity, a full wet bar, a Bose alarm clock radio with custom loungey CD mix... everything I could want, really. The bathtub is nice & comfortable and I love hotels with toilets separate from showers but the best thing about the bathroom is the television speakers so you don't miss what's going on in the suite. Love, love, love it. Front desk, door service, and valet have always been fantastically polite and accommodating. Aside from the time the concierge almost sent me to the Fashion Show Mall for an Apple Store when there was one 10 minutes away.   One of the better ventilated casinos in Vegas and I never come home without visiting the District-- a great addition to the Ranch."}
{"text":"OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews (bad girl, BAD GIRL!), so to make it up to ya'll, I am now embarking on a casino-by-casino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises - eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesn't move.  Got it? OK, let's proceed...  Review #44: this is a nice well-kept property, but could really use a little burst of fun & modernization; this appears to be coming soon with the planned opening of Pizza Rock in March, and potential longer term opening of Mercadito & its sister bar Tipple; miles of slot machines here for the locals; meeting rooms on 2 floors; also has a 10-screen theater; I like how the hotel area & check-in is segregated on a lower floor, and is quite serene & classy, including the cool bar off of the lobby; the real shining star at Green Valley is the outdoor/pool area, which looks fab; you can also walk across the street to shopping & some eateries like Elephant Bar; the sports book is impressive & regal; probabaly a 3.5 stars property, but I'll kick them up to 4 in anticipation of Pizza Rock opening soon; best craft beer bet = it's pretty bad right now, but Pizza Rock should change that if it's anything like the downtown LV location.  BTW, did I mention that Pizza Rock is opening here soon??  It's kind of like the promised land..."}
{"text":"So many times I have been to GVR..why is it I never reviewed it? Well last night we were there and found out that they love locals. Thats what the sign said and below that it said they had 99 cent margaritas at the sports book bar. So off we went to find these cheap drinks. We were very surprised at how tasty they were. Our bartender Doug was such a great guy. He hooked us up! They were lime flavored but you could get strawberry ones for 1.50. Such a great deal. Locals love GVR! At least this local does.."}
{"text":"WOW.  If you have ever read a positive review on the Green Valley 'Ghetto' it is false.  My family spent 5 days there last week based upon reviews and it was a dump in all aspects.  Our hotel room had stained carpet (everywhere) along with stained curtains and a moldy bathroom. The Casino has a serious ventilation problem and all you can smell is smoke and a weird body odor stench.   My entire family came home with a serious skin rash that either came from the pool or the beds. Speaking of the pool area, its a dump and boring. They have a small sand areas for kids but that is it. No activities, no slides, nothing. The outdoor sound system is literally one speaker on the south end of the pool.  When it comes to food, the entire casino sells Denny's type low end food but at high prices. Its a total joke. The buffet is awful and overcrowded.  The best part is the theatre but that as well is run down.  If you are planning a trip to Vegas, avoid this dump!"}
{"text":"Overall a nice place. The staff is friendly and the rooms are clean. The Italian restaurant is very good but only open for dinner.  The pool closes at 6PM which I can not comprehend. The pool is wonderful and would be great to be enjoyed after the brutal desert sun has set."}
{"text":"Green Valley is great escape from the madness of the strip. It's located about 15-20 min away but it has a good atmosphere. It has a beach pool hybrid so you can enjoys both....my daughters loved it. There is a strip mall just outside the hotel(literally across the street) so can enjoy a stroll to kill some time. There are also a few sit down food joints that is good around the hotel."}
{"text":"Traveling to Vegas for a work trip and was excited to stay in Henderson where our store is located. After doing some research I was excited to find this resort. I have not even stepped foot in the Resort and will not have the opportunity too because their website is not accurate nor is their online booking. I tried to book about 10 times because it said they had rooms available but after calling twice and taking to a reservation specialist, they have no rooms available. Update your site!! I only gave two stars because the ladies who I spoke with were very nice but of course they are off site and not affiliated directly with the Resort."}
{"text":"Checked In late on a Friday 5/10/13.  I was given a room on the first floor.  I kindly asked if there were any other rooms and without checking I was told no.  I was given room 6110 and the lady that checked me in looked like work was the last place she wanted to be at the time.  She had a bad attitude. I did not feel welcome at all. Boooooo.  Once we got to the room we realized that it was a smoking room but I had reserved a non smoking room.  It was already late so we just dealt with it.  The next morning I went to the lobby to ask for a different room because of the smell of smoke in our room.  The lady at the front desk immediately checked and switched our rooms.  Her customer service was outstanding I believe her name was Olivia.  I almost gave GVR 2 stars but the customer service on Saturday convinced me to up it to a 3.  Overall the hotel and casino were nice.  A bit smoky.  There were a lot of clearly intoxicated/rowdy patrons on Friday night but on Saturday evening it was a whole different crowd.  Much more relaxed."}
{"text":"Beautiful place! Really enjoyed staying here. Room was comfortable and had everything I needed during my stay. Wish the pool was bigger though. It was jam packed for memorial day weekend. Enjoyed eating at the Grand Cafe and Pizza Rock. They have a great bingo place inside. Would definitely recommend this place and would stay here again. A+"}
{"text":"Absolutely the Best! Been here numerous times. With this last week being one of the best times yet. Thank you for a very memorable getaway."}
{"text":"CONFUSING!! this hotel really has no idea what's going on. I understand that the casinos are supposed to be confusing to keep people gambling but the general layout of the hotel is like a maze with no help from the unfriendly staff as to directions. Room service food is horrible. All the cocktail waitresses are old and beat up.  On top of everything they screwed up my bill, mis charged me and the guests who were beside me in line. Total chaos.   I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Complete customer care. Vinny Denovellis in security is a true asset to your company. Went over and beyond to help locate an item I left at dinner. He followed up, and made sure I got my item back. I'm beyond grateful. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Ok so am I bitter because this place is really not the closest to be. Ok so there's NEVER any parking that's close - everyone and their mothers go here. I've been here a few times where I'd have to drive circles for parking. Buffet is good. Movie theatre - decent. Everything else....eh....I can see it get old fast. I mean they did a whole reality show on this property called American Casino. I'm just not impressed with this place. The pool is nice! It smells clean....this place is just not my thing. Plus I've never really won playing there. Am I just bitter? Nahhhh Red Rock is way better. GVR comes at an easy 2nd!"}
{"text":"Love having a few cocktails and playing video poker in the main bar. Easy parking on level 3 of garage.  Doors lead right from 3rd floor parking into the casino. *** WARNING *** The coffee drinks are extremely hot!"}
{"text":"******CASINO REVIEW ONLY******  I've never stayed at the hotel so I'm writing this review strictly on the casino. It is by far my favorite casino in the Las Vegas area. Now, I should admit that I never play slots, and no, not because I think they're for \"suckers\" I just don't enjoy them. (Let's be honest, if you gamble at all... you're a bit of a sucker... these places aren't made of solid gold for no reason :-) Back to business; right when I walked in, I knew that it was going to be my kind of place. It's never ridiculously crowded. The drink servers greeted me right away and took my order. The table limits allow you to play at the level YOU decide you are comfortable with. Also, if you're a dice player, this is the only casino in Nevada that I've noticed has a Fire Bet. There is a great, reasonably priced food court if you want to grab a bite to eat and don't feel like taking out a 2nd on your house. It really is the ONLY place I feel comfortable gambling at in Nevada. 5 stars for the Jolly Green Giant.   Regards, CFC"}
{"text":"We went to the GVR Buffett and Christine Franklin was our server and she was absolutely amazing and efficient. She made sure we were taken care of and made us feel comfortable. I'll always ask for her now!"}
{"text":"I called the spa at the GVR yesterday to make an appt. for a massage for my lady for Mothers Day. , the receptionist was very nice , I booked a spot for 1 pm . My plan was to hang at the pool with her until her appt. and then be at the pool with lunch ready when she was finished. It occurred to me I better see what the policy was as far as admission for locals to the pool because if we couldn't get in the pool then I wasn't doing the spa treatment . I called GVR and I asked the woman on the phone about entry to the pool , she asked \" are you a registered guest , I explained that I wasn't, I was a local and I told her about my plan for the day . She told me it was 20 dollars for admission to the pool Monday thru Friday . I reminded her that Mothers day was on Sunday and she instantly replied \" oh , then you cant come to the pool\" I tried to reason with her and better understand their policy but she was rude and just didn't have time for me. It left me no choice but to cancel my spa appt. It is disappointing that a \" locals Casino\" doesn't welcome \" locals business. Between the Spa, Lunch, and cocktails and gambling afterwards , I know I would of been dropping at least 1000. bucks that day. I called the 'M\" resort and they were more than happy to welcome us to the spa and the pool. Looks like GVR will not be getting any of my money in the future. So much for a \" Locals spot \" Shame on you GVR  .."}
{"text":"I love gambling here more than the strip! This place pays out more imo. And they have a pretty decent Buffet. :)"}
{"text":"Green Valley Ranch is a great place to stay and is a very nice upscale resort away from the strip! It is very different staying there than any other Casino or resort on the strip. It is quiet and they have a beautiful pool! There is a real sand beach that leads into the swimming pool that kids just love. The pool is also very warm and nice. I have stayed at Green Valley Ranch several times and the other thing I love is the Spa. The use of the Spa is typically included with your room. They have a nice Sauna, and Steam Room, and Hot Tubs. But the other nice thing the Spa has is a Spa pool separate from the main pool. There is also a great Arcade and a Movie Theater as well, which makes staying at Green Valley great for families. I'm not a huge fan of their Buffet. But Pizza Rock makes the best Pizza in the world, i'm not kidding!!! I was also not overly impressed with Hanks. Hanks is a very high end Steakhouse. But for the price it wasn't that great compared to other places you can go to in Las Vegas. My Steak was pretty tough and chewy and overcooked. For a $250 meal you would expect better.  There are also a lot of nice restaurant options at the shopping district right next door. The rooms are nice, especially the bathroom with a nice Tub and separate shower. Overall it is a great, classy place to stay away from the busy strip. Sometimes we like to stay on the strip and have fun for three days, and then go stay a couple nights at Green Valley to relax!!"}
{"text":"I really like the design of this place. tastefully decorated with earthy tones and scrolled metal work. I didnt try any of the food so i cant say anything on that point. There is a movie theatre downstairs...which is nice its separate from the casino upstairs. This location is also surrounded by what appears to be a nice selection of shopping and eating. Will have to check that out next time."}
{"text":"Buffet, YUM!! Take your steamed crabs cold shrimp raw oysters corn potatoes whatever suits your fancy to the grill and spice it up!!"}
{"text":"Stayed here in March of 2011 with my parents.  Rooms and hotel are top notch, service was great, lobby was beautiful.  Pool and landscaping were very nice it reminded me of a southern plantation, not sure exactly how else to describe it, but I liked it a lot so two thumbs up to the designer.  I will most definitely return to this hotel when I'm in Vegas again.  It's amazing what a different vibe you get when you are off the strip."}
{"text":"The hotel ground is really pretty.  My son and I loved the pool and he loved the Kids Quest.  The casino is nice (although I wish it was non smoking).  We loved that there were so many food options like Starbucks and other quick service places to grab a bite.   The grounds are beautiful and our room was in the East Wing.  The only thing I noticed was that the floors did not seem to have been vacuumed when we checked into our room.  There was a candy wrapper on the floor.  Also, the pillow cover smelled like perfume.  Not sure if the maid wore perfume while we was making the bed and so the smell transferred or they did not change the pillow cover from the last occupants (which I'm going to not think about because that would FREAK me out).  I ended up throwing those on the floor and using one that didn't smell like perfume.  The pillows were also too fluffy/thick for my liking.  And it seemed all the pillows were that way.   The pool is really great for kids, the chaise have a comfy fleece type cover and plenty of fresh towels and even cold water by the pool.   The staff is really nice and check in/out easy.  The bell hops, valets were all fast and easy. There are some cons I would recommend to the hotel.  This morning, the Starbucks in the main hotel lobby only had one person working.  Line was so long and a few people just left because the wait was too long.  Considering it was prime morning/breakfast time, totally unreasonable to have 1 person being the cashier, barista.   The other thing I noticed was that someone's room service food left out of the hallway sat outside in the hall for HOURS (probably 6-8 hours) before it was taken away.  Staff should come by after people order food to check and take it away. Also, the other people staying at the hotel walk and talk loudly while walking past your room.  I heard them as the loudly walked by talking/screaming.  Either the soundproofing isn't great or there were just inconsiderate people when we were there.   Finally, wish the shuttle that takes us to the strip went further than just Mandalay.  There should be 1 more stop further up the strip for those going to Bellagio or further up.  We took the shuttle then had to walk so much to get to Bellagio and then the cab back (because we didn't want to wait for the next  shuttle that runs only in 2 hour increments) was pricey.  $40 at like 9:30pm on a weekday. The rooms in the East Tower can use some updating but the hotel itself is really nice."}
{"text":"This place is great, the food at the buffet was diverse and amazing. The seafood buffet was exceptional as was the service everywhere.  The rooms are very well kept and the staff is eager to help with events,  directions or suggestions.   Entering and exiting the resort is simple and efficient, we took Uber everywhere and never waited more than 4-6 minutes.   I went to play craps the last night and hadnt played in a long while. The staff was eager to help with how to bet and in explaining the game. Started with $100, left with $635.  My biggest shout out is to the main lobby bartender Kelly, she was super friendly rembered our names and drinks and displayed amazing professionalism.   All in all way better than the strip and very cost effective. We will definately be back."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my girlfriend.  She was talking me out for my belated birthday.  We parked at the spa parking lot.  I didn't get to see inside the resort, only the spa and pool area.  I'm impressed it was so clean and pretty.  I loved the spa pool area, it's super quiet.    The reason for the minus two stars is because we were told when we checked into the ladies room that they will come grab us for the facials.  We said ok, we'll be at the pool.  There was no waitress to order drinks for the hour we were there....well the waitress came about 30 minutes in and asked if we're good.  We asked her for a menu, it took her 15 minutes to give us a menu, then she never returned.  That was when we realized our facial is about to start and no one came to grab us.  They didn't tell us we have to be in a certain area.  They said they'll have the esthetician grab us.  There wasn't anyone else there with us at the pool until 35-40 minutes into us laying out there.  The communication was off.  I'll have to try it again another time.  Hoping to update this to a 5 stars! =)"}
{"text":"Very nice place to stay. Buffet line was very long, about 30 min wait in the VIP line and was just OK. The rooms are large. very nice decor. The people were very nice. The kids loved the pool with the sandy beach walk-in. my only neg was that the sink had a huge crack in it and the drain was very slow. Oh and I was a little sticker shocked by the $7, 12 oz. lemonade at the pool. No wonder there are no prices on the drink menu."}
{"text":"This place is an oasis just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip. But this place provides plenty of hustle and bustle of its own.  The hotel: My friend and I were lucky enough to get a comped suite overlooking the pool. This room was absolutely incredible. The beds were superb. Luxurious bathrooms. Great room service.   The casino: Ohmygod we had so much fun with everyone we met at the 3-card poker table. My friend's the gambler, I just sat by her side talking to everyone at the table and drinking. We were at this table for hours. In fact, we were so wired - we didn't go to bed until after 5am. Good times. And good people.  The rest: Exccellent dining. Beyond the food court offerings, of course.  Sushi + Sake: excellent!  Il Fornaio: gnocchi and salads were delish! Whiskey Bar: we were there early but the layout was pretty cool. Fun bartenders.  I'll never forget the 24 hours we spent here."}
{"text":"As a couple with two small children, its often difficult for my husband and I to find a place that makes everyone happy. Green Valley Ranch, however, is the perfect location as it provides adult entertainment and activities/entertainment for children as well. The hotel location is perfect in that it is close enough to the Strip to allow you to party at your will, while far enough away for you to truly be able to relax and enjoy without the hustle and bustle.   The really cool part is that the resort itself is sufficient for a fantastic vacation even without the Strip. The pool has a sandbeach for kids of all ages. The service is exemplary. The foods and drinks are \" To Die For.\"  Long story short...If you are looking for a 5 star vacation for you and your family, this is the place to be!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a total crock! BEYOND disappointed!!Their slogan is \"we love locals\"... they love locals so much they tried to charge me and my boyfriend $25 per person to go to the pool (acting like they were doing us a favor to let the 2 kids in for free) when last season it was free. Needless to say we took our business to South Point, which is a TRUE locals casino!"}
{"text":"This is a fairly upscale locals casino / high value tourist casino with quality restaurants. Have not tried the buffet here. The staff are generally friendly, and the decor is above average.  Decor 3/5 Staff 3.5/5 Value 2.5/5"}
{"text":"MY NEW HAPPY PLACE! In Vegas at least. i can't believe it's only now that I discover this hidden gem. Went on a staycation over the weekend and had a great time!  My favorite spots are the pool and the day beds. I love that the pool has sand, you feel like you're on the beach. Something we lack here in Vegas. I also love the area under the bridge where the seats are submerged in water. Perfect way to cool down in this summers heat. Our suite was also SWEEET! It was one of the nicer suites I have seen in the Valley. It was spacious, and super clean I felt so at home. It had a mini bar, a dining table huge enough to hold a meeting, a huge couch, huge bathroom and a nice tub.   The only thing I could think of that I didn't like was that the casino smells like cigarette but it's fine cause I didn't really go to that area that much.   Overall I would still give this place a 5 stars. It now is one of my favorite spots in town, and it has all the ingredients to a perfect STAYCATION. If you're a local, do yourself a favor and go experience GVR. :)"}
{"text":"Just finished our company meetings here and since I live in the area and stayed here before, figured it was time to write about it.....  1.  Hotel - Modern, clean, luxurious and far enough away from the casino that you are safely ensconced in a smoke free area.  Rates are a bit high, however, the luxury is worth it.  2  Meeting Rooms - All adjustable and very accommodating. Easy access from either the casino side or the hotel side.  Staff is great, food is great, they are real professionals.  3.  Entertainment - Besides the gambling, they have a small theater with smaller size screens.  Kids Area for video gaming.  Plenty of things to do for a family.  4  Food - Great food choices in the food court. Fatburger, Caproitti, U Swirl, Panda Express are all favorites. You have fine dining for sushi, chinese, steak, irish pub (liquid diet), and more. This place has a great selection.  5.  Ambiance - Upscale and classy.  Easy access and parking."}
{"text":"Came poolside yesterday and the crowd was here but we were able to get a couch at NO COST... return today and they're renting everything couches daybeds and cabanas totally understand the cabanas and daybeds but couches really"}
{"text":"Had a facial at the spa, and while it felt amazing at the time I woke up in the middle of the night with little blisters all over my face and now 3 days later have chapped, uncomfortable and irritated skin. The woman was very nice and asked me about allergies -- I have to admit I knew of none (that seemed to be part of the treatment provided). She noticed my skin was sensitive and recommended some skin care options that seem like good ones. I think in the end it must be very difficult to provide this service to people you have never seen and will never see again -- I enjoyed the experience, but wish I was not suffering so after.  PS the hotel is nice, but I'm not a casino person and did not like that I had to be apart of the casino experience to enjoy any of the restaurants. I was there for a conference -- not to gamble. I would have loved it if the bar and restaurant by the pool area had been open as it would have offered opportunity to not deal with the casino atmosphere (and smoke). We were however there 'off season' so outdoor venues were closed."}
{"text":"Speaking from a mom's point of view traveling with small children, I think this resort is very kid friendly. The pool is awesome with a small sandy beach area which is great for little kids. The location being right next to The District allows you more dining options should you not want to stay on the property. The rooms were nice and modern. Concierge has crayons, coloring books, cards and games for the kids...just ask.  The cons: The refrigerator is stocked with mini bar items which are sensored so if you move items, you will get charged. I should have asked to have the items removed so that it could be used to store milk for the kids. Although signs were posted stating the pool closes at 8PM, it was communicated to us by the bell person that it actually closes at dusk. We get to the pool at 5:20pm and the pool security tells us it closes at 6PM. They should just post signs stating \"Pool closes today at...\" Yeah, a few people who arrived just as we were leaving were really pissed off. I imagine they get complaints like this everyday, so why they don't change their policy is beyond me."}
{"text":"The Green Valley resort casino offers a top notch buffet experience at a very reasonable price. As a local I receive 2 for 1 coupons in my mail. Lunch is the better priced deal. Be careful as the lunch ends at 3. So we take full advantage by arriving between 1:30 and 2 pm. The best deal in the world...where else can 2 people eat for only $10.80 incl.tax. All the  selections are prepared to a very high quality standard. Of course everything is unlimited.  The Friday and Sat.nights are too over price and not worth the price. We only attend lunch from Sunday to Thu. The bread pudding is to kill for...don't miss it...leave enough room for all the great desserts."}
{"text":"i have never stayed here before but go here alot. the service is very friendly. the buffet is good and the pool area is beautiful. only bad thing is no more poker tourneys in the poker room. cash games only"}
{"text":"While staying in Vegas, we decided to drive to Henderson to check out the casino here. It's pretty nice, very well kept, all your favorite machines and easy parking. It's only maybe 12 miles from Vegas, it's worth the trip just to get away from the strip and relax. They have a nice food court, and several nice restaurants in the casino. It was WAY netter than MGM's \"Park\" (Monte Carlo) where we were staying. I don't know about the rooms, but check the casino out to kill some time or eat. Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely would stay here again.  When I was a local, my wife and I frequented this place often for dinner, gaming, and movies.  On a recent trip back to the Valley I decided to stay at GVR for a night.  Very glad I did.  The standard room is nice, larger than the standard room I had been in the previous three nights at Harrah's.  Great bathroom with a separate soaking tub and shower stall.  Also, the water closet is private from the rest of the bathroom, which is nice.  Comfortable bed, large TV with plenty of options.  This was a nicely appointed room.  GVR has a good sized casino for a locals' joint and most nights has plenty of $5 games.  I was there on a Sunday, I never saw more than one craps game going, although to be fair I didn't gamble much after 8:00 pm.  So, they may have opened another one later in the evening.  There is double deck pitch blackjack with good rules but only average penetration.    GVR has a couple of good restaurants:  Hank's, the steakhouse, and Tides, the oyster bar.  They are adding a Pizza Rock, which I like, so that will be another great addition.  The food court is standard fare for a Station Casino:  Fatburger, Capriotti's, Panda Express, Tropical Smoothie Café.  They are putting in another pizza joint, which seems redundant to me, but a place for quick slices is never a bad idea I suppose.  I've been to Grand Café, but it's been years.  That place was just average then, but like I said, it's been a long time.  The buffet is solid for a locals' joint, better than Sunset or Fiesta.  But, if I am going to consume that many calories, I want to make it worth it, so I'd drive to Caesars and eat Bacchanal.  Overall, I was very pleased with my stay at GVR.  I came here quite a bit as a local, and I can see myself coming back quite a bit now that I don't live in Vegas.  Recommended."}
{"text":"The massages I got at the spa were great, but they did start 10 minutes late. Maybe there plan was for me to for sure be stressed to start off. I would give a higher rating, but I mistakenly had an appointment at the hair salon right after. I was five minutes early for my blowout and I had to wait another 20 minutes. To make matters worse, the girl that did my blowout had been in the back chatting and I could see her. She was gossiping with another stylist and a friend of their's who had wandered in drunk from the pool area. Being late is bad enough but knowing they were just wasting my time because I could see it was worse. I tip for not only good service but TIMELY service. Unprofessional to keep people waiting. I would have left had there been ANY OTHER option."}
{"text":"Beautiful pool area and bar!  Super clean rooms and restful atmosphere.  Casino on-premises.  Full conference center available with shops and restaurants within walking distance.  20 minute cab ride to the strip.  Ask for a pool view room to avoid casino parking garage or interstat e view.  Can walk to plenty of shopping and dinner options - the locals come to this area to shop."}
{"text":"This hotel is absolutely gorgeous!  The staff is very friendly, the rooms are awesome... everything.  Awesome.  I can't wait to go back!!!  I think one of the main things I love, is that it's not far from the strip (20 min), but far enough that you can enjoy and relax without all the crazy noise.  Not that I'm not into having a good time, cause trust me, good times we DEFINITELY had hahah! But ya, it was the best of both worlds.  Hands down.  And if you stay here, or even near hear, you MUST goto Hank's Steakhouse.  Best meal of my life... Aww.. I miss Green Valley already. Boo"}
{"text":"I won a free room here on swipe and win. I booked the room as a comped room. Try advised I had to give 96 hours notice if I was going to cancel my room or they charge you $100 bucks. Now what kinda prize is that. I really wanted to cancel cause a member of my family got sick.. Ended up going to the hotel anyways so I didn't lose my prize or the $100"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Green Valley Ranch. The whole place is beautiful. It is my number 1 recommendation for anyone who comes to Vegas and doesn't want to stay on the strip. I can not tell you how many nights I've stayed there. Customer service is top notch.   There is already ton of places to eat in the resort but they are adding restaurants all the time it seems.   The pool and spa are on a whole another level. I love the pool and spa. From massages to hanging by the pool it is the place to be.   Love GVR and would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"We picked this hotel solely based on the fact we booked a fishing excursion for my dads 70th bday and it's closer to lake mead than the encore where I usually stay. The first place GVR failed me was the room, my wife and I are in our 30s yet the front desk in their infinite wisdom decides to put us into a room with a handicap bathroom stall with no place other than the floor to put shampoo conditioners etc. Although they advertise a close proximity to the strip , trust me it is not that close at least a min of 15 min drive sans traffic. Although I thought the food at the hotel was about average, my parents weren't impressed hence making it difficult on me since they insisted on eating most of our meals away from the hotel and as I mentioned earlier this hotel is not close to las Vegas blvd or spring mtn. But by far the worst thing about this place is horrible way they comp players, not sure how they get anyone to gamble here. I'm routinely comped my stays at the encore so you can imagine my surprise and disgust when the host said he could only barely take off one 70 dollar night of a 3 night stay after I played there over 5 hours a night averaging about 100 bucks a bet. On the other hand the craps dealers are very competent and friendly. We probably tipped them a few hundred total during our trip here, which makes it even more unconscionable how stingy the hosts were with the comps . Essentially mediocre food, inconvenient location, and super stingy casino hosts make this a very mediocre place to stay in the vegas area. With soo many better better choices within a 20 mile radius you probably would be doing yourself a favor by staying elsewhere especially if you are a table game player."}
{"text":"This is a great resort to bring the kids and have fun. It's a few miles from the strip so it's nice and quiet. Very relaxing. Staff is amazing. Lisa at the front desk was our favorite person! Maria at the buffet was so nice and the kids loved her. Casino wasn't too crowded and they even had a movie theatre onsite. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I loved coming to this place. I would come to the pool all the time because I'm a local. Have lunch get a few drinks...but then today I came and got turned away. They said that they do not let locals in anymore. I was just here a few days ago I told they girls. They said yeah the rules just changed, no more locals unless they are renting a cabana. Seriously...it's a Thursday morning...there is prob 10 people at the pool.  Two weeks ago when I asked if they charge to get in they said not during the week but on weekends we charge locals. I will be letting all my friends know so they will no further get any of our business."}
{"text":"Just. Called no longer open to locals unless you buy a cabana. They don't like locals it's just a lame slogan."}
{"text":"Decent casino for vacation or stay-cation....terrible machines...I've played most of the machines here and hit bonuses after bonuses and gives very small or close to nothing...From $5.00 to $10.00 bets, absolutely ridiculously tight machines...$20-30 range return on hard to hit bonuses....absolutely ridiculous...I wouldn't play slot machines here...Poker room is okay...but just like anywhere else I guess...1-2 tables left after midnight...nothing compare to Seven Mike Card Room in San Diego...Action 24/7...GVR buffet is 2 stars...it's okay if you're hungry but if you want a nice meal and good cooking...definitely not this casino...rewards are crap and again did I say RUN away from the slot machines....M Resort is a bit better...it's not far from here...I've hit 5 jackpots at M resort...every now and then at Southpoint Casino...but GVR??? this SOB is tight....I wouldn't recommend it..."}
{"text":"Tonight I came to GVR to meet a couple of buddies for a few drinks.  Green Valley Ranch is to me, the best comparison to a strip casino, off the strip (if that makes sense).  Basically speaking, it's the best off the strip casino.  This place is nice, clean and has a very classy vibe. I've been here for the buffet many times and it is very inexpensive.  The bathrooms are cleaned on a consistenty basis.  There's a lot of parking and I never find myself walking far from my parking.  I also think the neighborhood of Green Valley is awesome.  There's Whole Foods close by, Lucille's BBQ and best of all, my job is 2 minutes away.  In the casino, there's a great food court option, nice restaurants such as Terra Verde and Hank's Steakhouse and awesome bars like Quinn's and the Drop Bar.  Because it's close to my work and home, I find myself there a lot on weekends and I know theres a great weekend vibe amongst the locals."}
{"text":"Had an amazing spa day at Green Valley Ranch Resort.  It was incredible!! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Dear GVR,  As you know, I play poker almost every single day at your establishment. I have alot of friends who also play poker and other table games on a regular basis at GVR. I thought that I had become close with alot of the employees as well... So, I have to give you a warm Thank You for having security escort me out not once but Twice on Friday night. Thank you for having a taxi take me to a near by casino and dropping me off in their parking garage so I can get robbed!!! Thank you so so much for looking out for me!! Lets see... If you dont kick my ass out for NO reason, I still have my Chanel purse, $500, my dignity, self respect, hope for the future...need I go on?? Now, did I drink a little too much? Yes...However, having known me for 9 months, you know that I do not normally drink so much and I am certainly of no threat to anyone. I even called security the next day to apologize for the situation and did you ask me if I was OK or how you could help?? NO, you just told me that you have no idea what I am talking about and hung up! Perhaps next time I will get raped or murdered in your parked lot...All I asked was that you not kick me out when I clearly had no where to go and no idea how to function at that moment- but you did not GIVE A FUCK. I have heard people say that GVR has horrible customer service and now I understand. However, I think this goes very far beyond not having customer service...It is not having any regard for a human beings life and/or safety!!!!! So, my fellow patrons, If you value the life or your wife, girlfriend, mother, daughter etc and have a reasonable expectation that she will be treated with respect and dignity, then I would reconsider entering the doors at GVR..."}
{"text":"I have been here for spa day and absolutely love it. We also purchased a spa day for my mom and she can't wait to go back. Everyone is so helpful and friendly. I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"We really loved Green Valley Ranch.   Family from back east were attending a conference here, so we booked a room.   In the context of off strip and off Fremont, this is our new favorite hotel and casino.   We only spent one night, so the comments are limited to our limited exposure... but here they are:  1)  Our king room was awesome.  The bed, which normally disappoint us mainly because we are spoiled by our own, was wonderful.   The room was clean, the bath was clean and well appointed too.  Room size was good too.   Furniture was comfortable.   It was a great room for resting and taking breaks from gambling.  2)  The casino and staff were excellent.   The wife and I play craps and we've experienced many craps tables in NV.   The GVR tables are her favorites.   They are in my top five.  I also played Ultimate Texas Holdem.  Again the staff were great.  3)  The pool area was very nice... kind of a mini Mandalay Bayish, but more family friendly.     4)  The concierge service was excellent.   He booked us great tickets for the Jersey Boys in the Paris casino... no problems.   He also had great advice for the relatives that happened to match our experiences.   Perhaps our tastes were aligned.  5)  They permit uber drivers the same courtesy as taxis and limos.   Yep, the uber driver can pick you up and drop you off at the main entrance.   Uber is slowly gaining casino acceptance, but front entrance delivery and drop off is not universal in Las Vegas yet.  6)  We only had one meal on location and it was very good.   We experienced the Sunday Champagne Brunch in their buffet restaurant.   The food quality was higher than other Vegas and Henderson buffets.   Many of the items we choose were single plate quality as if they did not come from a buffet.   Very surprised.   We tried to cash in our free margarita at the Mexican restaurant, but our timing was off.   They opened at 4PM and closed at 11PM.   Too bad, it has a nice bar close to the table games...  We'll be back.   The resort is now our go to place."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great luxury rooms - very clean, nice pool with man made beach for the kids. I especially love the reggae band that played on Saturdays. FUN, FUN, FUN! A little over priced, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"The moment you walk into the hotel reservation lobby to check in, you feel the luxury from the hotel. It is clean and grand, and the service from everyone working here is great. One in particular was an individual named Mike, who walked us from the hotel's parking garage to the check in lobby. I had expected him to point us in the direction of the lobby, but he went above and beyond to walk us over. This happened again the day we were checking out, luckily we ran into Mike again! The property is not hard to navigate but some of us get turned around easily so it's helpful to know there are workers around the floor here to help.   The hotel rooms are large and grand, I especially enjoyed the bathrooms that come with a soaking tub and stand up shower with a separate room housing the toilet! Perfect where individuals can still get ready and use the mirrors while another person is in the toilet room.   The hotel also has several food and beverage options in their food court located on the casino floor, such as Panda Express, Starbucks, auntie Anne's pretzels, and upscale restaurants!   The reason for one less star is that we were told we would be able to check in early at 11am when we called prior, however when we arrived, we were told our room was not ready yet. They have a service where they could text you when your room is ready (cool!) but our room was not ready until close to 3:30. A little disappointing when the hotel front desk tells us one thing and we end up having to wait an extra 4 hours until the room is ready. We had asked for a late check out the next day since we had to wait for our room to be ready, but they were not able to accommodate a complementary late check out.   The rooms also don't come with a coffee maker and the fridge is full of minibar offerings so you can't really use it to put any leftover food.   Even with the inconveniences, we would probably give this place another try."}
{"text":"Gamblers Beware -  Several months ago the casino switched its video poker games to a new software platform.  Progressives now will not pay until jackpots reach sometimes highs of over 40% gains for the house. Chairman Level players report that they have stopped winning anything over the past several months. Bartenders also report that their tips are down because no one seems to be winning much. Coincidence?"}
{"text":"Seems to be going downhill. Staff not cheerful or helpful. Have stayed here before, but will go elsewhere. South Point is cleaner and better value for example."}
{"text":"Let's \"name drop\" for a moment -   Bill Clinton, former president of the UNITED STATES. Vince Neil, former lead singer of MOTLEY CRUE. These guys have been at the hotel while I was there - need I say more?   It should tell you that this place is for everyone, whether world leader or rock legend (or even me).  My highlight list:  - Small, comfortable casino - Irish pub - Nice rooms - Great pool area - Classy joint - Reasonably priced  This is a really nice example of one of the Station casino properties located some 10 minutes from McCarren airport & the Las Vegas strip.  This & other Station properties are very generous with offering discounted or free room accommodations if they know who you are, so remember to always use your Players Card."}
{"text":"Is it so wrong to give Green Valley Ranch extra stars because I got to stay here for free?  Probably not.    The bedrooms and bathrooms are spacious, and the room I stayed in had a flat panel tv, which is probably standard at all hotels on the Strip.  Green Valley is a nice alternative if you're trying to stay away from the hustle and bustle of Sin City.  Yes, I went here with a boy, many, many, many moons ago.  And, Ma, if you're reading this, we slept in separate beds."}
{"text":"GVR is like what Target is to Walmart.  Both sell the basics but Target makes the experience that much more comfortable.  GVR has amenities fundamental to a good experience.   Our family have been regulars at GVR for over 7 years.  It's still one of my favorite off strip hotels.  The M Resort on St Rose parkway has been getting our business lately but we still manage to make it out to Henderson every so often.  The rooms are holding up well and look properly maintained.  They are as nice as our first stay all those years ago.  I think the room TV's are the same standard def. non-HD ones so that's one upgrade I would suggest to the management.  Also the wifi is 1.5 mbps slow.  They call it complimentary but technically you are paying for it via the resort fee.   The place is freeway close so in 15 minutes you're on the strip to try your luck elsewhere if your bank roll gets blown out at the casino down here (a seemingly consistent pattern for me).  There's a Fat Burger in the casino food area and a cineplex movie theater on property.  The pool area is good for lounging and kids.  The East Tower is my preferred side."}
{"text":"the nicest casino ever! I like the mélange of foods, cafè and a great buffet  very clean and you feel comfortable with the ambiance"}
{"text":"Wow. Getting upgraded to a suite unexpectedly doesn't happen often enough - for any of us. So when the hotel gods give you a blessing, enjoy it!  Green Valley is far away from The Strip. It's peaceful, quiet desert luxury. The vibe skews a bit older than, say The Cosmo or SLS. Honestly, that's not a bad thing if you're over it when it comes to flashy vibes or making it a night out at the club. What's wrong with getting a massage or relaxing at the pool?   Unfortunately I didn't get to do any of those things because by the time our flight landed, we got our rental car, had dinner on The Strip, then drove to Henderson, it was 11:30 pm. However, late check in was rewarded with a complimentary upgrade since they were out of regular rooms. And since I only paid $70 for the room in the first place, the suite was especially sweet.  Living room, executive dining room, balconies with Mountain views, two bathrooms, and two TV's - bigger and nicer than most apartments I've rented over the years. It's too bad we weren't living it up that night. Went straight to bed!  Next day the sunrise was beautiful - a more natural, peaceful way to appreciate the valley. A long, hot shower and some Vegas local TV helps a person wake up. Plus, there's the Grand Lux downstairs for pancakes!  I'd stay here again, for work or pleasure. Assuming I had a car to get to Vegas proper. Or if you're keeping it Henderson, uber could be your transport. Not wild but very nice."}
{"text":"we stayed there for the fourth of July and we had a great time... the pond was great a really nice place to chill and hang out loved the seating arrangements although i would recommend going early because the seats get full quickly...the pond is 21 and over and you can take off your top so be ware of TITTIES and we seen a couple of pairs each day.. the rooms were very nice clean although the housekeepers were stalkers they kept knocking at our door for random things like water.. robes etc..  the whiskey river is a nice place but it never seemed to get crowded.. and the casino was nice.. I would defiantly go back."}
{"text":"Went here with all my coworkers for a company offsite.  The property is beautiful and it's also right next to this outdoor mall (convenient!)  Loved it!"}
{"text":"If I could,I would give zero stars. Here's why: Upon arrival the systems were down and I was not able to check in until 7pm. I arrived at 1 an expected to be in my room around 3, not 7pm. At the lobby bar I ordered a Moscow mule and it came in a copper cup. 30 minutes after I got my drink I was enjoying it outside until the bartender interrupts my conversation with some friends to tell me, \"if you steal this mug you will be charged 30 bucks.\" My instant reaction was why would I want to steal this mug, I'm not into selling copper on the black market. So rude! Then a friend who was staying there too had a gas leak in her room, she had to change rooms at 2am! Last but not least, they deactivated my key 24 hours before my check out time. Don't waste your money or time here!"}
{"text":"We come and play craps here from time to time with friends. I gave this Casino the benefit of the doubt a few times. I though maybe the dealers on these craps tables were just having a bad day. Turns out, after several attempts to have fun at this Casino, the craps dealers are by far the rudest, most arrogant, unhappy people in Las Vegas. This is coming from someone who has actually won money the last few times I've been there so rest assured, I am not sour due to losing. Every time I've been here to play craps it's a terrible experience. I won't be returning after seeing bad attitudes and piss pour customer service from these dealers so many times. People want to have fun. These dealers will make sure to turn any great night sour. What is management thinking? They get two stars because the Casino itself is amazing. Beautiful, clean, and ventilated."}
{"text":"Green Valley Ranch was a wonderful romantic getaway for my husband's birthday. It's about 8 miles from the strip in Henderson, NV.  It's in an upscale residential area with the hotel on one end and the casino and shops/restaurants at the other end. Unfortunately didn't visit the pool area but our room was so beautiful! High ceilings and modern furniture. Beautiful bathroom, deep soaking tub and a nice stand up shower next to it. Everyone was nice and helpful, I liked that our room was close to the check in area.  Alot of shops close by even restaurants like Cheesecake Factory, Elephant Bar,Whole Foods Market (which we love to buy organic foods).   Things I would complain about would be that our king size bed could be a bit more comfortable. It was a little stiff. Our pillows were very soft but I think too soft as I tried getting my head comfortable on it. We stayed on the 5th floor of the west tower and you can hear the wind hitting the building every now and again, took me a little while to fall asleep. Lastly, our room was a little warmer than I wanted it to be even with the A/C turned to 60 degrees the entire time. We turned on our TV around midnight, we could see the picture but only static came out of the speakers. We called downstairs and they took care of the problem over the phone. Prompt Service. There's a little snack bar with candy, water, nuts, alcohol, etc. in a cabinet below the tv but don't pick anything up unless you plan on buying it. Each item is on a weighted table that let's the hotel know when you moved something. You take it out to just look at it and you will be charged lol - it was funny hearing the front desk explain it to me, you've been warned! Also if you pay with a debit card, they \"freeze\" $100 per night on your card for incidentals. When you check out they then unfreeze that amount  on your debit card.  Not sure if it takes a day or two for the money to be available for you to use again. We only stayed overnight so it wasn't a big deal but I can see it being a big deal if you're staying a couple of days or longer.  All that being said, I really enjoyed my stay and definitely would stay here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the buffet! Probably the best seafood buffet in Las Vegas area. It's a great place to get together and the whole family loves it! Recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I have no real complaints about Green Valley other than how long it always takes to get from/to my room. There is a starbucks onsite and as long as you have your ID, you can charge your order to your room. The service is always good and the rooms are a good size."}
{"text":"Visiting the spa was an amazing experience! Marla was sweet, comforting, and gave me a wonderful facial! We absolutely cannot wait to go back! Definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"I want to let everyone know what a horrible place this hotel is.  They have the worst customer service I have EVER dealt with.  I was there for a dance competition and I had a plate of some other table half eaten food dropped on my outfit.  I tried to wash it out myself but the stains would not come out.  After waiting 20 mins for Food Manager to come out the staff told me to go down to the VIP service. I then had the WORST MEETING WITH SHANA.  They put someone in VIP who has the worst attitude.  I told her the story and she said I don't know I suggest you go back downstairs to see what they could do. Never once did she apologize for how I was being treated or offered any solution to this problem.  I then said do you think maybe you could call downstairs and locate the manager.  She stared at me blankly then rolled her eyes as she dialed the number.  HAD NO CLUE WHAT TO DO AND GAVE ME ATTITUDE FOR HER STAFF DROPPING A PLATE OF HALF EATEN FOOD ON MY OUTFIT!!!!.  I then went to file a complaint on her and I received a COMPLETE JERK by the name of Gerghig (pretty sure that is the spelling), he made me tell him the whole story again and at the end said oh I can't help you but let me find someone who can.  I waited another 15 mins for someone to come out.  He came out and said that his manager was on the phone and I would have to wait.  I told him at this point I have been waiting to speak to someone for 45 mins and he said oh well you need to be patient.  WHAT??? I have been waiting for 45 mins so I asked him to go back and ask his manager to come out.  He rolled his eyes and went in the back never to come out.  Then a lady named Raylynn came out and said that she did not find anything that her staff did wrong and the best they could do is send out my clothes to be cleaned.  I told her with how unorganized the staff was and her attitude I did not feel confident in trusting them with my items!  She rolled her eyes and NEVER APOLOIGIZED.   On top of that we were staying with a group and they walked in on housekeeping going through there personal belongings! The hotel is old and dark and outdated.  I would not even considered this a resort but a motel style place to stay at best!  There are so many nice places to stay do not rob yourself of a great vacation by staying here!"}
{"text":"As every trip to Vegas I usually stay on the Strip but this time I decided (along w/ my friends) to stay off the strip in Henderson.  Why you ask?  Because Its cheaper...its quieter....and a lot less douche bags around. Ive been to GVR before to gamble but this was my first time staying. The hotel is great.  it is very clean. The staff is friendly.  The valet guys are cool and helpful. The pool area is cool.  It is a sand bottomed pool.  I do wish it was deeper.  They have a 21+ pool area also.  We decided to hang at the regular pool.  We had a cute server who brought us our drinks (overpriced! and she added her own tip!  Who does that?)  Near the pool they have the spa location where you can get your facials...masages..etc.  The casino area itself is cool.  Its not overly huge but it has everything that you need to gamble.  There is a small club in the casino that is low key.  Of course they have restaurants (Original Pancake House...which was good)..and a Buffet (which I didn't try!).  There is also an AMC Theater and a small video game area.  Overall..this is a great place to relax and have a good time.  Its only 10-15min away from the Strip if you want to head out that way.    Also..right next to the casino/resort is an outdoor mall that has stores (nothing really great) and restaurants (Lucilles BBQ...) if you feel like hanging there.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"-Today is Memorial Day, we love this place and during the summer season we come here to just lay out and then go home ( we are local of henderson by the way ) we always thought it is one of the greatest perk the casino gives for being a local and also it is a great way to give to the community. After all most of the locals support this place during its slow season, from gambling and eating in the restaurants and that is why they give us buy one get one buffets and discounts throughout the casino. ( we dont use it much we are over all the buffets in town )My husband just retired a couple of years ago and they do have military Monday's which gives you a few discounts and we are so grateful for it. But I'm a little disappointed today :( we decided to lay out today and we thought it would be the same like every year but surprisingly we were turned away and was told it is Memorial Day and they will not take us but rather we have to pay 25 dollars to get in if we wish. I guess that is understandable, and we were told that from now on if we would like to use the pool we are to pay now and things has change. I wish they have the same perks they have the pass few years for all locals. Still thankful tho' Green Valley Hotel and Casino  ."}
{"text":"Dinner buffet good ...nice casino great poker room ...but this is all i got to say about the breakfast buffet.while sitting on the toilet ...yuck"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this resort and for a couple of different reasons.  It's very welcoming and what I would consider a nice locals casino.  I have never stayed here so I cannot comment on the rooms, but I have heard very good reviews and some not so good reviews.  As far as gaming goes, the great thing about this casino is that they have the latest and greatest of machines and slots, with keeping a lot of the old favorites that people like.  Wizard of Oz, and some older slot machines.  I have yet to hit a jackpot here and sometimes the machines play rather tight.  Lots of different places to choose to eat.  The food court has the typical stations food places which rock.  Capriottis, fat burger, etc.  but there is also a great Pub, a steakhouse and a center bar that is a lot of fun on the weekend.  Parking in the back lot is also rather easy and convenient.  One of the big issues is the cocktail waitresses.  In my opinion, trying to get a drink here has always been an issue and I am not sure why.  I know this can be an issue at a lot of places but here is usually one of the toughest places.  This being said, I rather enjoy Green Valley Ranch, but I wouldn't say it's quite 4 stars.  One of the things I don't like"}
{"text":"Went for my birthday....we got a discounted rate ( but it's more then we usually pay). We got to our room....first all the curtains were closed...very very dark when you walk in...the room was nice, but then we had a balcony ( with a view...she said). There was nooooooo view....other then a view of a roof and a big wall. I wasn't happy with it and called down to the front desk and asked to be moved. They upgraded us to a bigger room that overlooked the pool for $ 10 more a night. The room was HUGE and a beautiful view. The hotel is just beautiful. I just love the fact that you don't have all the party type people from the Strip mentality here. It's really not that far from the Strip...if you go, but there is tons to do right near there. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"do not stay here do not even eat in a restaurant or choose to gamble.  I was charged 90 dollars for a room that was comped and free for using 50,000 hard earned points.  I was told I forfeited my deposit because I was unable to stay in the room even though I cancelled the room reservation three days before because I was in a local las vegas hospital.  how can they charge you 90 dollars for a room that was paid for with very hard earned comp points.   they are proof that vegas today is mo different than it was in the days of it being ran by the mafia.  this is no less than a criminal act on their part and they are lining their pockets with the blood money of innocent people.  for you own safety and to not put your self at risk you must avoid all station casinos."}
{"text":"Pretty, classy hotel. Nice dining options. Lovely pool with an adults area. The view from the room was of the parking garage though."}
{"text":"The casino by my house. Reasons why I love it:   1. Gaming is great, tons of machines, nice poker room, etc. Limits are a tad high, hence why not 5 stars.  2. Sports book! They make lines that places on the strip won't even make. Huge, tons of comfy seating, awesome contests, etc.  3. Food.. food court with healthy options (tropical smoothie), and an Original Pancake house! The line is never that long at Original Pancake house and this place is top knotch.. never smokey!  4. Shopping (at the District) and a nice movie theater. You can truly spend an evening at GVR doing no gambling and still have a blast.  5. Bars.. Irish bar, cover band bar, Drop bar, tons of options for hanging out.  I love this place because it's nice and has the ambience of a strip casino without the attitude and ridiculous prices. There are many cheap dining options and the staff is great. They also have much better promotions and whatnot for low rollers."}
{"text":"Ok.....heres the deal.  If you love Vegas but tire easily after a few hours on the strip, this is the place for you.  The rooms are nice, quiet, and fully equipped with all you need.  The hotel is very clean & the staff is overly accommodating.  You will find several bars & restaurants on site.  Hanks is amazing if you love steak.  Theres also an Irish pub (cant remember the name) that has one of the best import beer selections I have ever seen.  There arent too many places where you can walk up to the bar & order a Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout.....  Also, we actually walked away with over $1,500 in winnings.  Give this place a try if you are looking for the Vegas Lite."}
{"text":"Stayed for one night. Friendly quick check in. Room was very nice ,clean with super comfy beds.Grounds are very well kept. Will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"We rent a cabana almost every year for my Father in Laws birthday and we had a blast! There was a storm that came through the night before and our TV wasn't working! They were going to switch us to a new cabana, but all of the empty ones they had - none of the TVS were working! (The birthday boy loves to layout on the couch and watch Tv, so that was big for us.)   Whitney was our cabana server this year (for half our out stay) and she was FANTASTIC! If you get a cabana here make sure you request her...for her whole shift! LOL. We had to give her up for the second half and we're not impressed.   This is a total locals spot and it was a very relaxing day.  We had people come and go all day ordered a ton of food, and drinks.   The only advice I have is to keep an eye on your bill. We were quoted $200 for our cabana - and quoted $150 for a second one, but we're charged $300. And also other people in our party paid for their orders of drinks and food before they left, but it was not taken off of our final bill at the end of everything. We had to argue with the manager for them to take these \"charges\" off our bill - as they have already been paid for! Thank goodness we we kept the receipts of everyone that left or we would've had to re-pay for everything else! We had about 4 different servers and I think that's where all the mix-ups began!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful way for a local to relax! Its my boyfriends birthday and since all the boys are down having fun on the casino floor while I recover from dinner. My overall experience so far has been great! We chose to come here because its 1) off the strip 2) clean 3) has a nice beach style pool and 4) the staff is usually friendly. We arrived few hours early and the front desk receptionist was more than willing to check us in early and with the $20 tip trick, she upgraded us to a petite suite! My suite has a huge balcony, king bed, comfortable chairs, tv, and a huge bathroom. Because its a weekday, the pool was slow and nice. We hate being bombarded with screaming kids and loud teens. It seems like they changed the outside slingbacks and added new day beds. Overall the pool was exceptionally clean and an A in my book! We love to come to this hotel whenever we want a short, relaxing day away from home. I just walked past the Whiskey Bar, the interior was pretty cool and about to head down there after I write this review. Give this place a try with your friends or family. The buffet prices are phenomenal, 30% off all spa services for locals too, and the rooms are super clean!!!"}
{"text":"We end up here once every visit to the folks. We just use the hotel for their buffet but it is good. Not the best in the state but definitely worth repeat visits. Being off the strip it is cheaper than some hotels but still boosts a huge selection of goodies to choose from.  If you are looking for Vegas style fun, this is really not the place to be but you can come here for a more subdued experience of the Vegas life. There is a lot of room to play on the different machines and the place is clean and big. Just as fancy as on the strip but without the price tags to match."}
{"text":"C'mon guys. You dropped Paigow Progressive Jackpot to $29k from $100k+, seriously? Now, I have to go to my old casino. You know there are plenty of other casinos, right?  Wonder who's lousy idea was it. Boycott!!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice spot to relax when visiting Las Vegas. Get away from the strip. Huge hotel has comfortable rooms and impressive suites. Sprawling Casino offers everything: great restaurants and bar, all the best gaming options. 24hr Fatburger, Waffle House in the morning. It has its own multi-screen movie theater and arcade. The spa is world class. Nearby are rows of small boutiques and food options. I'm a big fan of King Fish."}
{"text":"*Review is for the Buffet and the Gaming experience only*  Came for the Feast buffet since I was able to get it free through MyVegas. Walked to the Player's Card area and the line was definitely fast. After receiving the printout, walked over to the buffet and the lines came to a halt when their system went off-line.  Green Valley could basically take anyone with cash or CC but when looking up their points, they couldn't. What made it worse was a supervisor who came out and said, if you don't make it inside before 10:45am, it's lunch prices.   We did make it for breakfast after 40 minutes but I couldn't say it was worth it. (Yes, I did have to still pay for 2 other people). This was the smallest of the Feast Buffet it looks like even though look all the same. Choices seem limited and not sure if it was when I arrived it was in between transition for lunch but there weren't too many choices.   As for the gaming, I find it difficult to find people on the floor and so were the drink hostess. Can't say my first experience here was great.  The best thing here was a non-smoking slot section."}
{"text":"Outstanding resort in Henderson, NV. You can see the strip skyline in the distance. Immaculate grounds, friendly service, and beautiful resort. Lots of food choices. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"This place gives you more bang for the buck than just about anyplace else in the area. When you see just how beautiful it all is, you wonder how you got in for so cheap. There are far fancier places on and off the Strip. If you are a big gambler you can get a suite there for free. But if you are a $50 a day fun gambler then you will be a paying customer and this is where you should stay.   Period. Just pay the insanely low rates you'll find on Hotwire or Expedia and prepare to be amazed at the value for money. Next time you'll pop for a suite. They are also insanely great and good value for money. We will not stay anywhere else."}
{"text":"Waited an HOUR for security to NOT SHOW UP to unlock my safe. My family went off to dinner. Order and ate. Still no one showed up! And, the manager, Jared, was so unhelpful in solving the issue or trying to make things better. Don't expect good customer service here!"}
{"text":"I had lots of energy and was fully awake driving from the opposite side of town to Henderson but after talking all day and night with a friend then followed up by a not-so-good dinner sucked the life out of me and plus, I hate driving. My aunt who lives behind GVR, moved elsewhere so, I had nowhere to crash and I ended up staying here for the night.  The Pool: They have a very nice pool area and it's not super crowded like the pools on The Strip infested with diseases. Lots of areas to sit and chill out. Very clean and I didn't see drink cups/ glasses/ bottles, etc. It is relaxing. 5/5  Room: The room I stayed in had 2 queen beds, flat screen TV, mini bar, ironing board, bathrobe, and a desk area. It was by the pool area but it was quiet. The toiletries include: lotion, shampoo, conditioner, almond bar soap, hand soap, and body wash. Nice marble floor,beautifully tiled shower separate from the tub. 4/5  Restaurants and Bars: Tides, Drop, etc. You may want to go across the street (The District) if you want to eat something good. 2/5  Entertainment: They have a casino and movie theatre. 3/5  It's pretty reasonable to stay here maybe for a staycation which I've never done and probably would never do since I'd rather travel. The District is just across the street for food and shopping. They have a spa and a fitness center - make sure you check their hours."}
{"text":"Booked a last minute staycation and it just what we needed. Room was great for the price, food was good, great atmosphere all around, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Here for a real estate seminar. Paid for the room in full way in advance and even called today to let the hotel know we will be checking in late and reminded them that we need a non smoking, king sized bed. When we arrived at 11, we were still told that only smoking rooms were available. I am feeling nauseated and eyes are burning. It is completely gross. I'm going to smell like a chain smoker tomorrow. The so called free wifi  works intermittently, so we had to purchase an upgrade. It says $10 for the upgrade on the brochure, but when you actually purchase it, they charge you $17.99 PER device. The staff gives you convoluted directions to get to your room to make sure you walk through the casino. Many of my peers at the seminar were complaining about the same."}
{"text":"My husband and I come to Vegas once a week on business, we've been to Green Valley Ranch almost every weekend as my husband's family lives very  close. They told us the machines are tight, don't waste your money. They weren't kidding! The food experiences are as bad.  Cafe food was served cold, the server never came back to check.  Food court I explained I'm allergic to mayonnaise- my sandwich was drenched in it, the sandwich maker actually rolled his eyes. I almost walked away without the sandwich completely annoyed, should have but didn't.  The buffet experience (and very last time here)!  Terrible customer service- the cashier was impatient, the seater had flashed 3 fingers at us and marched off into the direction of our table, server brought 1 round of drinks and never saw her agsin - we asked another server for coffee at the end. The food was poor quality (this is what we do for a living)and very limited selection.  We aren't going to waste our time or money here again."}
{"text":"I think it's about time I write a review for GVR. I'm surprised I never have! I'm so glad this is our local casino! Super convenient location for us, off GV and 215. We've had family stay here in the past and the hotel is beautiful, but very expensive. The rooms are nice but not overly impressive. The pool is just my favorite place. I love the little sandy beach, the pool chairs are comfy and it's usually easy to get a spot. I wish they had local deals for the pool. If they did, I'd never leave!   The spa is out of this world luxurious. My GVR spa days are among my favorite days ever. The spa is modern, clean, the ambiance is super relaxing, and there's a co-ed area. The staff is friendly and helpful. I absolutely love the gym and how it's open to the separate spa pool and outdoor area. The new locks in the locker rooms are pretty finicky - I had to have mine reset multiple times on my last visit. Every second of my spa experiences at GVR have been nothing short of spectacular! 30% off on weekdays for locals.  They have Pizza Rock now, which is really growing on me. It gets busy on the weekends, so head there early for a table.   The buffet is, well, a buffet. Lines are usually slow, and wait times are ridiculous even when lines are seemingly short. I like that they do gelato milkshakes, but I should lay off milkshakes for a while, LOL. The mongolian grill is awesome.   I find myself here frequently so I'm glad it's as nice as it is!!!"}
{"text":"Best local buffet for the price food is always good. Nice place to relax specially the pool area."}
{"text":"NOT FOR NON-SMOKERS!!! Beautiful hotel with very clean rooms, and off the strip but C'mon Vegas you gotta get with the program and follow Atlantic City's lead and ban smoking in all of the casinos.  Okay, so there was a small non-smoking section for slots in the casino but you still can't avoid it. I would have given this resort a 5 star but I cannot believe that they still allow smoking in the casinos/pool area here.   In order to get access to any of the restaurants you have to walk through the smoke filled casino. Nice that there's a huge movie theater downstairs on the premises but again you're subjected to the cigarette stench.  Fortunately, we stayed in the East Tower building which is a completely separate building where the smoke won't travel.  We stayed on the 8th floor, the view was facing the parking lot but had a great sunrise view over the mountains and it seemed as though we had the entire floor to ourselves, it was great! Didn't see another soul the entire time except for the staff.  Staff are wonderful too, very accommodating, amenities are great, nice plush robe in the room but would've been nice to have 2 robes instead of 1 (hence 2 people in a room) but I didn't care, I don't use robes, robes are stupid anyway ;-)  The infinity pool is nice, has a little sand area like you're at a beach.  But the pool at the  spa is great for doing laps and it's never crowded. It's a hidden gem. And not any smokers there. ;)"}
{"text":"One of the really nice local Casino Resorts in the valley. My husband's boss decided to forgo his yearly July 4th houseparty and rented rooms and cabanas at Green Valley Ranch. We ate at their Mexican restaurant Borracha which was very good, especially the margarita. Relaxed, swimmming, and drank at the cabana. Watched the fireworks and did jello shots. Hung out later in the bosses suite making noise, eating snacks, and passing a bottle of Jameson around. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful, even security was nice about telling us to keep it down.  We came upon food spills in the hall and vomit in the elevator, the staff were on it and it was cleaned quickly. Everything was kept clean. We finally escaped to our room, it was very nice and modern with a view of the pool, upgraded toiletries, a mini bar to tempt you into draining your wallet. Comfy bed, we slept like babies or was it because of the booze.  Fought the hangover in the morning with a shower in their beautiful bathroom, Starbucks run was a must, and a couple Advil. We even got a complimentary newspaper at our door in the morning, that'll be read later in the bathroom perhaps. Good times. I would definitely stay their again and would recommend it as well."}
{"text":"Cons - smelly and dusty rooms - renovated rooms don't look and feel renovated  - overall atmosphere at casino is depressing  Rates were not much better than higher end properties in Las Vegas.  Do your research and get similar priced rooms and get way better rooms and happier casino atmosphere.    Will not return.  Check out other reviews.   Clearly management does not read their yelp reviews.  Denial maybe?"}
{"text":"Ok... so this might end up being a long review, so let me get to the main points before I explain my reasoning.  Customer service is the WORST my wife and I have ever experienced. Intentionally difficult and not accommodating. Lied to us, and screwed us out of money!  Ok, so I will start out with our story.  My wife and I purchased a groupon several months ago to celebrate our honey moon.  We got married the day before we ended up checking in...  but our problems with them started WAY before check in.  Before we bought the groupon, we had checked with them to make sure our dates for our honeymoon were available.   We were stoked b/c a 4 start resort on a discount!!! plus it will be a place we can always come back to, to celebrate.  So we bought the groupon and literally the moment we had it in our had, we went to book the room for 6 days...  turns out... they were mistaken, they didn't have the rooms available for us.  after SEVERAL weeks going back and forth, even getting laughed at (when they thought they put us on hold, one representative said to another representative  \"another one of the groupon people\" then laughed) we had not reached an agreement.  I went to Groupon to get a refund... I explained what happened, and they said the would see what they could do.  Groupon called back and were able to get me 4 out of the 6 days I purchased, and would refund me the rest... Groupon by the way has REMARKABLE customer service.  So anyway, my wife and I get married and we go to check in.  I tell the front desk guy (Jake), \"Hi, Brett V_______, checking in for our honeymoon\"... he says... \"name again\".  I respond \"Brett V____, checking in for our honeymoon\"  he responds \"ok\".  I present the the groupon and he asks if I've read the terms of the groupon and there card policy\" (they freeze $100 a day you are there).  I tell him yes.  He says, ok... then proceeds to check me and asks if we want an upgrade for certain prices.  I say, \"no, we are trying to keep on our honeymoon budget.\"  He continues to check us in... and we get the keys to our 1st floor, view of the parking garage, room.  Not to mention our room came with a bluetooth pick floss thing that was left on the floor, and left there by housekeeping our whole stay, and under the table was some guy's boarding pass from MARCH!!!  Look, I'm not expecting a free upgrade b/c it's our honeymoon... but we got a CRAP room... and can I at least get a freaking \"congratulations\" or \"thank you for choosing Green Valley for your honeymoon\"...  I didn't get squat... or even common courtesy.   Not sure if it's b/c Groupon people are treated as 2nd class citizens, or they had a note in my file b/c I had to have Groupon step in and hold Green Valley to their own contractually agreed upon word.  The wifey had a massage, which she said was nice, and her masseuse, was awesome... but the spa staff just didn't give 2 craps about her.  The Groupon says it comes with $25 a day resort credit, which we banked for her massage.  The spa pool is nice b/c its away from the kids and partying/loud music.  I ordered a drink at the spa pool and it took about 45 minutes to get it.  A couple of hours later I witnessed  2 ladies saying they were refusing to pay for their food b/c it had been over an hour and they didn't want it anymore.  When we finally checked out, they told me they wouldn't be applying the $25 a day credit to my massage bill (thus the expensive massage I had banked it for) b/c it was a \"pool credit\".  I told them it never specified it was a pool credit... they said it did... I double checked my groupon... nope... they are lying... does not say pool credit... it says resort credit.  the Spa is a part of the resort.  When I asked to see where the $25 a day credit went then... they told me \"it wasn't on the bill and to not worry about it\".  Sorry Green Valley, you are underhanded, slimy, and crooked in your dealings.  The only positive thing I can truly say about the place,  the staff at the \"Tides\" restaurant were over the top nice (my wife pointed it out and wondered if they knew the rest of the resort's customer service sucks so much, that Tides makes up for it) and they have a GREAT view for fireworks if you park on the 215 garage.  ok, that's it.  If you've made it thus far with my griping... I urge you not to go there... We wont be returning.  Brett & Linds"}
{"text":"I booked a room on Hotels.com and I have a feeling that either this hotel may not be crazy about that or just does not seem to understand convenience. I checked in for a king size bed and I was placed at the very end of the hall, a very long hall, on the second floor, with neon lights flashing through the windows at night and a terrible view. I thought... Usually rooms at the end of hall have nice views yet when I got there... Yeah... Nope... Pretty bad! I ended up just closing the curtains at night. The hotel has potential as it is very pretty and the grounds around the hotel are beautiful. The rooms are nice... In my opinion a little bit outdated compared to other hotels, especially the newer ones on the strip, yet at least the bed is comfortable. There is a minibar in your hotel room, although quite expensive. There is room service available. The size of the room is good with a very nice bathroom, and the walk to the casino is roughly 3 to 5 minutes.  Getting around this hotel to either the parking lot or another section takes little time to learn and can be confusing, yet there are signs for where to go, only they are plastered onto the wall and not obvious unless you really look for them as they are very high up close to the ceiling. If you are staying in this hotel, make sure to let check in know if you want to be close to the elevator or have a good view. I think it is important because although the inside of the room was OK for me, it was very far away from where elevator was, for going to the casino and the garage where I parked, and the view was pathetic."}
{"text":"Not crowded today. This place gets busy fast, but on early Sunday morning, we had no trouble finding a parking place, nor finding a line at the buffet.   We saw many new slots as well, most empty however, both before we ate and after. Business must be down.   If you are lucky, you could find the best slots here, they have always been pretty good to me."}
{"text":"Rooms are nice and beds are comfy.  However the layout of this hotel/casino is not the best.  Figuring out where to park and check in was confusing.  It's like a maze and just when we were about to get used to it, we had to leave.  Dined at Grand Cafe and Pizza Rock and they were both great.  Overall, beautiful hotel but layout could have been better."}
{"text":"I would give it a minus a hundred stars a man had a heart attack outside of the slot tournament area they would not give him any help his loved ones watched him die right there on the floor without helping him do not go there it is a horrible place they could care less about the human like I wrote the CEO Mr fertitta he would not even respond he could care less the man dies in on the floor in the casino which she is a CEO that is terrible not to answer to them all they want to just do it get his body out of there so they wouldn't have to fill out paperwork that he died on the floor they have no respect for human life they are the lowest life people on this earth"}
{"text":"This is for the Green Valley Ranch 'Feast' Buffet. Yelp has a bunch of entries that run together.  We went at about 4pm to learn that their $5 buffet had become a $13 buffet per person. I couldn't tell you what the difference was in food, as it seemed the same. Fortunately for them, the food selection and quality was excellent. They also offered a complementary glass of wine for each of us.  The only thing that was a letdown was the dessert. Overly sugary confectionary stuff without any true variety, I found. For $5 it would have definitely hit 4-star material. For $13, in Vegas, they just get a 3 from me."}
{"text":"Just came back from a little get away 9/4-9/6 and just love this place. We have stayed here several times and always enjoy the resort feel compared to the strip. The grounds are beautiful, rooms clean and comfortable and the staff is wonderful. The Spa and fitness center is really great and the lady who runs the Spa seems to always be on top of everything. Even the dealers in the casino are so nice when they take your money (haha) but seriously they are very friendly and helpful for a novice craps player trying to yield you the most money. Thank you or a nice visit and look forward to returning real soon."}
{"text":"Friend visiting and we were heading out with the hubby watching the child for some fun.  I love Green Valley Ranch which I thought would be a great place for my friend to come see and enjoy The District which is attached.  We were looking for electronic Roulette and they had it.  We played for over 3 hours - too much fun.  We had a smoothie at Tropical Smoothie which is located in their food court.  Also, the valet workers were very nice and the ease of getting my car and feeling safe around midnight was wonderful.  My friend who always stays at the strip says the next time they are in town they want to stay at Green Valley.  :)"}
{"text":"Bingo. Do not play bingo at Green Valley unless you don't want to talk and have a good time. The old people will shoosh you and complain to management. If you want to talk or have a good time go some place else. This is not the place for any one under 70."}
{"text":"I had a great time at this resort. I wasn't really looking for the whole \"vegas experience\" like I normally am... I just wanted to get away for a while and this proved to be the perfect place for just that. I didn't even have to leave the resort for the three days I was there. It is right across the street from a whole foods and the district is a little street of shopping and dining with just about everything you could need.  The rooms are fairly spacious. They have a bath tub as well as a glass stand up shower (which is almost necessary for me because I hate tub showers). I also had a balcony which was large and great. The only downside was I didn't have much of a view but the balcony was nice nonetheless.  There are about 7 restaurants and a food court to keep you satisfied. All thatI ate at were delicious. I also scored a bit in the high limit room on video poker so it's good to know that machines pay out every now and again.  The only downside I would say is when checking in they always seem to say those rooms are full but they do have a suite available. I am convinced they try to force you into upgrading or else you can't check in until after 4, because sometimes if you pester them enough, something magically opens up all of a sudden."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed there for two nights in June. We had a good time, until we checked out. We moved to a hotel on the strip and I immediately found that we had forgotten our iphone and ipad chargers and a pair of wedge sandals (brand new at $120). I called lost and found approximately an hour and a half after we checked out. The gal in lost and found/security was very nice but they could not locate my sandals even though I told them exactly where I left them nor our chargers? Long story short my sandals and chargers were stolen by either housekeeping or they didn't clean well and stolen by the next guest in our room. They sent us chargers, which weren't ours. General manager pushed me off to their insurance company who stated they weren't liable for the theft! We WILL NOT give them our business again, which is really ashame because it's a nice resort."}
{"text":"Came here on a business trip. The booking lady was rude and unaccommodating. If I didn't have to stay here I would have found another location.There are a lot of restaurant choices, but the service was awful so we left the resort for the district. The bed was like sleeping on a sheet of plywood. The pool closes at 4 on weekdays, which totally sucks because that's exactly where you want to go after a long day of meetings. I wouldn't recommend this location"}
{"text":"The reason why I give this casino 3 stars is because of the strong cigarette smell when you first walk in. My boyfriend and I were only here for an hour and when we left, we both stunk of cigarette. It was disgusting to us because we are both nonsmokers.  I like that they have the older slot machines that you don't see anymore at the newer casinos.    I don't have much luck here but I know people who only gamble here because they always win. I just wish I had their same luck."}
{"text":"I love this place for the pool.  Oh, and the rooms are pretty killer too.  But the pool is amazing. It offers a sandy beach, james bond-esque bar, and a view of the strip.  Check into this hotel and spend your days by the pool.   It's worth it.  It didn't get 5 stars because the waitresses are really bad.  So I suggest you get a cabana and get bottle service so you can be in charge of your own cocktails. Happy tanning!"}
{"text":"NIGHTMARE HOTEL is a better description of this pseudo resort UNTRAINED STAPH no not a misspell Valet ATT was an idiot I used a living social and they have still not credited my acct it's been over a month layout of hotel is piece mealed by a blind mouse I'd rather stay home"}
{"text":"Good solid casino/resort/etc.  I think of GVR as upscale for the local Las Vegas casinos.  Although I think their buffet is not any better than the Sunset Station, which they also own.  The parking lot is perfectly located.  Drops you right in the middle of the action and not a long haul that some other casinos make you do.  Last night when I was there, I thought their ventilation system was not working as good as it should.  I realize that people are allowed to smoke while gaming, but I shouldn't reek of it just by walking through.  I like the Regal movie theaters.  I hear good things about their pools, but I just haven't gotten around to them.  Next on my list!"}
{"text":"The hotel is nice but most of the people at the check-in desk aren't!!  We lost over 2 hours of our vacation waiting for our room to be ready after we checked in because we went to a rude person. Everyone else checking in got their rooms immediately. When we complained they would just make excuses.  The first night of our stay we were awaken at 8:00am from hammering, scrapping and heavy objects falling above our room. We had only gotten 3 hours of sleep!!  We waiting hoping the noise would stop but it never did.  We had to go down to check in, get in line (VERY tired) and complain about the noise. The check in guy acted like he didn't believe me and that upset me even more. Finally, we had to change rooms after we were exhausted. The manager gave us a $25 food credit but wasn't very nice about it.  If the people at check in were only a little bit nice and understanding our stay would have been great. They ruined our 3 nights at Green Valley!!!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to be able to offer a better review for this place, but we stayed the weekend and they continued to let us down over and over again.  The room they gave us had a view of the parking garage. There's no fan in the bathroom whatsoever so when we showered the room was very humid afterward.  We ate at the buffet. We are platinum members with their rewards program, but the line for platinum members moved slower than the regular line so we moved to that one to pay. After paying we moved back to the platinum line to be seated, but again the regular line moved faster and the people who were behind us in the regular line were seated before us, even though there was only one lady ahead of us in the platinum line.  The food at the buffet was a total let down, limited variety on everything but the desserts. The greens at the salad bar were wilted and the toppings were sparse. The wait at the carving station was long and the portion sizes were small. I total disappointment.  We went to the pool two separate days. The first day we couldn't get a waitress to come by at all so we finally left to go get drinks at the casino. The second day we got out there at 10am (the pool opens at 9), 2/3rds of the lounge chairs were reserved with towels by people who weren't even at the pool - they just came out to reserve seating. We finally found 2 chairs together and relaxed. They had made me throw out my coffee on our way in, they have a sign posted that says no outside food or drinks. But I started getting more and more upset as I saw person after person walk in with drinks or food in hand. I was pissed that I had to toss the remainder of my iced coffee but so many others were allowed to bring theirs in.  The slots were very tight. We like to play the games that have bonus features like free spins, but we wasted $20 after $20 in various machines and only found one that we could ever get to trigger a bonus.  The resort is nice looking. The pool is pretty and has a sand on one side (great for keeping most of the kids in one place). But the service was so poor and the room was a disappointment so I really don't see us staying here again."}
{"text":"The website states:  We truly luv locals. All you need is a Nevada drivers license and you can unlock a 20% discount. (False statement) Take a little off the top of your relaxing day, or use the savings to buy more treatments. (What savings?!)  Locals Special Discount - Valid for Select Services (**NOTE the word SELECT) 30% Discount Monday-Thursday 20% Discount Friday - Sunday    So -- Locals -- BEWARE!  If this resort truly loves locals -- why all the restrictions?  Bait-and-Switch?!  Hmmm...    I booked an 80 minutes deep tissue massage for myself and an 80 minutes blues-be-gone massage for my girlfriend on a weekday -- the therapists are good but in my humble opinion -- not $210 worth when you can get the same or even better massages for half the price.  I get it -- we get to use the whole facility -- the sauna, jacuzzi, etc. -- but the place is like a gym (not very spa-ish).  I typically bring my own hair brush but this time -- I forgot.  They do provide plastic brushes and combs -- and I was informed by one of the staff at Green Valley Ranch that they sanitize these overnight -- but really?!  How is it possible when there are strands of hair chillin' on not just one but all the brushes?  A staff happened to walk by when I was dying my hair and she just shrugged her shoulders -- didn't even apologize -- and responded, \"well, that's what I'm told.\"  It's not her fault... I own the fact that I forgot my brush at home.    When we checked out, I was informed by the cashier that there's an automatic 20% gratuity.  Was I upset?  No ... this is Vegas and as a local, I completely understand the importance of tipping.  HOWEVER -- I would highly recommend that they put THIS on the website -- right next to the We truly luv locals.... ;-)    We ended up tipping 22% -- in cash -- because if we charge it on our credit card -- the therapists will not get their tips until next payroll.  (Yes -- as a Vegas Local, I knew that)  Before we went on our merry way, the cashier said, \"You're more than welcome to come back to use the facility again since it's an all-day pass.\"  Umm... I think I'm going to PASS on this generous offer."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed here again last year. This time, there was a wine bar in the Italian restaurant area which was very neat. You prepay for a card (about $50/person) and try 1, 2 or 3 oz. of wines of various calibers.   It was fabulous for trying expensive wines without breaking the bank. In particular, we tried a wine that was several hundred dollars for the bottle but only paid $30 for a small pour to try it. Not bad for a taste of luxury! Highly recommended for value.   Service is self-serve, but there was someone from the staff that helped to explain how it's done though they were not very attentive to our needs when we first sat there waiting a while for service not realizing how it's done there."}
{"text":"This was a great family friendly resort. The beach style pool was great for the family. The package included breakfast at the buffet which exceeded my expectations. Would definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"Nice casino off off OFF the Strip. The only reason to stay here if you are coming to Las Vegas is with a convention group. Its like a nice casino resort shoved in a shopping mall from Columbus OH. Layout reminds me very much of Easton Center.   No one looking to come to Las Vegas from out of state should stay here. Its a $30 cab ride one way to get to the strip. They have a shuttle (with limited seating and schedules) that will take you there for free. But I know when I come to Vegas I want to experience Vegas. That being said its a nice place, The rooms are comfortable. And if you have to be marooned in Henderson it's not the worst place  OH! VERY IMPORTANT - Make sure you get a good cab driver. Do not get in the cab with the guy who arrived two weeks ago from Ethiopia and is now driving a cab. He will have no idea where to go and his iPhone (thanks Apple!) will take you completelu in the WRONG direction and then ask you for $75 when you finally redirect him to the right location. BE WARY!  This is not the vacationers Las Vegas. This is Henderson. It's built for corporate meetings and events. That's OK. Just know what you are getting into."}
{"text":"It's a great place to eat on special occasions the food is pricey but it's great quality and the staff is well trained.plus you can always place slots on the casino before you eat and win. Well maybe. Also the appetizers were excellent you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful! Rooms are roomy, clean, luxurious. staff are really on point and professional! But the one thing that puts a dark cloud over our whole experience is the pool closing at 7pm!!! It's still light and honestly that was the one main reasons we stayed here and not on the strip. Honestly don't know if week be back:-(  if you don't have kids then this place is in point for having all the amenities with out the traffic and congestions. If you have older kids you might want to try someplace with longer pool hours."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to GVR, and it won't be the last.  Why?  The people here are amazing, no matter where you are in what may well be the most peaceful resort in all of Nevada.   From the warm welcome I received from Diane T. at the front desk to the smiles and \"good mornings\" from the housekeeping team in the hallways (they do a wonderful job with the five-star rooms, by the way), the casino bartenders and especially Karen, my incredible server at the pool.   Oh, and two thumbs way way up to the airport shuttle driver, who's a lot of fun (and I wish I had written down her name).  She got a big kick out hearing about my Taco Tuesday adventure at the resort's new Mexican restaurant Barracho, which is an amazing and tasty deal!"}
{"text":"I loved GVR, even when they would treat me like a second tier citizen at the Pond pool cause I'm a male and not a female before 2008.  That all changed when the economy took a nose dive and they let anyone and everyone in.  However the new policy that no locals are allowed to Pond or the Pool unless you're staying at the casino put me over the top. I'm done with GVR, I will not stay there every again, nor will I spend a penny at the casino or anything associated with it.  I will make sure everyone knows.  STAY AWAY they do not love locals like their commercials lead you to believe."}
{"text":"I like GVR. It is a well kept and an enjoyable locals casino.  They have all the casino stuff, night club, food court, a few restaurants, swanky pool area.  LIKES: I go there mostly to hang in the sports book.  On Sundays I enjoy going there for 41 beers and dogs except they do not offer kraut on the dogs anymore... :(  Usually by about1:00 my friend is ripping up his 4 team parlays and cursing the Raiders.  The Irish Bar there is awesome when the band is playing.  They take requests and my bud yelled out \"play the Gambler\" (that is a King of the Hill reference).  We were just kiddin but they played it!  Good times here.  DISLIKES: The Chinese restaurant here needs to go.  It sucks.  They need more help in the sports book.  We usually have to clean a table when we get there."}
{"text":"This hotel is NOT a good choice for seniors! When my folks come to visit they usually stay at South Point. I wanted them to have an extra special experience when they came here at Christmas so I convinced them to stay at GVR instead. I personally love mostly everything about GVR so I was massively disappointed that the following was their GVR experience: Upon arrival on 12/23, only 2 registration desk workers were on duty so it took them 45 minutes to check in. Unacceptable. They were told to go to the East Tower, room 81xx. Of course, they went to the East Tower and searched for the 8th floor like anyone would do...but there isn't one. My elderly parents wandered around the hotel dragging their bags looking for this 8th floor that doesn't exist. (I also encountered several other guests wandering aimlessly looking for their 81xx room during the weekend and I was kind enough to give them directions, since apparently the GVR staff wasn't.) It took asking 2 staff members before it was finally explained to my folks that their room was actually on the 1st floor of the East tower and the 8 in their room number essentially meant nothing, unlike any other hotel we've ever stayed in. Once inside the room, they tried to put their clothes in the drawers but the drawers were painted shut so they called maintenance to unstick them. Then, my mom went to shower and the shower handle came off in her hand. Maintenance came again but the repair was going to take an hour at 11:30pm and they just wanted to get some sleep. They eventually moved to a different room. My dad really looks forward to waking up to a view of the mountains in the morning but from the 1st floor of the east tower, all you could see was the parking garage, so disappointing! The bed and mattress were so high off the ground that my dad couldn't get into bed. He had to climb on a chair just to get up onto the mattress. Each bed had no less than 8 pillows, mostly decorative. Lovely to look at but where do you put them when it's time to actually use the bed? The room was so tiny it was hard to find a place to put the pillows where they wouldn't be tripped over if you had to get up to use the bathroom at night. They couldn't even enjoy having breakfast together in the morning because the table in their room only had one chair. This room was so ridiculously small they can't even fit 2 chairs at the table!! What a HORRIBLE Christmas hotel stay for my elderly parents when I wanted them to have the most magical, memorable hotel experience of their lives. This was a huge disappointment. The hotel and casino look like a palace but apparently looks are highly deceiving once you're behind the closed doors of the hotel rooms in the east tower! Not to mention, the worst Christmas Eve meal of our lives took place in the cafe. The country fried steak was as tough as rubber, disgusting and unchewable! The shrimp scampi was a joke; I've made it better at home and for less money!! Another huge disappointment. I will, however, gladly give an honorable mention to the best fish and chips we've ever had in Tides and a fabulous happy hour martini experience with live music at Hank's...those were the highlights of the stay.  My advise: if you're wealthy enough to afford a suite, go for it, but the basic level rooms in this hotel are not a good choice for older folks. And finally...SHAME ON GVR REGISTRATION DESK STAFF FOR NOT CLEARLY EXPLAINING TO ALL EAST TOWER GUESTS HOW TO FIND THE ROOMS!!"}
{"text":"Since we had such a great time on our last visit watching football when we had the opportunity to stay at the hotel on a Sunday it didn't take long to decide to do it. It was a little difficult to find the hotel entrance as it is completely separate from the casino but once we found it they had free valet parking which was awesome. We were way earlier than the check in time but luckily we were able to check in right away.  The lobby was totally beautiful and grand. Check in went very smoothly and the employee who checked us in was very friendly. We were in the east tower which was a bit of a walk from the hotel lobby but it was closer to the casino. I really liked that you had to use your room key to get into the area where the rooms are. We stayed in a king room and I was impressed at how big the room was. The furnishings were nice and everything was well appointed. The bed was super comfortable and the pillows were amazing.  We had dinner at the buffet which was very good. There were a lot of choices and the staff was very friendly.  We wanted to go to the pool or hot tub but we couldn't really figure out when it was open or even if there was a hot tub.  The only thing we were disappointed in were the bars we had so much fun in before. We had a terrible time getting service and all the empty tables had glasses or bottles on them. The staff spent most of the time standing at the end of the bar talking. If I was rating this on that experience alone it would be much lower. Overall we would stay here again with the hopes that those in the bar were having an off day. The comfy bed would make it totally worth it."}
{"text":"Stayed here for a 2 day local stay-cations and we have to say ut was pretty amazing. At the moment they are redoing the front lobby so if visting soon besure to park on in the parking garage on Village View Drive. The lobby is now to the left of the pool entrance or the right of the Cafe.  We had a very nice stay the room was very clean but the casino is pretty smokey which is to be expected. We didnt gamble much so I wont review that. This resort has a wide verity of food options. And the pool is amazing!! & very kid friendly!! The pool is full service and there is always a waitress quickly available to take your order.  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We found this place 10 years ago when it was on TV  The rooms are nice the casino is great and it's very very good for conventions!    Stay here!!"}
{"text":"resort was pretty, room was fine, food that we had at the pool was great - but other than that i was underwhelmed. particularly the main pool. service was terrible. ended up going to the bar for our drinks before finally just going to the adult only pool to get away from the chaos and lack of attention from the waitstaff. i get it, they have to hire cute girls that are willing to wear a bikini to work everyday and look amazing. but a tip - try finding some servers that do more than work on thier dance moves at the bar instead of even trying to do thier jobs."}
{"text":"I had such an incredible, relaxing weekend at the Green Valley Ranch.  The large, sprawling complex was beautiful. The room was spacious, with a great view of the Strip and of the gardens.  The complex contained several fantastic restaurants (loved the huevos rancheros at the Grand Cafe and the Swedish Pancakes at the Original Pancake House) and the staff was so nice and accommodating.  And the pool area...wow!  Big lounge \"beds\" are scattered all over the grounds and a sandy beach right there at the edge of the main pool.  Plus they have this secluded, walled-in area called The Pond.   It was such an oasis. A shallow wading pool with a waterfall, several lounge beds that were actually in the pool, a ring of beds around the pool...and misters everywhere.  The misters cool everything down and make it absolutely impossible to want to leave your poolside bed.  I could have lounged for hours!    On the downside, the Green Valley Ranch is a pretty good distance away from the Vegas Strip.  I overheard mutterings of $30 cab rides.  Luckily we were there to visit family friends who happily shuttled us around."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing.   Came here with a group of 35. Had a reservation so got to skip the HUGE line of people waiting. Dinner buffet opened at 4 PM but they really started serving around 4:10. I was pretty excited because our group had just gotten back from a hike at Red Rock Canyon so we were starving.   Here's what I expected: Fresh, piping-hot, steaming, delicious entrees considering we got there BEFORE dinner even started.   Here's what we got:   -Luke-warm entrees that seemed like they had just been microwaved -Sushi/seafood that looked like it had been laying out for 3 days -Floppy, soggy salads etc.  The most satisfactory dishes for me were the pulled pork and the soft serve frozen yogurt. I don't know how much it cost but I'd really suggest going somewhere else. I won't be here again."}
{"text":"GVR is GORGEOUS - clearly the king of the Station Casinos. I love coming here just to get design ideas.   Their rooms are WAY nicer than many on the Strip - and includes places like the Bellagio and the Venetian. They can be had for as low as $54 depending on the time of year  - it's a steal. (My aunt got that rate with a military discount.)   I used to come here ALL the time with my friend Jerry J. after work to sit on the pool beds and eat sandwiches by the pool. The pool is awesome because it has sand in it. Snazzy.   The buffet isn't my favorite, but it's better than Sunset Station's buffet. I'm pretty sure the first dollar I ever gambled (only to put some points on my card for the buffet) was at this casino where I walked a way with a couple bucks in winnings.   The cool thing is this place has $5 movies at their theater!  I loooove this place."}
{"text":"Great Hotel, we stayed there last year and had an amazing time. Friendly staff, nice and clean rooms, super pool area. Its about 20 min off the strip but worse it."}
{"text":"It was a fine Wednesday afternoon where I decided to take a half day from work to take my best friends daughter to the pool at green valley. Which is one of my favorite locals casino. I usually have no problem going to the pool but today on July 26, 2017 we ran into a hiccup. A hiccup by the name of Jesus, and let me tell you he was no holy man. He asked if we were locals as I grabbed a towel I said of course. Then he said it would cost $25 a person for entrance. I have a friend that works at the spa there and I gave him a call and he said they normally don't charge to get in and he didn't see why there was a problem. Now $25 can get me into a day club on the strip. This is not the reason I came here. I came here to relax and enjoy my half day off. My friend works at the spa who will remain unnamed told me that it's normally free to get in for locals. This guy was trying to hustle for cash in a shady way that Vegas is notorious for . People like him really reflect the establishment they work for."}
{"text":"Am in LOVE!!!! First time staying here for a Mother's Day escape & so far it's been heavenly! I will say that my pool view room did have a loud party last night til late that was annoying. But the room service is amazing & the pool & cabanas are amazing!!!! Perfect & better than I expected!!! I'm on the top west tower floor so no smoke here too. My 800 sq foot room is so relaxing & beautiful too."}
{"text":"Had to take a star due to the Cons.  PROS:  The rooms are big and somewhat comfortable.  I felt that the pillows were too soft.  The casino was a good size.  I would compare this hotel/resort to the Venetian.  Casino was not overly packed and seemed to draw a lot of locals.  I think this was probably the only place that my family and I actually won.  The food court was nice.  In the morning, there was no waiting in lines at the Coffee Bean and after midnight, Fatburger, served up fresh burgers again without a crowd.  The pool was really nice and seemed really clean.  They have a 21 and over pool that is somewhat private, has its own bar and about 20 lounge pool chairs, about 10 cabana's and probably 4 to 6 pool beds.  The main pool has a sand entry beach and nice view of the strip.    CONS:  The DOWNSIDE of this hotel/resort is the carpets although looking clean are really dirty!!  Stay as far away from China Spice Restaurant as possible!!! The first night we tried this place because we were offered \"$25\" off when you spend $50 but only applies to food not drinks with alcohol.  The wait was 20 minutes with about 5 tables open and only 1 whole server working.  If you want to eat within an hour I highly recommend staying as far away from this restaurant as possible.  After being seated it took 20 minutes to place an order not because they were busy but because the waitress had the flap her gums syndrome (aka talked and socialized way too much).  Then it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks that literately sat on the side bar for 10 minutes and were served at room temperature.  After placing our order it took another 20 minutes to get COLD food!! Not even warm, like it was placed straight on a plate from the refrigerator!! When my mother told the waitress that the food was cold, the waitress turned to me and asked if she was telling the truth.  Shame way to start our trip and shame that this restaurant is even open to serve the public with all the unprofessional and rude service it provides.  I guess the up side was the our drinks got comp."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience during a conference! Every event had Jenn helping to keep things happy and running smoothly. Love her!!!!"}
{"text":"I have never felt as conflicted in writing a review as I do for this one.  I want to rate high because the resort is gorgeous and well-kept and we truly enjoyed our stay there. But there were some issues that I can't let go and need to be factored in. Those are not things you want to have to deal with when you're on a mini break (or coming home from mini-break).  Some things I did not appreciate: *Sarcastic tones when calling in reservations....\"You know you COULD have reserved your rooms online\" (I'm sorry I'm making you do your job) *I told them I knew I can reserve online, but I have to reserve a crib with my room...\"You still could have reserved online and then called concierge for the crib\" (WTH? are you not happy that you have a job?) *The attitude they gave me when they messed up the room reservations. They ended up upgrading my mom's room but the attitude we had to deal with was uncalled for. The only thing that was needed was an apology.  Anyone in our party would have been happy with a standard room.  But please, I work with the public and I know an apology goes a long way. Nix the attitude sweetheart. *Coming home and finding an extra $500 charge from the hotel on our charge card.  The accounting office had no idea what that charge was but they immediately refunded the amount and apologized profusely.  At least there is some professionalism in the front desk somewhere.    The things I loved about this resort: Comfy rooms and beautiful public spaces.  Dark wood, marble, leather--well decorated, warm and inviting.   A great place to stay if you want to stay off the Strip.  Only a quick drive if you want to get to the Strip and they offer shuttles as well.  Housekeeping, Valet, Concierge, Pool Staff--so friendly, professional and helpful. The pool area is gorgeous and also clean and well-kept.  It's a \"sand\" walk in, but it's pebbly sand, not soft Caribbean sand.  Separate pool/lounge area for 21+over crowd. Lots of options for dining--buffet, cafe's, restaurants, food court. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday present from my husband. I have never been to a day spa like this and it was very nice. After they checked me in you walk downstairs and get a pair of sandals and then they show you to your locker. There are spas in the female and male locker rooms as well as in the main co-ed area. I had three services and was helped by Michelle, Randy and Kristen. I had the Nirvana Stress Relief Massage (80 minutes), Papaya Pineapple (50 minutes) and Green Valley Ranch Signature Massage (80 minutes). I enjoyed everything and everyone was very nice. The papaya scrub was different and once you were scrubbed you rinsed off and then had a light massage. My skin feels great. While you are waiting you can have drink: water, juice or tea or a snack: granola, apples or pretzel's. They said you could also order food but I didn't do that. You are also able to use the amenities the remainder of the day. Only two things stuck out, for each appointment they didn't come and get me for a few minutes after my appointment time and I wish the robe would have been a little larger. Note- the spa has its own parking lot so you don't have to park in the main parking structure."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely beautiful. I loved the rooms and pool area was amazing, very clean, and super fancy. But I'm really big on service. And their service was horrible which is why I'm giving them 1 star. Such a beautiful place with such horrible service. The valet guy's never greeted us, gave us attitude and looked bothered to help. The cleaning staff complained about cleaning our room. The lady at the casino looked bothered we asked questions, about their rewards program, and gave us attitude; talked to us as if we were asking a stupid question. The bartender at the pool didn't bother asking if we needed help, when we arrived. Overall, I felt discriminated. I'm Mexican and this resort was mostly Caucasian families. I felt like they didn't respect me at all. So, if your Caucasian, and looking for a family oriented place, this is for you. Although, it was a beautiful place, I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Love this place, have eaten at a few of the restaurants, The buffet is better than most I like the sportsbook and casino it doesn't have the smoke smell that some do!! I can't wait to stay there... if your looking for a good buffet with better prices FEAST at Green Valley is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"For the committed gambler this sure looked like it had plenty of options.  Sizable casino floor with plenty of options.  Air circulation was good unless a guy from Dallas with a cigar sits next to you.  Was pretty busy and had more of a downtown Strip feel to it Saturday night."}
{"text":"Great staff, awesome room, great pool & spa.... great coffee / snack bar and cute clean casino. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So yeah. This place only gets five stars because there isn't a place for 6 stars. No it is not on the strip, and that is a bonus. You sit out on the pool and enjoy the serene view in serenity. I thought Shangri-la was suppose to be fictional, but they achieved it here.   I don't usually associate romance with Vegas, but this place was a dream personified. The bed was amazingly comfortable and big. The balcony looked out over a sleepy residential neighborhood filled with palm trees. The tub was massive, and there was a glass shower with a steam option.   Black Jack and poker tables downstairs, there was even a poker tournament. Lots of tasty food options right on the premises. Vegas baby!"}
{"text":"This is a cool casino , especially for locals.  I usually go to the movie theater here. They have a really cute food court, Coffee Bean, frozen yogurt, pizza, etc.  The casino opens up to The District, I think that attracts more people.  Its very local friendly but still keeps a good semi upscale look.  I know for sure they have a beautiful pool. I love the little cabana beads they have outside, they are really unique looking. I have laid on they outside when I was a guest at one of the night clubs."}
{"text":"We come to GVR because we live nearby.   I've actually always lived in this area and have been frequenting this property for almost 10 years.  I've seen a lot of change over the years but Station casinos are going through an upswing and you can certainly tell it here.   There are quite a few good restaurants to choose from (I personally love Pizza Rock and Bottiglia) most of them being pretty good.   The slot machines and promotions held by the casino (all of stations actually) are pretty good and even if you're like me and haven't really played in a while you still get access to many promotions.  The casino itself and pretty and clean and doesn't smell overly terrible like some other places.   Definitely a good place for a date night or even to hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"Went here to spend some time at the pool. The pool was pretty busy this day. Waitress service was definitely lacking and few and far between. Most of my group just went up to the bar for orders. Drinks lacked alcohol, I had two vodka lemonades and didn't even have a slight buzz.   We had excellent service in the center bar later that night. Bartender was fast and friendly with our group of 9. Fireball shots were plenty healthy, usually requiring a couple swallows.   The rooms were pretty decent and comfortable. No issues here its a good place to stay. Just not much wow factor anywhere, and the layout for check in is still a bit goofy."}
{"text":"This is amazing....35 people booked 9 month ahead....1/2 of them are teenage girls doing a soccer tournament.  The hotel oversold the rooms and is moving us to MGM 48 hours before our arrival.  All our planning with restaurants around hotel, transportations to fields near by is now thrown in the air.    I do 200K miles per year & have never experience something this bad in terms of customer satisfaction.  Many parents have concerns about having their teenage daughters on the strip & we are now far away from soccer field.  Again we planned & booked the rooms 9 month ahead....UNBELIEVABLE"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stayed here a few weeks ago and I was completely impressed!  My boyfriend talked me into staying off the strip...I was worried..  No worries anymore!  I cannot wait to return!  Pool is gorgeous and we felt like we had the place to ourselves in the middle of March!  Fun and beautiful and great escape off the strip...Vegas' hidden treasure.  My only recommendation - I wish the free shuttle to the strip had later evening drop off and pick up times."}
{"text":"My favorite casino and place to eat! I've had the buffet several times and it's always amazing probably the best I've been too. Out of all the other casino buffets I've been too, I definitely recommend coming here. The other restaurants they have in the casino are also really good if you don't feel like having the buffet! Love playing slots here also, always win something! I haven't gotten to the spa yet but I can't wait until I do I've heard nothing but good things about it so far so that's something I'm looking forward too. Hands down the best place to go!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places at the resort. Very clean and they provide complimentary water and towels for the gym. All the equipment works great, and they have enough of everything to make sure you get a great workout. The treadmills each have their own TV and they provide you complimentary headphones (new in a bag). The view from the gym is of the pool, so you can have motivation to work out harder. There was only one other person in there everytime I went in. Perfect."}
{"text":"This place is for \"locals\" and it's ridiculous.  The machines really never win if you talk to people who live here and they charge too much for drinks.  If you want to have FUN then go to South Point Casino on Friday nights where drinks are $2 for well drinks and the people there are nice unlike the staff at GVR.  It is just a pretty casino out to get money from you to be prettier period.  OH and NEVER use their pay phone there (I had to because I didn't have my phone with me and the desk wouldn't let me use theirs, lovely).  Anyway, used the pay phone and received a bill for $70.00 for 2 minutes because they go through some group that's a scam, fyi."}
{"text":"From the moment I entered the Casino floor I was greeted by a staff member with a big smile. That goes a long way with me. I then was helped with a question I had regarding the Sportsbook and the representative that helped me was very patient with me because I'm not very familiar with how sports betting works. After doing my thing at the Sportsbook I went to a restaurant in the casino called Pizza Rock. The food was tremendously tasty and the staff were very friendly and outgoing. My experience at Green Valley Ranch has been nothing short of spectacular. I will come back again for sure!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to stay.  Unfortunately, after you make your reservation, you are on your own.  The customer service if you need to make a change to your reservation is probably the worst in the industry.  Currently, I have been on hold for 13 minutes, after my 4th attempt to get, and pay for, an early check in for my elderly parents.  No one seems to be able to make a decision, and you will be transferred multiple times to no avail.  There just too much competition in this area for gaming and resorts to hassle with this hotel.  It is absolutely the WORST!"}
{"text":"I've stayed there many times. I love this place, not only is the atmosphere amazing but the employees are great, so friendly and willing to do whatever they can to make your stay even better. The room service and restaurants serve terrific meals, even in a timely manner. The valet attendants are incredible. They also offer a car washing service while having your vehicle with them. The pool is so relaxing after a long day of events. The pool attendants are so helpful, allowing you to sit out in the sun for hours with no problems. The rooms are fully equipped with the finest things, the most comfortable beds, amazing walk-in showers, and flat screen TVs to name a few. The suites include TVs in the main bathroom. Green Valley Ranch is perfect for all types of vacations, whether it is to just get away for a night or coming from out of town there is always something to do and comfort to be found."}
{"text":"This place used to be ok, not too smoky, lively and had good food.  I stopped by Saturday evening because my husband and I wanted to try our hands at Megabucks, but didn't want to deal with the crowds on the strip.  It was pretty dead and it was smokier than imagined.  The smoke level seemed to be almost on par with casinos back in the 80's and early 90's, it was pretty bad.  The non-smoking section offers a 1-2 second respite from the smoke and then you're back to wheezing and bloodshot eyes.  I don't know what happened to this place.  I'm thinking it all went downhill when the Pancake House left, but I don't come in here on a regular basis.  Maybe GVR just got hit really hard when the economy started tanking.  We didn't play any of the tables, but the slots and other gaming machines were not giving anything up.  Maybe a quarter or dollar here and there, but I didn't see or hear anyone winning while we were there."}
{"text":"It is possible to have a chill relaxing weekend in Vegas.   GVR was solid for off the strip lounging and free of the \"I just turned 21 so I'm about to get blasted out of my mind strip crowd!\"   First time at GVR was like 10 years ago at their Lobby Bar with all the locals when I was freshly 21. I've matured and so has GVR. What's new is the \"upscale\" and family friendly shopping mall around it; Whole Foods, REI, Cheesecake factory, etc.   The room are classic and clean. Nice bathrooms. The toilets flush.   However, easily the best thing about GVR is definitely their sand bottomed pool and lounge area. The pool is family friendly with lifeguards on duty. It's open from 8 to 8 and looks Vegas-y without all the t&a. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6kkxRV8H9SQLybj0xnEbMw?select=GUfzVjhVais7NgxIMc6EHw)  There isn't a fridge in the room, but I recommend their room service burger. Very good and high quality. Yes, there's a Fatburger downstairs which is almost the same price but it's crap. Save yourself the $24 and don't go for the lobster blt, the bacon overpowered the drenched in mayo lobster.  About a $140 night including all taxes/fees."}
{"text":"What Red Rock is to the Summerlin crowd, GVR is to the Henderson folk. Recent updates such as Pizza Rock and Sip have upgraded GVRs cool factor. Mercadito was going to open here too but after talking to employees at the Red Rock location, that isn't to be. Sob! This is my 'hood resort which is convenient but I like Red Rock better. Maybe cause I'm not quite within the GVR demographic of happily retired. That being said, there is plenty to do here from gaming to eating to movies. Hank's is a fine establishment and Drop Bar & Sip offer gaming while enjoying a swanky beverage or 2. I recently spent time at the pool and it was pretty enjoyable though a tad on the small side. It's unique because of the \"beach\" portion of the pool. The Pond is the adults only small pool and we didn't hang there this time. GVR is looking good for being almost 20, and it's good that they are adding/remodeling its offerings."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  Everyone who worked here worked very hard to make our stay enjoyable.  The valets were always able to give us directions.  We rented a cabana by the pool and the service was awesome.  Whatever we needed they were there.  The rooms were big, clean, and a great place to relax.  This might just be my new hotel for Vegas."}
{"text":"Absolutely lovely resort!  Sadly, the worst customer service I've experienced in a looonnnnng time.  Slow, systems issues galore (with NO sense of urgency what so fricken ever).  At EVERY point of contact the service sucked.  There was also a lack of employees, in general.  Example:  Took over an hour to get my lunch - a bowl of soup.  Should have known as it took 15 mins to get seated and there was lots of empty tables... Overall, a shame.  Such a lovely place."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Green Valley Ranch, I was like, this place is nice. The casino is not very big, but there were a ton of slots for us to play. We only like playing slots and drinking while we're in Vegas. That and lay out by the pool, and swim  and drink some more. Anyway, their Feast Buffet is nice. They've got Mongolian BBQ, a tasty salad bar with fancy greens, crab legs, etc etc. The usual LV buffet fare but with more quality. They've got a small food court for those not interested in standing in a super long line or eating until your pants bust open. Also, shops are close by. Hello Anthropologie!"}
{"text":"I would have rated this resort 5 stars had there been better ventilation in the casino. The cigarette smoke was overwhelming and very poorly ventilated. I would expect similar air-quality at a 2 or 3 star hotel but I feel it is unacceptable at a 4 1/2 star resort! The management staff were only able to offer me an apology. If you intend to use the casino for entertainment or dining, I would not recommend this resort."}
{"text":"Management still has not called me back to discuss this issue. Paid over $300.00 to be our in this dump of a room. It's suppose to be Deluxe king.. deluxe flop room maybe. Ick  How can they say that's too bad it's all we had? Ha nope found out they were in fact not booked up. We could have upgraded for a fee! That wasn't even brought up. They should have upgraded us period!! Also if you use their own booking it's considered third party and no refunds by the booking site. Can you say rip off?!"}
{"text":"Nice hotel. Far from strip but nice get away. Valet staff (Dennis) at front entrance was very rude. We found scratches on my brand new car and they were the opposite of friendly about anything."}
{"text":"Superb customer service from every department! From the valet and bellmen upon arrival, to the front desk upon check-in we felt a sincere welcome. We had to switch room only due to the error of a double beds instead of a king and all we had to do was sit tight. Someone came up immediately, switched us and even offered to fill our ice bucket.  We were there for a wedding so previously were not familiar with the resort. However, I'd love to return to experience all of amenities. It's great patronizing businesses where guests feel welcomed. You can genuinely tell the employees love their job too!"}
{"text":"Room's hot. They moved us to another room in the same tower (East). Not sure if I just had too much carbs, but it's still hot."}
{"text":"We checked in, and they gave us a room that had not been serviced yet. The room had been thrashed from the previous guests. When I called the concierge, she directed me to the manager. The manager stated that this was a mistake, and it happens. She had sent someone to bring us new cards for a new room instead of bringing them up herself. Once we were in our new room, the room was cozy and the additional amenities were good.  When we checked out, I let the employee know that we would be not returning. All she had to offer was an apology. Now being in the hospitality industry, one should try their hardest to win back any guest, but I'm assuming this does not apply for the GVR. It is Las Vegas after all, and I'm sure other people will fill their rooms."}
{"text":"I preface this review my noting that I do not gamble, nor have I stayed at Green Valley Ranch Resort & Spa. I have come on a number of occasions for the purpose of dining, watching movies and to enjoy some libations in the bars on property.   I don't frequent GVR mostly because I do not live in the area, but when I do visit, I'm reminded by how much I actually like this property. It's on the smaller side, which makes it more intimate and easy to navigate. It's clean and organized and the staff that I have encountered have always gone above and beyond to help direct me towards venues I'm trying to locate."}
{"text":"So many great things about this resort.   Loved staying offstrip for a quieter experience.     The good:.   Staff are great (see exception below).   Most staff here were fabulous.  The check in was smooth, the valet staff are lovely, one of the cleaning staff even offered to wait for me to get my Starbucks when she saw me hesitating to leave the guest access only area because I forgot my card.   The amenities here are awesome!  The pools are gorgeous and one pool has a sand bottom portion with a sand beach.     The only thing I will say needs to change is the pool staff.   For the most part the wait staff was okay but could definitely improve but what I found awful were the lifeguards.   The first day we were at the pool three lifeguards just talked amongst themselves and bottle flipped to keep themselves busy. Yes, bottle flipped - my 8 year kids favorite game.  There was even a point where a young child in the pool went face down in the water and the adult with them didn't notice and guess what? Neither did the lifeguards.   No kidding someone is going to die on their watch if they continue like this.  The second day here it was two lifeguards having a bromance looking at each other the whole time instead of at the pool.  I get that it's not that busy but it's a job that has some dangerous consequences if you aren't doing your job even for a moment.  Instead they were passing a life float between them for fun, talking about picking girls up at the bar to the point my husband had to leave becauae he didn't want to here their childish talk anymore.     Otherwise a fantastic stay.    I'd return here for sure."}
{"text":"The room my boyfriend stayed in for one night was a dump!  The room is so small, furniture is tacky (I wish I knew how to attach a picture) The room is dark, outlets don't work in the bathroom, television remote doesn't work! There's a bubbling sound coming from under the bathroom sink! Geez! It was like staying in a motel! It is not worth the rates that they charge for their rooms! I would not recommend GVR rooms, but I do love the restaurants in the hotel & the District."}
{"text":"Just say \"NO\" to having a small event (20-25 people) here.  You will get lost in the mix.  Our event was over priced and under served.   I travel a do small events around the country.  In the past 12 months I have been in 30 hotels and this one ranks in the bottom 3.  Many of the things such as introductions to Banquet captain, communication protocols for problem resolution and reviewing the contract on site before the event did not exist here.  Even the little things, like forks on the breakfast buffet for the $250.00 fruit tray would have been nice.  I'm not sure my clients enjoy eating with their fingers.   If you are looking for an event, avoid this resort.  I find my top 3 hotels are the Hilton, Marriott, and DoubleTree, with the DoubleTree having some of the best staff.  People make the event flawless, not $250.00 fruit trays."}
