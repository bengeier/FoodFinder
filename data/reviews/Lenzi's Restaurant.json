{"text":"Great meal every single time we go here! Salads are great and huge, burgers are even better. Staff is so friendly it feels as if you're eating in grandmas kitchen. Love it!"}
{"text":"We love Lenzi's.  Great family owned restaurant in the Mon Valley.  Be ready to eat as the portions are huge.  Good food, good people, and fantastic homemade desserts."}
{"text":"Favorite place. Delicious food, very friendly and welcoming group of folks, reasonable prices, generous portions.    Happy with each item so far after about six visits.   Homemade ravioli, very good sauce, good soup, homemade desserts.    This is a small place.  Byob."}
{"text":"This is the spot for good Italian food in Monongahela!  It looks like a small diner from the outside but once you go inside there is a great family atmosphere with delicious Italian dishes and AMAZING homemade cakes and desserts.  I go there several times a year and have not had a bad dish yet."}
{"text":"Very nice family owned restaurant. Great food and large portions. Always busy and a great treat!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to Lenzi's but they serve pretty good Italian food. Maybe a tad pricey for my taste, but you get what you pay for. I liked the lobster ravioli quite a lot. Very good salad. Nice and fresh."}
{"text":"This place makes some of the best food in the Valley, Everything is homemade and tastes wonderful. It is obvious they try very hard to keep their quality consistent and they do a very good job."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant.  A shining star for the area.  Truly homemade Italian food with great quality, fair prices and enormous portion sizes.

It is very, very small inside, so you need to plan out when you go.  The wait times to get a seat, however, don't take too long.  While everything is fresh, they are very quick with their food and do a good job at being prepped and prepared, so the tables turn over rather quickly.

Highly recommend anything they have.  You won't be disappointed.  

My usual go-to's here are any of their soups, their Chicken Marsala, Rigatoni with meat sauce, and their newer steak specials.  Ridiculously good steaks--to the extent that you would find in an upper, upper-end steak place.  

Desserts are phenomenal.  Homemade cakes, pies, and now, cannoli's.    

Would recommend them to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great little out of the way secret; one of the best Italian restaurants in the area! Fantastic home made food and great service. Lenzi's is small, a wait might be necessary at peak times, but worth the wait! Portions are huge, and prices reasonable."}
{"text":"This is a little treasure in the Mon Valley region.  Everything here is homemade!  My favorite is the gnocchi.  Make sure you come early because it goes fast! It's a family-owned business and well-known in the community.  If you're looking to support a 5 generation family business then come here and get a plate of food made with tradition and love. Also, get a slice of homemade pie! Any kind you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Like the food but don't say you are open until 7 and more than once at 6:15 and then at 6:24 say you WONT take a carry out order. We are not coming in to sit down. I know there is limited seating. Work all day thinking about eating there to be told you don't want the money. We spend $40 to $50 for carry out each time. Hey ! Post on you door that you will not take orders for carry out after a certain time as to not throw it back in the customers face. They have been there a while and wont miss a couple people not going there but if you keep doing this you will lose more."}
{"text":"This family owned gem is definitely a must stop if you're nearby. Take out or dine in the food is consistent. When you enter this small but very charming restaurant you will be greeted by one of the family members that run the place. All of the people working are beyond friendly and have that small town charm you can't find anywhere anymore. I usually order a salad with either chicken or shrimp that always has fries on it, you're in Pittsburgh how can't you have fries?!? All of the food however is solid from the Italian dishes to the sandwiches to the burgers. It never disappoints!!! The prices are reasonable and the portions are generous. If you have room for desert or just need to order a cake for an occasion; the cakes are out of this worlds. Classic looking but full of flavor!! Overall it's a staple in monongahela and one of the best places around in my book."}
{"text":"One of the best local family owned restaurants. The portions are huge.  Save room for dessert, the cakes are delicious.  Though the food is great Italian diner food, they have moved into the future by offering some gluten free options, including desserts."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying very good food , great portion size. Problem is staff, the older lady who is part owner , very rude, always acts like they don't want or need your business, will not ever go back.  Two times I have been turned down when trying to order food. Went in last night at 5:40 wanting to order to go salads, the restaurant however small was not full and the lady said \" what do you need?\" I said I wanted to order take out, she replied \" well it's going to be a really long time \". ( Note they close at 7) , I replied \" for salads ?\" She replied \" what kind\".....REALLY does it matter what kind, I kindly said forget it and walked out and came home and cooked dinner.  I will never go back in there again, I will take my business somewhere that they want to serve you."}
{"text":"I agree with folks who say this is a hidden gem in the Monongahela Valley. My wife and her family have been going here for years, but I only visited myself just recently. The portions are beyond generous. You'll take a doggy bag home with and have enough for a meal the next day. The pastas are very good, particularly the gnocchi, which seems to be famous. I think they serve the best meatballs I've ever eaten anywhere. The desserts are all homemade and equally enormous.  They seem to have a takeout business every bit as large as the sit-down dining business.  That's good, because they only have about a dozen tables in the place."}
{"text":"Best homemade Italian food in this area. I hope that you're hungry when you go. Very good food, prices, and a lot for your money. Very nice people and family"}
{"text":"Just happened to be in the area for my wife's appointment and found this little gem. It's a small family owned place that has been in the family for generations. They were so friendly and the food was fantastic. My wife thought the homemade cake looked so good she saved her lunch for dinner and went straight for the sweets. We will definitely go out of our way to go back."}
{"text":"Family member took me here. This place is great, home cooked meal! You get so much for the price you pay!  Try a burger I bet you will not be able to finish it, I had to take mine home."}
{"text":"It's definitely one of the best family owned restaurants around here. The service is always good you get big portions and excellent food."}
{"text":"Soooooooo good!! But closed Sunday and Monday :(
 You get either unlimited buttered bread or garlic bread  with every meal. Definitely get the garlic bread!!!!! 
The pastas are perfectly cooked and the sauce is amazing. I got the duo of lobster ravioli and gnocchi. My boyfriend got the 16oz cheeseburger to which I exclaimed \"holy ****\" when it arrived lol it looked like something you'd see as a \"challenge\" to finish at some restaurants. I love living minutes from here :)"}
{"text":"Very good food, for good price. Staff was friendly and attentive. You could tell it was a family owned company. I would definitely come back here. Had the chicken wings, husband had the chicken Parmesan. Food was quick, hot, and tasty. 

You definitely have to try the pies!"}
{"text":"Happened to be in Monongahela today, looked on Yelp and saw a restaurant w/4 1/2 stars?!?! Found it, looked like a converted Dairy Queen. I told my wife after seeing the place, 'I think I'm going to owe you on this one.' Not today...Lenzi's is that out of the way, family run, excellent food, friendly, really friendly staff restaurant with GREAT food that everyone hopes to find when they go to a new place hoping for the best.
Family run: while we were waiting, the owner filled us in on the restaurant's long history.  Some days the little granddaughter comes in, puts on her own apron, and goes around with a pad checking on customers.
Great selection of food. My wife had the lunch portion of Stuffed Polenta. They said the dinner portion is twice as big as the lunch size. There were a number of ways to 'stuff it'. My wife chose zucchini. The zucchini was breaded w/cheese and marinara sauce sort of in a polenta sandwich. The polenta was smooth and creamy. Great flavor a all working together to make a great lunch.
One review mentioned some food was pricey. The Polenta was $13.95, but it was OUTSTANDING and we could feast on leftovers for a few days
I chose the Pasta Italiano-pasta, large chunks of hot sausage (delicious) peppers, onions and marinara sauce. Both lunches came a tossed salad and garlic bread.
The ingredients were fresh and flavorful.
Our waitress was a dear. Five stars, when you put it all together 5+
We're already thinks of new reasons to drive through Monongahela again SOON!!
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ok, we knew the place with the previous generation running things & now with the next generation. The portions are enormous. The sauce is a tad on the herbaceous, garlicky side which intensifies on leftovers, but I like it fresh. The burgers are every bit as big, so if you're a burger lover, get a freshly made, freshly cooked big burger. Nice cakes, but I prefer the pies! Teeny-Tiny place, watch because they close at 7. Go early & enjoy the Italian homemade food diner."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I highly recommend the place. It has limited seating but it is worth the wait. You can also order to go which is a good option. The sauce on all of our different pasta dishes was really good. Be sure to save room for dessert. The pieces of pie they gave us were a meal themselves. We had lots of leftovers of our dinner and had to take our dessert home. You won't be sorry you stopped by."}
