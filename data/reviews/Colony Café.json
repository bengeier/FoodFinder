{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place! My husband took me during their grand opening (which happened to be my birthday). First of all, everyone who worked their was super friendly and attentive. We stopped for a glass of wine at the bar before we headed up to the cat loft for our visiting hour(which by the way you do need to reserve a time which is available on their website). The waitress was quirky and fun plus she recommended wines. You are allowed to bring drinks upstairs to the cat loft while you enjoy time with your furry friends (however, you are responsible to watch your own drink;)). The girl working in the cat loft was friendly and knowledgeable. My husband and I had a hard time deciding what cat we wanted to put in an adoption application for and we asked her a million questions. She had no problem answering them and did not get annoyed that I was acting like a crazy cat lady :). 
Adoptions are through animal friends so you shouldn't expect to go home the same day with a cat unless an adoption counselor from animal friends happens to be there also (one was not there when we visited). The adoption process took about two days and we adopted Latte(side note: all cats are renamed after a coffee or wine product). Lattee is now named Annie and she is the love of our lives! I fully support their mission and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to adopt a cat!"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere. Sweetheart of a barista/winetender. Enjoyed winding down our day here."}
{"text":"What a great experience! They have a very cute area where you can sit and order some coffee/tea. They also serve smaller sides and dishes. Very friendly and helpful staff! The cat room is located in the upstairs area where you can actually adopt the fur babies through Animal Friends. It is an $8 charge for an hour of cat cuddling and play time. Costs go back to  the cafe and kitties so it's well worth it. They do recommend you make a reservation prior to visiting so that you're guaranteed a spot with the kitties. I am exceptionally glad that they limit 10 people in the cat room so they don't overwhelm or stress them out."}
{"text":"Great concept, fantastic execution! Although Colony is the only cat cafe I've visited, the dedication of the team to ensuring a great experience for humans and felines alike made for a lasting impression. I can't wait to return!

I visited with my friend for a belated birthday celebration during the last Cat Loft hour on a Wednesday evening. We made our reservation about a week in advance. After checking in at the register, we watched the cats from the cafe until the start of our hour, at which point we joined about eight people and a dozen cats upstairs.

The limited number of visitors ensured that we got plenty of time with the cats, even with some sleeping or hiding. The Loft has plenty space for relaxing and lots of toys as well. A member of the Colony team stayed in the Loft with us and was more than happy to tell us more about the cafe and the cats. 

After our hour, we returned to the cafe. I had a frosted fudge brownie, and my friend had a cup of oolong tea. The brownie was quite large and very rich, but I was hoping for less sweetness and more of a chocolate taste. 

Overall, I had a great experience. The reservation fee for the Cat Loft is a little high for me to visit as often as I'd like, but I wouldn't hesitate to return for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Love!... nice people, good service, yummy snacks & great cocktails... oh, of course... kitties... many many cute kitties!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The coffee, the people, the atmosphere and the cats. Colony Cafe is now my go to place for coffee. 

Who wants to meet me there tomorrow at 11am and play with the cats?"}
{"text":"Honestly, I can't talk about the food because all I had was a tea.  I gave this because not only is the concept great, but I had a chance to meet one of the owners.  Through chatting with her, you could easily see that she genuinely cared for the well-being of the animals and really tried to talk them up in hopes of getting them homes.  It was clean, safe for the furkids and really a pleasant experience.

Addendum:  After taking time to read other reviews, I had an additional thought.  Please consider looking at the website before visiting.  The expectations around the cat loft are comprehensively reviewed there and it's not fair to give poor reviews based on personal neglect/irresponsibility."}
{"text":"The Colony Café has to be by far one of the coolest places I have ever visited.. while living in the burg!!  Located on Penn Avenue just across from the Amtrack Station.  As a huge cat lover.. I couldn't wait to check out.  Its been open for about a year now .. so overdue.  My boyfriend is too a cat lover so I surprised him with this \"after\" valentines day present.  Making reservations on the website was a breeze!!   $8.00 an hour per person - not bad at all!!!  There are other packages available that include wine too.   1 hour was plenty.  Our reservation for 11 AM on a weekday..we arrived early at 10:45 AM.  I inquired at the café if we were permitted to go up to the loft a few minutes early and of course it will just be an hour but it had to be at 11 .. our reservation time.  No problem..  I ordered a coffee with a shot of espresso in it.   Sandwiches were available to order too but we just had a big breakfast.   So when we were told it was ok to go up to \"cat loft\" I was the first.. couldn't wait!   Walking up the stairs and seriously yinz.. it was cat heaven!!! 

There was 12 cats - happy and playful .. most were very social!! Such a happy atmosphere for the cats. The hour flew by and we fell in love with every single cat!!   Each cat has a name tag with their name. Most cats were all ready adopted which was amazing. 98 adoptions to date..   Bravo!!!  

If you are a cat lover you must experience Colony Café!!!"}
{"text":"First time here for a private brunch. Included brunch and bottomless mimosas and then an hour in the car loft. Was treated very well by the staff and the food and drinks were great! When it was time to leave we were offered coffee to-go which was not originally included in our pre-paid brunch price. The service here is top notch! And hanging out with adorable cats was an added bonus."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a hot Irish latte which was delicious. But I ended up forgetting all about it the moment I stepped upstairs. So many adorable, playful cats and all available for adoption! If it weren't for my housing situation I surely would have gone home with at least one of them. Definitely a must see!"}
{"text":"I originally posted a 2 star review in response to the Colony Cafe's failure to issue me a refund for reservations made and cancelled well in advance. I received a response to my review here on Yelp, stating that my lack of refund was the result of an oversight. I appreciate that Colony Cafe responded to my review my refunding my $. I am less appreciative of the \"this could have been resolved if you had reached out to us directly\" bit in their response, and the rather obvious fact that they never caught it themselves. So-- they're trying, that much is clear, and I respect that, even if they seem to have some kinks to work out yet."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a great time this weekend celebrating my birthday at the Colony Cafe. I reserved a whole 1 hour time slot, and it was nice to have just our group up in the cat loft. We started out by arriving 30 minutes early. That was plenty of time to get drinks. We all pretty much got coffee or tea since it was early afternoon and everyone enjoyed it. My latte reminded me of the high quality coffee shops in Seattle, rich and deep, yummy! 

With drinks in hand we headed up to the cat loft and spent an hour (that went way too fast!) with their 10 or so adoptable cats. They ranged in age from kittens to seniors, and all had different personalities. Our group lounged on comfy couches and chairs and there was an abundance of toys to use to entertain and engage with the cats. A friendly woman was upstairs with us the whole time and answered any questions we had about specific cats.

In the end, one of our group really bonded with a sweet 15 month old girl, and submitted an adoption application! I hope it's happily ever after for them. They take a day or two to do background checks before anything is approved.

Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place for any cat and coffee (or tea) lover! 

With the cafe downstairs and the cat room upstairs, you can get a coffee and enjoy some quality time with kitties. (Note, you have to make a reservation to visit the cats and pay a small fee). My Lavender Vanilla Latte was delicious and amazing. There is a lack of gluten free food options, but they are still fairly new and are open to adding some options in the future. ALSO, all the cats are adoptable which is pretty cool. 

If you are in or visiting Pittsburgh and love cats, this cafe is a MUST VISIT."}
{"text":"What an experience! If you are a cat lover this is a must visit stop in Pittsburgh. 

First - make a reservation. 10-12 people are permitted to be in the cat loft at a time. It books up quickly. Redactions can be made online and last one hour. It's $8 per person. 

Second - parking. Depending on what time of day you visit street parking is available. I used the Greyhound bus station garage directly across the street. It's $5.00 for 2 hours or less. Super easy to find. When you take the elevator to the lobby the cafe is directly across the street. 

Third - arrive a few minutes before your session to order drinks and treats. You can place an order while you are in the loft, but it's nice to use your full time with the cats. 

The cafe itself is cute and trendy. I am a serial chai tea latte drinks and this one did not disappoint. I am not exaggerating when I say it may be one of the best ones I've ever had. Even my sister who doesn't typically drink them said she loved it. 

The loft is beautiful! Comfy chairs, benches and a glass over view to see downstairs to the cafe. They provide several bins of toys to use for play. Each of the cats have a name with their name on it. Some are friendly than others. They all arrive at different times. We visited with two cats who had only been in the loft for a day so they were a little timid. The cats range in age too and all are up for adoption.

I can't get over how incredible this concept is. I love that the cats are all adoptable. They receive so much love in the loft! I'd love to see more of this in the future."}
{"text":"Make sure to make a reservation! Especially if you are going on the weekend. My aunt and I walked in on a Saturday afternoon expecting we could play with the kitties, but were informed we needed a reservation and they were all booked for the day. As disappointed as we were, we still had a great visit. The cat room is on the second level, but there are glass windows so you can still get a decent view of the kitties while sitting on the first level. We shared the Goat Cheese & Fig Jam dish from the \"Small Bites\" section of the menu and devoured it! Such good flavor. Coffee is very nice brew. The owners were very friendly. Next time I am in Pittsburgh I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"What a cute little place.  Rescue animals and wine, two of my favorite things!  The cats here are all available for rescue, they have photos in the back detailing their ages and sexs.  The staff is all super friendly, the wine is good.  I didn't get to try the food but it smelled great.  

Make sure you sign up online to get a spot to play with the kittys.  I was lucky and went at 4pm on a Tuesday. I heard weekends get pretty packed.   ENJOY!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Came in for a student day (Thursdays - only $4 with ID!). Got a nice cinnamon plum tea (which come covered, alleviating my fear of a fuzzy tongue). I was greeted by the super nice attendant who explained the premise of the cat loft and then had a really relaxing afternoon! The kitties were so sweet and all up for adoption. You could play with them with a variety of toys. It was all very neat, and the decor was trendy. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, playing with the cats for a hour was awesome. But my five star rating is mainly due to the awesome sandwich/latte I had after my session with the cats. I ordered a latte with the vanilla lavender syrup and the French melt (grilled cheese). The latte was sweet and had a good balance of vanilla with hints of lavender. My favorite part of the entire experience had to be the French melt. It has a filling comprised of Brie cheese and orange marmalade. The marmalade was sweet, citrusy and bright which contrasted perfectly with the Brie. To any Brie lovers out there this is the sandwich for you."}
{"text":"Cons- Worst expresso I have ever tasted. We couldn't quite figure it out but a hint of chemical-tasting \"something\" was present in our drinks. We couldn't even finish them. To make it worse, it was obvious the barista was clueless in making our coffee and took 11 minutes to receive the expresso. It would have been fine if it was at least drinkable.

You have to make a reservation to see cats up for adoption for $8?? I can go to the humane society and see cats for free whenever I want. I would be more than okay paying, maybe, $4 and waiting in a short line to see them if the cafe is really trying to make a buck for the sake of getting the cats adopted. I think the business model needs tweaked.

Pros - very friendly staff. The cafe itself is humble in size but it has a lot of character and plenty of space. Decent size drink menu, too, including wine and small plates, all within decent price points.

In all, pretty disappointing experience. We came to drink coffee and pet kitties (maybe take one) and we couldn't do either of the two."}
{"text":"Definitely a must see! I'm from San Diego, stopped by and found this amazing place. You can have a healthy bite or a glass of wine and play with or adopt a cat.  Animal rights folks and cat lovers ... A must stop !"}
{"text":"GO.HERE. NOW.

I went last night at a 7-8PM slot.  My boyfriend got out of work a little late and then we got lost getting there; I was worried we'd missed our appointment start time and wouldn't be allowed in.  We were warmly greeted and just lost the time we missed, which we were totally fine with and appreciative no one told us to turn around!

There were only three other visitors there but everyone was friendly, the owner was incredibly informative. As of last night, 36 adoptions have resulted from Colony Cafe's efforts!  This place is such a great idea.  Even if you're not looking for a cat to adopt, it's still a nice opportunity to meet a bunch of friendly kitties and relax for an hour.  It is incredibly clean; I have one cat and my place doesn't look half as nice as Colony!!  I also have allergies to cats and, not on medication, I was fully prepared to be sneezing my face off.  I didn't sneeze once!  

I've seen a few complaints on Yelp about the $8 entrance fee - $8 an hour for total relaxation among some adorable cats is nothing.

I loved the feel of the cafe.  My boyfriend got wine and enjoyed it.  We definitely plan on coming back and enjoy the cafe itself.  The vibe is beautiful and the open window concept utilizes the space so wonderfully."}
{"text":"I am in no way a cat person, but had to check it out.  So I grabbed my two best cat lady friends and headed downtown.  I like something new and interesting so hand me a glass of wine and I am in.  I like the concept of the cafe with its innovation of putting two very different things together: Coffee and cats  Being not an animal person, I had a fun time people watching and listening and my Cabernet was great.  

NON CAT RELATED:  The staff at the Cafe was amazing.  Very nice people that project a true belief in their business.  This reflected passion and caring for humans and felines alike is felt within their minimalist, cat inspired walls.  
I enjoy the fact that you can get coffees, adult coffees, wines and other drinks.  They had some interesting looking mature appetizers, but we didn't eat. 
Remember that this is a family friendly.  Please remember that when you are in the cat loft. (A young girl got an earful of some adult convo during our hour)  It is a small space and overall a \"quiet space\" so any conversations are heard."}
{"text":"Made an appointment with the wife to spend some time with the not yet adopted cats.  Strongly recommend making reservations 3-4 days in advance as many of the time slots were filled when we were looking to make an appointment. It was $8.00/person.   Arrived about 15 minutes before our schedule appointment and was able to order coffee from their large espresso/coffee bar.  They also have breakfast type food.  The food is similar to what you would find at most large name coffee shops.  They also offer wine and beer.  The main level offers plenty of seating at little tables and chairs.  The bathrooms were spotless as well.

The upstairs area is where the cats are and where you go when it is your time to see the animals.  There are about 10-12 cats available for adoption upstairs.  We were the first group there for the day so the cats were jacked with lots of energy.  There are a decent amount of seats for you to sit on and plenty of toys for you to play with the kitties with.  

This is a great spot if you are a cat fan or an animal fan.  All cats are up for adoption and I believe there have been 50+ adopted since they opened.  Kudos for a great idea and hopefully more and more cats find a forever home."}
{"text":"What a truly wonderful place.

My trip to Colony Cafe has been something I've been dreaming about for as long as the idea for it has been public. I remember walking from the Strip District to downtown and stopping in my tracks to read the sign; it was hand-written, on a long sheet of brown paper. It wasn't especially conspicuous, but I felt the urge to stop and read it. My excitement built the more I read: the premise of a Cat Cafe in Pittsburgh was a dream come true!

Fast forward to now. I finally organized a cat loft visit with friends. Yes, you absolutely do need to reserve a spot ahead of time, because Colony's cats are like celebrities. They started as rescues, and in the blink of an eye became local social media stars. Getting in to see them should be treated the same as getting backstage passes to see the Spice Girls in '97... Or at least kind of close.

The loft is a small space, but cleverly utilizes vertical space to keep the cats plenty entertained. There are cat trees and cushions, bean bag chairs and couches for human comfort. You can order food, booze, or coffee to bring up as well, which is lovely, but keep an eye on your order... because kitties.
The woman who runs the loft itself is around during your visit, to answer your questions, but also to watch over the cats. It's very apparent she cares a great deal for each one of them. She is a fantastic and caring person;  I forgot to ask her name, because I'm awful with meeting new humans... However, by the end of my hour there, I knew each and every cat's name!
There's a notebook where you can read about other people's experiences, as well as leave any tidbits you'd like to share.
The food is pricey, but worth it. I recommend the Goat Cheese and Fig Jam spread. It is heavenly.
And let's talk drinks. The Panther is my favorite cocktail... Okay, I've only tried two! But the marriage of coffee and cream bourbon is a beautiful, magical thing.
I so highly recommend this place. I'm already planning a trip back with some more friends! Spread the kitty love!"}
{"text":"Came here since I saw that a new coffee shop had opened up and so I wanted to try out its coffee. Located near downtown just on the border between the Strip District and Downtown, it's a relatively easy place to get to and access though parking can be difficult to find during peak times (there is a parking garage across the street from here though). In general, there is a decent amount of seating in the interior, some rather comfortable, but also including a bunch of tables and chairs throughout the establishment. I tried one of their Chai Tea Lattes. Though it wasn't the best I've had, it was decent though I do wish it had a bit more flavor and kick to it (more chai tea spice in the drink, please?). They also sell pastries of various sorts as well. There's also a cat cafe upstairs, but since it seems to be extremely popular you'll have to make a reservation/pay ahead for time to spend in such if that's what you're into, haha. From what I could see as a casual observer, it does look kinda fun. Lots of cats upstairs for you to play/interact with ... I can see why people like it. Will come back to try some of their other offerings ... probably more coffee-based drinks next time so I can get a better idea of how good this shop's coffee is. Worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This is place is great! What a cute and novel idea. A place for coffee and cats. Best part is, I'm not even a fan of cats. In fact, I hate them.

Sorry.

But the cats here are freaking cute. Whether it's a nice caffeine or wine buzz that allowed me to mentally adopt one of these adorable felines, I have no idea, but I loved it.

Small selection of drinks that either go straight to your head or your liver and small furry domestic beings to swoon over.

If anyone's going to instill the love for cats in me, it's going to be colony café.

Unique idea, glad they opened one in Pittsburgh, wonderful asset to this city and the best location ever! 

Kudos!"}
{"text":"What a lovely coffee shop!  I was recently in Pittsburgh for a long weekend and I loved this spot that I stopped in twice:  once for wine and a second time for coffee!  

I did NOT interact with any cats because 1) I am allergic to them and 2) we didn't have an appointment.  If you are coming here and expecting to meet some kitties, you will want to call ahead of time and schedule a reservation.  We saw a lot of folks come in and leave disappointed because they didn't know that this shop required reservations to meet with the cats.  

If you're not interested in meeting a cat, this is a perfect quiet place to enjoy coffee, wine and pastries.  They have a super large menu and the cafe is extremely cozy. It was by far the best coffee shop I visited in Pittsburgh.  

I loved the decor.  It was so warm and inviting.  I also liked the fact that they sell various items such as their own wines and tote bags, etc.,  - it's a nice touch.  The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable.  They even made their whipped cream from scratch!  Great coffee shop - you should definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Beware cat lovers.  I've visited cat cafes in various locations and have had awesome experiences.  If you want to visit this place you have to prepay and schedule online.  I was passing through with my family so I booked a few hours in advance.  When we arrived, all the pay and free parking was taken due to a baseball game.  I called the cafe and we tried to reschedule.  They tried to accommodate us but the times offered didn't work out.  I asked for a refund due to the parking and was told parking was not their problem.  They refused a refund and did not offer any compromise (price break or something). They just kept the $32.  They should post this practice or work with the customer.  Either way, post the fact that they have no control over parking and visiting is at your own risk.  Sorry we missed the kitties.  Just a heads up."}
{"text":"Love love love it here. Great drinks, good food, and kitties. Staff is always super friendly. I'm allergic to cats but I never have any issues here because they keep it so clean. The only suggestion I have would be to have the upstairs employee to offer drinks and food upstairs. I only suggest this because in my usual hurry to get upstairs I usually don't order a drink downstairs (and I have been told to order upstairs) but without the employee offering, I hate to just go up to them when they are doing something, with cats, or talking with other guests and asking for a drink, it feels a bit too demanding lol. I just think that with the verbal offer to grab drinks here and there, they would sell a lot more."}
{"text":"Found the employees to be very unwelcoming and pretentious. I was corrected on how to say my wine, how to order bourbon, told I couldn't even peer in the window to look at the cats (let alone go into the room). Not used to the unwelcoming vibe in Pittsburgh but... you've got it here! Talk about taking yourselves too seriously."}
{"text":"Enjoyable relaxing atmosphere. The house made vanilla lavender flavoring syrup is delightful."}
{"text":"This cafe is a dream come true! Snuggling cats while drinking champagne? Count me in! I visited for my first time this week and was entirely impressed. It was fun to watch the cats reveal their personalities as I played and pet them. Even the food is yummy! I recommend the arugula salad. Just don't feed the kitties. Be sure to pre-register online before visiting. Most importantly though, enjoy yourself in this cat paradise."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and it was my first cat cafe! The concept hasn't come to Buffalo yet, so I have to visit Pitt to see the glory.

I came here later in the evening when it was too late to play with a cat (sorry whiskers!), but I did enjoy a cup of coffee and a delicious coffee! The coffee was delicious and smooth and they do pour overs. The cookie was super gooey and delicious too.

Loved Colony Cafe! Hope to come back and play with an actual cat :)."}
{"text":"I love the fact that you can drink wine or coffee and hang out with cats! The atmosphere is awesome here. You can come in and not have to interact with the cats at all. They also have some delicious food. Love it!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh finally has a cat café and it is amazing!! 

I stopped in for tea a few times before actually having time to make an appointment for the cat room. The café is bright, open and very welcoming. The cats are kept up on the second floor, but there is a glass wall up there so you are able to see the cat room from down below! They have a variety of coffee, tea and wine as well as a few specialty cocktails.

I have not eaten here yet, although they do offer baked goods as well as a menu of small bites such as avocado toast, hummus & pita, cheese plates and charcuterie.

I couldn't believe how popular this place has become! We had a group of 8 and had to make our reservation about a month in advance! Evenings and weekends book up fast, so plan ahead! Your visit is $8 per person for one hour in the cat loft, up to 10 people at a time. The cat loft is amazing! A nice open space with plenty of cat trees, beds, toys and furniture. As a mama of two cats, I know how hard it can be to keep things clean and smelling nice, and I was very impressed by the cleanliness of the room! Their litter boxes are hidden from view, behind a wall where the cats can come and go as they please through small openings. 

There were probably around 8 cats in the room, of varying colors, sizes, ages and personalities. If you are a cat person, you likely already know the vast spectrum of kitty temperaments! Some were sleepy, some were playful and some were a little more sassy! If they want to be left alone, leave them alone! They deal with people coming and going all day but still need to get their 20+ hours of daily sleep.

I loved playing with all of the kitties here and will gladly go back again soon! I'm not in the place right now to adopt another cat, but when I am, I will definitely keep this place in mind!"}
{"text":"I visited the Colony cat cafe at 5 PM on a Saturday. I mingled with cats and ate charcuterie and cheese/fruit/nut platters. Most of the cats were outgoing, jumping for treats and sometimes fighting each other. Baskets of toys were available. Some cats had low-key personalities. The food was promptly brought up to the room, and I enjoyed its taste."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Honestly just visited with friends from out-of-town as a lark.  

I'm allergic to cats and take medication, but I was concerned that an hour inside the upstairs cat loft would stretch pharmaceutical science and my lungs to their limits.  It did not.  I found the loft to be immaculately clean...precious little cat hair migrated to the furnishings, no smell, no messes...just a bunch of EXTREMELY docile well-groomed kitties.  

Unlike Dobby, my cat (I hope you're reading this, Dobby), they were all extremely accepting of petting and cuddles and did not tear ass all over the room destroying my furniture for no apparent reason.  They seemed very at home in the loft and cavorted happily in and amongst the cat castles strategically interspersed among the more people-suited couches and chairs.  

You guys...they serve liquor.  I ordered their version of a French 75 (some cat-related name derivation or other) and it was delicious.  

One complaint, and it is minor, is that it wasn't immediately apparent who actually worked there.  She had a laptop and I honestly thought she was just some young lady enjoying a stress-easing change of work (or study) venue, sitting on one of the couches, absently petting a cat.  Once I realized she worked their, she happily and readily parted with the laptop, took my order and disappeared downstairs to fill it.  

Service upstairs is necessarily slow.  One waitress per 10 people (they limit the loft to 10 at a time) and a trip downstairs then up.  Service downstairs I didn't experience, having arrived a bit late and escorting my friends immediately upstairs for our reservation.

I'd return.  I'd order a drink five or so minutes before my reservation, take it up and then order another after I got there if the spirit moved me.  Just more convenient that way.  Definitely worth a visit with a cat lover.  Reservations required for the cat loft."}
{"text":"I love the cat cafe! I have been here three times, I like that each time it's different cats because they are constantly getting adopted. 

The cafe downstairs is nice, I've gotten coffee and hot chocolate from there. Nothing special but it was nice we could bring our drinks to the cat loft. 

The loft is nice, lots of seating and always a lot of cats around. If possible it's better to time your visit so it's in the morning or just after their break as they will be more willing to engage. 

The people in the loft can really make or break the experience. One time I was there, there were a few kittens but a group of teenagers held the kittens the whole time, it would have been nicer if they had shared. 

In any case, I would definitely recommend the place if you love playing with cats."}
{"text":"do not go here. this is an underground cat brothel operated by a group of wannabe hipsters. never  before have i needed to make a reservation to pet a goddamn cat."}
{"text":"One of the cutest cafes in Pittsburgh! The cafe is housed on two levels- the bottom floor being the cafe seating area (not cats), and the top floor being the cat lounge. The upstairs cat lounge is not incredibly spacious, but is well designed considering it's small size. There are many comfortable seating options (for both humans and our feline friends) as well. The lounge has no more than ~9 cats at a time, and no more than 10 humans at a time to ensure that it doesn't get too crowded/stressful for the cats, and so that the staff can keep the lounge clean and sanitary. There is a good variety of active and more docile cats in a wide age range all of whom are available for adoption!

If you visit the upstairs cat lounge, I would recommend not ordering any big dishes during your hour so that eating won't take away from your bonding with the cats! (Also, the table options aren't that great so anything more than a coffee is kind of inconvenient.) If you do choose to order food though, you won't be disappointed. The food is tasty and of good quality. The food and drink options are a little on the expensive size, but much of the money is going to care for the cats so it's worth it. 

Note: The Cafe is still pretty new and consistently booked, so you will most likely need to set up a reservation online ahead of time if you plan on going to the cat lounge. Also, there is a conveniently located parking garage just a short distance away from the cafe."}
{"text":"My SO took me here as a surprise for our anniversary.  He registered us ahead of time for one hour in the upstairs cat room.

The cafe on the first floor was very modern, comfortable, and clean. There was a good selection of drinks and a few desserts/pastries for a snack. They also stocked some souvenir items like t-shirts and beer koozies for sale. I got a koozie for only $1 to commemorate my experience there.

I will say that we were greeted and told that as needed to check in, but it took almost 15 minutes for the woman to come over and check us in. In the meantime, she was preparing drinks and gabbing with regulars.  I can appreciate the laid-back vibes, but it's kind of a sour first impression for me. Thankfully, it was redeemed when we were able to go upstairs.

Prior to going upstairs, we both ordered a cocktail; they were priced for the standard and had cute names (I got a Calico-inspired one). They were very good and they were brought upstairs to us.

There were 14 cats for us to mingle with for an hour. They were a nice variety of breeds, ages, and sexes.

The space was very clean and you got used to the very minimal litter smell quite quickly.  There were plenty of toys for us to engage the cats with. There was lots of beds, cat scratchers, and fluffy rugs for them to enjoy. This place really does care about the cats, and it was a really cute space. There was plenty of seating, though we found ourselves all congregating together as we followed the cats around to play and pet. 

They also brought out some cat treats for us to use to feed them since the cats were a little sluggish from a child's birthday party earlier that day. I thought that was very nice of them.

All-in-all, I very much enjoyed myself at the Colony Cafe.  I think it's a wonderful thing that they are doing to provide a more relaxing and comfortable experience for both cats needing a home and their potential owners or just people wanting to give them some love.

I encourage any potential cat owner to visit this place and give it a try. You will give a cat a forever home that they deserve! And if you cannot take in a cat, consider sponsoring one, so when the right person comes along for them, they won't be burdened by the price. You can talk to staff about sponsorships.

One more awesome thing- there's a public parking garage right across the street! We were there for about 2.5 hours on a weekday and it was only $5. Awesome that we didn't have to trek all through downtown or fight for parking. Definitely a huge plus for a downtown location!!!"}
{"text":"Best. Cafe. Ever. The cafe on the first floor is beautiful and offers a decent variety of specialty coffee drinks and snacks (mostly dips). We did not look into or try the wine selection. With our latte, we went up to the cat loft to hang out with the cats! The upstairs was well maintained with all the cats roaming around, and was under proper surveillance from the employee. I wish we could have adopted this one cat, but we are not a living situation that allows us to do so :(. We will definitely be returning here for the coffee and the cats!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to visit! I booked a visit to the cat loft and then had a little lunch at the cafe. Both were so awesome. The cat room was so well handled and organized, and the cats were so sweet. The food was delicious as well! I had the goat cheese dip, and the ladies at the counter hooked me up with extra bread for dipping. It was a great way to spend my birthday. I'll be back as often as possible!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays ago with my wife and her parents for our morning coffee.  Colony Cafe is on the Pittsburgh Coffee Passport which is why we happened to stop by on this day but if I am being honest, as a cat lover, I have had it bookmarked on Yelp for quite awhile. You see Colony Cafe is a place where you can get your coffee and play with cats!  The Cafe is located downstairs while the cat area is upstairs.  You need to register with the front desk to go and play with them and they only allow 10 people an hour.  Unfortunately on the day that I was there they were already booked up for the day (you can register online) and so I didn't get to play with any cats.  Still I could see a number of them as colony cafe has clear glass on the second floor so that cats can do what they do best, look down at you.  Other than that they have a small area where some cat merchandise is for sale and then near the bathroom they have a wall full of black and white photos with pictures of celebrities with cats.  For my coffee on this morning I decided to go with one of their specialties and so chose the lavender vanilla latte.  Within a few minutes of ordering, my wife and I had our lattes and we headed over to some seats to drink them.  The latte ended up being pretty good even if I would have been hard pressed to tell you there was coffee in it.  You see it was a little sweet and had some vanilla tones to it.  Then every once in a while I would pick up some lavender notes from it as well which was nice.  So overall it was a drink that I enjoyed, I merely wish it had some more coffee flavor to it.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I love the idea of coffee and cats and hopefully next time I am actually able to visit the cats!"}
{"text":"Cons:  we were told that we needed a reservation to see the adoptable cats, also the fee was $8/person for 1hour.. you could go to the humane society to spend as much time as you wanted there for free.. also the barista looked like she had NO idea what she was doing, both of our espressos tasted like chemicals, no matter the sugar that I put in it.. I took one sip and I couldn't drink anymore. 

PROS: great atmosphere in the cafe, cozy and unique and friendly staff. 

I really wanted to like this place, but the concept just doesn't seem to make any sense... it's a great idea but I don't think they're going about it the right way. I'd they really wanted to help cats get adopted, they wouldn't go about it this way. Also get better trained baristas - I've been a barista for 4 years and espresso should NEVER taste like that. So disappointed. All we wanted to do was have a cup of coffee and snuggle kittehs. I do think I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"Not bad, considering that it's Pittsburgh's first cat café. The bottom part of the café is free, but to visit the cat loft, you have to book a reservation beforehand. It's $8 a person, and you must confirm how many people will be attending at the time of booking. Weekends and bigger groups fill up months in advance, so plan ahead! The lower level cafe area is pleasant, calming and a wonderful place to do work or chat with a friend. 

My friend and I arrived early, and with a minute or so until our cat loft time, she let us go up! 
The cat loft was relaxing, quiet, and had around 6-8 cats, most of which were hidden in various places but came out to play during the course of the hour! You can order any food or drink from either the register or upstairs while in the cat loft and enjoy it while you play with the cats! The only caveat is that you don't feed the cats, of course. 

I ordered an appetizer, a pesto dip with bread, before we went up and a sandwich (the mango chutney) while up there. The food was very underwhelming, though the mango chutney itself was tasty. A bit too sweet, though. All of it was way overpriced, in that this place is more upscale than, say, a Crazy Mocha. They offer a lot of baked goods and coffee and tea beverages, however, which is a plus! They also have two wines, a house red and house white, which you can also enjoy in the cat loft!  

Bottom line: great time playing with the cats! Come here for that, or for your afternoon coffee fix, but the food is worth a try if you're willing to spend extra."}
{"text":"A friend who is a fellow cat lover was visiting from out of town and we really wanted to visit the Cat Colony Cafe.  I live in Pittsburgh but hadn't had a chance to visit myself so I was excited to go.  Our only free day to go was on a Friday and I thought it wouldn't be an issue to get a spot on a weekday during the day, but I did go to book it a couple days in advance just in case and there was only 1 spot left the entire day.  I booked that spot assuming we could just split the hour and do a half hour each, though I was bummed we couldn't go up at the same time but though it wouldn't be a big deal.  We planned to just split our time between the outside cafe area and the cat loft. My friend has mild cat allergies even with meds so she didn't want to spend a whole hour in there anyway.  She loves cats and cuddling with them but has to limit her time so her allergies don't get too bad and the small enclosed glass loft full of cats made her a bit nervous about spending an entire hour, so we thought splitting the time would be perfect.  When we got there they refused to let us split the time and said there was no chance of any other spot opening up. They said it was because people in and out of the room would be disruptive, but we didn't really want to be in the room the entire hour anyway, especially my friend with the allergies.  So if my friend booked and hour and have to leave after 20 min would they be upset about the too since it was disruptive having the door opened? 

I think this could be a great concept and I was really excited to see it, but I'm just really disappointed how rigid and expensive it is.  $16 for the two of us plus the price of our coffee to spend time with cats seems pretty steep, especially if they want to build repeat clientele.  I already have a cat and am considering another and would love the chance to just pop up there occasionally when I'm in the area to see what cats are there up for adoption but it just wouldn't be feasible for me to have to plan a set time and book at least days if not over a week in advance and pay $8 every time.  And if you are getting a cat together with a partner or family members where you want to make an adoption decision together then everyone has to pay $8 each so this can get steep pretty fast!  Admittedly I did notice on their website FAQ after that they did post this wasn't possible, but that wasn't on there when I first checked out their website and I have never heard of any other restrictions from places that allow cat visiting that are trying to adopt out cats, where visits are usually shorter than an hour.  I know there are other cat cafes in other cities or countries where the cats are mixed in the same main cafe area and there aren't such rigid rules and expensive costs regarding cat visits and those seem to work well, so I was really hoping they would follow that model. If I worked downtown I know this would be the sort of place I would want to just stop by 15 min on my lunch break, have a coffee and hang with cats before going back to work, but with the rigid system they have, those type of visits just won't be possible. I get they seem to really care about the well being of the cats, which is really important, but they should choose cats for the cafe who have an easy going friendly personality where it won't be scary for them having to meet lots of visitors throughout the day, regardless of the schedule or frequency.  Some cats are just not well suited for a place like this. I think with their model they will unfortunately have a hard time with having a regular customer base, and once the novelty of it wears off people will stop going.  The non-cat part of the cafe was pretty deserted, probably because anyone without an advance registration would have no chance of even a glimpse of cats all day. They did end up giving me my $8 back since we couldn't both visit, but I lost the 2 hours of parking I had already paid for anticipating hanging out in their cafe for awhile before and after the cat visit."}
{"text":"I absolutely fell in love with the warm and welcoming atmosphere of the Colony Café. The entire staff are friendly and the owners are so compassionate about their mission. The menu and drink selection are also awesome. The Cat Loft is immaculate and there is always a staff member on site to answer any questions visitors may have. This is my new favorite place. The cats are pure \"purrrrfection\" !"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee shop and wine bar and cat loft! I sincerely love spending time with the kitties here drinking a glass of wine."}
{"text":"I've been to Colony Cafe twice already and have loved it both times. The area for the cats is spacious and cozy for both visitors and the cats. The wine and drink selection isn't huge but it's nice and they have snacks and pastries .

Overall I think what they are doing there is great."}
{"text":"Such a cute café! The cats were very cute and fun to play with. Definitely coming back for another visit soon."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about the Colony Cafe! Such a cool place to hang out with adoptable cats, eat and even have a coffee and a glass of wine! Special cat loft which has around 14 adoptable cats at all times. You do need to reserve your hour spot to spend in the loft with the cats but it is worth every dollar! It cost $8 a person for 1 hour in the cat loft when we were last there a few months ago. If you plan to eat, I recommend coming early to eat and taking a drink into the loft just so you can spend more time playing and snuggling with the cats! You are allowed to bring what you order into the room, but it's so much more fun to focus on the kitties when you're there. You'll find that the hour flies by and you'll be looking forward to booking your next trip here! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a treasure! This little cafe has some tricks up its sleeve. First it is a great quality local-sourced coffee spot. They are enthusiastic about doing it right. Clean bright beautiful space. I'm not a wine drinker but like social vibe it brings and late hours for Pgh standard... what I didn't have time to explore is the upstairs... this is where the cats roam free and you can pay 8 bucks to bask in their adoptable loveliness. I will update this review once I get in there... but the staff were sweet and cafe was  a winner... so my hopes are high!"}
{"text":"First, I love the concept.  All about the concept of getting an hour of reserved time in a room full of cats for 8.00 an hour, as I'm a cat owner and lover myself.  You get to spend that time with 9 other humans and around 10 cats or so (and wonderful cats I might add) in a very clean room with many areas and places to sit. What a wonderful way to get cats in front of potential human adopters. And, it does sound wonderful to get some food and drink from the downstairs café and bring it upstairs to the cat room so you can nosh while petting said cats.

OK, here goes the bashing.  The business model or, at least the execution last evening between 7pm and 8pm (last hour of visitation) was not a good one for the cats.  First, we enter the café to let them know we have a reservation and are directed to go upstairs and we do.  Once there, no one greets us, meaning no one is checking to see if we had reservations or just walked in off the street.  We couldn't tell who was a visitor and who worked there for quite some time.  Later we noticed that most of the time we were visiting (we visited only 50 minutes because it didn't seem necessary to use the whole allotted time), there were no staff present in the room.  The other thing greatly noticed was that try as you may, you, as the visitor, are not going to be paying close enough attention that you have left your food and drink unattended and in reach of one of the cats.  You're going to be busy playing with and visiting with the multiple cats. Case in point -- another visitor had to let me know that a cat was headed for my diet coke and I had to remove a chocolate brownie left unattended by another visitor from the reach of a cat.  Neither of us human visitors are bad people, just caught up in the moment with all the cats.  

My husband and I were the last ones to leave the room and it was unsupervised at that time.  It occurred to me that it would have been quite easy for us to snatch up a cat and tuck it under our coat or slip it into a big purse and head out with no one noticing.  Yes, we had to exit through the downstairs café, but still, no one would have noticed.  (P.S.  After discussing with the co-owner, Sue, she assured me staff is always alert and on the watch plus they have video cameras in operation so that's a relief to know.)

Sooooo, bottom line, I'm all about the kitties and their welfare.  The cat room should have an employee in there at all times there are human visitors and they should closely monitor the food/drink situation if they are going to continue to allow food/drink.  Surely, they know the consequences of a cat eating/drinking certain human foods.  Should I even have to point out the fact that chocolate can be lethal to a cat?  

Because of concerns for the cats' safety (health and welfare), I give one star until/unless the business model is rectified.  To be fair, I've also written to the management with my concerns.

**** UPDATE ****  I just had a very constructive conversation with Sue, the co-owner.  She actively and warmly listened to my concerns about the safety of the cats, mainly concerned with 100 percent supervision of the Cat Loft during visiting hours and actively monitoring the visitors' food/beverages being in reach of the cats given some of its toxic nature to cats.  I came away feeling assured that she heard my concerns, along with feedback from other visitors, and is open to making needed changes for the cats' safety.   Therefore, I'm upgrading my review.  I still intend on re-visiting soon so that I can give the highest grade."}
{"text":"Recently visited Colony Cafe for the first time and had a relaxing experience with the cats. The Peach tea that I ordered was delicious and we were pleased to see that they serve a number of wines and beers. Book your spot ahead of time as the time slots for the cat loft fill up days in advance (for Saturday's, at least). Having a beer and playing with cats is a great way to spend an afternoon."}
{"text":"Grab some coffee, work in a chill environment with good indie music and then head upstairs to relax with and/or adopt kitties.  This place rules!  A mashup of 'Animal friends' charity to find rescue pets homes."}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love. Love the concept. Love the food and drink offerings. LOVE the Cat Loft. 
Reservations are required to chill out with the felines in the Cat Loft. It is $8 an hour. They keep 9-12 cats at a time. All of the cats are adoptable. They are provided by Animal Friends. The loft is warm, cozy, and welcoming. Only 10 people are allowed in at a time so you need to make a reservation online. Minimum age to go to the Cat Loft is is 8 years old. You can even start the adoption process if you fall in love with one (or more). In my opinion it is totally worth the $8. Plus if you adopt a cat from here you already know they are well socialized. 
The main floor is where you can have small bites, soups, Charcuterie boards, etc. we tried the Hummus and it was very flavorful. It was a large portion of Hummus. We also had the olives. It was also a nice size portion. There were 3 different types of olives. We liked all 3. Our food order was basic but we know if you do the basics well, that you will do everything else well. I ordered the Riesling and my hubby ordered the Chardonnay.  Both were served in a very nice plastic glass that you can take up to the cat loft. If you are not going to the loft you would get an actual glass. 
I will definitely be coming back just to try more items on the menu like the Melts and desserts."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here for a while now I was going to try and make a reservation to be able to go up to the loft with the cats but the cafe was closed on Monday. Not a big deal my friend and I still went to look around and have a glass of wine. We ate already earlier but the food selection on the menu looked very tempting. We just drank our wine and watched the cats from the loft it was a nice time I will definitely have to make a reservation so I can hang out with the kitties next time."}
{"text":"The Colony Cafe reliably makes a good cappuccino without burning the milk or coffee. Service is always fast and friendly and the establishment is quite clean. The only thing I'd like to see changed is earlier hours. Opening at 8 is pretty late for a coffee shop."}
{"text":"The Colony Cafe is awesome--we can't wait to come back. Just make sure you schedule in advance! 

I strongly disagree with any negative reviews of the Cat Loft--they seem sore and misplaced. The idea of the loft is well executed. It was super cute, very fun, and definitely relaxing. It seems to be a great (& safe!) thing for both people and cats.

The bar/cafe area is warm and inviting, and the menu was wide. The staff was so friendly and exceptionally welcoming. We came as part of our anniversary night and they were very kind and accommodating to us. 

Overall, this was a great experience! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place by accident when walking back from our brunch spot. After ordering our drinks we realized you could sit with a room full or cats above us. My husband and I decided to try it out lol unfortunately we were stopped and said: we didn't have an appointment and that it's was 8$ to hang with the cats. Really? If we just dropped $18 on 2 Mimosas I think I should get 15 weird minutes with some cats."}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about Colony Cafe. Jumping straight to the important part, after making our 1-hour reservation online (on the opening night actually!), I got to spend time among a group of friendly, cuddly and purring cats of all ages. Walking through a door and up some stairs, you enter the cat area, which has plenty of furniture, rugs, cat toys and more. Just from sitting down, you will have cats approach you, looking for some pats and snuggles. You can bring your drinks upstairs (in provided plastic cups), so you can enjoy a glass of wine while you play.

Downstairs is a comfortable wine and coffee bar, with a great selection of wines and snacks. This area alone is a great coffee shop / wine bar, so to have the cat area above it makes it one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh!

Oh, and of course, you have the option of adopting one of these cute little ones. A wonderful side effect of the colony is that you can be confident that all the occupants are friendly to other cats and people (and that they are all spayed/neutered/vaccinated). We fell in love with a particular little lady, completed the (straightforward) paperwork that evening, and several days late (after the necessary checks), we came by to pick her up! She's now settled-in at our home with our other cat, who quickly became her new best friend.

Though I brought home my own piece of the Colony, that is not going to stop me coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I came with my friend to drink wine & see kitties & we were told they were filled to maximum capacity (of 10 people) for the next hour and we couldn't see the cats.  Then at 2 when all 10 people left we asked if we could go up and see them and we were told it's cat nap time. As a Veterinary medicine student I can assure you that cats will nap whenever they want whether or not there are people present & two girls saying hi to the ones that are awake will not disturb them. Anyway...

The wine was good and so was the atmosphere but you could be a little more lenient with the cat policy especially if you're going to advertise yourself as a cat cafe. It would also make people more willing to come because although I liked the place & the idea of it I walked all the way there & didn't even get my kitty cat fix!!"}
{"text":"Beyond impressed with a private event held at Colony Cafe for Mother's Day. Excellent service, delicious brunch with mimosas, coffee, tea, and plenty of time with the adorable cats in the Cat Loft, all for $30 a person. I honestly would have paid double for the experience.

The owners, Sue and Erik, could not be kinder or more accommodating. While running around serving mimosas and brunch, they still found time to chat with everyone and made the day extremely enjoyable. Sue even took photos of each party, printed copies for each person, and put them in a special sleeve as a Mother's Day keepsake. What a thoughtful idea!

Definitely recommend visiting Colony Cafe, especially for special events. They fill up fast, but if you subscribe to their Newsletter (via the \"Contact Us\" tab on their website) or follow them on Facebook, you'll be the first to know about upcoming events. Thank you again, Sue & Erik!"}
{"text":"Hi my name is Lexi Wiater and I am seven years old. I went here with my dad and the people were very mean and they refused to let us stay, and no one else was even there. The lady at the desk (I don't know her name) was very mean to us. I cried because I wasn't allowed in and no one was there. As much as I love cats, I will never come here again! I was really looking forward to coming here too. Please treat your customers better, especially children! :-("}
{"text":"What is there not to like about coffee, wine, food and cats?! Incredible food. Great coffee. The cats are super friendly as are owners and staff."}
{"text":"This cafe (and its residents) are adorable! I made a reservation a few days in advance for an hour in the cat loft, but they do take walks in if they aren't filled to capacity. The cat loft is huge and cozy - lots of seating, half of which is taken up by cats taking a snooze! I love that you can bring up your beverage to relax and hang out with the kitties. I had a glass of wine, but definitely want to come back to try their coffee, tea, and food. The cats there all seem very happy and they were all incredibly friendly. I was so tempted to take one home with me! 

I will say that while we were there, there was only one other person so the cats all seemed much happier and relaxed. The group after us had almost ten people, a few of which were younger children, and it seemed like it was getting hectic/the cats were getting stressed out. So I would recommend coming here when there are less people if you can. I will surely be back to come play with more kitties!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I am sad to say this place disappoint me. I think the main reason is that I came in colony cafe with an expectation. First of all, you have to pay an extra fee to go to the cat room upstairs which is separate from the cafe. The cats aren't very friendly, one of them actually scratched my friend. The kittens are friendly and super cute though. There were other people in the cat room as well so we didn't get a lot of time with the kitten. We ended up not eating here, we just left. I thought we have to order food from them and can play with the cats while we are being served, but no you don't have to order anything. We were so hungry but the menu doesn't seem like they serve anything large portion enough to satisfy us. A lot of food I think I'll like if I'm just snacking. I think you have the option of ordering food and eat it in the cat room though."}
{"text":"After months of enviously scrolling through Instagram posts of cat cafes, I was SO excited when I learned Pittsburgh was opening one right around the corner from my house. I absolutely recommend this for all you cat lovers and even all you non-cat people like me. It's such a unique experience to not try it out.

As you first enter, you'll find their cafe area where you can come relax with a cup of coffee if you prefer to steer clear of the cats. For those with a reservation ($8), you're guided upstairs to the cat loft where all the cats roam. We booked the last time slot available for 7pm, so the suspense was building up the whole day. Since it was late, all the cats were clearly tired and not as energetic as they would be which was a bummer. Nonetheless, it was still a great experience. Some tried to be playful but then crawled back into bed after a few minutes. A valiant effort. 

They have a small menu of coffee, wines, and apps. Of course, it was completely overpriced. I paid $4 for a very small coffee. However, the staff were all so friendly. It was very impressive how they knew all the cats' names, ages, personalities, etc. All cats are available for adoption so it was tempting not to leave with 5 cats hanging out of my purse. 

As someone with a mild cat allergy, I was a bit nervous, but surprisingly, I did not have any reactions. The space is very well-kept, clean, and had no odor which is impressive for a room housing a dozen cats."}
{"text":"It is a no-brainer that I would be here the first day they open. I was SO stoked to have a cat cafe in Pittsburgh. I'd been to the one in Paris and while both are cat cafe's, they're totally different. The Paris cafe is a restaurant and cat cafe, but they don't have any regulations (that I know of), so the cats are all up in your grill/food. It was actually funny to me, but I could see why people might be grossed out. I totally get why there would be regulations here. In Paris, I was eating a salad while simultaneously petting a cat and smelling litter, so that last part wasn't very pleasant. This is a totally different experience, and a better one at that!

The first floor is the cafe, which includes a great espresso and wine bar! I do like the fact that you can get a to-go cup and bring it up the second floor and visit the cats. They also serve a light food menu. I tried some of their melts, which were really good. I imagine they'll probably be changing the menu as they're new and want to tweak things. I also think it's super cool they collaborated with Pittsburgh Winery and have their own special blend of wine! 

So the second floor is your kitty haven aka my heaven. There are 10-12 cats there that are all adoptable and adorable! Most are pretty social, which is done on purpose. So you're more than likely going to be petting, playing and pouncing (I should say the cats will be pouncing). I loved every second of my time there. They make it a cozy and comfy environment with lots of seating for you and toys for the cats to play with. 

Appointments are strongly suggested, as there is a limited number of people who can be up in the cat loft at one time. Makes total sense, since it's not that big. It's also $8 per hour, which I am MORE than happy to pay, because this money goes towards taking care of the cats. And, of course, the business has to make a little money to keep going too! 

Do yourself a favor and go here whenever you are having a bad day, because I'm sure it will make it a better one. Heck, even go on a good day, because it will make your day even more purrrrrfect!"}
{"text":"A must-go place if you're a cat lover. Plus, Make sure to book a reservation of the cat loft before you go there."}
{"text":"Very cool idea! Love the food and most of all, the cats!"}
{"text":"They have cats, need I say more....actually yelp wont let me leave a review this short, so I have too. I liked it, but go earlier in the day, all the cats were sleepy at 5pm when I went. Maybe go pet some cats then get brunch in the city."}
