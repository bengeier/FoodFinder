{"text":"This place has the warmest and most welconing ambiance ive seen in a while. The lighting is perfect for winding down and enjoying an afternoon tea or dinner. The lady who greeted me was very nice  and hospitable , her english was not very good but it wasn't a problem. I ordered the baran special tea and she brought out the most gorgeous and delicate china glass pot with loose leaf tea warming over a candle light. The tea cup and saucer itself was served with a cinnamon stick and rose bud with ginger rock sugar on the side, I felt like a princess! I did not try the food but my grandparents have (reserved brit immigrants) and they said the food was great! I'm deffinitely going to make a return in the future."}
{"text":"Delicious food but poor customer service. The person who took my order was grumpy and wouldn't allow any substitutions. There are at least 4 other places to get Persian food in this area. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Unbelievable meat and chicken BBQ! Out of this world!!! Highly recommend. Try their veal strip loin"}
