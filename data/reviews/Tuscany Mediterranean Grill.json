{"text":"This was a HORRIBLE place to eat. The food was the best part but that's not saying much.  The restaurant itself is a nasty 80's salmon pink hue with chandeliers trying to be something it's not.  It looks like it is, a hotel restaurant.  
First off, they screwed up our reservation.  They had us as a no show for 5 o'clock but we came in on time for our 8 o'clock reservations.  The place was only half empty and they acted as though they'd have to scramble to find us a table.  They finally sat us and didn't give us a menu until we asked.  We also had to ask for a drink menu.  We came for restaurant week so the menu was limited but it sounded so good (hence why we came).
The food was completely forgetable and generic.  Not worthy of the time, money or calories.  They also had run out of many items on the menu, which the waitress said \"This is our first restaurant week, and we didn't know what to expect.\"  I can't even remember what I ordered it was that bad and forgetable.  Will never come back."}
{"text":"We stopped in to have dinner here. I had to send my pizza back because it had incorrect ingredients on it, the second time it was missing ingredients. We were still charged for all the extra toppings. By the time I got my order the rest of the party was done eating. The chicken Parmesan marinara sauce was very bland. The decor is dated and the dim lighting does not hide that. I would skip this restaurant."}
{"text":"Not bad, but it wasn't great. I had the Tuscan Chicken and it was fine. I exepected better for the menu prices but I guess they have to make up for being a hotel restaurant. I was a patron of the hotel and was given a $5 entrée discount, that softened the blow a little, it almost covered the overpriced glass of Merlot."}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is beautiful and romantic- white tablecloth and candlelit. The servers are dressed professionally and look clean and put-together. It never seems to be too busy, so I love that. I've never had a wait or had a bad service experience. (Micah was our server, and he was awesome!)  I had the red snapper and it was probably the best fish I've EVER had. I definitely recommend it to others, and will be getting it again for sure. There's also a huge wine list, which I appreciate.  You can see the cooks preparing your meal from a tv screen, and I think that is pretty neat. Great place for date night."}
{"text":"I went on a Wednesday night.  The restaurant wasn't as full as one would expect for a week night, but I think a lot of that is due to the fact that you can't tell it's a restaurant just driving by.  It's attached to a hotel, and I think it might even technically be the hotel's restaurant, but MY GOODNESS was the food amazing.

I had the calamari and the paella.  My wife (vegetarian) had the ravioli.  And we both had the Flourless Chocolate Cake for dessert. The food was AMAZING!  I almost feel bad for whomever the chef is, that his food isn't more widely known because the restaurant's appearance is so unassuming-I mean we almost couldn't even figure out how to get in if not going through the hotel entrance.

I highly recommend it.

OH, and the bread!  Just the bread we had while waiting for our meals was ABSOLUTELY delicious as well.  EVERYTHING was great."}
{"text":"Good Value with exceptional server.  This is an Italian restaurant with a seafood emphasis.  Friday fish fry is quality and worth the trip.  My favorite dish is parmigiano encrusted tuna (always full of flavor and fresh).  Scallops are always well prepared (tender but  not chewy).  I tried their chicken parmigiano for the first time tonight and it was quality.  The sauce holds a full flavor with a hint if an edge which made it above the average Italian restaurant chicken parm.  

Salads....always fan of the wedge (not officially on the menu at the moment but can still get it at times) otherwise I go with the spinach which is a vinegar blend with,  goat cheese/pears/craisins.  

Service in the dining room is fantastic when you draw Betsy as your server.  As a repeat customer, I have seen her excellent memory, creativity, and proactive attention to the product she presents in action."}
{"text":"This was the best meal that we have had in a while! Our waitress was great:) And the food was amazing. New menu items are a very welcome addition. The Chef did an amazing job on the lamb, paella, pasta, everything. Thank you for a wonderful evening:)"}
{"text":"Service was horrible and food was just ok. The bread was the best part of the meal but it didn't come to the table until after the salads. It was a Friday night and there were maybe 10 tables of people.  The service was slow and the waiter blamed it on the kitchen being backed up.  Wonder what would happen if they were busy? The bus girl was fun to watch and bet on which table she would grab a glass from next.  Didn't seem like anyone had been trained or wanted to work there. Only went because I had a Bucky book coupon.  Will not make that mistake again."}
{"text":"We are hosting our daughter's wedding at the Tuscany, so we attended a tasting to preview the three dinner choices for the reception. Our first impression was that the views from the dining room are beautiful. It's open, welcoming and elegant, with windows all around providing a view of the Capital Springs State Recreation Area.  When the dinners arrived, they were beautifully arranged and delicious. We chose the salmon, pork loin and the chicken Marsala. We couldn't decide which one we loved the most. Their Master Chef, Peder, is so accommodating and talented. We wanted to change up the potatoes a little and he just went back to the kitchen and put together a couple more choices. He is a talented chef and willing to adjust or create anything you ask. We are lucky to have such a gifted chef in Fitchburg. We have also stopped by the bar area from time to time for \"bar food\" and happy hour, Peder is the magic behind these foods as well. We are seriously considering having our rehearsal dinner here. Their Event Planner, Jessica, is so welcoming and easy to work with, returns phone calls and e-mail quickly and never made us feel rushed.  We highly recommend stopping by the Tuscany for drinks and snacks or a delicious, memorable dinner."}
{"text":"First time at Tuscany. Like the atmosphere,loved the piano music. Our server was Betsey, she was wonderful and made our dining experience much more enjoyable.
The food was delicious, had the tomato bisque and tenderloin penne my wife had the Cesar salad. The bruschetta app was yummy as were our deserts.
We will be returning."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this restaurant because we had a coupon. It was a little difficult to find at first (had to walk up some stairs, then walk through the bar), but once we met the hostess, it was smooth sailing from there. I ordered the steak and was very pleased with it. We liked the atmosphere, the service was good, and we would go back again.

Update: Went back a second time with wife and kids, and it was fantastic. I had the salmon and it was amazing! I decided to give it 5 stars instead of 4."}
{"text":"We stopped in one night during the week and there were only 2 other tables with people.  Didn't change much during the rest of the meal so maybe they make it up on weekends.  Anyway, the service was quite adequate for us as the waitress gave us some time to decide on our meal and then quickly took the order.

The bread and olive oil that was served first was very good.  Our order of calamari was excellent!  I usually judge an Italian restaurant on how well they do calamari as its a touchy dish to get right.  Give them a 5 on that.  Plus it was not skimpy on the amount.

My wife got a steak and I got the lobster ravioli.  The steak was good but nothing to brag about.  My ravioli on the other hand was outstanding!  Nice chunks of lobster, a perfect cream sauce and 4 big pillows of wonderful hand made pasta!  

Didn't have desert but they have some nice dishes.

Overall, I'd come back to try some of their other stuff."}
{"text":"First time visit. We both had the prime rib ($16 for 8 oz, $19 for 12 oz, and $22 for 16 oz.). Dinner started with really good warm bread, butter/olive oil & garlic. Choice of soup or salad, we both had soup. Tomato parmeson and French Onion. They both were fantastic! Prime rib was tastefully seasoned and cooked to perfection. Have had a lot of prime rib in town and some taste too much like, well, like meat. This was really, really good. It came with hash browns and vegetables.

The whole place has nice ambience and the lounge is cozy and has happy hour appetizers from 4pm - 7pm. Overall good food, good service, and good prices. We're definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with mother and uncle. All three meals where all right but not amazing. The quality to price ratio was off (too expensive). My meal was ordinary with meatballs that where dry and over cooked. Wine was good."}
{"text":"I took the time to check this place out after a Groupon purchase. Spend $50 and face value of the Groupon was $100. 

Needless to say I was looking to spend at least $50.  Dinner for two people included drinks, appetizer, entrée, and dessert.

Since it was a special occasion plus the Groupon I felt more apt to be looking at the menu items rather than prices.  As far as price, it definitely was not inexpensive. They have a wide variety of chicken fish and steak.  I went for the gusto and got steak, which was done perfectly, absolutely zero complaints.  

Service was prompt, although it seemed odd to be practically the only table being served. Most other patrons were at the bar.  If they would've forgotten about us, I don't even think they would have been able to see us.  

All things considered, I would not hesitate to go back, maybe for happy hour sometime soon because it seemed inviting and fun.  Even with my $50 discount, it still seemed like a reasonable price for what we had."}
{"text":"We had a Christmas event catered at this restaurant and orders placed weeks ago. We were disappointed in the meals we received.

We had 3 meat options, steak, chicken and fish.

My table was fortunate to have someone who ordered each. The steak was medium rare for the gentleman who ordered The \"well done\", and the chicken was baked but still pink on the inside, and the fish though cooked completely was cold. The green beans were undercooked for all 6 tables. The mashed potatoes were good, though some plates didn't get the mashed potatoes(even though they were ordered for everyone). The gravy was delicious.

The organizers were able to get the meals together somehow. The space was lovely and enough for The event."}
{"text":"An Americanized-Italian restaurant in the suburb. It is connected to Fitchburg's Quality Inn. The location probably says it all about its (or lack of) character. 

Came here with a large group of friends and was lucky to get a chance to taste 10+ dishes. They were all good, but very standard. Nothing exciting or memorable. It lacks of charm. I also think it is slightly over-priced. 

If you live in Fitchburg, it could be a convenient neighborhood Italian place. Otherwise, I see no particular reason visiting this place."}
{"text":"Part one:

Absolutely horrible service, the food was mediocre.
The prime rib was tough, the hash browns were soggy so they were left untouched. As far as the price tags go, it was about right for the quality of the food BUT....service..... way under the fast food mark. Our server first blamed the bartender for losing our cocktail slip (mind you there were only 9 diners currently and a handful of patrons in the bar), fails to refill our waters. Upon receiving our tab, I waited 40 minutes for my server to bring back my card and payment slip. What blows me away after this.... I find out that my server fraudulently helped himself to a 15% gratuity on my card!!!!!! I left him a $0.00 tip for my experience there and he stole from me. The longer I waited, the more his tip decreased so he got what he deserved but I was in for a surprise in the end. I do not and WILL NOT recommend this place to anyone.

Part Two:

I spoke with 2 wonderful employees in regards to my experience there and kindly explained to me that their system has been designed to \"hold\" 15-20% automatically and that if no tip was left, the normal amount of the tab would be processed instead. I was in complete agreement with this. When I was asked \"How can we make this better?\", I decided to leave it up to them to find a suitable solution.

I just received a call from the Tuscany Grill today and thought there would be some sort of closure to this matter but instead, I got a very unprofessional Mr. Abdul, Tuscany Grill General Manager on the other line. Before we could talk, Mr. Abdul insisted that he needed to finish speaking before I could speak so I let Mr Abdul have the floor. Very angrily he expressed his opinion on this matter in short, he doesn't care if I don't like the food and that I shouldn't eat there again and they did not steal from me (mind you this review was in place BEFORE I spoke to anyone) and stated it might be the credit card companies doing.

When Mr. Abdul was finished, I stated that I did talk with 2 individuals from there and I understand what has happened but to Mr. Abdul, this was unacceptable and would not hear anything more, never the less, I never got to saying anything before Mr. Abdul abruptly stated that this conversation was over and hung up on me.

Very rude and unprofessional from one manager to another. Nothing has been rectified so my review will not change.

As a customer, I do expect to see the amount that I have signed in agreement to paying on my bank/credit card statement and also, I did expect more professionalism from Mr. Abdul.

I guess if this is Fitchburg's best kept secret...please do us all a favor and keep it a secret. I do not wish Mr. Abdul's communication on anyone..."}
{"text":"The restaurant smells like an assisted living facility. There is a huge dining room and only 3 tables are occupied at any given time, which shouldn't come as a surprise I guess. Service is slow. The menu seems overpriced, especially given the other  dining choices nearby."}
{"text":"Well let's see, the caesar salad, minus soggy croutons, and the drinks were fine but it stops there. Ordered pork tenderloin and steak diane. Suffice to say my well done steak diane was medium rare at best and the pork tenderloin was dry, dry, dry, so overcooked that even if they gave us a steak knife, it would have been tough to cut. First and ONLY time we will ever go to Tuscany, YUCK! One other point, restaurant was 2/3 empty and service was still slow."}
{"text":"Food was above average.  Service was horrible.  Apparently others knew this already as we were one of 2 tables in the entire restaurant.  Too many other good options in Madison to waste your time trying this hard to find place."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for restaurant week and LOVED it.  I had the calamari which was delicious for my app, the butternut squash ravoli which was AMAZING and the flourless chocolate cake for desert which was also delicious.  Great wine selection and loved the atmospher!!!  Our waitress was really great too!"}
{"text":"4 stars for previous visits which included 1:1 for lunch and dinner but they handled a large sorority function very well and I look back on that day + night with a lornful sigh because last night wasn't the best. 

Service = 0.5 stars. Yeah~ I know. 
We waited at the stand to pick up our call ahead to go order. The owner or manager guy came to ask had we been helped. At that point, we had been addressed. I don't know what took so long to pull together Red Snapper & the Saturday Prime Rib special but I figured it's 8p and every one is ready to go home. 

After reading the day's special at the hostess stand we then Decided to dine in so my Sorority sister could try the blackened Grouper. It was a production to \"find us seating\" although there were only 3 occupied tables. Being a former server; I figured - oh someone is about to get cut or it's all about rotating tables until the doors close. Well, whatever it was - service is atrocious. I do love the tv screens in the dining room allow you to see the ktichen cook & prep area. 

The service is a hit/miss situation. Things are brought out of sequence if they're brought at all. I have learned to pay attention to the service in the area (that I didn't notice much before) but people love to ask \"if you want a refill\" I'm perplexed by this as a server - you drink is half full ..guess what... I'm bringing over more. I had the joy of learning from one dining patron to never take his glass so that made me work to bring refills to the table and top off every glass. 

Food:
The scallops were cooked to the temp requested. But capers where everywhere. No mention of capers. I hate capers. Easy enough to pick off. Green beans and mashed potatoes were the sides - no other options. The potatoes came hardened over that folks thought I had a biscuit and wanted one. That aside, nothing to write home about. No flavor. The menu says priscuitto wrapped but Idk. 

Rosemary bread & multigrain are brought over with butter and raosted garlic in olive oil. 

The grouper wasn't ordered because Mahi Mahi special was chosen since it came with risotto. She wanted risotto with the grouper but I told her no changes as it may cause problems for all of us. 

The Wedge salad is deconstructed AND I LIKE THAT. 
Soup options were not alluring last night. 
The reduction sauce drizzled over the green beans was nice but the veg wasn't anything exciting. 

I hate saying hotel food is blah as I like the Wise & Cap Chophouse but when I travel - I do avoid hotel food for  a reason. 

I appreciate Tuscany being another Sorority sister's favorite place so maybe that's why I've been treated well in her grouping. This wasn't get me the manager bad but when a place is empty you can't help but notice when service is lacking. 

Our server was more excited about the Disney themed card that was being use (and it is cute) than the food she served us. 

I guess that's how they all feel: ambivalent"}
{"text":"I am usually skeptical of hotel food. This place didn't disappoint. Food was over priced, food was burnt, I have found better quality under a Kwik Trip heat lamp."}
{"text":"We stopped for their HH. Their HH is 1/2 off appetizers. No drink specials during HH. We had the filet mignon kabobs and the tuna piccata. The tuna was cooked deliciously. The capers and salsa were a nice addition. The crostini provided a crunchy garlic side note. The filet was tasty with plenty of flavor. The 4 stars come from the texture of the filet. It was not quite fork cut tender. Good flavor but was a bit tough. My Moscow mule was not too strong either. All in all, we had 3 cocktails, 1 Guinness and 2 apps. Total was around $42. Not bad!"}
{"text":"Tuscany has great staff and amazing food. The seafood linguine is the best I've ever had period!!!  Generous drinks beautiful spot...  It's Fitchburg's hidden gem. Available for private parties also"}
{"text":"The food was good but overpriced. I ordered a whisky sour, which was terrible, but I wasn't too upset as I had a free drink coupon. I was staying in the hotel so it was very convenient but I'll venture elsewhere next time I stay there."}
{"text":"The service was good, the decor was nice,  the food presentation was well done.  The food was good, but when I see prices in this range, I am expecting great.  I'm not saying the food is bad, but the quality of the food does not match the cost.  If the prices were lower, I would probably give this place 4 stars, but I know there are better restaurants in Madison at this price point."}
