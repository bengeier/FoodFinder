{"text":"Food - 2 stars.  Having a beer and kid friendly - 3 stars.  I will come here again because it's local, a good space, very kid friendly, AND they have Beau's on tap, but the food was definitely less than stellar.  Mussels were shrivelled (probably cooked from frozen) and our fettucine was dripping with oil.  Next time i'll try the pizza, and maybe have better luck."}
{"text":"I've been to Desotos about 5 times in the past couple of years, and each time I go I am impressed with the level of service and quality of food that we get. This is my first time reviewing them, and it was definitely the best of the best tonight. Our server, Morena, was very friendly, attentive and personable. Our food and drink arrived in record time: our beer was cold, and our food hot! I tried the pizza for the first time, and I went with the Margherita con prosciutto. Delicious! Lovely thin crust, with a delight of cheese and salty cured meat adorning the top. I've always been a fan of everything I've ever ordered from Desotos, but I am now a convert of their pizza. Mangia!"}
{"text":"I was there for a Tuesday dinner with a friend and we shared a large and delicious kale salad. I ordered the chicken supreme and my friend had the fish. The veggies were well seasoned and perfect. Both entrees were delicious and fresh. We both loved out meals and our server was excellent. I especially appreciated that how patient she was while I was dithering over my beer choices and even allowed me to sample before ordering. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been twice. Great patio, great service, great beer selection. Had their standard beef burger the first time. Wasn't impressed. It was quite dry and not very flavourful. Not terrible, but not worth the price. The fries were pretty good though.  The second time I went I had the veggie burger. So yummy! It's not a fake meat pattie, it's made with beans, lentils, veggies, etc. They do need to switch up the buns though. Way too big and way too dry.  The sangria is great. Seems like they actually have a recipe they follow, as opposed to just throwing a bunch of whatever into some wine, which I what a lot of places do."}
{"text":"This is my partner and i's go to place in corso Italia. Consistently good food for a fair price. We love the calamari and my partner loves the breaded chicken (although they often don't have it). The specials are always great, and the servers are friendly."}
{"text":"We wanted to go across the road to Emma country kitchen but it was packed so we came over to Desoto.  The place was just starting to serve brunch and the little jazz band started playing(Sundays 11 to 2pm). The food was basic brunch, nothing fancy but simple home cooked food.  The atmosphere is great, very family friendly and the service was awesome.  Will come here again for sure."}
{"text":"Favourite pub! Food is a bit of a crap shoot but I have been served many more good dishes than bad. Oysters are awesome. Beer selection is awesome."}
{"text":"Great freaking place! Prices are very reasonable and service was great.  Servers know the food and know their beer on tap.   I had muscles, they were fresh and flavorful. My buddy had a pizza with onion rings, great batter and dip for the onion rings.  Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"I Love Desotos. Great food and fantastic staff. It is Family friendly and conformable."}
{"text":"The reason I am giving my experience at DeSotos 3 stars instead of 1 star is because the food is averagely good and the the servers I had on my last two visits were lovely. What was not a good experience was the lack of hospitality and customer service provided by the general manager Michelle. It is clear to me that the servers are afraid of her and I can see why.   On one recent visit she refused to make me a Margherita with premium tequila because they had run out of the bar rail tequila. She was inflexible and made no effort to provide options, including charging a little more for a drink made with premium liquor. At another dinner she again took over from the server to explain that if you order a drink you have to pay for it even if it tastes insipid which it did. After her admonishment and finger wagging she agreed to take the two $6 cocktails off the bill... this time!   As someone who works in the restaurant industry I am shocked by her lack of understanding of what it means to deliver even average customer service. Treating staff and customers like children isn't it. Speaking harshly with a fake smile on your face isn't it. Instead, making sure that people feel respected and taken care of is what keeps staff and customers happy and coming back. I live in the neighbourhood and will not recommend or return to DeSotos as long as the leadership remains the same. There are too many better restaurants on St. Clair to choose from that know how to treat their customers right."}
{"text":"Food was average (brunch menu). Service was poor (negative attitude, slow). Seemed that the other servers were more upbeat. Maybe we picked the wrong day."}
{"text":"was there last nite..... cool place. great bar with cool feel. food was really good as well.   regret that I did not go there earlier"}
{"text":"I frequent DeSotos often. I have brought many friends and family here as well. The staff are always great and approachable. The menu is small but everything on it is fabulous. There are daily specials which cater to every taste. The soups are great. The salads are delightful. The main courses are incredible. The portobello burger is to die for. The micro- brewed beers are and excellent add on to a great meal. Coffees and desserts are always yummy too. Thursday night jazz night is something to hear as well as sing in if that's your thing. Its a great little neighbourhood place where  being a regular of is a good thing."}
{"text":"- My boyfriend and I decided to go here for brunch because we have never tried it and we've lived right around the corner for 4 years. He got the two egg breakfast, which I would be embarrassed to serve in any establishment. The poached eggs were decent, slightly under cooked. Homefries had a non-existent seasoning on them. The bacon overcooked and crumbled when pierced with a fork. The sausage was straight out of a sysco or gfs box, you be the judge. And the two uncuttable slices of day old baguette are a poor excuse for breakfast bread. Now with my chicken Caesar salad, you have to think hard to fuck up right? But when you charge $14 for it, it has to be good or else your begging for a review such as this. The chicken was dried out like it had been re-heated from the day before and tasted like it had been kissed with carbon, not good. The Lettuce was yellow and not uniform whatsoever, bacon was non-existent, croutons were slices of the same inedible baguette served with my breakfast. There was nothing \"market fresh\" about this meal. However the spicy Caesar we had with breakfast was standard. So if you're on St.Clair West and looking for a marginal at best spicy Caesar go to De Soto's, but if you're looking for an edible meal I suggest you go anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"Visiting from California and it was a few days before our departure. Dined on the patio, relatively late, with my wife and two younger daughters. Service was excellent and food was superb. It was so nice to take our time with the meal, chat and do a little people watching. Highly recommend that you visit."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Thursday night to this great little local and not only was the menu fantastic for pub but there was a delightful little open mic where veteran jazz musicians were playing.  Lovely.  I look forward to many more visits."}
{"text":"Would never eat in this restaurant. The mouse & rat problem  in this place is out of control. Saw the rodents with my own eyes. Disgusting !!!"}
{"text":"Visited this place a couple times when I went to Toronto - once for dinner & once for brunch. Bottom line: I like it.  The decor is reminiscent of a family restaurant with pieces of personal memorabilia thrown around, and candle wax droppings collecting around the ancient holders. The staff was friendly, and the manager made the rounds talking to everyone, making them feel welcomed. There's a definite family vibe here.  The food was good. The sweet potato fries with a chipotle aioli was a great starter. I especially liked the grilled calamari, cooked to a perfect consistency, and nicely flavored with roasted garlic. For brunch, I had the eggs benedict with their homemade Hollandaise sauce which I enjoyed tremendously. They also get extra kudos for their cappuccino, which nicely capped off my meals.  The restaurant was a little far from downtown. The only reason I even know about it was through a friend's recommendation. But if you're in Toronto, I'd recommend you make the little effort and visit this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this place quite often. We live nearby and when we moved to the St. Clair neighbourhood discovered this place and have brought many friends here. The atmosphere is relaxed and the food is fresh and fantastic! They have fresh oysters which we love to order. Various mussel dishes with great wine based or curry broth. The other night I ordered the rack of lamb and it cooked to perfection. They also offer burgers and nachos etc. They make a mean Ceasar which I love to drink too. Over all a good place to bring friends and family."}
{"text":"Desotos is a great neighbourhood joint that has decent food but it's location and friendly vibe are really what make it worth going.  It does kind of feel like a restaurant run by people who don't know much about healthy eating, though.  Lots of aioli, lots of fried things, not so much on the vegetables though the spinach salad is delicious, it's one of the only healthy options on the menu.  The Caesar, made without garlic (?!) is like a crime against humanity.  Kids meals are cheap and pretty good; homemade pizza to order is a big hit; we also really like the sliders and the chicken sandwich.  Pizzas are good, burgers - meh.  Do not - I repeat do NOT be tricked into ordering the sweet potato \"frites\".  They are giant, quarter-potato wedges and really not worth the calories. Their selection of beers is pretty good, too if you're into micro brews."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm just writing a review for this place now. I've been coming here for years and I just love everything about this place. The food is fabulous. I highly recommend the grilled calamari with anchovies and capers. Divine! If that's not your cup of tea the burgers are always a hit as well as the thin crust gourmet pizzas. The Magic Mushroom with Gorgonzola cheese is too good to share. Also equally fantastic are the mussels and fresh PEI oysters at a great price.  On tap is local craft brew which rotate periodically.  With all of the recent upgrades to the outdoor patios (yes two) with the addition of a built in bench, string lights, canopy and comfy cushions this place is a summer must!!!  The staff are really amazing and see way too much of me and Tony, the restauranteur extraordinaire, is always around with a smile and greeting his guests who are more like family. I love to see such a fantastic and fun restaurant/ lounge in my neighbourhood.  Final note: the Open Mic Thursdays are really, really fun!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place right in the middle of Toronto's Italian district. Great choice of dishes including fish and chips to die for. Great service too. Reasonable prices especially given the huge portions!"}
{"text":"Our go-to brunch spot!  The fire-grilled PITA & HUMMUS is smoky and addictive.  EGGS FLORENTINE: perfect every time with runny yolks and creamy hollandaise.  STEAK & EGGS: satisfying cut of striploin that comes out cooked exactly the way you order it (almost every time).  Fresh oysters, prosecco, mimosas and an extensive list of Brickhouse brews and ciders.  Coffee is good, and they have organic green tea.  Service is usually good (better if you arrive early before things get really busy) and the staff are *always* friendly!  Love this place!  *Updated review from 4 to 5* as we've been coming here for   nearly a year with consistently delicious food and friendly service. They changed chef last year and we noticed a dramatic difference in quality of food!!"}
{"text":"Living in the St. Clair W. area I've passed by De Sotos a few times and have been curious enough to put the place on my 'To Do' list. Having seen a sign out front the establishment advertising weekend Brunch I decided to head down this past Saturday just after noon to sample their fares.  De Sotos is a very comfortable establishment to eat and/or drink in. It has a warm restro-pub feel to it. I can easily see it as a good neighborhood hang out spot. It is much classier than the many whole-in-the-wall establishments heading east toward Oakwood and yet is not as expensive as some of the Italian restaurants near Dufferin.    For brunch I was looking at eating something unique to the establishment, like their Stirred Eggs Helene (2 eggs over easy baked with a ragout of tomato, bacon and mushroom, topped with pesto served with toast), however the waiter recommended the Eggs Benedict as being freshly made and a favorite of the clientèle. Benny it is then.  The food arrived, timely, just as the jazz duo started their second set. Oh, I forgot to mention, this was a \"Jazz Brunch.\" I can't imagine any more of a creature comfort than eating brunch in a warm establishment with live Jazz playing. Delightful. Seriously, bring a date.  The food was good. In fact I found the Eggs Benny to be one of the better in Toronto. The hollandaise sauce was perfect and noticeably homemade. Perhaps my only small disappointment was that the home-fried potatoes were pealed and blanched in a fryer before being pan fried to order. It seemed to me that with a well made Benny, with fresh hollandaise sauce, should be accompanied by baked potatoes that are then cut and pan fried in herbs and olive oil. I actually recommended this to the waiter who was serving me whilst trying not to be a food snob or risk a visit from an angry, butcher knife wielding cook. \"Just a suggestion.\" I said with a smile while feeling guilty about being a food critic.   Most definitely I will be back for Brunch again, as well as for dinner and/or late night drinks when the mood strikes me. I'm glad to have discovered the place and anticipate it being a local haunt. So far my experience is positive, De Sotos is a warm and friendly establishment with good food and service."}
{"text":"I live nearby so I've been walking past DeSotos for a while now, and finally decided yesterday to give it a try.  We ate outside on their sidewalk patio since they definitely have the best one in the Dufferin/St-Clair area. We had the thai chicken wings as a starter to share.  I would say that they were good. A bit too saucy, but that's nothing to complain about.  I then had the \"home\" burger, which was the most basic hamburger (I like to keep it simple).  It was garnished with some avocado bruschetta (AMAZING) and lettuce.  The beef was really good, but the bun was a bit dry.  It also came with the biggest pile of fries I ever got a restaurant.  They were so good- thinly sliced, crispy and salty.  Just the way I like them.   I would give the food a 4/5 stars but the service bumps it up to a 5-star rating.  Our waitress was so friendly and checked up on us just the right amount of times.  I would definitely come back here again to eat. Maybe inside this time since the restaurant looked very cozy and a bit classier than most of the restaurants around."}
{"text":"I spend a lot of time at DeSotos, especially during the summer (they have a lovely patio) and it's a solid pub with a great craft beer selection and friendly staff. Charming vibe with live jazz during brunch (get the eggs benny), this place is also kid-friendly for parents who may want to go out for a meal with their kids at some place not a chain/fast food restaurant.  I have also tried almost everything on the menu and have found very few \"misses\" (though there is one pizza with cold ham on top the should be avoided - get the sliders instead! They're awesome.) I don't eat oysters but have been told by folks who do that the ones at DeSotos are superior.  Very worthy of regular visits."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of the place, cozy. Friendly people and a good menu selection. Live jazz on Thursday night is great. Wine selection is ok but could be improved."}
{"text":"Pub typiquement canadien servant une grande variété de burgers et sandwichs. Les burgers au cheddar sont à tomber accompagnés de frites et d'un bon coca. Service rapide et aimable, les serveuses vous proposeront les 3 plats du jour. En début de soirée un orchestre live de jazz vient installer une atmosphère apaisante et posée pour décompresser après une dure journée de boulot."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. Great service. Cannot go wrong with any of their mussels. Fresh and tasty. The philly cheese steak sandwich is delicious. Great wine and beer list."}
{"text":"This review is just for the bar and not for food.   Came here on Sunday to enjoy the unseasonably warm weather. Nice list of Ontario craft beers on tap including Nickelbooks Scadanvian ale. Quite fruity.  Service was good and the place was quite busy."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic, they have a really nice patio, and the service is always good. Love it!"}
{"text":"We went again for a lovely Sunday brunch, with live jazz, today at De Soto's. The music was good - not too loud, but gentle classics - and the food was fabulous. My wife had the stirred eggs, which was excellent, while I had the steak & eggs - always a treat! Of course, the coffee was hot and strong, and kept that way through the meal by the superb staff. Finishing with a Mason jar of homemade carrot cake (what a neat idea!), we left greatly satisfied. A great start to spring!"}
{"text":"Wanted to satisfy an eggs Benny craving, with a bonus side of jazz during their Sunday brunch.  Don't come hungry...food takes the better part of an hour to arrive.  And then, not hot, tastes ok, not more .  If I return I'll go back to the shirred eggs I've enjoyed before as a more unusual brunch dish. Appreciated the Americano coffee.   Music 5 star. Food and service 3 star."}
{"text":"What the... why have I not reviewed this place yet?  This is my Hubster's and my main spot. We come here all the time for drinks, dinner and wings! They don't really specialize in wings (only two sauces and only one size) but they are absolutely fantastic every single time.  Oddly enough, we also get non-wing food sometimes. Right now I can't remember the other items I've had, but they've all been very good. The one that stands out is the charred rapini and spinach. It's a great way to get your veggies and it's really really good.  Service is always incredibly friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed and dark, perfect for a casual date night."}
{"text":"Best pub on St Clair West.  Good craft beers, good food.  Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but not worth a 2 hour on a not busy night.  Server brought me the wrong beverage and upon request to get my drink corrected the server was unpleasant and unresponsive. After this, we are still waiting upon a full hour, and all we have ordered is burgers and pizza.   Very unimpressed."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give it a 3 star.  After a gruelling practice with my softball team on Sunday, our captain suggested we come here for post practice bites and drinks because this is her go to place.  DeSotos has a variety of burgers, pizzas, pastas and other entrees, as well as daily specials. I was thinking a burger was appropriate, but then my captain mentioned fried chicken. I didn't actually look at the menu properly and totally missed the fried chicken part of the menu. Now I just had to have it. It comes with a side of fries, but unfortunately, it was lent and I had given up potatoes. There's no free substitute, despite telling the server I \"can't\" have potatoes, not even for a simple green salad. The charge was $3 for a simple substitute for a salad or onion rings. Minus half star.  My fried chicken was decent, and there were 6 onion rings, I remember because after trading food with friends, I had 2 onion rings left for myself. A friend had a salad, taste was pretty good and was a decent size.   Another friend had a craving for mushrooms, so she picked a pizza that had mushrooms on it, but when it came, it definitely lacked mushrooms. When she asked a server about whether there's actually mushrooms on the pizza, she pointed at something that may have looked like a mushroom, but that was only one on the entire pizza. Minus half star.  I guess it's not too bad for a restaurant that would have something for everyone, I'll probably come back here again, seeing as our team doesn't play too far from here."}
{"text":"This has to be the best semi-gastropub in the St Clair W area. It is definitely more of a pub but I throw gastro in there because they have a) excellent pizzas (possibly with homemade crust) b) various craft and microbrews and c) really good yam fries. I love yam fries.  The service is good and the place is never packed to the point that there is nowhere to sit. Is this because people don't know about it yet? They also have a piano for \"jazz brunch\" on weekends. AND tvs that play a range of sporting events, if you're into that kind of thing...  Finally, the building stands out with its bright red trim and old fashioned signage. Nice touch.  Loses a star for location ONLY because it is quite far west on the St Clair streetcar and not exactly surrounded by other options....but so great in so many other ways!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I had dinner here on Sunday January the 8th and spent almost $250 but it was well worth it. The grilled calamari was out of this world, and the pesto chicken spaghetti was amazing. Our server was fantastic, however the hostess that greeted us and seated us had a real bad attitude problem. If the food wasn't so good I would never go back based on the hostess that acted as though we were troubling her to seat us. Miserable with no cheer. She also had staring problems throughout our meal. However the food was so good, and our server was so sweet, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I like having this in the 'hood. Nice patio when the weather is nice and full bar selection. Food can be hit or miss though. I've only been for dinners and have been hopeful yet underwhelmed whenever I received my order. I'll still come back because it's a decent local place within walking distance."}
{"text":"One of those places that you go in after walking for so long. The food was meh i had a banquet burger, but the customer service we got was horrible. I'm one of those customers that goes in orders fast eats fast and wants to pay just as fast but nope."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, in 2008-2009, I worked here. Some may say writing a review for a place I used to work for is biased but biased or not, I challenge someone to find a better hollandaise than this place! Best brunch I've had in Toronto. Period. It's not pretentious, it's decently priced and the staff knows how to make a proper cappuccino which let's be honest, can make or break a dining experience. As far as dinner goes, I recommend the grilled calamari doused in heated olive oil and balsamic, with anchovies, roasted garlic, capers, red peppers and olives,  yam fries with chipotle aioli (this aioli makes just about anything taste good!) and traditional margherita pizza.  Even though I don't work here anymore and I no longer get an employee discount, I go back regularly with friends and family to eat. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and stumbled upon this little gem. Great atmosphere, patio is cozy and staff are very friendly. Most of all the food was amazing!  Just might have to make be his my go to stop."}
{"text":"We went there for a Sunday brunch. Food and service were pretty good but the environment was amazing! We say out in the patio. They had live jazz playing and the weather was nice. All in all it was a great experience and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I figure a brunch place that doesn't always have a 30+ minute wait for a table deserves at least 4 stars, right? But actually, this place does deserve a good rating. I wouldn't rave about it, but the food is good and comes out pretty quick, and there's been live jazz the couple of times I've been here. Overall, just a really enjoyable experience.   Not vegan-friendly, but fine for vegetarians (I can personally vouch for the eggs Florentine and my dad seemed really happy with his French toast). Oh and it's a good place to bring kids - they have crayons :)"}
{"text":"We recently tried Desotos and overall, it was pretty good.  Service was very friendly and accommodating.  In our group, we had a variety of dishes including pizza, pasta, burgers, wings and mussels.  All the food was excellent.  Their beer selection is all crafty type beers which didn't fly well with the guys.  If they had regular beer (even a small selection!), I think we would have stayed longer.  One guy in our group said the craft beer tasted like dandelions and grass - yum!  It's too bad because other than the beer situation, we quite enjoyed Desotos... it's walking distance from our house, has good food and a nice atmosphere.  I found the prices a little high (to be blunt - I paid the bill and it was $250 for 7 people, 3 of those were kids).  Unfortunately, we probably won't return because even days later, the guys were lamenting the beer selection, lol!  I guess I would be the same if the wine was not to my liking - the enjoyment of your beverage, especially the first beverage on a Friday night after work, is just as important as the food and service!"}
{"text":"I have been going to De Sotos for a few years (my how the time flies) now.  In the summer the patio is great having been expanded last year and improved with benches and an more cover this year.  All year round the inside is a relaxing feel with jazz, Sinatra or other low key music playing.  The staff are generally quite good and very friendly.  The food can be inconsistent but is usually quite good, especially for the price and they are very accommodating of special requests.  the beer selection is satisfying.  If you live in the area and are looking for a relaxing place to hang out or grab a bite to eat.  This is one of the best spots."}
{"text":"Loved it here. My favourite ratio of nice-to-casual. The food, lighting, atmosphere, attention to detail, and professionalism all felt high-end, but it was relaxed, fun, and unpretentious.  The restaurant is dimly lit and smells wonderfully. The menus are well-written and descriptive, the washrooms are immaculate and spacious, and the decor is whimsical without being tacky. Our lovely server and busser were trusted by management to dress neatly, stylishly, and casually, while not being made to wear an insulting uniform. I always appreciate this.  I should mention that the place was rammed full of people having fun. In the yelp survey I rated DeSotos as \"loud\", not because they were blaring music, but because it was full of people enjoying lively conversation.  I had made a lame pun earlier as we were leaving the house that since it was a date night, we should eat figs to be rebellious. What was the first thing I saw on the specials menu? Two figs, stuffed with Gorgonzola cheese and wrapped in prosciutto, plated beautifully and tasting like heaven. We enjoyed them as we perused the menu. They were a thoughtful blend of sweet and salty, which seems to be a theme at DeSotos.   For appetizers we got the baby arugula salad and an order of chicken wings. The aforementioned penchant for sweet and salty was executed nicely in both dishes. The wings were large and cooked perfectly, the salad was also large and somehow managed to be complex while being comprised of few ingredients. For entrees, my wife ordered a burger with frites and I had the seafood stew. I have never seen such beautiful colour on a burger patty. The stew was tomato based and huge, with cod, prawns, mussels, and squid, served in a ceramic pot with garlic bread. Everything was delicious.   This is the perfect date spot, not for people who are trying to impress each other, but for people who want to enjoy each other's company. It has the feel of a restaurant that someone daydreamed about for a long time before making a reality. This is a perfect place, and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I was a bit worried before we arrived at De Soto's for brunch after reading some negative reviews, but we had a great experience.  The food was great.  No line up.  Their take on Mimosa's was delicious.  Service was intelligent, friendly and professional.  Only complaint would be that it was a bit chilly inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"I travel to Toronto at least once a month, and each time I attempt to include a Thursday night at Desotos in the trip.  The management, the employees, the food and the music are just perfect.   I feel like a beloved local every time I step into this place.  BTW - I usually write scathing reviews here on Yelp.   Rarely do I ever give an establishment 5 stars.    Desotos deserves it."}
{"text":"Gave this spot a 3rd chance !!!  I really like the look and atmosphere of this little gem but service lacks 100 percent....    I'm not here to write lies or bs!  But here's goes  Ok so first I will tell you the food is great. That's what kept me coming back. Drinks are good and very nice outdoor eating area in the warm summer day!   Service service service is the worst I've ever had in my life. No friendly greeting no smiles no warm welcome. Almost seems like the wait staff is mad you're coming in the door like they need to do work !  Maybe these girls are working for paycheque not understanding that servers make money from tips! Tips come from guest who had good service. Slow isn't the word more like snails ! unhappy ,rude ,no idea of the meaning of hospitality. I've worked in the industry for 18 years. I can tell you I've made a lot of money in my will to work product knowledge and my ability to keep guest feeling like they're getting the guest experience they deserve and pay for. Eating out is a privilege for some and not everyone has the money to do so. I have to say I'm writing this to help you improve not to cut you up. I love this spot please who ever reads this it's easier to smile then be angry it's easier to treat ppl with respect then without. If you don't understand the world of hospitality there's lots of grocery stores who girls could work at. Worst service lazy and rude !"}
{"text":"Gone here off and on (mostly off) for about four years.  Friendly place for a pint but the food is not good.  I don't know if there is new ownership/management but there is definitely new staff and its an improvement.  Their menu has not changed in at least four years or so... I feel they would benefit if they totally overhauled the menu and started from scratch.  Having said all that, the place is often packed so I guess they know their customers."}
{"text":"This is our local, and is amazing in most ways. The patio is the best on St. Clair, the staff is super friendly, and the interior is pretty cool. Knocked one star off b/c the food and cocktails aren't the best I've had, but I'd bump them to 4.5 easily if I could."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices, and super kid friendly!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and have been having a hard time, as a young person of discerning taste, finding a bar that's not populated by old men. I was looking for a local haunt not another low-rent (read: vinyl banner for a sign, and that's the thing you invested the most money in) sports bar.   On a very bitter snowy/rainy night, looking for a beer to unwind with I popped in. I think I've found my \"local\". The women who served us was darling. Great to chat with, attentive and kind. Happy to see Beau's on tap. We only stayed long enough to split a plate of fries, but the dip was great, as were the fries. The menu looked like it would be worth going back for. Even with the negative reviews I'll be heading back to dive in deeper."}
{"text":"Been going here ever since we moved into the neighbourhood a year and half ago and have had nothing but great experiences with food, staff and the owner. The patio is lovely during nice weather and the inside has a nice local gastro-pub feel. I've taken friends, family and my little kids and they too have had great experiences. Staff have always been happy to accommodate the little ones. Pizzas are fantastic, grilled octopus just great and some delicious pasta dishes - it's Mediterranean/Italian fusion.  Something special I feel is that DeSotos has been around for years and it's not a two year hit wonder that's obnoxiously soon going to fail - it's stood the test of time and from what I've been reading it's also dealt with some reviewers with seriously large pickles up in some unique places. (*Read people pissed off because they heard happy birthday being sung to adults and many more not worth mentioning) :-)"}
{"text":"Man oh man. It very rarely happens, but the star rating for De Sotos led myself and my dining companion, the rarely amused Kent P, astray.   Cute patio, casual atmosphere and a full bar had us hopeful. The \"gastro house\" menu was appealing enough and I started with a french onion soup and moved on to the fettuccini. Fatty order, I know. It's how I roll on a chilly fall evening. They were both edible, but the soup was too sweet and the pasta was a bland. KP's pizza was pretty much a disaster with what appeared to be cold lunch meet sitting atop an sub-par 'za The kicker? We had zero alcohol and our bill came to $50.   PEPPER POINTS for the music.

{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch. There's live jazz (only for Sunday brunch) and a patio area. I had the home burger with cheddar and bacon. The bun was dry and a bit hard but the patty was juicy. The fries was crispy and delicious."}
{"text":"It was a long time I hadn't have a fish & chips. Pretty simple, pretty straight forward... how can you mess that up, right? When it came to the table I was in fact quite impressed, looked good and a bit upscale (well... its not wrap in newspaper as they use to do in England, right? _was so yummy then_). And then I took a bite in it... Oh... you know how smells and taste trigger memories? My grandma used ammonia to clean sometimes, can't forget that smell, and wont forget the cod at DeSotos brought that memory straight back from the past either!"}
