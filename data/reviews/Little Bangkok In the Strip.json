{"text":"Our new kick is Thai food, I had just purchased some tamarind paste at the Lotus Food Co. [another great place to stop and shop] to make something at home when we saw this little gem. Listen, this place has great food, it was fresh, seasoned just right and the staff get an enthusiastic double thumbs up for hospitality. We all tried something different, the service was quick and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Lunch takeout.  The worst Thai food I've ever had.  None of the vegetables tasted fresh, the rice was overly wet/soupy.  Was more like the crappy Chinese food you get at the mall food court, just with Thai spices dumped on top. I would not recommend this to anyone.  I rarely write reviews for anything but this was so bad I felt compelled. There are WAY better Thai restaurants in town, don't waste your time with this one.

The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of one is because it was technically edible."}
{"text":"I am still waiting for my thai food. I have been here for 45 minutes and only had the soup. The staff is lacking personality
 bordering on rude and the staffing to handle the lunch rush of a December Monday is ludicrous."}
{"text":"Don't buy the Groupon - they won't honor it. Delicious food at a great value. They ask for the spice level on a scale from 1-10. I didn't think the 5 was spicy. Great vegan (tofu) options. Don't let the small store front fool you. Big flavor and great service."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food Pittsburgh has to offer!  Everything is so authentic and you can taste the difference between their food and other cheapened versions being offered in the downtown area.  It is worth traveling the few extra minutes to grab lunch if you work downtown and a definite stop if you are shopping down in the Strip District!"}
{"text":"Trust me, this restaurant is amazing. Please try here and you will see what I meant. 
Reasonable price, great food and customer service.If you like spicy food, here is the best for you!!"}
{"text":"So-so Thai restaurant, nothing to get too excited about.  The soup was pretty good but my tofu pad thai was a little to sweet.  I would go back here, but it's not the best I've had."}
{"text":"The Tom Kha was thick and syrupy instead of light and citrusy and my food was so peppery that I could barely eat it."}
{"text":"Amazing food, I do a lot of traveling and this is hands down the best Thai food I've had in the states! 

It's a family owned business and the food here is really spot on. Fair warning though, it is way spicier than typical spice scales. A 5/10 is brutal, so always ask for less spice than usual, you can always add more spice.

The tom kha is absolutely amazing, so is the pad kra tiem. I go here all the time and I've never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Their drunken noodles are to die for!  It's truly the best in pittsburgh.  My boyfriend and I always ordered those noodles and they're consistently delicious every time.  Love the exposed brick, decor, and thai music.  Service was always, ALWAYS exceptional.  We live in boston now and we truly miss Little Bangkok."}
{"text":"Food: Little Bangkok has two separate menus online; the standard menu and the vegan menu.  Unfortunately, when a group of 8 of us went, 3 of us intending to order vegan, we were told that over half of the items on the online vegan menu were not actually vegan.  Multiple order requests were shot down for not being vegan and being made with egg or fish sauce.  Even the curry dishes, which at most Pittsburgh Thai restaurants are vegetarian/vegan friendly, were not.  Menu items are ordered on the 1-10 spicy scale.  We split the fresh summer rolls, which were huge and tasty.  Rather than being served as an entire roll, they were cut into individual pieces, like sushi, making it much easier to eat as a group.  No soups were vegetarian friendly.  The non-vegetarian eaters in our party seemed to enjoy the crab wonton, but said they had tasted better in the city.  The Pad Eee Eil was very bland and lacked flavor both at low spicy levels and high.  The sweet and sour was considerably more tasty than the Pad Eee Eil but was not as good as variations from other Pittsburgh Thai restaurants.  The meat eaters in the group seemed to enjoy the green curry and other dishes, but no one was blown away by their meal.    

Price: Most appetizers are $6 or less, soup ranges from $5-7 per bowl with hot pot option available, and entrees range from $10-15.  The prices are very reasonable.

Drinks: BYOB. There are fees for wine and beer.

Atmosphere: The dining room is very modestly decorated and wide open.  Tables can accommodate small and large parties.  We arrived around 7 on a Friday night and we were the only ones in the entire restaurant.  We made a reservation, but this probably isn't necessary.

Service: The waiter was attentive and helpful, and did his best despite delivering bad news (for us) about the menu repeatedly.  The staff does not speak great English, and there was some confusion about some of the orders.  One order that was specifically requested not to have egg came out with egg, and that person had to wait for another meal to be prepared while we ate our meals.  The chef came out to apologize and thank us, and she was very friendly.  The staff was patient while we stayed beyond their closing time finishing our wine.

(+): affordable, friendly staff

(-): average to below-average Thai food, online menu does not match real menu

Would I go back again? No. Pittsburgh is loaded with awesome Thai restaurants.  Unless I hear that Little Bangkok has significantly improved, I likely will not go back."}
{"text":"AWESOME! The best Thai food I ever tried.  When on the strip you need to eat here. The drunken rice with shrimp is incredible.  I ordered it with a 7 heat scale.  If my wife wasn't with me, I would have licked the plate clean.  She frowns upon me reverting to my animal nature.   My wife had the drunken noodles with chicken with a 2 heat scale, she loved it.   She found it had a little too much heat, but she still ate everything. Something I have never seen her do in 16 years of marriage.  We ordered the cheese wontons for an appetizer, and they were the best my wife and I ever had.  The wonton was delicate and flakey.  The cheese was tasty.  If you love asian food, you need to try this place.  I live 2 hours away.  I will be coming back sooner than planned, just to eat at this great restaurant."}
{"text":"The kind of Thai food you want in the neighborhood. Well spiced, with each dish having distinct flavors. Not dumbed down. The kind of place to take your friends who know and like Thai food.

4-stars, since we've only been once (which will be remedied soon, I'm sure)."}
{"text":"Went there for weekend lunch as we happened to be in the strip and tried the lunch special. This is def not authentic Thai food, we had the drunken fried rice and the no milk curry, the ingredients in the curry was undercooked (the bamboo esp) and the shrimp in the fried rice was partially raw! Flavours was all over the place, the no milk curry was two dimensional, basically chili water and the fried rice was overly wet (therefore drunken rice?) and super salty and sweet. I'm from south east Asia and been to Thailand many times and this was one of the weirdest American Thai places I've tried. Avoid, many other good places to eat in the Strip and many better Thai places in Pittsburgh for sure."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch after a Saturday shopping trip to the Strip.  Very affordable- $8 gets you a nice sized lunch, which includes a very good light soup.  I've been here several times and the service has been terrific each time.  Very friendly people working here.  This is a great alternative to the standard pizza, subs, etc. that are so prevalent in the Strip."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. I come here all the time from work. There are a bunch of lunch specials, I usually get pad thai or curry. You get a soup with it and it comes out to about $10. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Nice inside and they have limited seating outside"}
{"text":"One of my favorite thai restaurants! The rice and spring rolls were so yummy as well as the vegetable broth!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat lunch in the strip...  Try to go about once a week.  Friendly staff and great food, fast."}
{"text":"Great location and street feel in the Strip district, ample seating and small patio in front. Large portion sizes, great Thai Spicy Basil, only thing keeping from five star was okay drunken noodles. Prices are comparable and service was cheerful."}
{"text":"Little Bangkok is a solid option for Thai food in the area. It is by no means, however, among the best in Thai food that the city has to offer.

I had the pad kra pow with minced chicken over rice with bell peppers in a basil sauce with a fried egg. It was good, but slightly on the salty and oily side. My companion had the pad see ew, which he described as mediocre. I was not impressed with the flavor of his dish.

Prices were a little steep for the flavor and quality of the food.

The service is good, the restaurant is clean and bright. We arrived on a Thursday evening at 7:30pm; there were only 2 other patrons in the restaurant with us.

Overall, Thai Gourmet in Bloomfield is still the best value and taste in Pittsburgh's Thai food scene."}
{"text":"We visited for the first time and loved it! The service was fast and efficient and the food was delicious! I ordered green curry spice level 4 and it was very good - and spicy- perfect! My husband ordered the garlic stir fry and he loved the flavor of it! Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Little Bangkok is a good restaurant in a neighborhood full of good things to eat. I appreciate their bravado in opening in such a place. 

Chef Penny is very proud of her food and her heritage, and she's one of the kindest people I've ever met. This is reflected in her cooking. It's fresh, wholesome and delicious. 

This place is large and features outdoor seating, so I've never had a problem getting a table. Service has been good and usually above-average. I know the chef, so I've been at the entrance to the kitchen to say hello--it's spotless back there."}
{"text":"This is a very good, inexpensive Thai place in the middle of the Strip. We both had curry dishes, and the food was tasty and plentiful. Service was attentive. Bill for 2 was under $40 with an app and tea included. Decor is not fancy- exposed brick painted a nice pastel shade, high ceiling, a couple of large potted trees- but it's pleasant and calming. Very satisfied with 1st visit here."}
{"text":"Authentic food at a reasonable price.Good service.chicken satay and  Tom kar is a must to eat here."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch during the week. Very well cooked Thai. Nicely sauced and spiced. Appropriate quantity and price."}
{"text":"This is legitimate Thai food. Not a Chinese takeout place's reinterpretation of Thai so that they can jump on the \"Thai is cool\" bandwagon. This is the real deal. Some flavors appear to have been toned down for the American taste (please don't; or offer an option for \"American\" or \"the real deal\"). But this is the best Thai I've had in the northeast. Better than any Thai places I used to frequent in NYC for sure. This is a gem to have in Pittsburgh. I hope everyone supports it!"}
{"text":"Nice Thai place. Drunk noodles were decent. I like drunken noodles that have Bok choy, basil, egg and noodles like Siam and nicki's. This one had more mixed vegetables. Still pretty good. Also had the Rangoons and they were great. Good lunch service. Quick and fresh food. Overall good experience but not my favorite Thai place."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  It was a nice quiet place after walking the noisy streets of the Strip District.  Service was a bit disorganized."}
{"text":"Pumpkin curry was AMAZING!!! So cute and byob. Must try!"}
{"text":"First things first. Parking in the Strip is ridiculous, especially on weekends. So this isn't as much of a destination restaurant as it is the place you go to when you're doing your Saturday cruise of the strip, buying way more biscotti than you can or should eat, and contemplating for the thousandth time whether you should go smoke a cigar at that shady little tea and smoke shop. Having said that, if you find yourself suddenly in need of food, and you are completely repulsed by the lines at Pamela's, Deluca's, Wholey's, Luke Wholey's, and Roland's (tip: you shouldn't be going to Roland's), and/or you just prefer Thai food--you should go to this place. The chicken satay was cooked perfectly, and the sauce delicious. Get the fresh spring rolls, they're great. The pad see eiw was completely proficient. And the staff is good about keeping glasses full. Solid."}
{"text":"While walking through the strip in search of lunch, we spotted Little Bangkok and agreed that we needed to spice it up a bit.  It was a nice afternoon so we opted for a sidewalk table.  Our severs were very pleasant and the food was prepared and served quickly.  My husband had Pad See Ew with beef, and I had Drunken Noodles with chicken.  We liked that they let you pick the spice level from the low end of 1 all the way up to high end of 10.  My husband picked one of the numbers on the lower end, and I picked an 8.  It was just ok, maybe a little bit salty, and not spicy enough for me.  Next time I should go with a 10 and not worry about crying over Drunken Noodles."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a reccomendation from a local! Food was really good. Tastes fresh and delish! Had Drunken fried rice and spice thai basil combination!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Little Bangkok last night at around 8pm, and it took over 10 minutes to get seated even though the restaurant was half empty.  (They should consider hiring an extra staff as it looks like the 2 waitresses there were being overworked.) It also took awhile to get our food and our check. 

Nonetheless, the food was pretty tasty!  I got the Pad Kra Tiem, which was super flavorful! It came on a decent size plate filled with chicken, bell peppers, broccoli and baby corn with a bowl of rice on the side. My boyfriend got the Bangkok Spicy Basil, which he really enjoyed as well. However, the rice was harder than normal and the Thai ice tea tasted water down. We also order a chicken Tom Yum soup to share at spicy level 7 --- should have gotten a level 6. Haha.  

In the end, I won't be running back here for my next meal. But if I'm in the neighborhood, I'll definitely consider it."}
{"text":"I walked by the place a few times when they first opened, but seriously, the other Asian places on the strip are so hit and miss, I did not want to be the guinea pig.  Finally ate there last night, because of the Pirates game, and not wanting to have to fight traffic at Nicky's.

I am going to be hitting this place as often as I can until I get burned out.  Wife had the drunken noodles.  She asked for spice level 6, which was still really mild,  Really really really delicious!  She had it with beef, which is not a tenderized type of meat you get in most places, but a hard cooked really well seasoned kind of dried out chunks of meat, which is EXACTLY how you get it in the home of a Thai.  REALLY authentic.

I got he Pad Kra Tiem (garlic) with beef.  Spice level 6.  Mine was nice and spicy, absolutely great!!!  And, just ask for extra crushed peanuts, and you also ask for the side platter of seasonings.

Oh, and got the spring riolls as well.  They are vegan, and amazingly good!  Instead of a couple of big rolls wrapped in rice paper, you get a platter, of smaller rolls, that are sliced up and served around a bowl of peanut sauce.

The one thing I hate about most Thai places is, they do not use galangel, or tamarind, and you leave the place saying, \"it LOOKED nice, but the taste was missing something...\"  Well, you will not get that \"missing something\" at this place.  If you do not like the food here, it is because you just have a different flavor profile than I do.  I spent years in the Air Force, long enough ago so that most of my supervisors had Thai wives, and this food nailed what I used to get when I would go to their homes for dinner."}
{"text":"I think they did a little modifications to the traditional Thai recipes to meet the flavor more accepted to the masses and they did it successfully! I enjoyed the a creamy soup with mixed flavors of spicy, mint and lemon dancing on the tip of my tongue."}
{"text":"I don't frequent Thai restaurants too often but this place was great! They have some amazing 8 dollar lunch specials and the waitress even made me iced green tea even though it wasn't on the menu. You get to choose how spicy you want your dish to be from a scale of 1 to 10! And 10 is actually spicy!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  Every time we've gone, we always end up saying, this is some of the best Thai we've ever had.  Bonus points for the ginger tea, which is heavenly!"}
{"text":"i love this place however i only ever order the drunken fried rice. place doesnt have all the thrills but whatever"}
{"text":"The pineapple curry was tragic. Throwing chili flakes on as an after thought isn't \"spicy,\" it's trashy. I tried to like it, as I like most places in the strip. The pad thai was even below average. I definitely wouldn't go again with so many delicious options nearby."}
{"text":"I really like thai food.  I've been to a lot of thai places around the country and this is my favorite.  The yum salad is very unique and I love the drunken noodles with tofu.  And I would also recommend the summer roles.  It is a great place for lunch or a great place to grab dinner before a night out."}
{"text":"Very delicious authentic thai.  Really friendly people and they will make it spicier than the normal scale if you ask."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite places to eat in the Strip District. The Bangkok spicy basil with tofu is beyond amazing. They ask you to provide a spice level 1 to 10, I eat everything spicy (I mean add sriracha to everything under the sun) and even I have to stop at a level 7 here. I have eaten in and I have ordered delivery, there is absolutely no difference in the quality or quantity. You cannot go wrong either way. The restaurant itself is a great place to eat and the staff is delightful. Delivery is incredibly fast. Do yourself a favor and eat here often!"}
{"text":"I've been spoiled by Nikki Thai pineapple fried rice with shrimp. This is ok but definitely not worth the $16. I paid. The rice was soggy. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I think I'm on a mission to find the best Tom Kah (kar... whatever) in Pittsburgh. This place has a decent bowl of it and that's why I ordered from here. The only thing I didn't like was the tofu that they used wasn't firm enough but that's okay. It also could've been a bit spicier but thats just what I prefer. They also have good Pad Thai that isn't overpowered by a peanut taste and they understand the importance of having the lime flavor. One thing I loved about the pad Thai was that there were big chunks of real chicken. Made it a lot heartier. I was sufficiently full after eating this meal. I also ordered the crispy Thai rolls which were super cute because they were basically mini spring rolls. They were a bit mushy but I think it's because I got it from Postmates. Decently priced. I'd order from here again."}
{"text":"There were 8 people sitting in here and the woman said they were \"so busy\" it would take me 25 minutes to get my food. It's a fucking stir fry, people, it takes seconds! In the end I didn't get my food until *40 minutes later*. Seriously. And it wasn't that great (pad see eil with tofu)."}
{"text":"Probably the most underwhelming Thai experience I've had yet in the 'Burgh. Hubby and I went for lunch on a busy Strip Saturday, excited to try a new place in a neighborhood that's filled with lots of restaurants, many of them so-so. We started with the summer roll, which looked very good when it hit the table; filled with fresh looking veggies and served with the ubiquitous peanut sauce, a favorite of mine. The issue I had with this app was that the rice paper wrapper was tough and not at all pliable. Perhaps they hadn't soaked it properly? Moving on to the mains, I had my usual green curry, this time with tofu. This curry was truly bad, with a thick, gloppy texture and oil that had separated out of the sauce. Yuck. The veggies were fresh, but had not been prepped with care, so that they were many different shapes and sizes and hadn't cooked evenly. My partner had the red curry and I must admit it looked a lot better then the green. He claimed it was not the best he'd had and not the worst. These people are very nice and, while I wish them the best, I also wish they were taking more care in the kitchen."}
{"text":"So glad we stumbled upon this place!  Don't let the lack of decor fool you!! Very good food and great service to go along with it! I had the Pumpkin curry with shrimp which was amazing. Spicy level was perfect. My BF had the Drunken Noodles with Beef and nearly licked his plate clean.  The Summer Rolls left a bit to be desired. Although, the sauce was very good. I would recommend and look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"If you are having a hankering for Thai, look no further, Little Bangkok will do the trick.  A solid little restaurant with attentive service.  I ordered the chicken satay for an appetizer and, for 5$, it can easily be a meal.  There were at least six sizable chicken strips with two tasty dips.  I also got the Pad Thai with shrimp.  A heaping plateful comes with plenty of shrimp.  Very pleased with my dinner and would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food!  Our first time here & will be back.  Owner was warm & welcoming too.  The Thai Basil with Tilapia was delicious.  The tom khai (coconut soup) with tofu was outstanding.  We got the pot which was huge."}
{"text":"I ordered the Bangkok Spicy Basil with Shrimp as well as the fish cake appetizer. 
The Bangkok Spicy Basil was made with brown chili sauce infused with Thai basil, onion, mushroom, bell pepper, bamboo, broccoli, and jalapeno in a spicy level # 5. 

The ambiance of the restaurant is very lovely and each table is adorned with a small vase of fresh flowers.  Apparently the kitchen is up a short flight of wooden stairs.  The waitress ran up and down the stairs to get orders and this made a loud raucous and was distracting from the meal and not very thoughtful to the diners. I am not sure if the restaurants knows just how loud it sounds to hear them running up and down the stairs.  

The food tasted good, but it was not better than either of the Nicky's Thai restaurants and the service was impersonal."}
{"text":"I will admit I haven't been to a 100 Thai places. Little Bangkok on the Strip is a cool little stop. I went with the Little Drunken fried rice added the chicken.  I was jealous of one of the other plates of food at the table. It just looked better. My lunch was good, heavy garlic, level 4 on spice but I wanted more color. Lord knows the wife won't be kissing me because the garlic will be with me all night. Whew! Anyway, the service was very good, clean, but we had to ask for water twice. I mean why the small glasses of water then? Water is free or leave a pitcher. The is very good price for the strip as well. The next time I go I need to go with a different choice on the menu for sure. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Maybe I just had bad luck here, but I wasn't impressed with the food. The service was friendly enough, but the food was worse than other Pittsburgh Thai restaurants I've been to. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal. I have not had a dish here that I have not liked. I work in the Strip, and this is one of my go to places for a great take-out meal for lunch. The food is always ready within 10/15 minutes, and is steaming hot still after my 10 minute walk back to where I work.

The Drunken Noodle with chicken spice level 8 is my favorite. The flavor and spice level make this a wonderful dish. As well, the  soup that comes with lunch is amazing. So simple, but it has gotten me to like tofu."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from this store. So disappointed. The drunken noodle was over cooked and the pad tai was way over sweet. The spring vegetable roll was good and it was carefully wrapped as well. That was the only thing I liked from the order. Maybe it would be different if we eat there. But I do not think it worth to try."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for fried rice tonight. I opted for the pineapple fried rice with vegetables and the fried wontons. The fried rice was perfect. The rice was full of flavor itself. Then add tons of fresh veggies and a plethora of pineapple and it really hot the spot. I really appreciated how seasoned everything was. Not just salt, not just spice (I went with a level 3 and it was just a light lingering heat).  It was really good fried rice. 

The crab wontons were slightly greasy, but tasty. The thick sweet sauce was a perfect addition to the rice too. 

I ordered delivery through GrubHub. The food traveled very well and I'll definitely do delivery (and probably eat in) again. 


I have to post an update. I ordered the same thing. But the gentleman who delivered my food said he worked here too. I was struggling with a package when he showed up with my food. He went above and beyond to deliver my food, offer me help, and wish me a lovely evening. It sounds like a little thing, but I can't tell you how many times people just walk by. To hire people like this, I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Just ate there tonight. Everything was excellent. Veggies were fresh an believe them when they something is spicy. The staff were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 4 times now (three times takeout), and have to say... this place is great!  Having been to all of the \"good\" Thai places in Pittsburgh, this may be my favorite Thai food.  The green curry and red curry are amazing!  Quite possibly the best I've ever had.  The drunken noodles were great.  There is something on the menu in the fried rice section that is topped with an over easy egg... I was a little skeptical at first, but wow!  I will order that again.  I've ordered everything at a 7/10 spicy level, and its perfect for me.  Spicy, but not over powering by any means. The food is made from fresh ingredients, which, can be hard to find in Asian restaurants.

The ambiance is nothing special, a nice, clean atmosphere.  There was no one in there when I've been there, but don't be discouraged, there will be once word gets out.  The server was great.

The only downside in my opinion is that they don't take American Express... a pet peeve of mine.

If you are looking for a great place for Thai, this is it!  Oh, an it's BYOB!!!"}
{"text":"Yes please I really enjoyed the wonderful Penang curry combination with shrimp chicken and beef. My wife had the combination fried rice and she loved it too. Her side pineapple. And we will be coming back here."}
{"text":"I used uber eats to order from here because i was craving fried rice hardcore. I was definitely not disappointed. I ordered the drunken fried rice which said it was supposed to be spicy but wasn't. I think that's my fault since i ordered it to go and didn't give them a spice level so I will have to specify next time. Regardless of the non-spiciness, their fried rice was awesome. It tasted so great and you really get a decent portion size. I will definitely be getting food here again, as well as updating my review when I get my spicy fried rice next time!"}
{"text":"I eat at this place regularly since 2013. It's been great! Love the Tom Kha soup. There must have been a change in the kitchen over the past half year or full year. They've been getting orders incorrect and whoever is making the soup needs to learn some knife skills or needs to be trained in proper size ratios for the human mouth. I wasn't going to post a picture, but this is the 2nd large cabbage root I found in the same order of soup. The same thing happened in the past 2 orders I got there too, but because I've had a high percentage of good food there I have them the benefit of the doubt. I'm afraid they're getting sloppy though."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and was blown away by their food! Their menu makes it easy to see what is in each dish and their prices are very affordable. I had the Pad kra tiem (garlic) and shrimp spice level 7, spice was right and not overwhelming. The service was great, I'm excited to go back to try different dishes."}
{"text":"Great food, Good price, had crab wonton & red curry. No complaints & good service. would recommend"}
{"text":"I feel like I'm missing the boat but I was not impressed with the food at Little Bangkok. My husband and I ordered Little Bangkok for the first time and had it delivered.
The Tom Kar soup was good. I did not like the fish cakes at all. Gave them all to my husband to eat. I thought the fish cakes were going to be crispy but they weren't, they were soft and chewy. Also ordered the Pad See Ew (vegetarian). Not bad but pretty basic flavors and not a lot of veggies. 
The menu is pretty small, only 3 noodle dishes. 
Their food wasn't bad however it wasn't anything special and probably wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"We had a good experience with the food and the service when we went.
We ordered as an appetizer the \"chicken saute\" and split an entree of \"pad see ew\"."}
{"text":"Little Bangkok was next in line for my self appointed mission to eat at every Thai restaurant in the city and surrounding area. I know! Not a bad task!!! I embrace it with enthusiasm! And so it was that the four us set out to try this peculiar little store front on Penn avenue. We brought a bottle of champagne to celebrate some recent events and elected to sit outside on a gorgeous day at one of the 2 or 3 tables on the crowded sidewalk. Although it can be, at first, distracting with all the pedestrian traffic, we settled in to some people watching, aided by the champagne. Yum. 

The menu has some different entrees than other Thai places and to aid in your selection, there are poster boards with photos of some of the food surrounding you. To be frank, these pictures look like grade school attempts at food photography and are more off putting than enticing. But ignore those. The food is way better than those pics!!

We started with some fresh spring rolls which I always find to be a good test of what the food may be like. These were superb! Fresh ingredients and super tasty. Highly recommended. I ordered the Pad Kraw Pow - minced chicken and bell peppers in a spicy basil sauce over steamed rice and topped with two sunny side up eggs. It was quite tasty and the spice level was as requested. My only minor complaint is that the chicken was minced a little too fine for my taste. I would rather have had it in chunks. My wife got the Pad Kra Tiem with mixed seafood and was the hands down winner. Over a bed of veggies and with loads of garlic and pepper sauce, this was a knockout. 

The two vegetarians ordered tofu dishes - drunken noodles and drunken rice - both huge hits. I sampled just a taste and wholeheartedly agree. Delightful! 

Service was a tad slow but not annoyingly so. Could be because we ate outside. We didn't get charged the listed $3 corkage fee which was a nice bonus! 

If you're in the strip and are craving some flavorful Thai food, you can't go wrong here!! Try it!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Thai food. I go here about twice a month, at least, for lunch. The place is normally never packed, which is great for lunch, but it is by no means empty. Some of my favorite dishes here are their Tom Kar hot pot, drunken noodles, and Pad Kra Tiem; however, my favorite dish is their Thai Rama Chicken. Thai Rama Chicken is chicken satay turned into an entree...very delicious peanut sauce and the chicken is grilled wonderfully. I've been to many Thai restaurants and can't recall any others having something similar to this with even going out of my way a couple times to ask other Thai restaurants if they could make it (to no avail)."}
{"text":"I met a friend here between my rehearsals one day, and we each had an hour and a half for lunch.  This place is definitely quick enough for a lunch break, if you have budgeted time.

I like the relaxed vibe this place gives off.  There is a nice little vase of flowers on each table.  The waiter tried to seat us at a two top right by the door when we came in, which was kind of rude, as the place was empty.  I understand trying to sell small tables is hard, but when it's deserted, you don't do that.  We ended up moving to the upper level, which is much better.

We started off with the Fish Cakes ($6).  I've never tried this dish, but I liked it a lot.  They're just fried fish patties, but they were good.  The presentation was very nice as well.

Since I had to go sing, I couldn't get my Pad Thai with chicken ($11) spicy at all (Curse you, acid reflux.).  However, the portion was good, and I enjoyed the dish.  It was enough for two meals, for sure.

Our server was good, and we had water refills throughout the meal.  As much as I enjoyed my meal, though, I don't think this place is anything \"special.\"  But it's definitely good food for a good price."}
{"text":"Since I have developed an obsession with Thai food, it was only appropriate that I give Little Bangkok a chance.  My husband and I decided to give it a whirl one Sunday when we were meandering around the Strip.  

When we entered, I think we were the only guests there, but it picked up shortly after. The food seemed spicier than what I'm used to when asking for the same spice levels (I'm a wimp, 3-4 is my max) but it was still good and edible (too hot = I cannot eat).  The soup was good, spring rolls, and curry.  Service was fast too!

This little place should be on your list of places to check out!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch downtown! Great food, reasonable prices and good service. I had the Pad Thai which was amazing and have heard multiple people rave about the Tom Yum soup. (Too spicy for me, I'm a huge baby!)

We've also ordered delivery to our office through Uber Eats when we were unable to venture out.

Great place all around!"}
{"text":"Had an enjoyable lunch with the family on MLK Day. My son's pad thai was too sweet for my taste and needed salt, but he enjoyed it. My wife had a hot pot with lots of vegetables. Very flavorful. The flavor of my massaman curry was excellent. Eggplant was supposed to be the veggie star, however, but it only had a few. There were more shrimp than eggplant pieces and way too much green pepper. Service was quick and our waitress was exceedingly nice. A good lunch time spot."}
{"text":"On a visit to the Strip, my friends and I came across this Thai place that we were looking forward to eating at. I came with three friends, and we were seated as soon as we arrived. We ordered the Fresh Bangkok Summer Roll, Pad Thai with tofu, and Drunken Fried Rice with vegetables. They offered spice level of 0 to 10 for the Pad Thai and Drunken Fried Rice, and we chose 3 for both. 

The Summer Roll was refreshing and light, so it serves for a good appetizer. The Pad Thai tasted standard to me: good, but doesn't particularly stand out. On the other hand, I quite liked the Drunken Fried Rice flavor. The Drunken Fried Rice is noticeably spicier than the Pad Thai, likely because the Drunken Fried Rice is made spicy in nature. Would definitely recommend the rice for its good flavor!

Overall not bad, the lunch specials are a good deal. Since we ate family style, it ended up being ~$8 for each of us plus the price of the drinks we individually ordered."}
{"text":"WARNING: THE SPICE SCALE IS NOT AMERICANIZED!!!
But Little Bangkok burns soooo good.
If you think you like a level 10 spicy, you might want to start with a 7, my Girlfriend thought she was a 6, here she is a 3. 
That being said, this place is fantastic. The service is over the top friendly and The strip is a perfect place for a great Thai restaurant, with fresh produce and Asian markets lining the streets. Everything I've had here is incredible. If you like dumplings, these are some of the best. 
Anyways, stop reading reviews and go eat here."}
{"text":"Conveniently located if you want good Thai in the Strip. The food is very good, we love the crab fried rice and the Pad See Eew. Haven't ever dined in so can't speak to the service, but take out has always been good."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty, particularly the pad see ew. The Bangkok spicy basil was also quite good, though perhaps a bit heavy on the sauce. Spicy levels seem to be on the mild side, and we have fewer reservations here about going higher on the scale to 10 than at other places. Service was a bit slow for an early Sunday afternoon, but the wait for the food wasn't too long after our orders were taken. I like the fact that lunch specials are available daily, with an extensive menu of noodles, stir fry, rice, and curries. Overall good stop in the Strip district!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some spicy thai food to fight off the cold on this snowy Sunday afternoon. While Nicky's had just opened downtown, we were looking for some coffee and other supplies in the strip and I figured I'd give this place a shot. 

The restaurant is sparsely decorated, having two levels with a dozen or so tables. We were shown to our seat and presented with a lunch menu. A handful of curries and popular noodle dishes, all from $7-9, plus a few appetiziers, Tom Yum Soup, and a few rice dishes. Their full menu is also available at lunch, with prices in the $12-15 range.

The waiter gave us  water and took our order, each of us getting a chicken Tom Yum Soup and me getting a green curry with beef(10 spicy), and my friend getting a chicken Pad See Eil(7 spicy). The soup arrived first, sadly not being very flavorful - Mostly of standard chicken broth with an afterthought of lemongrass. It had a few pieces of carrot and some cilantro and flavorless chicken, and no spice to be found at all.

The main dishes arrived shortly after - I wasn't able to try my friend's Pad See Eil, but the green curry was passable. Containing mostly peppers and bamboo shoots, the few pieces of beef were tough, but the flavor of the green curry was decent enough to satisfy me. The curry was full of chiles, but unfortunately they did little to provide the spice I was hoping for. I'd have rated the dish I was given at a 6 or so. My friend was able to finish her Pad See Eil, but had no strong words to say about it one way or the other. 

The service was quick, but water was never refilled. The whole experience cost about $25 which I thought was a decent price for lunch. The portions were satisfying, not huge(But I also decided go without rice), which left me in a good mood and ready to wander through the snow again.

If I'm ever in the Strip, I'd consider stopping by again, but it's more likely that I'll wind up at Nicky's. For a quick thai food fix, though, the fare here is decent"}
{"text":"I heart Thai food. When on a recent mission to try as many Thai places in Pittsburgh as possible, Little Bangkok came up on my radar. What a little gem this place is! Small storefront that opens up to a larger than expected dining space in this Strip District location. Not overly Thai in the decor, but comfortable enough. But I'm not looking for multiple Buddhas or golden elephant statues. I'm hungry! And Little Bangkok delivers on flavor!
The summer rolls were filled with delicious, fresh basil and mint, very refreshing and a welcome start to a good meal. The crispy veggie Bangkok roll was lightly fried and served with a sweet plum sauce that I couldn't get enough of. But the highlight for me was my entree. The drunken noodles were crazy good. These wide, stir fried rice noodles are incredible. Light and filling at the same time, drenched with a spicy basil sauce that made me want to lick my plate. The tofu was well cooked, not mushy or overly spongy like I've experienced elsewhere. My wife got the drunken rice and it was a delicious dish also. 
After my first visit here, I dreamt of those fat, exquisite rice noodles. I craved them. I ordered drunken noodles from another Thai restaurant, but it didn't hold a candle to Little Bangkok. So my next visit, I ordered them again. And I was thrilled that they were everything I recalled from my first visit. I'd be hard pressed to order anything else from this tasty menu until I can get those drunken noodles out of my system!
I'm thrilled that we found this yummy Thai treat in the strip! Looking forward to having another round of drunken noodles again in the near future!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a place to grab some dinner in the strip on a Saturday night. As we were walking around, we stumbled upon this place because the sign on the restaurants had pictures of dishes that looked amazing. So we went in looked at the menu and decided to eat our dinner here. We got two appetizers, Bangkok roll and Steamed Dumplings, which were both delicious. My friend got the Pad See Ew, which he really enjoyed and I got the Chicken Pineapple Curry Spice level 5. This was my first ever time trying Curry, and let me tell you, it was delicious!! The spice level was perfect because you could taste the flavors yet it still left an after burn in your mouth that lingered for a bit and the pineapples added a nice sweet touch to all the heat going on. I am definitely now hooked on Curry and highly recommend this place! It is amazing!"}
{"text":"I like Little Bangkok and will eat there on occasion. The service is fast and friendly. I recommend eating here if you are in the area, but do not go out of your way."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant with a Groupon. It's tucked away right on Penn Ave. The decor is simple with touches of Thai design. 

The staff was friendly and I was greeted as soon as I entered. I brought my grandfather for his first Thai experience and they were incredibly patient and helpful in him deciding what to order. 

My grandfather ordered the Pad Keing. It's a dish with ginger as the base for the sauce. It came with vegetables and he selected chicken as his meat. It also came with rice. He really enjoyed it. He ordered a 5 out of 10 for spice level but said he could of gotten it spicier. The ginger was very dominant. If you like ginger, this is a great dish for you. 

I went with my staple green curry. I also ordered a 5 but could of gone spicier. My dish also came with rice. It was standard in flavor but a large portion. I would order it again. Both of us also received a starter soup that consisted of broth, shredded vegetables, and soft tofu.

I enjoyed my time at the restaurant and would certainly come back again."}
{"text":"I love love love Thai food, and this place is no exception.  My friend and I went and turned a bunch of appetizers into a tapas-type meal (as we often do).  We basically got all the fried ones, and they were all very good.  The only warning I have is that their tom kha soup is very very coconut-y - very thick, sweet, concentrated.  I took it home and added a bit of chicken stock before heating it up for leftovers.  It was perfect then."}
{"text":"In a continuing quest to find new restaurants to try, I took a walk farther out from the hotel into the Strip District. Little Bangkok is a smallish restaurant, sandwiched between other dining establishments on Penn Avenue. The dining area only has a small number of tables, so it's a good thing the restaurant wasn't too busy this evening. On the plus side, since the staff had only a small number of tables to watch over, service was pretty good. Water refills were given without my even having to ask.

The food is pretty good. It's different and possibly more authentic than other Thai restaurants I've tried. I had the Thai Rama Chicken this time with a spiciness level of 6. That wasn't actually very spicy until I got to the chilis under the chicken. The price seemed a bit steep for Thai food but the portion size was quite generous."}
{"text":"After exploring the Strip district for a few hours, my friend and I were in the mood for Thai food. This place had a good bustle of customers, so we checked it out for lunch! I had the pad see eil with tofu, and my friend had the pineapple curry. Mmmmm.

+ The server was very polite and friendly. Even though there were a lot of customers, she didn't take long to get our order. Food also came out quickly! 
+ You can choose your spiciness level from 1 to 10. I am a wimp and picked 2, and it was a comfortable level for me. My friend got 7, and even as a fan of spicy food, it was pretty hot for her. Be warned... they seriously mean business about their spiciness level. 
+ Portion size was good for less than $10. I got to take some leftovers home.  
+ I don't know too much about Thai cuisine, but I was happy with my food. It was very tasty.

I was pretty satisfied with Little Bangkok, and I would visit it again if I was nearby!"}
{"text":"Wonderful filling station for the strip on a Saturday afternoon! Don't go over a 7 on the spicy ness as you will not enjoy the great flavor of the food! We had the crab Rangoon and the steamed dumplings as a app! We then went with the drunken noodle and rice with chicken and beef!! Good stuff!! Like I said late lunch early dinner on a Saturday just perfect!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here.  It's definitely been the best Thai I've had in Pittsburgh.  The food is 5 stars for sure.  I ordered the drunken noodles with vegetables.  The spice was just right for me at an 8, and the spices and flavor of the noodles were excellent.  The vegetables accompanied with some basil were also quite fresh and provided a lot of flavor.  

Now the only reason it is not receiving 5 stars for me is the lack of ambiance and finishing touches in the place.  It's frankly, barren in the place.  Also, when we were there during the evening it was super cold in the place.  My partner couldn't even take his scarf off.  With that in mind, I would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner while in Pittsburg. Had spicy garlic basil with chicken (I chose spicy scale 4, just a little bit over my liking for spicy but it wasn't overwhelming). Also had fresh spring rolls as appetizer, it's light and fresh.. the sauce was good. Wish I could order more but wouldn't be able to eat it all! If I ever go back to Pitts I'd eat there again."}
{"text":"The best pad kee Mao in downtown Pittsburgh. Period. The server who is always there knew us by name and knew our order by heart. Food is always fast, consistent, and I love the atmosphere of the place. If you're downtown or near the strip... Go to Little Bangkok!"}
{"text":"I ate here this past Sunday afternoon with my girlfriend and her parents for lunch.  My girlfriend and I have walked by this place many times in the past but had kept it on our list of places to try.  We arrived here at about 11:15 or so and the place was completely empty.  As a matter of a fact after we seated what looked like a fresh cut flower was placed on every table except for ours, presumably not to interrupt us.  It was then that I noticed the beautiful bouquets of fresh flowers by the door.  Other than the flower though, the place seemed fairly plain.  After we were seated, we were given menus opened to the lunch special page.  What I liked about it is that they had about 20 or so choices that all cost exactly the same depending on the type of meat that you were getting and only one item on the lunch menu cost more than the rest. Since I normally eat the same thing at every Thai place, I decided to switch it up and went with the beef Jungle Curry at a spice level 10 out of 10.  It was a non coconut based curry with eggplant, bamboo, baby corn, bell pepper, carrot and a side of rice.  We also decided to have the fish cakes and crab wontons appetizer.  The appetizer came out first and was pretty good.  The crab wontons had a good savory filling and were much more delicate than I expected and paired nicely with the sweet and sour sauce.  Meanwhile the fish cakes were not what I was expecting as they sort of looked, felt and tasted like sausage but were still good.  As a nice surprise our lunch specials were also served with soup which none of us had noticed on the menu.  The soup was a light broth with some carrots, other vegetables and tofu in it and carried and had a very pleasing heat and the finish.  Finally my Jungle curry was very good.  The spice level was prefect and I also thought that most of the flavors were good as well.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  All of the food that I tried was good, they put a good amount of spice in my food and I thought that the lunch specials were very affordable and fair for what you got."}
{"text":"I stopped for lunch takeout today and got the pumpkin curry with all vegetables-spicy #5. I could have gotten it spicier, but I went with 5 because I wasn't sure how hot they make their curry. It was made in 10 minutes and came with soup. The total was only $8.56. It was a good deal, Quick service, and delicious food! My only complaint is that there were only three chunks of pumpkin in the curry. I also assumed there would be eggplant since I got all vegetables, but there was not. Definitely will be trying all the kinds of curry soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ride our tandem from our home near the Water Front to the Strip most Saturdays year round. We discovered Little Bangkok a few years ago just after it opened at this location. We eat lunch there almost every Saturday. We love Thai food, and this has become one of our favorite places. The waiter and now the owner have come to know us, but the service has always been very attentive. My favorite is the Drunken Noodle, which I usually have with chicken. It is always a good mix of flavors, and there is just something so satisfying about the texture of the wide noodles. My husband's favorite is Spicy Basil. Their spicing is so good that we don't have to ramp up our numbers to get some kick. We always start out with veggie Tom Yum, which is a symphony of textures and flavors. We have tried other things on the menu, which are always good, but seem to come back to this standard order. He likes to accompany his with Thai iced tea. I recommend the ginger tea, a spicy brew that is just right with the food. Most recently, I got home from a conference where all the food was good, but bland, and we almost raced there for a lunch that woke up our senses."}
{"text":"loved this pace.....great for lunch.  Well prepared, fresh ingredients, friendly staff, and fair prices."}
{"text":"Loved Our sever Penny and her helper Glen. Great service- so friendly. They put a very personal touch in all their food. The drunken noodles and Crab wonton were amazing. If we lived in Pitt we would be here at least once a month. Alas, we were passing through... those lucky enough to live close- enjoy!"}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite thai place! The drunken noodles were awesome. Tons of veggies and chicken and a delicious sauce with the perfect amount of basil to cool your mouth off. And it's BYOB, with a corkage fee, which is just the icing on the cake as far as I am concerned.
My friend stated that this may be her new favorite Pad Thai place. Took the hubbie on a different occasion and he stated that he still prefers Red Bowl's Pad Thai, in Cranberry, but that this was a nice change. 
Service was very friendly and fast. They offer take out and lunch options as well. 
The red curry with chicken was also amazing, I ordered it for takeout on a separate occasion (I've been here 3 times, and considering it's at least an hour drive from our home, thats a VERY good sign!)"}
{"text":"I've only just visited for the first time last night but I'm already hooked. If you crave authentic Thai food this is your joint (and by \"authentic\" I mean spicy as hell!). The folks here give new meaning to \"Thai spicy\" so if that's your thing, look no further (it's definitely MY thing and therefore probably one of the reasons I liked this place so much). The preparations are fresh and flavorful and the service is exceptionally warm, pleasant and attentive. A final word of warning about the spice level: TRUST them when they warn you about how authentic their spice levels are. I'm usually a 10 out of 10 on the spice meter but I went with 7 to be safe and it nearly blew my head off. Nonetheless, the food is excellent, I'd say Top 1 or 2 Thai meals I've ever had in Pittsburgh (and I've had a lot!!)"}
{"text":"Service was prompt without feeling hurried. The Tom Yum soup with vegetables had a delicate flavor, the spring rolls were great as was the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"We visit Pittsburgh for a week twice per year and as vegans we are always looking for new places to eat. Our regular spot in the Strip District happened to be closed so we quickly searched for something else. I don't know why we haven't tried this place before because it was wonderful! 

There were several vegan options or dishes that were easily made vegan. The owner was even nice enough to make our Thai iced tea with coconut milk. Yum!

The owner was so nice and helpful. She pointed out all of the vegan options, made suggestions and was very attentive. This will definitely be a place we visit regularly."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential.

I came here with my dad a few days back and it was pretty empty inside. The decor was a bit sparse and the tables were just functional. We had to wait a bit for the hostess to seat us and we ordered two Thai iced teas, the fish cake starter, and regular spice level yellow curry and garlic beef (not sure of the menu name but it was a special). The fish cakes were spongy and chewy like those you find in Chinese hot pot. They were deep fried too and came with a sweet chili sauce. Would not recommend. The yellow curry had a decent amount of spice in it, making my dad crave more rice. It was also kind of sweet and a large portion. The garlic beef was way too salty. I had already eaten a decent amount before my dad suggested asking for them to remake it. We tried to complain to the waitress, but she just asked us if we wanted more rice to wash it down. 

Overall, I would have given this place 3 stars had it not been for the fact that I love Thai food and want to come here to try other things. Normally I'd get pad Thai or pad see ew but I thought I'd try new things this time, to no success. The most promising dish was their Thai iced tea, not too sweet and a beautiful transformation!"}
{"text":"Yet another great place for some delicious Thai food in Pittsburgh! This has everything you could expect from any good Thai place. The service was fast and our server was very polite. 

I give a 4 really only because the atmosphere. We were able to sit outside on the sidewalk which was nice because it was it was perfect weather but the patio furniture could be a little nicer/cleaner. The interior seemed very clean. The prices are pretty average. 

Red curry is my absolute favorite anytime I get Thai and this place did not disappoint! The  curry was slight thicker than I've had elsewhere but it was delicious nonetheless. The curry spice scale is 3-10. 4 was hot enough for me. The husband got a 6 for his green curry and it was also good. I like some spice but not too much and I could eat a 6 if that's helps. I always get extra veggies and tofu which they were happy to do for me. The fried tofu app was better than I've had at some places except I didn't like that they put a lot of peanuts on the spicy sauce that comes with it. 

As far as dessert goes, if you like sticky rice, you must get the coconut sticky rice with coconut ice cream! It is amazing! So amazing, I want some now! If you've never had sticky rice and you don't know what I'm talking about, you must get the coconut sticky rice with coconut ice cream! I'd like to try the mango sticky rice too but it was out of season while we were there. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I like Asian food when it is made with fresh ingredients. Great food and dessert steam sticky rice cake with banana"}
{"text":"I've been here twice for takeout, and I have been disappointed both times. I've tried the  Drunken noodles and Pad thai, and both were bland and unappetizing. I did try the summer rolls, which were enjoyable with fried tofu, noodles, mint, and basil. Unfortunately, that's not enough to lure me back.   

Side street parking"}
{"text":"We walked up and down the Strip on a Saturday and decided to try this little place with no wait lines. Turns out, it was a great choice. Delicious food. We tried the  vegetarian version of Tom Yum soup, Drunken Noodles, Yellow curry and Crispy veggie Bangkok rolls. 

The Drunken noodles was amazingly delicious.
Extremely great service by the two ladies."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Thai restaurant. There has not been a meal there that I haven't loved. My favorite is between the Spicy Basil, Pad Thai and Black and Gold. The service is always great even when the restaurant is completely packed and always friendly."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and first time trying pumpkin curry.  I don't like highly spicy food so I asked for a level 4 with level 3 as the lowest.  I tell you this was spicy for me, I couldn't have gone any higher. There were plenty vegetables, pumpkin and chicken to mix into the rice. This place is a keeper in my Thai restaurant list."}
{"text":"We came twenty minutes before closing (an act I wasn't sure of, but I came in a group) and the server was happy to have us. We took a long time to order too. Props. Prices were good/average. The Tom Kar was really good. All our food was good. Plenty if vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Wonderful.... The best thai in the berg!!
The place is awesome! The service and food are amazing! Place is a bit quiet and hidden but don't be afraid to give it a shot. Everyone that we've sent there loves it. A 10!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten in a lot of Thai places, over 20 in the past years and at all price ranges.  I have to say that this place is pretty good in comparison.  Went for lunch and was seated immediately.  Menu is not too big and you order you food on a scale from 1-10 in spice.  When ordering this way (which is common in Thai) I usually get an 8 because I like it hot.  My friend got a 5.  Mine was a bit too spicy for her and her 5 did not have enough spice for me but, both were very good.  Our order was drunken noodles and basil chicken.  It is BYOB.  There is not a lot of seating but it is worth a try."}
{"text":"Authentic and perfectly prepared, even during busy hours. Tom Kar is the best coconut based soup and Little Bangkok makes it better than anyone in town. Try the pad kra pow, I promise all non vegetarians will leave satisfied. Owner is genuine and very involved in every meal."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on UberEATS. Food came 20 minutes before estimated arrival time - you can't beat that! Started off with the crab rangoons for an appetizer...soooo good! We ordered a pineapple curry & a green curry, both with chicken. The curries themselves are very flavorful...not my absolute favorite in the city but still very good. Large pieces of chicken when I am used to smaller slices. They give a huge portion of rice with each as well. Be careful with the spice levels! We both enjoy spicy food but decided to take it safe given this was our first time, and each went with a 5 (out of 1-10). It was extremely spicy and almost hard to eat. Good, but crazy hot! I will go with a 3 next time most likely."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff-had the red curry and my wife tried the pad Thai. Food. Was quite tasty but heat (temperature) was just not quite there, which kinda bothered me. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Well they're not Nicky Thai. Stopped into this dimly lit place on a Friday for lunch and ordered the Thai Rama Chicken. I waited over 40 minutes for it to arrive. It was good but not worth the wait. Save your time and get a super quality Thai dish at Nicky's or Chile Noodle Corner in town."}
{"text":"We're on a family mission with our girls to explore all the Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. Little Bangkok in the Strip on Penn Ave. was Sunday's choice and what a pleasant surprise it turned out to be! 

Everything the 4 of us ordered was delicious! We started with fresh spring rolls with 12 pieces on the plate. Nice size serving and tasty. 

I loved the Pad Kra Tiem with a flavorful garlic and pepper sauce over lots of veggies with seafood. Mussels, shrimp, scallops and calamari in that delectable sauce. Call me happy! 

My hubby ordered the Pad Kra Pow, a basil sauce with chicken and topped with 2 over easy eggs. There was some yummy sampling back and forth with both our dishes.  

The girls ordered Drunken Noodles and Drunken Fried Rice, both with tofu. Both loved the flavors and although the names sounded similar, they were very different and each tasty in their own right. They're pretty picky on the preparation of their tofu and both were very pleased and their entrees were large enough to take a lot home.

There are some unique and delicious flavors coming out of this Thai kitchen and I'm looking forward to going back again very soon!"}
{"text":"I love Little Bangkok! It's my favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. The atmosphere is modern and quiet. Very friendly staff and I never had any issues with our service. Go here!"}
{"text":"Flavors were all great but preparation wasn't. Both of my dishes were served lukewarm and with stale rice. Honestly felt loke like ingredients were just stir fried for 10 seconds then served. Would probably not come again especially with Nickys nearby. Service was good though- very nice people."}
{"text":"Very well-prepared and economically priced! The BYOB factor is huge too, if you like a toddy to cool your tastebuds with a spicy (or not too spicy) great Thai dinner. Waitstaff very cordial and accommodating as well. Definitely go back again, and again."}
{"text":"We got take out, Panang curry and pad thai. We got level 6 spicy, it was spicy, but it didn't feel like a level g6. The food was still really well done, I just wish they gave more than one rice for two entrees. Would definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"It was election night. I had another concert to attend at Altar Bar. My second gig in just a few nights, Corrosion of Conformity was headlining...

There was an Asian restaurant a few blocks from the concert venue that I kept forgetting about, one that was named after Thailand's capital city...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35uzmOw1EfY

After locating and entering the establishment,  I found a small table for myself,  ordered up, took in the mystical decor, and engaged in a pleasant chat with the waitress about my evening plans as I awaited a dish I had never before eaten.

Pad Kra Pow: It sounds like the name of a mythical dragon...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ST-89.jpg

On a mountain of rice came bell peppers, minced chicken, a punching, pungent \"basil sauce\" and the greatest fried egg ever prepared. 

I'm not exaggerating about the egg, the main attraction, the guitar hero of the band if thou wilt. The edges were brittle like potato chips, the yolk was hardened, and the rich flavor indicated peanut oil perhaps, but all I could think of was an alternate Earth on which I had been introduced to eggs in this style and learned to love them much earlier in life than I did. 

Crispy eggs? I don't know if I can eat them any other way now. If throwing an egg onto every dish is a trend, I hope it doesn't die a quick death. The chicken, veggies, and sauce were all very tasty, but damn it if that simple egg, one that enveloped the entire top of the heap, didn't purloin the program from everything else on the plate.

And I went with a 5 on the spice level. Go on, snicker. With my acid reflux, I must be cautious, and besides, since when is food an exercise in masochism? Must all other flavors be overpowered by pain? Isn't food supposed to be pleasurable?

{"text":"Excellent Thai.  

Just opened this week so not real crowded, but it will be.

Started with some soup with scallions and rice, very good.  Ordered the Green Curry which is a curry paste with coconut milk, eggplant, bamboo shoots yellow peppers, and order it with shrimp (other options are pork, chicken, veggie..probably more).  All very fresh, tasty, cooked perfectly and delicious!   Spice is rated from 3 to 10.  Had it 6 (my usual) and it was very spicy and flavorful.  A ten must be unbelievable.

The restaurant is small with a minimalist decor but nice.  

The Chef, Penny, came out to greet the tables.  She gets most of the produce from the local markets and only cooks the food to order, so no precooked items.  Also, it is BYOB.

For those that live downtown or in the Strip,  you have a new place U can walk to!"}
{"text":"Good food and service! Recommend! I ordered the yellow curry lunch special ! Tastes good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. The crab Rangoon are the best I've ever had! And the service is always great, everyone is so nice. Of course the location is awesome too, I love walking around the strip. I definitely recommend Little Bangkok :)"}
{"text":"Woohoo!  AMAZING Thai food in Pittsburgh.  
No need to settle for sub-par pad thai- this place is what you would get in Thailand- at a solid restaurant.

My favorite dish is the Thai Rama Chicken: chicken and vegetables in a light yellow curry with homemade peanut sauce.  It's the peanut sauce that's mind blowing.  Excellent depth of flavor, thick and delicious, and fresh peanuts with a touch of spice.

Probably better for takeout than dine-in, but hopefully this place gets plenty of local support and maybe then the restaurant itself will fill out. 

But really, the food speaks for itself.  In the best way possible."}
{"text":"If you come here you are in for a treat. The service is extremely friendly and the food is delicious. My family comes here for special occasions and when guests visit. You may have to look for parking but it's worth it for the location - after dinner you can walk around the strip district and shop, enjoy the local experience."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food was excellent.  However, I don't  have a lot of Thai experience so I am not sure if this is the best Thai food or the worst Thai food, but it was the best I have ever had.    

When ordering they ask you for you spice/heat level with 1 being mild and 10 being hot.   I've order at the higher end but didn't seem like ti was unbearably hot or spicy.    I have heard though that the number varies based on the cook, so your experience may differ."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with some coworkers.  It was my fiends last day of working with us so we wanted to take him out.  I've never been here before but a couple of my coworkers really like this place.
 We walked in at 1pm and there was hardly anybody there.  We had 8 people with us so we were easily able to get a table right away.  The lady who was our hostess was also our waitress too.  So you get the picture.  Nice lady though.
  I think the plates were a little over priced for lunch but if you like spicy food they really make it spicy for you.  So if you're into hot stuff then this might be the place for you to try out for lunch.  I like spicy food but I'm not ordering it for lunch on a work day.  So I looked around at the menu and I saw \"Shrimp\" and \"Pork\" dumplings as an appetizer.  I wasn't too hungry so this worked for me.  I have never ordered dumplings before at a restaurant but my wife made some good ones at home before.  She loves them so I wanted to try them out.
They didn't take too long and they looked good.  They gave me some dipping sauce and they were good.  You could taste the pork but I really like the shrimp in them.  Again it was just tan appetizer so it just hit the spot for me.  They weren't spicy but I wasn't expecting them to be.  You could probably get them spicier if you asked.
My coworker's lunches came out actually one at a time which was a little weird.  They got a lot of food and rice.  The ones that got something spicy really liked their lunch.  Everybody else thought it was just ok.  I liked my dumplings a lot.  
I think it's a little over priced for lunch but it is a good lunch spot in the Strip if you want something spicy!"}
{"text":"An absolutely lovely experience. Excellent service and sumptuous food. I had the red curry with shrimp, my partner had pineapple curry with tofu, and we shared the chicken satay, which came with TWO out of this world sauces - a perfectly balanced peanut sauce and one with red onion and cucumber. We arrived at about 5:30 PM on a Thursday night in July, and had the place all to ourselves, which was totally amazing given how awesome this place is. (Maybe we just got lucky since it was early. Also - parking was no problem - the lot behind Penn Mac was empty at that time of day.) Our waitress was gracious and attentive, and the food came out FAST! Just for the sake of comparison: We love Nicky's on the North Side, and I have to say that this place is every bit as good. A $25 restaurant.com gift certificate lured me in, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai. The curries were great. The pad Thai was great. Thai coffee/teas were great. Had some apps, they were great. They ask you to chose the spice level of your dish from 1-10, I had a 5 and a 7.5, and I think they were well calibrated. Good price, perfect generous portion size. Non ostentatious, casual decor. I would eat here often if I lived in Pittsburgh."}
