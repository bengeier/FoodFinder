{"text":"I want to start out by saying I'm going to give this place a second try for sure.  But if my yelps aren't honest they don't mean anything.   So here we go.

The space and view is excellent.  Great vibe and view.  The problems started with my order.   I ordered the quiche of the day and sat down.   15 min pass and they came to my table and said they were out of what I ordered.   I switched to what's left, no problem.  Another 15 min passed and I went to the front and they told me it was a very busy day and that it was almost ready.  (It was less busy than an average lunch rush at most places I have been in town.) When I finally got the quiche it was cold and blah.   I hope to try again and experience what everyone is talking about.  It stands on 3 stars for being a cool hang out."}
{"text":"The best coffee house in Madison. Great coffee, friendly staff, and amazing location right by the lake!"}
{"text":"As much as I love the space, music, and staff friendliness I can't completely overlook the incredibly inconsistent product and service. I've had both acceptable and disgusting coffee here and the staff seems easily overwhelmed. It may be that there isn't a well designed method for stocking items or the training isn't sufficient. Whatever the reason, every time I've visited- 20 odd times- they've had to run downstairs to finish a simple order, have become very behind and served people the wrong drinks, or simply were out of coffee or cream. That said, I still like it and will keep coming back. Although, to be honest, if there were other nice places to sit and drink coffee in the neighborhood, I might not."}
{"text":"Not very helpful if you don't know what you're doing. That would have been me! I felt pushy asking for help or suggestions on food or drink. 

With that said... what a fantastic little (or not so little) neighborhood coffee joint! Perfect place for a little meet up with a friend (or few).  I would recommend a visit to check out this cozy coffee shop."}
{"text":"Just lovely. 

Great latte miel."}
{"text":"We got married at Lakeside St. three months ago.  It was just wonderful and embodied the warm spirit of the coffeehouse for us, our little wedding group, and all the folks just having coffee.To our amazement and joy, everyone wanted to be with us...laptops folded up, phones off.  The community and good spirit of those 15 minutes will remain with us always. We waited a long time to marry, and struggled for that right.  No better place to celebrate it than Lakeside; great coffee, community, food and music. Love from Cookie and Katherine"}
{"text":"As everyone else has mentioned, the real draw to this place is the view and the atmosphere. It is really beautiful and calming. 

However, service is not great, prices are insanely high, internet very slow. Also it always reeks of burnt cooking oil! It is almost toxic smelling!"}
{"text":"I just love this place! The food is great, the service is so friendly, the atmosphere is awesome, love the variety of cold drinks and best of all, they now have the friendliest, coziest wine and beer bar in town!"}
{"text":"Really the perfect caf√©! Quiet, serene atmosphere with a lovely lake view away from traffic, great expertly-made coffee drinks, DELICIOUS food!"}
{"text":"Great spacious environment! Gluten free food, delicious coffee and tea. My favorite place to come to when its raining.Love the rustic feel. Wish it had more couches though. I like what they did with the basement as well. Great view of the lake. Wish they closed later."}
{"text":"Quiet coffee shop which I was looking for on a National Holiday.  The service was terrible with a \"put-out\" server that seemed she wanted to be anywhere else BUT work.  That said, to lay out specifics:
Waited beyond a reasonable amount of time (25 minutes) for a simple breakfast sandwich.  Paid for a bottomless cup of coffee and went for my second cup, to find, all three self service pots empty.
Underwhelming service experience; and the place is really cozy on the inside."}
{"text":"Inviting! A cut above! Somewhat expensive! Except for the occasional chatter of groups of knitters, this is an example of a comfortably furnished, bright coffee bar that features a relaxing atmosphere where one can read, chat, work with a PC, catch up on current events perusing the newspapers provided free of charge, or enjoy the view of Monona Bay. Except for the occasional chatter of groups of knitters, most customers quietly pursue their activities. Coffee, juices, and a number of delicious menu items are a bit expensive. Staff are always friendly and accommodating. The no smoking policy is strictly enforced on the small patio adjacent to the front entrance as well as on the deck facing a small park and Lake Monona. Overall, a visit to the Washington Hotel Coffee Room is an opportunity for a stress free, mini-vacation."}
{"text":"It's lovely, the staff are friendly and genuine, they don't use a lot of disposable items and they compost!  not to mention bottomless yummy coffee, great food and an absolutely beautiful view and vibe.  So happy to have found you!"}
{"text":"It's a beautiful, yarn-filled, warm and inviting space with enough outlets, but the coffee is a bit expensive and the wifi, though free, is very very slow (today ranging between 100-300 kbps), and fairly spotty (on and off).

It's also very bike-friendly with good racks out front and they participate in the \"Bicycle Benefits\" program (http://www.bicyclebenefits.org), so I'm happy to keep coming here, even though the wifi bothers the part of me that needs to be constantly connected.

UPDATE: I went back the next day (9-1-09) to give the wifi a 2nd chance, but with only 3 laptop users in here the download speed is 68kbps (dial up = ~56kbps). So this is really a better place for those who don't need to get on the 'nets. My iPhone with Edge access is faster.

UPDATE (10-14-09) I don't know if they upgaded their wifi, but it's 670 kbps today (over 10x faster than last month!). Of course I kept coming here because it's comfy, spacious, and I love their wheat berry salad!"}
{"text":"I like the casual feeling of this place. One magical late summer afternoon, I sat looking at the sunny bay through open windows. A gentle breeze was blowing.. In the adjoining room, a group of people were singing \"tight\" harmonies.. Lovely! 

Coffee was pretty good, but the ambience is the main draw for me."}
{"text":"Love love this place. It is within a good biking distance from campus and has a wonderful view, both on the way and inside the coffee shop. 

The lattes are a bit mild, but do try the white mocha. It was delicious!

It's a great place to study, knit (it shares the first floor with a knitting shop) or just enjoy the sunny view."}
{"text":"I have only been here once, but I plan to go back. This coffee shop has a warm and comforting atmosphere with a fantastic view of the lake and downtown Madison. Groups of knitters gather here, which can get a little loud at times. The prices are slightly higher than other Madison coffee shops, but the quality was very good. I think this would be a great place to bring out-of-towners."}
{"text":"Location, location, location.  And it's a good thing for this cafe, as the service is routinely quite annoying.  But who can get very upset when the wait is filed with beautiful views of Monona Bay.  Turns out the coffee and teas are really good, and the sandwiches and pastries excellent.  In these areas, this is a five start coffee house.  But regularly five to ten minutes to get a latte, and often longer for a sandwich is bothersome.  Sometimes they'll bring the stuff to your table, sometimes not, and it's hard to know one way or the other.  At least half the time when I ask, my favorite food is not available.  Too bad, but I still go to look out over beautiful Madison."}
{"text":"This place is adorable!  Super great view of the lake (as the title suggests), especially when the sun is setting.  

When I was there, I got a big ol' cup of tea (ginger tangerine or something like that).  I think the variety they had was by Rishi if I remember correctly.  I also tried a raspberry cream cheese croissant.  It could have had more filling, but it was flaky, moist, and delicious otherwise!  The barista let me try a sample of the coffee they brewed for the day too...it was a yummy choice from Sumatra!  I don't remember the roaster they use though :/ 

Staff was friendly and helpful.  There is a bar in the front for alcohol and a bar in back for coffee/tea.  There's lots of room for seating upstairs & downstairs.  I like that it is very open and casual; it makes it feel homey!  

When I was there, there was an event showcasing some local artists.  I love coffee shops that throw fun events and involve the community!  Yay!  Music was kind of loud for that event, but otherwise, it was a nice surprise to stumble upon. :)"}
{"text":"Great place to study on a Sunday morning--especially when they have live acoustic music! Great views of Monona bay, delicious coffee and scones, and lots of space. When the weather is warm, you can even sit out on their patio overlooking Monona bay. This is definitely my favorite cafe in Madison!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great patio to hang out on, overlooking the lake and next to Bernie's Beach. Dogs welcome on the patio, a huge plus for us."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop in Madison.  View of lake, high ceilings, wall of windows, good coffee.  I can spend all day here and it is connected to a knitting shop.  They upgraded their Wifi and it works great now.  
Only con is the price of food-bit expensive for lunch but it is tasty."}
{"text":"Absolutely gorgeous! My favorite coffee spot in Madison. The owner and staff are friendly and the coffee is really good. The coffee house has a nice vintage look. You open the door and you are right by the lake!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently bizarre!

I keep going because it's a great space to work in, but I just don't understand how this place is run. Full disclosure: I used to be a barista in Seattle, so I know a little bit about working in/managing a coffee shop.

Most days, there is a frantic woman running around in perpetual panic. But where is she going? What is she doing? It doesn't speed things along, just adds a weird energy to the place.

It took an actual, timed, 10 minutes for a glass of iced coffee to come out the other day. Oh my god. That should take 15 seconds. 

I had the worst soy latte I ever had here. The espresso was burnt (don't leave it in there for more than 10 seconds before pulling the shot!) and the milk was scorched (makes some brands bitter). 

My husband and I have started laughing about the consistently inconsistent service and apparently overwhelmed staff. The place is endearing enough to keep us coming back, but I can't explain exactly why."}
{"text":"The VIEW. The freeking view! 
And the warm vibes, big tables, good food and the view again.

Come here to meditate or study without the internet, or to chat. 
The internet isn't worth the effort, the coffee is okay but expensive, and the surrounding area is a neighborhood and not very hip. But the lighting is prime, the decor is basically my ideal, and it's usually not too crowded.

Visit the beach maybe 500 feet from the patio!

Dog, bike and kid friendly."}
{"text":"This is one if my go-to coffee shops: good coffee, kind service, and lots of table space. They have a downstairs area with a bunch if couches and whatnot, as well as an outdoor seating area with stairs leading to a small playground and beach area. If you're tired of the sometimes noisy downtown coffee joints, give this one a go.

Minus one star for $5 credit card limit."}
{"text":"Very relaxed, tons of seating, nice staff, and great coffee. My favorite coffeehouse in Madison. You can come to read, catch up with friends, take your kid out for a cocoa, or work on your laptop - you'll see all of that at this neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"This is by far the best coffee shop I've been to in Madison. It is not infested with undergraduates, there are many tables available, there are cozy couches, there is a beautiful lake view, the staff are amazingly friendly, the food is delicious, and parking in the area is achievable. 

This is a great place to work and a wonderful place to relax. I will be coming back weekly as I had an amazing first experience here."}
{"text":"Gorgeous. 

The vibe here is incredible. Beautiful wood floors combined with great character and a lakeside view of the Capitol. They recently converted the former knitting store space into a quaint heart warming bar. Nice selection of offerings too. What more could you want in the coffee shop?"}
{"text":"My favorite weekend coffee-and-studying spot in Madison. Tons of room, big tables, sunny south-facing windows on the street side, and an unbeatable view of the lake on the opposite side. Oftentimes there's great live acoustic guitar on Sunday mornings. They recently upgraded their (formerly unreliable) Wi-Fi network.

The Bike Benefits deal--50% off drip coffee--plus the bottomless cup option makes for about the cheapest full day of caffeine intake in Madison.

In the warmer months, their nice little patio is a great place to sit."}
{"text":"Math:

Food: 2. Why am I buying this food that I could make at home, remind me?
Lake view: 5. Purty!
Decorated like my elementary school: 5 for nostalgia, 3 for taste.
The glorious sensation of not just running past this place on my 3 mile loop but actually stopping to eat there: Priceless."}
{"text":"I discovered this gem with my mom one day when we were exploring the list of slow food week participants. Not only is this place homey and inviting with the knitting store, great counter staff, and nice lighting, the food (whitefish salad sandwich is to die for!) and (fruity) iced tea are quality!! Since it's on the lake, it can get a little windy on the deck, but if you handle it, this is the perfect spot to chat with a friend over a warm drink."}
{"text":"I love the location and the view.. but the service is so bad it keeps me away.    I wonder if in the employee handbook it says\" work in slow motion.. one step at a time.. make em wait\" It is almost passive aggressive ..  (the pace that they don't work.  ) I guess they are trying too hard to be SLOW food.    prices way too high for the slow service.. especially when views are free."}
{"text":"Fun place to stop for a treat right on the lake.
Good coffee, good bakery.
Service was a bit slow but friendly.
Original decor, interesting furniture pieces, plenty of room for groups."}
{"text":"Not sure if it is because it is located within walking distance of where I live, the fact that its on the water, the free wifi, the delish coffee or the off-the hook ambiance, but this place has my heart!!  The place is located on Lakeside street which the area appears to be residential then there is this area of retail right in the middle. Super cool.

Coffee in a mug-$2.23 
This is all I had on this visit but, will be back for the scones. There is an area set up with a couch, coffee table and book shelf where you can look directly out the window which overlooks Monona Bay.There are several tables out back on the deck and some tables outside in the front that face the street.  Every other Friday there is acoustic guitar and the bar serves wine and beer.  I have  yet to get down here and check it out. The coffee house is also open Wed-Sun (look up hours on website) evenings serving wine and beer. Summer Blush is only $4 a glass!!  Whoaaaa!!!

If you are taking a walk or bike ride around Monona Bay, this place is right on your way. Stop and take a break!!"}
{"text":"I needed a quiet spot to get some work done and found this place on Yelp as it looked like a good choice.  It's very spacious, and right by the lake which I'm guessing is awesome to sit outside during the summer. There's a separate room with a bar and someone was having a private party there.  It looked like a nice space to have a small party.
  
It was really quiet and everyone there was focused on their lap tops and electronic devices while sipping on their drinks.  I was really happy with my choice.  As soon as I got my drink, opened my laptop, and started working, my focus was easily interrupted from the mind numbing conversations from the baristas. 

It's okay to talk when your not making drinks, but you don't have to be talking so loud that everyone can hear you.  It was just one barista in particular that was loud.  I'm sure that doesn't happen all the time.  This was the first time I've been to a coffeehouse and was distracted by the employees."}
{"text":"Very homey setting to enjoy an espresso, coffee, pastry, et al.  Good coffee, lots of seating space. Even an old piano in the front room!"}
{"text":"So cute. Great relaxing spot. I snagged the sofa by the windows overlooking the lake. Staff was very friendly and food came out quick. Great place to drink a big latte and just chill. Lots of seating. Lots of other people on laptops."}
{"text":"Had an excellent espresso here this morning. They use locally roasted beans from wisconsin. A great vibe in a cool historic building in a residential neighborhood. A great hidden gem. If you like non chain local coffee shops this is a sure bet."}
{"text":"I recently made my first visit. I was really impressed with their large space and massive views of Monona Bay. I was there during the evening, so I didn't drink coffee, but I was very impressed with their craft beers and nice wine list. I thoroughly enjoyed my glass of cabernet.

They offer a painting class through a mobile franchise business called Paint Nite every Wednesday. An instructor leads a class painting a landscape or still life (they bring a finished version to class). Paint Nite is the same concept as those stand-alone retail stores that offer painting and a full bar, but the woman who runs the local franchise hosts classes at places like Lakeside St Coffee House and Capital Brewery (find them on Facebook or Groupon) rather than in its own retail space. Anyway, this painting thing was actually really fun. My friend invited me and I agonized over it because I thought my painting skills would be absolutely tragic. Because the instructor shows you what to do during each step, it's actually pretty easy and fun. it's also neat to witness the \"artistic liberties\" some of the other class participants take. There was a good mix of males and females in my ~30 person class and everyone seemed to have a great time.

This is turning into more of a Paint Nite review than a Lakeside Coffee review, but both are great and I am excited to return."}
{"text":"Now that my dissertation done, finally I get to write this review to let everyone know how wonderful Lakeside St Coffee House is. 

If you like to work in coffee shops, this is the place for you. As far as I know, no other coffee shop in Madison has a larger floor space and tables than here. Plus, the historical building and the cozy ambiance always gives me much inspiration. Wifi is pretty reliable. I literally write the majority part of my dissertation in this place! 

I always spend $3.43 for my bottomless coffee for the whole day. If you bring your own mug, you get double reward in your coffee card. If you're hungry, as many have noted, Lazy Jane scones are a bright spot on the food menu. 

There are outside seating with beautiful scene of the Bernie's Beach Park is in the back. You'll also find a kid play area downstairs. Plenty of group activities take place in this community space. Basically, this is a place everyone can enjoy. 

I am thankful to the crew at Lakeside. Thanks for brewing wonderful coffee to fuel my days. You are my favorite spot in Madison!!!"}
{"text":"I really love this spot, the building is very cozy and the view is wonderful, and I love walking down to Bernie's Beach after a cup of coffee!  I've never had a bad cup of coffee here, but that's usually all I order - coffee, black.  Maybe a scone, they are great.  My order is pretty basic so that's hard to screw up. :)  I am giving them 3 stars because I have tried on a couple occasions to pop in for a cup of coffee on my way to work (when I'm running WAY LATE dropping my little one off for daycare) - they are supposed to open at 7:30...well, in my experience, they have never actually been ready or open at 7:30, so I simply stopped trying to go in...it was only 3 times, the third time the door was open, I walked in just in time to see whoever was working heading to another part of the building, and then I just stood there - and realized that this person had literally just started making everything (I could hear the brewing coffee) so I walked out.  I see there are quite a few 'service' gripes on here, and that doesn't surprise me.....even though everyone has always been friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time a week ago and was surprised I hadn't come before. Great location next to a park/playground and the lake. Good sized place with seating indoors and out. Friendly staff with a good assortment of coffee, drinks and food. Got a mocha and a few scones. Scones come from Lazy Janes and were a bit dry for my liking, but good. Mocha was excellent. Will definitely be back for another visit. Might be a five star place but I need to try/see more. Definitely a great find!"}
{"text":"I was in Madison for work and happen to run across Lakeside Coffee House on Yelp. Needless to say, this will not be my last visit! Order a Turkey Cherry sandwich that came with a salad. May I first thank the establishment for having quality, fresh, real,  wholesome, and delectable  ingredients? The salad looked like it came straight from the garden and carrots were just chopped, which is a rarity these days. The sandwich was awesome. Do yourself a favor and check out Lakeside Coffee. Plus, supporting local business with this degree of talent is always a good thing!"}
{"text":"GREAT coffee and a really warm atmosphere to enjoy it in! The view of the Capitol is amazing!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Lakeside Street Coffee House a few months back by a co-worker. I read the reviews before arriving and learned they hosted a knitting night. I was sold. The location is great, there is a great view of the city from the outdoor patio of LSCH. It is well worth a trip just for that. The coffee is good and the iced tea is good. Those are the only two beverages I have had, but both were great. I typically get the iced tea of the day and have never been disappointed. I also usually get a scone, those too are good. 

While the food and drink have been good. It really is the location and ambience that do it for me. It is never crowded. Plenty of room to work alone or to meet a friend for coffee. It's welcoming, again, with a great view. There is a playground and swimming beach just out the back of the coffee house, and yes, parent's, you can take your coffee out to the beach. Just return the cup before you leave. :)"}
{"text":"My new favorite coffeeshop in Madison! It's a great place to work and enjoy the views of Monona Bay.

This place is off the beaten path and as such, I haven't seen much of a crowd on my few visits during both the weekend and weekdays. The place has a large main room with a collection of rotating art on the walls. The chairs and furniture are all mix and match which lend to the unique atmosphere of the place. In addition to that, there appears to be a children's area on the lower level and there is a nice outdoor patio as well. If it's a warmer day, you can enjoy your food at Bernie's Beach which is right between this coffeehouse and the lake. The noise level was rather quite inside during my visits, expect for when their was a live musician performing in the adjacent bar area. The mocha I ordered had a nice velvety taste, I would order it again."}
{"text":"One of the hidden coffee shop gems in Madison. Great and quiet vibe. Spacious and eclectic. Beautiful views of the water and Madison. 

Great coffee and drinks. Vanilla latte is fantastic."}
{"text":"I happened upon this place while in town for my friend's wedding. Oh, how I wish I knew of this place while I lived here! Gorgeous view of the lake and city skyline, good god, strong coffee, ample outlets.

My only compliant is that it's quite loud. The acoustics make it seem louder and busier than it is. It won't stop me from coming back, but it did bother me."}
{"text":"We hosted our post-wedding brunch here and it was fantastic. Kate is a pleasure to work with, and she decorated the tables with nice white tablecloths, fancy serving-ware, and it looked really nice. We asked her to make a special espresso-based coffee drink, and it turned out excellent. I highly suggest for special occasions!

I also come here frequently for working, hanging out, etc., and the place is wonderful, and typically just full enough to have a good ambiance. Nice vibe, a few different types of spaces (outdoor, indoor, bar area, main room) and has a lot of character. The coffee and snacks are also great!"}
{"text":"Classic Madison style coffee house. Great coffee, some art on the walls for sale, overpriced food that comes in small serving sizes, excellent service, good wifi, and very convenient  location. A good choice if you are in the area and need a quick pick me up or to get some work done. Great view out the back."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Love the atmosphere and the BEAUTIFUL view--amazing in both the summer and the winter. The lovely folks who work there suggested a very nice green tea that I enjoyed sipping on while reading in front of the great view. Cozy, happy, wonderful.

My only qualm is that I like having salty snacks, and there aren't any great salty snackables (lunch items, but I just wanted something to munch on like salted nuts or a small soup). Lots of baked goods that look delicious though!

You could definitely do some work here too--abundant tables AND free Wi-Fi!"}
{"text":"I love it here. I adore it, I can only imagine how beautiful the view is come summer. Stopped by for lunch with some co-workers and fell in absolute love with the creaky coziness of a historic building, the huge windows toward the back looking out over the lake and a very nice green space for sitting outside once warmth comes calling again. I can only imagine early morning coffee sipped here mid July when even the dead of winter is inviting. 

The food was perfect! I ordered the smoked chicken sandwich with cheddar and cherry cranberry chutney with a side of greens. Easily one of the best tasting sandwiches I've had. This coffee house works with Pecatonica Valley Farms. The smoked chicken is from the Carr family, And the barista left a panda bear in the foam of my delicious mocha (coffee supplied by True coffee roaster) complete with a bamboo branch and leaves on the side! I wanted to take a picture but I refrained given my co-workers don't fully know my crazy. I could easily get lost in a book in this cafe. 

I was impressed."}
{"text":"This adorable coffee shop has a great view of the lake, lovely decor, and friendly baristas. One of my absolute favorite places to hang out. Only downside was they are not open very late."}
{"text":"Lakeside Street Coffee is by far my favorite coffee shop in Madison, for several reasons:
- gorgeous views of the lake
- it's a large space--there are so many places to sit and work (couches, tables), both inside and out on the patio
- the decor is cute and eclectic, and the vibe is very homey
- they have a variety of food options, in case you want to eat a meal while you're there--their vegetarian sandwich, the Asian peanut tofu, is great

The only complaint I have is their hours--they close at 7pm most nights, which is earlier than I would like. Otherwise, though, I *love* Lakeside!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great views and a cozy feel."}
{"text":"Great space in winter or summer.  Delicious, home-made drinks and foods.  Easily the most relaxing coffeeshop I've ever been in."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Being directly behind Bernie's Beach gives this place wonder views of Monona Bay. The decor is warm and inviting.  The menu is a tad small, but for bunch I had quiche and a pumpkin chai latte. The quiche was adequate and the latte was good. The mixture of atmosphere, good food and great views is something I'm sure to return for."}
{"text":"What a lovely, sunlit place to enjoy bottomless coffee and delicious food. My personal favorite is their sun-dried tomato quiche. The sandwich plates are enormous and made to share. Staff is efficient and friendly. Order at the counter, then settle in and your order will be brought to your table. Great food, service and plenty of tables-- no feeling that you need to rush out the door in order to free up a table. Finally, the view of the lake can't be beat. (There is a nice terrace area if you prefer to eat outside during the warmer season.)"}
{"text":"The staff was really nice! The inside is spacious and clean. The view of the lake is gorgeous and the coffee was delicious and fairly priced."}
{"text":"The fact that I came to Lakeside St. for the first time on a horrible, rainy spring day and STILL thought it was absolutely gorgeous is sayin' something.

It's a coffee shop. It's a bar. It's a music venue. It's a common spot for knitters (?). It's a place to grab Lazy Jane's scones and sit in the sunshine by Monona Bay and be happy you live in Madison. It's everything you want from a little lakeside cafe (and more)."}
{"text":"This place is what Madison is all about.  This place is so homely and such as quaint little coffee shop that is located on the lake.  I didn't stay long, but I had a green tea and walked around.

First of all, it was filled with people on their laptops, doing home work, chatting, and some kids downstairs playings.  This place just had such as great vibe to it that it made me what to just sit there and hang out.  

Overall, a great place on Lakeside to get some tea, coffee, or wine/beer and just chill."}
{"text":"Best pumpkin spiced latte in the city.  Delicious!   It was a bit pricey, but well worth it.  If you want cheap coffee then there's always a barfy McDonald's close by. Really nice atmosphere and its right near the lake.  Very warm and inviting."}
{"text":"This rustic homey feeling coffee shop is unassumingly located off the south shore of Monona Bay. From the seating arrangements to the lake views to the menu and baristas, it gives off a very hip vibe, which is a good thing. Came here to work on some writing and it proved to be a good environment for that. There is a large variety of different seating types and environments, you can sit outside, in a large room near the lake where the service counter is, downstairs, or in the secluded room nearer the road. The staff was friendly when I was there and the iced coffee with light caramel flavoring was excellent. There are plenty of outlets for plugging in your electronics and it wasn't very loud at all, perfect studying environment. From the outside you wouldn't think it but this place can get pretty packed. Bathrooms are decently well kept up but there is only the one gender neutral one. Didn't try any of their food options but they sounded good. One downside is they were out of soy milk when I ordered and they offered no discount or suggestions in place of that"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome little gem that I came upon today.  It's tucked back in the Bay Creek neighborhood with a fabulous view of Monona Bay and downtown.  Not to mention great coffee and a good vibe."}
{"text":"I decided to try out a local coffee shop, instead of a chain coffee shop like Starbucks. This place seemed to have pretty good reviews so I decided to try it out. I'm an iced coffee person and was a little disappointed with their array of options for iced coffee drinks. They had cold brew, iced lattes and iced mochas. I believe that was it. I ordered an iced vanilla latte and asked them to do just do half the sweetner as I wasn't sure how sweet they made their drinks. I ended up having them put 3/4 of the original amount of sweetner in my drink, and it was perfect. My only wish was that there were more options for iced coffee drinks.

Update: I decided to go again today to see if they could maybe make an iced coffee drink that wasn't on the menu. I asked them if they could make an iced carmel machiatto. They said they only make the traditional machiattos with 2 shots of espresso and foam on top, but if I wanted a machiatto that had more espresso in it, I could order an iced latte and add another shot of espresso, so I tried that, but didn't reduce the amount of sweetener in the drink. It was pretty good. I got more of the espresso taste, and still didn't have an overly sweetened drink like you get at starbucks! It's not as expensive as starbucks too, but it is on the expensive end for coffee. I paid $4.69 for my coffee, and it only comes in one size. I think it was probably about 12 ounces of coffee. Nice atmosphere!! Will come back to enjoy a coffee and enjoy the lake views! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Quality of espresso drinks depends on the barista working on the particular day. The iced red-eye (my favorite summer drink) was perfectly done on my last visit. But I've also had a shocking bad double-shot espresso, too."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of going to many events at the Lakeside Street Coffee House. The staff is always friendly and they have gluten-free? beer! The beer situation is a big deal for me since many places do not stock gluten-free? beer. The decor is interesting and eclectic. Parking can be a hassle if you are attending an event so plan to get there early."}
{"text":"The most adorable coffee shop. Also far away enough from campus so it isn't packed with a bunch of obnoxious undergrads (and I can say this since I, too, am an obnoxious undergrad). Perfect place to sit and read a book, study, get some work done, etc. I LOVE the bottomless coffee option and they also make a mean chicken coconut curry soup."}
{"text":"Love this place but for the love of it please clean! Clean the ceiling fans I've never seen so much dust! I can't even fathom you turning those on and that flying around. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in the Madison area, I try to go to Lakeside Fibers. I usually have non-yarn-crazed people with me, so The Washington Hotel Coffee Room is a great alternative for those waiting for me as I peruse the yarn shop. Combined with Lakeside Fibers, it's also a great place to hang out and knit or read or surf (they now have WiFi). There is a great view of Monona Bay and the Capitol. The location is by some railroad tracks in a somewhat residential area. This block does have some quaint little shops that add to the neighborhood. Since I am not from the area, I really appreciate the local food & products they offer. I have been coming here for a couple of year now & it's always a nice break from my road trip. The employees are always nice and helpful. I always want to stay longer when I shop here."}
{"text":"Lakesiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide! 

Bumping these fine folks up a star because they carry an assortment of Lazy Janes scones. (Need I say more!) They also have free WIFI and take credit cards, not the case and my fave scone hang on Willy, so IMO they're sort of like a Lazy Janes on crack. They have all the charm with a few less food options, but everyone's pref for pastry! 

It's also lovely to sit outside on the deck this time of year and the internet extends out there!"}
{"text":"First, this is a super cool building.  They have a big area downstairs, and board games available to play. Secondly, I did not order coffee, or even a drink from the extensive tea offerings.  Maybe if I had ordered one of these drinks, my review would be better, but for the food and service I got, it was only ok.  The staff seemed very disorganized and confused, like it was everyone's first day.  I ordered a Thai peanut tofu sandwich, and they were out of salad, so I got the other side, which was plain potato chips.  The sandwich wasn't bad, but it didn't have a Thai flavor, taste like peanut, or tofu.  I still can't describe the flavor...And the baked goods are not made on site, soI did not expect to pay over $3 for a stale chocolate croissant.  I would go back with my computer, and order coffee, but I won't waste my money getting the food again."}
{"text":"I went here a few days ago, and got some pretty stupid service... I said \"could you please rinse my mug and fill it with coffee post haste?\"... and she asked me what I wanted to order. COFFEE, NOW, FIRST? So, eh, annoying. I did order a sandwich, and asked if they had any tomato or onion to put on it. Nope. Not one tomato in the house? That's a bit tragic for a place that makes sandwiches. The side salad was pretty tragic, too. The whole mess was overpriced; it seems that they've raised their prices. I like this place, but they're losing it... opening up into Lakeside Fibers may be stretching their efforts thin. AND WHAT IS THAT BAD ART? A SMILEY FACE ON A CANVAS? FOR FUCK'S SAKE IT IS HORRID! In conclusion, they should hire better staff and get some dang onions and tomatoes."}
{"text":"This is *the* best coffee shop to go in Madison, especially if you just want to sip your warm coffee/tea/etc.,  and work/read a book/catch up with friends. It's not too modern or expensive like some coffee shops in large cities nor is it like your average Starbucks with no local charms. 

The atmosphere is perfect! The place is organically, not purposefully, rustic. It has an old cabin vibe, but not falling apart. The place reminds me of slightly worn-out, but cozy and comfortable lake cabins you see in movies. It has a gorgeous, picturesque view of the lake. The place is spacious. Also, they hold many local events here and some locals come here to knit or do other crafts together. There is a worn-out piano and a couple times, I could hear people play. The baristas are always nice and friendly. The wifi never disappoints. The noise level is about average, what you would expect from a coffee shop around town. The coffee and other drink items I tried so far are great, but I'm not picky about my coffee.

Lakeside is my go-to place to grab coffee, sit near the tables or the couch facing the lake and work or catch up with friends. I would enthusiastically recommend this place to everyone looking for a coffee shop."}
{"text":"Its got great views, great drinks, a wide selection of sandwiches, and last but not least a fantastic view of Lake Mendota the moment you walk in the door."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! What a beautiful gem right in the quiet lakeside neighborhood. Took my parents here at 1 on a Thursday afternoon. Was about 20 people there but plenty of room for triple that. Was blown away by the interior space and decor. Very homey. The staff was extra helpful when bombarded with questions about the intricacies of the menu (thanks mom). If I lived nearby I would surely make this my go-to hang out spot for coffee and a book. LOVE LOVE

Update: knocked a star off because I got a bAd Ruben sandwich around lunch rush today. Slow service was to be expected, but the sandwich was one of the worst of my life. Dense, over toasted bread (and small) with meat and kraut that were both 40 degrees. Pulled right out of the fridge and didn't heat it at all. The cheese was a solid, cold slice as well. Total disappointment, especially for $10."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a sunny Saturday with two 9 year old girls in tow.  The barista never blinked an eye as the two ordered caramel lattes.  Once they were safely out of earshot, she thoughtfully asked if we'd like her to go lightly on the coffee in those--absolutely!  Although we were new there and needed a little time with the menu and to understand they don't sell diet Coke, she kept her friendly and helpful demeanor.

The patrons didn't seem to mind the kids' chatter (we didn't get any of \"those\" looks).  The place was so friendly and welcoming.  The food (had a grilled cheese sandwich) was tasty and came with a large fresh side of greens.  Free ice cold water as well.  

The view is beautiful, looking out over Monona Bay.  I would definitely go back again, realizing how comfortable and pleasant the place is."}
{"text":"The food is average, but the atmosphere is unbeatable and the coffee is customer refillable. Lakeside is a comfortable, laid-back, ideal destination in which to chill, read a book, catch up on email, or chat with friends. Its big windows look out on a little park with the lake just beyond, and it's got three big rooms in which to find your best table for repose, plus an outside deck space if the weather is nice. I've been coming here for years to avail myself of their $4 bottomless cup of coffee, the occasional cookie, and the more occasional breakfast sandwich, quiche or salad. As I said above, the food is not the draw, but it is certainly serviceable.  Lakeside is about as good as it gets for coffee in Madison."}
{"text":"Not the best coffee but they have lots of seats and a good view of Lake Monona. Nice place to work on your laptop or simply read a book."}
{"text":"great coffee with an awesome atmosphere. Great views all year round"}
{"text":"Lakeside Street Coffee has that grandma charm with a century old house that has as much character as the many antiques, baubles, and knick-knacks it carries. Some notable features that make this location one of my favorite places to study:
- gorgeous view of the lake
- plenty of seating space
- free WiFi
- BOTTOMLESS COFFEE ($4)

This place also seems to have musical performances and serve alcohol in the evenings as well. Definitely something I hope to check out soon!"}
{"text":"it would be really hard to beat the view at Lakeside.  On a random Thursday morning, working from here was really pleasant.  Echoing other reviews, there is lots of floor space and tables, so unless there was a rush, you should be able to find a cozy spot.  If you are lucky enough to get a spot by the windows, all the better."}
