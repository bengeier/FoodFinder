{"text":"Had lunch here for the second time recently and it was as delicious as the first.  The quiche was good, but the Black Forest salad was the star with the ginger snap dressing.  My wife had a good roast beef and cheddar melt with perfectly crispy sweet potato fries.  We will definitely be back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"We WILL be back....  Last Wednesday evening my wife and I decided to try something new.   We used Yelp to find the Maestro.  Sounded fun.   It is located in the heart of Pineville downtown located in an older house.  When we arrived we were greeted with a smile and escorted to our table.   It just so happened that the restaurant was nearly empty.    We sat down and reviewed the menu.   SO many great options.  I ordered the rack of lamb and she the Filet w/ Black and Pepper Blue Cheese.    The food was unbelievably excellent.  From the presentation to the taste.   We are a bit of Filet snobs but even our own cooking is not to be compared.     I was full but knew after tasting the dinner and reading other reviews that I needed to try the dessert.    Another WOW.   I ordered the chocolate torte.  I only finished half due to the richness.     I have no idea why the restaurant was so empty that night but it was magical in every way.  Thanks - Kurt"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  This is one of the best in Charlotte. Food is fantastic. Pam is terrific. Worth every penny. Definitely a must try. Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"We live about 15 minutes away. Went there last month for the first time and had no problem with either the food or service, although the drinks are skimpy. Pam, the co-owner, came to our table, introduced herself and was very welcoming.  This past Wednesday, I called and asked Pam for a 6:30 reservation for that Friday night. She was offered 6:15 or 6:45. Since my husband wasn't home to discuss this, I asked if it could be left at 6:30. After much wrangling, Pam finally said she could \"fit us in.\"  When we got to the restaurant at 6:30, it was practically empty! Pam never came near our table the whole evening, although she was moving to every other table and talking to patrons.At the end of the meal, we gave the waitress a discount coupon. When she came back with the bill, she said that it was only good Tuesday or Thursday night, but Pam would give us the discount anyway. This is odd because we presented an identical coupon on our first visit on a Frday night and had no problem.   It was pretty obvious we were being snubbed and given a hard time-over a reservation issue in a half-empty restaurant! The entire incident was very bizarre. The food is OK but not worth the hassle. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is one of the only non chain restaurants in Pineville and it is wonderful. In an old house on Main Street they serve steaks, seafood and pasta. I had the beef Wellington and it was cooked perfectly! My wife got a seafood pasta and enjoyed it very much. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was very good- the she-crab soup and fresh green salad with cherries and goat cheese delicious- we aka had scallops and chicken which were very tasty- the problem is the air conditioning- the window units just didn't cut it and eating dinner in 90 degree heat was just uncomfortable- the chef knows his business - and food was priced well and served beautifully- I get the feeling they don't have much business because the wife/co-owner was our greeter and server - while this little gem could be a brilliant jewel - it needs proper air conditioning and some music - and to get the word out once it does!  Since it was slow it would have also been nice to meet the chef!"}
{"text":"I had been wondering about Maestro's Bar & Bistro for quite some time... but it was an UNKNOWN and easier to go where you KNOW what to expect. However, this was the year that the request was made to look beyond our usual choices to celebrate the PAIR of birthdays shared in close proximity by the wives in our foursome that dined at Maestro's Thursday night, Sept 10th. Maestro's is JUST OFF Main Street in Pineville, NC... a street travelled daily by hundreds of people who JUST MAY be unaware of the gem just 100 yards up Johnston Dr.  We drove past the white frame house and entered the drive access to the private lot located at the rear. \"Based on curb appeal... you fellows did good so far tonight!\" (laughter... and a silent prayer!) We had a reservation for 6:30PM, and were only slightly late due to a highway delay that lasted about 10 minutes and then dissolved into a mystery as traffic resumed normal flow.  Pam greeted us cheerfully and took us to a quiet table toward the back of the bistro in a room with a fireplace for atmosphere... while still comfortable thanks to the A/C. We were told about the daily specials and that there were TWO Beef Wellington's available (without the 4-hour pre-order notice)... we began PLEASURE READING of the extensive menu that offers quite a variety of choices. Note: I strongly recommend checking the online menu before going to Maestro's... the on site menu is much the same (but different listing order) and choosing will be easier IF you are already familiar with the regular offerings.  Quickly we received our water, drinks, rolls/butter, AND a sample of the WILD MUSHROOM SOUP. We ordered appetizers... so many tempting possibilities... we chose the Fried Oysters with SPICY Aioli and the Crab & Cheddar Flatbread. Both of these appetizers tasty and a good start for the four of us. The ladies liked the flatbread more than the oysters.   When the appetizers were brought I also ordered a cup of the mushroom soup... if you like the thyme-complex seasonings of German cooking & mushrooms, you would enjoy this soup very much. I agree that it is \"to die for\" but will concede that it's not everyone's taste.  Our four entrees selected were as follows: Beef Wellington Med Rare... (cooked exactly as ordered) The \"World's Largest\" Crab Cake Special (as advertised & almost no filler) Spinach Ravioli (with parmesan and Ricotta) And Salmon Med Well (delicious ravioli & marinara with a nice 6oz portion of salmon) Spinach Ravioli and Grilled Shrimp (four tender grilled shrimp, large not jumbo... very good but 5-6 would have been nicer since the premium was more than for the salmon addition. Next time I'll choose the salmon or a different entrée.)  Desserts: Special Cheesecake of the day... Key Lime... graham crust, layer of plain cheesecake topped with a layer of GENUINE Key Lime (hard to beat REAL Key Lime desserts)  Crème Brulee... PERFECT... a light creamy custard topped with a RICH DARK sixteenth inch caramelized sugar crust that breaks like ice & two flavored sauces on the side (personally I like the straight vanilla custard & thought the mango detracted some, the strawberry was OK but IMO unnecessary to enhance something already perfect)  On the way out... after we had sat around enjoying dessert & coffee for quite some time & celebrating with the birthday girls... BOTH ladies expressed satisfaction with the evening & the choice of Maestro's! (WHEW... always a reason to worry when it is their special day!)   In fact, both said our supper club group (four couples) should come to Maestro's in December which is an off-month for in-home dining to add to our Christmas festivities. Later my wife also said we should go again soon with another couple that are close friends.  It was an excellent evening... service was attentive and Pam could not have been more gracious. Maestro's is just a bit more pricey than some close rivals that we have in our rotation of regular dining locations, but the quality of the food & the variety make it worth the extra splurge now and then.  For those who like to dance around the entrée section and have a DIY meal, a possibility: Grilled Shrimp Skewer appetizer, cup of Wild Mushroom Soup, a salad, and a dessert! Hmm?  Now for a \"just me\" picky inconsequential criticism... for a fine dining restaurant with this amount of charm & curb appeal, with this high a quality of food service... the table cloths SHOULD BE CLOTH... or as my mom would have said: should not be \"oil cloth\" in a fine restaurant. We will all agree to overlook this and never mention it again so long as Maestro's food and service stay ELEVATED a bit higher than expected.  Entrée prices range $20-40 which overlaps 2 price points in the scale $$/$$$. For those who NEED GLUTEN FREE options, Maestro's has more such options than I've seen on most menus in the area... and several items are marked that they CAN BE MADE gluten free on request!"}
{"text":"Most charming restaurant I've been to in a long time.  During that lull between Christmas and New Year's I was looking for someplace different to take my 20 year old son to lunch.  As we had an errand in Pineville I searched that area, and I'm glad I did!  Maestro's is in a cozy house just off of the main street in Pineville.  The decor was warm and inviting with lots of natural light coming through the windows in the area at of the back of the house where we were seated.  I had the mushroom soup (delicious!) and my son had the lobster bisque (equally declicious!).  He had the Oyster Po' boy and substituted the BLT salad for fries.  I had the Fried Flounder sandwich with a BLT salad.  Both meals were outstanding and showed attention to detail.  The BLT salad was flavorful and fresh, and the sandwiches were perfectly prepared (we were both eyeing each others' meal! :) )  Service was also great--we enjoyed talking to Pam (one of the owners) and reading about the story behind Maestro's.  I've already recommended to friends.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a find!  From the brown sugar pecan crusted Brie with raspberries, creamy wild mushroom soup, to flourless crabcakes in a Dijon sauce and then the beef Wellington!  Everything was perfect.  Clean, classy to casual atmosphere in what appears to be a home at one time.  All this in the middle of the quaint City of Pineville.  If I lived here I would be back often."}
{"text":"Unexpected find while out shopping!  We stopped for lunch mid-afternoon based on the great Yelp reviews and we are glad we did.  The food was fantastic.  The owner recommended the Black Forest salad as something unique to their menu. The flavors were terrific -- loved the ginger flavors in the dressing.  We had quiche and a salmon sandwich.  Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious.  Nice atmosphere in an older house."}
{"text":"WOW...hidden gem in Pineville...who knew?!?! I guess many after reading the reviews today. I 'happened' in here on a whim one night. I dropped my kids off for a movie at the mall and began to just drive the area looking for anything except a chain or fast food restaurant which are a dime a dozen in this area. About to give up I saw this little building partially hidden but it looked interesting...what a pleasant surprise. A little quiet and full of 'dates' and couples so I decided to park myself at the bar, have a glass of red and eat there. I have to say I would NOT have expected the level of culinary satisfaction I experienced but I have to give it to them...they did not fail. Return? Heck yeah. Refer a friend...thats what I'm doing now. Make the trip and enjoy the flavors."}
{"text":"This is a great little family owned place.  Sat out on the patio surrounded by flowers.  Hubby had the mussels which he said were delicious.  I had a turkey panini with sweet potato fries that were both yummy.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cozy place to relax  with great food and service this is it! This is the best kept secret in South Charlotte. Not for people that are in a hurry."}
{"text":"This Chef was trained at the Culinary Institute of America and it shows!! Our table ordered a variety of foods and all were excellent! This is a truly gourmet experience where you feel like you have come to your grandmother's home...if she were a 5 star chef!!! All of the food was very fresh and the quality of the meat was outstanding!!! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Have made three trips with different people covering lunch and dinner with no repeats on the menu so far. Here is what I have learned: All desserts are chef made. The specialty cocktails are exceptional and they don't mind sharing recipes. If they make a recommendation - you should order it because they have already told you why they recommended it. Here is what you won't find: Music you have to talk over and my favorite; they don't seat diners on top of one another. A wonderful restaurant to enjoy  a romantic dinner or have a pleasant conversation. Not in a rush ? Just say so. You're the boss.  What a refreshing experience!"}
{"text":"Restaurant has closed  Best Gluten Free restaurant in the area.  Quality of the service and food is consistently first class.  Comfortable atmosphere in a large white house remodeled for the restaurant; this is not a chain.  The husband/wife team, chef and maitre d', provide a very warm and welcoming experience, every time, and I've had dinner here well over 20 times."}
{"text":"Romantic little restaurant in a quiet location.  We happened upon it by accident and I was definitely underdressed but the staff said \"don't worry\" and made me feel at home.  I had the filet mignon and they let me substitute rice for mashed potatoes due to my dairy issues.   Food was awesome, everything fresh.  Full bar and great meals means we will be coming back, hopefully soon!    PS: Parking is easy since they have their own private lot in back."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Saturday for a late lunch. Caught them between lunch and dinner but we were just doing soup and salad anyway.  The soup of the day was a chicken gumbo and it was spot on! The BLT salad was great as well. The lady serving us was delightful and the decor, although a little old school, felt like a small restaurant you would find in Europe; cozy and hospitable.  Now we're excited about coming here for dinner. We'll definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Wonderful variety on menu. We had scallops and crab cake. Great portion size and value for money. Crab cake was best I have had and scallops perfectly prepared. Calamari was great.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner and Pam, the Chef's wife and owner was delightful. The spinach salad was excellent.  My husband ordered the crab cake special. The crab cake was huge and had very little filler. I had the shrimp etouffee. I'm not usually a big fan of cajun sausage but this was delicious. The chef is known for desserts but we were too stuffed. Next time! We will be back. I want to try their famous beef wellington! :-)"}
{"text":"I was in town visiting my folks and they had made reservations for dinner. I'll admit, sometimes this scares me. We were greeted and taken care of by Pam. She was great and knew my parents from previous visits. The menu was diverse and the food was awesome. I must say, I haven't seen food plated that pretty in a while. I appreciated the theme and story of the restaurant as well as the comfortable environment. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Just had martinis. Really good!  U just try the Key Lime martini - Delicious!  The owner was friendly. She was very inviting."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've ever had! My boyfriend and I came here on Valentine's Day for a special they were running: shared appetizer, soup or salad each, entree each, and shared dessert with a mini champagne bottle.   Appetizer we got was the Brie topped with a brown sugar and pecan crust , served with crackers and strawberries. It was so good!! It had a nice soft creamy inside, we couldn't stop eating it! Loved it even more with the strawberries!!    I got the Caesar salad, (didn't want to fill up) it was really good. The salad had all fresh ingredients, down to the fresh grated Parmesan! My boyfriend got the lobster bisque which was delicious. It was nice and creamy and had such a good lobster flavor!!   For the main course I got the flourless, bread less crab cake, with a Dijon cream sauce. The sauce was amazing and had a lemon zest which complemented the crab cake nicely. However, I did miss the nice crunch you get with a crab cake, but it still had a great flavor And was packed with crab meat. It was also served with mashed potatoes, broccoli, carrot slivers, and asparagus. The sides were great, and had nice flavor.  By boyfriend preordered the Beef Wellington (you had to order 24 hours in advance), but it was so worth it!! It was delicious!! Cooked perfectly! Also served with same sides.   Lastly we chose the red velvet cheesecake with a chocolate layer on top. It was was absolutely delicious, we couldn't stop eating if even after 3 courses!!   Money well spent and will definitely come back!!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! I was in town on business, looking for somewhere cozy.  Small, family-owned business, excellent food! I had a nice merlot, wild mushroom soup, beef Wellington, coffee and the lemon tart.  Everything was perfect! I would highly recommend this nice little, very personal restaurant."}
{"text":"Ditto, ditto, ditto the other top reviews.  We stopped for lunch on a very rainy Saturday and were greeted at the backdoor by Pam, one of the owners.  What a great start to a wonderful lunch!  I ordered the butternut squash soup and my wife the wild mushroom.  So satisfying that even Washington would halt their haggling to enjoy themselves, if only for an hour.  We both ordered the quiche:  I loved it but my wife likes her less dry.  We both agreed on the flavor, however.  Maybe it was the cold, damp day or the cozy cottage feel of the old house, but we felt transported to New England on an autumn day.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I did try this restaurant, and was surprised at how small and cozy it was, but got a table right away. The menu was extensive and I wanted to try maybe 5-6 entrees but settled on the veal picatta and it was delicious. Had some nice wine to pare it with and the whole meal was 1st class. When I'm back in Charlotte I'll be sure to visit again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today after passing restaurant many times. I was pleasantly surprised. The food was great! I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is literally a husband (chef) and wife (waitress/hostess) owned and operated business. I would venture to say they run it out of their home even. The restaurant is literally downstairs in a house. We were skeptical at first with the red lights and dark street, but incredibly pleased to have tried it. The mushroom soup and lobster bisque were amazing. Fried green tomatoes were also delicious. For an entree we had the veal. It was lightly breaded and mostly tender. They offer two styles to suit your fancy, marsala was what I tried and wasn't disappointed. The drink list is pretty long, mostly wine by the bottle, but still a good enough glass selection. Can't say enough good things about family owned and operated, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been looking for our new favorite restaurant and without a doubt have now found it. We ordered the beef wellington and lamb. Started with a Cesar salad that had large shaved parmasion and wild mushroom soup that was amazing. The dinner was fantastic and we absolutlety would not have a changed a single thing. This place is a MUST try."}
{"text":"I couldn't disagree more with the previous reviewer. Unfortunately they had a bad experience, but don't ever let that deter you from trying a restaurant a second time. My husband and I went to Maestro's tonight and had what I think is the BEST meal I have had in Charlotte. The ingredients were all extremely fresh and you could tell the owner puts his heart and soul into his cooking. He makes EVERYTHING on site from the hot rolls to the luscious deserts. You must try the wild mushroom soup, the baked brie and the chocolate mouse cake creme Analise. Awesome and we will go back as fast as we can. Good and different wine menu as well."}
{"text":"The food is thoughtfully and very competently prepared. Appetizers included a velvety and creamy mushroom soup. The spinach salad with warm vinaigrette was very appealing. The Etouffee had perfectly cooked plump and succulent shrimp with flavor that transcended the great depth of spice that bit but did no lasting damage. A very pretty BBQ salmon was a bit over-sauced but still well cooked and tasty. The salmon was served with a remarkably light and airy polenta.   Do not let the plastique brocade tablecloths put you off.   The solitary server struggled to make eye contact but was very helpful and accommodating while providing service to 10 tables.  Ah now for the \"Bon  Temps\" and letting them roll...DESSERT .. The chef here has won Best Dessert in Charlotte numerous times so expectations were 'Great' - so to speak.  I am afraid that if you don't like cream you will need to skip the Mile High Tiramisu layer cake. Otherwise, gather some friends and ask for extra forks.  Yummmm  It was indeed amongst the \"Best of times..\""}
{"text":"We went to eat her for their Valentines Special.  We did have reservations ahead of time and were seated promptly.  There were three of us in out party since we had our 19 year old daughter along but they made sure that we were able to enjoy a lovely evening together.  The food was great and very plentiful we all had food boxed up to take home.  I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"The food is here phenomenal. Shrimp étouffée is the best you can get outside of New Orleans. I had the rack of lamb and it was expertly prepared. Will be back again"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, this was just not a very good experience for us.  Atmosphere only gets you so far.  Fishy calamari appetizer, deduct points.  Fly buzzing around, deduct points.  Entrees were just average.  No return trip for this guy."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place. Spectacular. This should be Charlottes number one. The service was a little slow but the food made it ten times better. Desert were rich and flavorful. We had a party of five and everyone said the same thing FANTASTIC"}
{"text":"My three friends and I, all 18 or older, decided we would try out this restaurant because of all the positive reviews. However, when we entered the restaurant the hostess immediately asked us \"can I help you?\" as if we were walking in there to ask a question instead of eat a meal. We proceeded to tell her we had a party of four but instead of taking us to our table, she shoved a menu in my friends face and asked her to \"double check\" to make sure we wanted to eat there. The hostess walked away and didn't return, instead sending man over who again asked us, \"are you sure you would like to eat here?\" For the second time we told him that we wanted to dine there. He then told us to \"hold on\" and didn't return for 3 minutes, even though there were multiples tables open! We then left and will never be back."}
{"text":"This place is a true hidden gem in the Pineville area.  I have lived in the Charlotte area for quite some time and remember this place through the changes of Tio Montero, Cajun Queen and not Maestros which has been in this location for a while.  We made un needed reservations with fiends for a nice night out sans rug rats.  Walking in at 6:15 on a Saturday night I was disheartened to not see the place packed which I hoped wasn't indicative of the experience that I was about to have.  Quick glance at the menu showed that they have A LOT of variety and you can pretty much have any type of food you want.  They also have a lot of gluten free items which are prominently displayed on the menu.    I started with the Spinach Salad which was served with warm bacon & honey Dijon dressing.  It was excellent and as someone who appreciates a home made dressing, I was happy.  Reading the other Yelpers reviews prior to my arrival I thought about the Beef Wellington but don't have the foresight to order 4 hours ahead so I figured I'd order something else.  Lucky for me they just happened to have some available....I ordered it the way meat should be done Medium Rare.  It came out perfect!!  Succulent perfectly cooked filet topped with a mushroom duxelle (I had to look that up, since I'm not THAT fancy!) wrapped in puff pasty.  It cut like butter and tasted amazing, YUM!    We finished off the night with an indulgent Lemon Cheesecake that was made in house.  It was delicious, served with a strawberry sauce and the lemon was apparent in every bite.  The service was attentive, which it should be since there wasn't a crowd of people.  I'm not sure if this place needs to do a better job of advertising to get more people in but the word should get out."}
{"text":"Black forest salad and wild mushroom soup were fantastic! Service was also great! My friend had an issue with her sandwich and they fixed the problem right away."}
{"text":"Food cooked to order. Pretty tasty. Nice environment and liked the sunroom area as it was lunch. Fairly spacious bar considering the size of the place."}
{"text":"Possibly the best lunch I've ever had!!! I always see this restaurant. I'm always indecisive on what to order for lunch. Let's face it. The pickings are slim in Pineville. I work nearby so I decided to call in my order.  I walked over to the restaurant...only saw the bar area. It wasn't busy, so my food was ready in 10mins. Once I arrived back to work, I noticed my food was STILL HOT!!!! #Awesome   I decided on the house Quiche (which comes with a salad) and the Mushroom soup! Holy moly!!! Everything was amazing!! I wish more people knew about this restaurant. It's definitely a hidden Gem! The prices are great! I spent about $12.95 total on lunch. Not a bad deal!   Not sure what the dinner crowd is like, but I'm looking forward to going here again!"}
{"text":"Very Romantic!! And Best Restaurant in Pineville (south Charlotte) area.  The Beef Wellington is Amazing and the Duck was Excellent.  Also the Chocolate Mousse Cake is a must!!  Don't miss this very private restaurant."}
{"text":"Just had a delightful lunch at Maestro's!  It's so refreshing to eat in a restaurant that is all about the food, not about pre-made, chain slop.  It's hidden down a side street in the small town part of Pineville, but it's well worth the look!  I had quiche and wild mushroom soup; the quiche was delicious, and the soup was flavorful without being ham-fisted with the spicing.  The staff is so courteous, recommending things they thought we'd like and keeping my ever-thirsty husband's tea glass thoroughly filled!  And dessert...insert Homer Simpson drool here!  The creme brulee was the best creme brulee I've ever tasted!  The entire bottom of the dish was coated in vanilla bean; to me that is a sign of a quality homemade dish.  They garnish it with whipped cream and a mango/strawberry drizzle that completes the meal!  And all for only fifty calories (don't ruin my delusion, I'm sticking to that count!)  Lunch is very VERY reasonable price-wise; I'm assuming dinner would be just as reasonable.  Such a nice place for a cozy, intimate date or a huge family party.  We'll most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"THE best meal I have ever eaten in Charlotte. Came here for business dinner and will come back here again each time I visit.   The soups were out of site!  A perfect blend of mushrooms in one; a gorgeous lobster bisque that would make a New Englander wish he was home (yes - gorgeous is a perfect description).   Entrees consisted of a perfectly cooked classic Beef Wellington; mouthwatering lamb chops; and a delicious looking seafood vol-au-vent (the diner had the beginnings of a cold and did not share; but guess what one of us will have upon our return!)  Desserts were phenomenal!  The chef/owner (Kyle Burke) stopped and visited our table. Turns out he's a CIA grad, was hand-selected to cook breakfast table side for Robert Mondavi, and has won many awards for his desserts! And they were spot on! Many eye rolls in delight.   I'm not from Charlotte and not familiar with the dining scene in the area. But if it's a drive for you to get here?  It'll be so worth it you'll do it a second time without thinking."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch with the roast beef dip, and mushroom soup with BLT salad.  We are looking forward to having dinner here.  Their menu looks great"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for Valentine's Day. The only reason this review gets 4 stars is because the food was great. My steak perfectly cooked. The service was horrible. They had 1 server for 8 tables. They hardly filled up our water, the lady serving drinks was rude and they got our desert wrong. I would be willing to give it another shot on a normal day. My wife was pleased and that's all that matters."}
{"text":"I was in town for work, just for the evening and decided to stop in for dinner and a drink. I had the Malbec, the Caprese flatbread, and the wild mushroom soup. All of which were absolutely amazing! I sat at the bar as usual considering I used to bartend and the service was also exceptional! The guests in the dining room were coming and chatting with the lady who was bartending (I believe she was the owner). They were also very pleased! A bit on the pricey side, but with appetizers it can be tolerable. That's where I went considering I was using a company card. I will definitely be back next time I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today.  Tablecloth (plastic)'was dirty; hostess/waitress/owner wore dirty clothing.  My wife ordered quiche and soup.  Soup adequate but she sent quiche back because it was horrible.  No apology or interest in why she did not like it and was told she must not like pesto (she enjoys pesto.) Price removed but servers attitude very poor.  My french onion chicken was adequate at best. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem for sure! Stopped by here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised! Highly recommend this for lunch or dinner. I will be coming back for sure. Everything is made in house and the chief was won awards for his deserts. Don't pass this by, it's worth the drive."}
