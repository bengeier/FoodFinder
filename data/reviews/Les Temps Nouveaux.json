{"text":"Delicious food. I had a mushroom soup followed by the salmon and the d√©lice au chocolat for dessert. No complaints about the food. I was there for lunch and the place was packed. The service was very slow and the waitress was somewhat frazzled. I would go back but not with only 1 hour for lunch break."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a small menus choice with interesting food pairings.  My son and I had duck and chicken respectively. Small portions complete with vegetables, but very satisfying.  Nice tasteful ambiance with soft music. Traditional French."}
{"text":"This was our first meal in Montreal, and it was a good one. This restaurant serves what I'm guessing would be classified as traditional French cuisine. Because of that I was slightly nervous that I wouldn't be able to find anything without cheese; in fact, they had quite a few menu options that I could eat. I chose the salmon; it was very good! The service was excellent; our waiter was very willing to explain the dishes to us (my wife and I are English speakers). Recommended."}
