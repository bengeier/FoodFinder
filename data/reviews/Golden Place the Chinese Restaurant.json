{"text":"It's your basic Chinese take out. We've tried several different dishes and can't find much to complain about. It's all pretty good. But we haven't found anything that makes it stand out. Inside was particularly clean for a take out style place. All the workers had on matching uniforms which I thought was interesting."}
