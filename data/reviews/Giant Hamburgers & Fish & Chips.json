{"text":"For price and value this extremely well kept Burger Joint has so much to offer. The burgers are more delicious than giant, but worth every cent.  I love the Cod, Haddock, and Sole varieties as well.  I'd give it almost 5 stars but fast food will always be fast food to me."}
{"text":"Giant Hamburgers, eh?
Methinks the claim of the name to be a little bit of an overstatement.
A more appropriate name would be \"Giant Buns\", but I don't think that would draw the same crowd.
That being said, the quarter pound patties being served up by Giant Hamburgers are charbroiled nicely and are juicy and flavourful.  
Moreover, the place itself is spotlessly clean and the service was exceptional.
Besides hamburgers, they also serve up a wide variety of fish & chips (haddock, sole, pollock) made fresh and containing zero trans fats.  The seafood options definitely set Giant Hamburgers apart from most other run-of-the-mill burger joints.
So if you've got a group that can't decide on what fast food they're craving, this is the perfect place to please everyone."}
{"text":"GIANT RIP OFF! - It's really quite absurd, what occurred when I stopped at Giant. I was passing by and recognized it as an independent burger joint and felt compelled to support it. Well, BIG MISTAKE. My order, according to the prices posted overhead, totalled $7.95 before tax. When it came time for me to pay, the total had now ballooned to $8.63!!! What?!?!?!
Tax is 5%, last time I checked. How does 68 cents amount to 5% of $7.95?!?!?! I was so incredulous and dumbfounded, I actually counted my change several times to see If I had saw or heard wrong. Nope. When I enquired, the 50ish Asian male behind the counter, abruptly and gruffly replied: \"That's the tax.\" I was speechless, and I'm usually vociferous and argumentative, and litigious like a lawyer chasing an ambulance. I was so stunned, however, still thinking I must have miscalculated. I returned to my vehicle, still wondering if I had committed a math error. No, you don't require third year calculus to figure out I had been swindled. I cannot even comment on how my food was, I can't remember the food entering my mouth, all I can recall, is more money than necessary leaving my wallet. DEPLORABLE!"}
{"text":"The food wad nothing special. What I remember of this place is they gave me a counterfeit $5 as change. The police investigated and about a month later it's name changed to Giant Hamburger."}
{"text":"Basic burger, liked it, nice guy at counter. Good chocolate shake. They had fruit shakes too that looked tasty but did not try one."}
{"text":"Mos' definitely not a must-see, but I liked it here. I got a bulgogi burger, which was just sloppy. But good. Lots of meat portioned. There seem to be a lot of daily specials, my hombre got the ambulance burger: onion ring, fried egg, waffle-cut fries, bacon, cheese. While it was delicious, the burger was underwhelming: when I think about a heart stopper, I think of a giant gob of grease that is too tall to fit into your mouth. The buns and condiments are fresh. It was a little disappointing to see ketchup, relish, and mustard packets, and even more disappointing that they didn't have jalapenos. The quality of what they do have, however, is up to the Whataburger standard. Checkit."}
{"text":"you want a good poutine, go here, tried many places poutines, nobody eles really knows how to make em, I have to say giant burgers poutine is the best in the city."}
{"text":"Lost along the 17th, I drove around looking for a place to eat and  to potentially take a quick street nap (yes Calgary is still safe enough). When driving past three well-known fast food chains, Giant Hamburger caught my eye. I walked in and found the place a bit empty and it looked like it was a fast-food joint before. The decor inside was a bit kitsch, most of it were images trying to capture the 1950's diner vibe.

I ordered their bulgogi burger and was a bit disappointed. The buns were soggy which told me that it was either left in steam warmer too long or other reasons I am too afraid to let my imagination explore. Aside from this I still ended up polishing it off because the filling was that good. It tasted like a Korean seasoned brisket sandwich. Their yam fries were typical but their cajun mayo was tasty and salvaged the whole meal

The price was ok, I felt like I was better off eating at the fast food chains. But the service was very nice, they were enthusiastic which reflected on their interesting menu."}
{"text":"I went in hoping for a delicious homemade burger, but what I received was a mediocre, expensive, unimpressive sandwich. They even claim that their burgers are homemade but mine looked like a production line, formerly frozen burger to me.

Beyond that, the fries were fine, but nothing special and the service was a bit slow.

In short, it was a let down."}
{"text":"Hands down our FAVORITE fast food joint. 
Looks unassuming, I know, but wait till you taste their food!
A MUST try is the Himalayan Bulgogi burger - succulent bulgogi beef, jalepenos, cheese, tomato, lettuce, mayo. So unbelievably good, and huge!
And their fried fish and chips is a knock out!  They have different types of fish to choose from, too.
They also advertise fresh fruit shakes, but I have yet to have the room to try one. This summer I definitely have to try one though! 
My family and I go to Giant Burger every time we're in the neighborhood, and sometimes we make errand runs JUST so we can go have a bulgogi burger afterward! 
Sadly, they're closed on Sundays.
This place is SO much better than any other local fast food joint, and it's got a varied, different menu, so there's something for everyone. 
I dare you to try it and love it like we do!  :)"}
{"text":"If you're thinking of hitting up Wendy's, McD's or KFC on 17th Ave, do yourself a favour and keep driving up the hill a ways until you reach an establishment that looks like Wendy's, but is really Giant Hamburgers.

I stopped in for lunch, and I must concur that the hamburgers are not giant, but they're definitely a couple of steps above what you'll find at any major chain. I ordered myself the Himalayan Steak Burger. It was more like beef on a bun with some tasty sauce added in than a hamburger. The server handed me some extra napkins with it and said \"here, you'll need these.\" He was right, that was the messiest burger I've had in a long time.

Giant burgers is by no means a 'must-eat' establishment. However, there were some creative burgers on the menu that you wouldn't find elsewhere (like the Bulgogi Burger), and the price is on par with what you'd spend and any other fast food joint."}
{"text":"Giant Hamburgers used to be called Joey's (I think), but I heard they had to change their name and their logo, because their sign looked way too much like the Wendy's sign. I'm not sure if this place is under new ownership or not, but they seemed to have changed their food slightly since the name change. 

The fries used to be quite thick and slightly coated with flour, so that they are crispier. Now they are just regular, medium cut fries that are served in a cardboard coffee cup. They are even more delicious than they used to be. Also, the burgers are huge now, hence the name \"Giant Hamburgers.\" Last time I was here I got the chicken burger, and it was so good! It was a large breaded chicken breast cooked to perfection--not dried out at all. The toppings (lettuce, tomato, and mayo) tasted fresh too, and the bread was nice and soft. It was a bit expensive, but it was so worth it, and I was so full by the end. I also took a bite of my friend's beef burger, and it was quite tasty as well. 

I really love this place now, and I will definitely be back next time I'm in Calgary!"}
