{"text":"Whenever I'm craving some good home cooked comfort food, Angie's Soul Food never fails! Today I got the Salisbury steak dinner....it is BANGIN!!!! ABSOLUTELY worth every penny! I've had the smothered pork chops in the past and I'm not kidding when I say, I was craving them the next week so I went back and got the same thing! The mac n cheese reminds me of how my auntie makes it. Nothing but 100% pure yumminess!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and good sevice. I had the smothered pork chop dinner. MmMmM so Good!"}
{"text":"Okay, the food was just okay. The Mac and cheese tasted old and burnt but the chicken and greens was good. Now lets talk about the service. When u call in your order before u can breath she throw u on hold. And I mean throw. She does wait for a respond just PLEASE HOLD and there u sit for 3 to 4 mins. Today, I place my order. I felt rushed. She got the order wrong. Then argue with me about it. I felt she need to better handle herself with the public. I should never see your stank attitude when I'm spending my money. I had just eat there a day, ago. I eat out a lot. In today world when this happen. I just come home and start writing. Because I'm not trying to get in a heated conversation. I just want to be treated with respect and eat some good food.I will not go back for a while. Customer service is important too."}
{"text":"Great stick to your ribs soul food!   This location is in the Lee Harvard Shopping Center around the corner from Villa. The restaurant itself isn't much to look at, just a short counter and small dining room with a handful of tables but that doesn't matter because the fried chicken is amazing! It's just like Gladys and Ron's in Atlanta! It's moist and tender and not too greasy. You can get it in dark or white meat, thighs and legs or breasts and wings.   Besides fried chicken Angie's offers catfish, whiting, tilapia, perch, salmon croquettes, shrimp, beef tips, pork chops, oxtails and beef and short ribs. Some of the sides offered are black eye peas, cabbage, yams, mac & cheese, potato salad, green beans and collard greens. Everything is fresh! Nothing is canned. Their waffles are outstanding as well! The only bad thing I can say about Angie's is that their cordbread muffins are a little dry.  The restaurant itself was pretty bare. Customers don't linger either, they order their food at the counter and wait for it to be prepared then leave.   Insider tip: Make sure to ask for some hot sauce for your fried chicken. They keep it behind the counter. While Angie's fried chicken doesn't need any condiments to be savored, the house hot sauce adds a welcome kick.   Bottom line, For quick, inexpensive and authentic soul food, you can't go wrong with Angie's Soul Cafe. While you can order the same food at various fast food restaurants, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not visiting Angie's first!"}
{"text":"The food was terrible.  I had smothered pork chops and candied yams.  The yams tasted as if a cleaning agent was accidentally dropped in the pot.  If I hadn't ordered and picked up the food myself, I would swear someone was trying to poison me.  I thought I ordered the smothered pork chops but all I got was smothered gristle.  I was excited about this place.  Not so much now."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after I met the owner, Adrian.  It's just a basic, neighborhood carryout/diner place, but don't let the appearance fool you!  The menu selection is pretty wide.  The food smells amazing.  So I figured I'd try it.  I'm a huge mac and cheese fan, so I tried that.  Awesome, homemade taste, and very filling.  Great value for the money, too.  The service was good, friendly.  We're not talking fine dining, here, but the food quality is there. My second trip, I decided to try some soul food options, including the greens and yams.  Again, I was very pleased.  I'm not a soul food expert by any stretch, but I know what tastes good.  Whenever I'm in the area, I try to stop here for a quick and affordable lunch."}
{"text":"Very good food, I love getting the catfish there. Their prices are very good for the amount of food you get.   The staff is a little quiet, but attentive. I haven't tried their dessert, but perhaps I will next time!"}
{"text":"For a quick meal, it's hard to beat.  Portions are generous and service is quick and polite.  The only thing keeping me from delivering a 5 star review is the amount of SALT in the main dishes and sides.  I have worked my way around the menu over several visits and found the level of salt to be heavy handed nearly every time.  Other than that, if you are in the mood for some slow-cooked soul food, give it a try."}
{"text":"Could not take more lame chicken from a franchise place, figured a soul good joint was sure to have solid fried chicken. Angie's has it. Very good chicken, served with corn muffins & 2 sides. Candied yams, mac & cheese were delicious.  Sign next to the menu board says there's no cans here and you can taste it. Harvard & Lee might be out of the way for you, as it is for me, but worth the trip."}
{"text":"I remember going to an Angie's location years ago & I didn't like the food too much. I decided to give Angie's Soul Food another chance since my family & I were craving soul food after church & Angie's was nearby.  I ordered the chicken & waffles to go & my family ordered other dishes like the smothered chicken, baked chicken, salmon croquette, & a bunch of sides.   The fried chicken was so good! The chicken was flavorful & juicy. The waffle was light & fluffy. Since I got it to go, the waffle was a little saggy so, I popped it in the toaster. It was very good as well! It has cinnamon in it & went so well with the chicken. I sampled all the food that my family ordered as well & everything tasted good but, I liked my chicken & waffle the best.   The service was good, the employees were friendly! I'll be sure to stop by again when I have another soul food craving!"}
{"text":"Best soul food in Cleveland, great service and very friendly staff. Best to call your order in but if you walk in that's find. The dinning area is very clean and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this location in the Lee Harvard Shopping Center, not too long after flying in to Cleveland-Hopkins airport for our trip to Ohio during Thanksgiving in November 2012. The restaurant itself isn't much to look at from outside, and even inside it is just a short counter and small dining room with a few tables, an old bubble screen TV, and something that looked like a jukebox. Somehow I didn't have any doubts because when I scouted the place on yelp before our trip to Cleveland, I knew if it had many good reviews, it couldn't be bad unless something went terribly wrong this day.  We ordered our food we wanted and I would say the only thing that was negative about our experience here was the long wait for our food to come out. Even then, it was just a tad bit annoying as the food turned out absolutely great!    I had chicken and waffles for the first time in a long time. I also had mac and cheese and something else I don't remember, by the time I started eating everything, it was going down together and it was tasting too damn good for me to remember what it was. I barely remember what my wife had, but it involved some sort of smothered baked chicken which was also delicious as hell. I loved that special Kool-aid that Angie's served. It was probably the best tasting Kool-Aid I've ever had.   The restaurant itself was pretty bare. Customers don't linger either, they order their food at the counter and wait for it to be prepared then leave.   I agree with who said to ask for some hot sauce for the fried chicken that gives it a good welcome kick. I also agree that she was bargain-priced for the amoutn of food served. My wife and I were so full when we left that we probably took a nap when we got back to the hotel.   What a treasure in a non-descript part of town Angie's was. They sure know what soul food is supposed to taste like and it was so good that the next day, Thanksgiving dinner, though great at my grandma's house, wasn't quite the same...I still had the taste of chicken and waffles in my mouth!"}
{"text":"There is another location on Emery. I ordered 5 chicken wing dinner and a side of dressing. I thought I would get 2 sides+ the dressing I paid 9.58 for the worse chicken and the worse dressing I have ever tasted no other sides were included. I will never go there again."}
