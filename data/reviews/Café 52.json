{"text":"This is indeed a very nice neighborhood Cafe. Its has a nice vibe to it and looks like a perfect place to go relax and escape reality for a few minutes. Others m8ght find it perfect for work. So why did I give it an average mark? Well for me in general but also particularly in Montreal a coffee place MUST hav3 good pasteries. I bought 2 standart croissants one for me and one for a friend at work. They were so bad I was emberssed to give my friend his. It felt like I am eating a butter flavoured bun and not a crisppy croissant. I assume they buy it and do not make it them self which is more disappointing (and charging 2$ for it). I hope they step up their game since this does look like a nice place."}
