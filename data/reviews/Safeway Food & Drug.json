{"text":"I love coming here for all of my home needs. Friendly service and great staff to joke around with. I have never had a bad time in here. The only problem that I have is from time to time it is a little under staffed at 5 but what place isn't."}
{"text":"While the selection is good. Items are fresh the checkout lines are insane. Never enough cashiers. I feel that my time is NOT valued. That is offensive. Also bargain items are hard to locate. They are not in normal eye vision range. That is passive aggressive. The stores need to remember WE are the customers. Treat us with value."}
{"text":"Wow....what can I say. Went to get a sandwich at the deli over there as I have in the past. The woman working was seriously rude. Made my sandwich completely wrong and super sloppy. And she was just cranky. Talking about other customers when I was there. Terrible customer service. Hire someone with a better attitude."}
{"text":"I've shopped Safeway for nearly 30 years, both in Fountain Hills and the Arcadia location. However, I'm done with the Arcadia store. New faces who aren't helpful, where's the wine guy? Why is there only 1 slow worker at 5 p.m. making sandwiches AND servicing deli customers? Last night on our way home from my granddaughter's t ball game we stopped for sandwiches. We were \"invisible\" and left after waiting 15 minutes. I now got home and bought my weekly groceries at noon on Friday. Guess what? 1 cashier open with 8 carts lined up! The nice lady behind me asked if I would watch her cart while she went to get their attention of the line. Finally, a sweet bag boy told me to get in a new line as another cashier was coming. Well, whoever the young woman was who must be in their management position was horrible! She told me in a yelling voice from 100 feet away to NOT put my things on the conveyor belt since she's trying to find a cashier. Of course, I've now lost my place in line and very angry with her yelling. She's lucky I didn't embarrass her. However, the lady she was \"helping\" at a lottery machine didn't need to have Ms Management turn to her and talk about ME as if I weren't in the store, where do these people come from? Why a skeleton crew on Friday at noon? If I ever go back in that store, kill me. I will continue my push to upper management because they have taken a nice store and ruined it. All for the sake of bean counters thinking they can squeeze more money out of the store. Guess what, Safeway? In the Phx market, we have TONS of choices of where we spend our money."}
{"text":"This is my closest grocery store and sadly I sometimes hate it in my heart. Somedays its not too bad but most of the time something frustrating happens. Its not the employees per say (usually) but the other people who shop there.  They argue with employees, who often argue back. They let their kids run around like wild animals. Many people like to shop here in their PJs too which adds a whole classy dimension.

I find they are lacking the meat and seafood selection Superstore has which can be frustrating when I'm looking for something to make for dinner. Their produce is okay...they are often out of mushrooms though. They do have good deals on pantry items from time to time which makes shopping for lunch stuff economical etc.

Where this store really falls flat is when you have the opportunity to visit other, newer Safeways. You realize then that this is the Safeway that time forgot. Its employees seem a little rusty in customer service skills, the store is clean but run down in spots and overall it just feels like a poor cousin to other Safeway locations. I realize it is probably not Safeway's most profitable store but if they don't spruce up the look and professionalism, especially with a newly remodelled Shoppers with grocery next door, they wont be in business very long"}
{"text":"CAUTION SALES CLERK HYGIENE ISSUE

I spent an hour shopping at this location today. I went to the checkout line and there was no one was in line. Well there was Carl blowing his nose with a tissue, and sneezing. He then started to move my food over the scanner and did not take the time to use a hand sanitizer. I called a manager over name Heather. Her badge said she was the safety manager. I thought after explaining it to her that she was kind of smiling about it..... and she assured me she was not. She said she would take care of it. After, I got home, I called and spoke with another manager named Heather. I told her after I paid I addressed Carl about it and he said the money is also dirty. He also stated he cannot control what comes out of his nose. Heather did apologize. I stated he should be reprimanded and trained on using hand sanitizer. 

I am concerned that if they are this lax with health and cleanliness what the rest of the store is like. They need to get it right....and Carl needs to make an attitude adjustment and shoe more respect for customers by taking basic hygiene precautions."}
{"text":"Worst deli department I've ever been to. Nikki the women working behind the deli counter is just plain rude. Yelling at her coworkers and mumbling racial and homophobic slurs under her breath while helping customers. The deli department staff will look at you waiting for them and just ignore you. There is no self check out so you may wait in line for a while. Many staff members have poor hygiene; sneezing and blowing their nose while checking you out and touching your food. I asked a member of the produce staff if they had any more kale and he said \"what's kale?\". If this grocery store wasn't so close to my house I would not shop here."}
{"text":"I would give the Safeway negative stars if it were an option. Bobby W the \"manager\" is extremely unprofessional, rude, and ignorant. If the attitude \"it's not my job\" is what you're looking for this is the man to speak to you. Also this is the dirtiest Safeway I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Many grocery stores to choice from in the Arcadia / Biltmore area, none compare to this Safeway though.  AJ's is pricier, Albertson's is laid out oddly and not as nice, Trader Joe's doesn't always have the savings or selection and Fry's is over-the-top ( Winebar? In a grocery store?)

Courteous staff, great selection, good savings and convenient location assist me in my monthly grocery habit.  Just stocked up again this evening for under $100.  Mangoes were priced at 2/$!"}
{"text":"Well done! 
Ordered a graduation cake from the bakery last week.  The cake turned out spectacular! It looked great and tasted even better! The staff was very helpful and Linda was amazing to work with. Would totally recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for food shopping and craft beer, wine and liquor.   The store is always clean and well kept, and I like the layout of the store.  The prices are ok, there are places that are cheaper but not in this area."}
{"text":"I am SO mad at this store location today.  It is my son's 3rd birthday and I actually came into the store 10 days ago to order a Planes (the movie) themed birthday cake.  The woman at the counter took my order, my 2nd choice in case it wasn't in, and my phone number.  Nothing.  Until this morning, the day of his birthday.  I received a call saying that the cake was unavailable.  This is not how you should do business.  If the cake is not available today, it wasn't available 4-5 days ago.  GIVE A PERSON A CALL to let me know.  Luckily the Safeway on Chapparal was able to assist, and the cake was WONDERFUL!  

PS - it wouldn't let me post ZERO stars..."}
{"text":"I really like Safeway because I think they have the best selection of what I like the most..they have all the items that I need including those more rare items that Frys, Albertsons, and Fresh and Easy will not have...the people that work there are always very helpful...one time a gentleman helped me find fig spread and veal for about 20 minutes...they didnt have it at their store but they found it for me at another store...that is great customer service...they have the best produce...its the freshest and they have the best selection!  I just wish their prices were a little better...but they have gotten much better compared to about a year or so ago!  I am now starting to clip coupons so hopefully it will make it that much better!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Always a smile from cashiers. Store is well managed and always in stock. 

Great neighborhood store. Would highly recommend. The Starbucks is great. Excellent coffees and service."}
{"text":"I really appreciate the selection of organic foods and produce. They also have a nice selection of grass fed beef and nitrate free deli meats. Much better selection vs. Frys for sure."}
{"text":"The store just didn't have the basic items I look needed and it wasn't as clean as I expected"}
{"text":"Safeway is great because they always have super convenient locations, and I've been shopping there for so long, that I am familiar with the products they carry, and have developed my buying habits based on that.

However, they tend to be overpriced, and at this particular location (Dalhousie station, a convenient 4 seconds from my house) the produce is usually terrible. Old, bruised, wilting... blah. That or they just don't have what you're looking for. One day there's zucchini aplenty, the next there is none... and there remains none for 2 weeks. Same with crimini mushrooms. One day there's loads (true, they're all shriveled, but they're there!) and the next they're gone. And remain gone for 3 weeks!

I have to say the Crowfoot location of Safeway is definitely better, so if you live in between the two, go Crowfoot.

Safeway is a good place to go on the first Tuesday of every month. If you have a club card, you get 10% off if you spend $35 or more. So you can actually save a lot if you shop smart. Like buying items already on sale to get an even larger discount, or buying more expensive items like razors etc.

But frankly, if you really want to save money, Costco is where it's at. And for produce, I find that the crowfoot Co-op is usually ok.

{"text":"This is a nice Safeway in a convenient location, with plenty of parking.

They are generally stocked with all items and have great sale items. I am not a frequent shopper of Safeway, only because I don't have one near me, however that may change.

I wish they had more than one express line,since when I do go into Safeway, it always seems to be the longest line. That is the only negative to this location.

I really like their floral department in this location. They have such a variety on flowers and vases that I end up buying more than planned.

The service is always great and everything is well laid out at this location. I also like that they have a Starbucks so you can grab a coffee while you shop."}
{"text":"This location is not huge, but it's the cleanest supermarket near the house! Its prices are fair, staff are fairly nice (most are cold and distant), produce snd meat are better than the near by locations but very pricey.  Place is clean, location is convenient.  The Starbucks staff are a bit careless but that's another story.

Anyways, Safeway is great, highly recommend.

(Oh, bathrooms are filthy though)."}
{"text":"This Safeway is my go to for anything from a light snack to a whole grocery order. The staff or more than willing to help and they even have a Starbucks to get a coffee once you're all finished. Nothing bad I would say about this location."}
{"text":"This Safeway is the one in front of my church, so it's the one I frequent on Sundays to grab an after-service lunch. Unfortunately, it's also the place where my church likes to get after-service refreshments. If I have to look at another cloyingly sweet donut or cake from Safeway; the sight of which now give me Alex DeLarge-esque tics at the thought of eating them, I may-- er, sorry, tangent. Safeway pastries are gross. I hated cake for years because I thought all cakes tasted like the stale sugar bombs that come from the Safeway bakery.

The selection at this particular Safeway is decent. I can get some of the vegan-specific items here that I would normally have to make a trek to CNF for, and usually for a dollar or two less. If I'm with omnivores, they're usually pretty impressed that Safeway will slice their meat for them, saving them (and their fingers) that extra step in the kitchen. On Sundays when I've rushed out the door to make it to choir practice on time; skipping breakfast on the way, I've relied on the deli and the surprisingly not-so-bad brown rice sushi. Or the minestrone soup and a veggie sandwich with extra avocado. 

I'm glad they've managed to stick it out despite many of the businesses around them going under :)."}
{"text":"I gave Safeway five stars because the cashier had the guts to wish me a \"Merry Christmas\", not a \"Happy Holidays\". 

They also had the type of Windex I was looking for, that was nice."}
{"text":"Typical Safeway.  I think we visited during a rush because they only had one lane open and 15 customers.  By the time I grabbed my water they had opened a few lanes and my wait was much less than what i was expecting coming in.  Great service in that aspect!"}
{"text":"I love bargain shopping so I have a tendency to visit Frys and Albertsons instead, but I love the cleaniness of this Safeway and their selection of products and wine. Although their regular prices can be a little high, they do have the best weekend deals and coupons in their Wednesday circular. If you plan ahead, Safeway is definitely the way to go. I now like waking up early on the weekends and collecting my deals. It's always fun to see your percentage of savings. My goal is to one day make it about 50 percent!"}
{"text":"Price wise I felt I was at a wholefoods"}
{"text":"As far as safeways go, this is pretty standard, fresh bakery, deli counter butchery and aisle upon aisle of a vast array of products. Safeway has a reputation for being expensive, but I have noticed lately they have reduced prices quite a bit on some items. Also they often have buy one get one free...a great deal. 
The thing I like about this safeway is the spacious aisles and it never feels crowded to me. The one downtown that I usually go to can feel a bit insane, this one isnt like that.  The only thing I dont like is the security guard they sometimes have standing guard in the produce section entrance that leads to the mall, it always seemed accusatory to me... I understand that maybe they have to do this..I just never really liked it. 
. For the longest time they didnt have the self scan, but now they have followed the trend and added them.  
This is a nice safeway. I like it."}
{"text":"I don't support places of business that treat their workers like $hit.  I have known several people who worked for Safeway including this store and been treated like trash. 

Their practices are shady at best. 

Shame on Safeway."}
{"text":"Every available cashier had a lineup at least 3-deep- even self checkout had a lineup! 

I dashed in at 5pm to grab one item, hoping to dash out, but that wasn't going to happen.

Although the cashier I did have was friendly and helpful when I did reach her."}
{"text":"Open till 11 seven days a week. Fantastic. Gluten free selection, bakery wows my parents all the time with their rolls and bread. 

It's a smaller store but somehow they always manage to have good stock and selection. 

Airmiles redemption! So fabulous my cashier reminded me!! I got to spend those languishing dream dollars in food! Free cheese! Ok, not exactly, but $18 was paid with air miles."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Safeway ever since I moved to the Arcadia area in January 2017. 

I've gone to the deli, it's great. I've purchased from their wine selection, is pretty good sized. I've had some of their baked goods from their bakery, they're delicious. I've shopped for produce, it's always fresh. I've even used their florist more than once, it was a great experience.

I've shopped for just about anything you get at a grocery store here. The parking lot is shared with the entire complex so that could be packed, I personally prefer to park far away. They also just installed brand new shopping carts  which are really nice and there are no squeaky wheels yet.

There is a full Starbucks inside also. I've typically received great service here as well, minus some outliers."}
{"text":"The Sushi here is really great - which I find surprising for a grocery store. The sushi quality is much higher than AJ's and even some restaurants."}
{"text":"This is my usual grocery store stop as it's on my way home from work in the evening and just down the plaza from Black Cat Coffee House which is the best place in town for all things caffeine. Store is clean and organized nicely. The deli offers a wide selection of good quality meats. The floral section has some reasonably priced beautiful bouquets. Most of the staff is friendly, but there are a few not so pleasant associates, too. The biggest ding is that there are never enough checkout lanes open during peak shopping times. Even with the \"3\"s a Crowd\" rule (where they open another lane if there are 3 or more people having to wait in line), it's usually not put into use until 5 or 6 people are having to wait in line."}
{"text":"I live in Riverbend, therefore this is my neighborhood safeway.

I am the first to admit that compared to other safeways, this one is in desperate need of a renovation.  However, despite that, this Safeway is extremely functional and has never let me down.  

In the surrounding area of Riverbend, there are three choices to shop.  Safeway, Sobeys and as of lately, Co-op in Quarry Park.  If we want to stretch our legs a little, we also have SuperStore, Wal-Mart and SuperStore in Heritage Meadows.  That my friend, is what we call competition.

I do shop at all of them, but the reason why I choose Odgen Safeway over the others at time are for the following reasons.

1.  I absolutely LOVE their deli.  My guilty little pleasure is getting about 4 - 6 different salads and makign my own little salad bar at home.  It gives me a few lunches into my work week at well.  My neighboring delis do not offer the same choices in salads as the Deli at Safeway.

2.  Airmiles.  There... I said it. :)

3.  when I need something a little more carby, I also enjoy the plymouth rock sandwich.

4.  The safeway for the longest time had the only starbucks in the area.  Now Quarry Park offers a bit of competition if I just want coffee.  But why not couple a coffee run with picking up a few items?

Long and short of it, my only feedback for Ogden Safeway is that it will be nice when they get their turn for renovations, but other than that, I have my favorite items that I can only get there, versus competing grocery stores.  Therefore, you continue to get the lions share of my grocery business.  Nice work!"}
{"text":"This is a nice Safeway in a convenient location, but I must say it's incredibly busy a lot of the time, creating long line ups and chaos at the check-outs. 
They are generally better stocked than Save On though, and with better prices.
I generally find what I need here, though, and enjoy their selection of Tassimo and Keurig coffee pods, albeit at sky high prices."}
{"text":"This Safeway is about like all the others, but one things sets it apart of me: the floral department. While in a rush and in need of some balloons stat, I paid Safeway a visit. I went to the floral department that was filled with some delightful plants and floral creations and I asked the lady if she could blow up some balloons. Now I've been to one too many grocery stores where it can take 40 minutes to fill up balloons. It's painful to wait and watch. However, this is not one of those grocery stores! The lady was very speedy with her balloon skills and when I commented on it, she said she's had some major practice. Well, she's made a customer out of me and whenever I need balloons blown up in the future, I will choose this Safeway. My only issue with it is that the balloons are a pretty penny to blow up ($.75). I didn't realize helium cost so much! I can buy a helium tank for $29 and save money but when I'm in a rush, I'll pick this Safeway!"}
{"text":"The management are rude and treat you disrespectful. And they sell out of date products..."}
{"text":"One of the better Safeway around.  They have an extensive GF section in comparison to most Safeways.  
The store is big, and well stocked.   
The bathrooms are what you expect but always welcome to use. 
Produce is fresh. 
I know it's not the cheapest place in town but you don't have to fight hoards of people to shop.  My veggies don't wilt within days.

Good on you Safeway."}
{"text":"Open until 11pm. Great staff. Know my kids by name. Have gone on a tour with two kindergarten classes. It is a personal feeling grocery store."}
{"text":"This store has an absolutely HORRIBLE selection for organic and non-GMO produce and food items.  This store is full of pesticide-laden fruit and vegetables, hormone & pus-filled milk, and genetically-modified \"food.\"  You're disgusting, Safeway!  How can you be so proud to offer so much \"food\" that causes allergies and disease?  You offer next to nothing for the person who wants to live a healthy lifestyle!!!"}
{"text":"Deli fried chicken is decent (when you are starving) and a good deal.  This is pretty much your basic Safeway."}
{"text":"This morning I opened my fridge to a big fat empty space... and that's when I knew - time to go grocery shopping - and not just any grocery shopping - time to load up!

Sure - it's fine to go to AJ's here and there, and the Farmers Market (when in season) for fresh produce.  Sunflower and Albertson's aren't far, but for whatever reason, I chose to do my shopping today at Safeway.  

For $121, I stocked the fridge.  I won't go into the details of my purchases (grocery shopping can get really personal, you know?!) - but I will say that I came home happy.  I also am proud to say that I will be eating in all three of my meals today, and maybe snacks too.  Don't you love when you can do that?  I do!

Safeway - please work on your fresh seafood selection - there was not much there to choose from.  But other than that, I am a big fan!  I'm sure I'll see you again real soon..."}
{"text":"I usually shop at Fry's or Albertsons, closer to home. A coworker told me about a machine that allows you to trade in your gift cards for cash so I drove the extra distance to this Safeway. One of my gift cards was not accepted (it was from Arcadia Tavern), another not accepted because it was an odd shape, and a third accepted but I didn't trade it in because the machine wanted too much money for the gift card.

Needless to say, I still have all three unused gift cards in my wallet. *sigh"}
{"text":"Nice store.  Not huge which makes it easier to shop in.  But they chopped up some of the aisles and things seemed to get sorted out strangely.  I find it hard to locate what i am looking for.  But my main complaint is the dairy department.  I buy a lot of organic 2% milk because my kids drink so much milk.  They are out of the gallons about 50% of the time.  Nothing in the dairy department is ever faced up.  It seems i am constantly up to my shoulders in the cooler trying to reach stuff way in the back.  So i am over it.  Going to Fry's from now on."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this a 2 because the soup was good..  Went in on 9/21/15 to get some soup, a breaded soup bowl, corn bread and crackers for the soup.  By the way, they have pictures of the breaded soup bowls above where you get the soup!!  After having soup in hand and finally getting someone's attention behind the counter I ask about the bread bowls and was promptly told they were back in the bakery.  (I thought that was funny as the soup was up front)  Well, after looking all over the bakery I asked a woman behind the counter where they were.  Her response was, we don't make these everyday, if you want them you put in an order and you can pick them up tomorrow.  I told her I wanted a soup bowl for me, today, not tomorrow.  They had no corn bread either!!  And, there were no packs of crackers by the soup up front.  If you want to sell the whole job, you need ALL of the elements in the same place.  
I am glad the Safeway at 7th Avenue and Osborn knows how to run their deli area!!"}
{"text":"A recent experience of poor customer non-service is causing the need to post this review.  Let me state upfront that I have shopped at this Safeway for 15 years and utilize my Safeway card always. For the most part, I am satisfied with this Safeway.
This previous Friday I purchased two large bags of cherries in the event of my daughter and grandson coming to visit.  I was the first (and thankfully the only person) to eat the cherries on Sunday.  The next day I was overcome with extreme food poisoning symptoms that lasted two days.  I could not do anything with my family.
Today I took the cherries back to the store asking for a refund and explaining the reason.  The customer service person was about to refund my cherries at today's special price of $1.99 instead of the full price I paid.  I explained I didn't have the receipt because I used the bag with the receipt in it to use to pick up my dog's waste.  She kept telling me that I needed the receipt.  After telling her what I went through this week, she called her boss \"Bobby\".  
Bobby again went through the same requests, and I gave him the same responses.  I also told him I didn't expect to be buying tainted produce.  Finally he allowed the CS person to give me a gift card for the full price refund.
Never once did Bobby or the CS person ask me if I was feeling better, or ask me if there was anything the can do for me.  Shame on you Bobby!!  I will probably be shopping at the 32nd St Safeway after this."}
{"text":"This Safeway should be reported and closed down. They are cheating and stealing of customers every chance they get and staff seem to know about it too. Prices never seem correct and nothing is ever right on the recipe. I spoke to the manager right after shopping as 3 times in the raw things weren't  scanned correct. I bought 1 shampoo and had to pay for 4, washing liquid was scanned 3 times and I bought only one as well. The first time I didn't realize till I got home, then when I went back to Safeway with my groceries and that they stole over 86$ of me the manager wasn't willing to do anything as I already left the market. Now kiwis were scanned as dragenfruit so instead if 3 $ it was almost 10 and 9 extra items that were scanned double! I stayed right at the till and checked my entire recipe then the manager came and said that it can happen. Nothing else, no apology nothing."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this store is the only grocer in the Arcadia area that isn't an AJ's and they know it.  I live a block away so I pretty much HAVE to shop here for convenience.   But for Petes sake!! Put some $$ into this place.  Aside from the cashiers, who are mostly very nice, the rest of the place is so sub-par.  
Negatives:
-Sandwich Deli - Horrible Customer Service - Very weak selection 
-Butcher - Horrendous Selection - Nobody is ever at the counter.  (when you do get them to come out from behind, they are nice people) 
-Overall aesthetics of the store are municipal considering its location. 
-Why would you take out your ATM?  Twice I've gone in to get cash back and the cashiers don't have enough $$ in their registers.  Bring the damn ATM back!!!

Positive: 
Great Beer / Wine selection 

Bottom line is they have the Arcadia patrons by the balls and they know it."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed with this Safeway and it sucks because it's the closest one to my house. The staff made extremely inappropriate jokes to customers, myself included so I was less than pleased. Many of the staff have no idea where things are located, which is again unfortunate. Lastly, the chicken I friend in a pan had a weird film on it after I cooked it. I thought this was weird because it's the same way I have cooked chicken from different stores. I'm really not sure about this Safeway. I think I'll try and avoid it as much as possible."}
{"text":"Bakery consistently puts out raw and undercooked food & the store had no self-checkout... no thank you."}
{"text":"I've had nothing but positive experiences here. Love the product selection. The staff has always been nice to me. It's the nicest of the affordable grocery stores in the area. The florist often gives my toddler a free balloon. The Starbucks inside is a bonus. Only thing missing for me is a Wells Fargo branch! I do seem to run into one of my students from school every time I go, but it's good for kids to see their teachers outside their natural habitat!"}
{"text":"I love this Safeway, the air conditioning always feel great and the starbucks is right in the front and the deli has the best items...i always get Pesto pasta, brocc salad, a chicken...its just easy and breezy to get your stuff and get out. They dont have self cheker though? I have been going there for weeks and just now realized when i was in a freekin hurry and the place was packed....i sure hope they get that soon"}
{"text":"Although the cheese selection is limited at this location, I did find some asparagus.

We had been walking the canal for some exercise and noticed the Safeway nearby, so we ran in to pick up a few items. 

I found a mince pie for the hubby. It was, however, not the best. The Jessie Lord brand was bland. Maybe I should just learn how to make one. Nah. The search continues. 

I would have picked up another Dutch apple pie, too, but they were out of the Dutch variety."}
{"text":"Nice clean grocery store that's well stocked and has  terrific operating hours. After my wife had foot surgery the store had an electric cart to use to do the shopping.  Nice people."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting my family and my mother sent me to go buy some drinks for a family get together. I'm 22 with a valid ID yet the cashier seemed to think it was fake and refused to scan it or go through any other measures to check it's validity. She just refused to sell it to me. I was horrified because this has never happened to me. I understand I'm a young person buying alcohol with an out of state ID, however, I've never been so inconvenienced in phoenix before. I was appalled. Luckily the cvs next door wasn't as daft and rude as the woman at safeway."}
{"text":"Its Safeway! we all know it! 

 If you are like my brother or like Dan D you will come here for the crazy air miles deals and buy 80 bottles of powerade to score 500 miles!!! WOOOOEEE!!.  If you are like me you come here to get snacks or maybe one of their custom \"better than subway\" sandwiches which are actually quite good but the deli people take like 15 minutes to make the thing!

I have frequented this location for years and its small and kind of run down. They did do a little bit on a renovation a couple of years ago which improved the look but because of the size some items are not be available here. It's a decent little place thats good to come get basic items like apples and bananas( When I was on my health kick)

 Side note: Go to the deli and get free samples ! Just don't piss off the deli workers, or they might add their own touch to the delicatessen! :s I have heard stories! No joke!!! Be respectful! 

I remember their slogan \"the ingredients for life\" Well, not all the ingredients but certainly a few here and there..."}
{"text":"I go back and forth as to whether this store deserves 1 or 2 stars, but ill go with 2 because their checkout staff and baggers are always friendly and helpful. Other than that this Safeway has very few redeeming qualities. 

-The deli staff is rude, rude, rude and shockingly slow. I always try to greet them with a smile and be as nice as possible, but it doesn't seem to matter; they always seem annoyed to help you. 
-There are expired products throughout the entire store. I have come across everything...cheese, hummus, meats, yogurt, milk, produce, chips, and various other foods that have been past their expiration date. Some of these items were not just a day or two past either, some were past by a month or more. 
-Once upon a time this Safeway used to be nice and clean, but unfortunately they have let this go as well. I always feel like I have to wash my hands when I leave, nothing seems to be very clean. 
-Where is the butcher?! Isn't a grocery store supposed to have a good butcher to help you choose quality cuts of meat and inform you about how to cook them? Well this store does not. If you need a butcher go to AJs. 

The customer service staff as well as the checkout crew are great, but this store needs a serious makeover and improvements in every department. I hope they make some changes, because I would love to love this location. My advice would be to go to AJs or the Safeway on 32nd street and Camelback."}
{"text":"Update on how terrible this delivery service is:  Safeway gave me a $75 credit to make up for the fact that I got my last grocery delivery 42 hours late.  I used it to place another grocery delivery and, amazingly, I've been waiting an additional 45 minutes for it outside of my 2-hour delivery window and it still hasn't arrived and customer service can't find my driver.  Nice work, Safeway."}
{"text":"The smallest and seemingly most expensive Safeway in the city, tucked in the posh neighborhood of Lake Bonavista. Used to come here for years because of its proximity, plus you need to be there if you work the deli counter, slicing meats and tossing salads!"}
{"text":"I like safeway because they are always nice clean and helpful. THe only reason it isnt 5 stars is you pay more for this treatment, but I say it is worth it. Also they tend to have the better produce."}
{"text":"This rating is for the \"cafe\" only...when you walk in you'll see, to your left, a seemingly nice looking deli counter where one can create their own sandwich/sub/etc. When you see it, KEEP WALKING. The man working was so cold. He maybe said two words throughout the whole ordering process. His way of communicating was staring at me until I told him what I wanted. Talk about uncomfortable. I might have considered coming back since it might have just been an off-day service wise, but the sandwich he \"made\" for me (threw together) was disgusting (and expensive for what it was.) The ingredients tasted expired, I could only manage to eat a couple bites. Won't be back to this part of the store. They do have a cold case near that cafe with pre-made lunch/dinner items that are a much better choice."}
{"text":"Thirty years ago when I lived down the road, they had the best bakery in town.  When they became connected with Von's, the ingredients changed, and now they are no longer the best."}
{"text":"I would just like to say that Eva and Keaton are some of the nicest cashiers we ever have had. Even if they have a line, I prefer to wait in it versus go to another cash register because they give good service."}
{"text":"Safeway should embrace the upscale area by offering clean public restroom facilities. The floors in the bathrooms are disgusting. The smell is rancid and unhealthy. Because a building is old, doesn't excuse public exposure to filth. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Yes, This Safeway is as good as it gets. I always find what I'm looking for, in fact, I'm weaning myself away from the big box store with a round red circle logo because of it. Safeway carries what I'm after, and always a great organic section, too!

The location at Indian School and 48th Street may not have the self check-out line that I enjoy at the Camelback store, but the cashiers are attentive, and more than make up for it, for management keeps an eye on the lines and I'm never waiting more than a few minutes.

Just a bias note: The customers are attractive here, which is the main reason I keep coming back. I guess it's the location right in the heart of the Arcadia District that doesn't hurt, either.

I've noticed, too, which may irritate some shoppers, that they don't always carry certain items, and they run out. This only signals to me that the times that my item IS actually here, is that it's fresh...this is very important to me!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch.  Their subs and sandwiches are awesome.  Fresh baked bread, fresh veggies, a good variety of sauces & spreads and quality meats and cold cuts.  Not only that, the price is very reasonable: $5.25 for a very decent size submarine.  Also, I take advantage of other lunch items like their daily made coleslaw, pasta salads and specialty items like their cold pad thai noodles.  Their daily soups are also very good.  At this particular location they have 4-5 different varietals hot and ready to eat everyday of the week.  Going out for lunch can be costly, so if you want a good amount of food that has quality ingredients, that's also made fresh pretty well everyday for under $10, Safeway is a good bet."}
{"text":"If memory serves, this is the first Safeway I visited when I arrived in Phoenix. I'd heard of Safeway but we didn't have them back east. 

To me, Safeway is the higher-end of grocery stores in the area. The place is clean and the employees are incredibly friendly for grocery store employees. On nearly every visit, someone always asked if they could help me find something. Whenever I did need help, they knew exactly where to go. 

The produce is always neatly arranged, and there is an organic section. The meat and seafood are good quality and the folks back there are quick to help. Even in the wine section, I've been approached by some very knowledgeable staff there to help me choose something based on my tastes and whatever I was cooking that day. The employees in the store seem to be the difference -- they act as if you're shopping at Neiman Marcus and treat you like that caliber of customer. 

I don't physically frequent Safeways very much anymore, as I take advantage of their delivery service. Place and pay for your order online and they bring it to your door!"}
