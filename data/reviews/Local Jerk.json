{"text":"There's better Jerk out there.

The Jerk chicken is perfectly passable as a decent BBQ chicken, but I wouldn't call it authentic. The rice and beans are also on the blander side of things.

It's a nice addition to the neighbourhood, but it definitely leaves something to be desired as far as Caribbean fare goes."}
{"text":"Friendly service, excellent conversation with the woman cooking the food and the beaded fella behind the counter. Trini DOUBLES are king here, despite the namesake (had some jerk chicken too but wasn't the jamaican thick spicy char-grilled jerk I'm used to). Fluffy golden pillows sandwiching savory chana and thick tamarind sauce."}
{"text":"For a place with an awesome name, I had really high hopes for the jerk chicken plate I ordered. It was missing the jerk sauce that I love so much. The homemade hot sauce was tasty, but it wasn't enough to kick up the heat. The rice and peas were flavourless until I dumped in the hot sauce. The double was their saving grace, but not enough for me to return. I've had better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Decent Jerk. Friendly Service. Good for Take-Out.

The jerk chicken plates are a good value; they come with rice and peas, coleslaw, and slice of toast. The jerk isn't the greatest, and it's not that hot, but it hits the spot.

The fish cakes are also a good value(4 for $4), but are a bit bland, so make sure to get tamarind sauce.

I hear the rotis are pretty good, but have yet to try them.

All around, worth checking out for yourself."}
{"text":"Jerks unite this spot has really good rotisserie style jerk chicken but it's the jerk pork belly that really blew my mind. They have rotis, doubles, and veg options as well. Great addition to the hood and they'll be open late. Not many spots to eat there but excellent for take out as well."}
{"text":"All the portuguese places in the hood have some serious competition. Incredibly tasty chicken!!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS Caribbean food (hard to find in Montreal) and just a great atmosphere, chill vibe, and friendly service. Definitely going to make this a regular spot of mine."}
{"text":"Holy sh** this is good.  We've had roti in several places and this is the best one.  I highly recommend trying it.  The chicken is cooked perfectly, it's seasoned so well and my boyfriend swears the hot sauce made the dish.  We are so happy this is in our neighbourhood"}
{"text":"Local Jerk is just plain simple. And I love it for it. 
The size of the leg was surprisingly big, straight out of that oven and super moist. I'm no 'jerk' connaisseur so I can't speak for the authenticity of the sauce - but it's good!

The chicken roti is good. It's what I remember eating from my uncle's cooking. It's simple cooking that gets me good. I'll admit that the shredded chicken could use a bit of something to bring it to that next level.

Don't hesitate to use that hot sauce they serve with it (it'll kill your tastebuds but it makes the dish that much better)."}
{"text":"Tried this place out because Caraibe Delite isn't answering the phone. We didn't like the food one bit. My chicken Roti was flavorless and dry and stringy. My wife had pumpkin Roti, also found it had no flavor. Nice people all the same."}
{"text":"I am downgrading this review because, while the food is still good, I returned the other day for a roti and observed the front-of-house employee continually handling cash and then making rotis without washing his hands. I consider this pretty unacceptable in this day and age, regardless of how busy the restaurant is. He was also keeping his half-eaten lunch on the counter in plain view. I'll add that the restaurant was understaffed and the employee was doing the best that he could with limited resources while getting slammed. However, there needs to be more focus on hygiene, as this type of situation can make people sick."}
{"text":"I'm half Jamaican and I go back to Jamaica every year, so I know good, authentic Caribbean food. This was not that. 

We ordered two rotis this evening. I had chicken and my partner had goat. The roti skin was ridiculous. It was virtually translucent. The chicken was un-spicy and unadorned (I expect more than just bland chicken in my skin). Both rotis were too oily. I've had roti from most of the other Caribbean restaurants in the city, and they were better. I suppose I could give the Jerk a try and revisit my review then, but based on the roti, I am quite disappointed. 

Something else to consider: the hot sauce containers should be covered for delivery. I'm a fan of spicy food, but someone who isn't might have been upset to receive they delivery covered in spilled hot sauce."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, friendly service. Was recommended by a friend to get the goat roti. Never been a fan of goat meat so I was skeptical. Do yourself a favour and just order this. The meat was so tender and flavourful! Yum!!! I've had their jerk chicken as well but the roti really knocked it out of the park. Get the extra spicy sauce. Only downside, cash only."}
{"text":"oh, but to be transported from the cityscape into utter paradise! what longing my heart heaves to return to that small eatery, with its nostalgic counters and chairs, cucumber-lemon-mint water splish-splashing in its plastic water dispenser home; and, the bathroom, what wonder which defies description-- and single stall!!

if i were but a humble chicken, my life's honour would be to be served on one of this establishment's plates, alongside their delectable hot sauce. my friends: \"Cluck Cluck\" indeed!"}
{"text":"Just had their jackfruit roti and corn soup. Definitely hit the spot on a cold rainy day.

Glad they extended their hours to 10pm on weekdays.

Some cheap, good eats in a laid back environment. Worth checking out if it the Plateau. Very vegetarian and vegan friendly but of course they got Jerk chicken as well."}
{"text":"These guys deserve mega props for serving up amazing food full of love and goodness! It's been a while since I've had such wholesome eats out on the town. You know that feeling when you get filled up not only on some kinda savoury wonder but also on the overflowing good energy of the people who prepared it? That's this place and this food. I could go on about how genuinely cool and legit these guys are, but I'll get to the deets on the cuisine. 

The menu options are straight up: you can have a choice of about five different rotis (including vegan options), and/or jerk (also including vegan options), as well as some awesome sides, like a thick and hearty corn soup. The whole thing is real-deal Trinidadian fare, and serious kudos to the owner and the chef!! They were swapping recipes through the kitchen door when we were there. 

Because we were so appreciative (as in, moaning in bliss while eating every bite), they gave us some other treats to try, too, like a combo of sweet potato and pumpkin with tamarind sauce, and some of the jack fruit that makes a convincing meat substitute. 

There is no way to go wrong here - it's ALL good. Go, now! Culture yourself. Feel the love in your belly. Plus, the plants on the shelf have names."}
{"text":"Good doubles! The rest of the food is a bit plain, for local tastes. But you can load up on hot sauce"}
{"text":"great selection of vegetarian options but i usually get the chicken roti, it's filling and delicious. their homemade hot sauce is great: fresh, spicy, and tangy."}
{"text":"Flavorful, delicious, and spicy vegan food! Loved the Bowl, which had homemade seitan and jackfruit"}
{"text":"2 stars because meh, I've experienced better. Went to this place with my boyfriend after following them on Instagram for about 2 weeks prior to their opening, first heard about this place on MTL blog. We ordered 2 jerk chicken bowls (cuisse/chicken thigh), 1 order of chicken roti (pita like) and we got 2 Ting drinks. Disappointed because the rice & beans were really bland, almost tasted like just plain white rice. The coleslaw was also really bland as well, there was absolutely no flavour for the rice or the coleslaw. Their hot sauce that they give you with it was really good. I dipped everything in that to give it more flavours. 

The jerk chicken (rotisserie chicken) skin had a lot of flavours, but it tasted like all the flavour was only on the skin. Maybe it needs to be marinated a bit longer. The chicken was also really hard (like stuck on the bone). I've tried other jerk chicken places around montreal and the chicken meat usually comes off the bone easily. The jerk chicken comes with rice/beans, coleslaw and hot sauce dip. The portions are really small compared to other places, it costed us a total of $40 for 2 people. I have had better jerk chicken and there was nothing special about this place that would make me come back. There was a lot of people, we went around lunch time - noon ish, and it just opened so that may be the reason as well. There were 2 little kids, looked around 10 years old who each had a portion of the jerk chicken bowl to themselves and they finished it. I think thats also another reason you can tell the portions are really small and not filling.

The chicken roti, I did not like but my boyfriend liked it. It looked like shredded chicken and it was curry flavoured. It was wrapped in a super thing pita-like (but thinner) wrap. It's wrapped in quite a weird shape, like an octagon or something so you cant really dip it either. It came with their hot sauce dip which was good. I felt like it needed more hot sauce dip and it was quite bland and needed the hot sauce dip with every bite.

My overall review of this was is a 2/5 because although the jerk rotisserie chicken was good, I felt like the inside of the chicken needed way more flavour throughout. Most of the flavour was only on the skin, and the inside of the chicken was bland and needed more flavour. This was also the case for the rice/beans and the coleslaw, and a bit for the roti (just needed some more spice!). I don't think I would be returning because I have had better jerk chicken around montreal and for the price of it as well, it was not worth it. It was $40 for 2 people and we left feeling unsatisfied (full, but unsatisfied due to taste)."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and while the meat is consistently tender it's lacking in both seasoning and heat. Even though every order comes with a little cup of hot sauce, that punch of spice that you expect from jerk-style cooking isn't really there. My personal favourite is the goat roti but I wish they would crank up the heat!"}
{"text":"I tried this place today for lunch, it has a charm about it from the little counter and stools you eat on to the friendly service with a smile at the front. I took the chicken roti, the chicken was tender and nicely seasoned i just wish it had more heat. They give you a spicy condiment on the side that elevates the roti.

I'm already planning the next time I go, I have to try there jerk chicken! And also try there smoothies they lol promising! Flavours like mango, coconut and other exotic flavours. I wish they sold some Local jerk caps or T's , who doesn't wanna walk around with \"local jerk\" written on the front. Try this place out for great Caribbean flavour"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place a few weeks ago and was meaning to try their food.  Cool little spot playing some old school hip hop.  Asked for a recommendation on what to try and the suggestion was the goat roti.  It did not disappoint!  I am not a big hot sauce guy but they served
It with a side of hot sauce so I gave it a go which brought the dish to a new level... and spice!  Great food at a fair price... be sure to check this spot out!"}
{"text":"What a day to sit outside and eat. Stepping just off St. Laurent I found just the spot on a bright sunny day.

I got a a Jerk Seitan Bowl to take-out which had several sizeable chunks of Jerk sauced and pan fried Seitan. It also had nice crispy edges and good texture.
 
I even found some thyme stems in the Jerk sauce showing real authentic ingredients. It comes over beans and rice - combining for a nice portion especially for $5 plus tax (cash only). 

Note: You can also get Jerked chicken, pork, squash, pulled Jackfruit or goat meat as your bowl topping.

The cool part was I took it to go and sat on their large white wooden bench to eat and take in the local feel of the neighborhood. In doing that I pretty much had my own makeshift terrace (ie. terrasse) for the duration of my lateish lunch.

In case you were wondering about the heat factor - it can sneak up on you so have some orange juice with pulp at the ready like I did, or else try a drink from their unique selection of bottled and boxed choices. 

Now that's really no \"jerk\"."}
{"text":"Local Jerk était ma première expérience de poulet à la Jerk. L'endroit est sympathique, cependant petit, nous avions donc planifié de prendre le repas pour apporter. L'endroit est aménagé pour du take out ou un lunch sur le pouce. Ceci dit, je suis satisfaite de mon repas, le poulet était délicieux, mais peu épicé. Mon copain qui est fan de ce type de cuisine à pour opinion que c'est bon, mais que ca manque allègrement de ''spicy''. En ce qui attrait aux accompagnements le riz est bon et goûteux, mais j'ai moins aimé la petite salade choux, il manquait de vinaigre et elle avait un gout trop sweet pour moi, cela reste une opinion très personnelle. Over all, c'était un très bon souper et pour ma part j'en ai eu pour 2 soupers.
C'est à proximité de chez moi et j'y retournerai certainement."}
{"text":"Ce n'est pas dans mes habitudes de fréquenter un restaurant qui n'est pas au moins végétarien. Mais force est de constater que les plats véganes proposés par Local Jerk, qui composent environ 40% du menu, sont assez uniques à Montréal! Laissez-vous tenter par l'incontournable seitan à la jerk (incluant riz, fèves, pain blanc, petite salade de choux et sauce à base de piments). Vous ne devriez plus avoir faim après mais, si c'est encore le cas, 3 rôtis sont également végétaliens: jackfruit, citrouille et chana. Ils sont bons mais peuvent se révéler assez écurants au bout de quelques bouchées.
Au passage, même s'il est possible de manger dans le restaurant (il y a quelques places assises), c'est préférable de prendre à emporter. D'ailleurs, même si vous mentionnez vouloir manger sur place, la nourriture est quand même servie dans du plastique. Dommage pour les déchets!
Bref, la meilleure expérience est de commander le seitan à la jerk pour emporter. Dans tous les cas, bravo pour les options véganes!"}
{"text":"L'ancien local de Sushi Momo a laissé la place au nouveau Local Jerk, cuisine jamaïcaine sur Duluth, il y a quelques semaines en juin. C'était ma première fois pour le poulet ''jerk'' à la jamaïcaine et honnêtement un gros bof ! Je m'attendais à un poulet très épicé, juteux à l'intérieur et croustillant à l'extérieur, c'est tout le contraire que j'ai mangé ici, assez fade, merci ! Le riz était sec aussi. Il y avait un mini contenant de sauce épicée, il n'y avait même pas de sauce épicée d'extra sur le comptoir pour rajouter dans son plat, moi qui aime les sauces épicées. J'avais pris ¼ de poulet cuisse / riz + boisson ting, total de 14,65$. Les prix sont raisonnables. Y'avait deux autres clients qui mangés sur place. Y'avait un bon beat de musique jamaïcaine, ça c'était sympa ainsi que la boisson ting que j'ai bu. Mon collègue de travail jamaïcain est venu avec sa femme ici et lui non plus, il n'a pas aimé leur poulet. Il m'a fait remarquer qu'il n'avait pas vu de jamaïcains dans la cuisine et moi non plus d'ailleurs.....Je reviendrais peut-être manger autre chose (chèvre/porc/...) que du poulet un autre jour ici, mais pour l'instant si je veux manger du bon poulet dans le coin, j'irais chez les Portugais qui font du meilleur poulet, croustillant à l'extérieur et juteux à l'intérieur. Bonne chance pareil à ce commerce ! Tous les goûts sont dans la nature.

2/5 visité en juillet 2016"}
{"text":"I ordered the jerk chicken and a chicken roti.

Jerk chicken; the skin was tasty,but the inside of the chicken was missing some taste. It needed to be marinated for longer or some extra jerk sauce on top of it,would have been better.
Rice that came with it tasted bland.

Roti was pretty big, but the inside is just chicken potato and curry,it was missing some kick to it."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, we went for the jerk chicken but they ran out so i had the pork jerk, it was very tender but lack the jerk sauce it was just a watery soy sauce, my bf's roti taste very blend, had better jerk and roti before, the hot sauce and coslaw was too sweet. Not authentic but nice atmosphere, i will be back and give a chance for the jerk chicken."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a very small shop on Duluth, might be a little bit hard to spot if you're strolling down Saint-Laurent. The inside is quite small (1 table and a few counter spots) but its a nice spot to go to for a quick bite.

FOOD: The food was quite good. You can definitely taste the authentic spices that they use in their Jerk Chicken. Although the menu is pretty small and limited, you know that they prepare their food with care.

PRICE: Pretty affordable spot. For the quality that you're getting and the taste-factor, it's pretty worth it. The cost ranges from about 5 to 10$ before tax. 

SERVICE: Staff is very friendly and are happy to serve you."}
{"text":"Nice service, fast , tasty chicken, vegan choice wow ! , juste few places to seat, take out and eat at the park, open late nigth until 11pm i think."}
{"text":"Jerk chicken with vegetarian options? Are you kidding me? 

No they're not kidding. 

It's pretty good. A little over spiced but not overpriced, and chewy."}
