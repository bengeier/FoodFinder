{"text":"Very pleasant and honest owner/chef.   Had a great deal on halibut and chips in the summer but had to raise price a bit but the quality and quantity more than make up for the modest increase.   I had some fish and chips today,  halibut and fries.  Fish was very delicate and perfectly cooked.   Fries are quite good with some skin on the potatoes and some light seasoning .    They have a great deal on chicken souvlaki dinner.  I'll try that later this week.   Very clean place and I think they do karaoke at night.   Family owned so they are pretty motivated to do a great job,  which they do.   The last time I had this quality of fish and chips was down at Rodneys but that was basically twice the price.    Great local place with parking a plenty."}
{"text":"I really have to give 5 Stars to this place. Why ???  5 Reasons. 1 - Great Fish and Chips (best my family has had) 2 - Ice cold beer on a hot summer day. And it's only $4 a beer during the afternoon. 3 - Service !! Excellent.  It was busy in there yet I somehow am on first name basis with all                                         kitchen and wait staff. They make time for their customers. 4 - The place is clean.   Bar, tables, bathroom, floor etc... 5 - The place is fun."}
{"text":"Just passing thru and needed dinner and a hockey game so yelp brought up this place close. Doesn't look like much , your usual bar in a plaza. It's a neighbourhood place with locals. But it's good food and great price with a hard working staff.  I had spaghetti with meat sauce and garlic bread special  for only 7$! It's nothin fancy but No complaints."}
