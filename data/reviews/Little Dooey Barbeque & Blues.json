{"text":"I was hoping this place was going to be good...I should have done a better job managing my expectations.  When you can rattle off 5 superior BBQ places in NYC (not even the mainstay good ones) you know you're in trouble.    The meal started well with excellent hush puppies.  The rest of the food was mediocre at best.  The mac and cheese fried things were pretty nasty and the okra wasn't very good either.  I got the ribs and wasn't impressed. Little tiny, flavorless ribs on a comically large plate...maybe the pulled pork would have been a better bet?   Not sure what the deal is with this place - seems like it would only take a little more effort to improve the food that extra bit to make this place good...Hopefully they will re-engineer it before they go out of business - I would love to have a good BBQ place that close."}
{"text":"The outside of The Little Dooey looks so cool and inviting.  It reminds me of a restaurant you would have found in New York City \"back in the day,\" with its brick exterior and old-fashioned sign.  Unfortunately, the illusion ends when you walk in the door.  It feels like the interior was thrown together from the most basic dining accommodations possible.  It's really a shame because with that look outside, this restaurant could accomplish way more with regard to theming.   Anywho, we stopped by to try The Little Dooey one night after shopping all day at Concord Mills Mall.   We were seated in one of the boring rooms and the menu wasn't that impressive either.  We decided to stay; we were too tired to find someplace else.  The BBQ was average, the service was below average, and the atmosphere was more of a drinking and non-eating crowd.  And did I mention the lack of cool decor?    Unfortunately, it's not someplace I'd return unless they amped up the coolness factor a bit."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with my plate at Little Dooey's.  I get the pulled pork (splash a little smoked sauce and then vinegar) with jalepeno hush puppies, beans, and fried okra.  The okra may leave something to be desired but everything else is usually top notch.  They bring in live music on the weekends but I've never gone in that late in the evening."}
{"text":"Drink prices were pretty good.  As far as the food, it was ok.  One of the folks in our group got the brisket, but was not impressed (he's from Texas, so he considers himself a brisket expert).  The appetizer platter included fried green tomatoes, which were delicious!  The fried pickles were a little salty.  Our waiter suggested that we add some of the barbeque sauce to the ranch to tone down the salt, but I just didn't want think that barbeque and sauce and ranch dressing was going to be very good mixed together. The service was my only complaint.  It was slow both times we've been there, but the quality of the food almost makes up for the service."}
{"text":"This place had pretty good BBQ and a nice atmosphere. It was a Sunday afternoon when I went so it wasn't crowded at all. Like to see what it's like on the weekend."}
