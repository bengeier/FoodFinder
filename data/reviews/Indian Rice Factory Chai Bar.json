{"text":"The recently reno'ed and unveiled chair bar is a great spot! The garden patio is certainly one of the most tranquil, pleasant spots in the area. They've recently opened the side entrance around the corner on Howland, so no more trekking through the restaurant, which is nice.

The chai itself is real and delicious - just enough of a bite to it. Yum!"}
{"text":"So tranquil - great for studying esp if you're lucky enough to get a window seat! 

Decent 'mericano ($2.50) and macadamia cookie ($1). The spicy traditional chai ($4) will definitely wake you up. They also serve food which is great when you get hungry :D There's also wifi so just ask for the password.

Washrooms are tiny but very well-kept. Just walk straight back into the mirror - they're tucked behind there!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with 3 friends on a Friday at 1:30 p.m.

In a nutshell, won't go back.

The patio is lovely, but on our visit most of the good things ended there.

Service took nearly 30 minutes... this from a menu with exactly 3 lunch items on it: veg plate, non-veg plate and pakoras. On top of that my lunch was nearly forgotten. I guess it's normal for one person to sit there waiting and waiting. I was especially ticked off when another table got their two plates while we had one waiting. And this on top of our pakoras coming out after as well. By the time I corrected this problem with the cook who brought my meal out, the papad was clearly scorched in their rush to finish meal. Lastly, nobody seemed to be able to stay on top of getting 4 sets of cutlery and napkins out to our table.  All this and only 3 of 10 tables were taken, so not busy.

The food is not exceptional, although the pakoras are worth it. The plates themselves for $10 + tax are two curries, rice, a papad, and some cold sliced tomato and cucumber. The tamarind dipping sauce for the pakoras was not the usual jarred sweet kind, so that was a bit nice.

All in all the owners/management need to make a choice. They either add some staff who can pay attention to what is going on at the tables in the garden behind the coffee bar so that service is not a joke, or they figure out how to speed up service on what is otherwise a very simple lunch, and not convey that you are getting something more special than it is.

I was resistant to leaving a tip back at the counter, but my friends went all Canadian on me. Frankly the gap in service between the front of house and the kitchen is so glaring that a further payment for service is really unjustified. Needs much improvement."}
{"text":"Was driving by hungry and remembered the reviews I read about Indian Rice Factory and so I decided to give them a try.  No menu to choose from, just two options, meat or vegetarian.  I choose the meat option - to go.  
Three little styrofoam containers - one of rice, one of a vegetarian sauce, and one of the chicken curry. 
The vegetarian one was a bit gritty, the chicken was fresh, curry was a bit spicier than I'd hope for.  
Do not recommend."}

Add another indie cafe to TO's steamy scene, but a ways away from the downtown strip scene. Owners of the classy Indian Rice Factory have converted an adjacent barn into serene and sparse Chai Bar. With only standing space in the cafe itself, one can survey the delights of this cafe in a verdant back patio with a bubbling koi pond!

We ordered the Masala Chai ($4) and it was quite the production! Indian spices are ground in a mortar and pestle for each order, submerged in black tea and lightened with milk and sugar. Really close to the chai that people in India like. The tea was a nice blend, although fussy, of spices and difficult to ascertain what-was-what based on taste alone. The chai they are trying to emulate should have strong highlights of cardamom and cloves, which this chai lacks because they've thrown everything including the kitchen sink into the tea.The chai is served in a filtered cup so that the sludge doesn't enter the slipstream. Smart move!

The rusk cake ($1) aka Indian biscotti was a nice, crispy accompaniment though the Parle-G cookies (3 for $1) were disappointingly soggy. 

The polish in both space and food is apparent and expected, since Indian Rice Factory has high standards. I am glad that Chai Bar is close to home, because the other items on the menu: affogato and Greg's ice-cream have traditionally been close to my heart and I want to try them out."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Walked by the place a million times and I've finally went in today. Small, cozy, quiet. Good place to do some work unlike a noisy Starbucks. A little pricey considering such a small coffee but well worth it. Will come back, maybe even be a regular."}
