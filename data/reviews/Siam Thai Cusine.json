{"text":"I've only been here once and must say the food is delicious! They were also very accommodating when I asked for no mushrooms in any of my order due to a mild allergy. I will be back for more."}
{"text":"I only stopped based on review as would have never found it otherwise. Great Choice as the food and service was great. The server took her time to explain each dish and the food was very good and we will be back. I am now a big fan of Yellow Curry, thanks!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! When pulling into the parking lot for a second I thought where am I, but as soon as I walked in and the smell surrounded me, my mouth started watering. The atmosphere is traditional to any asian style restaraunt. The staff was friendly and the food was plenty. I would definately eat here again!"}
{"text":"Nice decor, service was as good as it was asked for. Food came out very quickly after we ordered it, which makes me wonder whether they have prepared contents that they assemble by order??? If so, it explains the overcooked noodles in the Padthai. I didn't like the fact that they don't offer Padthai with flat noodles, but only with thin noodles... Took away from the whole Padthai eating experience that comes with the flat noodles and the flavors it generates. It was also extremely sweet marinated and had no particularly Thai spice flavors. The meat to noodle portion was pretty good though. Again, did not get Padthai as Padthai should look and taste. So far Royal Jasmine in Litchfield is my favorite Thai in West valley."}
{"text":"this placed have good foods but too exspensive for the portion and service they provide. bad service, menu too exspensive. not recomand for anybody that know how to eat thai foods. overall this place is a one star palce for a four star price.."}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars just because the food is decent. The staff is rude. Last time we ordered out I said I would order out again to see if it was just the day...I'm afraid not. I asked for soy sauce and utensils and got a sigh of disgust. I'm sorry it's not my problem you are too busy and don't hire enough help. You're charging enough to be able to... my recommendation go TO SIAMESE KITCHEN @ 43RD AND OLIVE. Super sweet lady at the front and cook (owner), better prices...you won't be disappointed !!"}
{"text":"We went for an early dinner around 4:30, ordered Tom Yum Shrimp, Papaya Salad and Pineapple Fried Rice to share with 4 people.   The food was just ok, but took quite a long time. The portion was kinda small for the price.  We got a very few sliced mushroom in Tom Yum Shrimp soup, no other veggies. A very small portion of Papaya Salad that was barely enough to share and didn't taste flavorful. However, the pineapple fried rice was not bad.   The service was really bad, the server never come back to check on us, no drinks refill."}
{"text":"Our 2nd time back at Siam Thai. I LOVE THAI and I LOVE SPICY even more. I usually cannot pull myself away from the pad Thai shrimp. But this time, I tried a curry entree and wow was it tasty. We started with the Siamese Plate - chicken satay, egg rolls, fried wonton, Thai toast and fish cakes. All were quite tasty and were served with sweet and sour and peanut sauce. For lunch I ordered Beef Ma-Sa-Man Curry- It was very tender beef (almost like pot roast) simmered in red curry, coconut milk, potato's, peanuts, onion. Ry has the Duck with Pineapple Curry - red curry with bell pepper, onion, basil and Thai herbs. Both were served with white rice. They were very hearty portions and I even had left overs. Our server took the time to explain the different Curry's to us as well. I love this place!!"}
{"text":"This place is legit.   I have been to many of the Thai places around Tempe, Mesa and Phoenix but this is about as good as I've tasted here.  I had the Fried Rice and Pad Thai on my initial visit and was impressed with both the taste AND the portion size.  Despite my slim frame I can pack down the calories and usually don't bring leftovers home in boxes.  I did here and it reminded me of a WONDERFUL place in Denver (Golden Saigon) that I haven't found an equivalent yet.    I will be going again and will try some of the other offerings but I was pleased with my meal and the price was affordable.   Now I've been in AZ for most of my life but I did live in New Orleans for 4 years so \"ghetto\" is an overused and should be relative term for people here.  Is the outward appearance impressive?  No.  But was I concerned for my safety in it's unassuming strip mall?  Hardly.  Inside the seating is comfortable and the ambiance appropriate.  Is this Snooze?  Heavens no  and people that are looking for that type of atmosphere seem to like to take pictures of their food more than really expand their palette IMHO.  If you've been to any legit Asian food restaurant in other cities they are much worse than this place and comparatively they have a good amount of space for the outward appearance.    I would highly recommend folks check this place out"}
{"text":"Ordered coconut soup, chicken satay, pad-see-ew beef, red curry, sticky rice and a few other items. Service was prompt and friendly, but as Thai food goes, this would be considered very average anywhere else (i.e California or Hawaii for example). If you;'re in AZ this is a good find, but if you are traveling and used to good Thai food, skip it."}
{"text":"A Thai meal to compare all others too! The BEST Thai in the Valley of the Sun! Tom Yum and Pad Thai are our top favorites. This place is a must!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and good service.  Had the red curry at Thai hot and was not disappointed.  Will definitely have to try more."}
{"text":"Phenomenal and without question, the best Thai in the Valley. I came here on a Friday night with a friend around 630 and we were seated right away. We shared the appetizer platter (special recognition for the Thai Toast), papaya salad, pad see ew, and green curry with chicken. Don't forget the thai iced tea and mango with sticky rice for dessert! It was a feast and every dish was equally delicious. Our service was very good and for the amount of food we had, I would say the pricing is reasonable.   I love in CenPho but would haul my cookies all the way up here for Thai this good! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Authentic and fantastic!  Don't be fooled by the outside- the fido is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Mine and my husband's favorite place for dates! We went here last night for our 3rd anniversary and the food was delicious as usual. It's our second time coming and I can honestly say it's our favorite place to eat by far. Nothing else compares. I love the Fried Fish Cakes, the Pad Thai Shrimp, and the Stir Fried Ginger Combination plate. If you're looking for a nice, clean, quiet place to eat this is the place."}
{"text":"Incredibly tasty Thai food. I order the radnau noodles, Thai fried rice, yellow curry and pad Thai. All are amazing. Great for vegetarians because you can add as many veggies as you want in and customize everything to fit your wants. Big portions to share. Their Thai tea is great too."}
{"text":"Visited with another couple last night. Good but unremarkable appetizers, OK but not memorable service - that's the down side. Outstanding entrees - for the record, pineapple/chicken curry, pad thai, cashew chicken (#7), basil chicken (#8) - all were delicious. Portion size more than adequate. Our experience caused me yet again to reflect on the term 'crapulent' - that is, the state of feeling uncomfortably bloated as a consequence of overindulgence in the pleasures of the table. It's one of those places where it's difficult to stop eating, even when you know you've had more than enough, 'cause it just tastes so darned good. Some of the best Thai cuisine I've run across in the Phoenix market, I think :-)  ."}
{"text":"Been going there for a couple years now. I love the food, the decore, and the selection of the menu.  Their Siam Duck, Teriyaki Beef, Green papaya salad, beef salad, and fried banana are all my favorites just to name a few. But I am having problem with the variation of the services I received there. They are mostly decent, but I had a very bad experience with one of the waitress when I visited last time. It was an early evening and we were the only one there when we first walked in. Two other groups came in after us shortly. While we were waiting to get our menu, the other two groups already got their drinks and placed their orders. We asked if we can be helped to place our order, we were neglected and ignored. I am not sure if it's language barrier problem, but it feels like she was yelling at us when we were wondering why we haven't been helped. We end up walking out there empty stomached.  Again, since I have been going there for so long and liked it so much, I don't want to give it a bad review. So I took two stars off the five stars that I would give them just for the food. Hope the services improve soon!"}
{"text":"The only thing that I want to eat here is the green Thai curry since most of the dishes contain soy.  94% of all soy has been genetically modified.  Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) were allowed onto our market with no human safety studies.  In animal studies they have been linked to tumors, allergies, holes in the digestive tract and could potentially cause the bacteria in your intestines to produce pesticides.  Watch the movie Genetic Roulette on YouTube for the complete story.  Soy, corn, canola, Hawaiian papaya, sugar from sugar beets and milk products that aren't organic  are most likely GMO.  Some zucchini and yellow squash are also GMO.  The green Thai curry is very good, and I like the fact that they have brown rice."}
{"text":"Party of 4 on a Sunday at 8pm. We decided to try something new. Restaurant was busy and service was slow.  They took our drink order in a timely fashion but took a while to take the rest of our order. We ordered Pad Thai, 2 chicken fried rice & stuffed chicken wings. I had the pad Thai and was not good at all. Maybe cause I've had better. But I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and decided to write a review because I think it got better! LOL. The green curry is amazing and the coconut soup is also amazing! I've also had the pad thai and see ew, they are pretty good. I think this is my favorite Thai restaurant in the valley. Good place to try."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been here about 4 times in the past 2 months and have yet to be disappointed. Yes, the strip mall is not pretty but the restaurant is clean, well-decorated, and always nice and cool in the summer.   The food is what it's all about though. I'm addicted to the hot and spicy noodles with beef, would marry them if it were legal. I'm also a big fan of the soups, especially lemon grass. My boyfriend, who is picky about wonton soup, love theirs."}
{"text":"I ate at Siam in Telluride and am just seeing these reviews and learning that there is one here in the valley. My favorite spot to eat that trip so now I need to check this place out for myself. Drunken noodle rules!!!"}
{"text":"This place is incredibly delicious. My partner and I eat here at least 2-3 times a month. Our faves: Pad See-Ew, Tom Yum soup with shrimp. The service is always great, the atmosphere is cozy on the inside--though you might never guess that by looking at the outside- it is in a random little strip mall that looks like nothing special. LOVE THIS PLACE. If you know good Thai food, you will love it too."}
{"text":"I heard some hackling in the kitchen so that sort of scared me as I was waiting for my food. I asked for some limes and got the lime juice you'd get from a lime juice bottle. I got a curry dish and a shrimp salad. the shrimp salad was pretty tasty! 4 stars for the food and 2 stars for the service."}
{"text":"I had a pleasant lunch here. It was the first time I've ever had pad thai. It was good. I will be going again very convenient location. Staff was really friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Been here twice.  When we ate in, the food was great.  Two days later, placed a take out order and they got it all wrong.  East in I'd tipu have a choice."}
{"text":"My husband and I live nearby so we decided to give it a try even though we think the best Thai in the valley is in downtown Phoenix at the wild Thaiger where we eat weekly. We ordered a curry dish, a noodle dish and the Tom ka soup. All had a flavor that neither of us cared for..very bitter and rancid tasting. The beef in the curry had lots of fatty gristle on it and the Tom ka was severely lacking in coconut milk. I only had a bite of everything and then opted for a Wendy's hamburger..That's  how unimpressed I was. This place may be close to home, but you can bet I won't be returning. Steer clear of this one!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure! It doesnt look like much from outside but the inside is very cute.I was in Thailand last summer and the food in here tastes just like the ones in Thailand. The most expensive food in the menu is 11.50$ and they have great selection for 7-8$ I know I will be there soon again!"}
{"text":"We tried this place randomly and had a great experience. The shrimp tom yum soup was delish as well as the spicy basil noodles with chicken and the best part was the sticky rice with custard for dessert! Good ambiance and service was good too. Will be eating there again soon!"}
{"text":"Best Thai I've had in the Glendale area. The decor is pleasant and service friendly."}
{"text":"Thai is one of my favorite cuisines - it has a unique and delicate balance of spice with flavor. Siam Thai just nails it with its signature Pad Thai. It's one of the best Pad Thais I've ever had. I'd also recommend  the Iced Thai Tea, as it's is a great accompaniment to the meal. The Panang Curry is also good, though, not the best.  The restaurant isn't exactly in the most \"happening\" places of Glendale, but the decor is tastefully done - distinctive elephant shaped chairs, for example, complete with Thai music.   The service was good and prompt., and can be even better if they have more waiters.   In summary, if you like Thai, you'll love Siam Thai!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is not very fancy but it is cosy. Service is very friendly and fast. We had the spicy basil beef, fish cakes and flat rice noodles with combination seafood gravy. It was DELICIOUS. I do recommend this place and for sure I will be returning."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Thai restaurant in the city and I've probably made my way through at least 80% of the Thai restaurants here. I've also been coming here for years and have eaten my way through quite a bit of the rather large menu. They also have the best som tum (papaya salad) of any Thai restaurants I've been to here.  The largest plus is that, unlike so many other Thai places, when a white gentleman such as myself say \"hot\", they actually make the food deliciously, sweat-inducingly hot. But in that regard, I'm a bit of a heat masochist. Medium is still very spicy for most palates and mild even has a slight kick to it -- as it should, mind you.  Also, the area may look a tad run-down if you're not used to Glendale strip malls, but it's definitely safe."}
{"text":"AMAZING THAI!!! Ignore where it's located and enjoy the food! Dining room is nice, odd set up...you have to walk through dry storage to get to the giant bathroom BUT you could also see the employees cleaning and wiping the silverware piece by piece. So yummy..next we are trying the soup that comes out with a flame!!!"}
{"text":"I went for the second time yesterday, and it did not disappoint!!! I love their willingness to work with you on a dish to make it exactly as you want! Best Thai Food I have ever tried!"}
{"text":"I am SHOCKED by all the 5 star reviews.  This is by far the worst Thai food I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai and Pad See Yew is really great! I usually order them in Thai hot and its delicious. Definitely spicy, but bearable. I love this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I always try to locate the best local spot for authentic Thai food when we first move to a new area, and Siam Thai Cuisine not only met, but exceeded all of our expectations. Excellent food and service. We always tend to split their Pad Thai dish and their Yellow Curry dish, which has never disappointed. Great Thai iced tea and coffee as well. Whether you're thinking of trying Thai food food for the first time, or you're just trying to locate a new local spot, this is the best in my opinion."}
{"text":"When you drive up to this place, no amount of four and five star reviews can dispel the innate dread that is uniquely conjured up when you're visiting one of the seediest-of-the-seedy-looking Phoenix strip malls. You know the ones, bleached out by the sun, faux-gold-trimmed red letters blaring at you. The instinctive feeling that there is no way you're going to make it from your car to the door without being asked to loan a few dollars to a guy down on his luck but somehow inexplicably blessed with a handgun down his waistband.  Then you walk in. And it's like you're in a dainty Asian bistro in Scottsdale. Except there's one big screen TV and it's tuned to CMT. Ha ha, you smugly think to yourself - there's no way a TV would be tuned to CMT in Scottsdale! But then you are just taken with how lovely the place is. But WTF? Do you seat yourself? Two Asian women dressed as servers are fliitting about, but don't seem to see you (as it turns out, this is an unfortunate recurring theme here).   Eventually, one does see you. \"Two?\" she pantomimes, holding up two fingers but not actually speaking. \"Two,\" you say, acknowledging. They then seat you at the only table in the entire restaurant that is made for two. Neatly tucked right behind the kitchen's microwave, which you will hear beeping incessantly during your meal. I am being jocular, of course, but seriously, we looked around and we were both like \"wow, this is the only two-seater in the whole place. They must not get many parties of two!\" While I am trying to be funny, I'm not at all kidding about the microwave beeping.  During the remainder of the meal, the wait staff can only be described as \"oddly distracted and negligent, considering there were maybe ten people in the whole restaurant.\" There was no rudeness, and once our orders were in, food came VERY quickly. The thing is, it took fifteen minutes (and a pretty decent glare on my part) before a waitress came to ask us what we wanted to drink. Well thank you, since I've been sitting here for fifteen freaking minutes, I know not only what I want to drink, but what I want to eat. So we ordered.  When the food came, and it came fast, it was a blizzard of BRILLIANCE. I had the hot and spicy fish (hot), my wife had the pad thai (medium).  Both dishes were unbelievably delicious. I had mine \"hot\" and it was agreeably hot, I will try the \"thai hot\" next time just to see how much they can make me sweat. Both dishes were absolutely wonderful. The appetizer of \"thai eggrolls\" was delicious, if meager.  During the meal we were asked if we wanted refills this many times: 0. We were asked how our meal was this many times: 0. We were approached by our waitress for any reason whatsoever this many times: 0. Once we were done with our meal, we flagged our waitress down (clearly, she was having a rough night, what with the 6 or 8 people left in the restaurant) and managed to get a check.   As bad as the service was, the food is so stupid good that I'm giving four stars anyway. Do yourself a favor: if you like Thai food, give Siam Thai a shot."}
{"text":"Very tasty Thai. Huge portions! Chx Satay is big enough for 4. Pad Thai very good at medium spice and guaranteed to need togo box."}
{"text":"The place was cute (I can't comment on authenticity, because I'm as white as they come) and the strip mall was a typical strip mall, not intimidating whatsoever.   The food was satisfactory. My friend and I had crispy tofu to start, I had the Hot and Spicy noodles with tofu and my friend had the Ginger Tofu. We were both incredibly happy with the way the tofu was cooked - it was ACTUALLY crispy - but just thought the sauces and veggies were \"meh.\"  I would be willing to try here again for one of their curries. I'm not sure when I will make it back to Siam Thai; the distance is a little to far to drive for a mediocre meal."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, any Asian restaurant other than the Indian restaurants are always an adventure for me. And I loved this thrill ride.   My room mate is Thai and he helped me order some of the BEST Thai food, I have ever had. He vouches for this place.   Try the Thai tea and coffee. They are delicious. The fried noodles were divine...   And if you like uber spicy food, like I do, try everything \"Thai hot\". If you don't sweat by the end of the meal, please comment back!!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight & was a waste the squid was rubbery & chicken egg rolls had no chicken the almond chicken was pretty delicious if it dnt have so much huge pieces of green onions wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"We ate at Siam Thai tonight around 5:50.  We were seated within a couple minutes and then we waited.  There were about eight other people total eating at this time.  It took over five minutes for the waitress to come and take our order and we had not received any water or attention.  We ordered the egg rolls and the pad thai with chicken.  The rolls were good but it was $2.50 for two...The pad thai was quite disappointing.  The portion was very small and most of it was a stack of sprouts.  We waited for over ten minutes to even ask for our check.  We left frustrated, hungry and swearing to never return.  Thai Rama remains the best Thai place we have visited in the valley."}
{"text":"Warning!  Please don't go there, fresh maybe.  Service OK.  I don't think they know how to mix flavors good.  It was freakishly weird-tasting."}
{"text":"Siam is a nice little place. Friendly staff. I like the decor. The stripmall that it's in isn't that bad. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here and I've eaten at over at least 100 different Thai restaurants over the years. Amazing restaurant, friendly staff, very fast service and excellent food. Three of us agreed, it was a great experience all around. Will go back again and won't hesitate to recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"How in the world does this place have a good rating on yelp? My failed attempt to find delicious Thai fried rice on the west side has started with TREMENDOUS room for improvement.  I ordered the Thai fried rice with vegetables and added chicken with a spicy request of 4 on their scale of 1 to 5.  This was the oiliest, blandest fried rice I have ever eaten.  It was so oily that I feel like my skin is oozing oil now, and I didn't touch my food with anything besides a fork and knife.  They must have misunderstood how spicy I wanted it because it had absolutely zero spice to it.    Stay away from their fried rice.  Maybe other dishes are better, but I will never know.  I need to go wash my face from feeling greasy now.  Blah.  What a waste of carb-calories, time and money."}
{"text":"Finally a place with good papaya salad AND they serve it with wings AND you can get it Thai or Lao style! What?!! They don't serve it with sticky rice, which is a bit of a bummer, but who cares? It was delicious.  There was only one waitress and a pretty busy night, but she was holding her own and very sweet, so that was good.  My friends ordered Pad Woon Sen and Pad Thai which they thought were really good too. We were happily stuffed campers all around. One of my friends was preggers (aka hard to please), so you know they threw down on her Pad Thai or we would've had some hormonal issues all up in that place. ;)   Definitely on top of my list for Thai food in the Phoenix area! YUM!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Phoenix hands down. My family has been going there for years and have ever had a bad dish."}
{"text":"I have a large family and there is something here for everyone, including some vegan options. I highly recommend the tom yum soup with chicken!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! Delicious every time and very accommodating of a soy allergy."}
{"text":"One of the yummiest thai places I've been to in Phoenix. I absolutely love their pad se ew and thai tea! A must try local restuarant!"}
{"text":"Once again had an amazing meal at Siam.... Beef/broccoli /silver noodles so so good !  Highly recommended !!  Best Thai food in town !"}
{"text":"We have been do this Thai place a couple of times now and love the great food! Do try it out...we have waited a long time to have a great Thai food place in the west valley."}
{"text":"Food is delicious been there twice better with 4 people or more you can order more plates and try more yummy food. We really enjoyed the vegetable and tofu soup, duck with vegetables, the chicken pineapple curry, sweet and sour fish. The sampler appetizers is really good. Service is friendly, clean and really nice."}
{"text":"I thought the food was good. I am from Seattle and the Thai there is amazing so I guess my expectations are high but I would go back. I would recommend ordering pad thai one star hotter than you think you can handle as it is not as spicy as one might think. I ordered green curry with tofu at 3 stars and it was as hot as my hubby's pad thai at 4 stars. Overall the outside is sketchy and yes you are in the hood, but it is worth checking out if you can handle the sketchy mystique."}
{"text":"Siam has to be one of my favourite Thai restaurants outside of Thailand, worldwide. Having spent three months in Thailand I became a big fan of going from place to place sampling the various different takes on certain dishes. Siam provides the taste that takes me back to the great times I spent out there in providing authentic food with deep flavours with all the right ingredients.  The staff are incredibly friendly and always happy to help.  The food comes in large, family sized portions. This is especially effective with the soups (I thoroughly recommend the Tom Yum) that are presented in a Thai Fire Pot. Great for get togethers, just take the ladle and dish it out.  The only draw back to this is that if you are ordering for one or two people, it doesn't give you great scope to try a variety of foods (unless you want to go home with LOTS of left overs... actually no, that's a great idea!).  All in all, every return to Phoenix just isn't complete without a trip to Siam. Go try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Absolutely live this place!  Their portions are generous. I love their wonton soup and the poo poo platter. No matter what we order we have never been disappointed.  My husband tends to order a different entree every time we go to try out new things and I stick to the sweet and sour chicken to share with our 6 year old and taste whatever he ordered. The thing I love about the sweet and our chicken is that it's lightly breaded and not greasy, their sweet and sour sauce is delish and the veggies are nice and crisp. Can't say enough about this place. No need to look for another Thai place in the valley this is it!"}
{"text":"Do not order the soup, its dried up grass and no meat. Everything tastes like bland. Would not recommend. Also, automatic gratuity of 18% for group of 5, that's 3 kids and parent. I would not mind if the service were good but it was bad."}
{"text":"This place has 4.5/5 stars for a reason! It can be hard to find a good Thai place when you're new to the area. Well, I've found one, and I'll be back again and again! I may live 25 minutes away, but it's worth the drive!  I ordered the broccoli with beef entree (number four on their menu) at the \"Thai hot\" spiciness. I had them fry it in their garlic sauce, as I'm not too keen on shellfish sauces.  The meal is excellent! The rice is cooked just so, and the beef is tender and moist. Nothing is over or undercooked, and tastes great!  Thanks for the great meal!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Siam since 2009. My family used to eat at Siam a few times a month until we moved to the far northwest valley and haven't dined at Siam in over a year. My family visited the restaurant recently & noticed the taste of the food has changed. The Pad Thai was much sweeter, there was less ingredients (meat, shrimp, vegetables) and the noodles were broken & soggy. The Beef Massaman Curry's portion was smaller and the fried banana wasn't coated in coconut shreds like before. Maybe the owners sold Siam Restaurant to someone else and they changed the recipes or maybe it was an off day?"}
{"text":"Found this gem when in Glendale, it was worth the drive from Phoenix.  Ran into my pal, Layle there, that was a surprise!  I had take out which is not my fave when trying out a new place but well packaged for the ride home and still steaming hot, both huge in my world.   The red curry was so delicious, I had it with chicken and I also ordered fried rice with shrimp, that was excellent!  Portion was huge too, more than enough for three meals and the leftovers reheated beautifully.  When I got there, they were quite busy  so I figured I would be waiting awhile but that was not the case.  They took my order and I was out of there in maybe 15 minutes!  Not pretty from the outside, older strip mall location but just like it looks in the pictures on the inside."}
{"text":"FYI there is no lunch menu so be prepared to order an entree during the day.  Figure $12 w/ tip for lunch, but you'll enjoy the leftovers later!  Yelp'd around and saw iain's positive review, so here I came.  Thai egg rolls are just like the Chinese veg ones except this also had ground chicken, served w/ sweet and sour sauce... nothing special.  But the pad thai was great (less sweet and saucy compared to Swaddee's for ref) and also the fresh bean sprouts were on the side to be mixed in (kudos, we all should say NO to limp overcooked shoots!)  I'll be hauling people here for dinner when in the West Valley, or even if it's myself at lunch."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The place is so much nicer on the inside than it seems when you see it from the street. Every time I go there I leave happy. Their Thai ice cream is amazing. One caution, the food can be very Spicey so if you are not sure what level of spice to choose go at least one level lower."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had!!  I LOVE Thai food, and I consider myself lucky to live so close to Siam Thai Cuisine.  Sure, the east valley is littered with great Thai food places, but the best one I've tried is right here in Glendale.  I'm a total white guy, so I can't tell you if it's the most authentic Thai experience out there, but can tell you it's delicious!  I've tried a lot of things on their menu, and have yet to be disappointed.  Their soups are fantastic.  For appetizers, the Satay chicken comes with a refreshing zesty pepper garnish, and the jerky kabobs (can't remember the name) are incredible.  The curries are excellent and varied as well, from the stew-like Masaman curry to the spicy Red curry.  You may be tempted to try the Pad Thai, as it's generally a good \"benchmark\" for Thai restaurants in general and is a common first-timer entree if you've never had Thai food...  It's different than other places (don't know which is more or less \"authentic\") and while it's still good, it's not something I crave.  As other reviewers have noted, the decor is MUCH more elegant than it's exterior would suggest. It's a total diamond in the rough and a great place for a dinner date.  Their pricing is lower than most other Thai places, especially for one of this caliber.  The quality and presentation of the food is top notch."}
{"text":"The tom yum soup (w/tofu) in the fire bowl was out of this world!! I had never had tom yum served like this. Give me this and a side of rice (I like to throw rice in there for more substance and to decrease the surface area of my tongue affected by the spicy soup) and I can die spicy happy in love.   XOXOX TOM YUM!"}
{"text":"this is still my favorite thi restaurant don't let the outside scare you away it a grate place the drunken noodles are the best that I've had I get thi hot but still needs more heat the chicken curry is grate too my favorite is the sticky rice and coconut ice-cream service is hit or mis lately mis"}
{"text":"This has the best Thai tea we've had. Love it.   The fish cakes appetizer is full of the signature Thai flavors I love. They are a tiny bit spicy, with green onion all through it. You get 4 pieces for 9.95 I believe. I'm definitely getting that again.   Also, one of the best places for Pad Thai. It has great flavor, texture. The noodles aren't overly wet or too soft. This is our go-to place for Pad Thai. The chicken and shrimp comes with lots of chicken, but only 2 shrimp. So be quick if you eat family style.   Don't get the \"Thai spicy\" anything unless you actually can handle it.   I've been here a few times. Most everything was great. I just wasn't a fan of the fried tofu appetizer. It was pretty bland. I found that odd considering everything else I've had was enjoyable.   Don't skip this place. It's good."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever tasted in my life. Must order items are the Tom Kah (seafood), Pad Thai and Panang Curry. If you're a spice lover, go with Thai hot because the staff will scale back the spice level if you aren't thai. If you are, well you're in luck.   The beef salad is terrible, over priced and has no business being in such an establishment as Siam Thai."}
{"text":"WOW!  I rarely travel out to Glendale, but this will be the reason I do.  We had a group of 7 and everything came out great as well fast!  Great flavors and very authentic Thai food!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in phoenix. Hubby says it's the best Thai food he's had since coming back from Thailand. Amazing service, quality food, and good prices. We go here a MINIMUM of once a month, usually twice- and we only go out to eat on saturdays. The Pad Thai is to die for, and their fried bananas and coconut icecream is amazing."}
{"text":"Go for the panang! The Tom Yum was eh, the pineapple fried rice was a bit too greasy for my taste. But I would definitely go back for the panang. Delicious."}
{"text":"Great stuff! They aren't afraid to give you thai hot when you ask for it. Wonder flavors. Fast service."}
{"text":"Surprisingly elegant interior with a rough store front. The food was excellent and service was prompt. Delicious curry both red and green with huge portions."}
{"text":"I have been to this place probably a dozen times since my last review... I went tonight with a friend after taking her her the first time she has begun to crave it. Had the rad nad noodles (beef) and the garlic sauce (chicken) the chicken satay as a started and we followed with the sticky black rice and custard for desert. She had plum wine as well... Everything was excellent and we have lunch for tomorrow. This is my favorite place now. I have taken probably 5 different friends here and everyone loves it including a self proclaimed thai food expert! YUM"}
{"text":"The new chicken wings with papaya salad is soooooo delicious !! Extra crispy and juicy. The seafood Rad dish was exceptional. They are always extremely polite and always get our order correct even when we get it to go !"}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai in the Valley! The spicy basil, cashew nut, spicy noodle, and the soups are all divine! Spicy scale 1-5 we would usually go with a 4 or 5....but at Siam we go 2-3, we've gone 5 before and could barely finish and even 4 really pushes it. Regardless this place is legit!!"}
{"text":"This has become my husband and I'a new favorite spot. If you're bored of chain restaurants and your typical middle-eastern food this is a great way to switch it up! All their entrees are delicious and he soups are to die for."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! I have been going here since I was a freshman in high school. So over 10+ years. I grew up down the street from the restaurant where I attended high school at Apollo. I would always skip the period right after lunch just so I could sit down and enjoy my lunch. Even as an adult I always go there with my mother and sister and have quality time. The Silver Noodle Soup is a must!!!! I also love the Thai ice tea ( no milk). This is where i love to go to on my birthday..."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the staff is very friendly. I never have to wait to be seated and the food is brought out in a timely manner!"}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time until I moved to Deer Valley. Wife and I wanted Thai food last night and I thought it would be fun to go back and see if it was as good as I remember it. It was. They have the best Panang I've had anywhere. The distance doesn't matter anymore, we will be coming back more regularly from now on."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Thai place...anywhere. I love Thai food and have had my share of different Thai restaurants but the food here has raised the bar so high other places just don't quite compare. You must have some of their Lemon grass soup (I order mine with shrimp). If you're in the mood for noodles their Pad Thai is very tasty! And any one of their curries (red, yellow, or green). If you like Thai tea it is quite tasty but a bit on the sweet side. Whatever you order, you need to try this place!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and the good was incredible both times! We ordered Thai tom yum soup (w/ seafood), squid papaya salad, Lao style papaya salad and shrimp pad Thai. All were yummy! Very friendly and fast service. Looks like it's family owned & ran, best way to go! Visit them, worth the trip."}
{"text":"Excellent! Dun miss this spot Yelpers. Every single dish is just too good not to share. So you do not need to worry when come to order. I and my BFFs always came here for lunch / after school and we all love it. Can't find any places like this after moving away ."}
{"text":"We found this gem on July 5th using Yelp.  My wife says that this is the best Asian food she's had in Phoenix.  I tend to agree.    This is a pleasant, well decorated, neighborhood restaurant with great food and reasonable prices.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is great, and very reasonable on prices. Pretty sure this is my new favorite Thai place since \"The Pink Pepper\" shut down *shakes fist in anger*. We had the Tom Yum, mas-sa mun, and the meegrob. The soup and cury blew me away, but the meegrob was decent (that was the first time I had it, but my bf has had it in Chicago, and said it was okay). The rice served w the cury was really good, so was the Thai coffee. Very clean bathroom, great service, good portions, and minimal decorations left me wanting to visit again :)"}
{"text":"Do not fear the strip mall set up they are in! Dodge the seedy people and get yourself inside as quick as possible, for some of Arizona's best and authentic Thai food.   We came here for Mother's Day 2015, and knew we found \"the one\". My dad has been cooking with his Thai friend for years, so finding authentic Thai style can be hard, when you know what you're looking for.   Larb Gai was on spot, same with the Beef Salad. Sometimes Thai Restaurants make Beef Salad sweet (aka Americanized!), but this salad was perfect. The curries were all delicious- and to our spiciness expectations. Order a medium, you'll get medium. Hot is hot. You get the point.   My parents have came back multiple times, even bringing my grandmother, who had never had Thai before. The look on her face when she tasted the curry was priceless. For her birthday, guess where she wanted to go? Siam Thai. Who knew Thai food could reenergize a 75 year old Georgian grandmother."}
{"text":"This place by far is the best Thai food I've ever had! Every time i walk in i am always greeted. The dishes are well priced and the food is always flavorful! Every time i try a different place i always come back here... never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best thai food i've had, and has great service!"}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much on the outside, but it's very nice inside. Food is amazing! I am in love with the Pad Thai and I've never had a better egg roll!"}
{"text":"Finally!!! OUTSTANDING Thai cuisine and it happens to be in our Valley of the Sun! I originally tried Thai cuisine in LA in the early 1980's. Back then, the food was incredible and 'Thai Hot'. And I mean HOT but never to the point of not being able to taste the dish - that's important. I haven't really had as good Thai food since and I often eat Thai when I travel. There are many good and some great Thai restaurants out there but Siam Thai Cuisine is nothing short of spectacular. Beware, Hot is hot here, especially the marinated green mango salad but wow is it good. Definitely try the Angel Wings. This is one of those dishes that I could never find as good as some of the original restaurants in LA but Siam does it up right."}
{"text":"Again, I didn't feel like making the drive to Thai Hut, so I thought I'd give Siam Thai a whirl.  Other than the exterior, first impressions were very good. The dining room is lovely and comfortable -- lots of carved wood on the walls and heavy, substantial furniture.   We ordered some appetizers, and split an order of our favorite, pad kee mao.  The appetizers were of the fried variety, and not bad. Nice and hot, not too greasy.   We ordered the pad kee mao medium hot, and boy was it hot! Not in a bad way though. I was glad to see lots of thai basil and plenty of fresh veggies. But the sauce was lacking that complexity, and combination of spicy, sweet, and herbal that I love.  I did notice lots of people enjoying the soup. So perhaps that is their specialty. Maybe next time, when I don't feel like driving too far again."}
{"text":"As always, I was chilling in the desert in my B-boy stance and the office decided on Thai food for today. I was with it and gave Siam a chance since I hadn't really had real Thai restaurant food and what my Thai coworker brought in to the office really doesn't count. SIAM ROCKS IT. The service was great and the chicken Pad Thai was delish. I'm definitely going back to try some of the other dishes available. Haven't had good Thai food since moving from NYC but yeah, I'll be back. Sawadee."}
{"text":"Whoa! This place is bomb.com! Really great food and courteous staff.  The thai tea is on point.  If you are in the area do yourself a favor, and stop in.  I had quite a few things on the menu, and really have enjoyed it all. Great place."}
{"text":"Fantastic food across the board. For the brave, order your food \"Thai hot\", if you like spicy you're in for a treat. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just had the best Thai we've ever had! The cuisine is so good here. Hubby and son shared the pad see ew and the beef larb. I had the pad woon sen (which they call silver noodle). The best all of us have ever had!  The staff is very friendly, the restaurant is actually pretty nicely decorated (in that red carpet kinda way), and the bathrooms were immaculate!!! Also - there is a baby changing station in the women's room; as a mom, I love when I see that since changing a diaper on a bathroom floor just ticks me off.   Anyway - hubby and I agreed that this (and Mi Patio lol) is now on the list of restaurants we go to whenever we are in Phx.   Ps - only slight drawback to this restaurant is it's in a slightly rundown area."}
{"text":"Really really good. \"Medium\" is HOT. We will come again, delicious. Doesn't look like much from the outside but nice and cozy inside."}
{"text":"The flavors are good but I was a little disappointed with the spices. I asked for them to make my dishes as spicy as they can make it, not American spicy but Thai Spicy, but it came back mild and they stated that's as spicy as they can make their dishes. I'm a little disappointed since many of the reviews stated this was the best Thai restaurant in the Phoenix area, but I guess I should have listened to my wife and kept the bar low since I'm not in the Bay Area right now."}
{"text":"So it was our first time here, we ordered 2 Thai iced tea the drinks were really good although it needed more ice to keep it from staying warm, however the food!!  we ordered a spicy sea food soup that had a variety of seafood items, chicken fried rice that was delicious and also got chicken noodle that I thought had such an amazing flavor. Staff were friendly and helpful Definitely recommend this restaurant if you are craving Thai food."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai spots ever! I am a picky eater and let me just say! Fresh fresh fresh! And the food is down to the T on flavor! I get their Tom yum soup, spicy yellow curry,  and their chow me in is to die for! You have to try this place.."}
{"text":"Tried their stir fry eggplant today and it was good. All I have to say is they really like to put basil on everything. Also ordered the papaya salad. It had too much fish sauce and it made me gaggy. Pad thai is always the best"}
{"text":"The waitress did a bad job/took a long time with refilling my water and coming back to take our order. My wife's order of green curry was very good. My beef salad however, was horrible and tasted like I imagine cats shit would taste like. Between the bad waitress and horrible entree, 2 stars is all I can give this place."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very nice on the inside compared to the outside. I nice place for a date.  I ordered the tom kah gai and it was very flavorful, not quite as rich with coconut milk as at Thai Rama, but still very good. I ordered medium and this is probably closer to hot. As I ate, I noticed these things I thought were green onion, on further examination, they were small sliced chili peppers. Their rice was nit as fluffy as I usually like, but that's ok. I also got the red curry because the server said it was their most popular curry. Again, very flavorful and tasty. Service was very good, although, they weren't busy at all. Iced tea, was good. I would go again!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in the city of Glendale. It's in a grungy strip mall that most people would not stop or give a second look at. But, once you step in, the restaurant gives off a nice ambiance. The food is delicious. We got the Pad Thai and the Green Curry, which was more than  enough to feed 3 people for lunch. They dishes are approximately $10 to $15 each. They even have a brown rice option for the more health conscious. Our mango sticky rice at the end was a little lacking though. The amount was rather economical compared to its price. For entrees, this place is solid and authentic, but I would probably go elsewhere for dessert. We ate at rather an odd hour so the service was okay. Not spectacular but not lacking either."}
{"text":"OK, I have stopped by twice since the first review.  The service is still super friendly and welcoming.  The last time I came in, there was a large party seated near us that seemed to know next nothing about Thai food.  The staff was very patient with them.    Finally had the soup the last time I went.  At this point, I'm beginning to suspect that there is no such thing as bad lemon grass soup, because it really hit the spot.  So savory.  Went with my daughter, she gives it a thumbs up. We started with the fried tofu, which we both enjoyed.  They served up an impressive quantity of tofu. She ordered the Chow Mein Style Noodles with tofu, not something I would have ordered (why order a Chinese style dish here?), but it was pretty good. I ordered the Hot & Spicy Fried Rice With basil (and tofu).  Kinda wish I hadn't been with my daughter, because I got it mild.  Still tasty and fresh, but next time I'll order it hot.    We finished with the Coconut Ice Cream with Sticky Rice (or, as I have seen it named elsewhere, Snow Ball With Purple Rain).  This is a fantastic dessert.  If you've never had sticky rice, you have to try this.  The cold ice cream with the warm rice is spectacular.    OK, I had a late dinner at home tonight, but just typing out this review is making my mouth water.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Ordered the pad Thai. This is one of the few Thai restaurants who ACTUALLY makes it that hot , which and be a good or bad thing depending on your preference . But it was most excellent. The tea was awesome ,and my dinning companion ordered the sweet and sour fish, he said it was very tasty. The presentation was very colorful.  I would recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Food 3.5, Atmosphere 3, Service, 3 Price, Thai Spicy 1   The outside is a tore up strip mall that should be tore down and redone at this point. The inside is very decorated. Theres plenty of booths and tables and a tv with sports on.   The service was ok. It took a while but there was only one lady waiting and she was very polite and helpful.   The food had some nice flavors. A little chincy on the meat and shrimp but not on the herbs and seasoning.   The price wasn't half bad. The couple of times I been there I never felt like I was taken advantage of.   The one thing I can say I didn't like was the heat. When I go to a Thai spot and ask for it to be Thai spicy I don't mean Thai spicy for a guy that grew up in the Midwest. I mean Thai spicy for a guy that grew up in the southwest eating chiles for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. Where is the heat??   Other than that I would go back to try more of the menu. Maybe next time I will go to the kitchen and tell the chef to please hurt me with the spice next time."}
{"text":"I love this place! Gang ga ree is yumma dumm dumm!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. A slight modern take on Thai cuisine, but not too modern. It's also pretty elegant inside. I loved it!"}
{"text":"I just found this place about 2 weekds ago and I have been here twice already. It is about a 40 minutes drive for me but well worth it. The strip mall it is in is very ghetto.   Food here is a little on the hot side so be warned.... Medium is more like HOT.   I love the appetizer platter that has a little bit of everything. The fried tofu is sooo yummy.  I can order that for my dinner and be satisfied. The Thai Spicy fried rice is really flavorfull. I like their fried catfish with some red sauce... Very good as well.  The next time I go I am getting green curry with beef..."}
{"text":"This place is easy to miss but once inside you are greeted with a fantastic decorative interior. The service is great. I get the Pad Thai noodles with shrimp and it's one of the best Pad Thais I've ever had! I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food was 5 stars! Fresh, tasty and plentiful. The service was 4 stars due to a couple mix-ups. We kept telling our waitress we wanted brown rice and I had to go to the kitchen after they forgot to bring it out to us twice. The ambiance was simple and they had cloth napkins. I would return."}
{"text":"Duck with curry and pineapple, medium spiciness...but I thought that it was very harshly spiced... but everyone else seems to like it...so maybe it's just me."}
{"text":"I had been here before with a group last year & was very good.  The only complaint I had was that I ordered an eggplant dish (mild) but when it came it was waaaayyy tooo HOT!  She didn't want to make it right by taking it back & making it less hot...  I got the feeling they're a little snobbish.  I got up and left!!"}
{"text":"This place has great reviews. It is in a small  shopping  center and outside  the restaurant  looks like a dive. Inside  is much more pleasant . The place has room for only 70 . Service was quick and our order of 6 dishes came quickly.  I did not like rhe fried wanton or the stuffed chicken  wings.  I liked the spicy green beans , it was barely cooked that is how I like my vegatables. I also liked their garlic shrimp. It was loaded with garlic and basil. Their pad Thai was average. Portion was small. We also had their coconut  ice  cream with sticky  rice this was interesting.  I would rate the restaurant  3.5 stars . What I did not like that the added 20 % tip and then brought  the  charge slip that did not show the tip. I will  try again but it is not the best Thai restaurant  in town"}
{"text":"More proof that you can't judge a book by its cover or a restaurant by its strip mall.  This establishment could easily do a booming business in Scottsdale or Paradise Valley, but thank goodness they're here in Glendale and close to my house.  Tonight we had our usual coconut & chicken soup, served in the flaming hot pot.  It's a flavorful concoction brimming with chicken, mushrooms, fresh basil and herbs in a delicious lemony coconut broth.  The hubby had the stir-fried broccoli and beef, and I had the Shrimp and Pineapple curry.  I have to say that my curry dish was the absolute best Thai food I've had here in the Valley, thanks to the huge shrimp, big chunks of pineapple and fresh basil.  For desert we had the sticky rice and custard, served piping hot--delicious!  Although it was Sunday night, the place was almost packed with a steady stream of customers.  The waitstaff are all very courteous and patient, and they are quick to help decipher items on the menu that are unfamiliar to the diners.  There were a lot of people there who were obviously regulars judging from the banter between them and the waitstaff.  The restaurant is on the small side, with a total occupancy of 70. Just the perfect size make it accessible with a neighborhood feel.  We love the place and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good Thai restaurant for a couple of year in the Northwest valley.  I think we have found our place.  It does not look promising when you pull into the parking lot but don't judge a book by it's cover, this place is very clean inside and has very good food.  We started off with the Siamese appetizer. and one glass of wine.  Probably too much food for the two of us but we were hungry and ate it all.  All of the items were tasty but my favorite was some type of fried pork toast!  Probably not the healthiest thing but it was like fried French toast with pork.  All the sauces were good as well but was not sure what to do with the cucumber jalapeno salad thing so we just ate it as it was.  It was not spicy.  My wife had chicken Pad Thai.  (skipped the shrimp) it was the best she has had in our 2 years in PHX!  She asked for \"no spicy\" and it was perfect.  It was a very generous helping.  I had the red curry fish with brown rice, medium spicy, and it was also very good.  Medium spicy was just enough to have me wiping my brow about half way through.  Not overpowering but after several bites, you could feel it.  That was perfect for me.  Finished off the meal with a Thai Iced Coffee and they had to roll me out of there.  Two dinners, a large appetizer platter, a glass of wine and an iced coffee for $49.  We will be back again!!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Thai restaurant. I've tried other ones but they didn't have much flavor. The staff is friendly and they've never once messed up orders; and I've been coming here for years."}
{"text":"I always enjoy this restaurant!   I love the Pad Woon Sen- clear noodle dish stir fried with veggies and protein of choice. I like it with chicken! I add their hot and spicy fish sauce to it for extra kick. Delicious!   Great variety on the menu, very nice friendly staff and I love the decor. Definitely one of the best Thai restaurants on the west side!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow, this place is delicious, had the fried banana for dessert and it was so good, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to check out. Foods good, place is quiet, service is polite, but a bit slow. Im ok with it though, gives you tome to socialize without an interruption."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, clean restaurant, great food. My wife ordered a spicy shrimp salad which she loved. I ordered the pad see you (?) which was a wide noodle with chicken. It was excellent.  My wife's mother had Pad Thai with chicken and she said it was to die for. The coconut ice cream was excellent."}
{"text":"Was hestate at first because of its location in a strip mall, but was pleasantly surprised with the everything about the place!!!  Food was excelllent, service was terrific, and restaurant was clean. Some of the best Thai food I have ever had!"}
{"text":"The pad Thai was AMAZING!! Probably one of the best pad Thai I've ever had. It was also a large portion, so it's enough for two people. The Thai tea was also really good, not super sweet."}
{"text":"I love it, always get the Pad Thai. Flavor is amazing, great portion size and the service is always on point. The only reason I'm not giving a five star rating is because, every time I order food to go, the order is wrong. Lol, it's not really a big deal, the food still takes good but it's always off somehow."}
{"text":"The strip mall that Siam is in really sucks. Your first impression, when you park, is going to be suspicion. Everything in the plaza is a little roughed up, dirty, and out of date. But when you actually enter the restaurant, you're suddenly in a relaxing oasis of carved and stained wood panels, excellent tables, and attentive staff. The interior of a nice restaurant was teleported into a pit of suburban decay, and you forget what the exterior of the restaurant looks like the moment you're inside and enjoying the decor and gentle lighting.   Five stars with an asterisk: not everything on the menu is great. I give it five stars because it gives me what I want every time: curry and thai iced tea. Their tom yum is also pretty decent, and the presentation with the fiery soup bowl is always impressive. And the dessert with the coconut ice cream and the fried banana is pretty stellar. But I've also had friends order some items, like the fish cakes, with less than amazing results. Don't order the fish cakes. It's hard to point out any one problem with them, because no element of the dish was successful.  Additional warning: thai hot is hotter than you want. You don't have anything to prove. Thai hot will give you a nice rush and burn your mouth, but more urgently, it will jack up your insides. If you're going to order that way, bring immodium. I'm not joking. Regular hot is fine, but you're going to want medication if you try and show off."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. I don't even know how other thai places in glendale stay in business, the food here beats the competition by far.   My favorite dishes are the Green Curry (with beef, chicken, or tofu) and the Pad Thai is amazing, its not overly sweet or saucey like many of the other places out there.  They use alot of thai basil and fresh herds which is amazing, the flavors are really well blended with the perfect amount of spice. I always get the medium spice and its always been perfect. its not just some chili flakes that they put in for spiciness, its actually chilies and other spices that blend with the meal.  The eggplant dish is also very good, but hands down the green curry is my favorite.  Always fresh veggies and never frozen.   The location is a little scary, but one you taste the food its well worth it. Its actually really nice inside, the outside doesnt look inviting but like it said, it is well worth it!  Decent Prices as well, maybe a tad bit pricer like a dollar or two but its well worth it."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited today for lunch solely because of it's Yelp rating and because it's fairly close by but mainly because of yelp. From the outside, the place has absolutely NO curb appeal.  Still though we went in, trusting in 105 yelp reviewers and walking inside was like walking into another world...Very, very nice.  Very nicely decorated.  Service was fast and efficient.  We were well looked after by the wait staff.   I had an old favorite, pad thai.  That's usually the bench mark I use for measuring how good food is.  The pad thai was excellent.  Had it with chicken but there were some shrimp thrown in.  Got the medium heat and it was delicous!! Wife had one of the currys.  Ordered medium heat but she said that, while absolutely delicious, it wasn't as hot as she'd like it although she, too, had ordered medium.  Could be a mistake in the kitchen.  Anyway she said it was delicious. as well. We also got some egg rolls.  There were two of them and they were wonderful as well.  They come with a fruit sauce which was ever so delicate.  Very lightly pink but we couldn't tell from which fruit it came. The whole entire meal exceeded our expectations well beyond what we even hoped for. We both decided that this restaurant will go on our absolutely- must- revisit list."}
{"text":"It doesn't look great from the outside, but the inside is very nice and welcoming. I got the yellow curry with pork and it was very good, and we also got the Thai egg rolls as an appetizer, which were delicious and obviously fresh. It was my first time trying Thai food, and I was glad I came here for it. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Would recommend to anyone. Never had anything off the menu that I didn't like, my fav is the tofu friend rice mmm mmm mmm. And I absolutely love their Thai iced tea.. come give this place a try, you will be coming back for more and more.."}
{"text":"Who knew they actually had at least one really legit Thai restaurant in AZ?! I would have never guess, until I walked into this little gem.   My husband was the one to find this place and I am SO glad he did. Any place that has an option to have you food \"Thai hot\" is alright with me! Some places we would eat Thai food, we would request to make it hotter than their hottest option because most of the time their version of \"hot\" was more like 3 out of 5 stars. This place does not disappoint on the hot factor. Thai food is my favorite and if you speak to any Thai person, they like everything hot, so it is a complete disservice if you don't eat their food hot because it only enhances the flavor.   Our service was fantastic, our waitress caught on to our humor pretty quick and she was joking around with us too. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and they were even very conscientious of our kids, speaking with them directly. I always like that. We ordered our staples, chicken stay, pad see yew, and beef red curry. All amazing. The only other place I have had Thai food this good was at a family party- no joke. I'm amazed because I've lived in a few places where Thai food, and people, were everywhere and this place is right up there with the best Thai food I've ever had. The place is still very hole-in-the wall and we had to travel from Anthem to get here, but it was well wroth it and will be worth it every time we come back. Who knew some of the best Thai food you can find in is Phoenix? It seriously rivals places in LA, you MUST try this place out if you are a fan of authenticity."}
{"text":"Awesome.  Thai egg rolls and spicy pork noodles.  Amazing.  The girls that were split the waitressing duties were also VERY amazing!  Attentive and extremely polite.  I will definitely be going back.  Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"I have lived down the street from this place for 10 years and never been in.... I have been missing out! Don't let the outside detour you from going in.    They were very friendly when we came in and we were seated right away.  I had a Thai Tea (which is very helpful in calming the fire in your mouth if you order medium spice!)  The fried tofu was the best I've had!  We also got the Pad Thai and the yellow curry.  We ordered them a medium heat and the medium is not for the faint of heart.  I love spicy Thai food but this made me sweat!  Still delicious, just caution to those ordering. The portions were really big so we have plenty of leftovers.   We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"We chose this Thai restaurant based on the other reviews and WOW!!! Great choice, total hole in the wall with some of the best Thai food I've ever eaten. The green curry was delish and the others in our party all loved their dishes as well. Great range in mild to hot! Great service as well!!!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai food.  So glad to have found this place!!!  This is the only Thai restaurant I'll choose to go to in the Phoenix area.  I love their Phad Kee Mao.  Everything I've had has been 5 stars so far.  Their Thai Iced Tea is yummy too."}
{"text":"Top notch, real deal Thai. Family owned the pride shows in the food, service and decor. White linen tablecloths and napkins. Best Thai I have ever had and that is why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Best Thai in the west valley it compares to my favorite Thai restaurants in cali, my husband and I always say if their pad Thai and curry are delicious then everything else is too!"}
{"text":"MMM! Can you say delicious? You actually won't be saying anything because your mouth will be full of Pad Thai and the Coconut Milk Curry soup! This place was introduced to me by a friend who threw her anniversary party here and it was the best place for service!  I absolutely love the Thai Tea and Thai Coffee they serve. It is a definite on the menu of items to try.   I absolutely love the decor. Very ornate and very clean!"}
{"text":"I've driven past this place countless times and have never been tempted to try it out. It just seemed so sketchy, tucked away in that nondescript little strip mall. But...my mom had a coupon. I just can't deny her the joy she gets from using her coupons. So, we gave it a try.   From the outside, we were still unsure that the lure of the coupon would be enough, but we ventured in anyway. Inside we were surprised to find a nice, quiet little dining space. Aside from a family party that appeared to be finishing up their meal, we were the only people there, so we were seated and served very quickly. By the time we placed our order, we were a little relieved to see that other patrons were slowly filling up the dining room. There was only one waitress, but she still came by to check on us a few times, even after it got busy.   The menu looked great; there were so many choices! We ended up ordering the Ginger Chicken and the Spicy Green Beans with beef. Both dishes were fantastic. I just loved how they took a simple combo of meat and veggies and transformed it with an explosion of spices. I'm a big fan of spicy foods, but I hate it when restaurants just turn up the heat while ignoring the flavor of the dish. The spicy green beans were a perfect blend. The portions were huge; mom and I each took home some leftovers that were enough for lunch the next day. I can't wait to come back and try something new!"}
{"text":"I was kind of doubtful when I walk into the restaurant seeing how nicely the table is set up with the folded napkin. \"uh-oh, i hope the food is not Americanized\"  Was disappointed  with the food. We order fish cake, which is kind of salty to me. The papaya salad was not I had expected it to be. It was thickly cut compared to other papaya salad that I have had before. The taste was just sour, nothing special. Other entree we order include steak beef and the tom yum hot pot. Tom yum soup was good for me, with mushrooms and seafood and the broth is not as spicy. I did not like the steak beef, they simply just stir fry it with bell pepper.  Have to agree with Tram below, their price is not bad. Dinner feeding 5 people all under $60."}
{"text":"So at first glance. You think how does this place have so many great reviews for the area it's located. It's a lot larger than it seems and the food was great. That's when you can easily see why they have so many reviews. Had the Pad Thai which their medium still has a little spice to it."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever eaten here is delicious. You can't go wrong with any dish. Do it!"}
{"text":"They have a small table shoved in the corner that's kind of odd and really shoved in and when we arrived maybe 1/2 the tables were filled and the server said we could have the regular table or the little corner one so I picked the regular table and then she said we couldn't have it and settled for the shoved in corner table. I wouldn't have mentioned this in my review but I did because the very next couple that came in she allowed them to have the table I wanted. I'm not removing stars for that but that is what happened.  We ordered egg rolls that came out fast and were good.  I ordered the Pad Gra Pow. I liked that they added a nice selection of fresh vegetables to it and the sliced white meat chicken was cooked nice and wasn't dry. This dish tasted good but lacked enough Basil and that is the point to this dish.  Also this dish is traditionally made with hand chopped chicken that has more surface and gets more infused with flavor than sliced chicken so that would have been better. I liked that they offer brown rice so I ordered brown rice however the up charge was $2.00.  My husband ordered the Hot and spicy noodles with beef. The dish was fresh and interesting but the beef was a little tough and chewy and not too developed with flavor.   I was here before and had one of the curry dishes and liked that much more than the dishes we just had and would have given a higher rating if we ordered different dishes.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Favorite Thai restaurant in town, hands down. Authentic and delicious! Been going here for over 5 years. Love the curry!"}
{"text":"I came with a group of 28 people for a coworker. We were all worried that we wouldn't see our food for an hour, but they amazed us, our food was coming out quickly and it was very good. I ordered the Shrimp Fried Rice and it was one of the best that I have had and the shrimp were rather large. They have unseated our defacto Thai restaurant and will now become of our our regular spots."}
{"text":"Love this place. I had the eggplant dish and was very delicious. My oldest brother had the catfish and my other brother had red curry beef. Everything was so good that all the plates were empty. We came here to celebrate the holidays with family before they went back to texas and they loved it. I consider myself a regular now and this little diamond in the rough is the best Thai food I've had since moving here in az."}
{"text":"Pretty bomb Thai food. Their Thai food is better than some places I've been to before. Definitely should try the Thai tea. It's pretty good. I'd say they have the better Thai tea compared to another place I have been too. Good atmosphere. Darling lighting so it would be cute for a date. I went with friends, but it was still fun! :)"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Thai restaurant. To say the food is amazing is an understatement. I highly recommend any of the curry dishes, any of the soups, the Thai teas and the coconut ice cream. I can't wait to try more dishes! And the prices are so good, great deal for a great meal! Cute atmosphere and friendly staff as well :)"}
{"text":"I wish you could put half stars. This was excellent food and service and I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. I was up in Phoenix buying a car and I found this place on yelp. I had the Kra Pao with tofu and tofu fried rice. It was soooo delicious. I wish I lived closer. I would be here all the time. The Thai iced tea and all the food was delicious. My friend had the Papaya salad and he also liked his food too. Nothing bad to say about this place and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Back in the mid-1980s when I first came to AZ, I used to go to Siam a lot.  I was stationed at Luke AFB and my boss out there was friends with the gentleman who owned the place and his wife, who was from Thailand.  It was my first exposure to the joys and wonders of Thai food and I have been hooked every since. Sadly, I did not go back after my friend left Luke and it was over 25 years since I last stepped foot into the place.  I have eaten at several other places which were mediocre at best, and I said many times to my family, \"You know, we should go to the Siam\".  We did not, only because it is a bit of a drive.  I went back last night.  WHY DID I STAY AWAY SO LONG!!  It has not changed from the way I remember it.  The service was first class, the food was out in less than 15 minutes, piping hot and was by far THE BEST Thai food I have had outside of Thailand - I have been in Thailand several times and eaten off the street vendors. The egg rolls were crispy and fresh and tasty and hot.   I had Thai spicy rice noodles with fresh basil and the flavor was amazing, it was fresh and dripping with flavors.  My son had the pad Thai and was in love.  The portions were large, and for two of us with full bellies it was $26 and some change.  I will be taking my wife there really soon.  This time, I won't be staying away for so long."}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough. Sketchy neighborhood, but awesome inside. Amazing food!!! Love this place"}
{"text":"I was looking so forward to dining here with the awesome Yelp reviews. Service was good, but the food was MEH.  Rating is combined with service and food.  Recommend: Peanut like flavored curry with chicken.    NOT Recommended: * I was not a fan of the papaya salad, it was overly drenched with prominent fish sauce and it seemed as though the salad may have been sitting out for a long while. Typically fresh Thai papya salad is firm, crisp...this lacked that.    * The Pad See Ew: noodle dish that has a charred sauce flavor was lacking in the sauce and the garnishment of peanuts.  I had the beef and it was dry, tough and had hard sinew. It was not at all appetizing and the noodles typically with this dish is a rice noodle that is flat, long, wide and absorbs and retains the sauce. This noodle was cut up in like 1 inch or less lengths, it did the opposite affect.  * Rice with the order was also underdone.  I LOVE authentic Thai food and Siam Thai underwhelmed in authenticity, portion size is very small, including the meat servings you may get 2-3  bits of meat/shrimp."}
{"text":"Honestly, I fricking love this place! The food is delicious. The only time I have ever disliked something here was when I ordered the Thom Yum vegetarian, but other than that.... LOVE the Thom Yum and the Thom Ka- great with chicken (and I hate chicken), really good with shrimp. The last time I ate here the shrimp seemed to be a lot better quality than a few years ago- so I'm pretty stoked for that, because a lot of places have really gross shrimp in Phoenix... you know that mushy shrimp that just seems icky... icky... right? That describes it? Icky shrimp. The shrimp they served me last time were plump and juicy and really good.  The fried rice dishes, excellent. The curries... pretty darn good. Pad Thai... yum... Cashew dishes, basil dishes... all GOOD. We always order extra veggies on just about everything and they always happily accommodate us with excellent fresh, perfectly al dente.  The area where you can find this awesome Thai restaurant may be described as pretty much, super ghetto- and beware, one day the guy that owns the liquor store next door came out and picked a fight with us for parking in front of his store, when he was closed for the day... That dudes a dick.  But, really, if you are on the West Side- this is definitely a good spot. I used to think Thai Rama was the stuff, but I think I prefer Siam now... Sorry Thai Rama.  My one gripe. Every single time I eat here, I ask for extra chili paste because my guy can't handle as much heat as me, so we end up ordering everything medium for his Caucasian palate- every single time they forget to bring the chili paste. But, what are you going to do? They will eventually bring it, we just have to ask again. My boyfriend said he figured out the secret- you have to ask for the chili paste when they bring your food out, or they will always forget.  One more thing, did I mention the servers are really nice, big smiles, very friendly... - 5 stars earned!"}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Thai you'll find in Arizona! Simple, powerful flavors and genuine service. I love it here. It's the closest thing to going to Thailand. Recommended to me by a friend from Chiangmai, I take all my friends who would appreciate good Thai food here.  and you have to have a coconut sticky rice dessert .. whether its with custard or mango, its so so so good. dont tell any one else to come to this little secret place though."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food in Phoenix! That's to bulls were very fresh and crisp and service could've been a little better. But I think there may have been a language barrier... The mango sticky rice for dessert was out of this world! However the pad Thai was a little too sweet for my taste.  The spice level was more on the mild side! I ordered a medium and it was pretty mild.  I'm used to us spice level one thru five..."}
{"text":"Relatively new to the area, I have looked high and low for an authentic Thai restaurant equal to what I've come to enjoy in LA, the Bay Area and Bangkok, where I have lived in past times. Siam Thai is the real deal. AuthentIc Thai cuisine with nice decor and ambience, and they are not afraid to kick up the heat! If you want a genuine NON-Americanized Thai culinary experience, Siam Thai delivers in spades."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai you will have in Phoenix.definitely worth the drive if it's not close to you. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"The food was good. The portions were great too, not too much, just the right amount.  I had chicken satay, I could have use more peanut sauce, but I tend to use too much of that stuff anyways. The cucumber salad also has Jalapeño slices in it which gives it a nice kick. For my entree, I had the green curry with Tofu."}
{"text":"Tried this Thai restaurant for the first time. Service was a little slow at first but the food makes up for it!! Delicious."}
{"text":"Came in today around 2 PM with a party of 3. It was great! The service was quick and polite! Ordered the pad thai medium spice  which is AMAZING! It is a little bit more sweeter than other places but it's still great in my books. I also ordered durian and coconut ice cream to share amongst the 3 of us which was more than enough. The ice cream is made at the restaurant which is impressive! My overall experience was 10/10 with no complaints... for now.  Pad thai ($10 - $12)- sweeter than the usual but still good. Durian ice cream - creamy, strong taste but after taste is good Coconut - creamy with some coconut chunks"}
{"text":"This easy-to-miss place is run perfectly.   We go for special occasions as I usually don't eat out. The service and food are excellent.  The inside of the restaurant looks fantastic and the wait staff are very attentive.  The food never fails to be cooked perfectly.  As you drive up, you may seem suspicious as it's not in a good location, but fear not, once you walk inside you'll be very glad you went."}
{"text":"I found this place while browsing on yelp.  It is AMAZING!  I had the yellow curry and thai iced tea (my go-to for any thai restaurant) and it was delicious!  My friend really enjoyed his meal too.  Definitely a place worth checking out!"}
{"text":"It was our first visit to Siam Thai and just let me say it won't be our last.  Don't let the outside appearance fool you. The inside was cool, clean and welcoming. We were greeted and seated almost immediately. After perusing the menu we ordered a Spring Roll appetizer, Pad Thai for my wife and Green Curry (med heat) for myself. Everything was delicious and the heat level on my curry was spot on. Hot would have a bit too much (for me) and Thai Hot would have been out of the question. Our waitress answered all of our questions and the service was very good with frequent visits for water and tea refills."}
{"text":"You just never know what you're getting until you look under the hood...  Friend of mine brought me here for lunch the other day and not being a good Yelper I did not look up any of the reviews prior to going.  To my surprise when I pulled up to this place yes it looks a little dumpy however the inside is really nice.  The ambience, service, and food were all very very nice.    Food; For starters you must try the lemongrass soup and also their spring rolls.  I recommend you get Phad Thai or go with chicken and/or tofu green curry or red curry.  Their green curry sauce is one of the best in Phoenix.  Everything we tried was D Lish!  Restaurant;  Like I stated earlier, don't judge a book by its cover, The restaurant is well decorated, the decor is very nice and the ambience is nice.   We found the service on this day excellent.  Our server was very attentive and she was very knowledgeable about their menu.  She made some great recommendations.    After reading other Yelper reviews it would appear that this place has listened to some of their feedback.  I found this place to be a little hidden gem in Phoenix.    I'm looking forward to my next visit and I hope to see you there very soon."}
{"text":"My favorite out of ALL the other Thai restaurants I have tried.. and I've tried a lot of Thai restaurants & none of them can come close to Siam. I'm a regular there and the waitresses always greet me so kindly with a smile and a happy tone. I love their food, especially their Red Curry Chicken OMG to die for."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in Phoenix.  Just accept it and don't argue!!!  I ate at another restaurant across town, and it only served to remind me how awesome this place is compared to everywhere else...  I've been coming here since I first moved to Phoenix - probably eaten here at least 10 times.  Favorites are the pad Thai and duck curry - though their other curries are good too.  It's in a shady complex, but is really nice on the inside and the staff is super friendly.  If you are into Thai food - do yourself a favor and check this place out."}
{"text":"First time here and can definitely say I will be back! The food was delicious, we had the pineapple fried rice, green chicken curry and the Tom Yung Goong soup and everything was fresh, cooked perfectly and the spice was just right too! It's definitely a place worth trying if you been looking for good Thai food in the West Valley."}
{"text":"This place is good. I won't say great, but it's quite good. I wish they had vegetarian spring rolls. The only veg appetizer is the fried tofu, but when every entree you're ordering already has tofu in it, you don't really need tofu as an appetizer on top of it. I've been here about 3 times. It's good Thai food and worth a trip, but nothing sensational. Staff is great. The atmosphere could use a kick -- it's very dark and outdated looking on the inside, plus it's in a very nondescript strip mall. The staff is attentive though and very pleasant, and I would recommend this place if you were in the neighborhood, but wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"This is my go to Thai place in the entire valley.  I always order drunken noodles, spice level 4, and orange curry.  Both are delicious every time.  Last time I went, I also got a Thai tea, and she didn't even charge me for it.  BONUS!"}
{"text":"Best Thai on the Westside! I haven't tried every item on their menu, but everything I have has been on point.  I've dined in as well as ordered to go, and the service is always fast and friendly. You can't go wrong with their pad thai or curries, always delicious!"}
{"text":"Chicken & Pork Pad Thai is the best. Great for family dinner. Service is friendly and quick. This was our second time to Siam and there food was consistently good both times."}
{"text":"So yummy some of the best Thai I have had in the valley. Been twice now in the past two weeks!!"}
{"text":"As I thought, this place is really a 4.  I have been back a few times now and have discovered if I get there by 11:15 my food comes out pretty quick and I can take my time eating.  They still only have one waitress at lunch but I have never seen more than 1/3 of the tables occupied at one time going early so it works fine."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Arizona I'd come to this place to eat Thai food. I usually order their tom yum soup, red curry, and shrimp pad Thai. It's one of the better Thai food places I've experienced here in Arizona."}
{"text":"If you love Thai food you will LOVE this place. Located in a run down strip mall just the appearance alone might be enough to have you running for the hills....but go ahead and park, the food will more than make up for the outside aesthetic. Once inside you're welcomed by a warm and inviting atmosphere filled with carved wood panels and silk table covers. We tried the yellow curry shrimp and hot and spicy beef and noodles (hot is HOT!). Worth a trip, they just made it to the top of our list of favorites in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Severs here are very polite. Once time, they made cashew chicken way too spicy for my son. He loves medium but it tasted like hot. ( we order this all the time so now we can tell the difference.) We told our server that and they remade it for him so quickly with no charge. I love Pad See Ew with tofu. I have tried this dish from other Thai restaurants but Siam has the best one! Their Pad Thai is always good, too. Food comes in huge portion!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town. Me and my family have been coming here for years. Do not be fooled by location and outside visual of restaurant. This place is a diamond in the rough. We enjoy their soups, their curry, their pad Thai, the sticky rice, egg rolls.... fair pricing as well."}
{"text":"While this is my first review, I have eaten here many times over the years and the food has always been 4 and 5 stars (today, was no exception) and the wait staff always friendly. However, the reason for only a 3 star rating is 3 fold. With my To Go order of Cashew Chicken, Medium and Pad Thai Chicken, Medium, the orders were messed up royally. Perhaps, it was because the place was very busy (over 30 people at 12:30 on Sunday afternoon). But, the waitress confirmed my order and I took it home. But, when I got home and heated up the entrees, I had 3 Surprises. The Cashew Chicken had only 3 Cashews in it; the Pad Thai was Chicken and Shrimp (only 2; and it's a good thing that we are not allergic to sea food). Now, my family and I like Spicy, but knowing Thai cooking the way I do, I was like, \"WHOA!.  If this was Medium, what on Earth would they consider Spicy?\" While I was able to eat it, my family was not. :( And, knowing what the next day or two will cost me, I ended up throwing the rest of it out. :( A shame to spend $$ on something that had to be thrown out. But, I will go back, again."}
{"text":"Nothing close to the Thai food I've had in California. The curry wasn't rich and flavorful. The other two dishes didn't meet my expectations either."}
{"text":"I've spent about 2.5 months in SE Asia, including taking cooking classes in Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. I seek out authenticity in flavors and not Western adaptations.  Siam meets this mark. The papaya salad was delightfully spicy, and the tom yum soup was as sour here as it was in Chiang Mai.  The atmosphere is nice and a welcome surprise from looking at the outside. The staff were kind and attentive. Happy to have this place in the area!"}
{"text":"I think I found my new Thai place. I also feel like I'm cheating on my old Thai place. LoL. I walked in and was greeted right away. I was already armed with what I wanted and ordered to-go. She was very nice and quickly passed on the order to another woman who gave it to the cook. The dining area was clean, quiet, dark and cool. There was a flat screen playing AMC (yay! I have no use for sports). There were a couple diners and listening to the waitress take one women and older gentlemans order, she was super patient. Explained everything to them and adjusted the order as needed. To me, its not just how they treat me, but others when they don't know their being observed.   I ordered Vegetable Red Curry (Yea, I'm obsessed with curry). I just said Hot, not sure if they go by number system or what. I waited about 5mins., in that time a couple to go orders were picked up - good sign, since it was 4pm yet. Not quite dinner time for most. Telling me it could get busy during peak hours.  I got home and opened my containers. First, the rice they give is a very large portion! It looked like 4 scoops. The Curry is also a large serving, good for two people or for two meals. It was filled with large vegetable pieces - carrots, snow peas, broccolli, etc. And it was HOT!! I was sniffling and sweating - omg! It was perfect! I had to stop and grab the fan and sit in front of it!  This place I will definently be going back to. Its a lot closer and a straight shot for me. Only 4 stars because I did only try one dish. I'm looking foward to trying the Beef Salad, Wonton Soup and other interesting dishes they have.  Update 9.3.13 - So I decided to dine in...and learned my lesson. I was seated quickly and just as quickly forgotten. Luckily I brought a book to read. The lady who sat me just walked away. Than a couple minutes later she sat a couple and quickly got their drink orders. I was a bit annoyed. But then another lady (Lek) appeared from the back 5-10mins later, she quickly got my order and gave me a glass of water.  Wonton Soup: First it is HUGE, omg I was embaressed becuase it was just me. Lek was like don't worry, you can take the rest home. Its good for 3+ people, and its only one size. It was really flavorful, had the huge chunks of vegetables, corn, carrots, leeks, etc. No spice to it and it was delicious!  Beef Salad: It wasn't a typical salad...when I think salad, I think lettuce with everything else. This came wiith slices of cucumber, tomato and a wedge of cabbage. It was a good portion sized and super hot! I didn't care for the cabbage, but with the cucumber/tomato was good. I actually went and bought a cucumber to eat with the beef salad the next day. A couple pieces were chewy, but upon inspection, (gross I know lol) it was the fatty part of the meat. It seems they don't trim off those parts.  Over all it was still a delicious meal, and Lek serving me improved my mood. She helped me the first time I came to this restaurant. Very nice and helpful, quickly bringing me anything I might need."}
{"text":"Love this place! Closed Mondays. I always get Penang and/or cashew chicken. Love that they have sticky rice."}
{"text":"Drove by this restaurant so many time but did not know Yelpers love it so much! =)   I went there for dinner with my sister and friends.  We had the seafood hot pot ( i love the broth), pad thai, papaya salad and hot and spicy noodle.    Seafood hot pot: the broth is really good- the seafood is ok, normally it would come with more greens- but this pot only contains various sea creatures and the broth. Pad thai- terrible! too sweet Papaya salad- it was ok, not great, and definitely spicy for a medium. Hot and Spicy noodle- delish!! I clean the plate good!!! i highly recommend this dish!   The setting is nice, clean and has imported Thai art around the restaurant. You get tamarind candies instead of fortune cookies =D YAY!!!    The price isn't bad- there were four of us, 1 appetizer, 4 entrees, 2 thai tea and the total came out $50.  Not bad at all."}
{"text":"My friend from Thailand took me here, I figure he has to know good Thai food right?  I have been going back ever since.  The red curry and green curry are both excellent.  The service is great and the place is clean.  The pad thai is above average."}
{"text":"OMG! The yellow chicken curry is fantastic. I moved here from Los Angeles in February and have searched around for the right place to buy awesome Thai food and I am so glad I found it on the first shot. The food here reminds me of the great tastes you can find in California."}
{"text":"Green Curry and Pad Thai.  Never come for anything else, because these two dishes here are just absolutely amazing.  I had octopus as an appetizer and it was cooked really well (though I am not a huge fan of this kind of seafood).   You will enjoy it!  I promise."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! I love a good curry and this place beats them all! The Pineapple Duck Curry is one of their best, along with the Red Curry. Their Pad Thai is also phenomenal. And the Thai Tea...oh, the Thai Tea! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food.. one of the best in my opinion.  Like some reviews  say, the outside doesn't  do it justice. They have great food at fair prices. Give them a try and you won't  be disappointed. I would recommend  the dish with the catfish with green beans and the pineapple curry."}
{"text":"Wow! The food and service was amazing! They even let us come in a bit before they opened. I went with 3 other people we ordered an appetizer and 3 entree. Let's just say we did not finish our food.... so much food!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai I've ever had and certainly the best I've had in Phoenix. Don't be discouraged by the location or its outward appearance. The food is AMAZING and very fresh!"}
{"text":"Excellent flavor and quality of food. Very nice inside even though in a mall strip. Best Thai food in Glendale/Phoenix."}
{"text":"great food... love the pad thai....awesome atmosphere..."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great customer service. Will be visiting again. Very reasonably priced. Glad I came."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here, I always get the shrimp pad Thai and it has never disappointed me, I've even ordered it to go a few times and it tastes just wonderful. Never forget to order the thai tea; is delicious, just make sure to tell them to go easy on the ice , otherwise you'll need a refill in no time, also The fried shrimp for appetizers are just delicious! I wish I could upload images but I broke my camera."}
{"text":"I love their food.  They are a tad more expensive than the other local Thai restaurant, but they are worth it.  Can you say Scallop Panang!  Their restaurant is also much nicer inside and is great for groups."}
{"text":"Good food, quick service, and big portions! Can't go wrong with their yellow curry or pad thai."}
{"text":"Consistently amazing with every dish I've had. I've been going to Siam since I was a little kid and still frequent this lovely gem!"}
{"text":"We had a delicious chicken thai with basil dish that everyone loved, my niece was practically licking the plate!  The beef noodles were okay and the fried rice was too oily for me but still good, since my sister ate the whole thing.  We really enjoyed this place.  The food came out quickly and warm and restaurant décor was dark but with a lot of cool art.  Everything they were bringing out for others looked really yummy too.  If we're back in this area again, I would try other items."}
{"text":"Great food. Service was excellent. I order d enough for leftovers on purpose. The only issue was my glass of wine tasted as though it was opened for more than a day. Suggest you ask about freshness of the bottle when ordering. I will return!"}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego and after moving here, I was searching for a decent Thai restaurant. I've tried more than 5 Thai restaurants in Arizona. My favorite is Siam! It's authentic and extremely good. It's comparable to San Diego Thai cuisine. However, I think Siam has the best Pad Thai I've ever tried! The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is very unique. My favorite restaurant in Arizona!!  Favorite dishes,  - Pad Thai - Pad See Ew - Spicy Basil Fried Rice - Fish Chu Chee (Spicy Curry with Fried Fish)"}
{"text":"My aunt introduced me to this this restaurant and I have been coming here since! My favorite dish is the Pineapple Fried Rice and the Seafood Hot Pot Combo. The Pad Thai, Chow Mein, and egg rolls are pretty good too. As for desserts, when mangos are in season, their sticky rice with mangoes are sooo delicious! The fried banana & coconut ice cream is also tasty as well. All the entrees in my opinion are pretty nice and large sharable portions. Never have I ate one whole dish by myself; I've always shared with 1 to 3 other people and its always plenty enough food for us. Siam is definitely my favorite Thai place to eat! It just makes me sad how empty this place always is... Check this place out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nice food.. the ambiance is also nice...I really enjoyed the Green,Yellow and Red curry...Been a regular visitor over here"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place to eat in the Glendale/Phoenix area so far.  This restaurant may not be located in the better part of town nor does it look like much from the outside, but do not judge a book by its cover.  Inside decorations are nice and service is consistent.  You will be served with cloth napkins, real silverware and white dishes.  I think their food is very tasty with a full assortment of flavors.  Siam Angel Wings, Pad Thai, duck curry, papaya salad and pineapple fried rice are must tries! 4.5-5 stars for their food!"}
{"text":"My dad and I went here for dinner after he helped me move as we were both craving Thai food. I yelped places in the area and this one caught my eye, it definitely didn't disappoint! We must have gotten there at just the right time because shortly after we were seating the place completely filled up! The food was delicious, the portions were huge! We had soup, pad Thai and an eggplant dish. I also ordered jasmine tea and it was so good. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now for lunch.  This is definitely my go to place for Thai in Phoenix now.  It has the best pad Thai I have had anywhere.  There is only one waitress for lunch, but she always keeps up.  Excellent service, clean nice atmosphere (inside-little unassuming strip mall outside), great food, decent prices."}
{"text":"I've been here 10-15 times and haven't been disappointed yet. I eat a lot of Thai food and it's way above average.    One night, after I expressed interest, they were nice enough to let me sample the durian ice cream. Interesting...it tasted like onion."}
{"text":"The area isn't great. The food is good and the service was quick and pleasant.  Worth a visit if you're in the area and want Thai."}
{"text":"3/14/10  Liked the ambience!   Beautiful wooden screens lined the walls; Clothed glass tables and wooden chairs.  Nice to find a place that serves tasty food and, at the same time, invests in creating a lovely space to round out the whole dining-out experience!  Had very tasty eggrolls to start, and they were some of the best I've ever had anywhere.  That is, besides my Mom's lumpia!  I believe Siam Thai's eggroll filling contain ground chicken, as well as eggs.  For my entree, I had the tofu green curry (as I use this dish to compare a new place to all of the other Thai restos I've tried thus far), and while I liked it, I found the dish too spicy (ordered medium spice) and found veggies there I had asked specifically to omit due to food allergies.  I normally send items back if they don't arrive the way I ordered, but I was hungry and I thought I'd just grin and bear through the allergy attacks as long as the dish was worthy of them.  (It's not.)  Mind you, it's tasty and spicy, but the cream sauce looked \"broken\" (I like mine silky-smooth and creamy!), and coupled with the veggies I didn't want, let's just say I'll speak up more the next time I go!  For dessert, I had the fried bananas and coconut ice cream, and oh my!  I've wanted to go back just to have this again, but alas, all my bookmarks have kept me from going back to do so :(  Soon.  So very soon..."}
{"text":"my daughter loved the silver noodle soup and my husband loved the pad thai. the fried wonton and green chicken curry was ok. service and ambience was good."}
{"text":"This is a great Authentic Thai place the decor is nice atmosphere is quite and simple but food is thoughtfully done.  Spices and flavor of the food is well done. A couple of Lao style dishes as well as this place, food is well priced as well staff is pleasant, very family friendly as well."}
{"text":"Come here often. Very sketchy strip mall but don't let that fool u about the inside and quality of this place. It's amazing! Everything is good here. Try the teriyaki beef with fried rice"}
{"text":"The food can be hit and miss, I've had their yellow curry multiple time and I loved it sometimes and other times not so much."}
{"text":"I don't know why we waited so long to try this place!  Don't let the outside fool you, like it did us for a while.  Food is amazing!  Better than any other thai restaurant we've tried, and we've tried a lot!  Pad Thai .. Spicy Fried Rice .. Hot and Spicy Fish .. Cashew chicken, Spicy Green beans with beef.  All of it - everything we've ever tried here, we've enjoyed.  We go here now at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I love this place!   Their Pad Thai, coconut soup, and pineapple fried rice, are my absolute favorites. Food portions are huge, perfect for sharing.  I frequented this place at least once a week when I lived in the are (7 years), and every time I'm in town visiting family this place is a must. I honestly have nothing but good things to say about this place. I've never been disappointed by the food quality or the service.   This is one of those \"hole in the wall\" places you do not want to pass on.   ¡Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"Located in an dilapidated strip mall in an oppresive part of Glendale you wouldn't expect much from a restaurant in the area.  Like I said the outside isn't much to look at, the building looks like it should make friends with a wrecking ball, but the inside is very inviting with nice decor and soothing music to forget about it all.    The food is a little better than average, but wouldn't say it is great in my opinion.  There are many other Thai restaurants that I have been to that fair better.  The portions come slightly less than expected for what you pay.  Service is relatively slow and don't expect your drink to be refilled right away to clear that spice out of your throat.  A server taking all the tables without any help can be a recipe for disaster.  Overall I'd say if in the area check the place out.  I'll be back, but it won't be in my normal rotation of restaurants."}
{"text":"Decided to try some Thai Food take out near my house and this was the closest with the best reviews.  When I went to pick up my food, not only was the restaurant busy but there were three of us picking up our take-out.  Always a good sign.  I got the Green Curry with seafood, hot.  Hot was hot, not \"Americanized hot\" - I love good flavored spicy food and this was it.  Some of the seafood was a bit chewey, but overall I liked it.  My roommate had the Fried Garlic with chicken, mild and his was good too.  Definitely will be going back"}
{"text":"Service 5 Food 3 Cleanliness 5 Atmosphere 4 Value 3  Pros: Friendly Staff Comfortable setting Fresh Ingredients  Cons: Pricey  Food of Asia has been the flavor of the month. I can't seem to get enough of it.... Literally no matter how much I eat I can't seem to get full. Which is exactly why this is not only tasty but in my favor for my current fitness goals. The right dishes let me pack in the good calories on cheat meals but limit the nasties.  I was ready for some more Thai food but the foodie in me had an itch to try a new place. Stray from the usual's and take a risk? We know Sala and E-San are tasty but sure why not. Food blog and yelp time! Landed here and after drooling over the menu had a mild obsession that had to be taken care of. Called up the usually eating crew and headed out.  From reading the other reviews I was already prepared to walk in the door and go unnoticed for a long period of time before I was seated. Seems someone listens because their door is now equipped with a pleasant chime that let the very busy, nice ladies, know my face was there and needed to be fed. Seems this is no longer a problem.  Very cool place in a very less then cool looking strip mall. My favorite kind of find! The whole place was done in Asian influenced stained wood panels. The obligatory Thai restaurant oversize tables/chairs were also in full effect.  The ladies took great care of us. As usual they got a laugh out of the big white guy order enough food for 10 people at a table of 3. All gone when we got up to leave, that's right! I know there are hungry people somewhere and no one will give me an address to overnight my leftovers.  I would like to give this place more then a 3 but something was flat in the food. I couldn't exactly put my finger on it but it bugged me the whole meal. Maybe it was missing some of the sweet my americanized palate had become accustomed to? I don't think that was it but something was missing from all but one of the dishes.  Duck Pineapple Curry: House specialty and I can see why. This was the best dish on the table. Something about the coconut and scalding pineapple chunks made for a great combo. Maybe the sweetness from the pineapple in this added what seemed like it was missing in other dishes. The duck was fatty but obviously rendered properly as it wasn't a vat of grease. Duck is often ruined in stews but someone knew what they were doing. Taste, smell, and texturally a happy place.  Panang Curry: My standby anywhere I go. One bite and although it was decent something was definitely missing. Not all curries are sweet(ie: massaman). I enjoy those as well but this one should have some sweet. It didn't and something else was off. First thought was skimping on the coconut. Disappointed face :/  Drunken Noodle: Fire! which I loved, but we had some gringos at the table so we specifically ordered it at a 3. If this is a 3 of 5 with a further option of thai hot I cannot fathom what Thai hot is. Whoa.. Now these were decent but someone got WAY carried away with the oil. That coats the mouth and dead goes the taste buds. So by bite 5 all I could taste was burning.  Tom Kha Gai: A very good version but not my favorite in the valley. Sala and Siam both beat this one according to my taste buds. Nothing unique or different worth nothing. Hit the craving.. no more.. no less.  Thai Toast: Oh freaking greasy awesome.. I love this stuff no matter how much I know its killing me. From the other reviews I was prepared to have to order a side of peanut sauce and pay for it. Volume wise you get your moneys worth. This was like no other that I had tasted. Much more of a goopey peanut texture and not a lot of flavors going on. Was kind of bland. What I like to call not worthy calories. What the heck was I even eating? I'm not sure. A few people said it was great so maybe an off night? or a crap we are out, open a can of xyz brand. Bleck.  Fried Banana/Coconut Ice Cream: Delicious as it is at all the places. Happy mini sugar coma :D I love coconut ANYTHING!   All this being said with all the other great Thai choices in the valley I will unlikely find myself back here. But it was a great little fling.. don't tell the others!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with Thai food. I'm very close to moving Thailand so I can bathe in Thai food. The first time I came here, the food was good but I was in bad company so I didn't enjoy it.   2nd visit. My friend and I came here and i got the sweet basil entree with beef and my friend got the sweet and sour chicken. Everything was delicious!! The sweet and sour chicken was perfectly breaded and sauced and the basil beef was the right amount of spicy and basily. My taste buds were definitely happy!"}
{"text":"What a jem! This was a fluke stop for lunch, but what a great surprise.  From the outside it's in a small strip mall, but once you walk through the doors you are transformed into a nice eating establishment. Service was spot on.  I asked for Thai spice and she warned me, \"it is very spicy\", and it was! LOVE IT!! Great portions, fast service and the best Thai I've had in a while.  And this is 2 blocks from my mom's new home. OH YES, I'll be a regular at this place."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is the worst establishment I've ever been to. I recently moved to Phoenix from Los Angeles and so I've experienced a wide array of Thai food. I am in no shape way or form a noobie to Thai food. After reading the reviews and having been matched with Siam, I decided to give it a go.  What an absolute disappointment...the first thing that came out was our papaya salad with chicken wings. I don't know if you could even call it that. The chicken was heavily battered in what looked like tempura, it was bland with no seasoning. The chicken was improperly thawed and drained of blood that it had coagulated blood. If you don't drain the blood, it doesn't look very appetizing and you'll get chunks of cooked blood around the joints making your chicken wing look black instead of white. If I wanted to eat blood, I would have gone to a Vietnamese restaurant and ordered Bun Bo Hue. The papaya salad served here were crudely cut and soggy, instead of being fresh and crispy. I felt like I was eating something that was sitting out for too long.  After deciding that both items were inedible they were pushed aside. We waited for the our main course, panang curry and pad thai. Surely they can't mess this up??! Both dishes are very popular items. I was wrong once again. First off, the wrong type of noodle was used for the Pad Thai. Instead off the rice noodle I was used to, like in all the other establishments I've been to, they used noodles the thickness of vermicelli noodles. To give a better visible, think about chicken fettuccine served with angel hair pasta instead of fettuccine noodles. To make matter worse, there was grease pooled at the bottom of our pad thai dish. A puddle of grease is not something I want to eat, where does that even come from??  That was the last straw, I couldn't mouth another fork of food. If this is the quality of food that is served everyday I don't know how long this place has even lasted. This was an extreme disappointment to the point where it makes me mad. I spent close to $50 dollars on my meal and paid over 10% sales tax.  I will never eat here ever again."}
{"text":"I was first here a couple of weeks ago on a rec from a co worker who is from Thailand that this was as good as it gets in AZ, and boy was he right.  I always try the green chicken curry hot to judge a Thai place as the baseline (kind of like at a BBQ place you need to get the pulled pork and brisket to really judge the food), and it was excellent, with a good balance of flavor, very good consistency of the sauce and very tender, yet still al dente veggies and chicken (including some excellent baby eggplant).  Everyone else that i was there with got the pad thai for lunch, and they were all very happy.  The only reason that it is not five stars is the location, as it definitely not the best, but the decor inside was very nicely appointed and was a total shock compared to the exterior."}
{"text":"I will be taking a trip to Thailand this year and was looking to try the food.  Honestly the food was amazing.  We tried the lemon grass soup, pad Thai and the Papaya salad.  All tasted fresh, veggies crunchy, all amazing!  However the service was a little abrupt. To the point where I asked my husband if it seemed that they had an issue with us.  I ordered the soup hot, being that I really enjoy spice.  I am fairly certain the waitress rolled her eyes while walking away as she seemed annoyed by me choosing hot.   I also noticed that while she assumed everyone else dining wanted rice, she mad an akward pointed question about asking if we wanted ours.  It made things really uncomfortable.  I would go back for the food, I hope the judgement in the service goes away."}
{"text":"I think this is the best thai in this area for sure. Their dinner dishes has really good taste and they make it look artistic and I like that !"}
{"text":"They were nice, the atmosphere was wonderful and it smelled amazing, but we weren't impressed with the food  we tried really hard to like it but it just didn't work. We ordered what we normally do at Thai restaurants and just didn't like it what we got. Unfortunately."}
{"text":"although the outside may look a little sketchy, the inside will pleasantly surprise you! service was good, food came out quickly, food was good, and the bill was what we expected ... how can you go wrong? def check it out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"FAB-THAI-lous or Fabulous is best way to describe the food here...Hot Panang Beef was flavorful..Unlike most Thai restaurants disguising themselves as authentic this place is the real deal. I suggest ordering mild because their hot is pretty intense, I can handle Thai spicy pretty much any place I go to but was taken back by the power of their HOT. Papaya salad w crab is outstanding as well, I wouldn't order the crab with it  again, it did nothing to enhance the meal for me. The decor & layout  is elegant, the service was fine. Since their Northern Thai restaurant I was hoping that they might have Khao soi, this was my only disappointment."}
{"text":"It's deliciousness every time I come here. I ordered the chicken satay which came with the tastiest cucumber salad. I had to order another cucumber salad it was so good. It was only $2 extra. They give you six skewers of chicken, so its more than enough for a meal. The thai iced tea is so sweet and refreshing."}
{"text":"Mediocre entrees and possibly the worst example of a Thai appetizer I've had in America. Having grown up in thailand I can be a bit picky but the yum wun send (silver noodle salad) was one of worst I've ever had. It is supposed to have sour, sweet, and spicy flavors. They were apparently trying to put us into a diabetic coma with the amount of sugar they put in that overpowered everything else through the meal. Two bites of that was enough. The pad grapow (basil pork) a Thai staple was bland and tasted mostly like boiled pork with rice, nothing like the aromatic garlic, chili, basil traditional dish it could be. On the plus side the pladug phad prig king was OK, still bland with minimal spice and undercooked green beans but compared to the rest it was amazing. Still I'd pick almost any of the other many Phoenix area Thai restaurants over this one."}
{"text":"Siam is hands down the best Thai food in the Valley. Not only is the food great but it is one of the most inexpensive places to eat. With under 50$ I have fed 3 people with Soup, a main dish, desert and Thai Iced Tea Yummy !!  I moved to Scottsdale and this is the thing I miss the most about the West side, they don't have places like this in my area :( . It is very authentic, I love that they did not change the food to appease the American palate. My very favorite is the Masumum Curry with Beef the beef is so tender it melts in your mouth. With the Coconut Soup as a starter you really can't go wrong. This place is really a must try especially if you love Thai."}
{"text":"Had a leisurely Saturday lunch with my spouse here last week.  We ordered the tom ka gai soup, a noodle dish and a curry dish--all to share, family style.  It wasn't that anything tasted bad as much as there is better for the money out there.  The soup was overloaded with onions, not chicken unfortunately.  The noodle and curry dishes tasted over-blasted with powdered pepper, while lacking a bit in other seasonings.  Portions were also smallish.  The interior looks late 90's, and the service was confused at one point, mis-delivering a thai iced tea to our table that was later retrieved rather abruptly.  No, not that bad, just not that good in my opinion."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this restaurant. Great food, good price and relaxing environment. We got seafood yellow curry hot. The heat wasn't overwhelming but I like hot food. Also papaya salad and chicken satay. The papaya salad was close to what I had in Thailand."}
{"text":"YUM. I LOVED their Thai fried rice, and Pad Thai. Incredible. Best Thai place in Phoenix by far. Kind of in a shady area, and you'd pass it if you weren't paying attention. Worth finding!!"}
{"text":"The only Thai food I've found in the valley worth eating.  Scottsdale Thai is good but I'm not spending $10 + on a dish.  I only do take-out but the hand-carved panels and atmosphere are really nice, lovely staff -- the place to go for Thai food in Phoenix. As good as the best in San Fran, Portland & Seattle."}
{"text":"Wow, I wish we had a Thai restaurant like this in the East Valley!   From the exterior and neighboring businesses, I didn't expect much from the place. I walked in and was pleasantly surprised by the friendly greeting and excellent decor.  The restaurant was half full during my lunch, and the other diners were well dressed and well behaved. Quite a nice experience so far.  I ordered my goto favorite, Pa-nang curry, and they served a large bowl and double portion of rice for a very reasonable price. The presentation was nice. The meat tasted tender and fresh. The vegetables were cooked perfectly - firm but not crunchy. I went with Medium spice and it was just right.  I live 40 miles away so I won't be coming here often, but I would almost make the drive just for this restaurant... a true diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and was very impressed.  A lot of other reviews for this place are dead on.    First of all the place is right off of 51st ave the bright yellow sign is easily visible from Northern which was a plus because I thought it might be dug deep into a strip mall.  Its actually right on the corner of one.  At first glance from the outside this may seem like a place where you would immediately say no way and back out.  But don't.  The inside of this Thai place is very well decorated and the vibe is just positive.  It is very neat on the inside.  Carved wood tables,little Buddha statues,and just overall decorated in Thai.  It is very unique compared to others I have been too.  If it wasn't for the service this would easily be a 5 star.  It is a mom and pop place which means that there is two servers who serve as waiter,busser,and hostess.   They go around the restaurant and serve the whole place not just certain areas.  It took us a while to place our order but once we did the food arrived fairly fast.  The food was awesome.  Probably some of the best Thai in Arizona if not the best.  It is all served family style which works because the portions are so huge.  We had the lemon grass soup,the basil chicken,and the red curry.  The lemon grass soup was oh so tasty.  Little hints of lemon grass followed by a smooth broth with tons of mushrooms and chicken my mouth waters thinking about it.  The basil chick by far was the best dish.  The grill taste is indescribable.  The sauce had us almost licking the bowl it was so good.  The red curry was fantastic although not as spicy as I would have liked it but still good.    Overall very  good I was impressed.  41 bucks for 3 dishes 1 beer and 1 glass of wine not too bad.  This is a great date night place.    Warning:  Hot means hot here! and I mean Arizona hot!  We got our dishes hot and I was sweating.  Which I haven't done in a long time.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has to be my favorite Thai place in town, hands down. Service here is just amazing with very kind and respected people! Inside is clean with great authentic food!! I'll sure come back soon!"}
{"text":"My first shot eating Thai, and since this place had such high ratings it seemed like a good choice. I tried the Siamese plate, the Pad See Yew and the Yellow Curry. Everything was pretty good. Some of it I liked more than others but it was nice having something different. That said, nothing I tried really made me want to come back right away. I don't think it was the food so much as just my particular interest in the type of food. Service was good and it's a nice little restaurant. If you're into Thai, check it out."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the Phoenix area!  Thom-Kah-Gai soup is awesome!  I also like the chicken saute and pineapple fried rice.  Word to the wise:  Medium is like Hot... Cuidado!  I've done both Dine in and take out and it is always bomb ."}
{"text":"Been working near here in Peoria and found this place thanks to Yelp.  The first time I came I ordered the Coconut soup Tom Kha with  veggies and tofu Thai spicy and it came out in one of those Thai metal servers with a  burner below.  Wow this stuff was so good and tasty, I could barely finish it because it was a lot of food for one, but I loved it.  I could really taste the fresh ingredients in the dish, and it was nice and spicy the way I like it.  Since then I've gotten this dish many times and love it every time. I just went again last week and thought I better broaden my horizons so I got the Panang curry and asked to have it with veggies with tofu because I gather they don't normally serve this with veggies.  Anyway they did a great job of making it the way I wanted and it was very good.  The sauce looked a little different (more brown) than what I'm used to from Panang but it tasted really good, and again they spice it appropriately for what I wanted.  It came with rice and I also asked for their tray of spices which I recommend to compliment your dish. I thought the quantity was very large and I actually had leftovers but because of travel I had could not take anything to go.  As others have said they don't have lunch specials but the prices are within reason considering the quality and quantity of food.  Also the people who own the place are very friendly and I was once able to talk with one of them about their restaurant and I was impressed how much they put into getting quality ingredients which I think is the big problem with most Thai restaurants.  Overall I'm envious that I can't get this kind quality in Cali where I live but will keep coming back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"After discovering this place 2 years ago I think it is the best restaurant in Glendale if you want Thai. Maybe even the best in greater Phoenix. The service is very fast, and all the waitresses are super nice and friendly.  However, this place can be so popular at certain times that it packs out. Sunday's are filled until 4. Sometimes lunch times can get busy too but that is because they are just so good, people make it a regular spot. Closed Monday's so save your craving for another day. The heat index is more towards the generic audience, so if you want more than hot you might have to say \"Thai hot.\" I have been here dozens and dozens of times and they have never made a dish wrong.   My girlfriend will ask to get Tom Yum. Every week! She's loves it. The Pad Thai, Pad Prik King, and the cashew entree are my super favorites. The menu is in English but everyone here is Thai so if you can't find what you're looking for you can ask for it by the Thai name if you know that already. Tip the waitresses well, they are all going to college at GCU."}
{"text":"For the freshest, most authentic Thai cuisine - look no further than Siam Thai. Modestly located in a little strip mall on the northeast corner of Northern and 51st avenue, this little gem will not disappoint.  First, the wait staff is some of warmest and friendliest, and strive to remember your preferences, from what you like to drink to your favourite table and spice level.  Soony, the chef - a native of Thailand is extremely accommodating and will make every effort to visit your table even if he  and his staff are backed up in the kitchen.  His culinary skills were honed at The Four Seasons Resort. He is most appreciative of the patrons that support him, and and is very diligent to accommodate your preferences.  From the appetizers (satay: my favourite) - the peanut sauce is made from scratch, to the nam sod salad and the entrees (the curries are brilliant), and the pad thai is not as  sweet as some American thai restaurant counterparts. The stir fry eggplant dish is wonderful as well. For dessert, you cannot go wrong with the mango and sticky rice.   This restaurant is quite a ways for me to drive (50 miles round trip), but it is well worth it considering the exquisite food, the low key atmosphere, and delightful wait staff."}
{"text":"I have since gone back 3 times for the green curry.  I'm pretty sure it's laced with cocaine to keep me coming back for more.  The spice is perfect (if you love the burn) and the staff is more than friendly.    From the outside you wouldn't think to even walk in as it's pretty close to the ghetto, but upon stepping in, you will be saying, you are not in Kansas anymore.  It's a very pretty restaurant on the inside.  The wooden screens on the wall are gorgeous and the tables are wood with runners down the center to create a very peaceful and relaxing atmosphere.    Siam Thai has become my favorite Thai restaurant hands down.  I cannot wait to take my friends and family here!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since I was 5! It is very authentic and by far the best Thai food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Peace! This is my family's first visit to Siam and WOW! we are hooked. The spring rolls are crispy and moist the pineapple curry shrimp fried rice and the Thai shrimp fried rice was deeelicious. They serve large size shrimp and one serving can can easily feed 2 to 3 people. The staff is friendly, polite and attractive. We ordered to go and they still offered us seating and cold water to drink while waited for our order, which took no time at all. A wonderful experience.. Siam has now become part of our family meal routine. thank you for caring about your customers. Bless!"}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is so good! Unfortunately there are not many vegetarian options but the lemongrass Tom yum hot pot can be made vegetarian and it was delicious. I know it was silly of me to tell them to go easy on the lemongrass. Haha.  Apparently this is my boyfriend's favorite Thai restaurant. He loves getting the hot pot and they can make it extra spicy. He also enjoys the Thai tea and desserts there. But his favorite is being able to see his car while he eats lol....literally parked right in front. And our table is right there. Haha"}
{"text":"First experience with thai food and it was an amazing one. At first sight of the restaurant (outside) I had not been impressed, once inside that changed. We were greeted and seated immediately.  We were not rushed to order, and the waitress had a great deal of patience with me as I questioned her about everything. The food was delicious, but must say the thai iced tea was my favorite thing that night. Extremely fair prices and large portions."}
{"text":"Made the journey again to enjoy what still has to be my favorite Thai food in the valley. [I look forward to someone providing a suggestion to prove me wrong.] It had been more than 6 months since my last visit and I still daydreamed of their Thai Toast appetizer. I pretty much made that my dinner and ordered the duck and pineapple curry (again) and with the exception of a few spoons worth I took it home to enjoy later. And enjoy it I did.   It's out of the way for many (since I moved downtown it is more of a journey), and located in a \"shady\" old strip mall. Don't let any of that deter you from trying it out. Many of my fellow yelpers know the \"beauty\" of a place is not always a good judge of character for the great food you can get."}
{"text":"This place definitely has their dishes down. The food tastes great and spot on with what your expectations. The interior is very traditional but it gives it a cozy feeling. The waiters/waitresses are nice and the service is great.   I usually get the Pad See Ew or Pad Kemao and have nothing to complain about in terms of taste. The deep-fried banana and coconut ice cream tastes as it should, although it is not the best I have tried.  The only downside is that I've had better food for the same price."}
{"text":"Disclaimer and Qualifications: I'm a midwestern gringo, but I've been here 20+ years, so can take a little heat.  My wife is half Thai, and her Mom and Aunts used to sit around prepping, cooking REAL ACTUAL Thai food (and gossiping) all day long, so she knows the good stuff.  The first time we went, she loved it so much that the second time we went and got a TOGO order, we brought home over $75 worth of food for her, I, and a 12 yo girl.  This doesn't mean three $25 meals, either,  since each entree/appetizer ranges from a little under to a little over $10.  Yea, leftovers!  Instructions: 1.  Hire a group of thugs to tie you up, slip a sack over your mousse-head, toss you in the back of a cargo van, and dump your pretentious, elitist butt INSIDE the front doors of Siam.  2.  Enjoy the tastiest, most authentically prepared and flavored Thai food you'll likely have this side of Bangok, served by friendly authentically prepared and flavored Thai folk, in a very clean and ornately decorated, authentically prepared and flavored environment.  3. Go through moral, ethical, and spiritual crisis as you decide whether it is time to forgoe your judgemental, plastic-coated, dream world where everything is pristine and sanitized, so that you may indulge in the tastes of the real world, not the Real World tm.  4. Decide that you simply cannot face the ugly Glendale strip mall you know is outside those doors; have thugs kidnap you back to East Valley and drop you off at Kierland Commons, so that you can wash away the filthy feeling with an overpriced gourmet coffee amongst the beautiful people.  Pretend you didn't just start down the dark path of heroin-like spicy Thai basil & peppers.  Pretend that you won't be slinking back to the other side of the tracks to cop another score sooner than you think.  Look around at all of the fronts -- on the stores, and especially the people -- they want you to believe that they are authentically prepared and flavored, but they aren't."}
{"text":"This place has the best thai food! Love the thai iced tea the silver noodles and hot n spicy noodle. My favvv. I am vegetarian and they have options to get tofu or omit the egg."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for a concert and felt like Thai. Found this place on Yelp! and decided to check it out based on the reviews and the fact that it was near the friend we were visiting at the time. The restaurant is in a strip shopping center that we never would have noticed (or found) had we not been looking for it. Oh, but what a magical dining experience! The cashew chicken was the best I'd ever had (and we eat Thai a LOT!) and the chicken satay was exceptional. Loved the veggie Pad Thai and my husband got a vegetarian (tofu) curry dish he loved. Wish this place wasn't 400 miles from my house. I'd be eating here every week!"}
{"text":"Im a big thai food snob, very picky   Out here on a trip and try this place. Tastes great, fresh and full of flavor. Portions are larger and Friendly staff.   Spice levels are accurate, and don't over power the flavor."}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood restaurant. We have been going here for years and we love the food. Massaman curry and the stir fried vegetable dish are among our favorites."}
{"text":"Great pad, delicious curry and the best sticky rice and mango. Small portions and pricey but definitely still great. The place itself was hard to find and doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside has a really nice authentic feel to it."}
{"text":"Location: 51st ave & Northern (Northeast corner)  I don't really get the \"shady vibe\" some got from this location.   Inside, the decor is exotic, welcoming and...unexpected. Being in a strip mall, I didn't expect such attention to detail.   The Food: Fantastic. But oddly, whenever we eat AT the restaurant, the food is rave-ingly good. It seems when we take it to go, we've gotten dry, unimpressive meals a few times. Not sure what that's about.  I love that they use the broccoli stalks rather than the heads. Definitely cuts the gas factor down for me.  My favorite meals: * Crispy Fried Fish ($11.95) - Non-fishy tasting catfish in an awesome coconut curry sauce...mmmm...Ironically, the fish is NOT crispy but who cares? * Just tried the Pad-See-Yew Noodles last night ($8.95) and I looooooooooooooooooooved it. The noodles were buttery tasting and the fried tofu (you can choose from tofu, beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, scallops, squid, or seafood combo) was a great firmish consistency. * Thai Egg rolls ($2.50 for 2) - Yummy but they contain chicken and now that I'm vegetarian, can't have 'em. * Fried Rice is yummy and fresh... Comes with cucumbers and tomatoes which is kind of weird but refreshing.  There's always plenty leftover for another tasty meal manana. The customer service is cordial and friendly.  The Bad: 1) Closed Mondays (weird day to close) 2) No website (in this day and age, there is no excuse for this. No one says you have to get all fancy and post the menu and stuff but even if you just put up 1 cheap page with your name, logo, address and directions...) 3) A few issues with takeout quality 4) The mounted flat screen kind of kills the ambiance."}
{"text":"The Yelpers were right again!!  Best Thai food I've had!  Had to get the Pad Thai, just to compare...one of the best (although my hubby thought it had a strange smell, he did enjoy the flavor...). I went with"}
{"text":"Siam, located in a tiny strip mall, may lack luster from the outside but serves a pretty decent dish of Thai cuisine!    While not my favorite place to go for Thai food, this place offers a pretty delicious bowl of Tom Kha and Duck with Pineapple Curry  The Tom Kha is rich and creamy and full of delicious coconut milk but could use more lemongrass.  Whenever duck is an option on the menu, I naturally order that as my choice of protein.  While the pineapple curry doesn't have too much of a pineapple kick, the subtle hints of it gave it a nice after-taste.  Siam does seem to go light-handed on spice so if you're feeling bold, get it a level higher than what you normally order!  The place is kept very clean and the servers are pretty friendly.  I wouldn't exactly drive out of my way to come here but hey:  the food is warm, filling, and flavorful!  It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"Wonderful!  Had to have them box up the leftover for fear I'd just keep eating.  The flavors just hit!!  Very comforting!  Will be a regular here. and when company comes."}
{"text":"Walking into this restaurant I have to admit it seemed a little sketchy on the outside but once we walked in it was apparent by the lovely decor and atmosphere that was not the case. The food was incredible! I had the shrimp & pineapple curry, it was delicious with just enough kick to it and wonderful flavor. I had lots of shrimp in my dish (sometimes restaurants skimp and only give you 2 pieces and call it good) so that was also pleasantly surprising. My husband had the pad thai (he ordered it as hot as he could) and definitely was impressed with the flavor and the kick as he has never eaten Thai before. Thank you for the wonderful food and service, we will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great place to get good Thai food, I had the Green Curry, it was delicious I will definitely return. This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in a tiny, sketchy-looking strip mall, but don't let that put you off. Once you get inside, it's pretty, the staff is attentive, and the food is more than great.  The fried rice is FANTASTIC. I've had fried rice at other places that comes out too greasy, or too sticky, or too undercooked, etc etc, but the fried rice here is amazing. My son loves the pad thai shrimp. My parents like most everything, but without meat because they're (mostly) vegetarian.  I love this place, so glad my mom suggested it for our Mother's Day lunch."}
{"text":"Went here with my daughter for lunch today and had a great experience! The staff was very friendly and all seemed to work together as a team.   We split the egg rolls and shrimp curry - both were wonderful. The curry dish had just the right amount of heat and was delicious.   The atmosphere is very inviting and I love the decor. The restaurant was very clean and it was nice to not have sticky menus like I find at most restaurants."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai cusine restaurant in AZ! We usually start off with Thai iced tea and some appetizers (try the chicken skewers-yum!). I love their Tom Yum Goong (you can choose between mild, medium, hot and Thai hot) as well as the green curry. Coconut ice cream is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in the area!  The food, the atmosphere and the service are always A+. I crave the yellow curry, the shrimp and their ice cream!  Servings and prices are just right too. Love the new menu, so much easier to read."}
{"text":"tom kha soup is good and they serve it hot and freshly made. the thai tea is good too although a bit sweet for my taste buds. i also tried their pineapple fried rice, definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Thai food in AZ. I'm surprised this place isn't packed from open to close. Me and my family have been coming here for over 10 years. Amazing and incredible food. Usual order is the Coconut curry shrimp soup, and the red curry chicken. Incredible flavor. SIAM FOR LIFE."}
{"text":"Always good food, good service and friendly atmosphere. My husband and I love this place. My favorite is coconuts soup and my husband's is pad-Thai. Although we don't eat it often but their appetizer, Siamese plate was also good. I can't say enough about this restaurant. Quality service and food."}
{"text":"Great serving sizes and very tasty food. I love the Pad Thai here. I can't eat MSG so I'm always looking for a convenient Thai restaurant that is nearby. I only gave it four stars because I've never sat in or have much interaction with the staff to rate customer service."}
{"text":"So tasty, great decor, and service is excellent! You have to try the garlic chicken and basil noodles or panang curry! If you can save room for desert, order the fried banana. It melts in your mouth and is served with coconut ice cream. I go to this place every couple of weeks and try to take new friends. It's so delicious and great service!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd exposure to Thai food. My first experience wasn't that great back in NC but at the urging of my friend I decided to try again. I read the reviews for this place & decided to try it out. The outside looks a little scetch but once inside it's pretty & clean.   The server encouraged me to try the red curry. My life has been forever changed!!! Every bite was every flavor perfectly fitting together. I read from one of reviews that they tend to run spicy so I went with the mild. It was just a low hint of heat that went perfectly with the creamy, savory, and slightly sweet sauce. I chose chicken to go with it.   I just can't rave enough about this place!!  A definate stop for me every time I'm in the Phoenix area."}
