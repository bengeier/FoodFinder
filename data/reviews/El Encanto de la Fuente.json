{"text":"Good service but the food was horrific. The pollo fundido was dry & no flavor.  Could not eat the tamale it was so bad. Will not go back. I had better Mexican off the neighborhood roach coach."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT service from our waiter, Adam. Fajita chicken salad was THE BEST I've ever had!   Hubby had the recommendation from Adam, which was basically a burrito with a white sauce over it....he really enjoyed it.  Inside of the restaurant was very nice and the outside covered patio was beautiful with the pond. Highly recommended this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered to-go from them this evening.  We average about once a month at this restaurant.  Always super friendly, delicious, laid back and professional.  Our dinner was outstanding, and the execution of our order, on point."}
{"text":"This is about the best of Fountain Hills that we have found.  The beer is cold.  The service is decent-although the turnover seems high.  The chips are good, the salsa ok if you mix the mild and hot together.  The outdoor patio is pleasant.  The Pollo Fondido is OUTSTANDING.  I've tried a couple of other things but I always keep coming back to this.  I think they put crack in the cheese sauce.... addictive."}
{"text":"Just so so. Service was bad - stretched staff too thin. Food was just good but not tasty enough to love it. Salsas tasted like glorified ketchup."}
{"text":"this review is based on two weekday visits, seperated by a time of six months. 
first visit, I was practically ignored by the bartender. the crowd was modest, easily could have been covered by one server or tender. my son spilled my modelo, and the bartender noticed the incident, went off to retrieve a washcloth and then never came back. I was sitting about 5 feet from the bar in the large table. I finally had to walk behind the bar and get the damn towel myself. and, she never did bring me another beer, as I requested. 
Plus: the menu for happy hour is limited, but the 3 taco sampler I got was mouthwatering. very very tasty, cooked right and appearance was 4 stars. 

second visit: enjoyed a warm welcome from the manager, seated promptly, again, happy hour menu did not dissapoint. still, the bartending staff here has their heads up their asses. too bad, as well, since they have great variety of real tequilas and decent prices for good mexican beer like Bohemia and Negra Modelo. 

the salsa variety is decent. when the weather is nice (7 months out of the year!) the patio is a great place to enjoy company who has passion for real mexican food OR a great place to bring your visiting friends and family. 
Food, atmosphere, staff 4 stars
Bartending skills, 2 stars"}
{"text":"I have been to all 3 El Encanto locations and this one is far below the others.  The chips and salsa are bland.  One of our party of 6 ordered the Tacos Fritos and asked for beans and wanted to be sure it had lettuce and tomato on it.  Ended up she was charged for a side order of beans, lettuce and tomato all seperate....one expensive taco plate, $1.99 extra just for the tomatoes.  While it probably was her mistake to order that way...it was pretty clear she wanted tacos and beans in a Mexican restaurant and it shouldn't of cost $16 to get it?   When my husband asked if a certain dish could be made spicy, the waitress said NO.  So he switched to Pollo Asado which states it is \"very spicy\" on the menu and was told it's not spicy.  He asked if it could be made spicy and the waitress said no, it couldn't be made any spicier but they could add some habaneros to it, and they did, but we were also charged $1.99 for that at the end.  When we brought it to the waitresses attention all the add on charges  (and some we let go due to miscommunication, like the beans), she argued with us and explained that's the way it's done.  She eventually sent the manager over with a menu and while he did take the lettuce, tomato, and pepper charge off ($4.97), he made a point of making sure we understood it was our fault.  We said we were surprised that lettuce and tomato on a taco would be an add on and that asking for spicy food in a Mexican restaurant would be an issue and he would of been ready to review the menu but we just let it go.  I would of liked them to charge us for a taco plate and write off all the extras but they didn't.  We had spent over $100 there and we had to argue over $5 in silly add on charges.  We were very disappointed and would never go back."}
{"text":"This place is the dirtiest, fealthiest place Ive seen.  There is an inch of grease in the
back, probably never cleaned. A chicken carcass was laying out on the floor in the back.
  I brought it to the attention of the manager \"Jesus\" and he laughed and rolled his 
eyes.  
I would never eat here again, I would be afraid of getting sick. The people that work
there dont seem to care how gross and nasty it is .
They have wild animals eating out of the trash in the back because it is a never
cleaned mess with food all over the ground.
Code enforcement will close these guys down soon, you can smell the fealth
in the surrounding neighborhood when the wind blows the wrong way."}
{"text":"We dine here often. The chips are nice and crisp and the there is a good selection of salsas. My favorite is the green salsa with avocado. I always have the pollo fundido -- it\"s excellent!! My husband had the nachos on our recent visit. They weren't on the menu, but someone at the next table had ordered them. Our waitress said that they are only served during the week, and not on weekends. She had to get manager approval ... to serve nachos ... at a Mexican restaurant ... on a Saturday night. Very odd, but the manager approved and the nachos were delicious. The patio is cozy and cute and nice on a pleasantly cool evening."}
{"text":"Attentive, friendly and efficient staff.  The chicken mole had the least flavor and spice of any mole I have had.  The mole at the supermarket has much more taste. Two of the three salsas offerred were equally nondesdript."}
{"text":"The carnitas were a delight, good flavor and presentation with warm tortillas. The service was good."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most delicious chicken & cheese enchiladas I have ever tasted in my life.

Great, timely service and nice atmosphere. My friends and I like to grab a margarita at the bar, and we've never been able to make ourselves leave without ordering food as well."}
{"text":"The southwestern ambience in this restaurant add to the experience and the food is delicious!  You should definitely sit outside when weather allows and order the pollo fundido.  They have live music at times in the bar indoors and serve three types of salsa with the light, crispy tortilla chips."}
{"text":"Pollo fundido is an amazing dish here! Shreaded chicken in a lightly fried flour tortilla topped with a creamy jalapeño sauce (not hot) and cheese. This is just decadent! A side note very much worth mentioning is the attention to the Mexican rice....it is among the best I have had. So many restaurants just throw together a mess that is just a waste of space on a plate, I feel that skimping on the sides is about as bad as a dirty restroom! Come here and eat!"}
{"text":"The one star is based on how the manager on duty tried to BS me into believing the dish I was served was the dish in the menu. I know what a stuffed chili is - that isn't what I was served. To the Manager's credit, after he determined that I was not buying his BS, he immediately asked what I wanted instead, and comp'd my portion of the bill. Overall I agree with others - the food was bland, boring, and not worth the time. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"This place is just and ordinary Mexican restaurant. Nothing special, food was decent. Their guacamole is terrible. I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food, defiantly a scratch kitchen. The decor is romantic while it feels private with a heavy South American inspiration. Bar provides exceptional mixed drinks that always arrive dressed up. The place is run very well as I have yet to see any hiccup with service during my visits. It is a place I bring family and friends to when they come from out of town, or when trying to impress a girl."}
{"text":"Had to ask for water, refills on salsa and barely had any interaction with our waiter."}
{"text":"Have been here off and on for five years quality is not reliable. The beef burro was plenty of beef but dry and Nothing else no flavor at all, beans and rice were also dry, no amount of salsa could help. This is the second time for failure on the dish and it is featured on the menu.
Not coming back!"}
{"text":"Very delicious ! Lunch with chicken spinach special, shrimp tacos and margaritas; awesome!   Loved the green queso with avocado."}
{"text":"YUM.  Hubby and I have a favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix but since we moved to Fountain Hills, we wanted something closer.  I am part Mexican, and I can tell you that this place is GOOD!  Not better than my Phoenix fave (won't say who), but it definitely will be a regular place for us.  The chips were good but I didn't care for that tasteless green stuff (salsa?).  They server got our drink order right (we are picky about that) and we had great service.  I got the taco place with all beans instead of beans and rice.  The whole plate was great!  Overall, a good authentic Mexican food restaurant BUT I would LOVE if they'd incorporate Tres Leches cake into their dessert menu!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Pollo fundito is my fav. Usually service is good. Make a great top shelf Margarita although expensive. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Great margaritas and salsa variety. Cool atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food is always excellent.  A simple order of cheese enchilada, rice and beans was worth the drive from Gilbert to Fountain Hills.  Staff is very helpful and friendly.   We'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"Blah..that's all I got...been here twice and will not be back....not sure when it became kosher to serve bland mexican food and cover it in cheese....perhaps because they are catering to the over 65 crowd in FH???

Go to senor taco...the food is authentic, the people are friendly, and you will walk out with alot more money still in your pocket."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and service! I had the fajitas with chicken and my fiancée had pollo fondido. Both excellent choices! For dessert I had fried icecream which was also amazing! Oh yeah, definitely order the organic margarita with fresh lime juice!"}
{"text":"We had a late lunch after biking. Everything was good, chips and salsa, guacamole..chips were fresh and warm. Chicken Fundido was very good, also Carnitas Tacos. I would give it 3.5 stars because waitress was a bit lacking in the greeting and personality. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Great food. Maybe best around. Unfortunately the wait  staff treat you like an inmate. At Guantanamo. I'll keep coming back for the food but I'm sneaking in water and salsa."}
{"text":"Food was delicious: Tequilla Lime Shrimp an the drink: Organic Carlos Santana Margarita..Amazing. Simply the best margarita I have ever had-Ever!"}
{"text":"Sticky and falling apart menus should have told me to leave..service was not good, at least with our waitress who could care less,,they nickle and dime you to death,even charging for the sauce they pour on top...what?? Crazy"}
{"text":"The food is good, as is the restaurant itself: the problem is the service. The man who seated us was not at all friendly, and didn't greet us at all. He just placed down the menus said 'enjoy', when we got to the table. The server was bad too. She asked if we wanted to add a bowl of guacamole. We said yes, and it never arrived. She asked if we would like a second drink. I ordered one, and it never arrived. 20 minutes later she came by and said, \"they didn't bring your drink\"? Nope, and we were all finished by then anyway. Food is good, but not so good as to put up with this service."}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow! Can't believe the negative reviews on this place! The food is literally AMAZING! I got the POLLO FUNDIDO and it was soooo delicious I ordered it again just 2 days later. 
My ONLY complaint is customer service. It is excellent but I wanted to place a TO GO order for the 2nd visit. It was a school night and I tried calling and no one picks up the phone. (This was a Wednesday!) then once someone finally picks up, he asked me to hold. He left me on hold 20 mins!!!! Never came back. So I try calling again, 14 times in a row like a crazy person. Again he picks up and puts me on hold. Another 15 mins. By this point I'm at the restaurant. I had to order there and wait 15 mins for the food to be cooked. I won't be ordering from here ever again for TO GO. Over an hour of phone tag. 
But that was just my experience with customer service. As far as the food. It's all delicious. I don't mind the wait (when I'm dining in) cause the food is hot and fresh. True Mexican at this restaurant, not tex mex
***** ANOTHER GREAT TIP***** 
All dishes come in a half serving. The FULL pollo fundidio was $11.99 and way way more than I could eat. The half size which I ordered the 1st visit was $8.99 and I was stuffed. All orders come with this option."}
{"text":"This place is different then your typical Mexican food. Yes it has the basic on the border food/ Tex-Mex. That being said it offers different option as well from fish to slow cooked pork. Now couple it with the architecture details of restaurant itself and you find your self transported to a romantic old Mexican casa!!
Careful on the habanero salsa that you can request, it has a good kick. As well with the margaritas which I find you will only need one."}
{"text":"Now THIS is a Mexican restaurant! (Not just a glorified taco and burrito making machine!) Atmosphere is sophisticated but unpretentious. Great drinks, attentive service and OUTSTANDING sensitively prepared food. I had their seafood enchiladas and the shrimp and scallops inside were clearly fresh and delicious. Had flan for dessert, which was among the best I've ever had - - light and fluffy and not too syrupy sweet. I shall return!"}
{"text":"Dropped in on a lark.  The chips and salsa were above expectation.  They had three different kinds of salsa and my only complaint is that the hottest of the three was a bit on the feeble side.  They all had good flavor, I just would have appericiated a bit more heat.

The food itself was flavorful and served hot.  All the entrée items met our expectations and the polo fundito was awesome.

Service was good.  The chips and drinks were never empty for long."}
{"text":"Great place! Our server dan was excellent and made great recommendations for what to order! We ordered the pollo fundido and the carne asada quesadilla. The cheese/sour cream sauce the pollo fundido was amazing as was the steak in the quesadilla. The margaritas were amazing as well! (highly recommend the strawberry blended one). They also had live music going until 9 o clock. A+ all around if you ask me!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp dinner.   5 nice sized shrimp, cooked and frozen in Indonesia and warmed up in Fountain Hills.  They tasted like water
The grilled vegetables were an overcooked mix of onions, green peppers and 3 slices of squash.

My wife had the  $12.99  Pollo Asado Con Salsa, a Small piece of a chicken breast with grilled vegetables.  Vegetables consisted of fried onions, green peppers and a couple slices of squash, all over cooked.  The vegetables were a substitution for rice and beans, the 1/4 cup of mushy vegetables didn't measure up.

NEVER AGAIN!
If you want Mexican food in Fountain Hills, this isn't it.  There are other Mexican restaurants in Fountain Hills that are far better.

 
VERY VERY disappointing,

 Filbertos drive thru puts them to shame.
NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! Too pricy for my liking but its good food. They used to charge for the second thing of chips and salsa. I love me some chips and salsa so that was a bummer."}
{"text":"We have spent lots of dinners at this restaurant.  They have good food and a good set up.  Unfortunately, they charge you extra for everything.....chips, salsa, sauces, etc."}
{"text":"Excellent meals.  Great drinks.  Matilda a gracious host.  She made our meal special.  We enjoyed our first visit to El Encanto."}
{"text":"I'm probably not the best person to write a review for Mexican food, because I'm just not the biggest fan. Didn't grow up with it, so I don't crave it the way other people do. I've been to places that people tell me \"are the best\" and to me, they taste pretty much the same as every other place I've tried. What I do LOVE about El Encanto is the atmosphere and service. I've dined inside on a cold winter's night - and enjoyed the fireplace and live guitarist. And I've dined when it's warm, outside in the walled patio by the little pond. The service is always attentive and knowledgeable. I've taken people who say they know good Mexican food and they've said the food is delicious. And everything I've had has been good. Personally my favorite are the chips and salsas served free. The chips are always hot and fresh and the three salsas are super fresh and oh-so-good! I'm just not the right reviewer for the rest of it"}
{"text":"We are longtime, regular customers at El Encanto and have enjoyed every meal there until recently. Something strange is going on at El Encanto, and we wonder whether it is under new ownership or management.  The last two times we've been there, I ordered a favorite - plata de chile verde. Both times the sauce, which had previously been rich and flavorful, was basically water and the pork was barely seasoned.  My husband ordered chicken fajitas, and the chicken was tough & stringy, with strange areas of cartilage-like substance. El Encanto's chicken fajitas used to be made with delicious, high quality chicken breast.  No more.

There were odd little omissions, like the usual side of lettuce & tomatoes left off the plato de chile verde.  The small green salad, which is normally ample, was tiny -- no more than half the previous size.

We didn't recognize even one of the wait staff, and a nervous gentleman whom we took to be the manager roamed the restaurant the entire time we were there, looking worried & dour. Is El Encanto under new management?  If so, they need to have a chat with the previous managers and return to the quality & standards that have made this restaurant such a popular success."}
{"text":"Food was good, however the service was terrible. The hostess was nice but it took forever to get our food and the manager was rude.  Asked for dressing for the fajita salad and the manager questioned my decision about dressing on the fajita salad.  He brought out dressing for my in laws ensilada and purposely never brought my dressing.  Would probably not go back because of the rude service."}
{"text":"We were house hunting in Fountain Hills (moving there from rainy Oregon) and after a long day in the hot car we stumbled upon this place.  We asked to sit outside (nice ambiance, trees through the roof) as it was just about dusk.  They offered us to sit where there were misters but we wanted to enjoy the warm evening.  We ordered two different kinds margaritas (each). Both were excellent. The chips were hot, three kinds of salsa.  Our waiter was busy but not so much that he didn't take time to make us feel welcome.  Service wise, he was totally on top of his game. The manager also came by to introduce himself and welcome us. When we told him it was our first trip to El Encanto he said that we get free desert. We were stuffed so we didn't have any, but it was a very kind gesture.  Overall we had a great dining experience. Can't wait to make a return trip."}
{"text":"Mediocre, disappointed. Live music was too loud in that small space, couldn't speak to each other! Charged too much - charged for wine that we didn't get, after discussion it was removed from the bill...expensive extras like sour cream $1.50 guacamole. Not attentive staff. Too many kids working, they congregated at the post next to the door. Overall, overpriced."}
{"text":"My wife is a Mexican dining snob who loved the food at El Encanto de la Fuente. We had outstanding house Margarita's to start off the night. I must say the chips and salsa was great! I couldn't stop nibbling on them. Our waitress, Alysha, did an outstanding job of explaining the dinner specials and was extremely attentive to our table of six. 

Each of our party of six ordered something different and everyone rant and raved about how good it was. I had the salmon and shrimp dinner. The fish was cooked perfect...."}
{"text":"Seriously...the best tasting Mexican food in Fountain Hills!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and enjoyed our meals.
The chile relleno and enchiladas were both very good.
They have a nice outdoor patio area that is walled off from the parking lot.
Service was good and they had a decent crowd for lunch that day.

El Encanto and Sofritas are the best two Mexican/tacos/tapas spots in Fountain Hills.
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love the decoration and the ambiance.
We had lunch there with colleague and I ordered Pollo Fundido. It's very delicious!  Chicken breast rolled in a tortilla and covered with hot melted cheese sauce.  My colleague had Enchilada,  Fajitas, Tacos. All looked great. One of my best Mexican food experience!

Price: Great
Food: Great
Ambiance: Great
Service: Good"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Tex mex restaurants I've ever ate at all. Everything was fresh and the chips and fresh chips keeps coming. The strawberry margarita had a lot of tequila in it. Would go back again."}
{"text":"we have been here twice since we wanted to give it a chance, we love the same restaurant in cave creek... Sorry to say this is a 2 time looser! The food is horrible and I mean horrible. I had fish tacos that were a joke.. tell me somebody where you hid the fish?? the flavor was not there and the carne asada my husband had was cooked like shoe leather even after he asked for it medium. There was no flavor at all and the side of rice was old and dried out. The black beans I had were so salty I only needed one bite to tell me these were heading to the garbage. It is worth the drive to cave creek to enjoy the atmosphere, delicious food, drinks and wait staff that made this restaurant popular \"the original El Encanto!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was pretty poor. If I tell you I'm cold and give you the option to close the door or move to a different table....don't pretend to close the sir, but then open it back up two minutes later. This happened twice. Annoying."}
{"text":"After being so impressed with the Cave Creek location, we decided to try the Fountain Hills spot as well.

I have to say I was pretty disappointed... I decided to venture away from my old standby (chile relleno) & try something new. I had the Pollo Asado con Salsa Autentica, which sounded mouth-watering on the menu. I got what appeared to be a boiled, rubbery chicken breast covered in salsa. It was supposed to come with black beans & rice, but there was no rice & the beans tasted like they were straight from a can. Yuck.

The chips & salsa were good, and almost exactly the same as the Cave Creek's location. 

My mango margarita was delicious, but had barely ANY alcohol in it.

The only saving grace was our server, who was attentive, personable & quite funny! Unfortunately, we never got her name... (A noteworthy detail: the manager on the lunch shift Wed 4/25 was the LEAST involved manager I've ever seen in a restaurant! She passed us several times during our hour+ there & didn't even acknowledge our presence.)

Granted, we were there for an early lunch, but after having read the mission statement on the back of the menu, I would have to say it was a let-down compared to the Cave Creek location.

When my husband & I move to Phoenix next year, we will be making the drive to the Cave Creek location when we want excellent Mexican food & an enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"Yum. The green salsa is deelish. Beef tacos are yummy and the jalepeno relleno is fantastic. I'll be back."}
{"text":"If you want to go to a restaurant that has Mexican food that is out of the ordinary, but extremely good come to El Encanto. I love to come here with my family! They have a great outdoor seating area when the weather is nice during Winter months."}
{"text":"The dish called Pollo Fundido might be one of the best Mexican meals I have had in a long time. In this lunch size version for $7.99, you get a good sized semi-crisp burrito (only heated in the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese on top) and it was filled with tons of glorious roasted white meat chicken, onions, peppers and spices. Served with a side of very authentic Mexican rice, the key to this dish was the mild Jalapeno Cream Cheese sauce that usually comes on top, but can be ordered on the side. This sauce is addictive and I say get it on the side so you can dip the chips and everything else into the cheesy mixture. Truly a great meshing of ingredients. Friend got a large carnitas burrito with rice for $7.99 and she had no complaints and lots of leftovers. They start you out with three salsas and free chips and since I'm more of a mild dude, I focused on the green, which was full of great flavor. None of the sauces were chunky style, but the medium also was good with a nice bite. Everything was quite tasty and they give you a pitcher of water which was nice because this was the 4th hottest day in Phoenix history. Also, even though the lunch specials are limited (chicken sandwich?), you can still get smaller portions of the dinner menu, but those choices are all over ten bucks. Go for the Fundido."}
{"text":"I used to like this restaurant however I won't go back.  I took my mom for Mothers Day lunch.  The outside eating area where we sat was crawling with flys.  They were everywhere and we spent the entire lunch shooing them off our food.  I mentioned this to both our server and the manager who both basically blew me off saying there was nothing they could do about them because they were located on a wash.  I thought the whole restaurant was dirty, including our salsa plates and silverware.  The quality of the food has gone down hill significantly and this along with the \"who cares\" attitude has ruined it for me."}
{"text":"This restaurant has no idea what they are doing. We came here for dinner at 6:10 PM and they said they could not seat us because of reservations at 6 and it was a 1 hour wait. Ironically, they had 3 empty tables. What restaurant lets customers walk away when the claimed reservations have not showed up. They need to learn how to run a restaurant. I'm tired of poorly managed restaurants. The owners should go to NYC or LA to learn how to do things! Don't come here!!"}
{"text":"Wow. This was the craziest, worst dining experience I've had, and I consider myself pretty low maintenance. I feel bad for half the staff, who were good, especially the cooks as the food was excellent. I hope the owner reads this, because I would be embarrassed by what happened. 
   So they were kind of busy, but they obviously had staffing issues as the waitress admitted this. It took 15+ mins to get served (as in anyone to come to our table) after being seated. Our dinner came out before our drinks. We had to ask for plates/silverware, in fact, one of us had to go grab plates ourselves. The temp/assistant manager (who according to one waitress had one week left) got pissed because my dad asked \"what's going on tonight?\" and the manager responded with, \"you can't talk to me that way.\" 
   Our waitress was terrible, hardly came by, didn't have any empathy or ownership. On our way out it only got worse, my dad and the manager got into it with the manager telling us we are rude... meanwhile customers who were waiting to be seated decided to walk out. 
   On the bright side, our Uber driver was excellent!"}
{"text":"Two different fountain hills professionals recommended this place to us. Please understand I was raised on Mexican food so this may seem harsh. 

First the chips and salsa. Chips nice and warm and perfectly fine. The salsas not so much. The mild is reminiscent of generic tomato paste. The hot is the same as the mild but a little spice added.  The tomatillo I don't even know what to say. It was green.  We ordered a side of guacamole and it was not what we were expecting. It was just mashed avocados. No seasoning. Not traditional.  

The main dishes. 

I had the pollo fundido everyone raves about. First, I'm not even sure it qualifies as \"Mexican\" food, but that's beside the point.  From what I gather, this dish is grilled chicken breast wrapped in a tortilla and deep fried a la chimichanga style topped with the fundido sauce and shredded cheddar cheese. The \"fundido\" sauce (cream cheese and jalapeños) was very rich, creamy, and flavorful. It was quite good.  The cheddar cheese they might as well have just skipped it due to how little cheddar cheese was on it.  The biggest problem I had with this dish however, was the chicken itself. To say it was \"dry\" would be an understatement. It was super dry. Tough. And stringy. The side of rice was ok but nothing worth writing about. 

The other entrée we had was the cheese enchiladas in red chile sauce. Not much to write about here either. Canned red enchilada sauce over melted cheese in a tortilla, rice as in the other dish, and beans.  

The service and atmosphere were outstanding and the only reason I give 3 stars.  The service was 4+ star. The prices for what we got?  Not. 

I'll definitely try again and hope for better results.

Edits:  see pics. 

Jalapeño rellenos?  There was no chicken and really nothing worth mentioning. I won't order this again and that is a disappointment to me because I love jalapeño poppers, rellenos (if you want to call them that), etc. 

The \"tacos\" I had were of the carne asada variety. Two things:  I've never had carne asada tacos with cabbage. And I've never been served a dish in restaurant wrapped in aluminum foil.  

That \"sopapilla\" I won't even discuss. It should be removed from the menu. Oh. Wait. I don't think it's on the menu.

Lastly, one of our party asked for gluten free options and was told they didn't have any. So. Just be aware of that."}
{"text":"Delicious food and and great service. Love the chips bean dip appetizer. Great drinks and you must try the flan!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night, environment was really odd. I've been to the other locations which were busy and a lot going on, but this one was awkwardly quiet and boring. Even the waitress was super quiet. Food was good, but I'd rather visit the larger locations for a better ambiance"}
{"text":"Great local Mexican restaurant. Delicious good. This Encanto is a little smaller than the main one in Cave Creek, but they did a great job providing a unique atmosphere with their beautiful patio/courtyard. 

GET THE POLLO FUNDIDO. My wife gets craving for that dish! That with some roasted vegetables was enough for us to share. 

Highly recommend this locally owned gem of a Mexican food experience!"}
{"text":"Everything I could ask for in a Mexican restaurant. Amazing margaritas (not too sweet), tamales were delicious, and the fish tacos were some of the best I've ever had- and I've had a lot of fish tacos. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food and my family enjoys the atmosphere 
I have lived in fountain hills for 16 years and this is by far the best Mexican food in the area 
The staff is very friendly also"}
{"text":"Not for the calorie counter. Get the sampler plate and try all three salsas; they're all spectacular.  Also be sure to sit on the patio; very pretty out there.  Service was good, margaritas were eh, but that's fine.  And yes, the Chicken Fundido is to die for.  Amazing.  The sauce was spectacular to the point we found ourselves digging for chips just to scrape every last bit of sauce off the plate.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Please note that this is the El Encanto in Fountain Hills Arizona, not the one in Cave Creek. The ambiance is fantastic, artwork beautiful on the walls, only outshined by the excellent service and food. I've taken people to El Encanto from out of town, even from Santa Fe, where people think they know everything about Mexican food. Everyone agrees el Encanto is one of the best they've ever had if not the best. I usually order whatever special they are offering and have never been disappointed. My favorite is anything with Vera Cruz sauce on it, the regular house Margarita is a knockout, and the Pollo Fundido and Queso Guillermo are musts. Either on the covered and heated patio or inside the main dining room, this quaint, authentic, relaxing, true Mexican restaurant is certainly the best place in Fountain Hills for dinner.  Sometimes there is a wait, but that is usually only on weekends during the dinner hours. We get there either around 5, or after 8:30, and never have a problem getting a seat."}
{"text":"I have been coming  to El Encanto since they opened in FH. And the attitude I got from the female mgr tonight was... well unbelievably bad..... I ordered the Pork Shank special... and it was not good.  It was a leg of pork, under cooked (not the fall of  the bone I expected or was told...cause if was cooked all afternoon....) the black beans were not cooked completely as well..... and we ordered two of the pork shank specials....now .. that  being case... what blew me away was that I did not get an apology or I am sorry this happened from the  mgr....Andy is our favorite waiter and always our first choice when we dine at El Encanto and his service is always first rate..... but what is wrong here..... another new mgr who doesn't  get it.... its all about making a customer happy.... if this was my first time... I probably would never return.....she should be fired.... what is she is doing in the F and B business? and a manager as well.... very disappointing ..... and not even a reduction in my bill  one drink or one dollar... not that I expected it but it seems like a little empathy or something, ... and  so it goes..... another nice restaurant managers who don't understand what the service industry is all about......."}
{"text":"Definitely a better than average Mexican restaurant
Lovely outside sitting area with a garden patio  My wife and I both had the chicken mole dish.  Service was slow but that was OK as we were visiting with friends. We will definitely return to this restaurant.
Well I finally tried the cheeseburger. For a Happy Hour price of $6.00 it was OK - but I won't repeat that item. For $2.00 more the sweet potato fries were excellent. They also have a nice glass of Zin for $10.00 a glass   Still a fun place to meet and have a glass and a bite"}
{"text":"The food is just average Mexican food. Really expensive and the manager looks like he is not happy to be there. 
Won't be back."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Got the fajitas. They were pretty bland. We got the fried ice cream for desert. It was either not fried or not fried this century. It was rock solid and was almost impossible to eat. All in all
I would not return here."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came here on our day trip to Fountain Hills after reading reviews on Yelp. I am rating this place a 5 because of their extraordinary guacamole, pollo fundido, and green corn tamale. We ordered the sampler plate.  It was the perfect size for a couple to split for lunch and gives you a taste of everything.

Their chips were really good - no grease or stale taste. The salsa came with three types: spicy, regular, and green. The green one tasted really fresh. The regular reminded me of a half italian/half mexican sauce - it was very addicting and unique. The spicy was fun because it wasn't too spicy and had texture to it. 

The food is great portion. The fundido is packed full of chicken with an amazing sauce. The tamales were moist and packed full. The guacamole was fresh and had great flavor. My fiance really liked the black beans. The one thing we didn't really eat were the fried jalapenos. 

We plan on coming back and bringing friends. I know I will have cravings for that green corn tamale."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food at reasonable prices.  Had an afternoon snack of Baked Chili Rellenos.  Chips and three salsas was served promptly soon after seating.  Excellent service.  The Rellenos were spicy and filling.  Servers were pleasant and at tentative!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Pollo fundido is fantastic. Chips and salsa free with your meal. Fantastic service. Beautiful outdoor patio. Definitely will return. Nice servers and very attentive."}
{"text":"My husband and I were out in Fountain Hills for the first time and we found this restaurant on yelp.  We had no idea what to expect and were extremely surprised by how delicious our meal was! The pollo fondido was out of this world!
A true neighborhood gem!!"}
{"text":"Came here because I love the El Encanto in Cave Creek. I was looking for a closer option but, next time I will be making the extra drive to go to the Cave Creek location. This location was not bad but fell short on overall atmosphere and food quality compared to the Cave Creek location."}
{"text":"Awesome salsa. Awesome margaritas. Awesome Mole. Highly recommend!! Everyone should go out of their way to eat here - I always do! I can't get enough! You will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"My go to Mexican food in fountain hills. The food here is quite good. My favorites are the queso dish and fish tacos. Soooo good. I love the atmosphere here. It is cozy, homey and warm. The patio is romantic and cute, a perfect place to sit when the weather is nice and cool. Ooh, I almost forgot, the margarita here is the bomb. It is strong and refreshing."}
{"text":"If you like faux mexican food served on plates that would melt lava than this is the place. went for dinner got the taco plate with rice and beans. when we got our food the beans where screaming for me to give them water so i poured a half glass of water on my plate. the water started to boil as the poor beans soaked up the rest. we stated our complaint and only a redo was offered so we left without burning our insides out. rolaids anyone? So we then went to senor taco which was waaay better. Senor Taco, best mexican in FH lol."}
{"text":"About as good as your gonna get in Ft. Hills for Mexican food. Try the Roasted Jalapeño Rellenos!"}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were great.  Fish tacos were great as well. The Outside patio has a nice ambience.  Excellent meal all around."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, tasty food & delicious margaritas.

Try the chocolate tamale for dessert. Cute spin on a Mexican classic."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place and after living 11 years in Az I have tried many Mexican restaurants.  Love the patio and the relaxing vibe (especially on Sundays) and the pollo fundido sauce.
Have introduced friends to the Fountain Hills location and they are hooked too!"}
{"text":"When we arrived the restaurant was busy, but we didn't have long to wait for a table. Our server was friendly and quickly brought over water, chips and dip. We had the special, seafood burritto,......absolutely delicious, really liked the green sauce. Had the house margarita......also very good. We enjoyed our meal and will go back."}
{"text":"Wednesday before Thanksgiving - packed. At first I thought it was going to be difficult as the waiter (server? - I gotta get the PC verbiage right) seemed a little high-strung. However, as the meal progressed he definitely became much more personable.

I like the simplicity of the menu and the simplicity of the preparations. I had the fish tacos - it was a little strange that the two tacos came in separate tin foil packages on the plate....did they steam them that way, or simply prepare them and then put them in there to keep them warm? A tad disconcerting. However, they were good - the fish was flavorful - I just would have liked a little more of whatever was on the fish inside the tacos-was it sauce? Was it avocado? Was it sour cream or crema? No idea, but just a smidge more would have been good. The rice that came with it was so good I actually ate it....which I normally don't do with \"regular\" mexican rice. Had a smidge of a sweetness to counterbalance the savory.  It also came with black beans. I confess I didn't try them because I was full. The portions are not huge - which I find to be a good thing - they're just right.

The chips are light.....not all that flavorful but fine. They are accompanied by 3 different salsas which are also fine. We ordered guacamole and it could have used a bit more flavor as well.

The desserts are absolutely worth ordering. The fried cinnamon ice cream is the clear winner. Seriously - corn flakes on the outside forming the nice, warm crunch through to the cold cinnamon inside was amazing. The flan was good. The chocolate tamale with mint chocolate chip ice cream was good for a choco-holic but if you're not that, go with the fried ice cream.

I'll come back when I'm in town with the folks again if they want Mexican food...."}
{"text":"Just like the other 2 locations this place rocks! Best MEXICAN in Az!!! Love the pollo fundido and omg the chicken mole is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Beat Mexican food in Arizona by far! I love their atmosphere and chips and salsa too! I am a forever customer. I've been coming here for years and will continue!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh,delicious and amazing. The staff is friendly, courteous and attentive. Best Mexican Food in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"100 chips and salsa later ( my fav 3 salsas), I still managed to finish the chicken enchilada. Good amount of shredded chicken, sauce, cheese. Comes with rice and beans. Like most other places, just good. I like that they have lunch portions. Good service too. A small bar if that's what you have in mind."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch on a work trip. I got the seafood enchilada special with black beans and rice. It was very tasty. Exceeded expectations!"}
{"text":"When we are in the area of Fountain Hills, we Always eat here. They have gluten free red sauce enchiladas, I love them.  We have been to the other location as well in Cave Creek. The food here is so good and many things to choose from that is gluten free.  We have never had bad service here. Chips are nice and thin and three different sauces are really tasty.  They have outside seating and when its in the cooler days, they have space heaters all over. I especially liked it outside because there is a chef out there preparing all kinds of things on the grill. You know that smell, it just pulls you in. That's pretty smart selling point, lol
I recommend trying one of El Encanto locations, the food is Delicioso!"}
{"text":"It wasn't as good as the OG. 
Service was prompt and friendly, interior clean and well decorated. 
Food was served hot and in a timely manner and the margaritas didn't disappoint. 
There was just something missing... Maybe they should get a couple ducks ;-)"}
{"text":"Patio is absolutely relaxing homey feeling  , food is delicious and services is excellent , pls I recommend this place anytime for good experience ."}
{"text":"I can't get myself to order anything but the pollo fundido. The jalapeno cream sauce is rich delicious and the chicken is tender and flavorful. They also do a great sangria. They serve you three different salsas and have very good tortilla chips.  Eat outside its relaxing and charming."}
{"text":"So, I have been coming here on and off throughout the last 2 Years. The food hasn't changed but this is not my reasoning for leaving this Yelp with only 1 Star. 

They have the atmosphere of a great Mexican style restaurant, however the cleanliness of their utensils and drink-ware are always a problem. I gave this place a rest for a couple months HOPING that things would change. 

However, to my dismay I came back with my buddy for lunch ordered a cheese quesadilla with rice and beans. My buddy had to ask the waitress for a whole new utensil placement cause there was caked on food, she sarcastically said \"oh someone already ate on it\" 

Thinking that was the end of the dirty dishes I started eating my food when it arrived I took a couple of sips of my soda and as it got a little lower I noticed something on the cup, taking a quick glance thinking it was from the salsa on the outside. But as I picked up the cup the caked on food was on the inside. How do I know this was not mine was clear as I have been using a straw the whole time. 

That was it I didn't eat anything anymore or drink anything. So this is why the 1 Star.

So to the owner/manager, please advise your dishwashing crew to first rinse off all food before placing it in the dishwasher. And second to whomever your waitstaff is, please have them observe the utensils that they are wrapping to ensure that the dishwashing crew are doing their job. 

It's a team thing not just one person. I did my part by informing our waitstaff however this should never be an ongoing issue.

I will not be returning to this establishment sadly, however to whom ever goes there please be observant in the overall experience of your dining.

Thank you"}
{"text":"The salsa and chips are fantastic!  The server was nice but a little forgetful.  She got my order wrong, but the food was good and we'll try again at their other location."}
{"text":"We really loved our time and dinner at El Encanto. The food is fresh and has a southwestern flair. Staff was informative. The outdoor area was an awesome environment."}
{"text":"Pretty bad. Food came out room temp to cool and tasteless. Worst Mexican food I have ever had."}
{"text":"This place is a great go to. It has a unique atmosphere - ask for a spot outside to enjoy the babbling fountain on the patio! Live music on a Saturday night just adds to the great vibes. 

Friendly service every time we have been. We are out of towners who often visit family nearby, and we have to come here at least once every trip! 

Listen, the food is always good. It's exactly that - GOOD. It's not overly creative, it's not a flavor explosion, but it's consistently good and full of classic flavors and that is what keeps us coming back. Go for the relleno con pollo or fajitas to get plenty of food. The fundido sauce is super tasty- ask for some with whatever you get! The guacamole is a perfect starter, and wait staff does a superb job at keeping that chip basket full. Margaritas are tasty but on the sweet side. Grab a pitcher for good value. 

If you're unsure, definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant today for lunch.  We all had excellent meals. I had the special which was the best chicken I have ever had.  It had a spinach queso sauce that made the whole dish.  Andy was our waiter & as always is the best!"}
{"text":"Portion sizes are amazing! I just wish I had more salsa for my chips :("}
{"text":"Rude server Gabrielle, rude manager....we live in FH and have been going here for 2 yrs. but won't be back!! We took family tonight who were new to FH and it was a disaster...We politely told server that my husbands dinner was ice cold and she rolled her eyes and walked away. She then came back...literally tossed the check on the table and walked away without a word. And there was literally  a 22 minute span with no server...We told the manager what happened and he didn't say a single word in response and handed us our receipt. Neither my family nor my friends nor my multiple local FH clubs will be back to this place. Probably for best since we always get food poisoning the day after we eat there anyway and the whole area around the restaurant smells really bad like rotten meat. No worries though ...we hear Mucha Lucha in FH is awesome and they now serve alcohol so bye bye El Encanto!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food  and margaritas. The Yelp reviews were deceiving. We had a fantastic experience! 

Update: So good we already came back 3 nights later!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff!  What a nice addition to Fountain Hills!  Pollo Fundido is wonderful!  Margaritas are spectacular!"}
{"text":"Love it....Love it.....Love it!!!!   This is by far, our favorite Mexican restaurant of all time!   Everything on the menu is predictably delish.  Their three salsa starter is the absolute bomb!!!! And I have never had a better house margarita ever!!!! On the rocks always and never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fairly good food, strangely bad service.  Anything in a glass was a mess; two pitchers of water had dirt in them, drink orders were took four trips to get almost right.  We gave up at that point.  Food was tasty, but special instructions were ignored.  How hard is it to leave off the pico de gallo garnish?  Wait staff is supposed to remember orders, not write them down.  Not a good idea."}
{"text":"Wow. Drive by on the highway craving Mexican food and this randomly comes up on the radar. A quick 6 min detour well worth the effort. 
Cool outside seating on a shady patio with waterfall. 
Fish tacos was incredible. Some kind of firm flesh line fish grilled to perfection in perfect corn tortillas."}
{"text":"Cute place with nice outdoor patio. Food was pretty good. Service kind of slow. Good enough to go again, but nothing fabulous."}
{"text":"El Encanto is a wonderful place to eat in Fountain Hills! My family and I go here regularly. Their margaritas are fantastic and the guacamole is so good. Prices are reasonable (not the cheapest but not super expensive). I recommend the Ensalada Fresca with shrimp. 

On Friday nights they often have a live guitar player who only improves the already great vibe."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! And, best of all, it's in my own town of F.Hills!

Tried the recommended Pollo Fundido and was not let down. They used a very generous amount of chicken and was nicely made. Chicken was stringy and moist - perfectly done!

Had 2 House (frozen) margaritas - sooo delicious! NOTE: I had a HORRIBLE hangover on Sunday from 2, yes 2, margs. Not to be snotty (well, I am a liquor snob, I guess), but they use Sauza tequila in their mix. No bueno. I had such a horrid headache that felt like I had 8 drinks.

In the warmer months, enjoy patio seating in the back w/their relaxing fountain! Love that they have so much greenery around their patio."}
{"text":"Why the wide range of reviews? Because, for the most part, the food is pretty good and, for the most part, the during-dinner part of the service is pretty good. But, far too often, they make major service errors. Our experience sums it up. 
As others say, the salsa that is your first food impression is weak. Several food items were excellent (e.g. Plato de carnitas). 
Now the screw-up. We arrived as a group of 8 and asked for the patio, but we're told \" no tables available on the patio\". One of us had wandered out and saw lots of free tables. New answer:\"that section is closed\". So first, don't lie to customers. Second, a group of 8 -- accommodate them."}
{"text":"They messed up the order pretty good but were very quick to fix it. I was impressed and the pollo fundito is the bomb diggitaahhhhhhhhh!!!!!"}
{"text":"By far probably the best restaurant house margarita I've ever had.  The flavor is awesome and packs a punch.  They definitely don't skimp on cheap ingredients.    The food is very good as well.  Have tried several different menu items and have not been disappointed at all.   Service is good and wait staff is very friendly.  My only complaint is they should keep my tortilla basket refilled without asking especially if I order a chip related appetizer.  I would recommend this place without any hesitation."}
{"text":"I have always really enjoyed this restaurant. Three different Salsa's with fresh chips are brought out before you order. Everything tastes as if it is made from scratch. The service has always been great and the prices are good value. I've been to nearly every restaurant in Fountain Hills and this is the one I'm sticking with whenever I'm in that area."}
{"text":"Again, El Encanto does not disappoint in any way. It's hard to conceive Mexican cuisine as being gourmet, but this is just about as close to it as one can get without going to Las Vegas or San Diego. My wife had a chicken piccata dish that oozed with flavor and fresh tenderness; I stuck with my favorite chili verde offering. 

The superb wait staff is not hesitant to recommend house favorites.  Our waitress had something many Mexican establishment servers lack: panache. She called our attention to the local sites and shopping venues."}
{"text":"We tried calling to make reservations this past Saturday, there were no greetings and the mailbox was full. So we got in the car and drove down there to find the place was all locked up at 6:00 PM. Didn't see any notices posted. 
We were saddened."}
{"text":"Took a company of about 7 here and we were all impressed. The decor was great and the food here was amazing. I have to say - I've never had better Mexican-styled rice. We had a little bit of trouble getting out on time because there was a delay in ordering and getting checks BUT I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"It was ok. Shrimp tacos were fried too hard and chewy. Tough to eat. Food was just overall marginal. Veracruz shrimp was tasty but a tad overcooked. Beans soupy."}
{"text":"Super!
We've been a few times and I keep forgetting to review. The location is easy to find on Saguaro from Fountain Hills or off of Shea.
Their salsa are fabulous - I'm gonna guess homemade because I swear it had a little kick to it today that I don't remember. 
My favorite dish us the Chicken Fondido  (or something like that). It comes in 2 sizes, the small portion us perfectly sized. I. Love. This. Dish!
Today the hubs had Chile Relleno con Pollo - he said he thoroughly enjoyed it.
The wait staff is always polite and attentive. Indoor and patio seating available. Bar and the have a TV behind the bar, Cuz sometimes you want to get away for a Dos XX'S and the game!
We love this place! Will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Waited over 20 minutes and the manager seated two parties ahead of me. When I questioned him, there was no response. I had to inquire with him again before he said 2 people didn't come to work. Really?

The Pescador meal was delivered without my tortilla. Never came back to inquire if everything was satisfactory.

Nice ambiance on the patio with a water feature. 

Service and management a big fat zero."}
{"text":"The salsa is excellent, so were the Carne Asada tacos. However, the taquitos were dry and very little meat. Service was very, very slow. It took 45 minutes to get tacos Ala carte, and an order of taquitos. The beans were ice cold. Nobody checked back on us to see if we needed anything, or to refill or water. 

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Glad we didn't read reviews before visiting. We found the food very good (fish tacos and chili relleno) and margarita was also very good.  I am a yankee/scandanavian with no stomach for anything over 1 jalapeno - however, I found their *hot* salsa very pleasant...can see how someone with a real palate for the stuff would think this was blah.  Service was great and the patio is awesome. The flies are there, though and we had a couple that were quite pesky once we got our food.  We are local and will be back."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in the Valley and was so happy when they opened in Fountain Hills. We used to have to drive to Cave Creek to the original one. Have met our Scottsdale HomeStore's real estate clients here many times and all have enjoyed the service, the food, drinks and ambiance. My favorites are Pollo Fundido, the stuffed jalapeños and the Organic Margarita."}
{"text":"Same menu as their other location in Cave Creek (and presumably the others). Food is good basic Mexican fare.  Service was poor., despite the place not being all that busy.  We were there early on a weekday, so no idea how they handle a big weekend crowd. Waitress apologized for the delays, and blamed the bartender for our second round of drnks being long delayed, with one order missing.  Men's bathroom was in dire need of cleaning.  I likely will not go back.  Might go to Cave Creek location just because it has some character with the large water feature."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner since my friend said the the location in Cave Creek was one of her favorite Mexican restaurants in the Valley. However, living in Phoenix and Scottsdale, we decided to go to the Fountain Hills location. Plus, another friend lives there so it was a more central location for all of us. 

We arrived around 7 and it wasn't crowded at all, we got a table right away. We got chips and salsa to start which was perfect since I was really hungry with it being way past my dinner time. One of the girls got a pomegranate margarita and she said that it was really sweet but good. I got the fish tacos and they were delicious. Probably the best fish taco I've had. I was expecting some sort of fried fish, probably cod. I was pleasantly surprised that it was grilled and the two tacos came wrapped up in the foil pouch they were cooked in. It also had this really good sauce. The hard shell tacos that my friends got also looked really good. The shell looks homemade, fried, and super crispy. My friend asked for extra cheese which they brought out in a small dipping bowl. She was also charged extra for this. The tacos didn't come with that much cheese to begin with, so that's kind of a rip-off. The price isn't that cheap either, I would definitely say it's on the pricey side.  

The atmosphere was just okay. I was reading how it's the most romantic location, etc. but maybe they're just referring to the Cave Creek location. All of the employees were nice and even took a group photo of us at the end since my friends were visiting from all over. I definitely want to go to the Cave Creek location in the future to see what all the fuss is about, but it'll definitely be more of a special occasion thing since it's definitely a hike from Scottsdale. In the mean time, I'll stick to my other local favorites for tacos."}
{"text":"Simple, good enough Mexican food.  I can only imagine that AZ has WAY better Mexican food, as Kansas City has places that are leaps and bounds above this place...but it was tasty enough.

We arrived around 7:00 and were one of the last tables to be sat before the whole place was full.  Our waitress was quick and attentive and got our drinks to us.  Margaritas were pretty standard, but slightly strong.  Bonus!

Chips were stale.  They came out with three salsas: a spicy, DELICIOUS tomatilla sauce (which I loved, and I usually don't like tomatillas.  Pleasant surprise!), a mild salsa and a hot chipotle salsa.  The menu says chip refills are .95 cents after the first free basket, but our waitress took the basket and refilled it twice without asking us.  Hmm.  Not sure if that was added on the bill...mom paid (Heyo!) but she didn't say anything so maybe we lucked out.

Our food took quite a while to get out, but I saw a guy carrying out HUGE trays full of plates out to the patio so perhaps we got in right behind those parties.  I ordered the tamales, but ordered two of the green chile variety, instead of one of those and a beef one, as the menu states.  These were...OK.  Lots and lots and lots of masa and barely any filling.  They were covered in a tasty verde sauce and some tasteless cheese.  Since this was technically an appetizer, I ordered a side of black beans (VERY yum) and guacamole (pretty fresh, but I'm an avocado-obsessed freak so I was going to like it either way) but I was so stuffed and only ate half of each tamale.

This place was pretty standard and had some high points, but didn't blow me away.  Their patio would probably be very fun during a warm summer night.  Perhaps another trip!"}
{"text":"Was really hoping the food would be decent... Not so much. Sent the house margaritas back... Tasted like bad cool-aid. The shrimp was over cooked & the lime sauce w/ it was too salty. My boyfriends dish steak telenovela was mediocre as well. Won't be back   Did enjoy the tomatillo sauce"}
{"text":"Memorial Day.  Not knowing that almost all of the others 
Restaurants in Fountain Hills on a Monday, we called El Encanto.
They promptly made reservations for our party.

The waiter was sharp and the food was excellent.  We are blessed
To have this gem right here in our back yard."}
{"text":"Absolute worst  service ever!!!! Had to get our own napkins after waiting 20 minutes while on outside Patio, only one other table with customers outside. Rice was burnt and food was horrible. 
Even our children noticed the difference. 
Been going to the cave creek location for over 20 years. I'll never come back here again."}
{"text":"The food is great!  But I was refused to be seated because I was disabled with prostretic legs and too short to sit at the bar being single. She said I'm sorry but we can't seat you if your single. She saw I was disabled But mostly I was single on Valentine's Day. She was taking walkins behind me but they had 4 people. That's discrimination. Sad because I go there  once a week all year long. I'm a permanent resident. The food is great but don't go if you want the bar room or specially single! I called from parking lot and ordered take out. Sad sad sad"}
{"text":"Can beat the pollo fundido!  They have a super cute outside area.
I keep trying other food but nothing is as good as their specialty."}
{"text":"Yum! I have been to this place twice already since it opened. The food is delish and the service was good. 

They're chips are obviously made in house (versus most of the other Mexican restaurants in the valley who get them delivered). They offer 3 kinds of salsa- their house mild salsa, a chipotle and a spicy tomatillo.  The salsas are good, the only downer is that they only provide one basket of chips, then charge for each additional basket after that. My family can go through salsa and chips in no time so this was a downer. On the contrary, the food seems to come out of the kitchen really fast (even for a Mexican restaurant) so we didn't notice the difference as much as we could have.

I go the Plato de Mexicano. It consists of A cheese enchilada, beef taco and a red chile tamale. Served with refried beans for $11.95. A good sized plate. Everything was good, they don't have your run of the mill enchilada sauce which is nice. 

I have had the scallop and shrimp enchiladas (I believe it was a special). It was really good, served with a spicy fundido sauce, rice and beans. 

Someone else at my table had the Plato Burro which is a fresh flour tortilla filled with green chile, shredded chicken, beef or vegetables. Served with rice and beans for $10.95. She opted fir the beef and said it was awesome. 

I would highly recommend this place. About time we got another sit down Mexican restaurant in Fountain Hills. The only reasons I did not rate this place 5 stars was because of the chips and salsa issue and the fact that they have a TON of staff working there (we counted 20 lol) and we felt kind of rushed both times. It was nothing that our waiters did, just the vibe we got from so much staff running around. Don't let this hold you back. This place is worth it and is awesome and everyone we have interacted with has been super friendly. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place - kind of addicted to the Pollo fundido I keep thinking I will try so.ething else but I can't! Margaritas are tasty but can pack a punch. Love it.... may have to go there tonight..."}
{"text":"Poor service and they have ruined the El Encanto brand!  No one here eating beside us outside on the patio and it took a half hour to get our order on a Saturday!  Seems like this place has hiked up the original prices Vs Cave Creek restraunt, I won't come back to this one again, but I'll give Cave Creek one more shot, if you come here block out an hour of your time to eat ...even if your literally the only customer in the restraunt with 5 employees on hand!  At least one server gave us water....terrible way to conduct business especially to loyal customers"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican food places in the entire state. Fountain Hills is lucky to have this gem. They started in Cave Creek and expanded to three locations after building thousands of die hard fans. The chips and salsa will give you an immediate idea of the treat that is in store next. The Pollo Funditio and Carne Asada are magnificent. The seating is extra comphy too. To put it bluntly \"I love El Encanto\"."}
{"text":"The worst customer service. We were sitting there for  half an hour after we got seated for someone to come take our oder. We got the chicken fajitas and to be blunt there were more bell peppers then chicken and that was around 16 dollars. Not really worth it. The only thing good was the Pollo fondido.  But even that the dinner portion was way too small for 12 dollars. We didn't even get beverage refilled. Over all i would not go back and if I do it would be a small Pollo fondido."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I just love the service and food here! I'm a big fan of the cheese and chicken enchiladas with green sauce (Awesome!) Veronica was my server and was very attentive! Love it here!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service: Tip: you can order a side of Guac instead of the full appetizer if you don't need the full amount. Great Margaritas too!"}
{"text":"I walked in with a 4-year-old to make a reservation for 6pm and was told they were all booked. It was Cinco de Mayo. So I said can we be seated now? (4:45pm) The hostess said let me see. After 10 mins. she said follow me. Seating us outside in a quaint outdoor area with a pretty waterfall. I asked for a booster seat and she said probably not but that she would ask the manager. OK that was weird. She never came back. The waiter seemed very flustered and had what looked like an uncovered infected wound on his palm. I ordered a margarita. The bus boy brought salsa and chips. The smokey salsa I thought tasted like there was soap in it. I asked the waiter for another. I asked the bus boy what was the best thing on the menu he offered the Fundido and Carne Asada. I ordered the latter. The margarita tasted like a fruit punch not the good kind which is what probably attracted the flies. This is no lie there must have been over 30 flies attacking our faces and biting our legs. It was horrible. I asked to be moved into the shade and they said they were all reserved. There were 5 available tables at 5:05 when we asked. More on that later.  The Carne Asada was flavorful however it was 1/2\" thick. I was thinking it would be thicker than a McDonalds hamburger since it cost $19. It was served with dried out Spanish rice and refried beans which were tasteless and something they called guacamole which was really just mashed avocado. 20 mins later I asked the bus boy if he could bring that salsa. He brought it immediately yet it still tasted the same. I had a friend join me and we ordered Cadillac Margaritas which were excellent. The flies were ridiculous. I could see the flies had dispersed to other tables watching patrons wildly thrashing at them. I was thinking thank God they ordered food so they could share in the misery of the flies.  We left at 6:30 and those coveted fly-less tables in the shade were still empty."}
{"text":"This place has lots of charm and atmosphere. Great margaritas, and awesome food.  Pollo Funding has always been my favorite dish, and it us consistently excellent!!! I highly recommend this place, as well as its original location in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"We had the pollo Fundido and the Fajita taco salad and let me tell you, they were amazing. Even though we ordered the small Fundido, it was enough to share. The salsa is so so. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Service was good/fast, food was just average, blended margaritas were delicious! I would go back just to have a margarita. They give you 3 salsas to try and I only liked one of them. I had the quesadillas and they were good, but that was the only thing on their small menu that I would have eaten (I'm pretty picky)."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were SO excited to try this restaurant. When we moved down here during the summer it was closed for construction, so the anticipation of this restaurant built up. 

1. We we got there we were seated very quickly. We were greeted at our table very quickly with chips and salsa (very nice display). The salsa was terrible. It's sad when you go to a Mexican restaurant and look forward to the chips and salsa and they can't even get that right. 

2. After we were greeted with our waters, chips and salsa, the waiter came fairly quickly to greet us again. By this time we have mentioned two times that this was our first time there. The waiter told us he would give us a couple minutes to look over the menu and he would be back to help if needed. We sat there and decided what we wanted and then we sat there, and sat there, and sat there.... 20 minutes went by since the last time our server came to greet us. We watched him bus a table right behind us. We watched him talk to multiple tables. We watched him greet guests at the front, seat them, and give them menus. We finally decided to get up and leave and even then he STILL didn't notice us. 

We let the hostess know and then we left. Very, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a fabulous wait staff!!  The food was almost too good- I am stuffed and ate way more than I should have. But it was soooo good!!!  I could easily eat here 3-4 times a week."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful first time experience dining here tonight. Our server, CC, was such a sweetheart and was great! She checked on us thoroughly and made sure we were happy and all set with everything we had ordered. I had the Pollo Fundido, and let me tell you.... When it comes to PF, I am picky. This was the BEST Pollo Fundido I have ever had. I will definitely be back and hope CC is our server again :)"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Az!! We drive from Chandler to eat here! Ahi Tuna tacos are amazing and the margaritas too!! The service is impeccable..."}
{"text":"Decent food, friendly service, but a little over-priced."}
{"text":"We were in town and stopped in for dinner? Fantastic service, reasonable prices! The Enchiladas De Pollo Con Mole is amazing! Yummy salsa, good experience all around! Andy was excellent, knowledgeable and a great server!"}
{"text":"This was a surprisingly great find. 
Love the authentic atmosphere and the palms strung with lights. My friend had the best tamale we'd ever eaten- the corn was sweet and soft. My other friend's enchiladas with Mole sauce were delicious and my Chicken chimichanga with Jalepeno cream cheese sauce was scrumptious!! I'd drive out to Fountain Hills from Phoenix again just to go to this place!"}
