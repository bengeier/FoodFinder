{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! The staff is extremely friendly & hard working. When I wasn't sure if I would like spaetzle they brought me some to try (and didn't charge me). They have an accordion player there at night. It's not the typical Americanized German restaurant. The owner is actually from Germany and the food seems authentic. The food is amazing and big servings! It's a little pricey, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Great ambience, staff was nice but service was slow and despite being slow my schnitzel was undercooked.  However I was so hungry from waiting so long didn't notice until I got to the lesser cooked half.  The sausage I had added to my plate was excellent.  However, other people in our group did enjoy their meals.  I would give it another chance but I was definitely underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Okay, this is a definite must go if you like German food.  The atmosphere was fun. It really had a Gasthaus atmosphere to it.  The wait was long so I ate at the bar.  The guy behind the bar was easy to talk to.  There was a lot of old G. I.'s eating with their wives and made for some good conversation.  The service was great.  The food was even better.  After traveling around a lot of these United States and trying German restaurants, I would have to say that this is a tie for first.   If your ever in Mesa, you want to try this out.  I drove from Pheonix during the rush hour.  It took me 50 minutes to get there, but I would do it again in a heartbeat.    Good job, Zur Kate."}
{"text":"excellent home cooking German food. Friendly and welcoming atmosphere. Went on a Tuesday evening, only wated 2 or 3 minutes for a table. We drove from Scottsdale just to eat here and will deffinatly be back."}
{"text":"The family and I enjoyed another great meal at Zur Kate this evening.  This place never fails to impress.  The service and the food is always spot-on.   I have tried several items on the menu, but the Jaeger Schnitzel seems to be my go-to  dish.  I am already  looking  forward  to our next  visit."}
{"text":"Had the schnitzel with hot pepper gravy, spatzle and red cabbage. Loved it except the cabbage. They didn't do anything wrong, I just don't like cabbage. I liked the place and thankfully didn't have to drive to glendale for my German fix. Had a couple nice German Oktoberfest beers to boot."}
{"text":"GREAT SERVICE &AUTHENTIC ATMOSPHERE!  It's hard to find a good german restaurant, and this place nailed it.  Service: staff was very friendly and I received quick service with a smile.  Atmosphere: felt like a quaint German half timber Gästhause.   Food: I had the späztle, smoked sausage and kraut. Simple tasty food, and good German beer.   Not to be confused with the Bavarian german restaurant adjacent to it in the strip mall."}
{"text":"I have never really had a full German meal, but wow, this was tasty. We ordered the sausage special and a schnitzel plate and were stuffed. Each dish is served with 2 sides, one potato based and another cabbage based. The waitress is very german and such a sweet lady, very helpful with offering advice about what is on the menu. The beer selection is amazing. Before our meal was served, we received a few slices of rye bread with butter, and loved it! With all that we ordered, we got out of there in under $25. This place is a great value, especially if you want to leave stuffed."}
{"text":"My husband is first-generation German American. We LOVE this place. Schnitzels are perfect, wursts are like my  husband's grandmom's - so is the red cabbage and spatzle! Authentic!! Service is first rate and very friendly. The waitress was more than accommodated my brother (who has special needs) by changing his menu options. We had read that this place closed and were devastated. SO happy that they are here to stay."}
{"text":"If you enjoy German food this is the place to go. It's usually  crowded  but worth the wait.they change the menu  on Fridays  to highlight a different special each weekend."}
{"text":"We love it! Horst and family and staff are the best! Saurbratuen for the win!"}
{"text":"This was a tough one to rate.  I wanted to give it a middle of the road 3, but according to Yelp's rating guide a 3 is \"A-OK\" and this place isn't that good.  The schnitzels are all prepared the exact same way except for the different gravies or toppings.  Sur Kate makes its schnitzels by pounding a piece of pork flat. Breeding it and then frying it in oil.  This is basically what a schnitzel is but schnitzels should all flavored be flavored slightly differently (not just in the gravy but the breeding and cooking method as well).  Without the gravies the schnitzels at Sur Kate are plain bland and soulless.  Comparing these to what a real homemade/flavorful German schnitzel should taste like is like comparing a fried hamburger patty to a BBQ marinated filet mignon.  The sides are passable - not great - not bad not even just plain good.  All in all the food is just OK, but then again the food at BK or Wendy's is also OK but a lot cheaper and quicker.  I could put up with less than stellar food if the service was great or good but the service is even more disappointing than the food.  Once you walk through the door there is no real indication as where to wait to be seated.  So you just stand there.  It takes forever for anyone to acknowledge that you are there and then even longer for someone to seat you.  Even then they do not seem that trilled that you are there.  I thought that this was just a onetime observation or that my group was dressed wrong, but as I watched the door for our 1 and a half hour stay I saw that every party through the door was ignored and treated with the same distain.  Well to get the 4s and 5s other people seem to feel is appropriate the wait staff must be out of this world  - wrong.  The wait staff jam as many parties to a table as they can then spend as little time interacting with the guests as possible.  None of the waitresess seemed to know the menu or what made German food German.  I had to flag someone down to get a drink refilled but actually the glass was removed but the refill did not come until I was trying to pay (which required me tracking my waitress down to get the bill. She wasn't busy working but talking.) The decor was down home German and fun. We came in on a Thursday and there was a man and woman strolling through the restaurant singing and playing an accordion. This made the atmosphere wonderbar. The regulars all seemed to know each other and the staff.  They all seemed to be having a wonderful time.    Now it may not seem like it but I had fun here.  We sang and danced a little.  By sitting with other parties at the same table we met new people.  That part was great.  If a good atmosphere and a fun time are what you seek this is a place to try.  If you want good food and quality service this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"I'm rating for all or nothing and I am all in. That was great!  The husbands choice for dinner tonight and he was dead on.  I miss my Bohemian restaurant \"The Westchester Inn\" in Westchester, IL for their breaded pork. Never been able to find a crispy delicious breading to match but we have now!  I saw the gigantic table in the middle of the restaurant and was counting the chairs  to see how many family members I can invite.   I had the Rahm Schnitzel and husband had the Jäger. Although he liked his, he liked mine better....me too.  The red cabbage was amazing. I would get the potato dumpling next time instead of the pasta (I forgot what it is called).  We will be back!  Almost forgot to mention the great service, very friendly and the cutest outfits. We even had entertainment from an accordionist.  I will also say it was very clean."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about . We waited about 30 min.. My hubby had the sausage special and I tried the hunter schnitzel. Both came w red cabbage which was the only thing that had flavor. The schnitzel came covered w a bland brown gravy which had canned mushrooms. The spaetzle where cold and tastless. The sausage even lacked flavor. I just don't see any reason to return."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite restaurant. Being a German American, I feel right back at home. Their food and atmosphere could not be any better and the wait staff are very personable and friendly."}
{"text":"So, I had Schnitzel Cordon Bleu With Home Fried Potatoes and Sauerkraut. So let me say this first I been here a few times the first time was amazing the last 3 times I been was not impressed at all not sure if they changed chefs but It's been going down hill. It's still was good don't get me wrong but nothing great."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here prior to a show at the Mesa Arts Center. We arrived at about 4:30pm and the place was really hopping! It was obvious that a fair share of the patrons were regulars because there were a lot of orders for the night's special, pork shank. I ordered the Jaeger Schnitzel with red cabbage and spaetzle. My wife had Wiener Schnitzel with potato dumpling and sauerkraut, and we shared the ZK Hausmacher wurst. We both were extremely satisfied with our meal and would recommend it to any of our friends or family with a hankering for good German food. The portions were large, the food tasted great, the price certainly was affordable, the staff was very friendly and the ambiance was fun. When the music played, I could almost picture myself back in Germany...except for the palm trees outside. The only problem to speak of is that Zur Kate is 17 miles from our house!"}
{"text":"Today I visited Zur Kate for the first time.  I am happy to say that it was a very positive experience.  We were led to the restaurant for one reason- a buy one, get one free coupon!  It was hardly necessary, though, as their prices are extremely reasonable.  The restaurant definitely stands out from its neighbors, with it's wooden facade and flower boxes.  The atmosphere within, as mentioned before, is perhaps a little over the top.  I couldn't help feeling like I was stuck in the German section of the It's a Small World ride at Disneyland.  Somehow, though, it worked and, upon leaving, I almost felt like I'd been on a mini-vacation.  I ordered the Leberkase with Gravy ($8), spaetzle and red cabbage on the side.  While I will probably never be able to pronounce my entree, I did find it rather tasty.  I probably will not order it again, however, as it had a very processed taste and texture.  Not terrible, but definitely not up to par with some of the other items on the menu.  The spaetzle was a bit bland but the red cabbage was very tangy and a nice balance to the heavy gravy of the rest of the plate.  My dinging partner had the Schnitzel Cordon Bleu ($11.50) with the potato dumpling and red cabbage.  The potato dumpling was pretty much exactly what you would expect; somewhere between mashed potatoes and a dumpling.  Interesting, but a little plain.  We both agreed that the schnitzel was absolutely fabulous.  It was the perfect texture and the ham and cheese gave it a unique and very addicting flavor.  We are eager to go back to try more varieties of the schnitzel!  We rounded off the meal by splitting a slice of the Black Forest Cake.  It was a wonderful way to finish.  The cake was rich and moist, the cherries tart and cool and it was all brought together by the whipped cream frosting.  A perfect addition for $3.50.  All together, with the coupon, we ended up with two generous dinners, two large lunches (previous reviewers did not lie when they said that the portions are huge!!) and a lovely dessert for just over $20. You can't beat that with a stick!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we've come here & each time has been phenominal! Friendly service, amazing food & both times we had live acordian music! So authentic & delicious. The staff couldn't be nicer. The only thing I wish I could change (besides the distance from my house!) is the size of the restaurant. If you go during dinner on Fridays & Saturdays, you may need to wait, but it's WAY worth it. I found out tonight, they make their own mustard...I am loyal to Guldens brown mustard & I described it as \"a bit better than Guldens\" if that gives you an idea   ;)    . I just love the atmosphere, long tables, music & food! Please please please!!! If you ever have the chance, go HERE. Pretty easy to find, pleanty of parking & a great deal (prices are great too!)."}
{"text":"I came with my German club. We come every year we always love it get to speak German with one of the waitresses and lets us experience what its like in a average German restaurant in Germany love it. Will come again  -Desert Ridge German Club"}
{"text":"Great food and great beer! Took my family and enjoyed some live music.  Tried the brats w potatoes.   Good! East Mesa favorite."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the atmosphere was awesome! Definetely have the apple strudel with vanilla sauce, but be careful you might end up licking the plate"}
{"text":"Wonderful schnitzels and their brats are the wurst (get it?)!  Small place that makes you feel at home on the very first visit.  They feature a different special each weekend, and I have tried several.  My favorite is between the Rahmschnitzel (covered in a yummy cream sauce) and the Zegeunerschnitzel (covered in a spicy pepper sauce).  The food and the atmosphere bring back fond memories of great meals in Germany."}
{"text":"Great inviting atmosphere!  Good beer selection and food was very good."}
{"text":"Awesome place. The food is delicious,  the owner and staff are truly friendly, and the beer is tasty.  One of my favorite spots in the Valley"}
{"text":"You ever just want to go into a German restaurant and feel like you walked into someone's family party? That's the feeling you will get when you visit Zur Kate.  The pork was melt-in-your mouth magic and every bite was a little bit of heaven.  You can't have a party without music. The live accordion music was the perfect addition to the ambiance. It was impossible not to dance in your seat.   This is a definite must-return on my list."}
{"text":"Went here because of a review on Check Please Arizona.  When you arrive you get a basket with two types of rye bread.  Very tasty, don't often get rye bread...no they don't make it but it comes from a good bakery and they use premium butter.  Save the bread for dunkin and slurpin if you get the Goulash.  I had the Goulash Saturday special.  Loved it and cleaned my dish with the bread.  Plenty of meat (pork and beef) and sauce was excellent.   I agree with the others that the Spaetzle is small and not as appealing as the larger sizes but it was good.  If you don't want it covered in gravy you need to let them know.  Contrary to what others have indicated, I do not see how it would be possible to microwave it.  It would have been a solid ball.  It is simply a different texture.    For my second side I had the German Potato Salad.  Sorry this one didn't look like any of the posted pictures and was fighting to be called average. Just some sliced potatoes and a hint of oil and vinegar.  I only saw one small bacon bite.  Pretty sure they can do better.   Wife has the Jager Schnitzel - just read the good reviews on it...it was as good as promised.  Again the Spaetzle (which my wife loves) was ok...just a different texture than she is used to.  She enjoyed the red cabbage.   YOU MUST EAT THE BLACK FORREST CAKE - enough said.  We got there early 4:05 and was seated immediately. Great staff and service.  Loved the accordion player. When we left at 5 there was a line of people.  But as someone else pointed out; there were plenty of tables in their that just needed cleaned and set.   Finally, to the review who said only snowbirds and old codgers eat there and don't know German food...well we are not snowbirds, but I am an old codger...you know that we old codgers have traveled all over the country and a good deal of Europe and we know what good food tastes like...So you may want to consider the people you insult before you do it and keep your review to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and tasty food, but I hope you're not in a hurry.  The place appears understaffed.  It took twenty minutes for anyone to even take my order, and forty-five minutes past that to be served.  I sat at the bar with another customer who appeared to be an enthusiastic regular of the place, but even he waited the better part of an hour for a take-out order to be delivered.  The wait-staff seemed harried and surly; one of them noticeably cursing a  customer after he'd left, where I could still hear it.  The bar was also cluttered, dirty, and mostly unattended.  During my entire stay, I was never asked if I wanted anything else to drink.  The addition of a live band helped pass the time considerably.  I left a tip mostly because they helped to kill an hour."}
{"text":"Great schnitzel and house-made sausages. Excellent beer list. Super friendly service. A little kitschy, but that's also part of the fun. Had an accordion player both times we went."}
{"text":"Great family-owned restaurant with delicious German food at reasonable prices. My family and I have made this place a part of our regular rotation when dining out. Great Schnitzel, a nice variety of tasty sausages and other items. The potato dumpling w/gravy is a wonderful side dish. The place is small and in one of the older neighborhoods of Mesa, but well worth the visit."}
{"text":"I want to go back there ...NOW. Good authentic German food, awesome service, and we got a free birthday delight and shots!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food.  Hubby loved the apple strudel.  I enjoyed the red cabbage and I had the spicy schnitzel with spätzle (potato dumplings).  Tasty hearty food.  Tried one of the white wines only 3.95 glass. Decent for the price.  Hubby want to go back for the Rouladen a German meat roulade usually consisting of bacon, onions, mustard and pickles wrapped in thinly sliced beef which is then cooked. Served on Friday and Saturdays."}
{"text":"My wife and I go to Zur Kate whenever we want fun night out at a great price. Atmosphere is wonderful and the authentic German food is EXCELLENT! We have met some very nice, friendly people sitting at the \"family style\" tables. Service is always great, even when they are very busy. If you enjoy great German food in a cozy, fun environment, Zur Kate should be on your \"must try\" list."}
{"text":"We had such a great time at Zur Kate! Friendly staff, great food and beer,  kids loved the accordian music!!  Everywhere we looked, guests were smiling and laughing over their meals. Such a cozy, friendly place. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have talked about going here for years- well we finally did this last week and I'm pleased we did! The service was great and food outstanding. I got my daughter to try my  schnitzel and I think she ate more of it than me. The atmosphere was nice with live accordion music. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is just an all-around great experience.  Friendly and welcoming with a fun atmosphere and terrific food.  Went with my husband and sat at the bar as there were no tables left.  But this turned out to be a good thing as it allowed us to chat with the owners.  We ended up staying all evening (no wonder there's never an empty table) talking to the family and listening to the accordion player.  I had the rouladen (special) and it was fantastic, as was the apple strudel dessert."}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  Once in october 2013 and noe in june 2014.  Both times i have been here, i have been blown away by the food.  I have had both the schnitzel and the bratwurst and both feel like they have a little old german cook in the kitchen.  I highly recommend thid place!"}
{"text":"I love the schnitzel  and Sauerkraut with the fried pork. The last time we went there was an accordion player in the bar. I always get the Hefeweizen that I love. The black forrest cake is sooo good."}
{"text":"Dinner/food? In a new or old city I had not been to for a while, it is a 'yelp' search, German home food a first search oftentimes.    And with 'Zur Kate' i hit gold on a Friday evening.  A German restaurant, comfy-style, light and  super-clean, with excellent service. Oddly enough, one of 2 German restaurants in this little center.  Serving the best sauerbraten (marinated beef) that i ever had outside of Germany or even within many places in Germany!  3 thick slices of beef with home-made red cabbage and potato dumplings as sides.  A real art - to marinate the beef properly for just the right amount of time. Then cook it slowly/softly enough to be confident enough to be willing to serve tender slices that thick. Potato dumplings, perfectly cooked. It turns out, it is all the German Owners planning and actually cooking! It puts all the LA area German restaurants to shame!  Plus excellent service throughout and all at a reasonable price!  Currently contemplating a road trip to Atlanta, overnight stay with stops in Phoenix visit calculated in, going and coming back."}
{"text":"If you don't dine on swine, don't dine here.  The only option with the cow is sauerbraten.  The food was basic German and in huge portions. The atmosphere was nothing special. The people were very friendly and there was even a accordion recital."}
{"text":"I will admit I am not a connoisseur of German food, but as a \"did I have a good meal?\" response, I have to say no. I'm writing this review not to be mean--in fact, the waitress (although very busy and all by herself) was very nice and knowledgeable, the restaurant seemed very clean and the food seemed to be safely prepared. I'm writing this review just really as a head's up for what you're getting.   If you are going into Zur Kate for a German beer and some beer food, I think you might actually like this place. If you're going in for say, a family meal, go someplace else. Unless you are all on the same page about eating salty meats and pickled cabbage, go to Bavarian Point instead. And if you have a vegetarian in your party? Just don't.   The menu consists of various sausage-style meats and either breaded or \"grilled\" pork (I had the smoked pork chop prepared on the grill with grilled onions. It was so salty I couldn't eat it). There is one hamburger option on the menu and a (25 minutes required) Cornish game hen option. There are NO vegetables on the menu, NO salad options, NO soups--not even a chicken breast or pasta option (there ARE German noodle and chicken dishes in existence). Frankly, given the total absence of any kind of vegetable option (other than sauerkraut and pickled red cabbage), I would have been happy with a handful of iceberg lettuce and ranch dressing to go with the supermarket marble rye on the table. I mean, every restaurant in America has at least a side salad on the menu...   Bottom line--if you know what you want and what you're getting here, I give you my blessings. If you've got a group going out for dinner, though, this is NOT one of those places where \"there's something for everybody\" on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! We got here 5 minutes after they opened and we almost didn't get a seat! Oh my gosh!!! Sitting here full and ordering more to go for another meal!!! Definitely worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Best German restaurant in town for some good food and brews! Not to mention the atmosphere is both authentic and very welcoming  My  Fiancé and I have been going to this restaurant once a week (sometimes twice) since September! We love it here and always feel like part of the Zur Kate family! If you haven't checked it out yet, you are definitely missing out!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! We went on a Saturday night and had the pleasure of listening to the accordion player. Our waitress was actually German, which made the whole experience really great! They were a little busy so we had to wait a bit for the food, but it was totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I thought I transported to Germany when I walked in Zur Kat. The Jager Schnitzel was perfect along with the sauerkraut and spaetzel. The serving was ample and delicious. The staff is friendly.  Highly recommend!  Don't let the location put you off. It's a hidden treasure."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Zur-Kate will not leave you wondering as to the nationality of the food. It is theatrically German with paintings of the German countryside, hunting rifles and animal heads on the walls as well as it fair share of beer advertising.  The staff was extremely friendly and paitent with all the questions we had for them. It was a very welcoming place despite the non-descript smoking area located far too near the front door for my taste.  The food was quite good but there was nothing outstanding here. There are numerous schnitzels on the menu but after ordering it became clear that all of the different varieties were the basic breaded and fried meat patty with different sauces on them. These were good as I've said but we were expecting something more exciting from a restaurant that has been around for more than 20 years.  The portions were large and the side were a nice change from your average American fare and they do have a nice selection of Germanic beer to choose from.  The apple strudel is worth having as a desert but not if you're dining alone, the thing is HUGE! Nicely spiced and accompanied with with very good ice cream it was a challenge for us to put this away after the very filling dinner but we managed. It was really very good.  Overall Zur-Kate was a nice experience, the food tasty and filling if not exactly exciting and was not too expensive. They keep odd hours though and are not open for lunch at all. Be sure and check by calling them to verify they are open before going out there. We had to try three different times before we caught them open. It is on the extreme east side of the valley so it is a journey even for us Gilbertites but if you're in the neighborhood you should stop by and give them a try."}
{"text":"We went around 6:30 on a Tuesday evening.  There were a few other tables, but it was not busy.  Service was prompt and attentive.  I ordered the sauerbraten.  You get rye bread before your dinner, which was good, nice and soft.  The flavor of the gravy on the sauerbraten was good, it had a strong clove taste, it wasn't just a boring gravy.  The spatzle wasn't crispy like I've had at other German restaurants (almost like toasted breadcrumbs on top), here it was swimming in butter.  It still tasted good, it was just too buttery.  The red cabbage was good, not too plain, not too much vinegar.  The meat however went both ways.  You get 3 pieces of meat, one of the thinner slices was nice and tender, but the other 2 pieces were dry.  One piece was a thick chunk of beef instead of a thin slice, and that was really dry, over cooked and shriveled up.  The flavor was good.  I would go back and give it another shot hoping for more tender beef since one of the pieces was tender so I know it is possible!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in the East Valley! The German food is authentic and just wonderful. The entire staff is friendly and you came beat the entertainment (accordion player). Another plus, they have Konig Ludwig on tap!"}
{"text":"My wife has been looking for a good Zigeuner Schnitzel since we left Germany.  We were pleasantly surprised to find a really good German restaurant in a Mesa, AZ strip mall.  We were greeted by live accordion music as we entered.  Service was prompt and very friendly.  We had really good breaded schnitzels, authentic side dishes and outstanding German biers all at a very reasonable price.  We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I am very familiar with German food due to my time spent living overseas. After moving here I wanted to find a German restaurant. We drove past and decided to try it one night. It's a very small restaurant with probably 10 tables, but it's got a nice atmosphere. It's decorated with various German photos and they had a man playing the accordion.   The food was not super, unfortunately. Nothing really seemed \"homemade.\" I ordered the rahmschnitzel with spaetzle and red cabbage. The spaetzle tasted the same as boxed stuff and the red cabbage was the same as the stuff in jars at the grocery store. The schnitzel seemed like it could have been prepared from the premade frozen kind and the gravy wasn't quite as creamy as I would have liked. Overall it was fine, but no different from anything I could make at home with basic stuff from the store. However, we enjoyed our experience. I may just keep looking for a different place."}
{"text":"Oddly, this German restaurant opened next to Bavarian Point.  You have 2 choices for German food in the same strip mall.  This one is inferior to the other.  There is very little variety here.  The majority of the dishes are wienerschnitzel served with varying gravies.  This strikes me as a restaurant opened by a Midwestern family that may be of German descent a long way back.  They make a good effort, but it is far from authentic.    The food is not bad, but not great either.  It is usually a little bland, overcooked and most things taste like they were prepared and kept in a steamer.   This place is a popular choice for the seniors in the area as it may be cheaper than Bavarian point.  It also has a lot less flavor.  The service is also not great in my experience.  The first time I ate here I waited 45 minutes for my check.  There was a Snowbird singing a German Polka song with a very bad accent in broken German while playing his accordion.  The servers were nowhere to be seen.  I missed the one that had her back to us and ignored my attempts to get her attention.  I finally had to go wait up front.  They told me that they don't bring the check, you have to ask for it when you are ready to pay!  Lucky I wan't in a hurry.    I figured I'd give them a few more chances, because sometimes your first dining experience isn't the best and they just had a bad night.  Sometimes you order the wrong thing as well.  After going there 3 times and trying a variety of items (shared with my girlfriend) I arrived at the same conclusion.  In a pinch this will do.  When there is a far superior German restaurant in the same strip mall?  Go to Bavarian point instead.   The Chef at Bavarian Point has a strong passion for Germanic Food.  He is actually Austrian.  Not only is the menu robust and delicious, his specials are amazing!  The specials are not a way to get rid of older product like most restaurants.  He enjoys making unique dishes to serve.  He makes the most amazing Lamb tenderloins, chops and shanks!  The veal and pork Osso bucco are to die for! He also makes a great rabbit in wine sauce!  The Jagerschnitzel is amazing!   He is an amazing Chef who is very passionate about serving delicious food, cooked perfectly every time!  Zur Kate just doesn't measure up!  Take it from someone who has actually lived in Germany and Austria  (a total of 5 years)!  Not on an Army base and not just someone who went there on a vacation.  Bavarian Point is the best most authentic German Food in the valley!  Go there instead!"}
{"text":"Weather comes to German food this is the place great beer tastic ownerr absolutely love this place"}
{"text":"Food was good, had a great time, will defiantly be back for more. Must try black Forrest cake.....wow"}
{"text":"The most unauthentic German food ever!  If you're into cheap & your taste buds are nonexistent, this one's for you!  Everything tastes like it came out of a can, nothing is made from scratch. No chef working in this kitchen!  You want quality, authentic German food?  Walk a few doors east to Bavarian Point. The only authentic German food in Arizona prepared by an actual chef!!!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Great service and authentic German food tastes sooooo good.   Recommend that you order the Zigeuner snitchel.Finish dinner with some Apfelkorn. Yummy!  Summer hours are a little weird so you may want to check ahead of time to see if they are open but trust me the food is totally worth it.This place has been around for a zillion years and for good reason."}
{"text":"I still love this place- bring from Germany it's nice to be able to sit in a place that plays the music I grew up with and serves good German home-style meals. Horst, the owner, and one of the waitresses are from Germany and speak the language fluently, but Horst is around less and less, and the atmosphere is suffering... That being said, enjoy some outstanding food and German music, it's absolutely worth visiting here!"}
{"text":"I almost hate to write this review, because I'd like to keep this place a secret. Quite simply, go there. The food, atmosphere, beer, service, and entertainment were ridiculously good. The Rye bread was the best I've ever had. Get there 20 minutes before they open, or you may wait 90 minutes. I wish I could give Zur Kate 6 stars."}
{"text":"If you have ever experienced a German guest house, you will love this restaurant. You feel like you have returned to Germany. The servers are friendly and dressed in German garb adding to the ambiance. Add to that the best German food to be had in the valley and you have the best night out. Also, for those that enjoy German beer, the beer on tap is outstanding. My favorite is Warsteiner dunkel!"}
{"text":"I have ate at my fair share of German eateries. Here in the States and in Germany. This Place was probably one of the best I have enjoyed here in Arizona. It's a small strip mall location. But it was clean and all the employees were friendly and helpful. There were 7 of us for dinner. We arrived at 7pm. So dinner service was beginning to wind down (they are in the dead center of Snow Bird/retirement land - they close at 9pm daily). Getting a table was not a problem. They had a decent selection of German beers and wine to choose from.  I had the Sauerbraten, home fries, and red cabbage. The meat was very tender, and the red cabbage was delicious! My sister and my husband both got the Jeager Schnitzel. I had a sample and that too was very good. Others ordered the polish sausage - it was a mild spicy wurst, very appealing taste. the Rahm Schnitzel was fantastic and I can't wait to go back to get that for myself!! After dinner we split a few desserts, the Black Forest cake and the Apple Strudel. The cake was very moist and flavorful and the apple strudel reminded me of something my mom makes. During dessert, our waitress, who we learned was the owner's wife, gave us all a free shot of their home made apple schnapps. It was a nice treat! It was sweet and very smooth. Could have gone for a second round, but it was getting late. Over all, great experience! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"A truly authentic German restaurant with German speaking staff.  WOW.  We were there Saturday night and there was a big birthday party and we had to wait over 1 hour, but we were told that it might be 1 hour wait.   The food is good and the service is fairly quick.  The restaurant itself need updating badly since it looks that it's stuck in 1970s. Overall I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic German food. It was a Saturday and the restaurant was packed, we waited 30 min and we were very pleased with the service and food. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I occasionally stop by here for my Bavarian gasthaus fix, if I'm in the east end of the valley. Beers on tap from Germany and typical Bavarian fare. The service has been friendly and very helpful and the food good to very good.  One minor quibble: the glassware is authentic, but the beer doesn't always get served in the right glass."}
{"text":"I always hear about this place form my friends and I  have even eaten here once before maybe 6 years ago. Finally went back last night and wow was it good. The appetizers were wonderful. The meat was tender and delicious. We will definitely be going back very soon.   Get the sliders and the mushroom gravy schnitzel. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Zur Kate is like being in a Bavarian town all your own. The food is awesome, the beer is great, makes me miss Germany so much. Owners are Bavarian and so sweet. Make sure you check this place out!"}
{"text":"First off, I FINALLY GOT IN!!!  I kid you not, I have gone to this place 10 time and it has been closed 10 times, their hours are constantly changing every season, and I always seem to go there on the new hours, there was one time I went twice in one week, that way i knew the second time i went they would be open (finally outsmarted them!) when i got there, there was a sign on the door saying the cook called in sick so they were closed!!!  Thought I was doomed to never get to eat there, but it looked so great from the outside and the menu looked very good too, so i kept trying, and trying and trying... long story short, it was worth it, I'll try again, and again, and again.  Ok, so I'm not a German expert, but I did spend a summer in Germany a few years ago, so that does color my opinions here..   As soon as i walked in I loved it, it looked perfect.  The staff even dresses for the occasion, which i think is fun.  We had an older lady helping us who even had a slight German accent, she was great.  The menu selection is very German, the beers are German, and there were even grumpy old men (i mean really old) sitting in the corner of the restaurant enjoying the night, it was perfect.  The restaurant was bigger than I expected from the outside, and it was surprisingly busy on a Wednesday night at 7:30, not an empty seat in the house, although there were only two people working the tables, service was still prompt and friendly, they never seemed frazzled this seemed normal to them.  Food wise (that is what matters most right?) I had the Currywurst, (which is actually why I kept coming back, that was one of my favorite things to eat when i was in Germany, I really wanted to try it)... it was good, not great, but good, i think it's hard to get some of the ingredients one would use to make currywurst in Arizona, I've never seen curry ketchup in Arizona.  The red cabbage was great, and the spatzel was good.  Beer was great.... but when's it not?  Anyway, my girlfriend got schnitzel cordon bleu it was really good, with one exception... You see, one of the first things i learned in Germany is that in Germany there is the right way to do something, and there is the right way to do something.  They cheated a little here in my opinion, the ham on the schnitzel was cheep, like Wallmart brand square slice of ham sandwich meat... for reals? Come on, would it cost that much more to use some good slice of boars head black forest ham? You know, something tasty and not... well... whatever that was... other than cutting that corner it was amazing! That's why I knocked down one star.  Even after dinner it traditional German form we were able to finish our meal with a home made dessert schnapps I believe it was apple, it was very enjoyable and made for a great finish to our night!  I really hope I don't have as hard of a time finding them open from now on!"}
{"text":"well the waitress was good, our daughters dinner came out 10 minutes late, the food was just about the worse food i have ever received from a restaraunt. yuuuck.the atmosphere was cool but I'm there too eat and the food was just sub par for anyones taste or culture."}
{"text":"We were taken here by or Daughter who lives in Mesa and wanted to try the Cornish Game hen on the menu.  I like German food so I was up to that.  The Hen takes 20 mins to cook according to the menu,  so clearly it was made to order.   I ordered the Schnitzel Harold and the  spaetzle.  My wife ordered the goulash special.   I did not have a beer,  but they had several German beers,  my daughter ordered a very nice tasting Riesling wine.  Over all I like the food,  the Hen was nicely seasoned and great ,  mine was very good and I loved the red cabbage,  and my wife's goulash was very good the meat was very tender.  I would come back here.  its a very small place,  so you need to get there early.  Next time I'll try the bratwurst."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Germany, and were missing some good German food.  This is a bit of a drive for us, but we gave it a shot.   I had the Jaegerschnitzel, which was good.  The schnitzel was cooked crispy on the outside, I like that.  The gravy was good, but could have had more mushrooms. My husband had the ziguenerschnitzel.  It had jalapenos in the gravy, which could be their nod to Arizona ( this is definitely not German), but said it was good. The service was quick even though the place was packed.  The waitresses are typical German, not super friendly, we had no complaints.  The wheat beer from the tap was good. The potatoe dumpling was a bit on the cold side, but the fried potatoes I had were yummy. We will go again. Best German food we have had in Arizona :)"}
{"text":"There are 3 or 4 German restaurants in the Valley and this is my favorite! I go back home, to Germany, every other year, to get that feeling of \"home,\"  that I miss. In this Restaurant, I get that feeling, too. The food is very good, which is more than I can say for the other restaurants. Are used to go to the one in the West Valley, Glendale, but the quality of their food has gradually declined. It's a cute space but I don't want anything beyond the beer there. Here, at  Zur Kate, I want to try everything, including the beer! The atmosphere is very German, I assume the  owners are German. It was a gentleman that was helping serve, wearing lederhosen, who spoke German and was very friendly. The entire atmosphere makes you feel like you're back in Germany. I had Rahm Scnitzel with Spätzl and Blaukraut (red cabbage) and all three were good. I could have eaten way more Spätzle than what was served to me but I know what a chore it is to make them so I understand the minimal amount on my plate. My Schnitzel was too big for me to find Noah eating so I took it home and ate it today. My daughter had the Rouladen with Knödel and Blaukraut - the Roulade was huge! They have German beers, on tap, and even do mixed beer drinks. My daughter ordered a Cola Weizen. I could have ordered a Radler but just had a Helles. I plan on going back. They have a bar area so I could just go have a Bier, ab und zu. They also had an accordion player, which was very nice! My Omi used to play accordion so it made my heart happy. All in all, the big sign outside that says \"Gemütlichkeit\" does not lie."}
{"text":"I love their Rham Schnitzel and I always order extra red cabbage! Along with the beer , everything makes for a flavorful combination. Whenever I'm in town I never miss a chance."}
{"text":"Lived in Germany for 16 years total. It's really hard to find \"authentic\" German food in the states. This comes pretty darn close!!! I love the owners, the servers, the oompapa band. Who knew Mesa had this in their midst?!? We go here every couple months and it's NEVER disappointing. Always crowded for sure and it's a wee little restaurant. So definitely expect a wait. But well worth it!"}
{"text":"As noted by other reviewers, the decor is We-are-SO-German in your face, yet not feeling kitchy, but just overwhelmingly inviting, and transports you to another continent in this quiet corner of Mesa.  This superb meal started out with a Warsteinner Oktoberfest, a delightfully smooth tasting, autumny mug of beery goodness setting me back $3.00.  After bringing out our drinks, we were also given complimentary rye bread, which had a decent flavor but would've been nicer if it was much warmer.  I ordered Sauerbraten for $11.50, sliced beef covered in a mild brown gravy with a surprisingly very pleasant sour undertone with hints of tomato.  The spaetzle was straightforward, simply prepared tiny noodles with an unfortunately bland taste and texture reminiscent of risotto.  This was definitely skippable and unfortunately the only reason this is not a 5-star.  My other side was sauerkraut, which paired perfectly with the Sauerbraten and gravy to bring the sour taste more to the fore, while still accenting the savoriness of the beef and saltiness of the gravy.  My girlfriend ordered the Cordon Bleu Schnitzel for $11.50, which was a thinly breaded and pounded pork chop, covered with ham, swiss cheese, and a light creamy sauce binding everything together.  The breading gave a crunchy, pleasant mouthfeel, the meat was satisfyingly succulent, and the ham, swiss, and sauce gave it a richer feel.  Truly divine!  I took a nibble of the red cabbage an stir-fried potatoes, which were mixed with bacon, that I found very enjoyable but nothing to write home about.  The Jager Schnitzel that my girlfriend's best friend ordered, was Schnitzel covered in a mushroom gravy, and was reported to be delicious as well.  Finally, for deserts we ordered apple strudel and Schwarzwalde Kirschtorte, both setting us back $3.50.  This was an outstanding conclusion to our meal, with the apple strudel containing tart apples hidden within, with soft, buttery layers of perfectly cooked dough generously topped with a vanilla sauce with plenty of powdered sugar.  The Schwarzwalde Kirschtorte, Black Forest Cherry chocolate cake, was also immensely satisfying, with the ice-cold cherries being a perfect counterpoint to the dense chocolate and frosting.  Stuffed, impressed, drunk on flavors and revelry, the final personal touch was the owner insisting we take some cookies she made from a plate left out at a bar.  The aforementioned accordion player made his appearance as we were leaving, so if you want to hear him be there after 6:15, at least on Thursdays.  Head over to Zur Kate for a wonderful meal, with great service and atmosphere to match!"}
{"text":"I have many memories of German food, since my first vacation on my own as an adult was 2 weeks in Germany and Austria a zillion years ago.  There was something about going into a gasthaus that just made the food so much better - generally they were the first floor of someone's house turned into a tiny restaurant and everything was prepared as ordered so it was always fresh.  Never found anything as good in the States, although I tried.....  Well, DH found a coupon at Restaurants for the Zur Kate so we thought - why not?  It was only a few bucks - what did we have to lose?  Authentisch does not even begin to describe this place!  It probably holds 40 or so. There was a live accordian player (when he played the chicken dance, I so wanted to get up and dance but DH and DS held me back :(.  The decor is right out of a German village.  And the servers are all dressed in dirndls.  So far, ok, they have the look down of a gasthaus.  Next the menu.  Wurst and schnitzel.  Not much else - just about 15 variations on each.  But that's okay.  That is more than enough to choose from.  Zur Kate doesn't try to be anything other than what it is.  No appetizers. No extra sides. Your dinner comes with a starch (German potato salad, home fries, spatzl, and two other choices - I am drawing a blank on them) and a vegetable (sauerkraut or red cabbage).  They also have a Friday and Saturday special that rotates, depending on the week.  DH ordered the special - Rolladen with German potato salad and sauerkraut.  The Rolladen was tender and juicy.  The potato salad was good.  The sauerkraut was really mild - we are used to very tart kraut so that was a disappointment but the meat and salad made up for it!     DS ordered the Knackwurst with kraut and homefries.  The Knackwurst was huge.  And the home fries were real home fries - a little salt and pepper and they were so yummy.  I saved the best for last.  I ordered the Jaeger Schnitzel with spatz; and red cabbage.  The Schnitzel was pork, not veal, but that was fine - it was freshly breaded and fried.  Crispy yet moist inside.  The mushroom gravy was so very good (not fully of MSG and base - otherwise I would be too sick to write this ;).  The spatzl were lightly sauteed/fried and covered in gravy.  And the cabbage was excellent.  We shared a piece of homemade Black Forest cake and it was so good. The cherry filling was tasting of Kirsch or another liquor. The cake was homemade.  The whipping cream was real.  Yum.....  Portions: very large. Quality:  very good. Prices: very reasonable Service:  attentive - I loved the fact that they brought us a liter of Diet for my son and I to help ourselves.   Would we return: you bet!  We are heading back in two weeks for the goulash and strudel."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place.  The waitress' are dressed in German dresses and the decor makes you feel like you are in Germany.  The Red Cabbage is so good!  I would recommend it over the sauerkraut (and I love sauerkraut).  The jager schnitzel is also delicious.  Can't go wrong with any of their plates.  Wish the accordion guy playing last night didn't.  He was too loud.  We couldn't have a conversation without semi-yelling.  It was really nice when he stopped playing."}
{"text":"Food is fine if you don't mind reheated stuff. Pork Schnitzel was OK and the pepper sauce was quite tasty. Music like in Germany. Red cabbage Kraut was pretty decent as was the spetzle."}
{"text":"I lived in Germany for 14 years, I love German food. Zur Kate is the best I've had in the States!"}
{"text":"First trip here 5pm Thursday in mid-June 2014. The place was 60% full, which was a surprise for how early we were there and how other restaurants I've been to in this area do at dinner time during the week during the summer.  Our food was served twenty minutes after ordering. Service was good. Portions were very filling. I had the house sausage on sauerkraut and potato salad with lemonade. My GF had bratwurst and a pasta like thing. Both were very good.   We will go back, guaranteed. No complaints whatsoever."}
{"text":"Amazing Amazing Amazing!  I had the Currywurst along with Sauer Kraut and Spätzel.  All I can say is that is was sheer perfection.  I also had the chance of tasting a few Apfel Korn liqueurs and topped off the meal with Apfel Strüdel.  The waitress, the food, the atmosphere really had me feeling like I was in Germany.  Oh !  and I had the König Ludwig Hefe Weiße Bier , draft.  I travelled all the way from Moon Valley for this and it was well worth the trip.   Highly highly recommended.   Danke!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, service was great. Atmosphere is so cool. Feels like stepped into Germany."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a hearty German meal this is your place.  Tucked away in a shopping center,  this cozy restaurant will fill your belly.  The portions are pretty large and come with rye bread and your choice of two sides. This place usually has a line to get in but it is worth wait. The accordion player brings a great ambiance to the place. You may even get to see some of the patrons join in and sing. If you want a great German food in a fun atmosphere, go to Zur Kate. You'll have a fun time!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food and live music. Authentic German Fare....delicious. Each weekend a different special.  It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"German Restaurant After getting out of the ARMY and had spent 3 years in Hanau Germany, I was in search for a great Schnitzel.  My wife and I drove to Sun City, Glendale and on Indian school to find a good Schnitzel.  My first visit to Zur Kate in the early 80's, my kids we small and now I bring my Grandkids.  Great Food, Great Service, the best Schnitzel in Arizona and their Beer selection is true to form - Awesome!  Their food and the atmosphere is true to the regain, Do yourself a favor and give them a try!  Their live accordion player brings it all together"}
{"text":"omfg why does yelp make we type so much. isn't a simple star enough?"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Really does a good job of capturing the German feel from when I visited and makes me want to go back!  Recommend the beer and sausage of course."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and a warm, inviting atmosphere. Try the jager schnitzle. It reminds me of my grandparents house with some good home cookin'! They also have homemade apple schapps shots that are yummo!! Super friendly staff too. Just go."}
{"text":"This is great German food. I do not understand why then ratings are so low. Get here pretty soon after it opens or you'll have to wait for someone to finish eating as it is packed. Do yourself a favor and get the large stein of beer. The apple strudel is amazing."}
{"text":"Being originally from Germany myself, I was naturally curious about the atmosphere and the food. It did not disappoint. It's a smal place and space is limited, but the food is pretty good and authentic. Although a little bit on the pricey side, I can definitely recommend to eat there. I'll give it 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"We absolutely love eating here.  The atmosphere is laid back and casual.  It has been in the same location for a very long time and the restaurant shows that age.  That's part of the appeal though, in my opinion.  Horst is very friendly and is always joking around with customers and making small talk.  You will talk to him when you go.  Everyone does!  There's an accordion player on select nights that adds the perfect accompaniment to the meal.  The food is fantastic by the way.  My favorite is the rahm schnitzel with red cabbage and spaetzle.  Can't go wrong with any of them to be honest!  Give this place a try, it's one of the best around!"}
{"text":"First and foremost. Expect to wait at least an hour or more during winter when the snowbirds are in Arizona. This place is a Staple to Arizona and to Mesa and centrally located between multiple retirement and vacation communities. Everyone flocks to it from out of town and for good reasons the food is worth the wait. This is a small restaurant with out of this world crazy good authentic German food and beer. The prices were reasonable and the service was impeccable. Definitely will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant.  The service was great, very friendly and helpful.   My dinner was wonderful,  delicious and melt in your mouth goodness.  I loved the accordion music of German music too."}
{"text":"Wow Can't believe I over looked writing a review on one of our weekly hang outs.  Happy Hour Every Thursday night!!! German Food & Beer what's not to love.  Yes they get packed really really quick during the winter snowbird season.  Doesn't really matter what night you go.  1st weekend of the month ham hock weekend and if you aren't there lining up by 4 pm you'll be lucky to get one.    My husband is from Bavaria and yes all parts of Germany make their dishes just a little bit different just like here, North, South, Tex-Mex, Baja style etc.  So to each their own.  WE always have great food, if not they quickly correct, great service, and great beer!!  We have had almost every kind of schnitzel, saubraten, ham hock, sausages, etc...don't think there is much on the menu we haven't tried.  Been going for years!  Wish they were open for lunch to grab a schnitzel sandwich or brat!!  HINT HINT  Sorry for not writing this sooner!!  Oh when my kids (teenagers) want to go out for their birthday dinner they always always request here and a whole black forest cake. :)"}
{"text":"Quaint and quiet atmosphere. Very clean and friendly staff. The food was good, never been to Germany so can't say if its authentic but there were a bunch of old guys with beards and suspenders that made me think its probably pretty good. Like when you go for BBQ and there are real cowboys and fat girls you know the BBQ is good.  We will be going back soon to keep working through the menu, again it was clean, tasty and filling. Good prices too."}
{"text":"First time visiting for my husband and I, we both got Wiener schnitzel with red cabbage and fried potatoes. Holly macaroni this was absolutely delicious! So simple but so perfect."}
{"text":"Everybody in our party loved it and the service was great  The owner and staff were very friendly. Don't leave without getting the smoked porkchop."}
{"text":"I've never had German food and this was a great experience. The food was delicious and the service was great. Enjoyed the live music as well."}
{"text":"First time here and I thought it was so adorable and charming.  I got the jäger schnitzel and it was quite delicious!  The apple strudel was delicious as well.  Sweet but not overly so.  I would most definitely go back."}
{"text":"Short and sweet.  Zur Kate is excellent!  The food was hot, fresh, plentiful, very tasty.  The server was very helpful and pleasant.  I never finish a meal.  I always have  enough for another meal.  Not this time.  I ate everything.  The line is long, but well worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered a light Schnitzel dish covered with onions, a potato dumpling and Sauerkraut.  There were no salads or vegetables available, which limits the presentation and color of the meal.    However, it is authentic German Food probably from the day when there was no refrigeration.  Or everything was pickled, made from basic supplies like flour, salt, bread etc.      Food that the Germans ate \"pre refrigeration\" era.  I really missed vegetables and salad.  They serve beer and wine but can't comment on it as I didn't order any.  My date ordered a pork special for $8.00 with the same side choices:  sauerkraut/red cabbage and five different potato or schpatzel choices.    My schnitzel was very bland, other than a light crust, it was not seasoned.  I tasted the pork dish, that was cooked like a pot roast, but without the vegetables. It tasted good but had gravy all over it.  There were many older customers who seemed to reminisce about Germany.  The service was slow for a Monday night!"}
{"text":"It was a pleasant surprise to find in a strip mall.  Walking in was like walking into a place in old Germany.  The food was good, and priced great.  I had the Tues special, cabbage rolls and my boyfriend had one of the entrees.  Definitely would come back again."}
{"text":"Good Lord! This place was amazing. I am sooooo full. The decor was so cute! The staff is really friendly. It feels really homey even though it's a sit down restaurant. It just made me feel warm to be there. The food is also keeping me warm. I had the Jager Schnitzel with the potato dumpling and red cabbage. The red cabbage was honestly my favorite part, it had the sour taste of sauerkraut and I love it! I couldn't finish it all, huge portion sizes!! We also had the #1 with on a bed or sauerkraut and german potato salad with a nice tall pilsner.   Sooooo good. You have to try it."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying I'm a regular over here.   If you have a German Food & Beer craving ... honestly where else you going, the place next door ... Please!  (Yea you could drive across town to Haus Murphy ... but why!)   Step into Zur Kate and instantly get transported to Bavaria, a real cozy kind of vibe. The owner is from Germany and he sprinkles the place with just enough authenticity to make you believe. Live music on the weekend, interesting daily specials, great service, and above all consistency.    The schnitzel is the stand out on the menu , all the sauces are good. Sausage's are not made in house but taste really good. All the sides are exceptional, I really appreciate the simple straight forward taste of the sauerkraut, red cabbage, & spaetzle. Which pretty much sums up the whole experience at Zur Kate.    Simple Straight Forward German Food!"}
{"text":"This is a very cute restaurant, and has very authentic decor and food. The service is very friendly, and the portions are huge. It's small, yet very lively. Often times they have an accordion player come in. One of my favorite dishes to buy here is the weißewurst."}
{"text":"Several months ago, some dear friends of ours introduced us to Zur Kate German Restaurant here in Mesa. We enjoyed our experience so much, we knew we'd return to Zur Kate again.  This evening my lady and I returned to Zur Kate on our own. She selected the Schnitzel Cordon Bleu with Spetzel and potatoes. I had Schnitzel Holstein with home fried potatoes acompanied by a side of Zur Kate Hausmacher Bratwurst. We also had some delicious marble rye bread. Our meal was outstanding and the portions generous. Needless to say, leftovers aplenty!  We enjoyed the live German music as well as the inviting authentic atmosphere. We'll keep coming back to this wonderful restaurant because of the reasonably priced excellent fare, live music and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Jager schnitzel was awesome, the schnitzel in general was great, but all of their gravies were good too.  Solid German beers and an amazing atmosphere made for a memorable night.  Can't wait to go back and try some more."}
{"text":"I've been jonesing for some authentic German food for ages. So I checked out Yelp and found this restaurant with multiple favorable reviews.   My wife and I arrived at 7:30pm this past Saturday and scored the last empty table in the restaurant. The smell of the food was making me drool. I felt like I was already in Germany, more specifically in Hamburg as this was where the original owners had operated the first Zur Kate. There was a coo coo clock, antlers and other German artifacts covering the walls. There was even an accordion player playing at the right sound level. It was as if you were transported to a family restaurant in Germany.  Our server had the German accent and took our drink orders with the promise of bread. Yes, Germans love their bread. We ate some hearty rye bread and ordered our entrees when our server returned.  My wife had the Kassler Rippchen and I had the Zwiebel Rippchen (sauteed onions added) with Bratkartoffein and Red Cabbage. The Rippchen is a pork chop that is smoked then grilled. The Bratkartoffein is German Home Fries which are German fried potatoes cut into cubes with onions and some bits of bacon.  All of the food was excellent. The Red Cabbage had a slight sweet flavor and possibly the best Red Cabbage I had ever had. The Bratkartoffein was good as well. The Pork Chops were perfectly cooked and made my tummy want more. I will defintely become a regular at Zur Kate."}
{"text":"Great German atmosphere and real good food.  There was a good accordion player and the apple strudel was great."}
{"text":"I really dislike writing reviews like this, but according to yelp's rating guide this is the best I could give them given what happened the night we had dinner there.   I'll start off with rating how I would have rated the place up until what occurred at the end of the meal.   The atmosphere is really cute and decorated like a little rural German pub. Our German friends came with us and said it was straight out of a 1960's little German town. We were seated promptly and service was pretty good. There were about 6 or so tables and just one woman serving so we waited a little bit but not bad.   They had quite a few gluten free options which was nice. Their gravies are not made with flour, and a few of their entrees are g-free. The food was okay, I was really hoping to be more impressed. Our German friends thought the red cabbage was pretty good but were not big fans of their schnitzel or their sausage. The sausages were gluten free so I ordered the Knackwurst and my boyfriend had the Currywurst, we liked both of them. He didn't like the schnitzel he ordered (I couldn't have it since it had bread crumbs) and my cornish game hen had been fried and was really really dry inside. The cabbage and potato salad sides were pretty good. Prices for each were very reasonable and we also had a restaurant.com card.   Okay so the one star reason. I was still finishing my plate when something happened that made me concerned about the hygienic nature of the restaurant. An insect of the worst type for a restaurant crawled out from behind the mustard on the side of the table and made its way to my plate. My boyfriend tried to kill it but if anyone has ever had to deal with these critters they know how fast they are and their ability to fly doesn't help either. It scurried around for about 10 mins until he finally got it. By this point I had excused myself to the bathroom... we all paid our checks quickly and left trying not to make a scene.   So, while I wasn't super impressed with the food before this happened I still probably would have come back for the sausages but after what happened I'm a little concerned about the cleanliness so I have to recommend a no go to yelp viewers."}
{"text":"Today was our first visit to Zur Kate, and we will be coming back very soon  We hadn't found a good German restaurant since we moved here from Pennsylvania 2 years ago, and I happened on this one through Yelp.  So glad we did.  Great atmosphere, we arrived around 4:30 Saturday afternoon, it was already starting to fill up, a pretty good sign.  Amazing food, wonderful service, and the accordion player was great  The portions were robust and the desserts were scrumptious. We enjoyed several types of schnitzel and bratwurst, and you must tryBlack Forest Cake and Apple Strudel."}
{"text":"Great German food. They serve Rye bread with butter with every meal. Generous portions of sauerkraut. I have found the wait staff is always friendly and nice."}
{"text":"One evening here and you will be scratching your head as to why there aren't more German restaurants around. The atmosphere is cozy, crowded, and congenial.  The decor is Bavarian and what you'd want in capturing the right ambiance.  And then the food... I know the German menu might seem heavy and uncreative to most.  But for those times when you are craving something more substantial always trust a man in lederhosen.  This place has incredible schnitzels and sausages.  I recommend their specials.  The rouladen brings back memories of the German family in my childhood neighborhood and their marinara schnitzel blitzkriegs the flavor out of any chicken parmigiana you are going to get at the myriad Italian joints."}
{"text":"German cafeteria food. period.  I had the special: stuffed roast pork, red cabbage and spaetzle. (sp)"}
{"text":"We don't have any German restaurants here in Tucson, just German food trucks (which are delicious btw) but you can't always find them and the owners go back to Germany during the summertime and return in October. We were coming to Phoenix for the annual, Barrett-Jackson classic car show and since I'm familiar with the German food my Grandfather would make and I miss it. Well I was in luck! Not only was there one German restaurant, but there was multiple ones so it was hard to choose. We chose this one based in reviews. We were staying at the Phoenix - Biltmore Embassy Suites so it was quote a drive. Upon driving in, we were shocked that 2 of the several German restaurants in Phoenix are in the same strip mall! The inside is very warm and uplifting, what you'd imagine seeing in Germany. I can only imagine because I've never been there. The whole place smells fantastic. And the food just as good. I had the sauerbraten. One word AAAAAAHHHmazing. Everything tasted authentic. Eat here you won't regret it."}
{"text":"We were in the area and spotted this place.  We had not intended to go here specifically, but it looked interesting.  Upon entering the decor was an attempt to look like Germany.  Having been to Germany I can say it isn't really on the mark, but it was a nice effort.  They have several beers available, but they did miss some of the biggies (like Paulaner).  The menu had typical German fare.  Several schnitzels (wiener, jaeger, etc).  A few side dish choices.  I had the wienerschnitzel and my wife had a sausage plate (I forget which one).  I opted for spaetzle as my side.  The food was fine.  Not great.  Certainly not as good as what we had in Munchen (Munich).  But fine.  The breading was done perfectly, I must say.  Not greasy.  Very light and crispy.  The meat itself was fine.  The spaetzle was different.  They put a brown sauce on it (which I've never seen...in Germany it was more of a butter sauce).  It was fine, but really more like pasta.  And it shouldn't have been like pasta (even though it looks like it).  All in all, not bad. But not really great or memorable either.  Sure, German food does tend to be a bit more bland than other cuisines, but it can be quite good.  This was OK."}
{"text":"Good German food. Their Jager Schnitzel is excellent & the Rahm Schnitzel is OK too. I wasn't overly impressed to give them a higher than three star rating since I've been to Bavaria and had the real deal but it's a whole lot more reasonabe to eat here than to travel to Germany. I will try the other highly rated German restaurant the next time I visit but I would eat here again too. We really enjoyed the atmosphere with the German music playing and the Dunkel on tap was nice too."}
{"text":"From the rye bread, to the Zur Kate Hausmacher Bratwurst, to the Cabbage Roll, to the apple Strudel. ALL delicious and we will be back! The waitress speaks German, so you know it's real!!"}
{"text":"We had been looking for a good German restaurant that served Schnitzel ala Holstein, our very favorite. I checked the menu and the reviews and thought this has to be fabulous. Their were four of us and we had no problem waiting for a table. It wasn't such a long wait. The restaurant is small but cozy and the staff were very helpful. We placed our orders and when they put my plate in front of me I just looked at it and turned to the server to ask where was the balance of the ingredients. All I had on my plate was a cutlet (not veal, which is how this dish should be made) and a fried egg, a small one at that!!!! My husband looked at me and said what is this?  The server said that was the way they make it. No anchovies and no capers which are the ingredients that make the dish!!! In foresight I should have sent it back and ordered something else, but I didn't and I was so very disappointed. You can't say you are serving a well known dish but are not preparing it correctly. They served a pork cutlet with a small egg on top. No sauce or anything to make up for the lack of the traditional ingredients. Also, we sat down at 7:00 and were immediately told they were out of potato dumplings and spatzles. The other couple was not thrilled with their dish either. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Walked in an panicked- could only  see old people. Will my food be bland? Shocker- yes it was! But got a pitcher if beer for 9$ and some guy was playing an accordian. Nifty!"}
{"text":"This place is full of senior citizens and is located near many retirement communities. Atmosphere is 3/5; food is 3/5, service is 3/5.. Nothing special, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Don't go hungry. If you do you might actually die waiting to get in and get food. You need to get here about an hour or so before your stomach starts grumbling so your appetite can build and you don't end up eating your menu.  We arrived around 6:30, two adults and one 13 month old. Requests for table with highchair was left with the host. 30 minutes pass and we are seated at a booth, no high chair allowed. Rather than wait for a table to open we take the booth and decide wrestling the baby will help burn calories from this calorie laden German feast we are about to chow down on.  We order our schnitzel and sausage and it takes about 45 minutes for the food to come. So we fill up on 3 slices of rye bread and drain our drinks waiting. Food arrives, hot schnitzel topped with cold sauce. Cold spatzel topped with coagulated sauce. Semi warm potato. We are starving and service was slow so I start inhaling my food. I think it would have been great had everything on the plate been the same temperature.   They definitely need more servers, getting a refill was next to impossible. The whole process was slow. We skipped dessert simply because we didn't have another 45 minutes to spare."}
{"text":"As for the restaurant itself it's a pretty small place.  Not sure how the busy they get, but if they ever do you could be in for a wait.  Back to the food for a moment.  We had the special which was ham on bone, and Zwiebel Schnitzel with onion. The special was good and Schnitzel was just okay.    The atmosphere was nice and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"So delicious and we shall return!  Also, accordion player in the background is a major plus!"}
{"text":"The best German food I have had in Arizona.  Everything from the bread we were served when we sat down to the apple strudel we had at dessert was so authentic and so delicious. Not to mention the wait staff was super friendly and our meal was SO inexpensive.   I will gladly come back and enjoy a wonderful meal any time!!"}
{"text":"We went with friends and was very pleased with the choice. It's located in a cramped strip mall so naturally a place you could easily miss. It was a transformation from the desert into a traditional German bier stubbe. Large menu. The schnitzel was delish. I had the bratwurst which was excellent. I recommend the red cabbage over the sauerkraut. Good selection of German beers. Waitstaff was pleasant. Along with the accordion player playing German folk songs and waltzes. (So wanted to request Proud Mary but didn't.) you won't be disappointed with the quality of quantity of food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! We had a little bit of everything and it was all fantastic! Authentic German restaurant even with an accordion player playing for tips on a Saturday night. The place was packed! We waited about 15 minutes for a table arriving at 4:45pm. The service was prompt and very attentive. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Just ate here this past Friday and was not impressed in the least.  I have eaten here in the past and the food, while nothing to rave about, was decent.  This time, nothing was edible.  Ordered Weinerschnitzel, german roast potatoes and red cabbage. Worst food ever, dried out cardboard consistency with the pork, boiled, not roasted potatoes, red cabbage with no taste or seasoning, nothing had any seasoning.  My wife was served a sausage that wasn't properly cooked and the same boiled potatoes. Stay away if you want edible food.  Additionally while this is an older restaurant in an old strip area in E. Mesa, the time to invest in new chairs is essential.  The chair I sat on was really broken down and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Just barely edible.  Schnitzel was school lunch room quality.  I couldn't believe how bland and awful the food was.  Spätzle tasted like unseasoned soggy rice.  Wow.  Bad."}
{"text":"Wanted something different for our anniversary dinner.  After reading the reviews of several options we selected Zur Kate.  WE WEREN'T DISAPPOINTED!  The place is small and intimate.  The live music is at just the right background volume.  The portions are delicious and ample!  And I had the light German Pilsner that was light straw in color and well hopped - delicious!  (My wife had the Gewurztraminerr of course).  We had the Rahm Schnitzel was excellent with the spatzle and red cabbage.  We will be returning and, most likely bringing a large group of our friends!  Oh, don't be put off by the small strip mall location, walking through the door is walking into Bavaria!"}
{"text":"The service and the food were fantastic. Although I didn't read the menu correctly and was denied rouladen, the jager schnitzel and weiner schnitzel were delicious. The spatzel and red cabbage were great accompaniments to the dishes. I will just have to go back on the days they serve cabbage rolls and rouladen. There was also live polka music the night we went."}
{"text":"Great food for the money. This is no hofbrauhaus  but then again I didn't have to drive to Vegas to eat here. Everyone is very nice. There is no where to bring a wheelchair. Fortunately I can put my foot on a walker seat for short distances. But they didn't really have anywhere for my walker to  sit. I may just order food to go in the future."}
{"text":"The BEST food I've had in a long time from a restaurant. Service was great and awesome music!! Plus everyone wore traditional German attire."}
{"text":"Not my first time to dine here although it has been several years.  I lived in Germany for five years in the mid-nineties so I was really looking forward to this visit and meal.  I dutifully lined up with the other dozen plus folks minutes before opening.  The restaurant filled quickly after the doors opened.    Service was prompt and nice. I ordered the jager schnitzel, red cabbage, and potato dumpling.  The dunkel beer on tap was authentic. Rye bread and butter were tasty but I would have preferred the bread were warm.  The red cabbage was on point and delicious.  The dumpling just a little dry.    The jager schnitzel was the problem for me.  First not nearly enough gravy which would have helped the dumpling also.  I could only finish half of the schnitzel as it was too off for me from what I expected. A little too thick and tasteless pork, plus the aforementioned lack of enough gravy.  A proper jager schnitzel in Bavaria took up a whole plate all by itself.  Thin, crispy coated and fried, and totally covered with mushroom gravy across the entire plate... yum!  Then it occurred to me what was wrong. American pork does not have the great flavor that German pork does.  Taste has been bred out of most pork raised here.  Plus, the Germans use veal in many cases, which I prefer.  I'll be back; but it will be for ham hocks or sauerbraten next time.  And the dunkel of course.  The waiting line was probably a 30-45 minute wait when I left.  The place is definitely popular!   Give it a shot and bring an appetite."}
{"text":"Owners are so sweet.  Highly recommend stopping here and listening to the live music while munching on the goodness served."}
{"text":"I had been craving German food since my trip to Germany two years ago. We found this little gem on a business trip to Mesa. We were glad to wait for the doors to open at 4pm as we sat on the bench outside. Scanning the menu on the window as we waited, I knew exactly what I wanted; sausage and beer. I ordered a tall Hefeweisen which was gone before the foods arrival. Bavarian sausage, German potato salad and sauerbraten with a side order of Nurnberger bratwurst and freshly baked bread. I was in food heaven. Five stars for the great service and great tasting food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  Delicious, home quality German food, prepared to order.  I love it all (except I would recommend a little more spicing for the dumpling).  Check out the specials.  The family are super nice, too.  Also, an accordion player on Saturday!  You have to order the apple strudel, it's the best anywhere!"}
{"text":"Oh my this brought back so many childhood memories of my grandmothers cooking.  My nephew and I went to celebrate his 25th birthday. He had the bratwurst and I ordered the Wiener schnitzel. They have a selection of sides we both had the spatzel and red cabbage for our sides. My nephew is 6'4\" and he said he was stuffed no room for dessert. It's a small place and tucked away in a shopping center. We both enjoyed the food and we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"My wifes' AUNT had told us of this place for a couple of years and yesterday the stars aligned and we found ourselves at the next to last table a few minutes after they opened. There were 5 of us with differing palates, so we ordered across the menu and began sharing.        We ordered the Sauerbraten, Leberkase, Bratwurst and the grilled Pork chop. The Sauerbraten was wonderful, the pork chop just melted and the Leberkase was salty and delicious on the last cool days of the season. All of the sides were perfectly seasoned. Creamy Dumplings, thick brown gravy, Tart & Sweet red cabbage, Spatzel (sp ..?  I'm not googling that right now. ) and of course the rye breads & butter apps. I was the driver or there would be a long beer review next.        This isn't the place for light meals or health food, it's THE place for a fun European experience. The live music added to the experience and didn't become a noisy distraction as happens too often. (My head was 3 feet away from the musician.) You should be here for \"a good time, not a long time.\"       Also very European is the long single table, community seating for the center of the restaurant. You may be sitting next to a temporary friend, just as in the old country. We happened to sit by some old west reenactors still in full costume, which made the atmosphere just a touch more magical. Imagine cowboys in Munich during the 1890's.        Our server was a model of German Engineering / Athletic Efficiency. She had a big station on a busy evening and never skipped a beat, whether on orders, service, drinks, recommendations or explaining what a Zwiebel Rippchen is. Like a new 911 on the old Nurburgring Nordschleife, it was fun to watch."}
{"text":"I loved the zigeuner schnitzel, red cabbage was great and the fritten were out of this world. I had a draft pilsner. If you are out in the East Valley, this would be a great place to entertain friends or take your girl for a date."}
{"text":"What a find! We learned of Zur Kate, an authentic German restaurant, from friends and dined there this week. The food was fantastic and exactly what you would expect - sausages, schnitzel, kraut, potatoes, spaetzle, rye, and much more. They have live German music to set the mood. Daily specials, too. Our party of four all had different entries and all were superb. The home made signature sausages are the best we've had."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday with a group of friends.  We waited about 25 minutes before being seated.  This place was packed with a wait list over 45 minutes by the time we left.   This was our first visit, but our friends know the owner and have been several times before.  I was told everything is good which I trusted based on how busy it was.  I ordered the Friday night special, which was rouladan.  It was delicious.  The beef was tender and exploding with flavour.  The red cabbage was a little crunchy, (yum) the home fries were delicious, especially slathered in gravy.  My kid ordered a hot dog.  He liked it, which is good because in general he doesn't like anything.  I do kind of feel bad that we went without my husband, whom was born in Germany and hasn't had German food in years, but he was fortunate enough at the time to be stuck in Lviv so he was getting some good eats in out there...    The price is very inexpensive considering the amount of food you get.  The decor is tasteful and has a family feel to it.  The seating is tight but I can totally understand wanting to use every possible space to get more people in. I can't wait to go again soon, but this time take my husband."}
{"text":"Based on yelp reviews, went for the first time. Enjoyable. My wife had the haus bratwurst & enjoyed it.  I had the Jager Schnitzel with sauerkraut & spaetzle. Tasty.      Spaetzle was very tiny. I prefer thicker spaetzle.  Accordion player accompanied our meal. The draft Warsteiner Dunkel was delicious. Wife had S glass of Zeller Scwartz Kay. I had a curry bratwurst as a side in a delicious sauce. Service was friendly & prompt. I liked the food, beer & atmosphere. I will be a repeat customer. Wierd that Bavarian Point German restaurant is in the same strip mall but neither name is on the marquee. Give it a try."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and the food is not really German, sauerkraut and sausages anybody can do, and there's schnitzel is not too hot either, this time I ordered a beer in my food and ordered a glass of water which I never got I asked twice,they put a few German signs inside thereand call it a German restaurant!! The snowbirds and old codgers a go there don't know German food from African food believe me!! Never again the best German restaurants in Glendale Hans !! 100 Times better,at least you get a glass of water with ice when you asked for it!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful!!!! My friends and I went here to celebrate a birthday party . I never felt so welcomed at a restaurant, the company of the servers the jokes being passed around was so amazing I felt like family here ! The food was amazing the beer let me tell you about the beer the best German beer my lips have ever drank . I will defiantly come back and tell others about the wonderful service and the wonderful companionship of this restaurant!  Two thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"Zur Kate is an excellent German Restaurant. We went on a Saturday when they opened at 4 PM. Within a few minutes all the booths in the restaurant were full. The wait staff hustled to make sure everyone had menus and drinks. A few minutes later we had our drinks and a basket of marble rye bread that was delicious. We placed our orders after asking a few questions about the menu of German specialties. Our food came a short time later delivered by the owner. Each table in the restaurant received their food quickly as well. The food was excellent. Two of us had the Jager schnitzel, one had the goulash and one had the schnitzel with onions. Each dinner came with a starch side (spetzel or German potato salad at our table) and your choice of sauerkraut or red cabbage. The sides were as good as the entrees. Zur Kate also has German beer on tap which was served in the appropriate glasses. Overall we had a fantastic experience and meal."}
{"text":"Coming from Austria I was really lookng forward to good Wienerschnitzel and good German potato salad. Bothl were very disappointing. The schnitzel was dry and the breading used was not authentic. Potato salad was watery.  The service was good and friendly and the prices are reasonable- and the german beer is great.  The ambiance is very authentic, too bad the food was so disappointing."}
{"text":"Great service and wenn du Deutsch sprichts...besser. The owner was around and over heard our compliments and in the end we had a complimentary round of apfelschaps. If you have never been to Germany this will be a real close experience (decoration and music). Food is more Hamburg style.   If you know how is food in Germany this place will be an ok for you, but still puts you in the mood to sing a lied!"}
{"text":"Huge line to get in at 5:30 on a Saturday night (they open at 4).  Unclear service arrangements, small menu, accordeon player.  Located in a small mall not far from the other German restaurant in Mesa.  Not Germany but an ok substitute."}
{"text":"The place was packed! We got there only 5 minutes after the restaurant was opened on Saturday, and we got the last available table. Those who came after us had to put their name on the list and wait.  The food is so good and the service was great. They were so nice and dressed in the traditional outfits. The food came out fast and we finished the whole plate. The rye bread were fresh and delicious. We don't need to put any butter on.  I had Jager Schnitzel with red cabbage and Spaetzle. Usually it is hard for me to find the gravy I like, but this place has the best gravy. Since it was First Saturday, it seems like everyone ordered a baked hamhock (pork shank). Next time I need to try this menu."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat! This time i tried the rib plate, so tender and full of flavor,  amazing!"}
{"text":"We arrived just on the verge of dinner rush hour. Had to wait for a couple to leave and was wondering why with a long table had 6 empty places. Though the waiter would at least asked if we minded sharing a table, later on I saw why. The whole table must be reserved for regulars because after we were seated and had ordered, a couple came in and went directly to the empty seats. About 10 - 15 minutes later, 4 more people came in and took the 4 other empty places. Once we were seated, the service was prompt and helpful. The marble rye was  great. The beer cold and tasty. The food, not so good or traditional.  I wanted very much to give this restaurant a 5 but I'm sorry I just can't bring myself to even a 4. The sauerkraut was sweet!  I might be wrong, but it's sauerkraut supposed to be sour? Red cabbage was sweet! My wife's dumpling was pasty and did I mention that both the sauerkraut and red cabbage was SWEET? Best I can say, it was almost OK and this is now on my \"Been there, Done that\" list"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try out Zur Kate because we were looking for something new to try.  We're a group of late 20 and early 30 year olds and usually end up at some chain restaurant in Tempe or Scottsdale to eat. If you are looking for authentic German food then you will find it at Zur Kate. It wasn't GREAT German food but it was GOOD.   I was super-excited when I found out the daily special (Friday) was Rouladen because this was one of my favorite meals that my mom used to make for us (she's from Germany). So that's what I ended up getting. The verdict -- it was good but my mother's (and mine) is way better. It tasted a little over cooked and could've used more of the traditional ingredients stuffed in it. I also ordered sauerkraut and potato dumpling. The sauerkraut was a little bland but stll good. The potato dumpling was my favorite item on my plate. Nice big dumpling ball, perfect consistancy with the traditional crouton in the center.   I must add that we sat down and ordered our food around 6:30 - 7:00pm and I almost didn't get the rouladen. It was the last one they had.  So people must love it.  The rest of our table ordered either one of the schnitzel or brat plates. They all seemed pretty happy with their selections and I tried a bite of a couple of them and they had good flavor.  One thing I didn't like is that NONE of the schnitzels were veal...all were pork. It would've been nice to have more than one option.   The staff was super busy (they probably could've used another server or two). Our server was a german woman who was good but you could tell she was rushed. She actually forgot to put my food order in so I received my food about 5 mins after the rest of the table.  The place could use a good sprucing. There were cute nicknacks on the walls but is defnitely could use some updating. I think if they were located in a larger space it would be better. There was an accordian player that played all throughout dinner and he was very good and it helped add to the ambiance.  On a side note, there was about 80 people in the restaurant (which is kind of small) and I think everyone except for my friends and I were all over the age of 70. I think a lot of old timers like this place.  Not that there's anything wrong with this, it was just a little funny. We did get to the restaurant kind of early though...6:15pm ish.  All in all, it was a good experience and I would definitely go back, just maybe at a later time in the night when the early bird rush is gone so it's not as busy.  The End..."}
{"text":"We set out to find Bavarian Point restaurant and stumbled into Zur-Kate by accident.  They are next door to each other, although I had never heard of Zur-Kate before.  What a stroke of luck.  The atmosphere was very cozy with lots of German flair.  The place was very crowded at 8pm, and everyone seemed to be having a very god time.  The first thing we noticed about the menu was the far lower prices than the ones on menus we had seen on line for other Valley German restaurants.  Many different kinds of wurst, schitzel and chops are available to choose from.  Each entree comes with a choice of German potato salad, spatzel, potato cake, home fries or french fries.  You also receive your choice of sauerkraut or red cabbage.  A salad bar is included, and basket of rye bread delivered to the table.  There is not an entree on the menu over $12, and you can add a wurst to any entree for $2.50.  Beers are in the $2-$4 range - where does that happen?  These prices are already amazing, but then you see the portion sizes.  The schnitzels are huge, and each comes with a generous portion of side.  I had the Rhein Schitzel - juicy pork, lightly breaded and fried until golden bown and crisp, topped with sauteed onions and a sour-cream based light gravy.  It was fantastic.  Very well seasoned, light, not greasy and absolutley huge.  Add in the red cabbage and spatezel and you have a formidable meal.  I added a knockwurst just to try it, and there was no way that I could finish my dinner.  Everyone at my table felt the same about their meals.  This place is a gem and should not be missed.  I really cannot imagine what more you could want out of a German restaurant, except maybe higher prices.  Im sure the other restaurants in town are also good, but we cant wait to go back to Zur Kate."}
{"text":"Terrific authentic German food. Can't beat the sausages and brats. Spaezle is authentic too."}
{"text":"Zur Kate is unique to the area (well, except for the Bavarian restaurant in the same plaza) and offers some really great food. I love coming here for the comfort food and the quality has never disappointed. I love their Black Forest cake, too!"}
{"text":"We came here for my dad's retirement get together (he's friends with the owner) and it was pretty dang good. I only ate off of my parents plates since I wasn't very hungry, but the cabbage was so good. I don't remember exactly what either of them got, but it was so good; I wish I had been hungrier. The apple schnapps were to die for."}
{"text":"The food is great! Too many schnitzels to choose from and every one I have had is great. Try the rouladen if you happen to go when it's a special, it is amazing! Service is good and the portions are too big to eat in one sitting, you will be taking some home. Nice selection of imported German beer, so don't expect to get a domestic brew."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place for the first time tonight. The food, service and price were all fantastic!  The food was real, authentic recipes from Germany. Everything tasted perfect and the serving sizes were more than generous. Will be coming back often for, hopefully, many years to come."}
{"text":"Best German food in town, live music on Fridays. The customer service is really great here. They make you feel at home."}
{"text":"Zur Kate 4815 E Main St Mesa, AZ  85205  Five of us met at Zur Kate for a German dinner. The owner is from Germany, and we were looking forward to some real German food. For two of us, it started with 30 ounce steins of Warsteiner Dunkel beer. Dark, cold, and very satisfying. Live accordion playing was taking place in the room next to us, and we soon found ourselves toe tapping to the music.  Fresh rye bread was brought to the table. It was soft and delicious, though I would have enjoyed it more if it had been just a bit warm.  Our waitress was friendly and efficient. I ordered the Jagerschnitzel with spaetzle and a side of curry wurst. Companion 1 ordered the exact same dish, while companion 2 ordered the Leberkase with gravy. Companion 3 ordered the curry wurst with home fries and companion 4 ordered the zwiebel rippchen which is a smoked pork chop with grilled onions.  With the exception of companion 2, everyone enjoyed their dishes and were totally stuffed.  Companion 2 felt that the food needed more seasoning and was a bit dry. Then again, Leberkase is a finely ground sausage loaf that can easily be a bit on the dryer side because the meat is chopped so fine.  I got to taste companion 4's pork chop and it was absolutely delicious as well as mouth wateringly tender.  For dessert, I ordered the apple strudel and was unable to finish it because I was so full. Companion 1, 3 and 4 all ordered the Black Forest cake and pronounced it wonderful. (It had a touch of booze in it which may have caused them to say that)! Unfortunately, they were sold out of the cheese cake for the evening.  When the bill came I initially thought there must have been a mistake because the bill was so low and we ate so much, but reviewing it showed no mistake. The food was quite reasonable, especially since I would have liked a wheel barrow to get out the door.  The only fault I could find was that it was fairly warm inside. Even with the door open, the temperature was a bit too warm. A bit of air conditioning would have been really helpful.  Since every table was taken it was a bit noisy inside, but in truth, most German restaurants are not exactly quiet and they usually have an atmosphere of conviviality and fun.  Everything was clean, and service was as expected.  4 stars for good food, good atmosphere, and cleanliness."}
{"text":"We stumbled onto this place and it was AMAZING.  Everything was tired was unbelievable. This place is a hidden gem, and the service for a place this busy is outstanding. This will become a regular for us."}
{"text":"I'm a bit surprised by the rating that this restaurant receives. Service, and ambience, are great in this restaurant. However the food is subpar, cafeteria at best . everything tasted as if it had been microwaved. The Spätzle did not taste anything like Spätzle  , and the sauerkraut seemed to have been purchased at Big Lots, which I do as well, but then I also cook it for another hour or so to get the flavor to what it needs to be. Also, all the schnitzels that we ordered were soggy,  so obviously thrown into microwave.  Lol. I wouldn't recommend this to any Germans, but if you are American and don't know what German food tastes like, than this might be something to try out...? As said, German ambiance is definitely the best part in this restaurant. Stay away from the food and have a beer instead."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined last night at this little gem of a restaurant in Mesa.  We both wanted the same entree (Jagerschnitzel), but at least chose different sides with our meals.  The schnitzel was perfectly prepared, with very light breading.  The mushroom sauce was delicious.  My wife had the red cabbage and the spatzle, and eaved about both (I snuck a taste, too, and have to agree!).  I enjoyed sauerkraut (among the best I've ever had), and German potato salad.  The potato salad, was fine, but did not impress me as much as the rest of the meal.  We did not have dessert.  The service, was slow (thus 4 stars instead of 5), but this place definitely deserves a visit."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good German restaurant for years. And we found it in Mesa. AZ. We got here early when they opened and there was a line. Our waitress was a hoot. Even with a party of 16 sitting down when we did the service was fast and impeccable. And OMG the food was great. I had Bratwurst with a curry sauce. My husband had the Cordon Blue Schnitzel. Sides were red cabbage,sauerkraut, and German potatoes salad. All excellent.  Black Forest Cake went home with us. This place is way out but well worth the drive.  We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very good German food.  We had a party of 15 and they had excellent service. On weekends they have a live accordian player."}
{"text":"Went to Zur Kate last Friday evening. We got seated within 5 minutes..lucky I guess since this restaurant has good reviews. I recommended to my wife any of the schnitzels while I ordered the pork roast (special that evening).   My food was very good but I kicked myself afterwards for not following my own recommendation.  The Rahm schnitzel was to die for...absolutely amazing. My taste buds were very happy when my wife gave me 2 bites  of her plate. Order with the spaetzle and red cabbage and you will be happy.  We ended with the Apple Struddle and cheesecake..fantastic...although the Struddle  was a little bit soggy for our taste. - Service was excellent..decor and atmosphere felt relaxing and homey.  I will go back there for sure."}
{"text":"Authentic German Food!  The best part was that I was in the company of 2 German dudes!  Thanks to a great host who was a regular at this place,  we had the best service with the drinks flowing at just the right times.  Bratwurst and schnitzel with all the fixings was nice and savory.  The portions are generous and most importantly the service is friendly and dressed like in the German Costumes.   Thanks for inspiring our family to take a trip to Germany! Come to place to enjoy great German food!"}
{"text":"First time here and it's a small homey place.  The food was delicious!   Service is excellent!  Not a large selection of beer/liquor choices but still good German beer and the home made schnapps is beyond smooth.   We had the schnitzel which was yummy!   I tried the spaetzle and it was amazing.  Hubby had the fries and I had to steal some because they are delicious.  Really relaxed and fun atmosphere.   We are going back to try the sausage menu!"}
{"text":"I have lived near this place for a few years and I have not had food this good since I lived in Germany. The decorations are a little bit over the top, but the food is as authentic as it gets!  Sauerbraten was excellent as was the Jägerschnitzel. The atmosphere was awesome. A lone accordionist played for about 45 minutes (started right after we got there and finished right before we left). The music the perfect accompaniment for dinner.  The prices are amazingly low and the portions are huge. I am looking forward to returning again very soon. I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"My first time eating here.  I love German food and this was quite good.  The Cornish hen was cooked to order for my wife, the sausage were flavorful, the kraut delicious.  The atmosphere is also great.  The accordion music was enjoyable but not too overpowering.  The beer tasty.  My wife an I are excited to come back and explore the menu further.  The staff were super friendly.  If this seems a little rambling did I mention the beer was tasty!"}
{"text":"Outstanding authentic german restaurant. Love the schnitzel and red kraut. Always a good time at a great price."}
{"text":"I have dined 100's of times in Bavaria and I can attest that this place is just like being there! Be there early and expect a wait but it is well worth it!  Fantastic place and fabulous German food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the owner is a blast.    I had the rahm schnitzel.  I was disappointed because it was breaded, and it was pork.  Looked the same schnitzel they use for all of them just with different sauces.  Pretty sure it's frozen and not hand made.    The cream sauce was bland but passable, it didn't have any good wine flavor, nor did it have any mushrooms.  Looked like a simple gravy with a shot of their Jaeger sauce for pop.  It was just weird.  But it tasted good, just not like I make it or I've had it Germany.  Could be a north-south thing since I lived in southern Germany.    Anyway, i would give it 3.5 if I could.   It's a fun little taste of Germany that brought back some great memories.  I'll be going back when the rolanden is on special."}
{"text":"My group of friends and I go to dinner here at least 2 times a month. The waitresses recognized us after the first time being there and remember our beer orders! The food comes out hot and tastes great every time! Can't wait to keep going back!"}
{"text":"Bodenständige Deutsche Küche, Mesa ist kulinarisch mit der Kate das Bayern Arizonas. Moderate Preise und König Ludwig für die Kehle. Die Schlembachs hams einfach drauf. Volle Punktzahl für die Kate!"}
{"text":"Yummy and Fun!  I was meeting friends who were in town for the night and they picked this place because it was close to their hotel. Wow, we didn't know what a treat we were in for. Besides the charming German decor, they had a husband/wife team  playing accordion and singing German songs. The duo even stopped at our table and played a couple of kid's songs for my friends' little girl.  The food was great - we got 2 versions of the schnitzel - cordon bleu and one that had traditional gravy but with a hint of hot peppers in it. Yum! Our third adult diner got the sauerbraten which was tender and juicy. The sides, German Potato Salad and Spaetzle as well as sauerkraut and cooked shredded cabbage and the delicious rye bread made great meal. The kiddo's burger must have been good, too, because she cleaned her plate. We then split a black forest cake and a strudel, both of which were yum.   For drinks, we split a pitcher of oktoberfest beer, which had just the right hint of spice.  This is a very small place, so even though we did not have to wait for a table, I could see that happening, especially if your group was more than 4 people.  Definitely will recommend and will return when we want another German food fix.  Prost!"}
{"text":"Love this place. But it was not that good last time we went. It was pork special night. Food were extremely cold and tough to chew the pork. Potato dumbling used to very chewy but it was not chewy at all.."}
{"text":"My mother was born in Germany and my Oma, was from a small town near Cologne. She raised me and is still my best friend to this very day! Never being out in east Mesa, I have been dying to try this place for over a year! Luckily, I was forced to work in Mesa today and I didn't mind one bit! Immediately the smells drew me in as I walked through the front. It took me back to the Oktoberfest days with the German air force used to host and I attended since birth! The music, reminded me of home and my childhood. The smells, reminded me of my Omi's kitchen. I ordered to-go for me and my husband. It was impossible to choose and I stared at other people's food as they were eating! They served every single beer I grew up drinking, I was entirely impressed! It was packed and rightfully so. I waited a decent amount for my food outside but I understand completely. The Spätzle, knockwurst, and red cabbage were to die for! Of course, food never tastes as good as your grandmother makes it! This place touched a special place in my heart and the food warmed my soul! I will be visiting here more frequently, PROST!!!!"}
{"text":"Have tried this place a few times.   We have grown to expect a wait and plan accordingly.   The food has always been good and delivered quickly.   Their bread is served warm and is delicious.   We don't often order desserts, but they are so good here we always do."}
{"text":"Good German food and beer although the beer choices were pretty much the larger German Beer companies.  A couple of local places, Four Peaks and Huss both make excellent Kolsch beers that would do well on the menu here to have some fresh beer.  My only complaint about the food is that mine was drenched in gravy and my apple strudel was also swimming in the vanilla sauce )not that it was bad but just a little too much and the salad bar was pretty minimal,"}
{"text":"Pretty good German fare (good sausage and schnitzel, the gravy was a little bland, but this is German food) and a pretty fun environment on the weekend (the accordion player really gets the snowbirds going, especially when he plays Edelweiss).  Friendly service."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. I always thought that the decor was a little much but when we were visiting my wife's parents in Bavaria I found a place that I would swear is the twin of Zur Kate. I think the food is spot on for a German restaurant. The staff is always friendly. Jager schnitzel and Rahm schnitzel are my favorites. The menu is very typical of a small restaurant in Germany as is the beer selection...both are limited in options but generous in size for the price. The atmosphere is what it is all about and they have that part down."}
{"text":"How have I not heard of this place sooner? I love the exterior, the interior had a cozy German feel to it and the food is amazing. Definitely my new go-to restaurant in the east valley!"}
{"text":"We gave Zur Kate 2 stars only because the meals were edible (barely). When we called in our pick-up order, we expressly stated that we normally go to Bavarian Point and this would be the very 1st time trying Zur Kate.  Big Mistake - HUGE Mistake (...and THIS disgusting mess was to be my wife's birthday dinner).  1.   The weiner schnitzels were dry & the meat had NO flavor - totally devoid of moisture. 2.   The home fries ...well, that's a misnomer.  THESE were NOT home fries, but more like what was left in the pan after all the home fries were served to others.  They appeared to be the leavings - dark, overcooked, very small pieces.  NOT flat full slices of potato. 3.   The spätzle was soggy, mushy & covered with the most unappealing gravy; so soggy & mushy that we could've drank them. 4.   The sauerkraut was nothing special either, with no texture; overcooked. 5.   The only positive was the red cabbage - which was delicious.  We should have ordered from Bavarian Point ...and we will from now on. Do yourselves a favor & go to Bavarian Point, so you can compare too (and don't forget to order their outstanding Goulash Soup!)  Disclaimer: The name shown on this account is not my actual name."}
{"text":"As a lover of all things German, I spotted this place while first trying the neighboring Bavarian Point restaurant. I made a mental note to return to this same shopping center to visit Zur Kate. The opportunity arose when my roommate and I found ourselves exploring the nooks and crannies of the East Valley. As we were famished from wandering around without a real destination, this place immediately inspired us.  Although it was five minutes until closing, we were welcomed into the restaurant by the owner and staff. We sat at the bar and enjoyed great conversation (along with our rye bread and Warsteiner beers). My roomie and I ordered the Rouladen (special for that weekend) and the Zigeuner Schnitzel. The rouladen was perfect: the beef was fall-apart tender and the filling was accented with the bacon and delicious. The zigeuner schnitzel was also quite good with a crispy breading and a slightly spicy pepper sauce. I was not impressed with the spaetzle (although I confess I can be a bit of a snob in this area, since I own my own spaetzle grater), however, the sauerkraut and the red cabbage were delicious.  We really enjoyed the laid-back friendly atmosphere of this place. The highlight (besides the fabulous German fare) was getting to know the owner, Horst, who convinced us to extend our visit with multiple rounds of Apple Schnapps. Truly a great dining experience!  We will return to Zur Kate, to try their weekend special of Schweinehaxe (1st Friday & Saturday of the month). I'm dying to sample their Bratkartoffeln (home-fried potatoes) as I have fond memories of these from my past days living in Germany.  Go to Zur Kate for the food... but stay for the gemütlichkeit (coziness)!"}
{"text":"It's so hard to find good German food but this place does it right!! German owned and you can tell. The place is small but I enjoyed that. They handle the traffic (full on a Tuesday evening) well considering the space. You won't regret a visit. The food is worth any short wait you may experience."}
{"text":"Ill try not to talk it up too much but I have to say it was one of the best dinning experiences I've ever had. My wife and I stopped in and were really surprised on how authentic the inside of the restaurant looked. The meal was perfect and the service was out of this world friendly. Even the owner took time to sit and talk with us and share stories.  I thought places like this only existed in movies. Thanks Zur Kate for the good time and we are looking forward to visiting your fine establishment again!!!"}
{"text":"Terribly disappointing! The hamburger from the one undaring person was the best thing in the menu. If you want want true, good authentic German food, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"As a Dutchman I'm quickly won over by the old world charm of Zur Kate, but don't think I wouldn't praise the food if praise wasn't due, it is very good (just like home). The service is fast and friendly, and they carry a small but excellent selection of import beers. Can definitely take the whole family here, there's something for everyone. Sometimes they provide live music as well. The handlebar-mustache donning owner is a great host! :)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a new, exciting, cultural experience, and home cooked feel all in one, this is the place to go!   I grew up in Germany, and Zur Kate is beyond fantastic.  With it's traditional polka accordion player and it's nostalgic home feel decorum, combined with the extremely well prepared food, authentic German beers, and astoundingly great service, I have to give them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service and the beer flows like water! Highly recommended.  We had the Jager Schnitzel with Spätzel and Red Cabbage. The schnitzel was as tender as buttered and the gravy was to die for. Spätzle was tender and buttery.  We also had a currywurst which also amazingly good and served with a sizeable portion of sourkraut.   Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went on a Friday night.  There was a 45 minute wait which is to be expected.  No pager given.  Just instructions to wait outside.  This restaurant is next door to a Smoke shop.  There were inconsiderate smokers outside which made it an unpleasant wait.  We walked in and saw an accordion player which was nice.  Once seated, we noticed that the menu doesn't have appetizers.  They serve 3 slices of rye bread with butter as an appetizer.  There aren't sampler plates on the menu either.  Server told us that they were out of ham hocks.  Prices were very reasonable.    Wife ordered Bratwursts and I got Wiener schnitzel.  Both were good, but not large plates.  I would have preferred to pay a little more for a larger serving.  For dessert, we shared an apple strudel which was great.  My wife is a huge fan of Haus Murphy and wasn't as happy with this place.  We did notice another German restaurant a few doors down called Bavarian Point.  It has slightly less stars than this place."}
{"text":"Zur Kate is a real treat - the atmosphere feel's like your dining in a traditional German pub. The staff are very accommodating to folks unfamiliar with German fare. We loved every bite and managed to eat about half of our massive portions. An accordion player started playing as we were leaving around 7:30pm. The place has some real history if you read the story on the menu. We will return!!!"}
{"text":"So good!! We waited 2 hours for this gem and it was worth it! My husband ordered the ham hocks and I ordered the Schnitzel. It was our first time there. We also loved the musician; felt so authentic. We will definitely go again but will go a lot earlier to beat the crowds."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner and drinks at Zur Kate. Both of us had sausages. Mine was smoked polish sausage. Just perfect. I added red cabbage and potatoes. Generous portions and delicious. Riesling wine was very good. The accordion player added to traditional German atmosphere.  Servers are friendly and do a great job in a very popular venue. Get there early on weekends or be prepared for a wait. However it is worth it."}
{"text":"My family and I had a wonderful time this weekend at  Zur Kate . The atmosphere of this place is welcoming! There was a man playing German music on his accordion which was really nice. The waitress was very friendly as she took are drink and food orders . The food is delicious and the portions are generous! The price are great for the amount of food you get here. I must say the Zur Kate is more like going to someone's home for a good ole home cooked meal and not going to a restaurant. I highly recommend this place to anyone! I will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"We have been to Zur Kate twice in the past two years. We would go many more times if it weren't for the 30 plus minute drive to the restaurant for us. After the first time we were so impressed we knew that we must go back. If you want authentic German food you must go to Zur Kate.   The decor reminds us of a small Bavarian family restaurant which includes family style seating and booths. If you enjoy family style seating you will have a chance to mingle with others while eating or you can wait as we did.  The staff is very friendly and several are of German decent. On Friday and Saturday nights they have a gentleman that plays an accordian who dances and mingles with the customers.  We ordered the wiener schnitzel with the German potato salad and the sauerkraut The schnitzel was lightly breaded and smothered with gravy. This along with the sides was extremely delectable along with the German ale, \"dunkel.\" We also ordered the Sauerbraten, which was delicious as well. Although, the weinerschnitzel was better. Our server gave us an apple wine shot to top off an extraordinary authentic German meal. Thank you so much Zur Kate!!!!! We will be back again."}
{"text":"Who even knew such a good, authentic place existed way out here in the East Valley.  The place has been around for like 20 years.  The decor inside makes you feel like you're in Germany.  The wait staff was very nice and I thought the food was VERY good.  I had the sausage loaf with gravy, cabbage and these unreal home fried potatoes fried with bacon, OMG.  So good.  My date had the bratwurst with sauerkraut and potatoes.  I thought the brats were excellent as well.  They have a nice bar with a lot of German beers.  The price was not bad, 2 dinners, 1 beer was about $24.00.  Also note, their gravy is gluten-free!  Whoot."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Zur Kate to try something new for my birthday and it was a very pleasant experience. The atmosphere was very cozy and fun. It made us feel like we might actually be visiting a little place in Germany. The waitress was very kind and helpful and the food was good. My favorite part though was the apple strudel! It was delicious."}
{"text":"I went to dinner here yesterday and was very pleased. I had the cordon bleu schnitzel. I told the waiter that I had lived in Germany for two years and I think their German food is better than food in Germany :-). Throw in the accordion player and their furnishings and I was right back in Germany. Loved it!"}
{"text":"came  upon the gem that I didn't know was around.  I was more in the mood for pretzels and beer but mostly what they offered was Snitzells or sausages.  Food was good in large portions. Someone was there playing the accordion which helped the ambiance.  Genuine German owners I believe. I would to meet them one day."}
{"text":"We met a couple of friends of ours at Zur Kate for dinner. I was a bit leery due to the fact that Zur Kate is in the same strip mall as the Bavarian Point. My review for the Bavarian Point would have been a zero - due to the roach on the table! So needless to say - I didn't want to go.   We walked in the door and it looked like you just stepped in to someones home in Germany. It's was cute! I little bit Twin Peaks, but cute in an odd way. They had live music and plenty of tasty cold beer! The menu was NOT in German like at the Bavarian Point - Bonus for us Americans. The food was very good I was very impressed. I don't know much about German food so I relied on our friends who go there often.  If you are looking to try something new, like German food! This was a first for me. Head to Zur Kate and know you are going to have a tasty meal!"}
{"text":"Like the homey feel along with the ample portions. Came here after a trip to Germany and loved it. Like we were still on vacation  Very friendly staff too and we enjoyed not feeling rushed"}
{"text":"I don't often give 5 star reviews, because I feel it should really reflect an exemplary experience, service, or product... at least that's what I really on when checking out reviews for things I haven't yet tried myself.  This charming restaurant checks off all the boxes I mentioned.  Their restaurant exudes a welcoming and comfortable vibe from the moment you step through the door.  Authentic German decor adornments walls, and even the table and chairs take you to a scenic alpine andblakebrute feel at home.  Their is a very talented gentleman playing what I am probably incorrectly calling an accordion in the center of the dining room, and the staff are obviously family who make you feel like you're visiting with that family. Cheerful prompt service with a smile and and eagerness to answer any questions are what you'll find when it comes time to order.  The beer is cold, the food fresh & hot, and you can taste the pride in very bite of your meal that these hospitable and capable restaurateurs put into your dining experience.  Lovely cozy, down to earth ambience with hearty servings.  Everything fresh and rightly done.  I can't praise enough the effort and their success in delivering a truly nostalgic meal, and truly made for a great evening. Can't wait to visit again, and not just for dinner!!."}
{"text":"Yes this is a very good restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I originally reviewed this place for Check Please AZ, episode 1, 2017 season and loved it then and still love this place.  I'm not expert on German food but this place makes me want to go to Germany. The decor, the friendliness of the staff; warmth just exudes from this place. You feel as if you are in a beer garden at Octoberfest. The wonderful aroma of the food you can't help but become mesmerized in this place. They first serve you homemade marble rye bread which is soft and fresh. Three of us had Warsteiner Dunkel beer is is heavier dark golden beer with lots of flavor. Three of us got the special of the weekend, ham hock. Absolutely delicious, tend fall off the bone perfectly cooked and went so well with the great house mustard that was at the table. The ham hock was large enough for 2 additional meals after we left; all for $14.50. Crazy price for all that food which includes 2 sides. My husband and I both choose the wonderful spaetzle with brown gravy and delicious sweet red cabbage. The cabbage went home with us  because it was such a huge portion. The other two people with us got the Feine Bratwurst which they loved and I tried and it was very good especially with the house mustard. For dessert  we had the apple strudel which had a great flaky crust and wonderful perfectly cooked apples with the right amount of sweetness. another had the cheesecake and loved how creamy that was with a great thick graham cracker crust. So very cheap. 5 of us dined with drinks and dessert for $101.00 without tip. You can't beat it! But get there early and expect to wait for a table. We arrived at 5pm and waited almost a 1/2 hour for a table and they don't take reservations. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"The food is good and from what I can tell is rather authentic. Some things may be bland so consider before ordering. Gravy or onions on schnitzel is recommended. The hashed browns were awesome. Great beers on tap also. Went on a Saturday night, the atmosphere was great with live music and the owners kept buying us rounds of house made apple liquor shots. Will definately be back again."}
{"text":"So we've been here a few times and know that this is a well-loved place for German food. But, there are other choices in the valley and they are all better. The meats are typically quite dried out and lackluster. The fried potatoes are never crispy enough, and the sausages are not any more special than the grocer. The saurkraut or red cabbage sides are actually the hits for me. In our three visits, I have never been made to feel special by the wait staff - they are always in a quick hurry to move you in and out. I get it! It's crowded and beloved by many. Just not by me. Sorry."}
{"text":"Worst food in the world my mother was German and this did not resemble any thing like her German potato salad  this was pure vinegar the Sauerbraten was close 2nd for awful it is suppose to be sweet and sour not just vinegar.. I ask for a cheese hamburger and french-fries the woman said that they don't put anything on the burger well it was so bad that the dog wouldn't eat it..."}
{"text":"As best as I can figure out, there are 3 German restaurants in the Phx metro area.  Two of them are in the same parking lot in Mesa.  How does that happen?  So anyway, what about Zur Kate.  Good food but an oddly small menu with no appetizers listed.    As for the restaurant itself its a pretty small place.  Not sure how the busy they get, but if they ever do you could be in for a wait.  Back to the food for a moment.  While it was good, and somewhat German in composition I'm just not sure how authentic it was.  That being said, I could say the same for the other German restaurants here in Phx.  So, not so much of a knock as an observation."}
