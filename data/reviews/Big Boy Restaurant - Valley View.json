{"text":"Big boy is awesome. Their food is always great and so is the staff. My family loves this coming to this location."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, not a great experience. Sat forever waiting for our food. Totally disappointing. There was an elderly couple seated nearby and they waited even longer for their dinner. Our waitress could not handle the dinner crowd volume of business. She dropped salsa on my friend's lap then actually had the nerve to blame him for her mishap. Seriously... What?! The entire experience was like a bad reality tv show. So much for the great Big Boy I remembered from a long time ago."}
{"text":"I love cheeseburgers ! Could eat them everyday !! The Super Big Boy (with extra sauce) makes my top 5 list. It's that good .Period.  Get the fries & applesauce with the platter. Oh, and a chocolate milkshake. mmmm, Big Boy : )  After going to the movies at Valley View head on over, they have more then burgers & it's all good."}
{"text":"Still  love this place - we come just for the big boys and the extra sauce......food is consistently good..................we will be back"}
{"text":"Serendipity does not always pay off.  I was hungry -- what's your excuse? The Big Boy restaurants of my childhood were passable, possibly even fun.  This restaurant will disappoint you even if you like steam-table burgers with dried out buns, day-old salad bars, and 'hands-off' service."}
{"text":"We went lunch time 8 minutes to get to seated you 12 minutes to get a order taken and 1 hour to get our food after I complain three different times that we had to get out of there this was the very first time I did not leave a tip I don't know if it's a service fault but it's place is very very slow"}
{"text":"This was the 1st time in 15yrs that I have been to a Frischs Big Boy restaurant. I had the \"Slim Jim\" ham sandwich and it was OK and the sandwich was smaller than expected.  My guy got their breakfast and said the eggs and hash browns were too watery. There wasn't enough sausage gravy for the biscuits and everything. His bacon and sausage were good."}
{"text":"Been going to Big Boy since I was a kid and it was called Bob's Big Boy and Manners before that. We moved to Phoenix and ate here last month when we were visiting for the first time in 15 years. The burgers taste just like I remember and they still have the \"Sweetie Pie\" or Hot Fudge Cake as they call it now and taste the same as I remember eating as a kid. We found out each Big Boy has either a red or white sauce, depending on what state your in. We had white sauce in Ohio and recently in CA, they serve red. I wish they would come out west!"}
{"text":"Overkill on the ketchup and mustard. Everything tasted awful and was cold. I was also cold the whole time. Service was also ridiculously slow, and it wasn't even busy. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The ONLY thing I eat from here is the Slim Jim .. Well, and onion rings and fries. I love this sandwich. Most of the time the sandwich itself gets a 4/5. Occasionally the taste might be off but it hasn't stopped me from getting the sandwich; however, what might have just stopped me is my most recent big boy / slim jim experience .. It seems the sandwich size is half of what it used to be, which isn't much to begin with. For $7-8 it's certainly not worth it. I called and spoke with a manager to ask if the sandwich size had changed he said it's been the same since he's been there for 8 months. I've been eating slim jim's for longer than 8 months, I know the sandwich was smaller :) I'll give them one more shot, if the sandwich is still lacking then they'll be lacking a customer."}
{"text":"I called this morning and they NO LONGER HAVE A BREAKFAST BUFFET!!!  She said since the renovations, the buffet is gone.  I thought renovations were supposed to improve the place, not make it worse.  What gives?"}
{"text":"It's been five years since I've been to this Big Boy but...  I wish this chain wouldn't die-off. It has some quality and I never gripe about food...to me, eating-out is a treat whether It's good, bad, or mediocre.  I may come to either this Big Boy...or the other one on Brookpark because I also remember the West Park franchise...too bad that one came and went!"}
{"text":"This place has always been a decent restaurant.  I mean if you wanna meet Ozzie \"the wizard of Oz\" Newsome or see Big Boy for Easter then its about the best place ever.   However, with that being said when i was young until now theres only one constant left.  Thats my aunt, and i mainly go here to see her and her boss that looks like a coalminer.    The service if I am with my aunt is always stellar.  We talk and enjoy quick jokes between us.  However, when my aunt is not there my service varies.  I ordered a turkey rueben on my last visit and ended up with a corned beef rueben.  Thankfully i didnt have to pay for it.  The turkey was like carved turkey, most times that would be something to have with gravy not covered in sauerkraut. The meat also i think would have been best served as lunchmeat style turkey.  I dont know if they have that in the refrigerator in the back, but at least have an employee hijack it from the deli across the street dressed in the big boy costume if you dont have it, geez.  However, the rest of the service was alright.  The bill was a bit pricey, running me close to $35 dollars for my cousin and i to eat.  If i was a hillbilly then maybe the idea of having my cousin eat with me as a date would be something else, but hes a guy and we had two smaller portions with a desert."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that when I'm back in the Cleveland area, I'll probably revisit this Big Boy.  That being said, it's got a few issues - most of which are out of control of the staff or the owner.    Firstly, the food and venue brought back serious nostalgia and the Big Boy sandwich was as delicious as I could recall.  The location, however, leaves a lot to be desired.  I felt like I was in Detroit or Gary Indiana; i.e. heavy industry.  But, the road sign said \"Big Boy\" and naturally I made a hard cut for the Exit ramp.   Likely an earlier inception of this franchise, the venue itself was very dated.  I know that BB has been closing down all over the place, so they probably don't have the revenues to perform an upgrade.  The staff was fine, though they lacked the happy demeanor of the BBs I used to frequent in Indiana.  I can't blame them, working on this side of town.    My recommendation: go to Big boy.  A sudden surge in customers would probably breathe new life into this old gem."}
{"text":"I got their breakfast and it was fair.  The eggs had water in them, my biscuit with gravy was cold and my toast had so much butter that it oozed out a lot when I bit into it. I really only enjoyed my home fries and orange juice."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were starving and had never been to this chain before, so we thought we'd give it a shot. Big mistake. I paid almost $8 for basically half of a crappy sandwich. I got the Slim Jim, which was tiny and disappointing. I would have been happier with fast food, which isn't a far cry from the quality here, but they charge twice as much. Not sure how they get away with that. Hubby said his buffalo chicken sandwich was subpar and tasted like frozen chicken thawed in the microwave. I had a taste and it was mediocre at best. We ended up paying $4 (prices not listed on menu) for a shake that tasted like a $1 frosty from Wendy's. This was our first and last time at a Big Boy restaurant."}
{"text":"The only reason I visit this Big Boy is when I'm going to Cinemark to see a movie, and only because of the broccoli soup. Today it was not very good. It was mostly the stalk of the broccoli, no florets. I think it had been re-heated from a previous day because instead of a creamy color, it was kind of orange-brown. However, for the first time, the lettuce on the salad bar had a mix of greens and wasn't flaccid."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a big boy in a long time.  Wanted it to be good.  But the salad had a lot of icky lettuce.   Some onion rings were over cooked out of the 8 you get was kind of sad. And the Cajun pasta dish looked nothing like the pic in menu!  The pic shows a chicken breast all sliced, we got 3 pieces of the breast!!!! I took a photo of ours as presented to us and the one in photo.  Not to mention it was bland and had no flavor!  Had to add some bob's big boy seasoning salt they keep on the table for some taste.    So sad to say we wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"We' waitiedalmost 30 minutes and still no food........when it arrived, we had one winner out of four dinners. The child's portion was so small that he's still hungry and we all left unhappy. Won't be back."}
{"text":"We lost our Big Boys in Wisconsin a bit over twenty years ago.   So in combination with keeping a promise to the uninitiated and a longing for a Classic, we could not pass this up.  The burgers were just as good as I remember them being back in the day!  Fortunately,  my companion was also impressed with her burger choice.  I love the idea of the mini shakes and deserts as it allows for a little treat.    The one disappointment was they were out of the fried clams, which on a Tuesday afternoon is unsat!"}
{"text":"What the heck!?  We went a couple weeks ago for the \"seafood buffet\". It might as well have been called \" the worst buffet you will ever eat\", but I guess that isn't very catchy sounding.  In the buffet they had about 15 dishes, 10 of which appeared to be burning and stuck to their buffet hotdish.  The fish was greasy and flavorless.  The clams were really only breading.  I guess the shrimp were OK, but its basically impossible to mess those up.  After one unfinished plate I knew I was done.  We tried to complain by emailing the corporate office, but they haven't responded in two weeks, so I guess the best thing I can do is warn others to avoid the buffet at all costs."}
{"text":"I had spaghetti my husband had chicken & mashed potatoes. Very good waitress. Friendly staff & timely. Family style resturant."}
{"text":"I use to be a short order cook at a Bob's Big Boy and had the best time there working and meet a lot of great staff and customers.    Where I live they closed in the 90s but here in Clevland they are still doing it old school.    I came hungry and had the slim jim, Big Boy Burger and a Hot fudge cake.  Delicious.    I can cross this off the bucket list."}
{"text":"The last 2 times I ordered food to go i was EXTREMELY disappointed...i even went there in person thinking THAT would ensure me a better result....but...it DID NOT...the 1st time around I watched my food sit under the heat lamp for at least  25 minutes until someone packed it up for me...that should have been a red flag right there...but I hoped for the best....WRONG!...this last time was no better...my onion rings were all dried out and my BLT sandwich looked like it was put together by a toddler it was so sloppy.. and ....an even hotter mess to try to eat ...needless to say I SHALL NOT b returning there EVER AGAIN..."}
{"text":"The food is good, but this one star review is because of a singular event that happened because of a bad manager named Kevin. He used inappropriate language towards a server for doing her job. Jessica was a great server and he fired her on spot in a rude and offensive way. Customers should not have to hear rude language from managers towards anyone!  Corporate needs to get rid of Kevin, bring back Jessica and then I'll go back to my prior 4-star review."}
