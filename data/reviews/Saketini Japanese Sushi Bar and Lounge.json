{"text":"My friends went there for some good Sushi and drinks. The atmosphere was nice, maybe they could choose something more fitting in music, noisy hip hop not my idea of Japanese. Our waitress was nice, but seemed bored. When we called prior to going, the girl answering the phone didnt know what time they were open till. It had been really slow that day and they might close early. The Sushi rolls were very good, hence the 4 stars, my friend order a Hello Kitty drink, it was pretty and pink and was really good, and the other drink my other friend had was great. Good happy hour prices, other prices ok. I would return, the sushi has been consistently good every time Ive gone."}
{"text":"I like the food. Sushi roll are really good portions. Fast and good customer service. Good taste over all and great prices.The only thing that did gross me out was that outside of the location there was a sewer problem and there was basically feces and toilet paper coming out of a hole in the ground,which was really Gross. I don't know if it was the restaurant itself or if it was the Plaza but it was very very close to the restaurant."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite sushi joint in the valley!  
The albacore is prepared the best and is by far the most tasty!!
Their Happy Hour is to die for as well!!
If you like sushi and are in Mesa/ Tempe..DEFF give this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for sushi. Food and service always on point. Love that they are open late for those who have later schedules."}
{"text":"The absolute best thing about this place is I can go here after work because they are open till 2AM. They are big fans of putting lots of sauce on your rolls. so if you order any rolls with sauces expect a lot more than usual. The rolls here are wrapped smaller and tighter than most but the rolls are much longer. I enjoy this place but really only go here during the late night happy hour. because the specialty rolls are about 17-24 bucks and i would much rather pay a third of the cost. the only thing I don't really like is the high price and the slow waitress. I cant really say anything bad about the food."}
{"text":"To me, this is my favorite sushi spot and has been since I moved up to the Tempe area back in 2009. The Chefs are really friendly and service is great for the most part. 

Now, I only really get sashimi so if you really like sashimi, this place has- according to me- has some of the better tasting ones I have had around here. It's a great atmosphere and i'm probably bias because of my history here. 

Happy hour and reverse happy hour are great so if you haven't tried this place at least try it at those times! Try the albacore and salmon, delicious!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place.   Not so much anymore.

They got rid of their smoking patio.
They changed their head chef awhile ago.  Not a big fan of the new ways of making the rolls and sushi.

They still have a GREAT happy hour as far as the food prices go, but the food has gone downhill. 

Crunchy California roll is still good.
They don't sear the Albacore anymore.
They have a website now, but nothing too great.

The one upside was that the two servers that were working last night were great.  Really fast and on top of things."}
{"text":"Pretty good good.
I had the volcano roll, which is baked. Came out pretty quickly for a baked dish.

It was a bit too \"fishy\" to my taste and lacked seasoning.
But the service was great.
Friendly courteous waitress and chillaxed environment that won't blow your eardrums out.

Bit on the pricy side."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars for being exactly what it markets itself to be.  Decent sushi, attentive service & GREAT prices - there is some \"happy hour\" special at all times of the day, always consistent in quality, never fishy, etc.  

Servers are friendly, helpful, easy to understand, and they play remixed trendy music - creating perfect atmosphere! 

Good green tea Moochi dessert. I have been plenty of times, and will continue to frequent this place. 

Only suggestion is offer free wifi. I would sit and work (and eat more sushi) if I could get wifi on my laptop. 

Tuna sashimi is always perfectly seasoned and fresh. Definite recommendation."}
{"text":"Great sushi!  It's fresh and tastes delicious!  I normally frequent RA Sushi but I could no longer deal with the over packed, over priced food and drinks.  Now the outside of the establishment will fool you; it could use a nice clean up.  The inside is clean, nicely decorated, and quite inviting.  We went for happy hour ($2) wells-can't beat it.  The sushi had pictures (I need pictures) it was reasonably priced for regular price but many was on happy hour!  I always get the \"Viva Las Vegas Rolls\" at RA Sushi and decided to give it a try here...SUPERB! I received more of the roll and cost much less.  I also tried the spicy tuna which was excellent as well.  All I can say is they have a new fan...I will be back again and again.  
The service was really good as well.  I never had to request refills or ask twice for anything."}
{"text":"The firecracker sushi is absolutely delicious! They have amazing service! Great deals during happy hour. Love the fact that they close late. My husband and I one day just happened to be sitting at the bar when the food inspector was checking temperatures in the refrigerators and everything was perfect! :)"}
{"text":"Midnight craving creeps in and the only sushi place in town that were opened. Tried their sushi combo A and sashimi salad."}
{"text":"Just went here for dinner, it was the worst $100 I ever spent.  The first set of salmon shisimi is was great so decided to get a second and I get salmon chunks.  Finish my Pepsi and my son finish his water but not once did the server ask if we would like a refill and got charge 10% gratuity for poor service. Never would go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Word to the wise, the last two times I have been to this place, they have added the tip to the check. Now, I understand if there are 8 or more people in a party but there were 2 people once and 3 people the other time. That alone will prevent me from ever going back there."}
{"text":"I have been here once and I am planning on returning. I hit the place during the lunch hour and from outside, they looked closed. Thank goodness I investigated and found out they were open at 11:30 during the week. 

Warning! I am not a professed sushi genius, I have had mostly inland sushi experiences! With that said, this place was delicious. The fish was tasty and tastefully presented. There were some unique combos on the maki (rolls) menu and the service was perfect."}
{"text":"\"No vaporizers please!\" just a heads up. So this place and I have a interesting history. One time I was there and they had a power outage. And then the entire staff went outside to try and figure out what the problem was. WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING TO THE CUSTOMERS. Now I understand this is a pretty extraordinary situation but WHERE IS YOUR PREPAREDNESS? Why didn't anyone teach these people what to do in this situation. I could have just left without paying since no one spoke to me for 20 minutes while I waited for my check in the dark. But I'm not a thief. I waited. Although there had to be some sort of safety regualtion against that actually happening. They should have addressed the customers first, closed tabs, and evacuated, but they seemed to not really give a shiitake about any of the customers. 

ANOTHER TIME. I waited a full half hour before anyone even asked me if I wanted to order. I was surprised after eating that they weren't going to comp the meal. I mean I would have paid for the drinks, obviously. Anyway they made it a BIT better by taking off 20% from the bill but I was disappointed that was all they were willing to do. I know this may sound like I'm coming off as entitled, but it's just the differences between excellent business and mediocracy. Had they comped 50% or more of the meal, this review might be three.

Oh the food is decent, fairly priced for a sushi place if you go in during happy hour or reverse happy hour, but as is expected their portions are really small."}
{"text":"The outside walls are crumbling, there are remnants of an old sign from whatever the place was before, and inside there are some decorative tiles falling apart. 

The place looks like it survived a nuclear war but the sushi is great and that staff was awesome... 

Best post-apocalyptic sushi ever!"}
{"text":"The fish was mediocre at best. For Nigiri, we ordered salmon, albacore, and fresh water eel. First, they gave us fatty tuna (best guess) instead of albacore. After we complained, they brought the albacore. The eel was quite bland. The salmon bordered on inedible. The rolls were competent, but nothing spectacular. The vegas roll was good, but the rainbow roll was flavorless. 

the squid salad was by far the best thing we had here; in fact, the only thing I would say that was actually good!

the worst things were a tie; our waitress was terrible. there was only one other party in the entire restaurant while we were there, and the waitress was still completely inattentive.

The other half of the tie was the edamame. Someone else got to ours first; a member of my party found a maggot in her edamame! This is where the wait staff fell apart. They didn't even apologize, and didn't take it away. I had to get up and carry the edamame dishes up to the sushi bar so they wouldn't be sitting on our table! They took the edamame off the bill, but that was it.

we should have left right then, but I had heard such good things about this place, I really wanted to try the fish. what a waste of time. Needless to say, I will never again be patronizing this joint."}
{"text":"The reason I am leaving 3 stars is because they are in major need of renovations both inside and out. Their outside appearance is not at all appealing. Heaven forbid you need to use the restroom, you'll have nightmares. I seriously hold it until I get home, which by the way is a 15 minute drive. Now to get to the good stuff, their food is amazing!!! I am not one for sushi but all my friends and family love everything they have ordered from here sushi wise. I always order their ramen and they gyoza!! Both are fantastic!!! My friends and my family continue coming here because their food is great and their prices are fair. The one thing I did notice on my most recent visit is that they do add automatic gratuity now, which by the way was not even mentioned to us as we paid, and if if wasn't for one of my friends actually paying attention to their bill the waitress would have received an extra 25% tip on top of the 18% automatically charged. That honestly really annoyed myself and my companions because we all almost left way more extra tip. I don't mind places automatically including the gratuity, however we should be told so that we are aware of how much additional tip is needed so we don't over pay. Because of this I only left enough extra to get them to 20%. Some in my party who would have definitely tipped more than 18% left just the 18% since they felt wronged about not being told. It was very sneaky, not at all professional. Oh I should mention we were a party of 5 so not large and in small fine print on their menu it does state everybody will be charged automatic gratuity so doesn't matter how big or small your party is. I have been to other places that do this but I have always been made aware at the very beginning of the meal about their practices. Overall the appearance might scare you away but their food is truly great. I will continue to dine here as long as their quality of food meets my standards."}
{"text":"This place was nice! Kinda tucked away but definitely good. The happy hour menu isn't bad at all and in my book they get a lot of props for having creative rolls that actually taste good. 

Good Service. 

Nice Ambiance. 

Its all good!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting in this restaurant and it's my first time. The service is extremely slow and it gets better. I'm a lover of noodles, etc .
I ordered Ramen Noodles with vege and I was disturbed and shocked they served me packaged ramen noodles, you know the kind you make at home.
It was pathetic!! 
The Sushi worker saw my face expression of disgust and we even asked him if it was packaged and he said YES...WOW
The worker took it off my bill and I expressed what happened.
I will not return!!!"}
{"text":"Do not go!!!!!! Please read !!!!!!!
Waste of $$$ and Time!!! 

First- the server seemed nice and helpful but NEVR retuned until the water boy had to go get her! 
2nd the food took over 45min 
3rd the server dropped the sushi tray on the table and walked away never saying which one was which! Then we where confused what was just left on the table but knew she would never return!
4th the order was Messed up on the bill no happy hour prices which she said would be and added random things. 
5th when we told the server about the incorrect orders on the bill/$ the host said!!!((((well u eat it)))) we where so mad but new.... I was not about to argue and have to wait another 20 min for a *Manger* to get back! 

Do not go!!!! 
6th ugly nasty/the restrooms look like a cheap gas station smelled and the place was falling apart!!!!!"}
{"text":"went to eat there last year for my birthday. LOVED the food and the atmosphere was great. My fiance loved the egg rolls."}
{"text":"best late night sushi soooo bomb and awesome happy hour deals too! definitely a go to place if you are looking for great drinks and awesome sushi! my new fav late night place for sure."}
{"text":"Please look else for sushi. Place is nasty. Salmon is really old and Mushy. The sushi looked like it was made by amateurs. Service placed gratuity on our bill for 2 people. I don't think he thought we were going to notice and was trying to get more of a tip. Watch out for them"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and always love it! The specials are great, the atmosphere is killer and the service is very good!"}
{"text":"The food is great here and i'd love to leave 5 stars, but honestly every visit has left me upset with slow service and occasionally feeling completely ignored."}
{"text":"I go here a lot. Well...used to. Service gets worse and worse. Food isn't as good as it once was. Happy hour is amazing though!"}
{"text":"I come here often since its right in my neighborhood. Low key atmosphere, servers are nice although service can be too slow at times. Decent sushi. I tend to go between the hours of 6-10 so I can get half off on certain menu items. I do have one suggestion.... dont try the calamari. They're more like calamari sticks and not rings. But they weren't tasty at all."}
{"text":"Love this place pretty decent sushi for a good price, I love that they have happy hour and reverse happy hour. They're even open till 2am for when I'm craving sushi for a midnight meal:)
Only reason I gave it 4stars is that the service is slow sometimes"}
{"text":"I went here last night with my sister, Tina N. (who also reviewed this place) and our friend Heather. Honestly, the place was wonderful. The atmosphere was very laid back and relaxing - no loud music, very good for conversation without needing to shout to be heard. The waitress was prompt and kept on top of our drinks.
We were there for the Happy Hour, which is an amazing deal and it is all fresh and absolutely tender and delicious. 
I recommend the Little Mermaid roll for those who like a little bit of a kick and a crunch, and also the Plum Kiss mixed drink if you want something a little sweet.
Overall - very clean, very delicious and is now my go-to place for Sushi in DownTown Mesa.

Also, there was no gratuity added to our bill. So I really don't know what the other reviews meant by that."}
{"text":"We love saketini sushi! Its open late, and has a nice atmosphere. The rolls are unique and flavorful."}
{"text":"Ummmm.... yummy. Happy to find a little bit of korean food here... :9

I ordered the korean rice cakes, and sake bomb!! 

Im so happy they are open late!

Service was excellent!! :)"}
{"text":"My hubby and I love this place. We drive down from north phoenix (Dunlap & I-17) for their sushi. We just cannot find a place in PHX that has sushi as good as Saketini. Sushi is always fresh, waitresses are always attentive, and we have NEVER had an extra gratuity added to our bill- and we went there for Valentine's.
We recommend the Signature roll. Happy hour and reverse happy hour are great too."}
{"text":"I've only visited once, but I had a great experience! The waiter was friendly and the food came out a minute or two after we ordered it. It seems like a great late night spot to grab sushi and drinks. 

I think the price is a bit much for sushi during normal hours, but I will be back again for their happy hour specials."}
{"text":"a very good place if u just wanna chill, the atmosphere has a calm and relaxing mood to it.  the food is good, though the wait is a little long, but its well worth it.  the bar area is cheap, and the workers are very friendly and easy to talk with.  highly recommend everyone to try it.  also a very good place for lunch and its awesome that the place is open till 2 everyday and the sushi bar is also open till than.  So for those of you who crave for some sushi at 1 am Sake Tini is the spot to go."}
{"text":"No Frills Sushi.
   Saketini is the place to go for good inexpensive (not cheap) sushi. It is a bit of a dive but I'd rather pay for good food not decor. There are specials all day long but our favorite time is dinner for the half price sushi rolls. They have a selection of ten full size rolls for $4.50. The Blonde and I can enjoy a filling meal for under $30. Our personal favorites are the Idaho, the Cinderella and the December 24th. We often add a Vegas or a Rainbow Roll, both of which are not on the happy hour list.
   Our group of 16 people this night (normal dining for us is 2 to 4 people) was very diverse, from children the had never had sushi, a couple people that don't care for sushi, and an U.S. Air Force member that had previously been stationed on Okinawa. They created a large rectangular table arrangement for us so we could converse with everyone. The staff was very helpful answering all questions, keeping water glasses full, finding non-spicy, non-sushi items on the menu for the finicky ones, supplying chopsticks with helpers for the less dexterous ones, and meeting the last second requests for extras.
   Overall, everyone was pleased with the experience. Our Air Force member complimented the quality of the sushi and ultra-finicky Grandma even enjoyed the tempura shrimp and egg rolls.
The Ramen bowls were large and had a nice presentation of fresh vegetable on top. The Blonde and I shared 4 rolls, each was very flavorful and the fish on top of the Rainbow Roll was thinly sliced and very tasty. These sushi rolls are well made and stand up to my heavy handed use of chopsticks. The entire meal was nicely presented as it should be since sushi is edible art.
   This is a hidden gem. They are open until 2 AM making it an ideal spot for a late bite to eat. It is rarely busy enough to require a long wait for a table, even at dinner time.

Warm Fuzzies (the good stuff)
-Half price sushi happy hour.
-Open late.
-Daily happy hour specials at the bar.
-Well done Sushi rolls and Nigri.
-Quiet place for couples.
-Pleasant, helpful staff.

Cold Baldies (the not so good stuff)
-Full bar but the selection is not huge.
-Looks like a bit of a dive.
-Needs a website."}
{"text":"Sushi is decent and so are the prices.  The staff really make this place. All the servers are excellent.  It's open until 2 am which is also a major plus. If sushi is not your thing the ofer plenty of alternatives which are pretty good.  There's also a private room available for parties which is a blast to rent out and not too pricey.  I'll continue to stop by here every week."}
{"text":"This is a great place to enjoy some sushi or a have a few drinks without having to endure the plasticity or prices of the 'Dale. It's refreshing to discover that everyone there is very friendly, upbeat and polite. 

The dining areas have very cool elevation changes and lots of glass surrounding the seating-- it has a really cool feel. There is a full bar where you can sit and watch  one of the widescreens with a Kirin draft- and of course the sushi bar itsself, looking all sleek and enticing.

The food is fantastic- the Rainbow / Vegas Roll's somehow whip anything I've had in Tempe or Scottsdale. Possibly a personal preference, but very good, nontheless.

Overall, Saketini should be an old favorite- by this time next month. Comfortable, cool, and reasonably priced-- with awesome drink specials and a friendly staff. I'm sooo there."}
{"text":"Although it's not in the nicest area, it's still a great place - love the ambiance and the food is wonderful! Sushi all around is great, but try the chicken katsu if you're not in a sushi mood. The lounge area is where I always sit."}
{"text":"I love this place, and their happy hour is great. The staff is really friendly too. I used to be a regular before moving far away and the staff would place my \"usual order\" right after walking in the door, so I didn't have to wait for my sushi. I wish I lived closer so I could go all the time!"}
{"text":"I had poked my head in once again because I just can't resist their salmon. The staff now wears uniforms and service is much better! Glad to see things are looking up a bit."}
{"text":"Couvi is waiting on us tonight and we're having a great time. The good is delicious!  The service is awesome!  Good choice for sister/mom hang out."}
{"text":"Went here for a late night sushi craving and ordered tuna,yellowtail and salmon sashimi,  red dragon, WTH, cherry blossom and the rattle snake rolls.  

The sashimi was good,  our yellowtail slices where small and thin compared the big thick cuts of salmon and tuna.  

All the rolls were very good,  slices could have been sliced a tad bit thinner,   all the cuts were about an inch thick.  Definitely not bit size pieces but it sure didn't fall apart.
 
The food overall I would have to give it a 4 star. 

 The reason it got demoted to 3 stars is due to the fact that the bill came out with gratuity of $17 on a bill of $95 before tax.  I understand the need for yours automatic gratuity charge and it is usually used for parties of 6 or more...But it was only a party of 2!!!!"}
{"text":"I eat here too much! They have great drink specials and the happy hour foodies are yummy! The rolls are the best I have had so far in the Valley, I don't get out much:) The service is so-so but over all a great place!"}
{"text":"I want to give Saketini a better review, because I've happily been eating here for years. But they've done me dirty a few times recently, so I can't. 

The last 2 occasions the blonde female bartender auto-gratuity'd our bill... on a 2-top? We were weekly regulars until this dishonesty happened... twice. I guess if what you want is an 18% tip I'll give it to you, but generally ya'll deserve a bit more for the attentive and friendly service. Ultimately I feel like you're trying to swindle me into not realizing the tip is built into the bill and have me still tip you on top of that. i glanced at other reviews before posting and noticed this is a common theme so I don't feel wrong in my accusations. Also, I have recently worked in the restaurant industry, and had for about 8 years, and I seem to remember that all restaurants in AZ did away with auto-gratuity back in 2013. Seems a little fishy. 

So, aside from this bullshit, I'll give an honest review of the food. They make some delicious plates. 

They open at 3pm, and run 3 different happy hour specials. I liked to go at 5:30 to take advantage of the special that ends at 6 and the new one that starts. The one that starts at 6 has some of my favorite rolls (Little Mermaid, December 24, Idaho, Cinderella, Fire, Doggy Bag, Bronze Medal .. IN THAT ORDER!). I only ever order Mermaid & December recently but the others I listed will also satisfy your Americanized sushi hunger. 

Titanic is my absolute favorite roll. I'm going to update this review when I can recall what fish is on it, but it's ginormous and topped with fresh yummy seafood. No extra distracting sauces, and you'll struggle to pop a whole piece in your mouth. 

Mondays are 5$ Sake-Bombers with your choice of a giant Sapporo or Kirin! Normally 8$ so Monday is a good time."}
{"text":"Best place for sushi! They have a happy hour from 6-10 and then a reverse at 10-1. They also have daily specials for drinks depending on the day of the week."}
{"text":"I love that this place has top seafood plates and choices. The services is hit and miss but once i went in with three friends and we sat at the sushi bar and they saw we weren't getting service they grabbed our order right away. Happy hour is good and drinks aren't expensive anyhow so drinkers celebrate! Cherry roll (i do it without sauce), octopus, anything with their eels, i love the quality of salmon as well. The best part is that FOOD IS SERVED TILL 2AM!!"}
{"text":"This place looks like it's closed from the outside. It's kinda sketchy looking.
The service was okay. But why are the girls working there almost half naked?! It's kinda gross trying to eat sushi when the waitresses shorts look like UNDERWEAR. It's disgusting.
Our food came out quick. 
I had the chicken teriyaki and for it being $13 I expected it to be an amazing tasting plate. It lacked a lot of flavor and the serving was small. We also had the Vegas roll which was so good! 
If I do come back it will definitely be only for the Vegas roll. 
Oh and beware that if you do want extra sauce you will get charged 25 cents which is dumb for the little amount that you get."}
{"text":"I used to really love this place and came often and would have given 4 stars. I forgave the horribly unkempt entrance that is liken a Van Buren back alley because they had terrific food and drink specials all the time. But unfortunately all good things must come to an end and this place is no exception.The quality of sushi has taken a nose dive, and the service is borderline abusive. On our last visit I was going to speak to the manager but realized she was too busy giving a server a back rub at the sushi counter. Shame on you Sakitini."}
{"text":"I went to this place the other night with a friend because it was open late. We ordered a sashimi platter to share along with their mermaid, spicy tuna and signature rolls. The sushi was not bad- definitely could have been more fresh but overall good. 
However when the check came we were not impressed at the 20% gratuity automatically added to our bill. We were a party of TWO, so it did not seem to me necessary or appropriate. Usually gratuity is only tacked on to the bill with a group of 4 or more. So it was almost a bit of a slap in the face as if to say we were not trusted to tip enough. Besides the fact that tips should be based on SERVICE and the amount should be left for the CUSTOMER to decide. As a person who usually tips well, it left a bad taste in my mouth. The food at Sakatini is too mediocre to overshadow their callousness with the gratuity. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Jasmine is the best! Love my bartender and love this place! Pictures for all the specialty rolls, amazing happy hour deals, the WTH roll is my favorite and the wings and nomnomnominal! Also try the plum kiss, it's refreshing yet strong."}
{"text":"Uhmm YUM!

Love the sushi here...Staff is always friendly and always check on you. I fell in love with the Fire roll! Cant go wrong when it's happy hour :)

Obsessed with the mermaid rolls..delicious but I'm always a huge fan when it comes to anything deep fried."}
{"text":"Years later, I dock points for how ghetto it has become and the lack of any kind of management staff on site. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place has decent sushi, nothing to drive far for but their happy hour is great and for some reason I love there chicken wings."}
{"text":"Where else are you going to get sushi at 1am, and good sushi for that matter?  Wonderful food, staff, atmosphere, everything! With lots of variety in both the food and drink selection I love this place and visit frequently."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the best time to go here.  Ohh the Squid salad is top notch.  
Happy hour is 5-6:30PM and all day on Tuesday or all night, I forgot.  I'm going to happy hour in less than 15 minutes.  Also they don't consider Fat Tire a domestic beer when in fact it is made in CO, that's why I didn't give then 5/5 stars."}
{"text":"We come here often. Always get the Cinderella and Little Mermaid roll from happy hour menu. Bomb :)"}
{"text":"This place is cool. The atmosphere is fun and contemporary and feels great. There is no patio for smokers or those who want to eat outside.
    On a great note the sushi rolls are very creative and by far the coolest selection I've seen. Also, they are made well and taste great. 
   On a downside the restaurant is a little expensive, but I've never been able to come in during their happy hour. Also, the service is bad. I can never really get a straight answer about things on the menu and I never feel like the waitresses care about my being there and helping pay their salary. 
   Other than the spotty service and the high prices this place is fun and would be a good \"date night\" for many couples."}
{"text":"I love this place however,  I called today before 8 o'clock and asked what time reverse happy hour began. The guy on the phone told me at 10 o'clock.  I said great.  Then I asked what specials they had currently.  He said yes and that the sushi was currently half off and that it wasn't limited to just the 13 rolls on the reverse happy hour menu.  I then asked to speak with the manager and the manager want really helpful.  She took $2 off the bill.  Had the guy on the phone communicated clearly, we would have come after 10pm.  Guess we will have to stick with Teharu."}
{"text":"Love this  Delicious Sushi Bar! A great place for reverse happy and happy hour specials.Great rolls that arent as common. The place is warm and friendly, service it good as well. I have yet to have a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Wow. I have not had such a tailored experience in a long time. ISAAC realized I was in a rush and quickly got me my drink. I ordered only a couple drinks and nigiri, all off of the reverse happy hour menu, but that did not affect Isaac's service. He was so gracious. Need more like him!"}
{"text":"Over all a bit too busy and hip for me.
Service was a bit slow, but the sushi was 
well prepared, delicious and well presented.
They did serve me Masago instead of Tobiko,
and I did notice.  But I am giving them 4 of 5 anyway.
Yes, it was that delicious."}
{"text":"One of our go to places for inexpensive sushi.   They have great service and a wonderful happy hour.   They have a bar, sushi bar, and table seeting.

We usually go early when it is dead quite and we have the place all to ourselves.   We really like it."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Service was great, too. I had 2 rolls and both were delectable!

We had a total of 4 rolls, 1 large sake bomber, and 2 shots and it came to a bit over 30 dollars. This was during reverse happy hour, but that's still pretty good.

Bottom line: I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK! :D"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi place. From the pics it looks like you get only a few pieces for each roll, but in reality you get about 8 pieces per roll. This is the most per roll anywhere. The sushi chef is funny also."}
{"text":"The menu selection is excellent.  The server asked us where we wanted to sit, but sat us somewhere completely different and she was really slow in getting us our check.  But the food was great."}
{"text":"This is what Yelp is for, as I can now fully express my absolute passion for this place.

Now I have been around the block a few times when it comes to sushi and this place is my one of my favorites. The octopus is fresh and cold, the sake is nice and hot and the trance music is sometimes LOUD and somewhat obnoxious. When I think of my fish place, I like to have all three. Events like naked sushi have been known to happen there and in my book that gives a place a character. I might just have to tell someone about it. So here goes:

 Now I have to start somewhere so I will start by giving mad props to the sushi chefs. After all that is what you go there for right? (Maybe naked sushi) These guys get fresh fish in the desert and they make it look GOOD( and keep it smelling good too). The squid looks like it was pulled out of the ocean mint accent and decoration included. The detail of the appearance is a big deal to me when I think raw fish. Now we shan't forget we are in Mesa but this is darn good.

Mostly I sit at the sushi bar and the guys have always been top shelf. They occasionally give you stuff to try, and if they see you on a date they made slide you some fruit with whipped cream on it. I feel like I am really taken care of every time I go there. I have never had a bad meal or a bad experience.  Their drink menu is pretty sweet too if you are into mixed booze. Try the signature drink a \"Sakitini\" :0

I have been here plenty and the service is always swift, sweet and sorta shy. This place is my friend and I's solace at 1am in a Tuesday night for a late night sushi run. For me,  as good as it gets so close to my house and a little better:)"}
{"text":"Awesome recommended when i went in it was noontime but they are delicious I'm going there next time for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food, drinks and specials are phenomenal. The dim lighted seating is very romantic. Very friendly bartenders and waitresses."}
{"text":"Piece of crap restaurant. Rude service. Look at the over grown broken landscape in front. ..broken bricks..they dont give a crap... ...makes u wonder what crap is lurking in the kitchen..."}
{"text":"I just love the way that they operate the restaurant. With that being said, closing time is around 2AM everyday with various types of food and beverages that my friends and I can choose from. 

The drinks are cheap, however sometimes the sashimi isn't fresh and I have to order the new ones. 

Service is friendly and prompt. 

This spot would be my ideal location to hang out with friends. Thumps up for Saketini!"}
{"text":"Love their sushi. My only complaint is that they included the gratuity to my total and I still included a tip. I had to call back to have them correct it. I would have left a $18 tip!! And there was only two to our dinner party."}
{"text":"Tuesday night happy hour till 2am is what keeps bringing me back. $2 wells, small sakes, and draft and bottled beer (including Corona and Blue Moon).  The happy hour menu is pretty substantial, consisting of various sushi rolls, nigiri, and appetizers such as tuna tataki and Hawaiian poke salad.  The Hamachi kama here is also pretty delicious and the large \"Korean\" menu always presents me with something new worth trying.  Hell, I think they're one of the very few places in Phoenix that serves okonomiyaki and ochazuke.  The staff are all very friendly and you can not only sit at the bar or a table, but some lounge chair area dealio near the entrance.  Pretty sweet.  Also, they have any major sports events on the big flatscreen lcds at the bar.  All in all, an uber sweet weekly hangout with great food and even better drink specials.

*edit* The addition of an inexpensive private karaoke room further enforces the five star rating"}
{"text":"Open till 2 am MOST nights. I'll definitely be back to this place! My coworkers and I went looking for sushi after we got off our shift and granted it was a little late, it was the only place to get sushi at 11 pm on a Sunday. But we were not disappointed! Definitely a bang for your buck too"}
{"text":"The sushi is good but the place itself is gross.  Like sticky gross.  Like \"I can't believe I ate raw fish here\" gross.

Also they ran out of iced tea and half the wine that was listed on their crumpled up, gross, sticky menu.  I know.... who orders wine at a sushi place?  I don't know but for some reason my wife and my friend's wife wanted some, ok?"}
{"text":"I do no know how this place is busy. When you first enter the restaurant, you would smell the fishy place. It is a rule of thumb, never eat in a smelly place especial raw items. My friend insisted on me to try their sushi, so i ordered a dragon roll which is my favorite roll. The roll came to me with some mushed elk and salmon on top, literally it was gross. i grabbed a bite to taste, because i was curious about it. I don't know if the chef knows what he is doing or just throwing bunch of stuff in a roll. 
I hate to be critical but when i complained to the server who was extremely nice and told me the manger can't do nothing about it and we have to charge you. I was completely shocked and thanked her for the service but i would never ever come to such place."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. My boyfriend and I have been coming here for years now (about once a week) We usually get sat with Chelsea who is awesome! But we've never had such HORRIBLE SERVICE until tonight! \"Xcari\" or whoever we had tonight was so rude. Commenting on how much food I ate ( I wasn't even finished eating) then was ignoring us the whole time. We had to call over other servers. Mind you, there was only 2 tables including us. Then I find out that with just the two of us, they added 18% gratuity to our bill!! That was ridiculous. 2 people and you add gratuity? Maybe she KNEW she gave terrible service. Whatever the reason was, we will NOT be coming here ever again!"}
{"text":"Since this place opens past midnight, we decided to come here to eat. The rolls were delicious; however the service was very poor. The beef ramen we ordered was too dry, and dumplings were not cooked all the way. After having an unsatisfying dinner, we asked  for the check. 18% of the total amount was already included for the tips -which i don't think they deserve according to their service and food-, and there were just two of us! 18 percent. Right. Now I know why the service was very poor, because the server knew that she would get the tips anyway despite the attitude. I would not come to this place again, ever."}
{"text":"Overly expensive for what they offer.. unless you go during happy hour its not worth it."}
{"text":"It is so cheap and still such good quality sushi, definitely would recommend to everyone. I like the fire cracker jalapeno sushi, it is like a jalapeno popper but better. Also we ordered two things of extra ginger and they didn't charge us any extra!"}
{"text":"It's not the best sushi I've eaten but I'm not very picky about sushi in general-i love it all. With that saying, I enjoyed my meal. I had a Philly roll and shrimp tempura. My waitress was nice and even though they had gotten busy, there was always someone who came by to check on us. My only gripe and this probably has nothing to do with the restaurant itself is how ghetto it was. There was a raucous group inside and a loud, drunk dude shouting at the bar. Mind you this was at 5pm. I walked outside afterwards and some girl was giving some guy a lap dance at the entrance...I don't know maybe they need some security?"}
{"text":"Happy we came!  Great rolls. WTH was my favorite, as it had a little spice/kick to it. 

Everything we had was very good. We started w Monkey Brain salad (slimy texture but avocado, seaweed , and sauces were yummy). We also tried the Playboy roll (come w an empty stomach, as this one is as filling as it is good); the Crazy Boy roll, and one other. All were fresh and prepared for the eye, not just the stomach. 

We will be returning to try more."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their happy hour! The prices were great (we got three appetizers, three special rolls, and wine for ~30). The sushi also tasted really fresh, which can be hard to find at such low prices. 

I was a little confused when they charged extra for wasabi and additional sauces, but overall I really liked this modern sushi spot."}
{"text":"Food was great, service on the other hand was terrible. EXTREMELY rude sushi chefs, openly treats fellow staff terribly. Server was sweet but didn't know much about menu items and took too long to pick up bill and help us. Overall not a good experience at all"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. For some reason every time I go there aren't many people in there but the environment is nice. The Happy Hour deals don't seem like much for me but the Half Off Sushi is decent. There are at least two or three rolls for me there as I do not eat any raw sushi, I only eat the cooked or baked rolls. I like their ideas for rolls and their presentation is nice. They seem to have a good variety for all types of sushi lovers. Some of the rolls are very pricey though so be prepared to possibly spend over $10 on certain rolls."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place isn't busier on the weekdays!!! It's literally happy hour all the time. The food is good and the drink specials are pretty good too. Definitely one of our go-to places when we're on this side of town."}
{"text":"Our experience was good for our first time here.  I was a little skeptical about eating here as they have pigeons hanging out near the front door.  (I hate groups of pigeons, their disgusting)...  

The service was great. Very prompt with water and drinks.  Took our orders when we were ready.  Good came fast.  The quality of the food was decent.  It's what you expect for normal sushi place.  We sat at a table, but they do have bar seating.   

There was plenty of seating inside.  It looks like this place was originally a fancy eatery if some kind.  Can't remember what was originally there? 

I would go back.  There are a couple different happy hour menus for different times of the day."}
{"text":"In our opinion this is the best place for sushi in the valley. We go once a week. The food, the service, and chef s are amazing! The prices are fantastic!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy the ramen dishes here. Can't rate the other food because we pretty much stick to the chicken ramen. On the plus side, their customer service is exceptional. On the downside it's a bit run-down, quite noticeably so in the restrooms."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but as far as that experience goes..it was amazing. We got the Rattlesnake, Little mermaid, Cinderella, & edamame. Everything was so so good. Especially for going in with zero expectations..(good sushi in az is just too hard to find) So many creative rolls, an extensive menu and the server was patient and sweet, even though we had a table of 12 + 2 Rowdy kids. $1 well drinks and $2.50 beers. The place plays music, but not too loudly. 
Food is so much better than RA. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Severs are very nice and sexy most of them wear shorts. The sushi was good. The salmons' very fresh!! Undecorated food much. Cut sashimi not right still have red thing on fish. Hello? This is restaurant right? Is not sushi buffet? So I used to work at the sushi restaurant more than 2 years. They should make it worth the value."}
{"text":"Really like this place! We've gone a few times and each time the service has been great and the food has been yummy! We order 2 rolls each off of the happy hour menu and it's usually around $20 which is great for the budget"}
{"text":"Loved this place. It wasn't very busy when we arrived which made me wonder a little bit. But we were pleasantly surprised. The sushi was very fresh, the service was excellent, and the prices were extremely affordable. We will be going back. My daughter loved the chopsticks they put together for her to help her pick up her food."}
{"text":"First time here. Was a little concerned upon entry, with their picture book menu, but the sushi is freaking great. Went with a regular spicy maki, and a fire roll. Upon delivery I realized the fire had avocados in it. I'm not allergic, but my stomach HATES them. The waitress sensed my disdain after she witnessed me double checking the menu. She said it would be no problem to replace it, and the chef didn't even seem mad. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The sushi was great, fresh, with a healthy portion of fish on each piece.  The wait staff was inexperienced, but yet eager. Music was a little too loud for my taste...makes it hard to carry on a conversation without raising your voice.  The Uni was exceptional."}
{"text":"Great service. Amazing sushi! They make fresh sushi, and they bring it out FAST."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour this time, and upped my stars to five! Happy hour is, for sure, the time to visit!

Another best friend in town, and we hit the place about 5:30 on Friday night (happy hours are 4-6). She got a Saketini which is the signature drink. I had a sip and it was very tasty!

We also got two apps: Gyoza and Edamame. Both perfect. 

For our sushi, we went with: Spicy Tuna, Avocado, a Salmon, and a Crunch Roll. All were very good. Plenty of food for the two of us to come out full!

Service once again was stellar. Water stayed full and our waitress answered my questions well about just what makes the Spicy Tuna spicy!

Total bill was just over $28 with tip. Love it!"}
{"text":"Tuesdays are all night happy hours (when one ends, the reverse begins), and Mondays and Thursdays after 6:30 they have a collection of 1/2 off rolls.

Can't speak too much for the drink specials because I always get their signature saketini, which is made with absolut and some green tea liqeuor. I highly recommend this drink because it's smooth, slightly sweet, and has that nice green tea flavor I just love.

We're pretty boring when it comes to rolls--got the crispy california, the shrimp tempura and the firecracker, which was a jumbo jalepeno popper with spicy crab in it. Oh man, it was all glorious. I've had the spicy tuna there also, and the dragon. It's all good to me.

They always have some crazy creation on the sushi board and the staff is always friendly. You're better off sitting at the bar--we go for games--as it seems the servers are more attentive there (or at least they're always back there doing stuff).

Try it, and keep a business alive."}
{"text":"Food was okay but beware of the \"auto-tip\" scam, even on a party of 2!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is really really good, and the reverse happy hour is so great! However, the bartender is the worst! She has ignored me every time I've been there...I kept hoping it would get better but it only got worse. You will sit there for at least 15 minutes before she will bother to come over. One time my fiancé asked her for a beer as she walked by and she said \"just a minute\" extremely sarcastically to him. We have seriously sat there every time we have been there and watched her flirt with some guys at the bar while we just sat there needing service. Also, she's pretty vulgar too, several f bombs have been dropped. Do not bring your parents to the bar!! I can guarantee she has never been a bartender before. I am really hoping management gets a clue and cans her ASAP so we can not leave that place angry next time. I wish I could say I won't go back but the sush is so good that we may just avoid the bar area, plus it's literally down the road."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi bar, we got here around 9:00 p.m. on a Sunday and the place was empty by the time we headed out the place had filled up pretty good. We ordered some nigiri maguro, salmon, yellowtail, and a signature roll. All the sushi was good as was the service. Saketini's atmosphere is pretty casual and laid back, TV's had baseball games on.
Overall, I would go back to Saketini next time I'm in Mesa, AZ and am looking for Sushi."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting and ridiculously overpriced! Decided to give this place a shot after some co-workers raved about it--I don't know what they were thinking, it was horrible! The wait staff was nice but the food was revolting! Never had calamari that tasted like deep fried a rubber chew toy, but I guess there's a first time for everything. Needless to say, I wouldn't go back if you paid me. Seriously, don't waste your time with this place!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here all the time and have always had good experiences. The food is great, wait staff is super friendly and helpful, and they have great specials."}
{"text":"Cheap sake bomb Monday and delicious food!! As a vegetarian I eat the vege tempura and garlic edamame! Would recommend. Nice and quiet usually, but still a blast if you're in a drinking mood. The fire cracker sushi roll is also amazing for a spicy treat(non-vegetarian). Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I convinced my boyfriend to try this place with me after searching for local sushi spots around mesa. he was like \"sushi and karaoke? that doesn't sound too good.\" But we tried it and I was surprised at how clean and modern-looking it was! We've been going for the last six months and every time we have friendly and excellent servers. The sushi is great too--especially when they do their specials! They have sakebomb specials Monday nights I think, and happy hour and reverse happy hour! My favs are the cinderella roll and crunchy cali. always so fresh!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the not so stellar reviews, I was a bit apprehensive about eating here. When my party arrived we were promptly sat and drink orders were taken. We then looked over the huge sushi menu. They have pictures of every single roll they have, which makes it so much easier to order. All of the rolls I ordered were simply amazing! I had spicy tuna, might have been one of the best spicy tuna rolls I have ever had. Also had the Vegas roll...holy hell... Once again.. One of the best Vegas rolls I have ever had. The waitress comped one of my adult libations because she could tell I wasn't a fan of the drink and brought me a new one. Overall the service was amazing and so was the sushi. I hope people read this review and know this place is legit."}
{"text":"My next favorite Sushi bar in the valley. Service can be slow, but the Sushi chefs are always very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"The most uncomfortable seating in the world, but I don't even care. We come here all the time for happy hour and can usually get 4 rolls for under $20 (before tip).Super yummy and big rolls and they're ready super quickly, this is our go to sushi spot."}
{"text":"Service is always great every time so far, recommend this place if you love happy hour."}
{"text":"The food is ok but there are a few good things about this place. We go here all the time.

1. It's open late so you can definitely get some great food at night. And there is also a reverse happy hour.
2. The waitress allowed a party of 24 to get separate checks. That was really helpful. She made sure she wrote our names down and was a pretty good server.
3. There's also a karaoke room. You can reserve it for a group and it's $5 per person
4. The decor is pretty nice too and there are TVs that show sports.

The main thing about the food is that it's ok but at a high price. Definitely had better at a lower price. And the ramen, don't bother getting it. It tastes like store bought package ramen in spicy watered down soup. I had REAL Japanese Ramen, and the one here doesn't compare.

Just make sure you come during regular happy hour for good prices. If you come late at night, there's reverse happy hour which gives you ok prices on a few items."}
{"text":"Reigning duchess speaking!  My coworkers and I visit this place almost every Saturday. This is our go to spot after work since the food is alright, and they close late. (Call around 1 am though cos even if they close later than that the kitchen might close earlier if they're not busy). They have a full bar, great happy hour prices and unbeatable daily specials. Why not 5 stars though? Because the food is not spectacular. It's never bad though. Great place for drinking with friends. Servers are all cute and friendly. The manager is always behind the sushi bar, meticulously looking at everything. I was just here yesterday, and the week before that and most likely next week...so see you there!"}
{"text":"Overall, I haven't noticed any distinguishing features, but I sure do love its atmosphere and food. The atmosphere is pretty casual and calm, and it's always clean. There is indoor seating ranging from bar, sushi bar, to normal sit-down tables. I've been here several times during the weekday evening. It hasn't been busy so I have always been seated immediately and received fast service. This place has such a wide variety of sushi! I am always impressed by the available options. Price is pretty average for sushi and serving size is pretty standard as well. Only downside to this restaurant is that I feel the Japanese food could be more authentic."}
{"text":"It's a cool concept that you can get sushi until 2am and they serve alcohol until that time as well. However I felt like their menu was virtually all the same just mixed up in a different way, it seemed to me it was all shrimp, crab, avocado, cream cheese, cucumber, sprouts, eel sauce, and then a few variations were thrown in of course and then they were just mixed around. Don't get me wrong I love all of those combinations but there wasn't really a large variety of fish - so if you're a beginner to sushi this is the place to go, really wish I would've known about this when I first started eating it."}
{"text":"Gotta love a place that has 2 happy hours... even if their happy hour menu is a bit limited.  I bet this would be a great place to drink. Unfortunately, I was pregnant when I discovered it and now, I have a newborn so I'm still not drinking. haha

That said, the sushi and udon are pretty tasty and I love that they're open late-night.  Everyone that I've taken has liked it and I think it would be a good date night spot, as well.  

See ya there!"}
{"text":"We usually like this place for late dinner. But tonight was kinda disappointed. First of all, the girl who seated us seems a little bit impatient. There was only like one or two table sitting there when we got in. And she seated me and my husband in a very small table. We just switched to a bigger table ourselves. Food was ok. Our server was good at most of the time. But later on he just kinda rush to take off the plate while we still working on it. Same thing for the check. We were still eating! Then here comes the worst thing: THEY CHARGE US TIPS FOR US (ONLY 2 people)!!! Are you kidding me? I have never had a restaurant charge tips for only 2 people! We usually tip out 20% after tax. Too bad!"}
{"text":"I love this bar / sushi restaurant. Its open til 2AM most nights (sometimes closes early if there aren't any customers) and usually will make sushi til half past midnight! It's the only good sushi place that I know of open that late. The servers are very friendly and the food is delicious. I had a baked roll called the \"Playboy\" - it was AMAZING!! My new favorite roll."}
{"text":"Hostess was not very personable, but our waitress was great. Atmosphere was more of a sports bar, than a restaurant. Food came out quick, and the rolls were average, however the Alaskan was awesome."}
{"text":"cute little spot that is really close to my place. the decor is very modern...its has an odd mix of sports bar/sushi bar. service was great. the sushi was legit. my roomie and i shared the alaskan, insanity, and little mermaid rolls. the alaskan and little mermaid rolls were very good. the insanity had a little too much immitation crab meat...there was crab within the roll and crab meat sitting on top of the roll. the agedashi tofu was also very good for an appetizer. apparently HH is the time to come here according to previous reviews so i'll definitely have to come back and check that out."}
{"text":"FAVORITE SUSHI RESTAURANT !!! I love this place! It's either happy hour or half of sushi all the time here. Their specialty rolls are amazing, I love the fire and little mermaid. Nigiri is never less than amazing as well. Boba place in the same plaza is amazing as well for dessert."}
{"text":"This place is pretty yummy for people that don't even like sushi too (People like me)! The chefs made the sushi literally within minutes of ordering it, they should work at jimmy johns, yes they were that fast! 
(The chefs= 2.5 stars of the 3 given) 
My waiter, he wasn't as prompt as I'd prefer, but he was such a kind soul. Just a little behind on the basics like filling up our drinks... 
anyway, would recommend if you are looking for a late night sushi!! Still reat atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there for the first time the sushi is excellent ordered the  chicken teriyaki and It was very disappointing very small portion compared to many other places I've been too, 
The other thing is the ambience is very uncomfortable you have employees just standing there watching you eat it seems, wont be going back!!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the sushi here! We came for happy hour at 530 PM on a weekday and I'm pretty sure we were the only ones in the restaurant the whole time we were there.

$5 house wine on HH, sushi was reasonably priced for HH which is 3-6 then at 6 there is half off sushi. So it seems like there's almost always a deal.

My friend and I were very satisfied with our sushi, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Original plan was to come in for reverse happy hour but we ended up there at 9pm. So glad, because they have half price sushi on weekdays from 6-10. We ordered 3 rolls from the half price selection and were totally wowed. We both agreed it was the best sushi either of us have ever had. Very fresh and excellent sauce. Service was top notch, very attentive. Our food came very quickly even though they place was so full that we had to sit at the bar. Can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"I definitely had a very poor experience with this place. The service was good. I ordered a to go order of a dragon roll and thank goodness I didn't order anything else. I only live 4 blocks from this place and when I got home the sushi had fallen apart it was just thrown together there was wasabi all over the place and eel was very chewy. I know this place has gotten great reviews but I think I'll travel a bit further for my sushi next time. I definitely will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been to this restaurant roughly every other month for the past year and a half.  Every single time I have visited, the food is consistent.  The sushi is excellent (not large portions of fish in the rolls), and are extremely cheap. It seems this place always has some great special going (whether it be reverse happy hour, or a daily special).  The beer on tap is great and the selection is quite extensive for a sushi bar.  Service in the past was not the best, in that you could tell the waitresses had too many tables to handle at once, but this has changed noticeably over the past 6-9 months and service is very good.

I recommend this place to anyone who wants some GREAT priced sushi and a laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"This food was seriously disgusting. First of all, I had trouble even finding something appetizing to eat on the menu. We ordered two rolls and I almost threw up while I was eating it. It was gross and not fresh. Didn't taste good. We also order green mussels and it came with a mountain of imitation crab on top of a little mussel. I couldn't believe it. Service was alright. She asked us if we wanted ginger and wasabi... At a sushi restaurant... Kind of a weird, gross atmosphere. Not pleasant. It was a totally disappointing sushi dinner. I just know I will never come back here and I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone. The 3 1/2 star rating is misleading. -__-"}
{"text":"Pluses:
-happy hour is pretty good
-the hours of operation are nice, always great to have a late-night sushi place.

Middle-of-the road:
-service is inconsistent. Generally friendly people with odd wait times for food
-sushi quality is alright for AZ, neither horrible nor outstanding

Cons:
-the condition of the restaurant is surprisingly bad in several areas. A shame, because it used to be decorated very smartly. Lots of 'cracks' are starting to show all over."}
{"text":"Always outstanding sushi. Kind of modern atmosphere yet kind of tore up! However it's my favorite sushi joint!"}
{"text":"Very poor service, we had to practically beg to get things. Employees seemed more interested in talking to each other vs. taking care of their tables.

Sushi wasn't great and had way too much sauce on everything."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing fish, great chicken teriyaki, awesome service, really reasonable prices, beautiful decor. 

If you don't like loud music, don't go here, but even if you don't, its worth it to have the Tuna Nigiri!!"}
{"text":"I've only been to this place once, but we drank sake bombs on a Friday night and got a very good price on them.  They give you enough to do 3-4 sake bombs with one order.  If you're looking for authentic sushi I wouldn't imagine you would want to come here because I did feel like a good amount of their rolls were deep fried or had deep fried things in them.  I personally thought they were really delicious, though.  I would recommend this place for an affordable meal and a few drinks because they always have happy hour specials or late night happy hour specials as well!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Went here around ten on a friday night. They have a great reverse happy hour and I haven't had sushi this good since I was in San Diego! Definitely beat what I expected going in. The bar service could have been a little better (we were the only two at the bar so it shouldn't have been too difficult to pay attention given there were two bartenders) but overall really great! Food was awesome service was ok!"}
{"text":"The sushi was just okay.  I couldn't get past how filthy the place was.  We sat at the bar, and it was such a mess. Not sure how they pass health code."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time having sushi in a couple of years, and WOW was this place worth a try! I had \"Fire\" which I would definitely recommend. Price isn't too expensive and if you go with plenty of friends, Saketini makes for a great place to enjoy happy hour...or reverse happy hour...or half off sushi...ahhh so many great deals!"}
{"text":"Great place for half off sushi , I especially love tempura style sushi and this place is the best with making it . I tried a lot of sushi places and tried the sushi tempura style and it was ether hard , and rubbery . By far the best place for sushi , I tried the bronze metal and the December 24th rolls , excellent . Give this place a try you won't regret it"}
{"text":"On Saturday I ended up doing an interview for this establishment for an assignment for one of my classes. And I have to say, the owner is so down to earth, and the employees were all great. The food was all delicious, and extremely well presented. 
The decorations were really minimalistic but I enjoyed that aspect of it. It's well executed for a fusion of both Asian decorations as well as American. The service was great and the deals are unbeatable in terms of sushi and drinks. 
I will definitely be coming again."}
{"text":"Went for a double date during sushi happy hour. Fun names, lots of cream cheese which is a pro and a con depending on the roll. Service was ok.. good crowd but for the price I'd rather go somewhere else. The Mochi was the best part."}
{"text":"I really love the sushi. It's our regular hot spot for when we want to go eat some. Everything is great from the food to the staff. My only issue is that they don't honor the great prices when you order out. I feel like they are losing business this way. Every time we're too lazy to go out and eat we want to place a take out order. However, when the prices cost double the amount, we typically will shoot for a different place to order take out from. So we don't get food from here as often as we want to. Sad."}
{"text":"I thought I had prepared myself by reading the negative reviews before going, but I was mistaken. Sushi low-grade to average. I ordered 6 things and most of them tasted identical. While on the topic of ordering, we went with a group of 20ish people who all arrived at different times. Drink orders were handled relatively quickly but not refilled as emptied. My friends had pre-reserved for the amount of people we had and they had us in an elevated room with a U-shaped table arrangement which forced more than half the group to face the backs of the others. When the one waiter they gave us took our orders, he expected us to order everything we wanted at once. It's a sushi restaurant and I want a steady trickle of dishes. I didn't order everything at once and then had to wait while he returned to the group 4 times before he'd stop to take another order. Yes we had a big group, but he added an 18% tip onto our bill, which would be fine if he deserved it or if we had more than one server. The Korean kitchen menu is lackluster. Hopefully the quality of food is usually better but the Crown Cali Roll tasted like cat food and neither it nor the Signature roll resembled their menu image. We will not return."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here since they first opened and have never had a bad experience. The staff is always friendly and courteous and the food is always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Went there at 11pm.  Ordered the ramen and it was awful.  Tasted and looked exactly like shin instant ramen. Sushi is good for the price.  Especially happy hour."}
{"text":"I'm up and down on this place. Had you asked me last year id prob give this place 4 stars. And much of the stuff is the same . sushi its self is decent for the price . they almost always have happy hour or some drink special going on so no matter when your stopping by you will get a decent deal. 
My issue come more with the place its self and being from the service industry I am guessing it stems from managment . I will say the staff is friendly and while a lil slow if I watch I tend to see many of the times in there its just understaffed . and 1 server has a bunch of tables so its not their fault. The other issue again servers are very nice but could be trained a bit more on alcohol . being a bartender I want a good cocktail and have questions about their specials and their liquors. And the servers here and even the bsrtender once was not able to answer my question . even simple stuff like ordering a tall rum and coke .. They brought me a short double and charged me for the double. The basic stuff like that needs to be taught .  
The thing that really set me over the edge though lately was noticing a auto grat on our tickets. I totally get wanting to gray tables some times. However auto grating a table of 3 ? Without having any signs in your restaurant that clearly state this is your procedure . that's not okay. And frankly I'm sure works sometimes for your servers . but is kinda a slap in the face to a table of servers who have been very nice to you. We noticed this several times when we came in and asked around and other people noticed it as well. They did not use to do this and we prob missed it once or twice and could be easy not to notice its on there and end up paying more then you meant to. This is just shady ... Again I'm guessing this is not the servers chosing to do this in guessing it is a management thing. Just kinda sad for a place that has so much potetional ."}
{"text":"Who doesn't want to eat sushi in the wee hours of the night/morning? I loooooove that they are open this late. While I was in school, it was hard to find a good sushi joint to eat at after 10pm. They have reverse happy hour too!"}
{"text":"Super tasty place! I routinely come here with friends; there is always some sort of special going on for either rolls, appetizers, or drinks. The rolls have always tasted fresh, and I love the Hello Kitty cocktail. 

Each of the servers and bartenders that have helped me have always been very friendly and helpful.

I admit that the interior could use a little bit of sprucing up, but it has never bothered my dining experience. It's true that there are tennis balls on the bottom of some of the chairs, but I'd rather there be tennis balls instead of hearing that atrocious noise of chairs scraping against the floor because people don't know how to get out of their seat properly."}
{"text":"I don't get what all the hype is about. 

Came on a Monday night in time for happy hour. Arrived around 5:45pm. We were one of the only tables in the entire restaurant. 

The waitresses weren't very helpful. We had to flag them down to order before happy hour ended. The menu is huge, mainly consisting of deep fried or baked items. I'm not a fan of sushi restaurants that aren't real sushi. I had a hard time finding fresh, raw items on the menu. Finally decided on a spicy salmon, spicy tuna, Little Mermaid (shrimp tempura w/spicy crab), Lollipop (white fish, salmon, avocado) and Dynamite (shrimp tempura with baked fish on top with a creamy sauce). They were all OK. I've had better, fresher sushi elsewhere. I won't be back. 

Also, the bathrooms didn't have any toilet paper or paper towels to dry your hands."}
{"text":"\"Worst service everrr.  I don't recommend this fake sushi bar to anyone... \" is what i thought when i went there and they double booked the karaoke room.. i am still sore about that, because they did not offer all 25 of us any compensation at all. I have been there a couple times since, and i have not had a problem."}
{"text":"Ive been meaning to come here and finally made it out Friday night with Daniel!  I consider him the sushi expert, and was finally ready to see what all the hype was about.

We came in Friday night and the place was dead.  I mean not a soul but one guy sitting in the corner.  Where was everyone?  We sat down and the server came right over and gave us our menus and took our drink orders.  They seem to have a decent drink menu here and we both ordered chocotinis.  The drinks came out and they were tasty!  YUM!!  Anyways, we ended up ordering some food, and whatever we did end up eating was delicous!  (Daniel the expert did the ordering knowing that I am new to this.  We did a few different things and they were delicious.)

Place is cute and well decorated.  Being a novice to this, I was happy with the taste and display of the food that we ate.  I really had a good time here.  As the night went on, we did end up seeing more people come into the resturant,  but that wasn't for a while.

Service was great, and overall I had a good experience.  Will return in the future."}
{"text":"I actually love this place and that it is open late but it's always bugged me that they seem to refuse to maintain the building. 

For the last few years the men's sink is broke, the wall out front is falling apart, thier stick on tiles are falling off the wall  and missing where you eat by the bar. 

Add in that when the power went out the emergency lights had not been maintained or serviced, out of curiosity I've checked for the last two years on the one on the men's room.. It has never worked and I've check it out of boredom when ever I'm here. 

Seriously, if you can't maintain this place with the obvious items that are staring you in the face, it makes me ask are you cutting corners elsewhere in places that matter? 

It's disappointing at best.

 I'll continue being a patron  just hoping the corner cutting doesn't ever result in me getting sick."}
{"text":"Possibly some of the best sushi I've ever had.  Go on a Sunday afternoon and sit at the bar.  The Sushi chef gave us free rolls and drinks.  If he asks if you like spicy, and you say yes, expect really really spicy.  Great place.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"We mainly come here for karaoke but the sushi I've had is not that bad

The karaoke is average the machine could be a bit better and they placed it weirdly outside the room so you have to point it awkwardly till the number spits out. They also seem to charge a $20 flat rate with an added 18% gratuity no matter what.

We got the cherry blossom roll (they mistakenly label it as maki) packed with tuna and salmon. Was quite crudely made but I'm willing to let it slide as we ordered at 1:29 am and they still made it for us even though it was cutting it close.

The fish quality could be better but I'm giving it a pass because it is Arizona (far from the sea, less seafood consumption)

Quite pricey though 12.99 for a semi-decent product
Will definitely keep location in mind where I move in the future in accordance to seafood.... Arizona is not it"}
{"text":"Nothing sticks out about Saketini that makes it great, so I'm not sure why the average rating is so high.

My friend and I got there on a Monday night around 5:45. The place was dark and practically empty. I started getting panicky that we would not get our orders in before happy hour ended at 6. The server came and brought us water at 5:50 and then didn't come back until right before 6. We made happy hour, but barely. I don't know why the server was taking her time - there was one other table so it's not like it was busy. Hate when people make me nervous.

Anyway, to the rolls. They have a huge list of specialty rolls, but 95 percent of them are deep-fried, baked, stuffed with cheap imitation crab or cali rolls. Only a few had fresh fish in them. So far, not impressed. 

We ordered the spicy salmon and tuna, which were big, chunky and quite spicy. I was happy with these. I ordered a Dbacks specialty roll which was tasty but not amazing. My friend and I shared the Mermaid, which was half price after 6:30, and that was OK. Again, nothing to write home about. Specialty rolls range from $8-12, but they're stuffed with the cheap stuff, so I don't know if they're worth it.

In the end, we had 5 rolls, no drinks and the bill came out to $35, which, if the quality was superb, I would not have had a problem with. I don't think I'd go back, it just wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Saketini opened not too long ago, so they're still having grand opening specials.  Get 'em while they're hot!

I haven't had their food yet, but I have partaked in their fantastic drink specials.  They have $2 well drinks for happy hour.  Woo hoo! Plus they have a reverse happy hour too, which scores them another star.  Any place that offers late night drink and food specials is alright in my book.  Once I try the food, I'll be back and I'll update the review."}
{"text":"Be cautious going here! They threw on a tip just because our bill was large. Party of 4 and they want to throw an auto gratuity on our bill even after providing poor service.  The male server visited us twice on his own and ever other time we had to waive the dumbass down."}
{"text":"Saketini has many fond memories for me; I have been coming in as a regular now for almost four years and will continue to keep coming back despite the fact that it has steadily declined since I started going. 

So what works at Saketini? Well, their happy hour menu is to die for. They have half-price sushi and rotating drink special EVERY night. They also have reverse happy hour Mon-Thurs, which is fantastic. Their menu is extensive and has a picture book companion, which works out really well when I bring friends who don't partake in sushi often. 

I will say that I only partake in the veggie sushi and mock crab, but even with this limitation I always have enough to eat and they are very good about making certain rolls veggie for me. My favorite roll is the Fire Roll, which is mock crab, avocado and sour cream that is fried and then doused with spicy mayo. Again, it used to be better when I first started coming, but it's still worth the half-price. 

Now what doesn't work? I would not pay full price for any of the items I get, except maybe the Fire Roll. I almost exclusively only go during Happy Hour or Reverse Happy Hour. The service is usually terrible unless it is super slow; they are almost always understaffed. My group was seated on the little \"banquet room\" once and the music was horrendously loud. We asked at least ten times to have it turned down before they did so. TEN. TIMES. 

Not in a rush? Okay with mediocre service? Want cheap sushi/drinks but only at a certain time? Then Saketini is the place for you."}
{"text":"This place is great. The happy hour is a great deal. The dinner salads are only $3 and big and the ginger dressing was yummy. I got the Alaska roll and the doggy bag roll and shared with my 2 year old. The rolls are fat and so so good."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great happy hour/reverse happy hours specials. Try the sashimi salad, the dressing is wonderful! 

Monday night they have a sake bomber special for $5. They are also open until 2am and serve food up 'til !:30am, which is convenient for people who work later in the night."}
{"text":"It is horrible to think this used to be one of our favorite places and now run by young college kids who do not have much respect. We love the sushi but the service just is not there. 

The fact that we had gratuity added to our bill already for only a two person check is mind blowing. When asked about it, she stumbled to find the words and ended with because it was a holiday(Valentine's Day) and she wanted to make sure she got her tips.... really?! She also stated she was new and this is just how she does it... again really?!

Then when called the next day to ask about it with a manager we are told that a manager is not available and no supervisor either. Not until Friday and we can cal back then... do I say it again really?! So your to tell me no person other than the workers who seem to now be ripping people off are there to speak to me?! 

I again love the sushi and have driven all the way from the back of Gilbert to specifically go to Saketini because we have been going since they opened. Now my feeling is that I will feel more secure maybe going some where else since they don't seem to care either!"}
{"text":"One word......YUMMY!!!!

Love the whole look and feel of this place. You must try the Titanic Roll. It is to die for. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Best sushi place! Definitely my go-to! 6pm to 10pm is half off sushi and my favorite is the fire! So yummy and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour. Very good sushi for a very good price. Got a couple different apps as well."}
{"text":"Great place for big groups! I use to come here slot for birthday parties and sometimes just to grab so sushi.!

Like any other sushi restaurant they have a variety of different types of sushi. That are all really good. They have happy hour during the day and reverse happy hour around 10pm to close."}
{"text":"Good food but the service is horrible! Also word to the wise... don't let your waitresses look like whores! Your ass cheeks hanging out of your shorts is fucking nasty! Grow up and stop whispering about customers like you are 12! I have been here about 5 times hoping the service gets better but it doesn't.  It is horrible every time. The wait to even be acknowledged is over 5 minutes.  This time was over 10 minutes. Yes, I time it because I am tired of shitty service!"}
{"text":"I have visited this place several times in the past. They have a decent happy hour and daily specials. But after my last visit, I will never be back! 

A couple of friends and I stopped in last night for some late night happy hour sushi and drinks. The service in the past has usually not been the best. However, this time our server, Tony, was actually on point.

I ordered my usual Fire Cracker dish and a friend ordered the chicken gizzards. His food was okay but he literally pulled out about half a cup of slivered garlic pieces. WAY TOO MUCH GARLIC!! Mine tasted fine as usual so not too bad there. Our bills were a reasonable price for all we got. So we left fairly happy with our experience. 

The reason I am giving this place only 1 star is because of the torture I went through after getting home from dinner. I got the worst food poisoning I have ever had to deal with in my life. I had to make a trip to urgent care this morning after being glued to the toilet all night! 

Thanks a lot Saketini!! I won't forget this experience for quite some time."}
{"text":"YAY for another good find!!! 

Saketini has great service, wonderful chill atmosphere and a large food/drink menu. They have seating at the sushi bar, seating at the regular bar and then also table seating. They have daily deals..yesterday (Monday) was 1/2 off sake bombers..can i get a WHOOP WHOOP?!?

They have an extensive sushi menu with both cooked and raw sushi.  We tried the Firecracker and they even let us add avocado into it. It was baked to perfection and we absolutely loved them. If you're not a huge raw sushi fan there are multiple options that consist of cooked sushi and whoever is serving you will be more than happy to suggest what you might like best. They also have a full non-sushi menu as well.  Shrimp tempura and edamame were delicious as well.

Four rounds of sake and three plates all for $37 duckets!

Check Saketini out !. Good food, service and atmosphere. You will find a deal that will work with you.. happy hour or reverse happy hour ,you 're bound to find something that will fill your belly with deliciousness and a drink that will warm ya up!"}
{"text":"Came back here recently, about 9 months since my last trip.  Disappointed, I must say.  Quality has gone downhill, it seems.  Fish not as fresh as last visit, and rolls have taken on a more is less approach.  That is, pile on more goop but give 'em less fish.  The sauces are overwhelming, sticky and sweet.  I don't remember this the last visit.  The sauces should complement the fish, not drown it."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst place ever ! Saw roaches crawling in the bathroom. Sushi maker doesn't use gloves and saw him taking out trash and then came back and made more sushi!!!The waitresses add their own gratuity to your your bill! Even if it's just one person they add whatever they want to their bill. When asked to speak to supervise they make excuses that managers are available. Please check your receipts as they add whatever amount they want as their tip. STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILTHY PLACE"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Great sushi specials all day. A full bar and comfortable atmosphere. They're open until 2am but you want to get in here before 1:30 so they don't close the kitchen on you if you're coming in to eat. Sit at the bar if you want to watch some TV as you relax to eat and drink."}
{"text":"Let's start with the appearance . Not the cleanest . The chairs are stained they have boxes and garbage in one of the see through sushi stations the chairs have tennis balls on them. There is graffiti on the walls come on a can of paint is like 20$ .. We got the d backs roll .. More like the condom roll it was wrapped in spring roll film so horrible and groose . Never eating here again ."}
{"text":"Disappointing to say the least....
This is my 4th time here and I wouldn;t have gone here so many times if it wasn't the proximity to MCC. Each and everytime I have been rather dissapointed with teh level of service which has been slow and blase at the best of times.
 This time around I had to wait 20 miniutes at teh sushi bar (after my order) before teh chef showed up. By then I had lost interest in suchi and Saketini as a whole. I would understand if this place was crowded but there were only 2 other groups and that too none of them were at the bar.

Note to self: Never venture here again"}
{"text":"This place has a bunch of great sushi rolls. They are a little pricier than some other places but their sushi is better than a lot of places so I feel they are fairly priced for what you get and have \"half off\" prices on many of their rolls during their happy hour. Cocktails are good and the service is always fast and the waitresses are friendly."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago and ended up only getting one drink because they were out of all of the alcohols required to make a manhattan (which is what the BF wanted). I had their saketini and it was very weird and tasted a lot like seaweed. Not my fave. Their menu didn't have a lot of vegetarian items, so we passed and went somewhere else. I don't think I would come back here again for drinks, but I may try their food sometime."}
{"text":"I love this place! On top of happy hour, they have half off Sushi from 6-10 and reverse happy hour after that. Their rolls are delicious and the food comes out fast. They even do take out! This is my go to sushi place"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been coming here for around 4 years now. The sushi is great! They have reasonable portions with a large variety of different types of sushi. I suggest the \"Firecracker\" or \"Cinderella\" rolls. 

As for there other food options, I have not tried very many but the Ramen was pretty good and the \"Chicken Katsu\" was delicious as well. 

The service use to be terrible here. We didn't care because we loved the food so much but I'm happy to say that within the last year the service is much better! They are quick to take your order and we never have any issues with refills. All of the servers are bubbly and very nice as well. 

Although the place may look dingy (it's a little run down and could use a remodel), do not let that affect your decision to dine here. Enjoy the happy hour, and happy eating!"}
{"text":"I love sakitini . However I was really disappointed because I called at 12:50 to order a California roll to go. Ps, They close their kitchen at 1AM. The guy on the phone told me they closed their kitchen down early because it was slow. Honestly, I work in a restaurant I get it but you can't just pick and choose when you want to close down the kitchen. What makes it worse is that their open until 2!!!! Unsatisfied customer."}
{"text":"Great Karaoke place and happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been here several times and I'm never dissatisfied with the food or service. All the servers are helpful,polite,and ALWAYS accommodating. I've never had something there I didn't like! Totally recommend this place to anyone wanting to try sushi for their first time!"}
{"text":"Very very expensive, food...never order it, service...none. WOW!!! This place really tops every & any place I have ever been.
Came here late at night because I wanted some soju & something to pick at but it was a huge mistake from my end!
SORRY!!!"}
{"text":"This place is cool!  Almost any time of day they have some rolls or apps on special.  3-6 PM is when the most stuff is on happy hour though.  I tried the Jelly Fish roll: had spicy octopus and cucumber with cream cheese inside.  I had to pick the cream cheese out (I find cream cheese in sushi revolting) but otherwise it was great!
I also got salmon nigiri and the spicy tuna roll. Overall the fish tasted very fresh to me. But watch out for the spicy tuna! I couldn't eat it all because it was so spicy!

I'd definitely come here again. My dining companion and I were full and our total bill was only $20.52!"}
{"text":"\"I think that without sushi, there would be no David Hasselhoff because sushi is like the perfect way of describing the insides of David Hasselhoff. He is like a protein, clean and easy. That's how I feel about myself.\" ? David Hasselhoff

This place is decent.  Friendly staff, ample seating, open until 2AM, there's a karaoke room, et cetera.  They even have a generous amount of time allotted for Happy Hour and Reverse Happy Hour.  Too bad the rolls are small and mediocre for the price they're asking.  I mean $7 for barely any salmon skin?  You're kidding me, right?  And $7 for a cocktail with barely any booze makes this girl sad.  Oh well.  I only come here when out-of-state and out-of-country friends want to mingle."}
{"text":"Karaoke:  I love to karaoke here!  The cheapest place to karaoke as it is only 5 bucks a person and the room is extremely nice in there.  The songs aren't as updated as other karaoke places, but it's neat how they have a lot of different songs in different Asian languages.  

Food:  The taste is alright, but the prices are cheap.  The servers are really nice, but the service can be really slow as they have very few workers in there."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place by far!! The service is ALWAYS great and the food is so good! I love their happy hour and reverse happy hour! Their prices are so reasonable and I love how late they are open! This is my go to place and probably my favorite restaurant! Krista and Amanda are always so friendly and are by far my favorite servers! Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual sushi restaurant with great service!!"}
{"text":"Their rolls are super inventive....and they stay open later than most Sushi Places in the Valley (2am).  

Their Happy Hour is insane! Ex: 99 cent beers on Tuesday!

I've never had a disappointing meal here, and I am pretty hard to please when it comes to sushi.

Recommendations:
Signature Roll
Squid Salad
Yellowtail Collarbone
Drinks, Drinks...drinks.

They have a little karaoke room, and full bar you can make use of as well.

1 Thing: When it's busy, be prepared to order everything at once...or you will be waiting."}
{"text":"My friend and I finished a workout and realized we were hungry and craving sushi.  We were frantically trying to find a place to eat sushi that was open late.  First of all, there aren't that many great sushi places in the Valley, simply because the fish is not fresh like any of the coastal states.  We were still on a mission.

Saketini's was open pretty late so we made stop over here.  We got a sashimi platter, albacore with crab roll, and a few other things.  The albacore with crab roll (forgot name) was very delicious.  Some of the sashimi peaces were good, but some were not as great.

Overall, we got our fix of sushi at a very late hour.  One thing that drops the rating of the restaurant is we got an automatic 20% tip added on.  We were only a party of two.  I usually leave a pretty good tip, but I do not like it when a restaurant mandates a tip.  A tip is something I feel is up to the customer based on his experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant is full of amazing workers, delicious food and an enjoyable environment. I've been coming her with my fiancé and any friends for almost 4 years and I recommend as the best sushi I've ever had. Never disappointed. Fast service. Friendly and kawaiiiii chefs and servers. Never had a complaint. I come here for all birthdays, anniversaries, etc. this is a must visit"}
{"text":"Absolutely Delish. There is always a special happening which is wallet friendly. Only suggestion is more attentive staff, but the food is YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very mixed feelings here....

the sushi is great....VERY tasty. The red dragon roll was soooooooooo good. In fact, all the rolls were very flavorful. The nigiri was ok.....I think it's more about the maki then anything at this place. (the other food was kind of mediocre.....the teriyaki is bleh, and the (tuna, was it?) cheek was overcooked and not seasoned)

However......

I'm giving two stars because service. is. horrible.

There were probably about 50 people there last night (when we were leaving, they said it was weird for it to be that busy on a Thursday, normally Monday's are bad....go figure) Anyways, with 50 people there, there were only two servers. (they said one got sick and didn't show.....but, apparently their phone must not have been working either, because they failed to call someone else to come in) So, right from the get go, service was slow. It took a good 10 minutes before anyone attended us after being seated.  A weird thing was, we told the Maitre'D (who was also the other server) that we would possibly be 4, but the others were late. She insited we sit at a small two seater table until we were sure they were coming, to keep the big tables open for groups (wait a sec.....I just realized they said it's 'weird to be this busy on a Thursday'......huh. strange.) Anyways, our friends did end up coming and we had to move tables in the middle of our meal. 

The happy hour is....not the best, anyways. My husband ordered a wells, after another 10 or so mins of waiting, he asked about his drink, which the server said they were out of, then realized they WEREN'T out, and 20 minutes later finally brought the drink..... The thing about the sushi on the happy hour menu is that, for 4.50 you get 4 pieces. My friend had to order two because one wasn't enough. So, she ended up paying full price anyways. 

As for the restaurant itself....it's caught between two worlds. I'm not sure if it's more restaurant, or more club. In either case, it needs a face lift. It feels like an old cruiseship.....(brown and orange aren't the most inviting colors).....The people that were there were pretty much all under 25 and loud and rambunctious....It was about 10:30 at night, but...I didn't think this was a club....... 

I think I'll bookmark this place as one to come to when everything else is closed (they're open till 2am) and I get that midnight sushi craving, otherwise; Thank you, but I'll pass......"}
{"text":"This is the closest sushi place to me after Crazy Sushi & Crab (see previous review) and Senor Sushi (due to reviews, I have no plans to go here.) I live in the heart of Mesa's Asian Business District, so I rarely venture outside of it for the foods that I love. 

Saketini has a decent happy hour and several rolls. People love this place and are regulars. I've been a couple of times and even brought friends. One of the last times I ordered off the happy hour menu I thought, wow there's a lot of crab mix in here (a roll that the main ingredient was supposed to be tuna.) I gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought, well maybe they're just having an off day. I went back this weekend and was disappointed, because they're stuffing the rolls with crab mix when that's not what is being advertised; the last time wasn't a fluke. If I wanted a California roll (which is not even proper sushi), I would have ordered one. I asked the waiter if he could ask the chef about it and the waiter began to argue with me and eventually said, well it's probably just to bring costs down. I said, oh okay I understand, we'll take the check. I won't go back. If you claim to be a sushi place, why are you cutting corners? It's a culture, it's an art. Maybe their specialty rolls are better and the happy hour rolls are a scheme to make extra money with small portions? Who knows. I'm not really interested in going back. Really, it's a shame, I liked going there.

Side note: I feel like an absolute fool for forgetting that Toh Zan Nagasaki Grill is within WALKING distance from Saketini, has glowing reviews, and every time I drive by I go, \"I still need to go in there! Definitely a Japanese mom and pop place.\" I've looked at the menu and it looks amazing and well priced. I will be going there the next time I am craving sushi."}
