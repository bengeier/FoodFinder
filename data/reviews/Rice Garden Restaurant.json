{"text":"Great little place in the neighbourhood. Items I recommend include spicy green beans, house special hakka noodle, chilli chicken and Bombay chicken. Food is flavourful and spicy (if you ask for it spicy). The food is similar to Spicy Dragon or Fredericks. Not as good as Spicy dragon but it's very close to our place and they deliver.  Prices are very reasonable as well. Did not give 5 stars because some items were slightly over salted for my taste."}
{"text":"This place is honestly the worst place I've eaten Chinese food.  The \"three item\" was 9/10th noodle and a few small pieces of chicken on top.  I asked for an Arizona iced tea, she wouldn't let me pay extra for it instead of a pop (included in meal)... She wanted me to pay additional full price for the nosed tea which made now sense. Aside from all that, the actual food tasted awful.  Maybe the rest of the me he is better?  I won't be around find out after listening to the chef in the back hack a boogers and coughing loudly and snorting.  Who does that?!!!  Gross!"}
{"text":"The place is no longer called Golden Lucky. It's called Rice Garden.   My very first time trying out hakka food. I actually ordered Crispy Ginger Beef, Bombay Chicken, and Chicken Manchurian Hakka Noodle for take-out. The Crispy Ginger Beef was tasty. The Crispy Beef was stale by the time I got home. I'd definitely like to try it while it's still hot. The Bombay Chicken at your first bite was bland then it becomes salty and spicy. The Manchurian Hakka Noodle was okay.   Decoration: There wasn't really any decoration.   Service: No problems."}
{"text":"After numerous take outs and delivery from Golden Lucky, I can finally write an update.  And the verdict is....I LOVE THEM!  I have not dined-in since the restaurant is more of a take out of delivery kind of joint for me.  However, I sincerely hope they stick around for a long while because what I've been getting from them will blow any other Chinese restaurants within 5 mile radius right out of the water.    Since my last review, I've tried their Singapore noodles (great flavour and always with ample meats, veggies and curry seasoning), Spicy chicken wings (Yummy with chili flakes and very little sauce on massive deep fried wings), Ginger beef (the way I used to remember the ginger beef from Calgary - crisp fried beef strips with sweetened ginger soy sauce), Chili chicken, Spicy eggplant, Beef with green beans, Fish with vegetables...etc.  My experience here has been one of consistency and great value.  One thing I would like to mention is that there was one time when our food tasted like old oil.  You know how some restaurants don't change their frying oil when they should?  Yeah, one of our dishes (Chili chicken) were made of deep fried morsels of chicken and it bore the unfortunate taste of stale oil.  But it was just that one time only so I can look passed it.    Their service is prompt and courteous and delivery is very quick."}
