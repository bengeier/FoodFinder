{"text":"Great visit on a Friday afternoon.  This was my first visit here.  Food was great.  Love how it was made fresh.

Plenty of staff on a busy day.  The place looked clean and presented very well.  

I will certainly be back.  I really enjoyed that my wife and I were able to eat for less than twenty bucks."}
{"text":"the restaurant is very clean but the food is such a disappointment. it's served in styrofoam containers? and it wasn't hot when i got it, which took 15ish minutes. no chips and salsa. the water was gross as well. the cashier also looked like she didn't want to be there. now i know why!!! don't waste ur money here lol"}
{"text":"This location opened a while back and we had driven by several times and looked inviting so we stopped there for dinner.  First the good points.  The restaurant is very clean, large and inviting with four large screen TVs and plenty of seating space and plenty of parking.  What I really like is that the entire kitchen is in full view and that kitchen is very clean and orderly.   You order your food at the register and when your number is called you pick up the tray of food and seat yourself.  The were a lot of food choices and the prices were very reasonable.  Unfortunately the food left a lot to be desired.  The tamale plate was more like tamale soup and my wife's cheese enchiladas were swimming in a pool of red sauce and she could barely find any cheese in the enchiladas.  The food is served in sectioned take out styro foam boxes.  There were many people working hard behind the counter but there were no forks in the utensil tray,  some of the soft drink dispensers were not working and trash containers were filled to the top. It is likely we will not come back to this particular site."}
{"text":"Ok !!! Second time here !!! NOT impressed!!! Extremely disappointed!!! I'm a huge fan of the original in Phx !!! We tried it when they first opened and they said the had no carne asada !!! I was ok with that because I like the shredded beef !! Then we were going to order take out on the night of the big fight ' I called and they said sorry we're closing in 5 minutes!!! WHAT at 6pm on a Saturday?????? Went there again tonight ' no carne asada ' she said \" it's a process \" what ???? SO over this place !! I ask for extra salsa for my chips and she acts like it's a sacred item !! Almost put one of the red catchup containers filled with salsa in my bag when I left since I didn't have to ask anyone for one of them since they just sit out on counter!! Won't go back !!! Only to Phoenix location!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Carolona's in Avondale. My first impression upon entering was disappointment.   I knew off the bat I didn't like the concept of standing in line to place order then wait for your number to be called. No chips or salsa placed on table that extra. I ordered water and was given a small cup for water, which is fine. The water is not filtered, straight up city water, yuck! Previous reviews talk about long waits for their order.  My was about 15 minutes.  Not bad since I believe all food is served out of steam pans.

Food was served in a styrofoam container, not good. I ordered Chile Verde  (green chile), with beans and rice. I'll start with the rice. Spanish rice is not supposed to be sticky clums of unseasoned rice. The beans were super watery with very little flavor. Now the main dish, Chile Verde. I'll just say that as a twenty year retired teacher I've had better Chile Verde for lunch off school menu, honestly!!

I was having dinner with my daughter in law and two granddaughters.  They hardly touched their plates and we are not picky eaters. Truly disappointed and would suggest not choosing Carolinas as a place to eat."}
{"text":"I will begin my review by mentioning the atmosphere by saying there was none! When walking in there is no music no greeting... Felt like you were entering the school cafeteria. They need to live in the place up a little... The chips and salsa tasted burnt and watery. The food was just ok....I will say the portions are huge. But I would rather enjoy a green chili burrito elsewhere."}
{"text":"Let's hope someone from management reads this and acts on it. Your wait time is absolutely ridiculous, 45 minutes for 2 burritos and then 1 hour for a cup of menudo???? There is no ownership on prioritizing tickets on the line, why would a cup of already made menudo take an hour to pour into a cup? The food is great, the location is very clean and easy on the eyes. This location either needs a better manager or maybe shuffle employees from the downtown location to come help these new guys. I'll continue to be a loyal customer just not this specific location."}
{"text":"I once tried this place and went back to give them the benefit of the doubt and it was still a disappointment. I will say that both times I've been there, the staff is nice and the place is very clean. They have a limited selection of meat and to me it's a lil pricey. I've ordered their tamales which were soggy and lacked any taste and their tacos which tasted like a filibertos taco. The horchata was chalky/watery . Wait time is very minimal but I'll never go back again."}
{"text":"Environmental is good. It's wide open and clean. It's a cool set up 

I ordered a large menudo and my girl a bean and cheese burrito. 

It's safe to say those two items are already made just need to be served. It took over 20 min for us to receive those two simple items. I asked them if they were making the beans from scratch. They replied the beans are already made. They just need to roll it up in a tortilla and add cheese. 

When I received my menudo(soup) it came in a regular cup. There was no way to eat it there. We were already upset for waiting over 20 min. We just grabbed our food and left. 

The bean burrito was good. The menudo tasted old. We will not be going there again due to the horrible service and awkward way they serve there food.

They also nickel and dime you to death. $1.65 for a tortilla that didn't come with my menudo."}
{"text":"Not coming back to this new Avondale location until they have a better trained and more caring staff.  Went there Saturday night around 9 pm and the place was pretty empty, not a good sign.  Even though it was almost empty, it still took 25 minutes to get my 2 person orders.  Got machaca enchiladas and the tortillas were hard and cold.  This establishment needs to hire a person that knows how to run a restaurant if they want to succeed.  Not looking good for them I'm afraid."}
{"text":"Great place to get some good fast mexican food. Staff is nice. The new building in Avondale is nice and open. And the food is always good."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm hooked! They have the most amazing machac a I've ever had! I'll never have it anywhere else, EVER! Hubby had the bean and potato breakfast burrito, he said he definitely get it again. I'm stuffed and already can't wait to go back and try the greencorn tamales."}
{"text":"Well after visiting the new location in Avondale I have to say my experiences on both occasions has been less than spectacular.  In both occasions we waited 30+ minutes for our food which was for two people.  The person who ordered before is waiting over 45 minutes for his order.  My most recent visit food was over 30 minutes to get our order and when we did get our food it was cold.  I told the counter our issue and they immediately remade our order but the cheese in the cheese enchiladas wasn't melted.  I was really looking forward to this new location opening but after two visits I'm really thinking about just going to one of the other locations."}
{"text":"Meh is right. The only reason that I did not give them one star??? The person taking out order was nice, and the place is clean.

This gringa makes better Mexican food. Basic American, Mexican food. They have limited selections of meats.  Not even carnitas. 

We will not be back.  If you want authentic Mexican food, go North on Dysart to the Food City grocery store!!!"}
{"text":"My son and I ate lunch at Carolina's. We had wanted to eat at Tony's Mexican Restaurant, but it was packed so we decided to try Carolina's. The menu was lacking, the food even more so. The enchilada tortilla was chewy and had to be cut with a knife, the cheese was not even melted and the sauce was a disappointment. The beans and rice were good. The taco shell was neither soft or hard, it was chewy and tough The restaurant has plenty of seating and staff, there were very few customers and the wait for our food was about 15 minutes. Needless to say, we wont be returning. We should of waited for Tony's."}
{"text":"I've heard so many things about 
Good and bad, so hubby decided it was time to give it a try. 
Here goes: No menu boards, one menu taped to counter in b/w. Customer Service was helpful but the cashier next to him was angry and mean to customers. We ordered #3s and the good was luke warm at it's best. They have tons of employees twiddling their thumbs and snapping towels at each other. Food comes slow and customer service was null and void when looking for utencils. We did however get a replacement meal with ease. I probably won't go back, just not my style."}
{"text":"55 minutes wait for two meals.. and when I asked the girl up front why the long wait, after waiting 40 mins, she had a snarky attitude and responded \"they're making ur breakfast, it's gonna be another 15 minutes\". Absolute ridiculous wait times for having all of 7 tables of people. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Come here if you want a mediocre burrito and you don't mind waiting FOREVER to get it."}
{"text":"Don't let the fancy new look fool you! This place is ridiculous! I understand family business have problems amongst themselves but if you're going to operate under the same damn name you should at least keep the menus the same! The location in Peoria and north Phoenix are way better! This one is owned by the same woman who owns the Mohave location and it's awful. No customer service whatsoever! I asked for kids meals like the Peoria location offers and you would have thought I asked the cashier to cure cancer. The salsas different here, the food taste different as well. Not in a good way. Do yourselves a favor and drive to 91st and Peoria if you want Carolinas and give the other sister your money. The sister that owns the one in Avondale doesn't deserve it. There are better places in Avondale that are more worthy of your hard earned dollars. Raul and Theresa's is about a mile away and is way better than this. If I was able to give this place a negative star rating it'd be -5 stars. Seriously. It's that bad."}
{"text":"Great fast casual Mexican food.  I love their salsa, or red sauce, as it's called.  The orders take a while to come out, but everything we have tried here has been good and worth the wait.  I don't understand people complaining about the wait time.  It's not a fast food chain.  The restaurant has always been clean and they have several employees that walk around bussing tables all the time.  Staff is friendly and willing to answer questions about the menu. Glad to have Carolina's on this side of town!"}
{"text":"I wish I didn't even have to give this place one star. I am an Arizona native and a lover of good Mexican food. I try a place when recommended by a friend because I would hate to miss out on a yummy local Mexican restaurant. So we went to Carolinas on a recommendation and we waited 1 hour for our dinner. 1 HOUR!! I can make a nice dinner in my kitchen in an hour. And I had to go ask about my order 3 times before it was ready. What did I order? Well a very complicated 2 chicken tacos, a quesadilla for my toddler and a bean burrito. Trying to be patient because they had just opened I took my very complicated order to my table (which now had two very hungry, grumpy kids) to eat. It wasn't even HOT!! And it was mediocre. The beans were okay and there was no rice. THEY RAN OUT OF RICE! But they didn't say a word, they just doubled up the beans. Everyone in there was upset so I didn't see the use in complaining. I am willing to wait for mind blowing food, but not mediocre. I wouldn't go if someone else was buying. Bleh!"}
{"text":"Love the large tortillas and the bean burritos! The beans ARE a little runny but the taste is pretty great! :)"}
{"text":"At the corner of Dysart and MC 85. This place is the best in the west valley. Combination plates are typically $6.99. You have to try their chicken green tamales. Best I've ever had from a restaurant. They make the best flour tortillas in front of big windows. Ordered two just to dip in hot sauce, it was awesome! Tacos get a 9 out of 10. Recommend! Beans and rice are good, but could be served hotter. Food comes in a Styrofoam box but is great. Place is very clean. My wife and I highly recommend. They're closed Sunday, but I respect workers getting a weekend day off."}
{"text":"Growing up in Phoenix, Carolina's has been a staple, (along with the now defunct and greatly missed La Pasadita on Van Buren, and Pitic). When I heard Carolina's was opening in the west west valley, I was super excited! The building is fantastic, and extra large, with plenty of seating. I even love the window looking in to the kitchen. What I didn't love was the service, and sadly some of my favorite foods. The staff is so young, and they look miserable and unsure of what they're doing. The food felt rushed, even though it took a while to receive it (even though it was slow!) I'm giving 3 stars this time for the \"Meh\" experience as a whole, and because I love Carolina's on Mojave, and the Peoria location, too, I'm going to go back again soon and hopefully be able to give these folks another star or two."}
{"text":"The food at Carolina's is good but the wait for food is ridiculous! I called in food for pickup and they told me 15 minutes. I showed up at the 20 minute mark to pickup my food and they had not even started preparing it. They told me 15 MORE minutes. The kitchen staff were rude and uncaring when the front staff asked how long it would take to get my order ready. So disrespectful!!! I am again disappointed by the overall service at this location."}
{"text":"Food definitely is improving from when they opened . Not quite as tasty as the one in Peoria. Issue I have is they are slow to sever food even when business is slow. So many workers (young teens) standing around socializing."}
{"text":"The tortillas are getting a little too thin other than that the red chili is spot-on and so is the salsa can't go wrong with that definitely a place to go back to just got to make them flour tortillas a little thicker"}
{"text":"Ordered a vegetarian burrito, not one, not twice, but three times and no luck. The first time he only gave me beans wrapped in a tortilla forcing me to drive back to get what i paid for. The second had beef in it and no pico. And finally the third yet again had beef in it, i don't see why you would put meat in a vegetarian burrito after i specifically said, \"i just don't eat meat, it makes me sick\"."}
{"text":"Carolinas is usually one of my go to places on the Westside for Mexican food. The food is usually really good and they do have the best tortillas. The only setback I would have to say is are slow service. It doesn't seem like they ever have enough people working. They could bump up their staff this place would be so much better."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb and when it comes to their chicken or beef tacos they can't be beat! I love the look of the new place it is huge. It is always clean and they have a good drink selection too. I always get the foot long chorizo with beans and a cheese tortilla with plenty of salsa it is perfect!  I have been going to Carolina's for years and I am so glad they built one in the west valley. I could not be happier!  I would recommend the chimichanga, chips, and their guacamole is spicy and tasty."}
{"text":"This location is super airy and clean. Unfortunately the staff is not super helpful and very young. We did get our food eventually. Unfortunately, it looked horrible. I had a chimichanga and it was completely exploded but they just plopped sour cream over it. If you eat with your eyes first, kinda disappointing. The food, however, was good... except the very hard chips that were almost inedible. 
We might give this one another try, but only because of the Peoria location. 
I do wish they had all the drinks the other locations have."}
{"text":"50 minute wait for a chimi and flautas to go.... we were so hungry and tired of waiting I ordered two tortillas with butter, 18 minute wait. ??? Why"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE experience at the new Carolina's in Avondale. I understand it's a new establishment and it's fast food, so I don't expect outstanding customer service. However it was anything but fast. It took nearly 45 minutes for our 2-person order to come up. The others in our party had already finished eating and we ended up having to get the order to go. Nothing aside from a quick \"sorry about that\" was said. 

To top it off, 2 of the 4 items we ordered were wrong when we got home. Certainly will not be returning."}
{"text":"I like their tortillas and their chorizo is really good.
My favorite is the Oaxaca special. I did not see it advertised as well. I grew up loving the one on Mohave as a kid now they are in Avondale. The family owned and operated business has got away from the term FAMILIA! They started out very well loved in Phoenix and as the chain grew with family the culture of the place also changed! I still love  Carolinas but disappointed that the Love for people and food got lost as they grew! Reading some of the yelp reviews sadden my heart that the crew and management didn't make it right. You should always walk away from this place with a belly full and a smile on your face!"}
{"text":"Hella Nasty! I was just there and I ordered the two tacos dinner and chips. Chips were hella STALE and the taco shells were STALE and gross. Chicken was unseasoned and old tasting. Paid $21 for a plate of nastiness. I'll Never go back there"}
{"text":"The food tastes pretty good here; it's more tex mex than authentic Mexican. The meat is chunky with spices but it's good and the flour tortillas are made on the spot. This establishment feels that because they make fresh tortillas, they can dispense with customer service. 

In spite of the army of people they have working behind the counter and in the kitchen (I counted 15) compared to the 2 to 3 people working in a typical Mexican restaurant, this place serves food slower than molasses. I made the mistake of ordering one extra truck after my initial order. The timestamp on my receipt taco says 16:41 (4:41pm) and it's now 1706 with no sign of my one single taco!! That is exactly 25 minute wait for one taco. Thank God it's a Sunday and I have nothing to do. Still this  has got to be the slowest service of any fast food joint I've ever been to in my entire life.  If not for the food, I would give them one star.  I got my taco at the 30 minutes mark and the server lady who seem to be in a more bossy position just gave me attitude and was unrepentant about the 30 minute wait."}
{"text":"I put in a phone order for 6 burritos (2 green, 2 bean and 2 red/bean mix) and was told it would be about 15 minutes. I showed up at the 25 minute mark and my order still wasn't ready. I had to wait an additional 20 minutes. A 45 minute wait for a few burritos should never happen. 
The burritos were not rolled tight and they were boring."}
{"text":"Granted they're trying to carry the weight of the historic Mohave location and they just opened up, so minor mistakes, place is till far more price savvy and delicious than the other fast food chains in the area/city. Keep going back for that good eating. If you haven't yet, give them a try. You won't have the stomach ache from over/undercooked other places feed you."}
{"text":"First time here. The restaurant was clean and the views out the big glass doors is Beautiful. In the foreground is a park with big trees and beyond that is a great view of Estrella Mountain. The food is made fresh so it took a little while to have our number called. At the pick up counter everything comes out in styrofoam containers. Opening the lid I found Hugh servings. Everything tasted fresh and home made. I used to work at Taco Cabana many years ago in Texas and the taste reminded me of them. Overall happy and will be back"}
{"text":"As I sit here in shock, I thought I would share. I ordered a taco, cheese enchilada combo. When I cut my enchilada the cheese was not melted inside. It was literally cold. I asked a young girl behind the counter about it not being cooked and she told me it comes like that especially when they are really busy and don't have time to melt it in the microwave. I may be a \"coconut\" but I know cheese should be melted in enchiladas. 
My husband spoke to a manager and he kindly fixed it, which redeemed my reputation about them. Hired help, that doesn't really care to help only hurts the owner of the business in the end."}
{"text":"As Carolina's just opened recently we thought we would give it a try knowing there were others around Phoenix. We were very disappointed. This isn't even a good fast food restaurant. I ordered soft chicken tacos. There was grease running out of them and I'm not even sure the meat was chicken. Spicy but no flavor. My husband ordered a beef enchilada and couldn't find any beef in it! Total waste of money. Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"Not what I thought it was gonna be...this is poor version of what the original is. The food was not made with care; there's not one person behind the counter or in the kitchen who looks like the can cook Mexican food. I dub this place a high end Taco Bell, in fact Taco Bell tacos are crunchier than Carolina's. The owners need to figure how to get the cooks from south Phoenix to the West Valley pronto."}
{"text":"123 stars today!! That's me being generous! Waited over 30 minutes for my order when I walk up to the window to claim my order I'm given the wrong order. 

Their number system does not work there calling two different sets of group numbers completely losing everyone in there. 


I think we need to have Chef Ramsey visit Carolinas someday. How to operate a restaurant 101 Hells Kitchen mishaps!! Lol  food was ok definitely not as good as original or Peoria TBC.."}
{"text":"My husband and I save all month to eat at Carolinas one Friday per month.  We usually go to the one on Peoria... BEST food by far! We were in Avondale and excited to see the new Carolinas so we stopped in.   I only ever order the beans and my husband gets rice and red Chile.  The beans were AWFUL!!! They were so watery they poured out of the container like soup made from blended beans and water.  The two young women at the registers were rude.  I was so disappointed.  We have been singing Carolinas praises for 20 years... we've sent all out of town guests to Carolinas for the best authentic Mexican food in town.  It is unfortunate that we cannot include the Avondale site in that accolade."}
{"text":"As much as it pains me, I have to go 4 stars instead of 5.  I have been eating at Carlolina's since childhood and I have eaten at every single one of them.  I was aware that the new Avondale location had glitches based on their FB page.  

Cash Only still as of now.  No problem, I came prepared with cash.  It was slow, so we went straight to the counter.  Ordered with our young lady, boy lemme tell you the young lady needs a lot of formal training.  She looked young, but let's get her trained up.  She kept asking questions on a simple 2 person order.

Food took maybe 10mins.  So I did not experience the long delays everyone is talking about.  

The place is by far the nicest of all of them.  All new furniture, tons of places to sit, 4 big 60in LED Tv's.  There is glass in the lobby so you can see the cooks cooking which is pretty cool.  Tons of parking spaces. 

The food was as good as all other Carolina's and the opening glitches will be worked out I'm sure.

Can't wait to comeback!"}
{"text":"Total disappointment! Came here because of the great reviews ... my burrito was soggy and the salsa tastes like pure garlic and oregano ... if you love Mexican food I would not recommend."}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed with this place . I went here earlier today and got number 8 beef enchiladas. & I been moving around all day so I wasn't able to eat until now. & I have cheese enchiladas instead of what I freaking ordered. I am extremely upset first meal of the day and I cannot even eat that crap. I would have gave 1 star but I'll give them 2 since I ate the beans & rice which were decent but didn't fill me up. I will be call first thing tomorrow & I better not get any trouble because I'm going to sleep hungry all because they gave me the wrong food!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food gets one star the service 0. Never seen so many Lazy workers in my life. 
Beans have good flavor BUT way too runny!! Seriously , the beans ran out the bottom of my burrito onto the wrapper, the burrito was not wrapped good and the tortilla was basically under cooked. Had to use a spoon to eat the beans.... Pittyfull. Will not return here again. Rather eat at Taco Bell than here. 
Do Pablo's down the road is waaaaay better.
I'm a Mexican and I know my Mexican food, if a restaurant can't get the beans right you can't get anything else right."}
{"text":"Never can go wrong here. The food is delicious, the prices are amazing and everything is so fresh. You can even see the ladies making fresh tortillas thru the big see through Windows."}
{"text":"Well i'm a customer of Carolinas on Peoria, every now and then,  and decided that I would try the new one in Avondale on Dysart since i'm in Goodyear, BIG MISTAKE! I basically wanna hurl right now, not kidding. First of all, I waited and waited and waited,(an hour), a man sitting with his family next to me commented because he noticed how long i'd been waiting, he said he had finished a long time ago and his daughter just got there and he ordered and got her order right away. So, not sure what's going on in the back \"assembly line\",they certainly had a ton of people working,  but something is not right. I usually wait five to ten minutes as the Peoria location is super busy, but never this long. I finally went over and asked if they even ordered it, he went back and told me they were making it right now, four burritos. Bean, bean chorizo potato, red machaca, and green machaca, so finally got home and we sat down to eat, my husband asked where this was from, my son is a fan of Carolinas, he couldn't finish eating, well non of us could, it was a bunch of gross mush that personally, I would not feed one of the wild starving coyotes out here. I can't believe I just handed them twenty dollars for that when I could have gone to Ramiros. I couldn't even distinguish what the chorizo was, or anything else, for that matter, it was a pile of mush, I would have preferred Taco Bell  or any frozen burrito, honestly. I will never visit another Carolinas again, ever!  Never again and really I don't give them one star, just have no other option. People will wise up to this place and they will soon be empty. P.S. Customer service is as bad as the food, seems they hire too many young people with no people skills, the kid wouldn't even look me in the ye and when I made a comment he just ignored me. If the employees are a reflection of the \"company\" they should be very worried."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem in Avondale. They are known for their tortillas. Plenty of room to stretch out. You can also order tortillas to take home. Yum!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is rated so low. Don't get me wrong, it's not without its shortcomings, but the food is so good. Dat green machaca!!! So good!

In reality I would give 4 stars, but I think this place is more deserving than an overall 2.5 star rating, so here you go, Carolina's! Hope my 5 star rating boosts your image to something more deserving! 

Sincerely, 

Your Loyal Customer"}
{"text":"Tried this place today with my husband  and two boys. The only one who could say they liked their food was my six year old, no kids menu, so he got two tacos. He loved them but I could taste crisco every time I tasted his tacos. Hahhaaa yes everytime I tasted them. We got the green chili burrito. It has zero taste and the beef seems dry and bland tooo. My oldest got a bean and potato burrito and of course I tased it. Not warm and tasteless. Only reason to rate the place any stars is for cleanliness. There's tons of employees for very little amount of business. The cost to employee those people probably took away from the quality of food. Tons of kitchen and cooking space but it doesn't seem like anything was cooking. Which made us think maybe our food was pre made from way earlier."}
{"text":"This is a new location, so I won't give it a 1 star. I'll change my review if they improve, but for now, stay away from this place during lunch hours. The food is good, but nothing like the original Carolina's. The main problem I see is management. They're always backed up on orders, losing orders, taking way too long, or getting orders wrong. My food has never looked this bad in all my visits to Carolina's. It's new, so I'm hopeful they can resolve this."}
{"text":"The only thing good was the prices. Confusion with the ordering process. Using your debit card was a hassle. No music very quiet and no ambiance.  Our food took 23 minutes place was only half-full. Employees were everywhere. Food served with cheap paper plates and Styrofoam. Asked for the manager said too busy, manager finally came and said your choice if you want to come back. Food was marginal and nothing special to say the least. Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Last night, I tried this location for the first time and their food made me sick.

I recommend avoiding.

Oh, the regret!  I wish I had a time machine...

Carolina's should refund me the $16.00 I paid for their diseased food.

I have suffered much torment and deserve recompense!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time two weeks ago with lunch for co workers food was great! Ever since then I'd been wanting more last night 4/3/2018 at about 8:10 I show up with my husband the door is unlocked we walk in to order at the counter and the guy behind the counter tells me they are closed and cannot place my order but Yelp said they were open until 9pm. He even still asked the cooks if they could make a red chili burrito they said no that they had already put away everything. So I left empty handed no food at all. Please update your hours online and on your website."}
{"text":"Ok so I've been going to Carolina's since I can remember and I've been to all locations so I'm definitely a fan. This location is definitely bigger, and nicer. The food does seem to take longer and I've been to this location twice since they've opened but did not do a review on my first visit because it was so obviously struggling with the opening as I went the 2nd day of opening. Ok, so now I've been back.... Customer service is definitely lacking big time,  I don't even think my cashier even spoke one word other than my total and I actually had to ask her for my cups and what number cause she just handed my receipt and change not a single word. Then there wasn't any ice in their drink machines and 2 of the machines were marked out of order on several of the drinks. The wait was longer than other locations. Hopefully they will work out the kinks. The restrooms were clean, stocked and tables were clean. They are fully staffed with several just standing in place not doing much so I'm not sure why everything was taking so long. I'll still come back as I've always done...."}
{"text":"Thinking this place would be great sucked ass first of all. I didn't get a good or welcoming vibe like I do in other places such as senor taco and Filibertos. The only thing I liked was the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"All I can say is, this place is blah. The decor, the atmosphere and the food are all the same, BLAND and BORING! I am not a big fan of mariachi music, but I never in my life wanted to hear it more in a restaurant setting. There is no music and no sound whatsoever, you can literally hear a pen drop. This location is a little too modern for this fast food joint, and the lack of customers to fill the seats make the space feel so huge and unwelcoming. Lastly, the food was tasteless and disappointing. Don't get me wrong, the quantity is BIG, but if you want delicious Mexican food, this will not satisfy you. I hate writing a bad reviews for a struggling places but I believe an honest review will help avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"First of all, the tortillas here are amazing. Great spot to find some authentic Mexican food. The service can take awhile at times but it's always worth the wait. Huge dining area with plenty of tvs."}
{"text":"I am happy to say that the opening kinks seem to have been worked out. The staff was friendly and helpful. The debit card machines are in and hooked up. The tortillas ROCK! The only reason for the missing star is the lack of bacon and ham as options for the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Carolina's on the West Side?  About freaking time, right?  

Decided to drive on down here today to grab some lunch.  I had not sampled some of Carolina's delicious beef tacos in quite some time, and I had a small craving.  It's very cool that this spot is only about a 20 minute drive from my house, instead of almost 45 minutes to the one on Cactus (I still refuse to eat at the one on Peoria ever since they overcharged my debit card by $5.00.  Shady mofos...anyways!).

I pulled up to the spot and the first thing I noticed was how big this one is.  It is MASSIVE compared to the other 3.  I would say at least 2 to 3 times the size of any of the other ones.  I walked inside and was ready to grub.  I already knew what I was getting so it made ordering easy. If you didn't know what you wanted though, it may be a bit disappointing.  They do not have a menu board above the cash registers.  They have a menu taped on the counter, and take out menus handy, but it would be nice to have a menu board that you could study while waiting in line.  Anyways.... I went with 2 beef tacos, an order of chips, and a soda.  My total was just a tad over $10.00 and I was handed my receipt.  A few minutes later, my food was ready.  Here is how it was.....................

Beef Tacos-  The best thing here, by far!  Their tacos are the best hard shelled tacos in Phoenix!  The taste was pretty similar to their other locations, but I did notice a few differences.  1.  The cheese was a bit skimp.  Carolina's usually hooks up the cheese!  We are talking overflowing, and enough remnants to scoop up with some chips.  The cheese here was not as plentiful.  2.  The tacos seemed smaller, too!  Not by a whole lot, but they were skinnier and it looked like the tortillas they use were a bit smaller too.  For comparison sake, lets say the other Carolina's use a 6 inch corn tortilla, this Carolina's uses a 5 inch corn tortilla.  Not a huge difference, but a noticeable one.  Thankfully, the flavor was pretty much spot on, and even though they were smaller, they were still delicious and hit the spot!

Chips and Salsa-  The chips were really good!  Same consistency and quality as the other locations.  Salsa was on point too.  A little bit thin, but it has that unique Carolina's taste to it.  About that, also......... At the other locations, they have huge pump dispensers for that delicious salsa.  This spot does not have those.  They gave me a styrofoam cup full with my order of chips, but usually I would grab a few extra containers of it for my tacos etc.  They did have what looked like their salsa in huge ketchup/squirt bottles, but it seemed a bit inefficient.  Not sure if they bring out more bottles if its real busy, or that is all that they offer?  (There were only 2 bottles available to grab.)

Coke-  Some of the best Coke I have had!  I love it when its the perfect sweetness.  Carolina's Coke machine puts out some good drinks.  They also have plenty of options, too.  They have one Coke machine, and 2 Pepsi machines!  So whatever beverage you prefer, Carolina's has you covered!  (Very rare that you see that...offhand, I can't recall a place recently that offers both Coke and Pepsi fountain drinks...usually its one or the other.)

Overall, I was glad I stopped by.  Service was friendly and the food was tasty.  The ambiance was a little too quiet (It could benefit from some music or something), but I do love how big this place is!  Still not as good as the other locations in town, but with due time and a couple of tweaks, it could be just as good and 5 star worthy!  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Even though I read the other reviews I hoped that they had been open long enough to work out the kinks and for the most part our visit went pretty smoothly. The restaurant itself is really nice. Lots of seating, tv's and a large selection of self serve drinks. The staff was also very friendly and did not seem unorganized at all. 
The bad-it took a long time for our food to come out. I guess it would not have seemed as long if we were in a full service restaurant but since this feels more like a fast food restaurant it definitely seemed long. Regardless the biggest issue for me was the taste of the food. Mexican food is my favorite type of food and this is not the type I like. It tasted extremely greasy. I had and enchilada and beef taco. The taco was ok. I don't care for their enchilada sauce."}
{"text":"Best tortillas I've ever eaten (with the exception of my mother's)...they sell them by the dozen!"}
{"text":"Had a chicken burrito. Everything was hot fresh and delicious. The new restaurant has beautiful chicken and you can see them making fresh tortillas. Its very cool"}
{"text":"Never again! Took close to an hour, and the food was 1 notch better than frozen Mexican food from grocery store. Microwaved for 30 seconds. Nothing impressive even tortillas were no better than packaged!! What a shame!"}
{"text":"I forgot all about this dump. Unorganized, micro waved food, rude employees. My family and i went to go try it out. Lol paid for \"mexican food\". Just trying to order is an experience. 2 registers, you figure 2 lines. Nope every one had to move to the other side of the soda machine. Like 15' in front of the registers. People trying to order block people trying to get a drink. It was a friday or Saturday evening. Place reminded me of an after school camp. Nothing but teens running the place. A customer complained and the young boy shrugged his shoulders, scuffs, smerks and tells a young lady \" you deal with nigga\". That should of been my second clue to get out. My first one was walking in the parking lot. 3 kitchen staff members ( teens) are cleaning with the hose. Apparently I don't share the same humor as they do. Wetting my son with the hose. I yell wtf! And like well trained roaches, scatter back in slamming the door. I looked for a manager. But must of had the day off. Decided teens, prank not worth ruining my family time. Food order called, excited, i get to the counter. 2 styrofoam trays. Hmmm. I didnt order to go. O well. Finally, about to eat. Have you ever microwaved beans for too long. Yeah that was one of my sides. The chicken had the crust of 3 days old left open in your fridge. The only good thing i tasted was the cut lettuce and diced tomatoes. We left hungry disgusted and embarassed for that joke of a restaurant. I dont like complaining in restaurants. I called the number on the receipt i asked for a manager or supervisor. Placed on hold and 30 sec later..... Click. My wife called 3 more times same thing. We called the other place of the I17 and ?? At this point my wife is pissed. She complaint to the manager at that location. My wife asked to be reimbursed after providing our receipt the next day. The manager at the phx location nicely said we can't help you. We are not affiliated with that restaurant. My wife shockingly asked aren't you the same restaurant? No, i heard over the phone. Lmfao!! Apparently the location in Avondale is owned by the other side of the family. At this point i realized this dump is on big cluster .... O i forgot, as i was leaving the restaurant i heard crawling. I thought i hope its not a rat... Yup 2 more customers and I were disgusted and yet amazed at the size of this big ass new york movie rat. I managed to capture a small video of it. For your lack of customer service untrained employees and the seperation, ( im assuming) of the family i give you 1 star because i absolutely love the modern building."}
{"text":"First off, I get this is a new business.  As I walked in, there is a sign ion the door for cash only. I get in line and no one is there. Perfect right? As I wait for my food to go (bean burrito and chile verde burrito), a rush of new customers walk in. Lots of people are sitting and waiting for their orders. My simple order took 35 minutes to go. I was not happy and will not be returning for a while. I really hope they step up their service time and accept cards. Not everyone carries cash, and there is no bank close by. I did sit and watch the assembly line and they were just all over the place."}
{"text":"We love Carolina's but today I'm not sure who the cook was today. The beans were bland, no flavor and the Spanish rice was bland almost white with no color or taste. The tortillas were so thin we couldn't hold the burrito it fell apart. We normally go to the Peoria location but today we tried the one in Avondale. Disappointed. 

The salsa was great and the cheese crisp was good. Someone please go teach them how to cook and follow the same recipes that all the other 3 locations follow!!!"}
