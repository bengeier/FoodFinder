{"text":"Still love the place and will continue to frequent ! But I must say that on several occasions I have witnessed Tim \" the bartender\" be beyond rude and flippant to several customers ! It's too bad !"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, because it's so close to my new house.  I was sadly disappointed. The waitress was so inattentive, i felt i couldn't possibly be more important than the person she was texting or the pokemon she was trying to catch.  The food wasn't even very good. I could get the same quality from mcdonalds or pizza hut.   Save your money and starve to death, because that's better than going in and being treated like crap by some waitress who has reached the peak of her career...."}
{"text":"The family and I along with a couple friends decided to try this place for a little variety. The experience was less than stellar. If I could give no stars I would.   The Bad: Kids both wanted a cream soda (bottled) and when the waitress came back she informed us there was only one bottle left...really? It's soda for crying out loud. I decided to order a Kiltlifter (some special edition) and again....OUT! Now I'm slightly annoyed...Friday night, full house and by the way...also informed the kitchen is about 25 minutes \"behind\" so if we wanted to order an appetizer it would be best to put it in with our dinner order. Ok, whatever...we decided to order nachos. Nacho's came out STONE COLD, sent them back as they were inedible. The manager then came over (he was very nice, apologetic and again telling us the kitchen was \"behind\") apologized, offered to \"buy us a round\" (that didn't happen by the way even though we ordered a couple more rounds in the 2.5 hours we were there) and wanted to make sure we were \"happy\". Out comes nacho plate number 2, by the manager stating they were \"fresh out of the oven\". Not so much, again...STONE COLD ON cold plate. Ugh...didn't bother sending them back as it clearly was not going to do any good. So finally out comes dinner...everyone had yes you guessed it...cold food. By this time we just wanted to leave. So along comes the waitress, who is clearly annoyed and drops off the check....nachos included. Now one would think that if the manager came over, offered a round of drinks and apologized profusely about cold food and slow kitchen service that the nachos would have never made it to the bill. Needless to say we just paid and left...and will never return. Robert Irvine would be having a field day in this place! Total bill for a family of 4 for cold food and a couple beers: $78 (that included my barely deserved 15% tip (normally I go 20% all the way...not this time)  The Good: 1. Apologetic manager that seemed sincere, but clearly didn't follow through with any amount of customer service. 2. At least the beer was cold.  Save your money as there are plenty of other beer/sports bars with much better service and hot food. Can't believe this place had a full house!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location since it was Uncle Bear's and these owner have finally got it right! Service and food have never been better.   The beer selection is great and changes regularly which is great to try new microbrews or other non-commercial labels.   For sports it is great to have over 16 large screen TVs with all of the Sunday Ticket.   The Chef even came to our table to ask how everything was, and it was great to be able to give a compliment to him.   The owners are from Boston, but hey no place is perfect.   If you want a great beer or food, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection. This place has a focus on customer satisfaction and the food is very good. Josh the bartender rocks!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to The House of Brews last night. First off, it was very hot in there..almost like the AC wasn't on. We ordered the Barbecue Platter and Mac N Cheese w/Bacon. There was no barbecue sauce on the meat..which I found odd, considering it's \"barbecue\". My husband grabbed a rib and the bone came right off...we turned over the rib and it was solid fat. In further review of this pile of meat...the beef tips were fatty and the hot links looked like thin sliced carrots. The hot links tasted like kielbasa that you would buy from the grocery store, yuck! The platter also came with a pulled pork slider, in which the bread was hard and stale and there was barely any meat on the sandwich. The Mac N Cheese was alright, but the bacon in the dish was all of the fatty pieces as well... It's been awhile since we've eaten here, but we wont be back. The food was terrible and server didn't even ask why we were leaving and didn't want a to-go box for all the food we didn't eat."}
{"text":"$6 for edamame...you know the stuff that a Sushi place  serves up for free while you wait. For the quality (or lack of) that you get here the prices are definitely out of whack. Plenty of T.Vs, even in the bathroom, makes it a good place to watch the game! The big miss here though was the service,  Literally like 20 minutes before anyone came, and when she finally did, acted kind of surly (I think she was trying to be witty, but just came off rude) Staff was all kinds of chummy around the bar, which is nice...but not if I'm still waiting for my beer. Beer list is solid and extensive to be fair...but definitely not what I'd call imaginative. Flanny's in Tempe?...now THATS a place for beer lovers!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice with my husband and two small kids. This is a sports bar type place and I usually don't like to take my kids into bars. Luckily for me they are a very friendly bunch and also have kids menus and crayons. We came in here to watch a specific game and the manager was wonderful and accommodating. The waitress was great and on point the entire time. The food was great. I had the Reuben and my husband had the Mac and cheese. They have a huge selection of specialty beer. Which makes sense because of their name. Overall the place has a good feel and We will go back again."}
{"text":"Although not a \"regular\", I've patronized this establishment many times over the past 20 years through several changes in ownership. It is the bar/restaurant closest to my home. In spite of its convenient location, after my most recent visit I will not be returning. Why would I when the staff can't be bothered to feign a minimal civility? I see from the preceding Yelp reviews others feel the same. Maybe the next owners will have a higher regard for their customers."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Sat out of the patio today for lunch to watch some of the opening day Red Sox game. Food is amazing. Ordered the Ipswich fried clams which were relish and straight out of a Cape Cod menu. Husband had the Italian, which was enormous and enough to bring home half for dinner. Beer selection - more than worthy. I had the Lobster Roll lunch special and was everything I expected it to be. Thanks for the Cracker Jacks Tim! This place is great, be back very soon"}
{"text":"HOB #1 Gilbert Brew/Pub/Restaurant!  Ask for Forrest he's smaat( Boston smart) Nice and a GREAT WERKER!  We will see all y'all soon KDS"}
{"text":"The beer and service were great. We went there to see a local performer play. His show was awesome! We overheard the manager give lame excuses for why he was shorting the talented local artist his fee. There's no reason to treat a performer the establishment scheduled that way. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Went in on a Sunday mid morning to watch some football and have some breakfast.   Lots of TVs of course, great selection and variety of beers, many local breweries too, and the staff makes you feel very comfortable there.  Turns out, much better food than the standard Sports type bars. Yeah, you can get wings, nachos burgers and stuff like that but their take on making it takes them up a notch over typical sports grille faire. I had simply bacon, eggs, hash browns and toast. Boring right? Well, not exactly, they add a lot of flavor with nice details like chives on the scrambled eggs, peppers and onions in the potatoes etc. Wife had the eggs benedict. They used corned beef instead of ham or Canadian bacon like most do, jalapenos and added some other nice fresh ingredients. Later on during the afternoon games wife and I split a bowl full of steamers, was great.   Josh the bartender was attentive, Tim from the kitchen even checked on us and Aaron and other staff (that I didn't catch names) all came around to make sure we were having a good experience.   My Browns, lost...again and my fantasy team didn't do well but the was a great day here and a terrific experience. We will be back and would recommend."}
{"text":"Place was a dump anyway. Hard to believe it lasted this long.never have I seen a restaurant so filthy. Completely mis managed. People always standing around and a menu that wasn't meant for a sports bar. Sad thing is some sap will try again to reopen this dump. My advice .......burn it down."}
{"text":"Visited for 1st time on Saturday for lunch. They advertise 49 beers on tap. The 1st beer I requested was not available. I ended up with a Desert Eagle Dunkelweizen which was excellent. Tried the Pretzel Board as an appetizer. It came with 3 soft pretzels, a cheese sauce and a brown mustard. I thought it was good. I tried their Mac N Cheese \"The Original Mac\". I think everybody has different ideas of what makes a good mac n cheese so I'd say you need to try it and judge for yourself. The waitress and server were excellent.  I will definately come back."}
{"text":"Don't bother wasting your time or money here. We like to try new places and saw this place on-line and stopped in and gave it a try. We ordered a couple of waters while we looked over the 30+ beer list. Apparently this was a major turn-off for the bartender as she went over to her regulars and must have had something snarky to say about us as I notice she was motioning in our direction and soon after her regulars was looking at us. Got up and left. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Corned Beef and Cabbage was tasteless and had the odor of bad feet (was this more than day old grub?). Prices are high for the portion size you receive. If I wanted food servings the size that Tapas bars serve I would go to one in Chandler or elsewhere not HOB. Speaking of brews, I like my domestic lagers served ice cold not lukewarm like that of an English pub in Canterbury serving a pint of Bitter. Note to the weary fellow eater: Avoid this place and spend your hard earned money elsewhere. You're better off going to Vincent's on Camelback for an elegant dinner, top notch drinks and cold beer than a 21st century house of horrors, I mean house of warm brews. Letdown of the year for me."}
{"text":"Went to the old version a few times, and it was not bad....  This NEW incarnation is SOOOOO much better.  Great tap list, love that.  Great food, love that.  AND friendly prompt bar in my neighborhood vibe service.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"$10 burgers?!? Their HH is $1 off beers, Yup! That is it. Get a better HH and maybe we will go back."}
{"text":"Fish n chips are great here!  Huge selection of everything u need. Service is nice, my waiter is super nice, conversational!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to hit up for a quality beer. Many choices on tap and the staff is very helpful on the different beer styles and flavors. The food is great and the regulars are good people. Recommend this fine place to everyone. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Worst service I ever had! Join some friends on a Tuesday for lunch, we were sitting at the bar, we were the only customers  (6ppl) the bartender never said hi, she came to me and ask \"What do you want ?!\", so I ask for the menu. After a minute I made my choice, close the menu and wait for about 10min than she finally came back, I told her my order, but she seems doesn't really care what I was saying. She took the menu and left.  4 mens enter in the place, she went directly greeted them, she brought them waters, menu and them beers. At this point I had no water, no drink, no food. After taking there orders, she came back to me and said \"Sorry I forgot, what do you want?\" This was 25 minutes later, so no more time to eat, had to go back to work, so I left. I won't recommend this place to anybody!"}
{"text":"Great bar with an awesome beer selection! Good food and excellent service! Bartenders know the beers, Tyler and Val, very friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I've come here several times for decent beer selection. Tonight though, there was the smell of sewer that is overwhelming throughout the entire restaurant. We got one beer and decided to relocate somewhere else. Just a heads up on that stench."}
{"text":"Holy cow...I really wanted to like this place, but the overall experience was bad. The food came out at room temperature/cold. The service took FOREVER! Our server kept telling us it would be out in a few seconds (both drinks and food).  A few seconds turned out to be well over 30 minutes. I guess the bar was backed up and the bartender couldn't get to our drinks in a reasonable amount of time (iced tea, vanilla beer in a bottle and the cappuccino stout on tap). There was another booth next to us that hadn't even been greeted by their server...they were completely forgotten!  With all the options of bars/restaurants in the area, I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"I went in to the re opening of House Of Brews on Monday night. I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in. Finally someone has upgraded the facility. The place seemed more wide open. The tables and booths were new and there were many more flatscreen tv's throughout, including four nice sized screens above the bar. Contrary to Art's review, which is the only one, I thought the food was great, definitely abouve average bar food. I shared a delicious reuben which was served on a rye bread with swiss, braised cabbage and 1000 island. We had the house fries which were beer battered, large seasoned wedges, which were great! I was more than pleased with the draft beer selection, which seemed to be around 30 handles, including a few Four Peeks, Devils Ale, Oak Creek out of Sedona, and Nimbus. There was also other great choices like Left Hand Milk Stout, Breckinridge Vanilla Porter, Dales Pale Ale, Lost Coast Tangerine and many others. We sat at the bar, which had a great local comfort. Our bartender was Josh, who was awesome, and made us feel very welcome. He introduced himself, got our names, and used our names throughout our stay. He had great knowledge of the beers on tap and also informed us that he had over forty bottled beers. Before our Reuben, we started with a hummus trio, which consisted of Hummus, Olive tapenade, and a bruscetta made with buffalo mozz!  Served with tortilla chips and pita bread. We had a great time, and could definitely see this becoming our regular spot. I definitely recommend this place and hope it does well and is successful."}
{"text":"The bacon Mac and cheese is a must have!   Shout out to Porch for walking us through the menu and the great food."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  My wife and I both had burgers.  To quote the old Wendy's commercial; \"Where's the beef??\"  The bun was 3-4 times larger than the burger!  It was like they put a slider on a full-size hamburger bun.  What a rip-off.  Extremely disappointing.  Needless to say, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Visited HOB for lunch this week to check out the new menu,ownership etc.. Love the new ambiance and vibe -  the place is definitely on the up & up! Ordered the Spinach salad, it was very tasty, fresh chicken and avocado was delightful. They also have upcoming events and a boatload of big screens to watch ALL the games, not to mention the multitude of craft beers they have on draft... I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Spent an amazing night here at HOB. Danielle was one of the best waitresses I have had in a long time, the beer selection was excellent, and the Roast Beast sandwich was perfectly cooked. Live music was also really really good. You should  come to this bar! I know I will be back."}
{"text":"Okay the food is great, the atmospheres is the usual sports bar but still great and my waitress was the best part. Katrina is so on point with her absolutely fantastic service. Thats not all though, I love her hair, I hate to deal with businesses that act too corporate to allow colorful hair or colorful people to become employees but this place obviously is overflowing with wonderful outgoing fun people. im sure katrina gets tipped even better with blue hair haha, i know i tipped a litttle better than usual. Anyway, the food was really great but its the service that will keep me coming back. I also want to say that its not like hooters where all the makeup is required so they look like clowns."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Excellent selection of craft beer too. Big shout out to the friendly and efficient staff including Sammie and Katrina!  These are two very happy, friendly, helpful and energetic waitresses that go above and beyond customer service.  Really enjoy the individuality expressed by Katrina with her blue hair!  Very unique.  Dan is pulling the right strings to make HOB a very popular restaurant and bar."}
{"text":"Service was \"ok\" and so was the food. I had heard really good things about this place but was disappointed.  Prices are really high for what it is."}
{"text":"I almost bought a house down the street from House Of Brews just so I could go there more often! NO KIDDING!  The meat and cheese boards are INSANE, the CRAFT BEER selection both in bottles and ON TAP is always out of this world and your ALL favorite sports are always on 35ish Big Ass flat screens TVs.  YES, HEAVEN!"}
{"text":"They raised the beer prices and made this bar just average now. Before you could go drink beer listen to decent music and watch sports at an afordable price. If it stays this way I will go to Stadium Club or Rto's beter bargain all the way around"}
{"text":"The only reason we gave one star is because Yelp does not allow zero. When we first walked in, the hostess was very rude because we were meeting people who were already seated in the bar area, and she wanted us to wait to be seated even after we explained that they had already saved our seats. Later on a few others wanted to join us, but when we attempted to push 2 empty tables together she came over to reprimand us for how the tables were arranged. Then, to add insult to injury, the chef came out of the kitchen area and told us to move the tables back because, and I quote, \"You don't want to piss off the chef\". The place wasn't even busy! I ordered the meat pie which was ice-cold in the middle, and for obvious reasons I did not trust sending it back to be reheated, well, because, \"the chef does not want to be pissed off!\" The server never asked how the food was nor did he notice that I wasn't eating, so I made a point to let him know that the pie was cold. He took it back and the aforementioned chef allegedly took the temperature and said that I should have eaten it because it was at the proper temp. This is impossible, since it was cold to begin with and had been sitting for an additional 20 minutes. Also worth mentioning: the men's room was filthy, giving me reason to believe the kitchen may also be filthy! Needless to say, we will never be back."}
{"text":"This place is always out of beer they have such a great selection but never available and the food is terrible. It's only good for a beer or 2."}
{"text":"As bars go, this is certainly my favorite. I have been five times before deciding to write a review.  The food is great, for bar food fare obviously. I have had several sandwiches, all were tasty. The macaroni and cheese they brag about is also great. I am not a big fan of ordering burgers but my friends have enjoyed them.  The beer list is extensive and excellent! Just as important the servers I have had have been very knowledgeable and helpful with the items. Speaking of servers, the service here has always been great.  The last plus is the establishments willingness to give a fan of hockey a tv. Yup, as one of the few obsessive fans of hockey in the valley I really appreciate an establishment that has the tvs to spare indulging me.   Overall, I have not found a better bar establishment in the valley and you can expect to see me return."}
{"text":"This is pretty cool bar for beer lovers. There's a huge selection of drafts and to help you make a selection there are a couple of big screens showing what's on tap (most of them anyway). The information includes the name of the beer, the brewer, alcohol content and even a little icon that tells you how much is left in the keg. I have only had a couple of meals there but have no complaints about either. The only thing that kept me from giving this place the fifth star is the service form behind the bar. The guys that have served me in the past have acted like they would rather be someplace else. I can't say they were rude, just not friendly."}
{"text":"HOB use to be one of my favor places, but the last three times I have had bad service and they were out of four out of five beers i chose from their shrinking menu.  Food is still really good!"}
{"text":"Chef Tim's menu is knocking it out of the park. Not just bar food, but upscale bar food (without upscale prices), and full entrees as well. The smoked Gouda mac and cheese is to DIE for. Fried Tomato BLT was amazing. Great burgers, great portions - everything we've tried here has been a home run. And the Stout Bread Pudding? Fuggeddaboutit.  Lots of TVs to capture all the games, and an extensive beer (draught) list that has something for everyone. We've had a great experience every time, and everyone we've recommended it to or brought along with us has LOVED it.  I can't wait to go back! Tomorrow sounds perfect..."}
{"text":"I've been to hob twice. Once a couple months ago months ago we went with a huge party and my order never came out after a hour I had to go to work. Well I was walking out the door and my food came out. I told them to keep it.  I just left hob a hour ago decided on giving it another try. It was busy. Service was slow but it shouldn't take 40 minutes to put in our order and another 30 minutes for wings and nachos to come out. The nachos were dry like hey been sitting under the heater and the wing were cold on the outside and warm in the middle. Our server never came back to see us or how our food was. If you like sitting around waiting for cold food this is your place."}
{"text":"I have never cared to dine at a Sports Bar especially with kids but, I definitely would have to say HOB has changed my mind about sports bar dining. We had a lot of fun eating here with the kids and they all loved every bit of their meals. We had deep fried pickles as an appetizer and the batter was amazing. I had the Maine lobster roll with buffalo chips something I have never had before which was very delicious. The Monte Cristo was out of this world. The only other place I have had this dish was at Disneyland and I thought I would have to go back there just to have it again. So you can imagine my astonishment to see this on the menu. We just had to order it! I am a Sports bar food convert but, maybe just for HOB. Much thanks to the great staff!"}
{"text":"Food was average at best. $11 for a Mac n cheese and $13 for a steak sandwich. Service and kitchen were mixed up on several tables. Food was half delivered.  Never saw a manager. Heard many apologies but no one was offered anything.  Not impressed at all"}
{"text":"Good food, good beer, good service! Good location, and I like the fact that you can sit outside on the patio with your fury little friend. They have a nice selection of beers on tap, even if they are out of one you wanted, there is more to choose from. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Looks like there are a few people that had a negative experience here but my first experience the other night was a good one.  The place has a neighborhood sports bar feel to it but lacks a little bit in terms of identity.  There is a collection of Boston area sports memorabilia hanging in one spot but not much in the way of local team stuff.  The TV's are plenty and unless you are ultra picky I don't understand how you could not watch what you want to see.  The beer list is better than most and I had a coffee stout there that was excellent.  I only sampled the Mac and Cheese there which is made with a smoked Gouda and happened to be one of the best I've had and the french dip which was excellent.  A few of my buddies tried the steak and burger and were also very happy.  The owners were involved and hooked us up with some additional sides after talking to them a bit which was very nice.  I thought the prices were just fine but then again many people benchmark against the big chain restaurants which I refuse to support so I lack context there.  I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"This place has, without a doubt, the best beer selection in the East Valley. Not sure what you want to sip? Beau will sort you out PRONTO! Dude knows his shit. Stick around for the superb chow...it's not your typical bar fodder. I'm all about the patty melt, mac, and rib tips. Tons of TVs for sports too."}
{"text":"Looks like a great place for drinking beer. I ordered take out. Got the BBQ Meal.  It was 18 bucks and huge. Meat was over smoked to my taste. The hot links were hotter than the devil, too hot to eat. I throw them out, would even give to my dog.  I was disappointed not to see baby back ribs on the menu.  Slaw tasted like the just put a little vinegar and sugar on them and very little at that. I give it 3 star for the beer selection and the staff. If you want to drink beer great place. If you want a good BBQ go most any place else."}
{"text":"I went back today, I had the roast beef sandwich and sweet potato fries.  The sandwich was tasty but with the au jus a little salty. The fries were good.  I had two tasty session IPAs and an iced tea.  My friend had the BLT and soup of the day.  He really liked the soup and the blt was good.  The server was friendly but a little on the inattentive side.    When I got the bill for my sandwich, iced and two beers I was shocked to see it was $30.  One beer was $6 and one was $7.  These weren't high gravity beers, they were session IPAs.  I am bordering on a two star review for the unexpected price gouging.  Oh and beware, substituting Mac N' Cheese with a sandwich is a $4 upgrade.  Heck, a full side of mac is only $5.   It is too bad, I like the place, but for these prices I could eat in Scottsdale not a strip mall in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Best ribs/rib tips I've had! I'm from LA and it would be worth it to come back just for either of them. We tried them at the Great American BBQ and Brewery. We waited in line for 45 minutes to try a \"Kansas City Award Winning\" competitor (following the crowed) and these are WAY better!!"}
{"text":"First time here with friends. Waitress was slow taking drink orders and even slower with the food orders. I had to get her attention to get our food order. I ordered  the brisket sandwich on a pretzel roll with pineapple cole slaw. It sounded good. The brisket was hard and the cole slaw what little was on my sandwich was bland. No pineapple flavor. My wife's cheese crisp was good but the green chili could use some help. I'll  give this place another try some time."}
{"text":"Went there last night. First thing we were told us they are out of wings. What kind of brew house is out of wings on a Friday night?  Then we waited an hour for our meal and it never came. 2 other tables came in AFTER us, ordered, ate, paid, left and we still hadn't got our food. The only person in the place that was hustling was the bar tender. HE at least made sure we had beer."}
{"text":"Staff is informative and knew a lot about beer and food menu. Great revolving beer selection. Good selection on menu, tasty too."}
{"text":"Gave it another chance. Pretty spot on! Way to go!  Mac and cheese is the bomb!  Good service.  Easy views on tv's.   Definitely come back again."}
{"text":"go here to get thrashed on bud light. Don't go here to get lobster and caviar. And can SOMEONE buy a couple new TVs for the patio? Shit is depressing."}
{"text":"I live near by and visit often. I like the atmosphere. But the service really needs help. There is only one bartender at all times. For that size of place especially during happy hour. I think if they would add a bar back or another bartender this would help immensely. The wait time to get a beer or food is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Ive been coming to hob a long time. They finally have a quick attentive bartender in Tyler. He was a server of ours for  a long time. I saw him behind the bar a few weeks ago and immediately my wife and I both agreed we needed to sit at the bar!  Food was good, we usually have the rib meal and tips. But lately have been   on the dry and chewy side. sauces are good."}
{"text":"We love House of Brews and still do for drinks. The new menu seems a little odd for a brew pub. Gone are the brats, basic cheeseburger and French dip. They have been replaced by chicken liver mousse, a yellow fin burger and chorizo mussels. At least the Mac and cheese is still on the menu, even if it's no longer build your own."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and I don't think it's anything special. The service is hit or miss, the food is just ok, some tvs in the bar area. They do have a pretty good beer selection, with good daily specials."}
{"text":"Great place, very nice and clean, friendly staff, amazing beer selection. BUT, they are SO slow. If you order a beer, it should be at your table in 2-3 minutes - not 8-10. And, if you run out of something - you should tell the table that immediately. They are consistently slow.... If you're a slow person - then you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Went for trivia and to have some beers. Was pretty cool place. Would give four stars but our server brought us the wrong beers, when we asked about it she admitted they were wrong but still charged us for the more expensive beer price instead of what we actually got. I'd go back though not a big deal."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times just for a beer and the selection is always great. That is probably the only thing this place good for. I brought my daughters there for a quick bite to eat and a kids meal with a tiny, overcooked hamburger was $7.00 as well as $2.50 for a kids drink. She was not pleased. The other one got some basic frozen, bought in chicken strips. Three girls ended up costing $30 for a sub par meal. I ordered a $6 slider plate and got two mini rolls with less than a tablespoon of meat. I realize that they are known for their great beer selection, but that doesn't mean they should gouge their customers with no effort with what they provide"}
{"text":"Best Mac and cheese ever.  The bartender Mike (McQueen) was great and the manger Sarah runs a tight ship. The turkey club is so good I got an extra to go. Tara is my spirit animal."}
{"text":"Always a great selection of beers which is why I come here. Never had the food so I can't comment there. Always had good service. There is kinda distinct smell to the place though"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Service was poor but the food was good.   We were greeted quickly and shown to our booth. Our server came over with a beer list that looks like it had been caught in the middle of a food fight. The list had a lot of beers crossed off and then she spouted off more beers they didn't have. I wasn't impressed.   We both ordered a chicken sandwich which was very tasty but when I asked for a side of ranch, I waited and waited and waited. Finally, someone else brought it to me. Our server seemed more interested in chit chatting than actually serving us. You can't rely on your good looks forever honey, eventually you'll have to do your job correctly."}
{"text":"This place has really stepped it up. The food is amazing. It's a neighborhood sports bar with some actual class and a bit of style, where everyone fits in and has a great time. If you go, try the Salmon Sliders! Om nom nom"}
{"text":"Great choice of craft beers. BBQ pork sandwich was exceptional. Mac and cheese was solid - smokey and creamy."}
{"text":"WARNING!!!! If you come here and get the waitress with the do-rag, resting bitch face and the nicotine patch.......MOVE SECTIONS IMMEDIATELY.    REQUEST IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF SECTION, get your own drinks or go to the kitchen to deliver your own food.  We sat in amazement with this girl. It became funny during our stay, because she just kept getting worse. We had to literally WAVE our hands in the air to get attention EVERY TIME.  We stopped the underage bus boy 90% or the time and ordered drinks through him, then she would bring them.  We asked for the bill........she brought us another round of drinks.  Here's something crazy, just a suggestion, I'm no bar owner or anything.   When the bill comes, could you put my food AND drinks on the same bill? We had 2 bills. 1 for food, 1 for drinks.  Sadly, we got the bill and SAW only the drinks were on there, we were like....awwwww she realizes she's terrible...............and as we stood up, she brought our food bill.   Not a thank you, thanks for coming in, have a good night.....nothing.  I'm guessing the nicotine patch was empty."}
{"text":"Great beer selection!  Even if you don't like beer the dry rub wings are worth the time.  Server was knowledgeable and attentive.  Only downside, flights are 8 oz pours.  Would be better of they dropped down to 4 oz."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was horrible!!!! They were training a new server & the lady training her didn't even check on her. She never put my husbands order in & lied about it. We all had our food except for him. They never even brought my coffee. When we brought it up to the server she said \"well you were never charged for it\". She never apologized for any of it!!!! Like I said good food ...the worst service!!!! I work too hard for my money to go into a place & be treated like that."}
{"text":"Not horrible. Just a lot of little things that weren't good. Waitress told us we have to share a menu because they were out. The place was only 60% full. She wouldn't bring napkins, so the table was wet the whole time from the beer glasses. We had to share silverware because they were out of that as well. The appetizers were good and the waitress was knowledgeable about the beer. Will probably go back."}
{"text":"Have been going here since it opened. Large beer selection for him, daughter rates the Mac and cheese as a 10  1/2 (she uses HOB as the standard) and today I had the most delicious grilled portobello sandwich ever!!"}
{"text":"Way nicer inside than you'd expect. Nice beer selection, comfortable booths, lots of TVs. Typical bar food and some strange table-next-to-booth configurations drops it from 5 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Since the new owners, this place has greatly improved. Much better beer selection (read craft beer), food quality is better, and atmosphere is improved. No longer just a sports bar. Things are a little pricy but the quality if the food justifies the higher prices. Come check it out."}
{"text":"This place CONTINUES to adapt. It's so nice to come in and be constantly surprised. It doesn't always work, but man... their new bbq is phenomenal and Germann is a wonderful new addition too. So to all of you that may not have been impressed the first time, yall gotta come on back to give it another shot!"}
{"text":"We came for the lunch special (half sandwich and side for $6). It was delicious!! I ordered the Blacked Chicken Wrap; the aioli and blackened chicken made this an exceptional wrap! The house mac n cheese was amazing as well. I can't wait to come back and try one of the many craft beers on draft! Would recommend this place to anyone at anytime!"}
{"text":"First time here,   traditional looking sports bar,  clean enough your wife isn't going to turn he nose up (probably) staff seemed nice and helpful.  Not crazy cool, average."}
{"text":"We have been going to HOB for about a year and it quickly became our family's go to restaurant.  With the recent menu change/price increase we are disappointed. My favorite salad is now $12 with no chicken? Buffalo chips, hummus, lettuce wraps, bacon cheeseburger, edamame, prime rib flatbread (THE BEST!), prime rib sliders, (among other favorites) are no longer available?!? $2 extra to change from unhealthy fries to a side salad? It's lettuce people... And not much on the menu under $10, not even the daily specials. HOB was a local bar with affordable food and great beer selection that we frequented at least once a week. Wish they would have kept it that way.  Have to say we were disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Tried two new items tonight and wow! The clams in the sourdough bread bowl are amazing!! I was a little skeptical since this is more of a sports bar than a fine seafood restaurant...but do yourself a favor and try them! You will not be disappointed. Sara was doing a great job taking care of everyone and we always appreciate her service. :) we never have to wait or even ask, she just appears at the right time. We missed our other fave server, Tara, tonight...she's just the best. So if you have a chance to request a table in either of these gals sections, you'll get great service and fun personalities!"}
{"text":"12/17/2015 *****must keep and try: Cheese curds or cheese balls whatever they want to call them.   They're AMAZING.  Flash fried /light batter around mozzarella cheese.   5 star.    An original for the way they're made.  Not the tradition cheese stick, boring.....  They perfected this incredible cheese ball creation.    Kudos to the kitchen!!!    So needs to be an option for 4.5 stars.  But 4 isn't enough because of the recent effort and subsequent change on the wings.  (And I hate doing 5 stars, cause nothing is perfect). However, the wings prior to tonight were subpar at best.  In fact I haven't ordered them in a LONG time, because they just weren't to my liking for a variety of reasons.   It amazed me that the old receipt stayed in play for so long, because wings weren't being ordered on a regular basis.  Not only my decision, but I rarely saw wings go out to other customers tables, etc.   In my opinion a bat should always have wings to fall back in case the customer can't decide.  Wings should be a bars staple food!!!      UPDATE: The staff told me tonight that they made some changes to the way they're prepared and I should try them again.     I'm glad I did.  An obvious and clear change for the better.  I tried the dry rub and the mild. Great favor, the mild was perfect - could even be a medium, it had a small kick but perfect.   I'm so glad I tried the new recipe.   WELL DONE.    Beer selection is always good - staff always friendly - and now I have good wings. :)  Ask for Tara or Sara for great service and solid recommendations.    Wings are Baaaaaack!"}
{"text":"Apparently there's something wrong with the ventilation system in the kitchen... that, or something's on fire... Either way, smoke in the dining room is never good. Our server was awesome and the manager was on the floor checking on everyone, which was cool. The room to the south of the main area has comfy couches. Great place to watch FB!!! Now if I can just stop my eyes from burning...   4 stars for service, # of TVs, sound system and couches :)"}
{"text":"Really, I would give this place 3.5 stars because there were things about our experience that were 5 stars and then things that we about a 2-3 star. Location for me is great, literally a 2 min drive from my house. We walked in and I kid you not, there were 16 TV's plastered all over this place...a sports lovers heaven! Problem is they only had on 1 game. Service was very friendly and attentive, for me 5 stars. The wait time for food was a bit much (25 minutes for burgers) and the burgers for me weren't that good. I ordered my Avocado Burger to be Medium and it came out very well done. It was dry and I didn't end up eating it all. However, the macaroni and cheese was a slam dunk..5 stars! My boyfriend and I couldn't get enough of it! The burgers came with their branding \"HOB\" on top, which I thought was a cool touch. Beers were also ice cold and had a variety to choose from...another sports lovers dream! I would return but not order a burger."}
{"text":"Portions are very nice. Food is pretty good. I have had the club and the wings. Both are great. The Mac and cheese always looks great but I haven't ordered it yet. I work close by and smell the smoker running all the time. Very hard not to get hungry by the smell alone."}
{"text":"Didn't plan on going there today, but a Bratwurst craving drove the car directly to the place.  I ordered Mama's Little Brats off the appetizer menu. I wouldn't call this an appetizer for 1 or 2. It had 3 large brats sitting on a bed of the house kraut with onions and peppers.    The brats were fantastic, lean with an excellent texture that went well with the spicy mustard. A+.  The kraut was an issue for me, it's a house made kraut that didn't have the zing a good German , Jewish or Irish kraut possesses. Very mild. C+  No complaints at all about the service, kept the water glasses full, checked in appropriately to see if we needed anything, very friendly. A+  Let's chat briefly about dessert, I was a bit full for the bread pudding I wanted so I went with the house made Blueberry ice cream. For the price, the portion was great, but the ice cream itself was excellent and chocked full of fresh blueberries. A+.  I will return to try a few other items that caught my eye.  Henry"}
{"text":"Love the TVs and that they take reservations on Football Sundays...  The service is so slow...  You may end up eating limb before getting waited on. Sometimes they have sewer issues and the bar smells awful."}
{"text":"If your looking for a neighborhood restaurant with awesome food, many choices of craft beers and exceptional service, this is the place.  The staff really cares about your experience and goes above and beyond to make sure you leave happy and you will want to come back.  Thanks Josh, Tim and Aaron.  You guys rock."}
{"text":"So my wife and i like this place at first but it has gone down hill since the first two times we came here. The first two times the food and customer service was great they treated us very nicely and we also have a 16 month old and they were very friendly with him and also went above an beyond to cater to him. Then my wife and I went there a third time and the food was not as good as the first two times but not horrible and the customer service was not as great as it had been. Then we went a fourth time and I got the \"special\" it was a Gnocchi plate which is my favorite pasta and it came and was a puny helping my wife got a burger and a side of Macaroni and Cheese her side was bigger than my dish which was kind of ridiculous. So we decided to take a hiatus since but felt compelled to go on 3-2-14 because well a beer sounded good and figured we would try again. Well that was the wrong thing to do, so our server was busy at first so someone else helped us and she was great I wish she would have been our server she was playing with our son and talking to him. Then our server took over it seemed like he had not served much we ordered our food and we asked for specific things to not be on our meals and how the meals were to be cooked. So after our order was taken our son was starting to get antsy so we just asked for some crackers to tide him over and our server said sure but i will have to charge you, charge me for crackers???? really crackers???? in our first two outings the servers brought our son puffs and apple sauce out of kindness no charge and this guy is charging for crackers come on man! So after the cracker debaucle we get our food well my wife's burger is over cooked and the fries are blah and my chicken sandwich is not how i asked for it we just ate the food because we did not want to be there any longer. So then we get our bill (yes the crackers were there) and they have a neat thing where they put the bill in a novel not a normal fold, well this book was filled with graffitti now I am not a prude by any means but why are we given a book that has pornographic images and language that would make a sailor blush. I am sorry but what if a kid opened this book up I cannot believe management would allow this if that were seen by the wrong person i am sure one of the local news channels could be called I will not be back  2 stars is for the first two visits if i were to judge on newer vists it would be 1"}
{"text":"best place in valley to watch sports. been watching march madness!!"}
{"text":"Got a recommendation of what to order, but the food came out cold  2x .... Then server forgot my  beer order ... cool looking spot, good menu, but didn't execute on meal or food quality"}
{"text":"Somethings gone wrong here.... My wife and I live within walking distance and this used to be our favorite for dinner. Really good service, good to great food and great beer. In the past year everything is going down hill and we don't know why - guessing changes in management or something related. The last three visits the pub smells like a sewer the moment you walk in. Some areas are worse than others but you can smell it everywhere. I'm guessing they have problems with their grease disposal. Service ranges from ok to simply ignoring customers. None of the warm conversation and natural smiles we got used to in prior years. We'd love it to be \"our place\" again so we stop by occasionally hoping something has changed but each time we walk in the door we can tell from the smell and the lack of assistance that nothing has changed. Really sad - this used to be a place we'd tell others about. Now I'd be embarrassed to bring friends."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for awhile. First we asked for a beer menu and they told us we had to check the website for it. We ordered our food and the kids food came out but not ours. Our kid's were done eating when ours finally arrived. My salad was wilted, no dressing and they forgot the grilled chicken. I told the waitress and she brought out the chicken and dressing. Chicken was tasteless and the dressing tasted like old olive oil. My husband's last chicken wings was raw when he bit into it.   They took the salad off the bill. Then waitress was nice and apologetic but the kitchen needs help. We were beyond unimpressed with the food. It took to long for raw, tasteless food and over priced food. If we ever go back it will be just for the beer."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place...All the staff were friendly. .never seen so many beers..wow...plenty of tv's..had some nachos were pretty good..good tables. .I would definitely come back.."}
{"text":"This place is great! It was my first time a couple nights ago after a friend recommended this establishment. It's such a chill place to hang out and drink. There's tv everywhere that all has some sort of sports channel on. Their beer collection is pretty extensive, I think there was over 50 beers or so on tap. The food menu and dessert menu is kind of small, but the food portion is huge!!! I ordered the fish and chips and substituted for onion rings instead. The fish was excellent. I went to London to have real fish and chips and have been looking for a place that was somewhat close to London and this is the place. Although, I wouldn't order the onion rings again, the batter on it doesn't really stick so you're eating more onion than you are batter. I will probably order the sweet potato fries, stole a couple of them off of my bf plate and it was delicious. Overall, food is great, drinks are great. Will come again!"}
{"text":"This place was incredible!!! Reasonably priced and fast service! I got the Mac and cheese and my fiancé got the fried tomato BLT. Both exceeded expectations. We also shared the fried pickle appetizer with friends which were fried to perfection and served with a unique house cumber sauce. Our friends got fried cookie dough rolls which were a fantastic finish to the meal. Add to it a wide selection flog brews both local and national and you have a fantastic meal! We read about the Sunday breakfast and a free Bloody Mary with each breakfast entree we will definetly be back to try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great food... love the atmosphere ... Ask for Alex as a waitress ... Personable fun and great person!  Great smile !!!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and great new food menu!  If you are looking to watch a game it is a great place. Try the Mac n Cheese!"}
{"text":"Good place for beer, but the food?  Not so much  It was good in the beginning, but now, not at all.  Surprised they are still around, but like I said with the great selection of beers on tap, it is evident that folks are not there for a gourmet meal."}
{"text":"Still strictly average.  Sigh.  I so wanted them to rebound.  But just ordered their flagship Mac and cheese with bacon and hamburger.  Found it overly greasy from the meats not being drained properly.  On the plus side they had an excellent cherry cider on tap!  Miss the old menu variety."}
{"text":"Some food was awesome some food was just ok, great beer selection. Manager seemed very green and there was no pre bussing of our table i.e. All the plates and empty glasses just chilled on the table"}
{"text":"House of Brews is amazing! I had the best service by Robert bar tending and Bo!  Not only do they have so many amazing beers to choose from but they also have Great food!!!!! I would recommend this place to anyone! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Service was mediocre. Server did her best, considering she had about 20-25 tables to serve by herself. There is only so much one person can do. Nonetheless, she was pleasant and did what she could. Management, Dan I think his name is, was absolutely atrocious. He blamed the server for his mistakes twice. He told us he would comp our beers as they didn't have what we ordered (told us about 15-20 mins later). I believe that was his/ management error for not doing the ordering. Then he blamed her for not taking off the beers that he told us he would comp. He attempted to blame the server and give us a $15 ucredit for the next visit for her \"screw up.\" Needless to say we gave it to the server. After letting him know that he was in the wrong for blaming the server his response was \"ok\" and he abruptly walked away. Clearly this man has limited management skills. He was clearly too involved with his hair and its positioning to be concerned with his staff and guests. We would not go back here even with a free bill. No thanks. Shame for the poor servers who have to work under this management team."}
{"text":"Used to frequent this place quite often. Very close to home, good music and good beer. Saddens me that my first review has to be a negative one. We ordered 2 flights, one for my girlfriend and I. Thats four samplers each , eight total. Two very nice girls took our order the first time but after several further attempts to get our order, we were brought 7 samplers.. The appetizer came and it was ok but we were hungry. After a couple minutes it was evident that the beer in the flights did not coincide with the list provided to us (it was easy tell because we had a cherry, blueberry, and a duplicate order of a third beer that were very distinguishable). We decided to just drink whatever was in front of us and eat the food so we could leave. When the bill came we were charged for 8 samplers. When we told the waitress, she proceeded to check mark each beer on the receipt and follow it up with \"so which one are you missing?\" We told her that we clearly only had seven glasses in front of us, and considering there was no cohesive order to the beer, we did not know which one was missing.   Ultimately; it's sad that the service and atmosphere has completely changed (and not for the better). I most likely will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"We were looking to take our son, who was turning 21, out for his first legal drink. Given that there aren't many places in Gilbert that are open past midnight, we decided to try House of Brews, and we're so glad we did. The place was practically empty, but the bartender and our server were so friendly and welcoming. The bartender gave our son a complimentary \"Flaming Dr. Pepper\" to be consumed the moment midnight came and he turned 21. It was so strong it made his eyes water, but it was such a sweet thing to do. All in all we loved this place, and we'll definitely visit again in the future."}
{"text":"We always enjoy our overall experience here. The staff is friendly and the beer selection is awesome and the new menu is pretty impressive. Trivia on Wednesday nights is always fun. If you haven't been recently, I'd suggest another go. Great after work or Sunday game hang out."}
{"text":"Good beer selection but we've had some of the poorest service here.  Last time we were there it was just so-so; we won't be back."}
{"text":"Here's a few tips and reason you'd actually come here...  1. You want lack luster frozen to deep fryer foods.   2. You want to be seated and then left alone.   3. You want to feel like you're single handedly ruining and interrupting the server/bar tenders social hour.   We had the worst service ever here. We went to celebrate my friends birthday and we saw our waitress twice. She didn't even bring us the check. We went to the bar to close out. It was also incredibly slow, strange for a Friday night.  We've been in there once before when the owners were there. Thankfully they don't care about their patrons, it'd be a shame if their pocketbooks weren't heavily lined. It's sad to see such disrespect from owners who forget why their in business in the first place. Almost makes me understand why their staff is so awful."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly attentive waitresses, and a great selection of beers on tap.  If I lived closer id be there all the time! Haha There are plenty of nice size tv's too if you are there for games."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the pretzel tray!!  Great spot for a date night appetizer! The wait staff were attentive and worked well together to make sure our experience was well received."}
{"text":"Tim has done a remarkable job total 180 great food ice cold beer and huge selection! My new fav place"}
{"text":"Still a last resort. Pricey, service spotty and mediocre food. This place lacks identity."}
{"text":"Beers were great.  Nachos not so much.  I was a big fan of the HOB prior to it closing and reopening.  Chris (our waiter) was very friendly, helpful and generally great.  However the nachos left alot to be desired.  There was both cheese sauce and cheese on them.  Super weird.  The steak was of much poorer quality than when I used to frequent House of Brews.  I am hoping with was a 1 off bad experience.  I plan on going back but next time ordering something different."}
{"text":"I don't usually create reviews, but...  Had lunch here for the first time and it was terrible.  Asked for the burger to be cooked medium and received a well done burger.  Tastes like rubber.  Received our appetizer within 20 mins and the meal within 2 mins after the appetizer.  Had to send back the appetizer.  The waiter mixed up our meal with the other tables meal.  I overheard her send back the sandwich we ordered.  This place is not busy and there is no excuse for it.  I am disappointed and will not return.  I'm sure their doors will close if they don't change their business."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I am seriously impressed.  It's amazing that it's not more busy.  The bbq is out of this world.  The beer menu is outstanding.  The service is so friendly.  You have to try the bbq pork sliders."}
{"text":"49 taps. Game day menu clams is so simple and yummy. They're fried cheese curds are pretty good too!!"}
{"text":"Awesome baked mac n cheese.  Don't go on trivia night unless you like loud.  And I mean *really* loud.    We have been quite a few times and the service is always great, the food is always good, and the beer is always cold.  No complaints - just not the extra pizazz that warrants a 5th star.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to get a craft brew and watch a game.  Parking is easy and it has never been very crowded when I've went. Food is just average.  Customer service is decent."}
{"text":"The place is brand new so I will have to come back to see if there are signs of improvement. The menu is very ecclectic, with everything from your standard bar nachos, burgers to mussels and prime rib. Some of the food seemed fairly priced while others seemed a little high, burgers for example were pretty much all over $10   The food was just ok, nothing special but they are new so kind of giving them the benefit of the doubt but for the prices they will need to step it up a notch.  The decor is spartan but clean, not sure what the theme is that they are trying to accomplish, layout looks much more like a casual diner than a bar or upscale restaurant.  Now my big beef.  If you are going to call yourself House of Brews the focus should be on the beer, which it clearly is not. Some local distributors sold them a bill of goods.  They have a pretty decent size beer list but the bad thing is they are wasting a number of taps on beers that tastes alike, Victoria, Budweiser and Coors Light, Stella Artrois and Redhook? Come on now, you only need one bland beer, and 2 ciders? Really., Give the people of Gibert some credit. Only one SanTan beer on but 4 Four Peaks beers, that's not fair. All the other beers were also just very pedestrian. It wouldn't take much like having 1 beer knowledgeable person on staff to revamp that list and make the beer stand out instead of just becoming known for a place that buys the cheapest beer from the distributors that they can.  When I go back instead of ordering an everyday meaningless beer I'll take a water or a coke unless they change it up.  I'm sure people in Gilbert want to have a place to go for beer that is on par with places in nearby Chandler, Tempe and Scottsdale. So far this isn't it."}
{"text":"Been to house a few times and have eaten there twice. I wish I could get separate stars for just the food and beer because it would be a solid 4 stars. Good burgers and wings and the beer selection is amazing. The only downside I would have to say is the patrons, they seem to have a lot of regulars at this place and kinda sketchy characters. Place looks like a strip club from the outside as well. The staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was better than expected. Shanna checked in on us several times to see if everything was ok, and if we needed anything. Can't say that for most places we eat at!"}
{"text":"After a few visits to HOB, my experiences can be summarized: great craft selection, decent food, decent service and reasonable prices.  Until my most recent visit, there have been only a few occasions that I have requested to try a new beer and it was out. However, when I invited several of my friends to dinner on a Saturday night the experience was much different. Many of the selections were tapped out and it was difficult for the waitress to know which ones would be available.  During busy times, the wait for beer can seem a bit long. But, the waiters were great about letting us know if there was a big group in the back. Also, because the beer would fluctuate on availability, this would cause a lot of back and forth visits to tables. All around the waiters and bartenders have been very kind and patient.  Food is pretty good. I will have to agree with other reviews: it seems impossible to get your burgers cooked as requested. A friend and I ordered medium well and the meat was cooked to a crisp. BUT! The baked mac and cheese--- oh my gosh!!! So good!!!!! I would forgo any of the burgers just to have the baked mac and cheese.  Price is reasonable for the food and beer selection-- provided you get your correct order and they have available beers.  Okay I admit it. . . . I am just disappointed that the one time I want to show this place off to my friends they really let me down with the selection :( If it weren't for this thorn in my side- I would give 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Kind of dive/sports bar with a solid selection of craft beer.  Service was good, but the food menu & quality left a lot to be desired.  The good selection of beers comes at a price here, many in the $7 + category.  I'd recommend it if you want to watch a game, aren't hungry and don't mind paying a bit of a premium for good beer."}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to try a new place. Lately we've been hitting up some breweries, and this one is reasonably close to home, so we thought why not.  The good: Beer list was extensive and served cold. Mac & Cheese was alright. Waitress was nice. Wife thought the burger was OK. Lots of TVs you could easily see to watch several things at once.  The bad: The first beer we ordered was not available (San Tan Epicenter). The Mac & Cheese was only good if you ate the warmer part on the inside, because the outside was cold and hard as if it had been sitting for quite a while. Took a long time to initially get a waiter to our table and was very slow to return each time. The bread that came out with the Mac & Cheese was literally burnt black. The waitress offered to bring out non-burnt bread but never actually brought any out. We were never asked how our meals were.   As a place to dine, I would not return here and recommend anyone else against considering eating here. I would however consider returning here if I wanted to drink beers and watch a game, which may yield a different experience."}
{"text":"Horrible. The server was one of those \"I'm not going to write your order down, I'll remember it\" types. Guess what, screwed up the whole order. Messed up the salads. That took 10 minutes to get fixed. Just in time for the entree to get there. I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon and cheddar. Shows up with American. I ask the server, if it's American and he confirms. I remind him that I ordered cheddar. This guy had the nerve to walk back into the kitchen and then come back telling me it was cheddar. Straight up lying to my face. He also thought it was appropriate the deliver items to the table while talking on his cell phone. Focus on your customer. I will never step foot in that place again and will tell everyone I know not to go there."}
{"text":"So I'd love to write a great review but I'm elsewhere eating dinner and drinking beers. Why? Because my friend and I (both women) could not justify paying a $5 cover to see a fight that 1. We could careless about. 2. Could see up the street for free 3. Could have parked in the parking lot and watched. So, sorry to say we will be spending our money and tipping well here at Gordon Biersch."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  1. Let's talk about Katrina! She is great!!! Her hair is awesome and fun! Best server ever!!! Come here and see her for some great service!!!  2. The food is delish. Have had lots of things. Mac and cheese is my favorite.  3. Beer selection is on point.  Bottom line..... Come to HOB!!!  4. Dan the manager is also super nice."}
{"text":"I have now been here several times, and the food and service has been consistent which to me is a very good thing. HOB Benedict might just be the best breakfast I have ever eaten!"}
{"text":"This place use to be a great neighborhood bar, however now it is trash now! The food is not bar food and I swear it it is frozen and not a scratch kitchen anymore. The management is lack luster at best. One of the biggest nights for a sports bar....football playoffs and they were not prepared at all. What's with not having enough menus and having to ask different tables to share so they can give \"your\" menu to another table. Watching the \"money\" that place could have earned last night walk right out the door was sad and all because they were not prepared. I am not even sure if they had a manager on site last night. If they did they were no where to be seen. The owners should be ashamed of taking this place that use to be \"The Place To Be\" to \"The Place To Avoid\" to bad."}
{"text":"They have good variety on their menu and the food tastes great - especially the Mac and cheese! Excellent service and a great atmosphere round out his neighborhood restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wow...this place has really gone down. New menu and chef...very sad. Meat pie was burnt on top raw, on bottom, liquids in middle.  Very disappointed. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Came in service was horrible, asked a very simple question do you guys have a happy hour menu and was told \"I don't know I can ask\" by the hostess my wife and I were looking for a new place this will not be it!"}
{"text":"The love and I came here for dinner one evening. It's basically down the street from my house.  Score!   I wish I would've written this review earlier so I can remember all the little details. I think they're known for their mac and cheese because they have 6 different mac and cheese dishes but I ended up ordering  the fish sandwich since I couldn't eat meat this day. The beer battered fish that came in the sandwich was huge! It was bigger than the actual sandwich! It was quite tasty. I also got a side of the mac and cheese (without meat of course) which was reallyyyyy good. The only downfall was the sandwich was soooo messy! Everything came apart. When I told the waiter he said it's better to order the fish and chips. It's basically the same exact thing and less messy. & you can order bread with it if you really wanted to.   They had live music when we came and it was extremely loud so we ended up sitting on their patio. The waiter was great and was very attentive. He always made sure we had everything we needed. They also have different specials each day of the week too. I'll definitely be back to try their other mac and cheese dishes!!"}
{"text":"I had driven past HOB several times and finally decided to give it a shot. I was amazed at how busy it was since it's in a shopping center that doesn't really have anything else going for it.   I was impressed with how many good craft beers they had on their list, they even had hop slam which was hard to come by. You could tell the waitress had a huge workload but still provided good service and my glass was never empty. Tim, one of the managers, made his way by every table asking how the service was and if there was anything they could do better.    They have a very diverse selection of food and the blackened chicken wrap I ordered did not disappoint. Ever since Boombozz switched to american tap house I have been looking for a new place. House of Brews is definitely it!"}
{"text":"This place was sooo good at one time...then they went and changed their menu.   With the new management, changed menu and HORRIBLE service this place is no longer worth the drive. We live a half a mile away, just to give you an idea..."}
{"text":"Great beers. Great food. Great ambiance. Server Katrina was awesome - her aqua blue hair encourages big money spending. Ya hear, Dan?"}
{"text":"Terrible. My \"medium rare\" burger was charred & tasted like it was cooked on a very dirty grill. The ruben did not have any sauce, and it should have something. The service was horrible. We had to flag down 2 other waiters because we couldn't find ours. To top it off, all 6 of us felt really bad the evening following our meal. I wouldn't eat here again. Their beer list is good, but there are enough beer bars in the area with good food that this one should be avoided. And it was HOT inside. Another couple even walked in and mentioned the heat and walked out. Just bad all the way around."}
{"text":"I really like this place. They always have a good selection of craft brews. I love there boneless chicken wings, specifically the teriyaki. Pretzel board is good except for the cheese, it tastes like meat.... Kind of like a bunch of lil' smokies were cooked in it. ruins the cheese if you'd ask me. I do come here often. The music is good and there are a lot of tv's. Don't get the ribs tips... Or a side of veggies.... But like I said I do like this place and plan on coming back"}
{"text":"Love Sarah our waitress. Sheet knows her beers and her opinion is spot on. Friendly and fun as well. The kinda stuff that ices the cake.   Food is wonderful now. The wings are excellent and now that they smoke their meat, it's a great touch. So good. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I like Sports Bars for a couple simplistic reasons. The sports and the bar. So. Came here for lunch the other day and when I arrived at 11:45, it was DEAD. Like literally I was the only one there. But that's fine with me. (It filled up as the lunch hour approached) The bartender was friendly and when the tap for the beer I wanted broke, she was sweet and apologetic and recommended another beer that I might like while they replaced the keg. They didn't have Guinness or Blue Moon, Shocktop was the one that broke, so I went with the Hangar 24 Orange Wheat and it was good! The service for ordering and food was a little slow but nothing really to complain about. I watched Superbike Championships, ESPN and some spring training-no shortage of TVs. The menu was ok, not any more or less than a typical bar type menu. I had a chicken ceasar wrap and it was pretty good. The parking lot has a lot of construction and it's not in a very busy or popular shopping pad so my hunch is that they don't get a lot of business. But for a work lunch or to hang out and watch a game it's a pretty decent place. Not winning any Best Of awards or anything but the waitress/bartender I had was pleasant and upbeat and that works for me!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. The food is bland. No flavor at all. I should have kept driving and gone to McDonald's.   Also, The amount of bugs flying around is unacceptable. It makes me wonder what it is like in the kitchen. I spent my meal fighting off flies and other flying bugs (not sure what they were... Baby flies? Maggots with wings? Who knows?)   Overall disgusting experience and just waiting on the food poisoning to kick in.... I'm certain it is coming...  Only good thing is there are good beers..."}
{"text":"Best tenders on my watch. Best beer selection; loving the two brothers and Arizona products... Great people and a wonderful vibe."}
{"text":"I was very surprised how good this place was. Obviously a local favorite judging by the patrons. All seemed to know each other and having a good time.  This will become one of my local stops for sure."}
{"text":"Ok so my first experience with this place was in the summer of 2012 all I could say was fail.   It's been almost 2 years and was near and had about two hours to kill..read some positive reviws and said why not I heard they had redone the place and had new owners.  Well I am glad I did.   Beer selection is great had a few great choices for me and the wife as we are on opposite sides of the beer spectrum.  Now the food. ..I would have say very interesting menu.   I went for the black and blue burger.  Is it good when the juices are running down your arm?  Uhhh ya... Cooked to requested temp.  Nice.   The wife had their Nan bread Flatbread, pretty tasty also. I was not that impressed with the fried pickles.. but no doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"I'm pretty much done with this place, except that a few friends do drag me in on occasion.  They never have the first three beers I select -- sorry, we're out of that one (even though their beer guy is totally awesome which then points to management/ownership). If you don't have it, take it off the list! The service is terrible three out of four times (like Hertz) -- while that 1 out of 4 times is really good service.  The last time I was there, I ordered the ribs. Oh my god they were terrible! First, no BBQ sauce. Do you have sauce? Oh, do you want that? Yeah! Then, the ribs also include the 'tail' part of the ribs with  the bone pieces and cartilage. Yuck. And, it was chewy/tough, not tender. Man, was that horrible. I think, given that nobody else'd serve ribs that bad, these will be the worst ribs I will have ever had.  The wings have a really weird taste. Cumin, maybe? Trying to be original, but it just comes off as weird.  The fries are good fries, but they under cook them and hit them with cracked pepper. Not to my taste.  Skip this joint. Too many good places around to waste your time/money here (Blue32, Teakwoods, even B-dubs)."}
