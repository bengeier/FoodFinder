{"text":"Phenomenal, authentic Thai food.  Only place as good in the Valley is Thai Buffet and American Sandwiches.  To those who rated this place lowly, I feel sad for your tongue and pray you have no children to which you impart your palette."}
{"text":"its good... a little bland. its cheep. the food is hot and decent.lunch prices are great. lots of food."}
{"text":"I went here in the late afternoon and there wasn't anyone else in the restaurant which is exactly how I like it. I had the som tom and Thai beef jerky with sticky rice ... I was thoroughly satisfied with my meal! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I can't think of any reason to give them four stars. Had the papaya salad, beef jerky and crispy pork.....all were excellent!  The service by the young lady was exceptional. The interior and exterior were a little shabby but that had never bothered me.  Oh, the Thai iced coffee was awesome, def try that."}
{"text":"Been eating at Royal Thai ever it opened maybe 12 years ago.  LOVE it.  The owners are wonderful and the food is FANTASTIC!     They always ask you how spicy you want it.  The menu choices include your choice of meat.  If you don't want any meat you can choose that also.  Just about everything is made to order.  You can order from the menu are order one of the lunch or dinner specials.  The owners always greet us warmly and are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this place a try since it was near work and I love Thai Curry.  It was eh.  First, the soup was really bad, brown rotini noodles, brown broth, very unappetizing.  I ordered the beef curry lunch special.  Not much beef a TON of bamboo shoots, some sauce and fried rice.  The sauce was ok.   Next time I'm looking for Thai Curry near work, I'll search for somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was in the area saw it had 4 starts and decided to give it a shot. Reality the food is alright, however very bland. It does come out very fast which makes you wonder. The price is very cheap with a good amount of food for only $5.95 for lunch though. I probably wouldn't eat here again, but it was better option than Rally's, McDonald's or my work cafeteria."}
{"text":"This place is my go to spot for Thai food.  Yes, it's a hole in the wall and yes, there's a good possible chance that the family lives there, but don't let that turn you away... Don't even let the unapproachable Thai owner stand in your way.  Oh and don't even look at their lunch and dinner special menu hanging on the wall... Just don't do it!  They have certain dishes that they cook very well and they're not on that menu.  We stick to same dishes every time and have never been disappointed: beef jerky, pad see ew with beef, pad gra prow with pork, glass noodle salad, and Thai tea!  Their Thai tea is so damn good. Skip the boba houses and just come here to satisfy your craving.  The Penang and papaya salad is pretty tasty as well.  Pad Thai... Ehh.. Not so much. Skip it like you would skip the lunch/dinner special menu.  You'll definitely get great food here if you order the right food.  Don't come here for the Chinese food and then complain how this THAI restaurant sucks. It just doesn't make sense."}
{"text":"This is the only authentic Thai place here in AZ!  I've tried other Thai places around the valley and nothing compares to this place.  Even though it's in a rundown area/plaza, it's worth eating here.  I love the pad see ew, pad thai, papaya salad, beef jerky, and best of all...Thai ice tea!!  The owner is from Thailand and is very friendly.  Even though it's a bit hard to understand him, he's pretty funny!"}
{"text":"I love the Royal Thai and am never disappointed in my meals there... Although I wish they would kick up the heat level on spicy Thai #5 a bit!  I'm a big fan of their curry when it's spiked with a little Pepper Palace ghost pepper powder... I always keep it in my pocket in case I go out. Here it is the perfect marriage to knock the Curry or Mongolian Beef into orbit!  I alway tip big when picking up or dining in because I want to continue to enjoy such great Thai, so fast & convenient! I love it because it is a Mom & Pop business... Mom's in back cooking! Dads up front!"}
{"text":"Went here for this first time tonight and everything was DELICIOUS.  The price is definitely right too, especially for two medical school students! You must check out this hidden gem!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Yelp doesn't lie.  First time here. Ordered shrimp  Pad Thai (I always order pad Thai when I get Thai food) and No. 1 sweet sour chicken... very good.  The chicken was tender.  Huge portions.  Both dishes Very flavorible.  The restaurant is hard to see on the south side of mckellips. It is adjacent to the liquor store/convenience store opposite side, the south side of mckellips."}
{"text":"Great Thai food!  I've spent a lot of time in Thailand and this is as good as it gets.  Authentic, tasty and served with enthusiasm by the owner and his family.  You can't go wrong with the lunch specials, and they will make it \"crazy falang\" hot if you ask. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"I grew up in a Vietnamese/Loa/Thai family. the food at this place is reminiscent of the Thai food my family made when i was younger.  don't come here expecting the same customer service as other American restaurant because you will be disappointed  - the owner is Thai and his English is only good enough to take your order.  so if you want amazing service and non-traditional Thai food - then go to an Americanized Thai Restaurant like The Mint or Malees. if you can deal with ok service and want good - authentic Thai food - then come here.  and FYI - if you order it medium - it will be super spicy because so order 2 or 2.5 if you want it spicy"}
{"text":"Never got disappointed! Pork jerky is my all time favorite.As well as Larb pork. Super friendly owners, both wife and husband. Freshly daily made sticky rice which is very rare in AZ. Check them out"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I had the red curry which was the best I've had in the valley- and only $7.50 during dinner special hours. They were quick and polite and brought our soup, water, and limes while we waited.  The husband and wife duo were adorable. You can eat in or takeout. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good amount of delicious Thai!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this restaurant weekly when I used to work in the area.  However, since I have come back, I have noticed the place has really gone down hill. In need of a serious face lift.  Reading the health reports online has made me question it as well. I wouldn't say I would not come back, I would just look at other Thai restaurants nearby first."}
{"text":"Nancy and Art are the REAL DEAL! Authentic Thai food, big selection and old school.   We've had quite a few options, the panang curry, rich and creamy with lots of vegetables. The pad Thai was really nice too, I should've asked for spicier but the shrimp was on point. Try the coconut soup, it's delicious. The best thing they've got though is the pork jerky, like meat candy! Also, they hook it up and the price is RIGHT!  Again, it's old school. It's not about the decor and they don't know anything about technology, they're just honest people who make great food and are really nice. Art is hilarious if you get a chance to talk with him!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with average food. Went for lunch and it's pretty much what you expect from the exterior of the restaurant. Service was quick but with a lack of friendly demeanour."}
{"text":"After two weeks in Thailand this is one of the few places in the valley that are still good.  Great food with a hint of Lao for those who would know the difference.  And as a note to the one two star review they're Thai they aren't exactly the most vegetarian friendly of genres and having to choose between service and good food I choose good authentic food every time."}
{"text":"Panang curry was the most perfect level of spice but only consisted of chicken. No other vegetables, which I found odd. Not enough broth with the chicken to sop up the rice. Tried the beef jerky that everyone talks about. I dunno what the hype is. This place is okay... Not my top choice for Thai."}
{"text":"We saw the chef dump used chili sauce back into the container on the table after the customers left. Bleh :("}
{"text":"I don't know how they have a lot of good reviews. The service is blah. The food comes out quick, taste bland. Bad location. The place looks filthy."}
{"text":"I wish I could give no star for this place. The old man, I guess he is the owner is so rude. We plan to have dinner there cause my fianc√© been there and he loves the food. But We haven't even ordered anything then we decide to leave cause I can't stand the way he talks to me when I ask him simple questions about food and drinks, like what he has and what kind of fish? That's all 2 questions. Do u know what he tells me?? \" do not ask!! Get whatever we have here!!\" That's it!! We will never go back!#"}
{"text":"It takes a little bit to understand the owner but this is one of my favorite places to eat. Lunch prices are great and u get a lot of food."}
{"text":"This is the best authentic thai place in arizona.  Hands down.  try the papaya salad w/ crab. pad see eww is good too.  one thing that isn't on the menu that you can order is the beef jerky, the name doesn't do it justice but if you know about thai food you'll thank me later.  it's really one of those hole in the wall places and everyone knows that's where teh good food really are.  because of the location it really doesn't get as much traffic as it should."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to me.  I just wasn't that impressed.  Went for lunch on Sunday.  The place was empty except for one other couple that came in as we were getting ready to leave.    The service was really bad.  We were ignored for about 5 minutes after coming in and sitting down.  Our drinks and food were all served promplty  but with no smile or friendliness.  The menu was a list of specials hanging all over the walls.  The only vegetarian option was Green Curry so I ordered that.  The soup came out first and had brown curly noodles in it as well as chunks of small brown pieces of chicken.  Two of my kids liked it but I couldn't try it.  Lunch was served with fried rice instead of white or brown and I wasn't a fan of that.  The egg roll also had meat so I couldn't try that.  My girls shared the chicken teriyaki and were not impressed.  The fried pieces of wonton were the most popular part of the meal.  My son had the red beef curry and enjoyed it.  So did my husband.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I have travelled to Thailand for years on business.  This restaurant is as authentic as you can get in the US.   Food is excellent and the experience is unique.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"this is the best thai food place in the valley.  period.  other kitchens come here to learn and guess their food contents and how to cook it.  trust me, i been to sawadee, thai rama, the old char thai, malee, yuphas, thai paradise.  if u talk to the owner, he can tell u that sawadee's owner and chef started coming the longest, thus their food come in as number 2 behind this place.  the rest are still trying.  if u want noodles, order this \"kim-mao\" or tell the owner, drunken noodles.  its not on the menu but its very good.  oh, it can be quite spicy, so if u dun like it too hot, let them know.   An alternative for the noodles will be pad see yew, which is also rice noodles, but this one with dark sweet soy sauce.  i dun need to tell u abt their good curries, just order them and try them.  do order their pork with mint leaves.  its got an interesting flavor and very tasty :)"}
{"text":"Literally best Thai food around for the price. I always get the Pad Thai, the Pad see ewe, lemon chicken, or drunken noodles. The lunch special comes with a soup, fried rice, egg roll, and whatever noodles you order for less than 6$. I love the guys personality and how homey it is inside. I am not a big meat lover so I always order vegetable (egg ok) and they have some high quality vegetables. I love this place and would go once a week if I wasn't a poor college student living off ramen."}
{"text":"This place is really good and super affordable. The owner is super funny! The Panang Beef and the Larb Salad were excellent.  A little hole in the wall worth coming to."}
{"text":"It's apparent there is some secret password for great food or something. People that had good food here, what's the secret? Is there a secret menu? It's really odd that all the reviews are either really good or really bad, with none that are mediocre.  I gave this place another shot and ordered crispy pork with chinese broccoli. When I saw it on the menu I was doing the happy dance. I usually order this at the local thai  places in LA, it's so good. A dish that is pretty simple but amazing when cooked right. When I ordered this, the owner was surprised and asked if I was Thai (which I am not, but I am asian and grew up in LA so I've had more than my fair share of thai food).. I was thinking oh yeah, he got intrigued by my order... this is going to be legit.   What the hell! The pork was not crispy at all! The hugest let down ever. There is nothing worst than chewy, rubbery pork belly especially when it is meant to be crispy.    I know all you loyal customers are thinking... whatever she does not know thai food and is not ordering the right stuff. Blah, blah... but I'm sorry, any Thai restaurant should have Pad Thai down, at the very least.   Fooled me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me!  P.S. I'm really convinced that there is a secret menu because the Pad Thai I described in my previous post did not look the very least like the one in the photo that someone posted here!"}
{"text":"I am not sure why there are so many super positive reviews for this place.  It is average at best.  The waiter did not understand anything I was saying or asking, which on one hand constitutes a traditional Asian place, but in this instance just made the service mediocre.    For instance, due to major communication problems he wound up bringing me the wrong food and never asked how \"hot\" we wanted anything.  Also, there is a full menu that I read online (the reason I went there) and saw that it had some good stuff.  I saw this menu sitting on the counter in the restaurant, however we were never given the full menu and had to order from the small special menu posted on the walls which had about 15 things; mostly basic Chinese dishes like Sweet and Sour pork or Teriyaki Chicken which is not very \"Thai\".  My wife was able to get Chicken Pad Thai (one of my favorites) and it was fine, but nothing special.  He also refused to make my young daughter plain Thai noodles (she doesn't eat anything that is not plain) and was forced to order one of the full entrees on the wall menu that she did not want.    In the end the price was right and the food was okay (but nothing special), but the fact that the service completely sucked to the point where I got the wrong order and my daughter got something she would not eat, makes it so we will never go back."}
{"text":"I love Thai food. Here is authentic Thai food. You can't find many authentic Thai food in USA. The most of Thai restaurant change to American style. They take care customers like a family. the food is big potions , cheap price and very delicious."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall is now my family's Thai food gem.   Ambiance: Don't go in with any high expectations. The tables are haphazardly placed. They use the dining area as a storage as well. However, it's clean.   Service: This is the hilarity. The man who runs the place is quite eccentric but very nice. The food is always coming out quick and hot, which is my biggest preference.   Food: Legit. Everything tastes fresh and light. It's not greasy which is hard to find nowadays. Even my kid likes it which she's pretty picky.   Best part....prices: They're almost giving it away. They have a set number of options at really cheap prices. For a family of three, we never spend over $30 including tip."}
{"text":"Quaint restaurant, looks little raggedy from outside but the food is phenomenal. Their curry is delicious and the sticky rice is one of a kind. 10/10 could come back."}
{"text":"I ordered the pad Thai and I was unsatisfied with the meal. The noodles tasted like fish and the egg roll had a weird taste also I've had pad Thai at many other places but this was just disgusting. I won't be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"We went here at an odd time (3-ish) and we were greeted with a smile. Every dish we tried was delicious. Garlic chicken, pepper steak, Szechwan chicken, and beef curry were all distinctly different and excellent. The curry is authentically spicy and full of flavorful ginger, basil, and lemongrass. This place is a treasure."}
{"text":"This is my favorite thai place! Super close Always delicious either delivery or dine in rocks. Run by the owner and his wife. Very delcious every time."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The owners are funny and nice.  Good food with a cold thai beer makes this place my go to spot.  This place isn't for the cookie cutter types.  This is where you come for the real."}
{"text":"This thai restaurant is so super authentic my mom and I often eat here and we absolutely love it. My favorite part is that it tastes like real thai food and you can really taste the herbs and spices used! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Just okay. A small very dated restaurant.. a little dingy inside. The food had large portions for the price but just okay taste quality. I was a little disappointed! I do not think we will return. This was our first visit and impressions are everything!!!"}
{"text":"This was chinese food, which was a total surprise, since it is called a Thai Grill. I ordered kung pao chicken, which wasn't spicy at all and kind of bland. My wife had the lemon chicken which was pretty good, but not great. I was pretty disappointed that the only Thai food on the menu was pad thai. Oh well. It was worth a shot. The fellow who worked there was quite a character, and was fun."}
{"text":"Best Thai in the Valley.  Small mom and pop shop.  Must haves are the beef sticks, pad Thai, sticky rice, spicy beef salad, spring rolls, and the coconut mushroom soup.  Family style so order a few plates."}
{"text":"*300th review!*  If it weren't for Yelp, I never in a million years would have stopped here for lunch. The restaurant is tucked in the back corner of a very sad and run down little strip mall. Half of the store fronts are empty and decrepit. The restaurant itself was pretty run down, but for so many good reviews, I'm willing to over look the scenery and jive with the hole in the wall-ness.  Ok, atmosphere first. There didn't seem to be any electricity. Or at least, they were saving on their bill, because there wasn't a single light on in the place, bathroom included. There was a tv playing some daytime drama (not in English) of a woman who cried the whole time, and a fan turning with as much energy as a fat kid on a bike (that means slow).   The decor is a mix of ethnic religious paintings, framed records of Journey and Michael Jackson and random musical instruments hanging on walls or jammed in corners. They must get down at some point, why else have 15 piece band equipment at your disposal?  The food. We ordered some kind of fried shrimp appetizer, a plate of veggie fried rice and chicken Pad Thai. The shrimp was good! They were fried in some kind of tasty cornmeal batter. The rice was.. Meh. The Pad Thai was all right, but the chicken was suspect. It tasted very strongly of... chicken. You know that flavor I mean? It's like the dark bits, the stuff you make your dad eat.   The owner was quite the character! He took our order and then went on a five minute rant about how crazy Indian (like from India) people are and how spicy they like to eat their food. At least I think that's what it was about.   The quirkiest part of the whole thing was the limes. I know, right? The limes? When he brought over our water, it came with a plate of sliced Key Limes. The tiny and delicious ones! The Pad Thai came with Key Limes too! They were sweet and juicy and amazing and completely unexpected.  I don't know that I'd ever come back, I rarely go to Mesa in the first place. But I wouldn't rule it out I guess."}
{"text":"So basically 2 stars because you get a lot of bang for your buck here. The biggest problem is that there is basically NO flavor in their dishes.  I love Thai food because it is flavorful and complex - but this food was beyond simple and completely bland.  We ordered takeout of pad thai, drunken noodles, and red curry. While there was a fair amount of heat, i have never had such bland pad thai in my life! There was almost no hint of tamarind!!! And believe it or not, it could have used a good amount of salt! (coming from someone who rarely salts her food, this is huge!)  Overall, it was incredibly disappointing. Not the worst Thai that I've ever had, but definitely close. If you like large amounts of bland food, this is your spot."}
{"text":"I have been regularly coming to this place since they opened like 12 years ago. It's phenomenal!  I highly suggest the panang nur, pad see ew, red curry, prik king, pad thai, and they have the best tom kah gah soup in the valley. And I  have never had a better egg roll in all my years. Be sure to thank Nancy in the kitchen. She is a badass."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time. It is the most authentic Thai in the valley. Love the tasty dishes and wonderful owners. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"When I lived in Mesa, I would go here at least once a month (regardless of the area not being the best, and located in a somewhat dingy strip mall). But, after moving to the far West side, it's not often that I get to Mesa anymore.  However, after going to Scottsdale on a weekend getaway, I decided to stop there for a late lunch. And, the place was pretty crowded, which I was glad to see for the owners (Obe and Nancy).  When I walked in, the place could use a face lift. But, Obe remembered me (though, it's been years) and seated me at our (I say \"our\" since my mother was usually with me) regular table. Well, the Thai Iced Tea is still awesome. And, the servings still generous for the price.  I ordered the Mongolian Beef Lunch special that comes with Won Ton soup (still delicious) spring roll (very good), fried rice (excellent) and the Mongolian Beef (nice and spicy, without being overly powerful). And, I had enough left over for a lite dinner later that evening."}
{"text":"Royal Thai Grill is our go-to Thai restaurant. It may be a hole in the wall, it may not be pretty, but those are the best kind. Art and Nancy have been here for 17 years (I think) , and we've been coming for at least 15.    The menu is not expansive, but has flavorful selections. Our favorites are the panang and pad Thai, with the satay as an appetizer. Spice is always to order, and the food fresh, hot and delicious.  As far as rebutting the other comments regarding the atmosphere and service: Art is from Thailand. Hence Thai food. He speaks broken English and does not sugar coat things. It's not his way. But make no mistake, he values every customer and is thankful for his successful restaurant. He is, as one gentleman noted, very diverse and interesting. He was a musician before getting a pacemaker. He did some crazy stuff in Thailand, which he'll tell you about freely if you indulge him. The music memorabilia and periodicals all around are things he loves and wants to share .  Give Royal Thai a chance. But keep in mind, it is Thai. Not Chinese. The people ordering like it's Chinese or Panda Express in a Thai restaurant amazes me. This food is the jam."}
{"text":"This is right down the street from me and I just now found it. It's delicious. They have $5.95 lunch and $6.95 dinner specials and about 100 items on the menu. It's open 7 days a week and their Thai tea is yummy. This is my new favorite local spot."}
{"text":"I never get tired of their food. They are a sweet couple and really love what they do. They recently had to close up a lot of days due to a close death in the family, but they are back to doing what they do best. They cheer every time I come in :)"}
{"text":"Always very good. Super cheap prices. I think if you branch out and try the less familiar dishes, you'll like them. They have great flavors here. I think people who order the usual stuff like chicken chow mein etc etc think it's bland because that's a kinda boring dish. Everyone has chicken chow mein! Try something different. Yeah the owner is hard to understand, but he knows the basics and it's not too hard to order. If you ask to make it spicy, it adds extra flavor. So sad that they're hardly ever busy, but they're tucked away hidden behind the liquor store and rally's. They really need a better location, or something like that. I just barely realized they were here recently. I talked to him today and he said this might be his last year. Sad face :( :( he's been there 16 years he said.   Maybe we can help him stay put by frequenting his restaurant more often!  Go! Eat! Explore the flavors of Thailand!"}
{"text":"Authentic Isaan Food.  If you want realThai food then this is the place to go in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have it on good authority that this place serves some of the most authentic Thai food in the valley. Never having been to Thailand, I can't say - but what I can say is that I've been here many times, and the food and service never disappoint!   Royal Thai is in a small strip mall. Neither the exterior nor interior are anything special. But the food! It's a great place to go with a few friends, and order family style. But if you like it spicy, be sure to let them know - otherwise they tend toward less spice for American tastes."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm rating this place at 5 stars because I have very little prior Thai dining experience.  That being said, I will rate it based on customer service, atmosphere, food, and price.  I've been reading all the reviews for this place and people are complaining about it being packed, but at 8 at night, it was empty.  Because of this, the service was exceptional.  I don't know if that's how it normally is but it was incredibly fast and convenient.  In fact, Fresh Off the Boat was on and I got in and out in about the time a full episode aired.  People were also complaining about the owner talking your ear off.  Not the case with me.  The couple took my order, brought it out and then went back to their own thing.  The atmosphere was fair.  It seemed to be an Asian restaurant but maybe a little dingier but honestly some of the biggest hole-in-the-wall places tend to be the best so please don't take that to mean the place is bad.  They had Fresh Off the Boat playing on the TV which was nice.  I ordered the Mongolian Beef along with a Thai tea which, like mentioned, were brought out incredibly fast.  The Mongolian Beef was good.  It's not the best Mongolian Beef I've ever had, but it's the first Thai rendition of it that I've had.  I usually eat Korean or Chinese Mongolian Beef (I know that statement sounds strange).  The Thai tea on the other hand was the best Thai tea I've had.  It was like a Thai tea flavored smoothie with shaved ice on top.  From what I could tell, the food portion of the experience was similar to many Chinese restaurants of similar style.  As for the price, it was unbelievable.  I ordered a full sized combination meal (Mongolian Beef, rice, wonton, egg roll) with a Thai tea, which is usually around 15-17 dollars for just that.  My purchase came out to be just under 12 dollars before tip.    I would highly recommend this place to a friend and I hope to return here often as I live right around the corner from it.  Please come here because the food, service, atmosphere and price are incredible."}
{"text":"Rough around the edges when it comes to the looks of the restaurant, but when it comes to the food and the service it's awesome. The owner is super friendly. I'm half Thai so I'm picky when it comes to Thai food and this place deserves a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The worst experience yet! Do not eat here this food is disgusting! I ordered coconut soup and I'm still to this day not sure what they tried to serve me. Not only does the soup lack the color of coconut soup but the smell and presentation was terrible. When I asked for a refund they explained they weren't able to process one and if I wanted my money back I should call the cops. I did.... even the cops were confused. These folks are MESSSY"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I have ever had!!!! It's a hole in the wall but the food is unreal!!!"}
{"text":"The food is not bad at all. we are actually used to come here years ago. However the location is freezing inside.. like 45 degrees. Had to keep our coats on. I placed the order and when the appetizer came it was the wrong thing. I tried to explain to the server/owner that this is not what I ordered but he argued that I ordered what he brought. I said whatever and we kept what he brought. He's old n I just wanted to have a nice dinner. Still, I hate having to pay $8 bucks for something I didn't want."}
{"text":"This place was unfortunately not very good, it had a weird location and we were worried when we walked in and were the only ones in the restaurant. Most of us ordered green curry which was bad but the pad Thai was decent and saved the meal."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would!  This isn't the friendliest place in town.  Sure, it was close to our house but never again will I set foot in this nasty place.  Our first interaction with the owner was him making fun of Americans, that was why they have the \"diner special\" posted all over the restaurant.   I felt very uncomfortable the second I walked in there.  It felt as if he just saw dollar signs when he would glance at my wife and I.     On to the food.... Horrible, just horrible, I ordered the Shrimp Lo-mein.  To my surprise the food came out really quick!  The second he put the plate of hot mess in front of my face the smell almost started my gag reflex. Now I knew why it had come so fast.  The mixture of noodle, canned mushrooms, cabbage, snow peas, bamboo shoots and whatever else they had thrown in the mix with the shrimp all had burn marks on them.  It looked like they had only stirred the mixture only once, then let the one side just sit in the pan until they smelt it burn, ding, the timer was done.   The smell of burnt food actually ended up being the taste of the whole meal!  Now, I am one who will have the waiter take back the plate of food if it is not up to eatable standards but in this case I didn't want to have to fight with this guy about how horrible this plate of crap was.  I nibbled on what looked eatable then we quickly packed our left overs, paid and left, the closes garbage can we found we threw the food away.  I'm not quite sure why or if we ordered the right thing but I can't figure out why this place is getting highish reviews on Yelp.  How this place is still open in that matter.  I say turn around and run from this place.  Go try a different hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Royal Thai Grill is in conspicuous, and it's a no-frills kind of restaurant. The best part about this restaurant is the food a the low-key atmosphere. The food delicious, and an excellent value.  I see others have tried to put this restaurant down with their comments here on Yelp, but don't be fooled by those comments, this restaurant is definitely worth trying and returning to. I would highly recommend this restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH DAMN.  This place is LEGIT tasty, and STUPID spicy!  Super unfancy. Super tiny. Super clean. Super real.  It seems to be run by a cute older couple. REALLY AMAZING FOOD! ZING.  It's in a super tiny little plaza just east of Rally's. Skip the Big Buford and go for something euphoric."}
{"text":"The old saying stays true \"dont judge a book by its cover.\" When I first pulled up, I judged it right  away. Once I was greeted by the owner, my thoughts immediately changed. The owner treated us as if we were part of the family.  We were laughing & cracking jokes ^_^   Pad Thai was delicious! The food was an authentic home style. Everyone at the table shares the food."}
{"text":"Friendly with good food...what else do you need.  I wish they were closer to where we live.  Thai noodle soup is delicious and authentic Beef jerky appetizer is awesome  It's a hole in a wall that shouldn't be overlooked."}
{"text":"We have tried many Thai restaurants around town, and we love this place. The atmosphere isn't the best so we tend to get our food to go, but the owners are very pleasant if you decide to eat in. It is very authentic Thai food like the food we were served in Phuket last June when we visited. Very large portions typically we get 2 meals out of the order. Try the Pad Thai and the Massaman  Curry! So yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Has a cute mom and pop feel. Definitely not the place you want to go to if you're trying Thai food for the first time. The owners have a lot of character and spunk. They're adorable!"}
{"text":"Don't really know why this place has such great reviews. I've lived in the area for a little over a year and decided to give this place a try. I'm very particular about thai food. I ordered take out--yellow curry and lemon chicken.  When I got there, there was a cart full of dishes on the left and a cart full off chopped lettuce on the right, there was barely a path available to get to the register. But I digress, if it's good food, I'm willing to ignore the annoyance of playing maze.  Yellow curry-- the spice was spot on, but the vegetables were soggy, as if they were cooked days ago. Most of it was onion anyway.  Lemon chicken-- smelled burnt when I got home, looked burnt as well. Surprice!! It was burnt.  Really won't be going back, extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Recommended by friends who go to Thailand frequently. Not a disappointment. Super friendly owners. Must try the Thai Beef Jerky and a yellow curry dish the owner recommended!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical first going here becsuse of the location but I was pleasantly surprised. Been there twice now and each time the food is great. The pad Thai and chow mien were delicious and my order was done quickly. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The owner is funny and nice, but the lunch menu was not Thai more chinese based."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the fried beef or fried pork with a side of sticky rice. They use good quality briskets to make these and marinated it so there is a natural sweet and soft texture. It is definitely their main highlights and the best that I have tried so far in the states. I'm Thai so I definitely know my Thai food dishes. Other dishes that worth trying are the e-San type (North Eastern Thai food) like papaya salad, larb and nam tok."}
{"text":"So I met this dude a while back named Steve.  I met Steve through my friend Tyler.  Now my first impression of Steve is that he's a total \"bro.\"  He has a fitted hat on and the bill is ironed and he's wearing it crooked.  Steve says obnoxious shit and is all-in-all a tough pill to swallow.  But who cares?  I don't have to best friends with the guy, he's an acquaintance.  The next time I see Steve, Tyler and I head to his apartment where we were all going to leave to get some coffee.  I walk in and Steve is doing a cute girl's hair.  I mean, he's coloring it.  He has his own salon chair and he has a mirror set up and a wash bowl in his kitchen.  All my preconceived notions were shattered.  I knew nothing about this dude.     Recently Steve takes me to the Royal Thai Grill.  Insisting that it's the best Thai food in Phoenix.  Saying specifically, \"Do you like going to Thai Basil?--you'll never go there again.\"  The restaurant is located in the corner of a small strip mall and pretty far out of the way for a guy who lives in Tempe.  The decor is lack luster.  Just some red booths and bamboo plants, etc.  Pretty standard stuff.             We sit down and the owner, an older Thai gentleman almost immediately says hello as he recognizes Tyler and Steve.  Then, much to my total shock and disbelief, Steve, the straight bro-ish hairstylist, begins speaking Thai to the owner.  Once again, I was completely at a loss for words.  It turns out Steve lived in Thailand for a couple of years.  Who is this dude?!            Steve was right.  The food was outstanding.  I had the Green Curry chicken and got it made \"medium\" spicy.  Now, Steve made sure I got that \"Thai\" medium not \"American\" medium and I suggest you get it that way too.  It was perfect (even though, next time I may try \"hot\") especially when paired with a cold bottle of Singha.  Steve got, what he tells me translates from Thai as, \"Meat Salad.\"  Which was really surprisingly flavorful and went perfect with sticky rice.  Tyler is a vegetarian and a bit of a picky eater, so he just got Lemon Tofu.  Which is from the Chinese food part of the menu but I will tell you that the batter on the tofu was phenomenal!  I work as a kitchen manager and many more years as a cook and that batter was absolutely flawless.  All the food is served in family style servings, so you're supposed to order your food and share it with others at your table.  So you end up getting a lot of food for your money.   So if you want exceptional Thai food (or Chinese), and according to my surprising friend Steve, a real Thai food experience go to Royal Thai Grill.  Bring someone you think you know everything about."}
{"text":"The owner is the exact opposite of our experience with Thai people. Horribly rude man. Will never go back. Even though the food is great. Probably the best Thai in town.   The Garlic Chicken is top shelf and they are the only ones who make anything like it."}
{"text":"My friends and I love the food at Royal Thai Grill. We are Thai so we know how good Thai food should be. The owners are very friendly. The price is very reasonable. I have been there at least 10 times now and never been disappointed. I'm so happy I found this place, my favorite Thai restaurant ever."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Was so looking forward to trying this place based on the reviews.   No one was in the place when we came in.   It is In serious need of updating and maybe the health inspector.   We sat in one of the larger tables and the server brought us water which he spilled and then moved us to a different table. We were only allowed to order from a menu in the wall which was basic Asian.  We all ordered the chicken pad thai which was BORING and Bland.  No spice at all.   The broth noodle soup was strange and not necessary.   Never ever go here.   It needs to close.  I don't know where the other reviews ate but it sure wasn't here."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Definitely a sketchy strip mall, but nice enough inside. Service was quick and attentive. I really appreciate any restaurant when they bring out a carafe of water for the table. Here you get a bonus dish of limes.   Lunch specials are 5.95, and there are plenty to choose from. I went with the green curry, which was quite good. The soup that came with it, chicken noodle, was subpar. I would definitely eat there again, as it's mostly good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The food is good and very plentiful. They have a H U G E menu, so everyone should be able to find something they like.  We just got home from there and it was our first time there.  If you are expecting a classy place this is not it.  The owner himself was our waiter.  The service is quick.  I am not real experienced when it comes to Thai food, we all ordered the basic meal, which is on the first page of the menu.  I had pad tai and my wife and her mom had Mongolian beef.  All of the meals on the first page come with a fried rice (very tasty), soup, egg roll and a wonton, which is nice and crispy.  All in all we enjoyed the food and because we were the only people in the restaurant, the owner came and entertained us with stories.  I liked him and there have been reviews that stated he was rude, but he was very friendly to us.  We all enjoyed our experience and I would come again."}
{"text":"The location is not fancy at all... but this is top-notch thai food!  And the owner is a bit of a comedian.  Good dining experience!"}
{"text":"* This place serves amazing NORTH EASTERN THAI food from Essan region. This is an important fact to take note of.  After reading the poor reviews for this place it's easy to see that the poor reviewers have never been to Thailand and had REAL Thai food. This is real Thai food.  The service is always super friendly. The old man is very sweet and very chatty. It's just him and his wife so sometimes he's busy. They ABSOLUTELY adjust the spice levels, so whoever said they don't is misinformed.  Why do they have Chinese food on the menu? Well, look at the poor reviewers here and that's exactly why. They're serving authentic NE Thai food here. Most people in AZ can't tell you where the USA is on a map let alone Thailand. They have to offer mainstream Chinese foods because that's what their clientele expects. Same reason the Burmese spot on Southern and McClintock does as well. Unfortunately, if they sold only their core product, they probably couldn't stay alive. This is Country Club and McKellips in Mesa, AZ, not the San Gabriel Valley in SoCal.  EVERYTHING from their Authentic Thai portion of the menu is amazing and will fill your taste buds with a real treat. Explore the menu and don't be afraid to order \"weird shit\"."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall place w great food. You will not have a better value than coming here. We tried it since our other place was too close to the Phoenix open. We live in FOUNTAIN HILLS so always need to find places nearby.  Dont let the nonfancy atmosphere keep u from great food at a great price!"}
{"text":"So I went here the other day with a friend for lunch. The food was.... strange. I don't know if this place makes Thai food from a different region than most others or what, but the menu was not what I expected and the food was not what I expected. The place had some 'Chinese' lunch specials.... which is weird in itself, and the main menu had thai food I guess. I ordered the chicken with pan fried noodles.... expecting like a crispy noodle. Not the case. I don't know why they call these pan fried noodles... they're just kind of greasy wide rice noodles that are like Chow Fun or something.... not at all what I expected. Also, what I found really strange, was that a) they don't have you choose a spice level, so the food isn't spicy at all and b) the food had green onions and cilantro and that's it as far as vegetables go. Every Thai place i have ever been to uses lots of fresh vegetables, which is why it generally is better than Chinese food. The noodles were fine, they had a decent taste, but I wouldn't want to go get them again. My friend really likes the curry here, so maybe that's good and I should try it next time.... but honestly I didn't think this place was so great.... Also, it was pricier than any other Thai food place I've been to, with most entrees costing around 10$."}
{"text":"Spicy Thai just the way I like it. Fish cakes, beef with curry, and Thai coffee are some of my favourite dishes.  They will cook it to the spice level that you like as well so for those of you who are true dare devils about spicy food, this can be one of the place where you can take your pallets for a ride.  Their fish cake is just cooked properly with great knife skills on the sweet cucumber sauce garnished with peanuts.  I have always been a regular here and always share some travel stories with him and his wife.  The decors may NOT be what you are looking for but the friendly service and great cuisine is what set this place apart from others.  The price is extremely affordable from $5.95 for lunch to $6.95 for dinner combination or you can order a la carte for your other desirable dishes.  Great for all budgets and most importantly your culinary pleasure of Thai food.  Keep in mind they do charge for rice which does upset some customers who will NOT return due to that fact.  I will address this with the owner and hopefully he will change his mind about this policy."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The fact it's only a couple miles from my house is an added bonus.   It's authentic northeastern Thai food. It's very good. I've backpacked through the region and know the cuisine, obviously not as much as someone who's lived there for years as an ex-pat, or a resident, but I feel I got a grasp of the cuisine in the month I lived there.   This place is phenomenal. It's the best Thai food I've had in the valley. Obviously it's not your typical Thai food restaurant, due to it being NE Thai, but don't let that turn you away. Don't let any of the bad reviews turn you away, I've been blown away by the food.   Their salads are all phenomenal. There is one with lettuce, glass noodles, bean sprouts, pork, and shrimp (forgot the name!) and that's my favorite. If you're not into spicy, order at a 1 or 2 spicy and they'll bring out the chili spice for you to put on yourself. I've ordered it a 3 spicy and it's almost too much for me to handle, and I LOVE spicy food and especially Thai spicy. They serve a pitcher of water at every table. Their larb salad is also to-die-for.   They serve traditional Thai soups like shrimp and rice, chicken and rice..etc. They're so good and a meal in and of themselves."}
{"text":"I am a Thailand return Peace Corps volunteer, which, for better or worse, has made me a Thai food snob. I came here after reading reviews about the authenticity of the food. We had the Tom yum, which was watered down and tasted simply like chicken broth, som tum (papaya salad) that was neither spicy, nor sweet, nor sour, and larb (minced chicken) that was equally tasteless. The owner was out telling (yelling) stories, which was amusing at first, but he could use some coaching of when enough is enough. I wouldn't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I went for lunch. The soup was ok. I got the chicken pad Thai. I didn't get an option for how spicy I wanted it, so it came out very \"white\". The fried rice was super dry and had no flavor. The chili oil was not oil. It was vinegar. I may go back and try something else. Maybe for dinner."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years. The foods is great. My favorite dish is the Mongolian beef. The noodle soup that comes with the combos is good too. If you like curry there are several good dishes as well. It's located in a shady looking strip mall and seems dingy in the outside but the food is great and the owner is very friendly."}
