{"text":"Ordered hamburger with extra pickles.  Arrived back to office to find cheeseburger with no pickles. Contacted restaurant, finally they realized what happened and apologized.  They called back to explain that the order was correct, they had just added cheese.  Gave the burger to my boss."}
{"text":"Really great authentic Greek food. Kinda was not expecting much in a strip mall in concord but was pleasantly surprised by the quality and the value for your meal is quite excellent."}
{"text":"We used to go here several times a week when it was a different Greek restaurant.  It was very disappointing when the new owners came in because they didn't just change the name, they changed the food too.  Maybe the food isn't that bad...but compared to the old cooking...it's just terrible... We tried it a few times to give it a chance because we got hooked on Greek food with the old owner/menu/recipes but this place just wasn't good without Mr. Karas's touch in the kitchen."}
{"text":"You must try this place, phenomenal Greek food - fresh & healthy. Huge portions and great prices."}
{"text":"Drove almost an hour out here on a Monday for Moussaka as I have yet to find a greek place near me that actually makes this dish! It was awesome and so where the other meals my family got. The greek salad and souvlaki were also great so will definitely be coming back again to try more. I am happy to find a place that serves my favorite greek dish and it was well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Great place absolutely love the beef strips. The salad dressing is to die for. We come here at least once a week. A must if your in Concord."}
{"text":"Staff horrible. Food is great but the staff are trouble maker. Really bad experience with one of the waitresses. When they see you look hot and good looking they get jealous of you.  They give you attitude when you are spending money. They even want to argue with you. I will never go back there. Ladies if you look good and pretty don't go there. They will give you attitude."}
{"text":"I have never had greek food before coming to this place and I love it! The food is amazing and the staff is great."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. I got the fried zucchini as an appetizer, perfect. For my entr√©e I ordered the Spaghetti A La Venice, and it was absolutely to die for. The price to portion ratio is spot on, and if you're on a budget and hungry, MyKonos is for you. Be sure to tip your waitress!"}
{"text":"We've given this place a couple of tries...We were fans of the previous operators' Spartans.  We really wanted to like it, and definitely don't like giving negative reviews...But here is why we are doing so:  1st Visit we came with about 8 of our friends.  We all ordered, had a very nice server who did a great job.  We had appetizers, our meals and even beer and dessert.  All was good until we received our checks.  We were wrongly charged for a couple sides of  sauce...We had actually ordered one though.  No big deal, we figure,....so we go to the register to pay.  The apparent owner or at least manager blames the mistake on us and insists on our paying the extra $1 for each of the two sauces.  Again...Not a huge deal, but it doesn't say much for any kind of devotion to making your customers happy....Well about 2 weeks later, we figure we will give it another shot.  We go in for lunch on a tuesday, all is good till we get our food.  Under my Gyro (which at this point is 3/4 eaten), on the plate , my wife notices a nice size black hair.  Again....Stuff happens.  By the time the waitress comes around to check on us,  my wife is done eating and I am close to it, although, I am not going to eat the fries in contact with the hair.   When we bring the matter to the waitress' attention, she instinctively (it seems) looks at her own long blond hair and says \"it isn't mine\" and tells us how it couldn't be anyone's in the kitchen hair \"because they all wear ball caps\". My wife very tactfully says \"My hair is light brown and my husband's is red/gray (the waitress was insinuating that the hair that was under the gyro was ours\" We explain that we do not want anything, other than to let the management know.  Well.....Now the manager comes to our table (same guy who took us for $2) and his first words to us were \"what do you want me to do? I'll have to see if anyone in the kitchen isn't wearing a hat\".  He never thought to use the word \"sorry\".  He proceeded to walk away.  He watched us walk out the door when we were done and paid, and never said another word to us.  We will say that the waitress was a nice girl, but when the Manager sets such a low standard for customer satisfaction and seems to only care about money, you can hardly blame her.  We wanted this to be a \"go to\" place, but in this case....2 strikes and you're out!  It is sad to see a $1 be all that matters.  There are too many other places to go to eat."}
{"text":"Love the greek salad with lamb. Wish they didn't nickel and dime for extra tiziki sauce, but hey they are there to make money."}
{"text":"Great authentic Greek food with very reasonable dinner prices! Quick service! We were very pleased with the friendly staff. Nice \"sit down\" dinner, yet casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and got the gyro combo. I never had a Greek salad with just iceberg lettuce and two pieces of cucumber and some onions? The lamb was definitely not fresh nothing about this place seemed fresh. Service  was fast which was the best part. This is more like a fast food joint than anything else."}
{"text":"Great tasting Greek favorites!  We have eaten here several times and the food is always tasty.  The customer service is usually excellent, but can be slow at times.  For example, waiting for water and menus sometimes has taken more than 5-10 minutes.  Otherwise, the rating would be 5 stars!  When a server finally appears, it's great service all around.  We especially enjoy their Greek salad with grilled chicken.  If you are looking for tasty Greek food and eating in a casual dining environment (outside dining is also available), this is the place!"}
{"text":"The food here is always fresh and delicious! The service is fast and the portions are very generous. We hit this place every week!"}
{"text":"Mykovos Grill has just made another new guest very happy (and pleasantly full). :) The spanakopita and Greek salad with baklava for dessert was excellent!  The atmosphere for eating indoors or out - just right.  Cost is very reasonable and service is given graciously."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for a quick in and out lunch. Great prices and they are very efficient. I got a Greek salad and it was good, but definitely cheaper out on the lettuce. Basic Greek food, but done well at a great price."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!!  Owner is very attentive to your needs. Always there watching over every detail. Service is excellent. Very friendly staff. The gyros are sooooo good. Prices reasonable. I'm hooked on this place!  Really enjoy eating on their patio. Call-ahead ordering is very convenient and efficient--ready in fifteen minutes."}
{"text":"The best Greek food you can find in the area. The owner was born and raised in Greece and the food is very authentic to Greek culture. They combine American flavors with Greek flavors to create a perfect blend of taste."}
{"text":"I didn't think I would ever like Greek food until I came here!!!! Delicious hummus! Their baklava is absolutely delicious and is definitely a hit in my family!!! They have delicious Greek dressing. Better than most I've tried. Not sure why it's so different! Yum! I ordered my food to go and it was ready and presented well inside the boxes. They definitely take pride in their work!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! This is a must eat at place when visiting the area. From appetizers through the entire meal, everything was simply perfect. Highly recommend the Greek meatballs - also the service was superb!"}
{"text":"This spot is something I saw while cruising around Concord. I was about to head back to Charlotte, and noticed there was a place with Greek food and everyone seemed to love it...pretty busy, AND they have a drive thru! I decided to go in, ordered a gyro, my wife got the chicken, and my kids got burgers and grilled cheese. EVERYONE LOVED THE FOOD! Great gyro, great chicken, my kods loved the burger, grilled cheese, and their fries are AWESOME! The service was great, and the experience was perfect. Keep it up, Mykonos! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food; generally good service. A local favorite. Take away has on a few occasions resulted in only one, instead of two, plates when ordering the same entree so have the order repeated. Beer is generally fresh. A place to go."}
{"text":"Food is excellent!!! Try the pork kabob and w the rice!  The owner is so inviting and always talks to us and plays around with the kids."}
{"text":"We finally got the chance to eat lunch at Mykonos and I am so happy (and 10 lbs heavier!).   We ordered:  sampler plate with spanakopita, gyro, chicken kebab, Domaldes and pita. Gyro meat was one of the best I have ever tasted. The flavor of the chicken was awesome but it was slightly dry. It doesn't mean I wouldn't order again... I said slightly.   Greek salad was a perfect portion, fresh and dressing was yummy!    We also ordered the mousakka....ummmm...SOOO GOOD!  It was so good I ordered another one for my husband for dinner tonight!    I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and desserts. Great restaurant and nice staff. One of my favorites still"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout on a Monday evening. They were pretty busy! Service was super friendly. I ordered the chicken souvlaki with salad and rice, as well as the chicken and rice soup. The chicken was served kebab style and had good flavor, but was just a tad on the dry side. The rice was good, but was almost over cooked. The salad was great with lots of feta. Soup was just ok. Overall a great meal and good portion size."}
{"text":"Great food and fast  friendly service .  First time here.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Its a good place to hit when you want a Gyro, the plates are good but they skimp on the Tzatziki sauce. The falafel appears to be squirted from a tube as it is tater tot shaped, the gyro meat does not appear to be shaved from a traditional rotisserie style cooker, more of a loaf type of meat that has been thick cut and grilled on a flat top. Prices are fair though for the amount of food you receive.  Food: 3 Sporks Service: 4 Sporks Atmosphere: 2 Sporks Sweet Tea: 2 Sporks Value: 4 Sporks Local Beer: 1 Sporks"}
{"text":"Most authentic Greek food you'll find in Charlotte. Every time I eat here I think my Greek grandmother cooked my meal. The food is fantastic and the service is excellent. The owner is ALWAYS there. That's a sign of someone who is passionate about what they do and it shows."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch there for the first time on Saturday. The service was fast, the food was hot and delicious and the portions were generous. I had the spanakopita and my wife had the chicken and pork souvlaki and they both came with a Greek salad and drink for $8. We will definitely be back for lunch and dinner again!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. The fries were lukewarm and a bit soggy. The worst thing was the service. We had to go up and get sauce. Our server never came by again after taking the order. Disappointed"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!!  The service is so quick and the food was so delicious.  My kids even loved it!  We will definitely have to go back very soon.  All of our food was correct and on point as well.  Also they gave our kiddos some free suckers which was a nice gesture."}
{"text":"We are regular patrons at this restaurant. Service is excellent as well as the fare. Good value for great food and service."}
{"text":"We love going to Mykonos! The food is great. The service is great. And our daughter feels like a princess every visit due to the special attention she gets. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My go-to spot when I'm craving Greek food. I always order the Chicken Souvlaki with double Greek salad and wheat pita with extra tzaziki on the side. The service is quick and the prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get! Lunch combos are served from 11am-4pm with a drink included ($8.95 for the Chicken Souvlaki meal), and then dinner prices increase to $8.65 without a drink. Their menu also includes subs, sandwiches, pasta and a delicious Spinach pie option called Spanakopita."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious and reasonably priced!  The Greek salad with grilled chicken was yummy!  Also tried the gyro sandwich and it was very tasty.  The best taste of all was the taziki, wow so good!  Try one of the Greek beers too!"}
{"text":"Their chicken souvlaki is really good. I ordered the burgers once and they were very flavorful. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice Mediterranean fast food meal."}
{"text":"Excellent Food.  Prices are very reasonable.  We were greeted quickly and seated.  My husband and I both ate the Greek Salad with grilled Chicken.  It was very fresh and the chicken was so moist.  Three different waitresses checked to make sure we had everything we needed and if the food met our satisfaction.  Loved this restaurant."}
{"text":"We stopped here by chance when in Concord - it was awesome! The food was super tasty and it came out hot and fast! They had me at Avegolomono soup! ;) Great service too - our server, which may or may not have been the owner, answered all our questions about the menu and gave us suggestions of things to try.  Will definitely be back and will consider them next time we need a caterer!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. Both of my meals were not so good. I came back a second time hoping it would be better but no so.  The food is okay but not what I expected, with the flavor so so.  I wanted a dish without meat, instead of adding more veggies to make up for the meat that was removed they just removed the meat; this made for a small serving.    The restaurant has been busy both time we visited, I guess because there is not another Greek restaurant close by. I can't recommend Mykonos and won't be back to giving it a 3rd try."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Mykonos. I went with two other friends. First we shared the trio appetizer which is hummus, tzatziki, and spicy feta. The hummus was very tasty and heavy on garlic. I love garlic so was perfect. The tzatziki was tasty but the star was the spicy feta. Think Greek pimento cheese with a kick.  For dinner I had Gyro with 1/2 salad and 1/2 fries. Gyro was tasty, I prefer thinly sliced meat, however the meat was very well seasoned. My friends ordered spanakopita and gyro. Both enjoyed their meals. They were very busy on our visit but we were seated within about 5-10 minutes on a Saturday night. The service was great once we were seated. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered (to-go) the Authentic Chicken Souvlaki and it was fine. It was kind of plain. it wasn't bad but i don't think ill go back to fulfill any cravings or anything."}
{"text":"...Ok, ok I like it here now. Maybe I just needed to \"acquire\" the taste OR the food is actually better. The staff is still hit or miss, but the food is good so that is really all that matters. I guess I can roll with the beverage supposedly included only before dinner time or whatever it is. Salad ingredients still somewhat skimpy. One thing that does work in the favor of this location is the drive-uo window to pick up carry-out orders that have been called in."}
{"text":"Mykonos Grill is a little hidden gem.  It's a very unassuming place that serves good Greek food.   We started off with the Dolmades which are pretty good.  I could do with a little less oil but the taste is really good.   Also had the gyro platter with rice and Greek salad.  Again the food was really good and the price is pretty amazing.     We have repeated and will continue to stop by web we are in the area.   Go with confidence."}
{"text":"Wonderful Greek Food! Best I've had since being in Athens. The Tzatziki is AMAZING. The chicken souvlaki is to die for. Chicken has good flavor and the pita tastes very fresh. LOVE LOVE LOVE!"}
{"text":"Was very surprised that this was almost a fast food place. You walk in and place your order, then carry your own tray to a table. Nothing special about the food; I have had much better. The food was fair as was the menu. There were bottles of wine on display at the order counter, but no drink menu or offers by the staff. This one is a pass."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in concord. Food is always excellent!! Service is always good. The owner always comes by to speak and check on you which I think says a lot. Very reasonably priced. My kids who are 5 and 3 also love it (chicken on a stick) We get the chicken souvlaki over rice w/ fries and salad for around $8.55 it is a hearty meal. The kids usually eat off of our plates bc it is enough to share. They are a role model restaurant and if you haven't been there you are missing out. Plus....I almost forgot....the best part....they have a drive thru pick up window. I can call in my order and pick it up with out getting the kid out of the car!!  Outstanding."}
{"text":"Nice place with good service. Average gyro that just didn't have much flavor. Not bad but just kind of flat. Maybe the cucumber sauce was at fault."}
{"text":"I've spent approximately six weeks in Greece and can claim to be a foodie in their cuisine!  Since I'm not Greek I can't claim full expertise, but still take this review very seriously. Ha!  Last night was my first visit to this restaurant, which I instantly related to an upscale Shomars (it is better).  I tried the pork souvlaki which was marinated very nicely and was cooked just right. Also tried the traditional Greek salad which was decent. Also tried the chicken and rice soup which was a little too creamy. I passed the dessert case at least 3 times and drooled over all of the cheesecakes and other sweets. Unfortunately my belly screamed no more food and I was unable to try a dessert. Til next time...."}
{"text":"Holy cow is all I have to say. This is one of my favorite places ever. Idk how they make the chicken the way they do but it is so amazing. I wish I didn't live so far away from here because I could eat this 3 times a week haha. Please open another one in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Greek place. We tried the appetizer platter. Loved the tzatziki and hummus. Then had gyro sandwich with Greek fries. I wouldn't say it's the best of my life but it was exactly what I wanted when I went looking for Greek."}
{"text":"Came with my boyfriend for the first time. It was pretty good. I had chicken soulvaki and he had a gyro. Both were pretty good. And the fries and Arnold Palmer were pretty good..we will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered a large Greek salad with gyro meat and a large drink to go.  My only negatives were minor so I'll get them out of the way.  I had asked for no olives but still got some and their to-go cup is not much larger than a Dixie cup.  Now for the positives.  This was the best Greek salad I have ever eaten.  The dressing was unique.  It was tangy like a typical Greek dressing but had just a hint of sweetness to it.  The gyro meat was thick and generous in addition to being extremely tender and delicious.  On top of the great food, the gentleman who waited on me who I'm assuming was the manager was extremely friendly, courteous and helpful.   I will definitely be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the service rivaled the best I have ever had!  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"What a great little find in the small city of Concord! The menu was reminiscent of Showmars which is very popular for their gyro platters. The difference is that here, the food is authentic and made with love.   I came with my son for a late lunch and both ordered the gyro lunch special with half rice, half salad.   The setup here is also similar to Shownars. You order at the counter, find a seat and the food is delivered by the staff along with napkins and utensils.   Let's start with the salad. Iceberg lettuce shreds with slivers of red onion, diced tomatoes and thin slices of green bell peppers, topped with feta crumbles and one kalamata olive. The dressing was a pinkish hue which threw me off at first but It is DIVINE! It's served on the side so you can add as little or much as you want.  The rice was ok. It was cooked well but I've had better rice at other Greek joints.  The star of the show however is the gyro. The platter comes with three thick slices of gyro meat over pita bread, not the thin slices you may expect. Can I kiss the person who made that decision? The result was a nice salty crusty exterior with succulent juicy meat inside. Each slice was packed with flavor. Grab a little meat, a little bread, top It with a little salad and there my Yelp friends, you have the perfect bite!  This place is a good 30 min drive from home but I see myself checking in a lot more often for that gyro."}
{"text":"First impression was great! Patient, kind, staff, answered all our questions. Food was fantastic and had a savory flair. Finished with dessert. Yum!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Greek food in the Charlotte area! The chicken is always moist. I get my child to eat the Slovakia by calling it chicken on a stick. I don't know where they get their pita bread but it's the best I've ever had. I know that strange to say about pita bread but it really is exceptional. The spanakopita is also very good.  Their tz sauce is the best!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I NEVER thought I would go to a restaurant for a salad! However, the grilled chicken Greek salad is to die for! The Greek dressing has crack in it! So addictive."}
{"text":"Incredible Greek food at inexpensive prices. They marinate their chicken, pork and beef 48 hours. Beef was so tender and flavorful. Fresh Pita served warm."}
{"text":"Very good food and super fast service. Only issue is they were out of turkey. Got the Philly cheese steak. It was really good."}
{"text":"My sister insisted I try Mykonos. Their lunch menu is affordable and fresh, the portions are big and their people are FANTASTIC! I will definitely be back! Loved this place :)"}
{"text":"This place is off the chain. Great place for lunch or dinner. Can eat here pretty healthy. Definitely better than hitting a burger joint. You won't be disappointed. Great local place that is always packed out. Bam!"}
{"text":"Awesome Greek food and awesome service! We have been here numerous times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a great Greek restaurant, very clean, very organized, employees are very attentive to your needs and the best thing was the Gyro is great! The only thing I could say negative is the employees are so focused on their work,  that they forget to smile!"}
{"text":"I had a taste for some authentic Greek food so my sister recommended Mykonos Grill!   As soon as I walked through the door the smell from the kitchen delighted my taste buds and confused me, \"confused because I wanted to try everything!\" Lol... The young lady behind the counter (Aliyah) was very helpful and even described how yummy the soup was and offered me a sample (and it was tasty). The food was cooked fresh to order and came out quickly!   I ordered the chicken wrap with a Greek salad and this plate was a beast! It is defiantly a two person or eat some now save for later platter!    The only thing they could have done better was wrap the chicken wrap in foil because it was a little soggy by the time I got home! The inside was still very tasty!"}
{"text":"Great food at an unbelievable price! The freshest food I have had in Charlotte! This place is a TREASURE! Can't wait to bring the family back for a 100% GREEK GLENDI!  #welcometomynewfavoriteplaceonearth"}
{"text":"My go-to lunch place in Concord for a delicious and reasonably priced meal. The Greek spaghetti is terrific!  Their moussaka is amazing at dinner and sometimes you can even get it at lunch."}
{"text":"Good fast food! Great place to eat lunch when your working. They have a callin and then you actually go through a drive through and pay for your food. Very casual dining but friendly staff. Plates are pretty big and the sauce is amazing!!! Food is always hot and eat here at least once a week! The lunch specials are great from the burger to the salad. Dont forget your pita bread! It comes with most meals!"}
{"text":"I'm traveling here on business alone, and based on the reviews I decided to try out this restaurant by myself. The food was fantastic and great service, very nice freestanding building, everything was great Some of the best Greek food I've ever had and at a great price. And that's just my opinion because I wasn't eating with anyone else."}
{"text":"Tonight was take out from Mykonos.  My daughter wanted a Mediterranean wrap with grilled chicken.  She really enjoyed it.  I got Greek spaghetti.  It was really good.  This place has really good lunch specials and a drive thru if you are looking for something during the midday.  They have a nice dessert selection featuring cheesecakes and tiramisu!  The dining area is really clean.  Their sanitation grade is a 96.5.  I would recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service and tasty Greek food at reasonable prices. I'm pretty picky with my Mediterranean food- I've lived in Turkey and several large cities with Greek communities, so I know what I'm talking about. I've always had a decent meal here. Try the fried cheese appetizer, saganaki, for something special and if you don't mind the cholesterol hit. It's only available at dinner. I usually order the chicken souvlaki and it's juicy and tasty. Comes with Greek salad, bread and rice. The Greek salad has an interesting pink-colored dressing but tastes good.  What would really elevate this place is if the bread were fresh baked, and if the gyros really were authentic. They're the diner sausage-like version. But you can't go wrong with the souvlaki. They also have spaghetti, sandwiches and burgers if you have someone in your party who's not adventuresome.  I'm happy to support a local restaurant that does its job well."}
