{"text":"I love cheeseburgers. I mean really really really love cheeseburgers. I don't love peeps with my patty. I don't want peanut butter smeared on my donut bun. So I ordered a freaking cheeeeeeeeezeburgrrrrrrrrrrr. What did I get? Grill marks on a bun. That is all it tasted like. Grill marks. That's all, I'm done."}
{"text":"I ate here last night and got food poisoning.  Our fries came out cold, but they did get us some new ones after we asked.   The oh cheesus was very good and the fries were too.  I would give it a 3/5 without the food poisoning.  Don't think I'll be able to look at burger from anywhere for a while......"}
{"text":"Omg. The oh cheesus is a burger with 2 friggin grilled cheese sandwiches as a bun. Fries are amazing,  service was great. The oh cheesus is a game changer. Get one!"}
{"text":"The food came out hot and was so delicious!  The beer selection is on point :)  The bartender was awesome!  All good things.."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst meals we've ever had. Warm beer, cold burgers, terrible service.  Our burger was replaced with a turkey burger; the fries were soggy and cold. Drive past this dirty place, and don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Burgers always good. Imaginative burger choices to go along with wide variety of beers including craft beers from all over the country. The burger of the month is often a highlihht."}
{"text":"I've visited Burgers 2 Beer a few times for drinks at the bar, but have only dined in twice. The first time was right after the grand opening and it wasn't very impressive, so I decided to give it another shot.  The beer selection is great and offers many different styles of beer for every palate. The food, however, was subpar. One person at our table ordered their sandwich without onions, but was still made with onions anyway. We had to call over a different server to correct the mistake because ours was nowhere to be found. Another person at our table received cold fries, so they quickly brought over a fresh plate. The sandwich was taken off the bill, but not the fries. The wait staff was not rude about the situation, but also not overly pleasant. I will likely return for drinks, but would not recommend the food."}
{"text":"Was in town just for one night and this was right up the street from our hotel.  Owners were onsite and recommend the vampire burger and the oh cheesus...both were out of this world!  The owners take pride in the menu and it shows! We are foodies and know a good burger...this did not disappoint! Highly recommend without hesitation! Thanks so much for a wonderful evening and we will definitely be back when we are here to see the Indians!  Cannot say enough about the quality and hospitality we received... If you want top notch service and food this place is a must!!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and the tot mess burger was to die for. Perfectly cooked med rare burger, fries were good too. The crab dip appetizer was a little on the smaller side. the server didn't seem to Know the beer menu too well.  I had to remind them to grab paper towels and ketchup....& they didn't check back on us after we got our food. So the 4 stars is really for the food. Service could be more attentive. Service was 2 stars."}
{"text":"Great burger selection actually cooked to Temp you ask, how awesome is that. Atmosphere is great, apps are well balanced, draft selection great and fun people working. Black bean burger is Awesome. Monday nights $5 dollar burgers are a great deal."}
{"text":"Ugh! I wanted love this place so much more! They're menu is exciting with a massive variety of burgers! Yum! Gimmie some garlic aioli!  However... While the burgers were \"good\", they're not \"great\". The flavors offered you'd expect a punch of flavor but it's on the blander side.   My BIGGEST upset is the amount of GREASE my burger  had. Grease is used in place of flavor, technique, and skill and it's a shame that my burger was SO soggy the bottom bun fell apart as I tried to eat it and left a puddle of grease dripping onto my plate as I ate.  Nice atmosphere, decent pricing, I may try again but I've eaten better for cheaper and that's a sad sad thing. Excessive fat does not = tasty yummy burger for people that know food."}
{"text":"DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS RESTAURANT. Horrific burnt burgers and horrible customer service.  The new manager,Bob at Burgers 2 Beer in Highland Heights could not have been hired for his customer service skills.  We have been loyal customers at this specific B2B since their grand opening and used to rave about the burgers and the customer service. Not anymore! The new manager has ruined any satisfying experience my friends and I have had.   A few months ago we ordered 3 Good, Bad & Ugly burgers that were BURNT. Not a little burnt but charred with no flavor. Honestly, our dog wouldn't eat them. Since our order was takeout we didn't realize how bad the burgers were until we arrived home. Called B2B and the manager at that time apologized, told us to return at any time and ask for her and she would replace them. Calling back after a few weeks, Bob is now new manager and said he and the previous manager are friends and he will ask her about it and call me back! Really? Who lies about getting 3 burnt burgers that you have to verify it with someone else? Are you not empowered to make a decision on your own as manager?  Weeks go by and the manager Bob never calls me back. I called today, June 28, 2017 and left a message. I got a return call from Bob stating that he spoke to the previous manager and she doesn't recall this incident and that it's been months since this happened and \"what do I want him to do?\"  I know exactly what to do even if Burgers 2 Beer does not know.  Never return."}
{"text":"We have gone several times now. Every-time we have gone, the seating has been an issue. While I understand that places can get busy and you need to wait, whoever is hosting really isn't doing a good job with multiple 4 and 6 tops taken by 2 people and a plethora of 2 tops sitting empty.   This last time, we had called ahead to see if seating would be a problem on a Thursday at 6:00pm for 3 adults and 2 children. We were told \"no problem\".   We arrived to the same issue, multiple booth (6 tops) and 4 tops occupied by 2 people and had to wait 20 minutes. So, we again had to wait with two young hungry children in an inadequate waiting area. For some reason, half the restaurant is closed.  I am not particularly sure why we couldn't have been offered a table there.  One of my party ordered the Reuben on the waiter's recommendation and it came out burnt. The burger I had and the pulled pork my mother had were both good. Service was pleasant albeit somewhat slow, another issue we have had here. We keep going back because it is one of the few places with a kids menu, but last time may have been our last."}
{"text":"My reviews have been up and down but if you are lucky enough to be there when Meagan's working in the back area your service will be phenomenal. She does one hell of a job."}
{"text":"I have been to burgers 2 beer many time and always had excellent food and service. The burgers are amazing!! But today I stopped by to get a milkshake and was shocked to find out that they were $5.99 for a small-medium size that wasn't even filled all the way. The chocolate shake was good but mainly tasted like syrup and was definitely not homemade. Recommend for food but not shakes to go"}
{"text":"If you are going to eat here get one of their unique burgers and forget everything else.  We had Aaron has our bartender/server. He was great, very friendly, and was able to answer all of our questions about the 30 plus beers they have on tap. We are definitely going to be coming back."}
{"text":"I was in town for the holiday and wanted to try something new.  I walked in on a really slow thanksgiving day after and the guys working there were really accommodating and very nice for having to work on that day.  The mudroom burger in had was amazing with some kind of garlic sauce.  They cooked it to how I wanted (slow day) and guided me through all the options.  Will go again and try another unique burger that's quick and priced well."}
{"text":"Great food, and even better people. The hot chick was delicious and cooked perfectly. David, the manager, truly cares about his customers, and the staff is welcoming and warm."}
{"text":"Had a Strawberries meet red onions Salad with some garlic parmesan wings. Very good.  Be warned the shots are very pricy!"}
{"text":"Awesome burger place, I come here for lunch and I have tried almost all of their burgers, and those tots OMG those tots are delicious. The service is always on point and the place is a little bit divey but with the food here how could I avoid it? The one downside is that they do charge you for extras and customizations but I get it it's a business."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and was looking for a good burger.  I found this place and it did not disappoint. The staff was very friendly!  I had to go with what was recommended; burger, onion rings and beer. I had the jalapeño burger and the grilled sweet onions on it was a great balance for the jalapeño heat.  Both the burger and rings were cooked perfectly.   This is a family owner place and the owner came out and talked with the patrons.  I travel a lot and I love local food especially when it's family owned. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my \"go to\" place for neighborhood burgers. Especially on Mondays when is Burger happy hour!!! Best deal in the City.  And THAT deal alone made me a customer for non special days  The Luther... Oh my GOD...!!!!!"}

{"text":"Great food and staff and Great service. What an Amazing place !!!!  Absolutely love this Place. David Lopez and His Wife are very nice People   The burgers were great and big.   Thank You Elie Chamoun For Bringing This Concept To Cleveland ;)  and You guys DESERVE  it absolutely : Cleveland's best burger on Cleveland's Hot List.. good luck and keep up the Good Work ..."}
{"text":"Great Lunch Spot. Different types of burgers. I go with the simply Susan. Can get busy at time but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out - Online. The website ordering form must have errors programmed in. My fiance wanted a Bison burger with a side of vegetables. The website changed it to \"Sub Veggie Burger\" ... Had to watch my body builder fiance pretty much breakdown that he had no protein. Who would order a bison burger and substitute it with a veggie burger? That should have thrown the kitchen off enough to call and clarify the order. The nachos were bottom of the bag disgusting dry mess. I had a Thai peanut chicken sandwich that was a grilled breast in a pretzel bun, no topping or sauces. We have had eat-in/take-out from almost every restaurant in Lakewood, this one is now at the top of the list for worst. Don't waste your time, this place is a chain, never eat from a chain."}
{"text":"Another good meal at b2b.  Jen was training a new server (frank) service was great.    Wings are good, burgers also, buffalo chicken dip with chips hit the spot."}
{"text":"We order burgers for takeout from B2B 2-3 times a month and we absolutely love it. We've eaten in the restaurant a few times and have always had good service and very friendly servers, we just prefer to eat at home so we do takeout more often. We started eating there when we discovered them in Highland Heights while searching for local restaurants that sell grass fed beef, and I literally jumped up and down and screamed for joy when I found out they were opening right in my neighborhood lol. People seem to complain a little bit about the price, but I'd love to know where else you can get a grass-fed burger around here for $10! You're paying an extra buck or 2 to have way higher quality meat, it's leaner and even has more omega-3s and other nutrients (which is a fact you can see for yourself on the nih.gov website). They offer gluten free buns for $2, lots of creative toppings and the fries are fresh cut, plentiful and awesome. I highly recommend them!!"}
{"text":"We LOVED this place! It's awesome that there's finally a place outside of downtown to get a grass fed beef burger (and they even had gluten free buns to sweeten the deal!). The burgers were nice and juicy, that's not so common with grass fed since it tends to be super lean so we were very happy with the burgers. They had a ton of fun combinations, they had Angry Orchard Hard Cider on tap (again, another gluten free option that made our visit that much better!), and considering the size of the place, I thought they had a great beer selection; way more than you'd expect from a regular little burger and beer joint. The owner seated us and came to check on us, he was very friendly. Our server (wish I remembered his name) was awesome and didn't get frustrated with our many/strange gluten free requests lol. We'll definitely be making frequent trips back!"}
{"text":"I came to this place before closing an hour and half. The waiter gathering his friends and were drinking togther, actualy he was drunk. I was asking for a food and he said we closed. Ok can i get a beer he also said NO. I hated this place because this guy"}
{"text":"This was our third visit here.  The last two visits the food took about an hour- for burgers and fries and they were way understaffed   This most recent visit we only came for pre-concert beers and the service was terrible.  The bar tender in the back was essentially ignoring customers and people were given refunds because food took so long.  It was topped off by the kitchen staff yelling at people as they walked in \"we're closed!\" \"No more food orders taken\"- at 8pm when hours say 10pm!  Burgers when we've eaten were good and staff, when they helped, were nice enough.  They need to staff up and it could be a great place"}
{"text":"I ordered a burger with mashed potatoes (forgot the name) and really enjoyed it! Their fries were also good. The waitress was friendly and helpful. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good burgers but absolutely horrible service. 1.5 hours before seeing our food, are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"Food is good. Staff could be friendlier. Plan on it not being a quick-stop. Seems to take 15-20 minutes no matter how slow/busy they are."}
{"text":"I used to love this place! I used to come in several times a week but I stopped coming in because of the poor service. This place has really went downhill fast. The staff was very rude and unorganized. I was charged different prices each time I came in for the same burger. So I decided to come back today to see if things have changed but they clearly have not. With that being said my friends and I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Never again!  - Visited Sunday Happy Hour and ordered a draft!  Bartender up sold me on a tall, but should have informed me that the $1.00 off only applies to pints (smaller size) and not on a large! No Happy Hour discount on the larger size!! Un-attentive Bartender!  - Took some time to order! Bartender was busy talking to wait staff and walking in circles around the bar! (My body language should have qued the bartender I was ready to order) - 20 + minutes for the kitchen to get me fried pickles! (Bartender should have addressed this!) - Had to ask the bartender for silverware and plate! (Should have been on the bar top when I ordered my fried pickles!)  - Was charged $.50 for a small ramekin of ranch dressing?!?!?! (some up charges are understandable i.e. sour cream, guacamole, but Ranch dressing.. No!) $2.00 if you want a gluten free hamburger bun! - Burger prices are not bad, but was not going to wait 20+ minutes to try! Was excited about this new place for now just disappointed!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time having Burgers2Beer. Sadly I was lazy and just ordered the food off the yelp app to be delivered. Ended up being a really bad idea.   It took 3 hours to get my food delivered. I'm not sure if that falls on the restaurant or the 3rd party delivery system, but either way, 3 HOURS?   The food itself is decent at best. With the crazy burgers they have on menu, I thought they'd be a lot better.   After all of this it DEFINITELY wasn't worth  almost 60 dollars. Yea, thats right, I ordered 2 entree's and an appetizer and paid 60 dollars."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Unique choices or play it safe and \"design\" your own.  Nice beer selection and there is always something on special - last night was Anderson Valley Amber Ale at $5/pitcher or $1/glass!!"}
{"text":"My 2nd time here. Definitely as underwhelming as the first. My burger was overcooked, and the topping (sloppy Joe) was tasteless. The first time I ordered a bison burger and it didn't even taste like bison meat. I will give the crab dip a plus, def yummy. Our server was not personable at all and forgot many extras we asked for. Overall -  was my visit supposed to be on Bar Rescue?"}
{"text":"Good burgers, Good staff, good prices especially in Monday's.  Different burgers which is cool,  could be a little more generous with the 'mess' topping.  Hot mess is good, loved the one with the peeps, which i tried just to be different."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm really not a beef kinda gal but today I stopped by Burgers 2 Beer on Wilson Mills to grab a bite for lunch and man let me tell you.....the best burgers....so I start off looking at the menu and what's grab's me are the names and toppings on the burgers.....So I asked our waiter/bartender as I was sitting at the bar Greg ( who is the bomb) told me to go with the Luther, now the luther is served on a glazed donut that is cut in half  and toasted with honey pepper bacon and cheese......for a $1 more you can get a full donut as the top of the bun and one as the bottom of the bun...sounds weird  riiiiiiiiiiiiight?? Hardly the sweetness of the glazed with burger was perfecto......loved it!!!! Let me tell ya don't be afraid to go outside the box.....oh did I tell you about the Oh Cheesus Burger ....a burger between 2....yes 2 grilled cheese sandwiches....deelish.....stop on by and check them out.....they have happy hour Tuesday -Saturday 2pm -6pm with tons of specials.....I must admit for my first visit thoroughly impressed.....Big ups to Eeli (hope I pronounced your name right) almost like Eli but with another \"E\" I guess....well you gotta try the boubon beer with a shot of Henny....OMG....I could go on and on but why....stop on in and check it out for yourself.....go to www.burgers2beer.com and sign up for their emails to learn about their upcoming events.........Oh and download the app Belly to earn points not just here but other places as well......So Greg, Eeli, and Eric....thanks guys you rock.....I'll be back and this time I'll get my Groger or 2!!!!!"}
{"text":"We really REALLY love the Highland Heights location. Seriously, it's my go to burger joint in Cleveland. So, when we heard this location was opening up, a half mile up the street from us, we were beyond thrilled! Especially in this neighborhood, let's be honest, there isn't anywhere to go in Willowick for a quality burger with some awesome brews on tap. We have been to the Willowick location twice now, and left feeling disappointed each time.  I'll give the first time a pass. It was opening night, and there were a lot of kinks that hadn't been worked out yet. It's cool. This last visit was a bit of a disaster though. My two-star review isn't for the quality of the food (although, I have yet to have a burger truly cooked to order there. Always overdone, which has never been an issue in Highland Heights), it's for the service and the beer. We went in around 6:30pm, prime dinner time. It started out smoothly enough, but a few of the beers on the draught list weren't actually available. My husband settled on the Breckenridge 471, which is priced insanely high, but whatevs. He says he could taste the dirty beer lines. Fail. Gross. Oh, there was also some issue with the soda water. Apparently they didn't have any because the \"box it comes in ran out\" (our waitresses words). I'm not sure how that happens, but, again, whatevs. When we were all about 3/4 done with our meals, the waitress brought our checks over and started telling us that her shift was over, and she was SO tired, and she had to leave, and she was SO happy to be leaving, and here were our checks! Dropped the checks, and took off. Didn't ask if anyone wanted another round of drinks, didn't ask if we wanted to be transferred over to someone else. Nope. That was it. We were done. According to her. We probably all sat there chatting for another hour... No one else ever came to the table to check up on us... And, we saw our waitress at the bar enjoying her own cocktail!   I sincerely hope this turns around, but I'm skeptical. This location has been so many different bars over the past few years. Always the same crappy service, always the same, weird clientele. It's Willowick, I guess I shouldn't have such high expectations. We'll continue to frequent the Highlans Heights location, but I think this one may be out."}
{"text":"I checked our Burgers 2 Beer on a weekday for a late lunch. The place was what I would call comfortably busy even though the lunch rush was over. The wait staff was very attentive. The menu can be a little hard to get through because it's kind of tightly spaced. But, there is plenty of  things there to partake of. This place has, what some of my friends call \"food in the food.\" That is, they're not going to bring out a plate with a leaf of lettuce and a thumbnail piece of meat and call it lunch.   I had a very basic cheeseburger with swiss and fries. The fries are hand cut and fantastic! The burger was good, beefy, but there is not much of a seasoned flavor to it, the beef is blank canvass as it were. The taste comes from what to you have them put on your hunk-o-beef. Bonus points to them for not overcooking the burger nor leaving it underdone. And, the buns are buttered and toasted.   I had a diet Coke to drink, but there are 12 beers on tap and 75 in total to choose from, including Great Lakes seasonal brews and Yuengling.   My diet Coke never was empty, and I was asked a number of times if my food was prepared as I wished. The dining room was also extraordinarily clean.  For those who lean more toward salads, there are several on the menu. There are also some selections for the young ones as well as some non-beef-on-a-bun selections. By the way, all the beef is grass fed and raised in Ohio.  I'm a fan. I felt I got my money's worth, and the attention made me feel like my business was valued. My only real suggestion is for them to put some stadium mustard on the tables."}
{"text":"Pretty lackluster. I was expecting more out of a $10+ burger. I ordered the Billy Burger with pulled pork, bbq sauce, and beer cheese on a pretzel bun. Burger came without bbq sauce, on a whole wheat bun, and with only 5 small chunks of pulled pork. Their pickle fries had very little pickle in the breading. Most of my order was breading shells. The mozzarella sticks were alright though. I got take out, so I can't say anything about the service."}
{"text":"Great food and service! There were 6 of us and all 6 orders were right on the money. The waitress had a good sense of humor."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night with my family. Our server was Erin who was very pleasant and took good care of us. It was our first time there, let alone our first time at any B2B and we were very happy. Staff was friendly. Food was great! There's a huge variety of both food and drinks (alcoholic and non - including milkshakes and floats!)  We will be back!"}
{"text":"For lunch, this is a decent spot to stop and get a good variety for individuals with varying dietary needs. I love the ability to customize the burgers with toppings/cheese and the prices are pretty fair, but keep in mind all servers won't warn you about up-charged items so be wary of your final bill.  I would give 5 stars but service was incredibly slow and we were only one of three tables in at the time. Two salads and two burgers, served together, shouldn't have taken over an hour."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday. Good little local joint. Decent food and good beer selection. 7 dollar draft beer flights. Cleanliness is slightly lacking.  Floors were sticky."}
{"text":"Another uninspired restaurant to add to this piece of Solon real estate.  The atmosphere is nice, and the menu descriptions will make your mouth water...until the food comes.  The fries were so small I had to eat them with a fork and they were way too salty.  The burger I requested was medium, and I received a cold raw patty lightly grilled on the outside.  It was so raw it wouldn't stay together.  Add an extra $.50 for any sauces or condiments that aren't on the table as well.  I'd rather travel the extra 3 miles to BW3's and get my moneys worth."}
{"text":"We came here tonight for my husband's birthday. I don't know if I have ever had a burger as good as the Like Butta Baby. My husband enjoyed his Eiffel burger and my ridiculously picky children actually ate until they were full and we had to take leftover kids meals home. We were happily surprised to discover that the special for the night was almost any burger for $5.99 with the purchase of a beverage, so the price was much better than it could have been. Also, the host and wait staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Quite a few choices for vegetarians. The bean quasedilla with bean burgers were really good. The sauce was very good as well."}
{"text":"I sit here in this B2B and I think, \"why am I here?\". I ate here only one time before and the food was O.K.; had a burger and fries...whatever. Second time here and I figured I would try the chicken Caesar wrap (i know it's a burger joint) and figured...can't go wrong with a chicken wrap...boy, was I wrong.   The wrap came to me looking like some sad, bland thing that came from a hospital cafeteria complete with brown, wilted lettuce. I took it back for one with fresh lettuce and what came back was almost as bad as the first one. This one had some semi-wilted lettuce and maybe 3 pieces of chicken. At this point I'm beyond over it, so I drink my beer and decide to write this review.   Food is far from satisfying. The workers are incompetent of even making a chicken wrap and don't even care about the customers. Needless to say, I will not be coming back here. Spend your money at the Jimmy John's next door: more food at better quality for a better price."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now. The burgers are just okay. So I switched it up and got a chicken sandwich. The bread couldn't hold it together and it was annoying. The fries are above average.  The place does look nice and I enjoyed sitting their with my friends. There is definitely better."}
{"text":"After a long day of working with bothersome children, I sought out for a satisfying dinner. This is exactly what I found. My experience began with timely service and a cordial waiter, who suggested some killer Mac N' Cheese Bites! The \"Bites\" were delicious, whereas the wings were simply average. The wings weren't exotic, nor unique, nor anything that exceeds mediocre. However, my overall experience warrants a solid 4-star rating. If I ever find myself meandering along Aurora Road, I will be sure to stop by again!"}
{"text":"I gave a three star rating, witch is a combination of to visits. The first was a few months ago,and based on that visit, they would have gotten four stars.It was closer to lunch and there weren't alot of people there.the service was good and so was the food. I ordered the tot mess and my wife ordered the Teri yummy, both orders were cooked well and tasted good . I even tried my wife's burger with a pineapple on it and I don't like pineapple but it was good.     We were there on Saturday and it was busy there was a 20 minute wait. Not a big deal, the service was OK at best but it was busy so again not a big deal. The appetizers were out quickly and tasted good. We ordered the same burgers that we had the first time and they weren't so good. The meat was under cooked and there wasn't as much of the toppings as before. They seemed like they were made quick. We will go back I guess but if there are alot of people and a wait I think we will try a different place."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this since it's in the area.  The restaurant is nice on the inside, yet loud.  The menu is interesting with several different unique burger options.  The waitress greeted us promptly and tried to take our drink order.  I asked about their wheat beer selection and the waitress had limited knowledge, at best, about the drinks.  I finally ended up just ordering a bud lite.  All the unique burgers sounded pretty appetizing and on this particular evening I tried the \"Oh Cheesus\" which is a cheese burger with two grilled cheese sandwiches instead of a bun.  The burger did not have anything else on it and the waitress asked if I would like anything on it so I asked for lettuce, tomato, onion, and a side of mayo.  The burger was tasty and grilled to my liking (medium) and the side of fries, coleslaw, and pickle were also tasty.  Upon receiving my bill I noticed I was charged $10.24 for my $8.99 burger.  I asked the waitress and she said that each vegetable was an additional $.25 charge and the mayo was a $.50 charge.  Being that this was my first time at this restaurant I was a bit unaware of the nickle-and-dime mentality this restaurant had and was turned off because of this.  All in all I enjoyed my meal, but the area competition (Red Robin, Five Guys Burger and Fries) are overall better options when ambiance, service, price, and overall satisfaction is taken into account.  It will, unfortunately, be awhile before I return here."}
{"text":"As a server I would usually never write a negative review of another restaurant. I of course have a very understanding and different outlook since I have worked in the industry for 10+ years.  Most of the time I order togo's from this location because it is on my way home although tonight we decided to dine in. First of all we ordered our drinks and then I went to use the restroom and the drinks still were not there for a few minutes until after I arrived back to our table. We waited a solid hour before our food came to the table. Normally I do not count the minutes but I sent a text message when we sat down so after the table next to us received their food, ate and left already before we got the food or even received a refill on our drinks I checked the time of the text message. Finally the food comes out an hour later the server refilled the drinks at that time and then never even came back to ask how everything was. We did not see him again until our food was gone. He checked on the table next to us but didn't even acknowledge us. Honestly I did not like my burger. It had what seemed to be 1/4 of the Cajun seasoning dumped on top of my burger and it's not even that it was spicy but honestly like eating sand. I scrapped off the majority and ate it anyways since I was so hungry. The fries were cold, you would think after an hour of waiting we might get at least luke warm fries at least. What really got me is he never said I'm sorry for the wait or checked back on us. I normally tip well over 20 percent but I just couldn't do it tonight. Then I wasn't going to write this until after we went through mcdonalds drive through to get desert because we just wanted out of burgers to beer after being there over an hour and a half and they told us there would be a 3 minute wait on 2 of the cookies and the gentlemen threw in extra cookies and apologized for our wait and told us he is very sorry and thank you for waiting have a great night. The man at McDonald's served us better than a real restaurant. I wish I didn't have to write this but I hope this helps you to be more aware of all of your customers there."}
{"text":"Service was ok but the food was bad.My burger was dry and I ordered it medium rare.The cheese wasn't melt at all.I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not knowing there area we wanted to find something for the boys and the adults of our hockey team. We made the arrangements ahead of time for 40. We arrived that evening and after some discussion about how we wanted to be seated we all found our place. I have to tell you that the beer selection is second to none! The menu was perfect as the food was fresh and the prices were unbelievable! When the waitress asks how you want your Burger, you know it's fresh! The turkey Burger was awesome as it was a meal in itself.  The place was surrounded by TV screens so no matter the sport, or show, you were covered. The manager was even so gracious as to put on our hometown team. I can't say enough about the staff, everyone was so accomadating, gracious and for 40 people served us fast.  What a great experience,  thank you to the ALL the staff for an excellent night!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Regularly cheat customers and then manager will defend practice. By \"regularly,\" I mean three weeks in a row. Shameful. Plus, food is garbage. Never again!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty empty. We sat in the back and the bartender served us. The service was so slow. After waiting 10 minutes for an iced tea (they had to make it because they were out) we ended up just drinking water. When the food came out it wasn't all at the same and the food was a little inconsistent. Some fries had no seasoning and others were overly seasoned.  Other than the inconsistency the food wasn't bad but I won't go back because the service was so slow. If it was packed I can understand a little delay but it was excessive."}
{"text":"A buddy and I stopped in to B2B for lunch on a Sunday. This was the first time there for both of us.  It was not busy at all, but it should have been because both of our meals were amazing! I had the \"Oh Cheezus\" and it was amazing. My buddy had the \"Clubbed\" and ordered it without the bun because he is trying to do the low-carb thing. Both meals were presented well, and the waitress was friendly and talkative without being over-bearing. If you are a meat-lover, I would say this is a place for you. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre. Noisy. Too many TVs. Food is just alright. Service is just alright. Prices are just alright."}
{"text":"We were in town from Cincinnati and in search of the best burger. We were very pleased to find this place! Food was great, service was excellent! The manager was very friendly and went out of his way to make us feel welcome. Great beer selections too! If we're ever back in Cleveland, we are definitely coming back!  Btw, the good, bad & ugly burger is amazing!"}
{"text":"Nothing worse than sitting at a wobbly table. But, it wasn't as bad as the service. Came in about 4 o'clock, got some drinks, appetizer, and 2 burgers. Decor is cool I guess, if you like a ridiculous amount of TV's pasted everywhere.  Buffalo chicken dip was meh. Less chicken, more buffalo, of which i didn't care for. I settled for the simple/build a burger with cheese and onion frizzles. Medium. Order came out at a good time after we had finished the appetizer.   Buns tasted homemade and pretty good. Burger was past medium venturing into medium-well land. Most of the burger was bland, and scattered would be a bite of overpowered salty seasoning. The onion straw things were placed directly under the meat making them a soggy mess and far from the expected crispy goodness. The fries were just alright, seasoning was ok.   I would say Kayla(?) was our server, although maybe servers like to be under different names. But at least that's who it was on the bill. Yeah, didn't care much for her service. As soon as she delivered the food she asked if we needed anything else, and then proceeded to dip out to the back to talk to whoever seemed to also be doing nothing. The only time we saw her was when another couple walked in 10 or so minutes later. At no point did he take notice of our low drinks to either offer to refill or to take it upon herself to top them off. Also never really asked how anything was. When she finally decided to remember to actually do something she just grabbed at our plate things while we were still eating the fries. That was super awkward. Still no drinks.  I can't give her the benefit of the doubt in this. Besides the bartender who had her own people to deal with, there was only one other table who most likely got the same flaky presence from her. Got the bill after waiting a while and gladly left.   The service did not in any way make this visit worth it despite the mediocre burgers. Should have went back to Flip Side, it's worth it there. Oh well."}
{"text":"Ordered online through Yelp and it must not have gone through, even though the money came out of my account, but despite that, they fulfilled my order after a short wait. Got the \"Like Buta\" burger and it was so so good. I was craving a burger and this did the trick. I will definitely return, but probably won't use the app. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Got the firecracker burger w/ fries. The wait was a little long for a monday afternoon but once the food came that all was forgotten."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere are great, nice place to eat and relax.  I had their chicken wrap with fries and my wife had one of their amazing Burgers, it had beer cheese on it, she loved it!!"}
{"text":"This was the best burger I've had all year. Excellent friendly cook, and a personable manager. As someone else said, they were pretty aggressive in shutting down at 8pm (I think we were reminded at least 5 times, not exaggerating). However, the food was great, the beer selection was decent, and the staff was hit-and-miss. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The burgers are usually very good.  Service has been inconsistent, and the atmosphere is a little bit loud for my taste.  In my experience, go with Medium Rare on the burger."}
{"text":"I like their milkshakes.  I'm a sucker for a good milkshake. If you looking for a good milkshake.  Then you should definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Great burgers nice flavor combos Wish happy hour menu was more exciting Wings are above average May want to order crispy Recommend  honey bourbon Megan at the bar great service Nice decor Great tvs low noise level Give them a try"}
{"text":"I don't get here often for my taste. Burgers and fries like I like them. Fast, fresh, and tasty. I've been here several times and the food has been consistent. Not a small feat for these small local joints. The bar is a bit limited but it's not a detriment.  Barmaid Melissa was a really good hostess."}
{"text":"First time going here and it won't be the last in regards to the food.  We were seated right away, placed our drink and food order just fine.  Our meals were great, the Oh Cheesus is amazing, 2 grilled cheese sandwiches with a cheeseburger in between, fresh cut fries.... Great meal. Kids had chicken tenders and a cheeseburger, both of which were good. No complaints on the food whatsoever, that alone is why I would come back.   Service on the other hand started ok but ended bad. I wasn't told about the daily special, we didn't not receive drink refills..... we were never even asked. Kind of sucks to eat a big meal with nothing to wash it down with, yet our waitress passes by our table with the empty cup more than once. Kids had food on their plates and we weren't offered to go boxes, I had to ask for that. Just the initial friendliness wore off when it came to our table, our surrounding tables got more of the personable waitress while we got the opposite.   I initially came here because of a website's claim of kids eat free on Tuesday's with the purchase of an adult meal. I received the bill with the kids meals still on there and when I inquired about it, the waitress stated the kids meals were not free, only happy hour pricing for Tuesday's. (I emailed the site that I got the info so they could verify with a manager or update their listing to remove the info if it's inaccurate)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and when we ordered a soda, it came out flat and then we could not get any kind of soda because the machine in the back was broken. But other then that the food was good and the service was very nice and fast."}
{"text":"While the food was perfectly fine... I was very disappointed in the service. Within 8 minutes of sitting down we were asked three times if we were ready to order. We felt very welcomed... after several 'rushed' attempted to have us vacate the table no longer wanted to be there either. The waitress definitely accomplished what she was working towards.... turning the table."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time.  They have $5.99 lunch specials.  I got the burger special.  It comes with fries and a drink.  The only reason I'm giving them a 3 star is because I checked out the menu online before going and decided what I wanted to get.  Once inside the item I wanted wasn't on their board.  The second reason is because there's so much salt on my fries it has rendered them inedible.  I would have to shake salt off of each one.  The burger was great. Next time I will tell them no salt."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in on a whim during a quick trip to Cleveland, and we were not disappointed. She had the black bean burger and raved about how fresh it was, and I had the real fungi which was delicious. We adored the seasoning on the fries and felt the prices were reasonable given the quality of the food. I'd definitely stop back if I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Had their OH CHEESUS burger and it was fantastic!! Nice place, clean, wait staff was very nice and attentive. Like the atmosphere and look forward to going back when it's not lunch break at work when I can dig into their selection of Craft Beers!!!"}
{"text":"I've come here several times on Tuesday nights for Trivia night, and the service was not very good. In my group, we've had orders not come out and wrong orders come out. The server takes a long time to bring out the checks and process them, even when the place is not very busy. The burgers are not very good either, unfortunately! The beer list is pretty good, and there's plenty of space at the bar to watch sports on the TVs, so that's all I recommend doing here."}
{"text":"This was over rated i think. They have a lot of different toppings which is good, but the burger itself is just a typical frozen patty. The chicken strips were very crunchy, and good. They advertise \"fresh cut fries\" definitely NOT. that was disappointing. Service, just ok. We did get there at 5pm, and shift was changing. They have a good happy hour. Any sides is an upcharge. All said for the money we spent, i would rather just go to a good steakhouse."}
{"text":"This place is super close to my house so we are there occasionally out of convenience. They have a great beer selection and decent prices. Their menu is filled with creative (and some weird) burger options or you can create your own. I actually ordered the Natures bounty salad the last few times- the dressing is awesome. When I've ordered burgers they always come out well done no matter how you order it (I order medium, never actually is)- so keep that in mind when ordering. The sloppy tots are also amazing when you aren't looking for something somewhat healthy. All in all the food is okay- the service is usually good and again, great beer selection."}
{"text":"I frequent this place often while I am in Ohio   Their wings have gotten so much better w/ better sauce and seasonings.   Tonight I had the Cajun dry run and it was awesome   The chicken was crispy, moist and the seasoning really made it awesome   I will definitely come back again for their wings and burgers too !"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge burger fan to begin with, but I figured I'd give it a shot.  They have plenty of non-burger items on the menu, and the beer list is extensive.    The burgers were just ok.  My husband and I both liked the toppings on ours, but the burgers themselves were both over-done.  And the buns were soggy and too soft for our liking.  The fries were unremarkable.  Service was fine.    For me the thing that put a negative spin on the whole experience was the atmosphere.  The restaurant is loud, cold, cramped, and just uncomfortable all around.  Definitely the kind of place you want to get in and get out, not linger over appetizers, drinks, desserts, etc.  I wouldn't refuse to return, but I'd never suggest it either."}
{"text":"So let me start out with the fact that we had really good service while we were here. And beer selection was pretty wide as well. But the food was not up to my standards. First of all, cleanliness wise, the menu I was using had flakes of food/dip/sauce on it, which was so gross. Second, we ordered the buffalo chicken dip, which wasn't too bad taste-wise, but you could tell that they just plopped it into a bowl and then put it in the microwave to heat it up. The edges were crispy like it had been put into a microwave ... like the top layer you could pick up with your fork. The bowl was also splattered all around the sides -- they didn't even bother to clean it up and make it look nice. In addition, the chips were stale AF. I ordered the \"Like Butta Baby\" burger. It had \"truffle butter, honey-pepper bacon, brie cheese, crispy onion straws, and balsamic honey jam\". I will say that the burger was not bad, BUT I ordered it medium and it came out well. The crispy onion straws were soggy (which those are my favorite part). I might try it again, to give it a second chance, but we'll see. I hate leaving bad reviews, but this place was just not on it's A game."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp! When over 30 of us went looking for a kid-friendly lunch spot on a Saturday. It was part of a hockey tournament for 8 year olds from Pittsburgh, luckily the place was slow (after lunch, 2pm) and immediately they accommodated us. The service was great. Nicole was perfect! Kudos for putting up with so many kids.   The bar is extensive with tons of beer on tap and so many specialty drinks.   I ordered the \"Good, Bad & Ugly\" Burger with an egg. It was one of the best burgers I have had in quite some time. I highly recommend this place. The fries however were heavily seasoned so if your not a fan ask for light seasoning. :)"}
{"text":"The appetizers are plentiful, the burger choices are amazing, the non burger options are fantastic, and there is even dessert! So many beers to choose from..what's a girl to do? The service is great, fast and friendly! You can have a spicy burger or a sweet burger on a glazed donut!"}
{"text":"So we got a gift card to go back and try it again. Food still rock star. Service still lacking.... as bad as the November visit no."}
{"text":"Have been here twice with work buddies for lunch; and both times I have enjoyed it immensely! The burgers are some of the best I've ever tasted. I even prefer them to Five Guys burgers! The fries could be a little less greasy; but that may have been an oil change due on that day. The servers were fast, friendly, and ours didn't even need to write anything down for a party of 5! Impressive, and everything came out correctly and in a reasonable amount of time, with good heat in all the food. Good atmosphere and ample parking outside."}
{"text":"I stopped here after bridesmaids dress shopping since it was next door. It took quite awhile for our server to appear and when we weren't quite sure what beers we wanted she just walked away. We had no water at this point and it took about five minutes for her to come back after that. After we placed our order she came back shortly to ask us what we wanted to order. Umm what?! She wasn't unfriendly but she wasn't welcoming nor personable nor attentive. The saving grace of the experience was my burger was good and I like that there are so many cool choices. Not sure I would ever come back to this location because of the weird service."}
{"text":"The service is good the beer selection is good and the variety of burgers is good. The happy hour and weekly specials are good with Tuesday having All Day happy hour and $5 Burgers on Mondays. The food is A-Ok just as the 3 star rating states.  I have visited twice ordering completely different things both times but the food just doesn't stand out. The burgers besides having crazy toppings aren't memorable which is a bummer since this is the specialty. During my first visit the wings were underwhelming but on my second visit they were meatier and more flavorful. The Me So Corny corn fritters and pickle chips are probably the best things I have tried there.   I think this is a good spot to come grab a drink with friends but I can't say I would come back for the food."}
{"text":"Update review. After I left my previous review I was contacted by both the general manager & the business owner so I figured we would all give it another shot since they were so nice. We went in about the same time as we previously visited except we had a table instead. The server was amazing. All of our needs were met including charging my phone. We all got burgers since it was burger night & everything was absolutely delicious. We had an appetizer of the buffalo dip which came to the table hot & flavorful. I could seriously eat those all day long. I ordered the vampire hunter & I was not disappointed. My brother & his girlfriend also commented on the update on the French fries for last time they visited without me they were there for burger night & the French fries were previously unseasoned & bland. They were amazing tonight. I have nothing bad to say about this burgers to beer location the second time around & i hope they continue caring for their customers the way they did for us. I can see it now becoming a local spot we often frequent. I would like to thank the business owner & general manager for the gracious invitation back after a first disappointing visit & we left extremely pleased the second time around."}
{"text":"After waiting at the bar for 15 mins for a beer with no luck I moved to a table when my friends arrived.  After slow beer service and no food, our waitress literally walked off the job.  I don't know how you're so ill prepared for a game day.  Disappointing and I will not return!"}
{"text":"This place was okay. I'm not dying to go back, but I would.   I had the black bean burger with the mac and cheese. The burger was actually really good, but too small and the mac and cheese was pretty standard from a box. They have a lot of variety on how to make your burger which is good, but a lot of them didn't look too appetizing. Burger patty sandwiched between two glazed donuts? I don't know, you try it and let me know.  The beer selection is pretty good and growler prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now...most recently at the Cleveland State downtown location and several years ago out at their Highland Heights location (before I was a Yelper!).  First time around I had a Luther Burger (served between a grilled Krispy Kreme glazed donut) which was really tasty as was their fries and cole slaw.  Just a few weeks ago at the CSU location, our meal was not quite as good.  My wife and I split a Vampire Hunter burger and an order of buffalo chicken wings.  The Vampire Hunter burger had real promise...served with creamy garlic sauce, pepperoni, caramelized onions, tomato, smoked gouda and cheddar cheeses...but the burger was very salty (as were the fries) which detracted from the overall taste.  And then the wings...very rubbery (kind of under cooked) and disappointing.  They were plump and meaty, but the chewy nature of the meat was hard to get over.  I'll probably give this local chain one more try in hopes that our recent late night dining experience was a fluke, but with so many other good local spots to choose from, they are gonna have to really wow me to keep me as a customer."}
{"text":"It is always frustrating to wait with no drink or food and watch the waitress checking her phone and then getting engrossed in a you tube video as you sit and wait for her. Ultimately the food was good."}
{"text":"Nothing better than the burger sandwiched between two big fluffy donuts! They have a really good happy hour and it's fun after work."}
{"text":"I really like the set up of the place.  Great atmosphere.  A good sized bar to start at while waiting to be seated.  A great beer selection, especially the bottled beer.  Went on a Saturday night and they were out of a couple draft beer selections.  I could understand a random night during the week but not sure what the excuse is for a Saturday.  They also didn't bring out the appetizer until after we received our food.  The food is good though and the service staff appeared to be solid."}
{"text":"I have been coming to B2B, for both lunch and dinner for a couple of years now, and can safely say B2B serves up some of the most creative and delicious burgers around. They also offer solid beer list, with a variety of craft and local beers, many of witch are available in pitchers. Plus they are on the yelp cash back list now!  If you you are new to B2B just check out their menu. It is way more than burgers. Great apps, tasty quesadillas, wings, even the wraps are good, but the burger choices are the stuff you see on food shows. Burgers made with doughnut buns or Mac n cheese, and the names will make you LOL for real. The also have a rotsting burger if the month.  My usual is getting the pickle fries with the wasabi sauce as an appetizer and The Vampire Hunter as the entre, which comes with garlic sauce, carmelized onions and pepperoni, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. My wife prefers the Holy Frijoles which is a quesadilla served with black beam burger, cheddar jack and this corn/onion salsa, and she adds jalapenos to kick it up a notch. It is also offered as a burger that comes with siracha mayo. The quesadillas and burgers come with a good amount of fries that I scarf down with vinegar. Pair everything with a local ipa or flavorful stout, and call it great day."}
{"text":"Since becoming a vegetarian over a year ago we are still coming here.   I get the great pretender burger which is their veggie patty, super delicious.   I have also had the black bean burger and that was great as well.   The appetizers are still great and the service remains solid."}
{"text":"Well I stopped in for a burger. I got the good the bad and the ugly. Basically burger, bacon, onion rings, BBQ sauce and cheese. It came with a large amount of fries that had some seasoning on them that was not bad.   The burger was done very well and had good flavor I could taste the BBQ sauces and the bacon as well. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good burger. I will say it took a while to get the burger done so plan to relax and enjoy your drink.   It isn't as slow as service in say Europe but it isn't McDonald's (thankfully).   Stop in and enjoy a beer and order some food. They had lots of tvs on the walls as well."}
{"text":"For a place called Burgers to Beer, i'd expect a bit more in terms of a beer selection, but maybe i'm jaded. The burger part they have down just fine though.  Draft selection is pretty so-so, with the standard incredibly large micro brew selection (sam adams, pyramid, harpoon, etc.) it was nice to see Palm on tap, thats unique, but I probably should have opted for a golden mullet which i guess is their house beer or something. Bottle selection is a pretty good representation of the usual crowd of microbrews, and a surprisingly large amount of oldschool domestics (nice!), so of course I had to have a Burger Beer with my burger.  Food selection is really creative for a burger joint, and cheesy fake-knee-slapper titles for just about all the food. The sloppy tots are a winning appetizer for sure, and the lovely titled corn fritters are a welcome oft-overlooked starchy appetizer that i'm glad to see.  The burger selection is sorta like a greatest hits of legendary weird burgers from the classic Luther, to the amazingly delicious Vampire Hunter, the filling Nut Butter (peanut butter and bacon = favorite combination), the mac n cheese topped Krafty, and the completely ridiculous recursive Oh Cheesus, which is a burger between two grilled cheese sandwiches. All creative but in a way that makes the average person think \"yeah, an egg and corned beef hash on a burger would probably taste good\" the fries are well (liberaly) seasoned and might be on the soggy side, if thats a pet peeve for you.  I think the B-Spot comparison is only kiiiinda apt. They both do the fancy schmancy burger in a blue collar thing, but B-Spot has a nicely pressed chef's shirt underneath. its a bit fancier all around, but fancy isn't better, its just different.  its more of a go-here-a-lot-until-you've-tried-most-everything than B-Spot is."}
{"text":"First the great...we all enjoyed our burgers.  Fresh and served fast.  Great beer selection and happy hours... Including Saturday with a dollar of draft and $3 wine.  Plenty of sunlight making it a great place to stop on a Saturday afternoon. The manager stopped by and asked how our food was.  The not so great.. We had a strange waitress.  When asked her suggestion.. She stated that she didn't eat burgers. A point she made several times.  When questioned about a particular choice we were told that she had a \"weird\" relative who liked it.  Later that was followed up with her comments that she hoped the place stayed open, as a few had failed at this location.  As a business owner.. I know what it is like.. and so I didn't let it affect my overall opinion of the place"}
{"text":"Don't like this place.  The layout is completely weird and borderline uncomfortable.  The bar is cramped.  Pretty good-sized beer list but not to the level of a Winking Lizard.  Won't go back"}
{"text":"I ordered the Ter Yumi burger (sorry if misspelled) and it was delicious. The burger was topped with pineapple and teriyaki sauce and it was a very interesting and tangy combo. Loved the beer I had as well and the atmosphere was great. Recommended for anyone!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Each time I've had a solid experience. The burgers were good. The must have at least 15 to choose from. Several different apps as well. All  mainly fried options. They also have a nice beer selection as well. Not a place I'd like to watch a sporting event or anything but a good place to grab a burger. Service was par. Il be back..."}
{"text":"I love the Highland Heights location and I know the owner so it breaks my heart a little to give just 1 star. The service at this location is sub-par - to be nice. I've come 5 or 6 times now and I've seen different people every time. No one ever knows how to work the cash register - or how to apply the yelp coupon. They have a burger of the month posted everywhere (I've counted 4 so far) and I'm told that burger doesn't exist - even when I brought the bartender one of the signs that's posted within the restaurant. There are signs posted everywhere in the restaurant about paying your bill, opening a tab, forgetting your credit card that just make it unprofessional and tacky. The burgers are good, but really not worth it. Annnnnnd they just changed their menu and increased prices. This will probably be my last trip to this location!"}
{"text":"Pizza Burger was good. My 16 year old son wanted chicken tenders which they said they served. After taking the order waitress Mary comes back and said we only sell them as a kids menu option or as an appetizer at Happy hour and since he was neither under 10 and it wasn't happy hour she could sell them to us. I wasn't ordering the chicken tenders because we were trying to be cheap. I was willing to pay the appetizer price or buy 2 kids meals. Instead I was told that he could not have them. :-("}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite burger place.  A large variety of tasty burgers and other treats.  Always promptly seated and served by pleasant people.  Excellent beer selections.  A+"}
{"text":"Two words come to mind when I think of this restaurant:  DON'T BOTHER!    My gentleman caller and I came to this restaurant at 4:30 in the afternoon. The restaurant was almost completely vacant save for a couple people at the bar. We were promptly seated by the waitress that would be serving us. The table was incredibly unstable. It wobbled so much no matter what we did.   We decided on buffalo chicken dip and two burgers. It took a while to get the appetizer which was shocking. When we finally got it, the buffalo chicken dip looked and tasted like it was microwaved and the tortilla chips were dripping in grease. We were never asked how it was by the waitress. We never really saw her but I'll get to that later.   I got the Good, Bad , and the Ugly burger that was supposed to be cooked medium with fries and a side of creamy garlic sauce. I tried the fries and the garlic sauce first...the sauce was more like butter and there was hardly any garlic flavoring at all. The burger was not cooked the way I wanted it at all. The outer rim of the burger was alright, however, if the middle of the burger were any rarer it would probably have started mooing at me.  I would have said something about getting it cooked longer, but our waitress was no where to be found. And no, it wasn't busy, there were only two other tables with two and three people and she was neglecting them as much as she was neglecting us.   The only time we saw the waitress was so she could give us the check and she tried to take our baskets away from us when we still had plenty of food on it. What the hell?  And she didn't even give me a pen to sign the receipt. I had to rummage for a pen in my own purse because she was once again nowhere to be found.   This place sucks and I will not be returning. I was wondering why the place was vacant when I got there and by the time I left I knew why. P"}
{"text":"We found this place looking for a good place to have a burger and a beer that wasn't pretentious. This is just the place, they consistently provide excellent food and service."}
{"text":"Love this place so much! I LOVE the fried zucchini and the wasabi mayo that comes with it is just the icing on the cake! They have great drinks and a large variety of different burgers! And the best part is the service! They are so friendly and the atmosphere is great!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where their menu is just WAY too huge to really specialize in anything, or to even perfect anything. Burgers are greasy, fries are ok. I wasn't exactly impressed with the beer selection either. This restaurant has a chain feel to it and isn't the best place in town for a burger by a long shot. Good for kids and for a quick and cheap bite, however."}
{"text":"Would it kill them to actually add some toppings??  I ordered the Beat Up burger and it came with one sad little tomato slice and one limp excuse for a leaf of lettuce. Good food but cripes stop being so stingy on the toppings... especially when you're charging 0.75 to $1.50 EACH extra.  This is the third time we've ordered from here because they're close to home, but you know, we have a car so we're going to try somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"Look, i'm not gonna sit here and tell  you that this place is the best restaurant I've ever been to, but the food is good and the beer selection is pretty great.   EDIT: I was just reminded of 2 other \"Burger-centric\" places which are all the rage - B-Spot and The Rail. Burgers 2 Beer was better than both.  Danielle and I arrived on Friday night and were seated right away (no wait - bonus points). We perused the menu for a bit before deciding on our meals (truth be told I'd already decided because I'd checked out the menu online before we left the house).  I had the Tot Mess (a burger topped with tator tots, sloppy joe, & nacho cheese). I got my cheese on the side and used it to dip my fries in. in that capacity it was great, but the last thing i needed was more stuff dripping/falling out of my sandwich. The burger was really good. I lover sloppy joe so it was a no-brainer. the problem is that they have so many burgers and i want to try most if not all of them.  Danielle had the Taco My Fancy (a wrap w/ grilled chicken with crunchy tortilla chips, leaf lettuce, shredded cheddar jack cheese, corn & black bean salsa, & sour cream. served with a side of chipotle ranch). I'll be honest, i have no idea if she really liked it. She said it was good but she was hardly raving about it. I'm not a huge fan of wraps but it looked good to me. She did not like her fries. No idea why. I thought they were good. Additionally. they have corn nuggets as an appetizer choice. I loved them. Sweet and crunchy. I'd also tried some beers I'd never had before. First I'd had some brown ale that was a feature special for the month. I wish I'd noted the name because it was really good. Then I had a Thirsty Dog Old Choco Mint Chocolate Milk Stout. Good but not something I'd drink regularly.  Looking forward to going back (Really. I say that about every place i give 3+ stars to, but i mean it). I want to give some of those other burgers a try.  Only one negative for me... young kids. I don't understand why places like this try to cater to kids. You're serving beer, etc. and it's kinda like a glorified bar. Kids shouldn't be in bars. Here however, they have \"Kids Eat Free\" specials and those basketball games and the kids were just loud and i felt that we'd gotten there late enough that kids shouldn't have been an issue."}
{"text":"Huge variety of burgers. Burgers are kind of on the small side for the price. Food was excellent. Service however sucked. We sat at the bar, with maybe 10 customers in the whole restaurant and a good amount of servers. About 10 min to be asked if I wanted a drink. When the bill came. We promptly paid it and waited forever for the bartender to finish arraigning bottles and putzing around before finally taking out payment."}
{"text":"I just arrived in town for a meeting tomorrow. B2B was the closest restaurant open at this hour. I don't eat meat and was thrilled to see they had a black bean burger. I ordered takeout, brought it back to my hotel, and completely scarfed it down. So delicious- the fries were pretty great too. I think u know what I'm having for lunch tomorrow!!!!!"}
{"text":"Actually like the one in Mayfield on Wilson Mills much better. The night I went, parking was lImited. Their were kids running all over the place with no supervision. It was after 9:30p too. That's not necessarily their issue but, they should say something to the parents for the other guests comfort. Our server kept forgetting to refill drinks. She told us to not tip her well. Really? The kids running around was so distracting that I can't even tell you if I enjoyed the food. I believe I got a better portion and burger at Mayfield too. Not sure if I'll try again."}
{"text":"Decent selection of burgers and beers. Fries.. Amazing. Don't agree with the cleanliness opinions of others; seemed well put together and clean to me. Yes it was loud, but its a burger and beer joint, not a romantic restaurant! Service left a lot to the imagination. I think my husband will probably like it a lot. I'd say I'll be back, but not in a huge rush either."}
{"text":"Great establishment. Impressed with the menu size , very large but not overwhelming. Several great burger choices and definitely makes for a great meal. Highly recommend the \"Krafty\". On the other hand, service is very average. But often times seems understaffed. All in all, top notch burger with an average sports bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm soooooo disappointed to review this place as 1 star as Ive had this place book marked since its opened..  Basically my girlfriend and I were seated pretty quickly as it was slow and we order our beverages . next we ordered wings I ordered 5 boneless thai and my girlfriend ordered 5 bone in Buffalo. We told the waiter we needed another minute to look over the menu for our main course as he left and we came back and ordered our main course.  Shortly after that he came back and said they were out of boneless wings but said he would make mine bone in free of charge, I declined as it wasn't a big deal and I didn't really care.  After that a girl brought out our wings as I guess they found 5 boneless , this was the part that pissed me off the boneless they brought were the bottom of the barrel almost all breading wings AND THEY WERE THE WRONG SAUCE!!! Also my girlfriends wings were plain and she ordered buffalo . how do you mess up wings its beyond me  If you mess up wings you really think I'm gonna eat a main course there?! No god this place blew and it wasn't even busy. Never coming back"}
{"text":"Spare yourself bad service, and get your food to go (just check to make sure the order is right!).  First, the good: The fries are great. Perfectly salty and crunchy.   The so-so:  While the burgers are good, they are really skimpy on the toppings.  Mine arrived looking like a plain cheeseburger. I had to pick my burger up off the bottom bun to find a dab of BBQ sauce and a couple of onion straws hiding under there. The \"Good, Bad and Ugly\" concept is a pretty common menu item at burger restaurants, and I've never seen so few toppings.   The bad:  The service was quite possibly the worst I've ever had - anywhere. The hostess gave us a 15-minute wait time, despite there being three empty tables in the bar area. The waiter actually had the nerve to make fun of my husband's beer choice, and then we were given the wrong order. My husband's had to be re-done, so we actually had to eat separately. I didn't see any staff smile all night - not to us, not to other customers, not to each other.   Disappointing, because the menu looks great. I was really hoping to like it."}
{"text":"Fresh Meat!  Literally......what a great burger!   So nice to get a nice combination of ground beef and good cheese with bacon that was actually cooked in house!  Too many places take shortcuts in one aspect or another.  Many beers to try still on the list but there will be plenty of opportunities to visit again.  The server and proprietor was very knowledgable on the beers as one in my party was wanting to try something different but was afraid to stray from her typical Blue Moon.  Planning a visit there soon to watch the draft.   GO BROWNS!"}
{"text":"Visited while touring Cleveland State University with my high school senior and his bother. Wow the food was amazing my sons split the grilled cheese burger they said it was very tasty. They had variety of burger options might try them again."}
{"text":"The food is great. Burgers are fresh and delicious. Have been here a few times, but their food service hours are SO INCONSISTENT! The date is 5/8 at 10:15pm. My husband called earlier this afternoon to ask what time the kitchen was open until-- they said midnight. Great! We walk 15 minutes from our house, hungry and excited for delicious burgers. The sign on the door says late night menu until 2am. How convenient for a second shifter! We walk in and the host grabs menu and walks us to the table, then taps the table with the menus and says to my husband, \"Sorry man, the kitchen's closed.\" We are obviously shocked and so disappointed. He double checks for us. We called and checked. But the kitchen is closed. I've lived here for 2 years and seen this location have 3 different restaurants. If they cant be consistent with their customers, they will fail. 10 months later... Food still good, but I get anxiety every time because there is always some issue. On NYE 2016 I had to make a second trip back after my carry-out order was wrong. I know that was months ago, but just 10 minutes ago I received my delivery in which I requested malt vinegar on the side. There's a giant receipt on the bag with my request on it, but of course none in the bag. A missing condiment is a small issue, but it's the little mistakes coupled with the large mistakes that continue to leave my enthusiasm for this restaurant on a roller coaster ride. TL;DR: Dine in by 9pm, I wouldn't recommend getting carry-out or delivery."}
{"text":"Had the Hot Mess burger (with Sloppy Joe topping it) . It was great, stacked,  fresh,  and delicious.  Burgers come with fries; also very good."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and drinks. Service is on point!! Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good burger and flavorful beers!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite burger place in Ohio thus far.  Excellent selection of brews, the burgers are unique and good quality.  Love the side options and have yet to be disappointed in anything here.  One day when I am feeling particularly adventuresome I will try the Luther - burger sandwiched between two glazed donuts"}
{"text":"My wife & I spied this place driving around looking for a burger place that appeared to be above fast food junk. Boy, did we pick the right spot. What a great selection of burgers. There about 2 dozen different & weird burgers. One with peanut butter & one served on a donut are just 2 of the strange ones. I wimped out and had some kind of mushroom burger that was excellent. My wife bucked the menu & had a Philly cheese steak that she really liked. All burgers are about $10 & you get fries of course. You can also build your own with all kinds of toppings! We sat outside, very nice! Inside is loaded with TVs so you'll probably find whatever game you want. Good food, good service--recommended."}
{"text":"I had the vampire burger , everything on it tasted good. decent sized burger but not huge. Only complaint on that was it was a little over cooked than the medium rare I asked for. Wide selection of burgers including \"build your own\" so can't go wrong!   Other items on menu such as salads and sandwiches but the burgers looked the best. I also had the cheese fries they were pretty tasty as well. ( liquid cheese not melted though from what I could tell)  Looks like they had a decent beer menu as well.  Nice addition to the food choices for us who work in Solon. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Been here twice and not disappointed. Wish someone would post the wifi password on here, though. A little noisy, but no issues!"}
{"text":"Oh look! Another new restaurant opened up in Lakewood. Oh look! Another restaurant opened on Detroit! Didn't that used to be (insert restaurant name here)?  Driving by B2B nearly everyday really didn't have me too thrilled. Another burger joint in Lakewood.... Whoop-di-doo! Let alone just a short distance from Beer Engine. Tonight, figured lets just try it out.  This place is so new you could still smell the paint. For a thirsty Thursday there really wasn't many people in there. It's got a vibrant glow onto Detroit to attract the passer-byers.   Got seated immediately and was seated in the dark corner. Weird, but whatevs. The menu was big and BOLD. Conveniently separated from starters, burgers, and not burgers.   They had a pretty doggone good draft beer list. Lots of local favs as well as some I haven't heard of.   The burger menu had some pretty exotic options from glazed donut buns to burgers with grilled cheese sandwiches as buns! I narrowed down to two burgers - good, bad, & ugly or the breakfast. Good bad ugly had BBQ sauce, bacon, onion straws, tomatoes, lettuce and breakfast had corned beef hash, fried egg and hollandaise sauce. Both sounded amazing! I decided with the good bad ugly.   When asked how I wanted  good I asked for rare. Our server didn't even flinch... Which I loved! I like it red, baby!   Wifey ordered a turkey burger....whatever that is.  Food came out super quick! Probably since there was no one else in the restaurant. The burger had a really good size in which I had to split in half. The redness was perfect and exactly how I like it. The entire burger was tasty! The side of fries could have been a little more, but oh well. We asked for coleslaw and pickle spear on the side (menu says by request only!). The coleslaw was creamy and the pickle spear was really really good!  Nice thing was that all the condiments were on the table... Salt, pepper, malt vinegar, mustard, etc. my favorite was the b2q BBQ sauce! Wow! It was like a sweet chili BBQ sauce. I dipped my fries in it and was quite surprised how good it was. I'm sure that BBQ sauce on burgers or wings would be amazing!  Dinged one star for paint smell, server hadn't tried the chili when we asked how spicy it was (our 3 year old son wanted it), roasted red pepper mayo was left off wifey's turkey burger and they forgot to initially bring out coleslaw/pickle and silverware.   I hope this place survives unlike the other previous tenants. Peeked over at the detroiter on the way out and it was completely dead.   If you want to have a thriving restaurant in one of the most demanding food cities, service has to be excellent and new ideas have to brought to the menu every so often.   Enjoy Yelpers!!!"}
{"text":"I went on a Monday night for the $5 burgers, the burger was good, the beer list for both draft and bottle was very nice and the beer prices were within reason. The staff was friendly and quick and the bartender knew her beer which is always a plus. There was no wait and the bar had open seats. the nice thing was  the bar area was split off from the dinning area so if you went with your family you could have dinner with out having to hear bar room conversation."}
{"text":"Solon location - 12pm Monday lunch - 1 hour long visit for a steak sandwich & wings - water as beverage - horrid service - 4ever to get water then food, oh boy then waiting for bill.  Food was good, but service blew!"}
{"text":"been here a few times - close location and \"burger deals\".  service is horrible and food is SO SLOW, could be better.  Cute burger ideas, but not worth full price - more bar like then food place."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have no idea why anyone would give this place poor marks! Great food, good beer and service is always decent. I've had several different burgers but like the Real Fungi a lot. The burger is tender and juicy and very well seasoned. The fries....oh they are good! They don't require a bit of salt or ketchup. Perfect. I honestly haven't had a bad meal here. I've had some uneven service, but I also understand that restaurants have HUMANs working there, and people get sick, take days off and just have off days. I get it, so I tend to be a bit more kind when it comes to that. Plus I work in the service industry, and honestly, you get what you give. If you treat people shoddily, guess what? You're gonna have a bad time! I can't speak to all the beers, but the selection is varied and plentiful. I tend to get Iced Tea, and it's always good.  I will keep going back, as it's never been a dissapointment."}
{"text":"This place knocks it out of the park as far as bad service. Food took over an hour to get out. If you are a burger place you should be able to turn around a burger fairly quickly. Not to mention the cooks have no clue on cooking temp.  We had empty beers on our table for nearly 30 minutes and the server never stopped back in after she took our food order to see if we needed refills. Not sure how this place is still in business. My entire group was disappointed. This was my third visit to this place and each experience was similar."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my husband and two kids. They finally changed around the structure of this building. Great open sports bar. Our service was excellent. Vast beer selection with delicious fries and fried pickles. Burgers, salad and wings came out timely and tasty. Would definitely recommend for families. We are headed back soon."}
{"text":"I like it here! They are a little pricey,  but their veggie burger is homemade and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots. My husband and I have been here 4 or 5 times, and have always had a good experience. He always gets the Luther (I've never had the courage to try a burger on a donut!) I  usually get \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\" burger, which is a BBQ bacon burger with onion straws on it (SO TASTY!) The last time we went, I decided to go a different route and get the \"Hawiian Homewrecker\" hot dog, and HOLY MOLY it was phenomenal. It's a HUGE 1/2 lb hot dog with cole slaw, bbq sauce, pineapple, bacon, and their \"magic sauce\". So flipping good. I would put their burgers on par with the B Spot, the meat is excellent. They also have an excellent beer list, a bit pricy but most craft beer is. I'm definitely looking forward to our next trip here :)"}
{"text":"The burgers were tasty, pricy for what you get. Good selection of on tap beers  The service was slow, and it already smelled like a bar in a college town (puke and beer) and has only been open for a few weeks.  It is wall to wall 50\" flat screens which I felt was a bit much if you are going for a pint and a chat. screams over the top, too many TVs, sports bar.  It's bar food, nothing special. Makes me miss saaj (the restaurant that it took over) where I actually could eat, pay, and leave in less than two hours. (That's how slow this place is)"}
{"text":"love the food here, especially their fries, don't know why, but they're just better than any other fries I've ever had. also have my favorite burger in the Cleveland area, which is called the Clubed and has slices of turkey and ham on it and is so tasty I can't force myself to try any of the other burgers, which they have a great selection of burgers to choose from and very unique and some of the others sound awesome, so if you have more will power than me, I suggest you try a couple of the other ones first because once you try the Clubed, if you're like me, you won't order any other burger."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great 5 dollar burgers on Mondays. Wish they have a westside location. Food is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Oh Cheesus!  Two sizzlin' grilled American cheese sandwiches with a perfectly seasoned all beef patty in between.  I thought my eyes were going to pop out of my head in amazement.  Then I wrapped my hands around it and slowly went in for that first bite; I was in heaven.  I heard angels echoing as my taste buds erupted in joyous splendor.  In excelsis cheesus!"}
{"text":"After some fun-tastic bridal shopping a few doors down we stopped in for both burgers and beer.  We were in a great mood after playing dress up but the service here, or lack there of, ruined that.  First, when we walked in there was no one to greet us and eventually the bar tender saw us roaming around and came over to sit us.  Our server never cracked a smile or try to exchange pleasantries with us.  She brought us water and walked away.  She took our order and walked away.    But my burger was awesome! After much consideration with all the delicious and creative burgers, I got the \"Oh, Cheesus\" burger between two grilled cheeses.  And there are so many more burgers on the menu that I would love to try: Not Mama's Meatloaf, a Real Fungi, Nut Butter, and a Tot mess.  However, I think I will try these out at another B2B location."}
{"text":"Do not order the fish sandwich. Weird diced tomato and onions. Barely any lettuce,and the sauce was barely there. Plus did not taste good. Maybe this was our mistake because it's a burger joint. But it was terrible. BBQ sauces are weird. A lot of high fructose corn syrup, which you can tell. They say BBQ but it seems more like a glaze.  Are the fries REALLY fresh cut? Seems like they cut some corners and bought skin on frozen."}
{"text":"Food is good, unfortunately the staff working at the time I visited was not very welcoming."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but service was poor. Waitress slapped the menus down and wasn't seen for over 10 minutes. We ordered drinks and that was another 10 minutes. Our appetizer (fried zucchini) was good. Burgers came out delicious and actually cooked to temps requested. A lot of the time, bars/restaurants will overcook the meat but this wasn't the case here. Fries were good. I mean, everything was fine, but just fine. Nothing great."}
{"text":"I got wings and split them with a friend. We wanted to get 15 boneless wings but if you get an order of 15 you have to get them all the same flavor so we ended up getting an order of 5 and an order of 10 which was more expensive. The spicyness rating on the sauces was wayyyyy off. It says it came with ranch and celery but they didn't bring it out and the waitress didn't come back until we were all finished. They also didn't even give us silverware or plates. I give it 3 stars because the food was delicious and the beer selection was excellent and relatively cheap but the service was horrible"}
{"text":"Legit, \"like Butta Baby\" is the best burger I have ever eaten, and I used to work for Red Robin, so I feel like I may just be a burger expert.  My boyfriend and I got takeout and they forgot my dressing, but all was forgiven when I took a bite of that glorious dream come true.  Do yourself a favor and get the bison burger upgrade.  Now, it is a lot of meat in and around your mouth, so know there is no lady like way to eat it this mammoth of a burger, dive in, get sloppy, and enjoy!!! I certainly did!"}
{"text":"Burgers are great. Especially on 5$ Mondays.  Glad they finally came to their senses and offered tots as an upgrade instead of just fries. I have had some horrible service there, but have had some good servers too. Hit or miss I guess."}
{"text":"We watched an OSU game here because the TVs are great and Saturday happy hour was advertised.  They did not have all the happy hour specials yet, which is why went there.Our wait staff was friendly but did were confused about their shift change and we ended up with two bills. Not a bad place, the food was ok.  With all the other options to choose from in Lakewood, I don't know that we'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been here countless times and I'd have to say it's one of my favorites. Service is better at the bar for food and drinks - but all the employees have been friendly regardless in my experiences. One time the bar was full so we got stuck at a table and it took longer to order and get food, drinks, etc. but it was busy! What do people expect? I like trying different beers and the bartenders will give you samples if you ask. I usually stick with quesadillas and the fries are SO good. My friend is a burger freak and swears by their burgers, so no complaints there either. I'll keep coming back to Burgers 2 Beer!"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes, servers walking by us constantly. Not one tried to take our order. We walked the hell out of that dump"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm gonna preface this in saying that I work in the industry, I get it. Still tipped over 20% on a Togo, still gonna give this place 5 stars because who am I to fuck up your ratings, but I want the employees and managers to see this review and take it for what it is.  I like this place, I like the food. The last handful of times I've come in, usually for Togo's and a drink, there has been some sort of issue in the correctness of my order that I didn't see until I got home. I see some reviews echoing my complaint. I don't care if the bartender wants to chop it up with me or not, but I do expect to be acknowledged within 5 minutes if the place is pretty dead otherwise. And I also expect that my order is going to be right 90% of the time. If you forgot something, come back and ask, it's not a big deal. I'd rather someone ask than get the wrong thing. These people need training or something, it's not necessarily their fault aside from the nonchalance in acting like I'm just sitting at the bar doing nothing for a good time. But otherwise, teach these people the steps of service. Also, we're in a burger place, asking the temps and what kinda cheese, ect should be things asked on autopilot if you're not brand new. I just dont get that. I'm hungover and a little cranky, I don't want to be a dick and run a smear campaign. This is my second yelp review ever and the first was praising the Fuck out of this random restaurant in michigan. Im unhappy I feel compelled to say something to begin with, but I don't know what else to do. I want to support your business and tip your people well, but in return I want what I came for, okay. I still love you tho, but get your shit together"}
{"text":"My husband visited this establishment regularly while he was accompanying a family member to the Cleveland Clinic. The staff was great and very accommodating. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"First time coming to this place and it wa amazing! I was a little nervous from reading other reviews but it was the complete opposite. I had the good the bad and the ugly which was very tasty. It was full f flavors. I must say though if you out it in the fridge and come back to it a couple hours later it isn't the best. The burger to me had no flavor so eat it while your there."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill over the pst several months. The service is incredibly slow, food quality has dropped & prices have increased.  The burgers used to be really good, now I would rather have a 5 Guys burger. It tastes better and is cheaper. Consider other options."}
{"text":"We walked in and were greeted right away. We decided to sit in the bar area since it wasn't crowded. I ordered the chicken taco wrap and let me tell you...it was awesome! It was huge so I had to take the other half home. My husband ordered the large buffalo ranch wings and he ate them all. He absolutely loved them! He's picky with wings so I knew they were good. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was good, restaurant is clean and it is decorated like a fast food sports bar. Nice job David"}
{"text":"I met some friends here to see what all the fuss was about. The menu was very extensive with lots of crazy combos of burgers, salads, wings and the usual suspects. I finally decided on the crazy burger with potato skins and sour cream inside! Not bad. Fresh cut fries. The apps we got were so so. Nachos could have used more \"stuff\" on them and the macaroni bites were as expected. Vibe was decent. Not super busy on a week night. Would go back."}
{"text":"They must have responded to the comments about service in the front, because we were greeted and given the option to order at the counter or have a seat and get table service.  We opted to sit down, and the service was fantastic.    We ordered beers and they were brought right out.  We ordered our food (Mondays they have $5 burgers, which is half price). While we waited the waitress offered us cole slaw and pickles.  The burgers came out soon after.  I did not time it, but I would say from order to the table was about 15 minutes, maybe less.  The burgers were excellent, as were the fries.  The beer selection is quite good."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday early afternoon and sat at the bar. I ordered a beer and my husband a pop. We order a couple appetizers that came out after awhile of waiting, and about 30 seconds after that our burgers came out. So once we were done with our apps, our burgers had been sitting there for a bit. They weren't hot like they should have been if it was timed better.   The food was okay, service was ehhh. Probably won't make it a regular stop."}
{"text":"Great place we found on Yelp! Son wanted wings and hit Cajun dry rub,crispy skin and juicy in the inside. I got the Like Butta Baby Burger and was blown away by the flavors. Will be back again!!!!"}
{"text":"Burger was the worst dry never asked how I wanted it you kno well done medium, it was supposed too be between to grill cheese sandwiches it was more like 4 pcs of dry sandpaper like toast with the thinist pc of cheese on it came with bacon but i had to ask for tomatoes and onion very sad for a place that's supposed too be known for its burgers, wings were good & sloppy Joe tots were flavorless! You want a good burger try fatheads"}
{"text":"Now I am certainly not proclaiming I am Donald Trump but I know a little bit about business and customer service. If you are a business open until 2am and you have 14 people come in at 11:45 with kitchen staff still around would you turn them away? I have customers come into my store at 5 minutes until close and I stay open an extra hour if need be to take care of my customers. More importantly as a business that is not a charity is it not the goal to make money??? If you are the owner of this location let me ask you are you not trying to make money??? If you are the manager of this location is it not your job to make money for the owner??? I think if I owned this business I would look into employees that were more motivated to make money for me. We not only walked down to the Rascal House Pizza place and dropped a couple hundred dollars but then went and had drinks until 2am were we dropped a couple hundred dollars more. Aren't you open until 2am??? Could you not have easily taken care of my group and probably made $400-$500??? It is a shame how piss poor customer service is sometimes!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I have ever received. The female bartender was beyond slow. And twice forgot our drinks. And the male bartender/toilet cleaner was a total smart ass. Just had an attitude for no apparent reason whatsoever. Especially after we stayed for the whole game and gave them plenty business. The food was good. Just make sure you don't sit at the bar area."}
{"text":"First off let me just say I've come to this place many of times trying to see if anything will get better and out of the 6 times I've been here I've only been happy 2 times.   I came in here tonight around 10:45 pm with my friend and we just wanted milkshakes, we sat at the bar and ordered our milkshakes when the bartender tells me she can't make them because the kitchen has put everything away and is closed. My friend and I continue to just sit there talk surprised that the kitchen is closed so early and they can't grab some ice cream and cookies from the back but we sit there and continue to have a conversation.  Around 11:20 I see an order of wings being served to the couple next to us, and got very confused. About 10 minutes later at 11:30, she comes around and says its last call the kitchen is closing so if we want to order we had to right now, which clearly made me even more confused because I thought it had closed 45 minutes prior when she told me she was unable to make my milkshake. I just got up and left and I'm not even sure I'll ever come back, I'm in the restaurant industry and I know how industry works. I never have wrote a review even after having a bad experience 4 times out of 6 at this place, but tonight just pushed me over the edge.   The bartender should focus more on making her hopefully returning customers happy instead of mingling with her friends and making sure they get food while I had nothing even 45 min before the kitchen \"closed\"."}
{"text":"When here on a whim with my family I was greeted by a pleasant hostess taking a directly  to our seats. The place was clean and the atmosphere was pleasant. We gave our drink orders and we are given the menu upon looking at the menu I noticed they had the Luther a cheeseburger with bacon and onions placed in between a glazed donut so I ordered that my burger arrived it was cooked two temperature that I requested biting into the burger it was properly seasoned and you got that salty sweet sensation from the burger and from the glazed donut. The four of us had  four burgers four orders of fries and four drinks before tip the bill was $41. But I cannot say all good things my only qualm with the places is that they put the food in plastic baskets giving it that cluttered look  I would much prefer the burger and fries to be plated I think a little bit of presentation would go along way but that is my opinion other than that I  will back"}
{"text":"We went Burgers 2 Beer with another couple to watch the World Series, and while there were plenty of TVs to choose from to watch the game, I probably wouldn't go back due to the service, which is a shame because the beer list was great and the menu - especially the burgers - were very creative. I really liked how the menu provided beer pairing suggestions with each recipe, too. I tried the burger with peanut butter on it, and it was actually delicious!  However, we had the kind of service where our waitress seemed to purposefully avoid eye contact with us and went about tasks like sweeping the floors instead of checking on our table. It must have been close to the end of her shift, but her relief waiter was not much better. He pretty much got every single drink order wrong multiple times.   I hope this place can pick up on the service because it's got great potential."}
{"text":"The food is actually really tasty, which is why the review gets two stars. Got wings and nachos as appetizers, and I do have to say the sauce (garlic parmesan and teriyaki) were really good!  Kids meals were typical of any burger place. My husband ordered the bison burger medium rare and it came out so well done it was impossible to eat. When the new burger came out, it was so rare that it was dripping blood when my husband picked it up to eat.  The service was atrocious!!! While our server was nice when she was around, the issue was she was never around. Never brought refills, didn't clear plates even though they were stacked at the end of the table to make it easy for her, had to flag her down for everything!! And it's not like they were busy, there were two servers and three occupied tables.   The \"BEST\" part of the experience is later when I checked my bank account there was an additional $25 charge to my card, like she accidentally swiped my card for another table. Again let me mention how NOT busy they were. While the charge was credited, the was no mention of this happening. No apology saying what happened. At least have the courtesy to tell the customer!!!"}
{"text":"I have to admit it: the overall experience you'll have at B2B is average. I would use all of these following words to describe the food at B2B: common, commonplace, customary, dime a dozen, everyday, fair, fair to middling, familiar, garden*, garden-variety, general, humdrum*, intermediate, mainstream, mediocre, medium, middle of the road, middling, moderate, nowhere, ordinary, passable, plastic, regular, run of the mill, so-so, standard, tolerable, undistinguished, unexceptional, usual.   Beware of average meals."}
{"text":"Went to this location with another couple, before a show at the Wolstein Center.  This location operates similar to a cafeteria style - you place your order, pay, receive a number and beverage cup.  You get your beverage and when your number is called - get your food.  Long story short is that we had a 45 Minute wait for our food - two burgers with fries. People coming in after us received their food long before us.  The others in our group were done with their food (they ordered after us as well) by the time we received our food. Many people walked out when they learned there was a long wait, and other customers were equally as frustrated waiting.   The manager was rude and offered no apologies - nor has any corporate management.  To spend $25 for cheeseburgers and fires and wait that long, and be treated rudely when you inquire about your order is unacceptable.  We go to many events at the Wolstein Center but will not go back to B2B"}
{"text":"I've never had the beer half but the burger half is scrumtrulecent! The donut burger will probably give me diabetes the next time I have it but I'm willing to take the risk."}
{"text":"I have only had their ribs and every time I return I buy the ribs. I'm caught in a loop. I dream about these ribs. I call my friends to meet me and split a Groupon for a BOGOF. THE RIBS ARE SPECTACULAR. Sweet, spicy, oh hell both!"}
{"text":"The place serves good burgers.  I went for lunch and was immediately seated.  The burgers are cooked to your liking and you can swap out the fries for the vegetable on the menu."}
{"text":"Wanted something quick and easy. Since the revamp I haven't been by so I thought I'd give it a try since my parents went the week before and enjoyed the change.  Beer list...there are plenty to choose from but some were a bit pricy I thought. I went for the Christmas Ale which was seasonal and I was on vacation so thought what the hell.  We split our meals for dinner. I wanted to try the Tiny Taco Salad. I will get it again! The tiny chips were folded in half with beans inside and the salad was simple-with corn and salad veggies served w/chipolte ranch. He thought the Breakfast burger sounded good...and we were both happy with our choices and stuffed!  I'll be at the gym for the next eternity if I eat here often but I will be back to try it again. Good Luck B2B!"}
{"text":"Burgers are ok. Fries good. But, 50 cents extra for mayo on your burger?  That's ridiculous and greedy. No parking available during lunch time.  Lots of other places to get a burger and beer. Won't go back"}
{"text":"Delicious. Delicious. Delicious. Lip smacking good. A fun place. Let's put it this way I want to go back and try another burger. I also want to try their wings and fried pickles and pretty much everything else on their menu. I love a place that has a roll of paper towels on the table and not only that, but malt vinegar for the hand-cut fries. I had the GOOD, BAD, & UGLY burger and one of the many reasons I enjoyed it so much is because it was messy, but not too messy. I am not a fan of a burger that gets everywhere and you feel afterwards like you need a shower. This burger was excellently constructed and superbly cooked. Plus the service was so fast. Also the food came out hot. It's a huge pet peeve of mine when the food comes out warm or dare I say even cold. That is what I really want to focus on here the service. The minute we walked in and were so quickly greeted I knew this was going to be a pleasant experience. What I mean by that is the young woman who greeted us and ended up being our waitress was so nice and down to Earth. I liked when I said you've been waiting for us and without skipping a beat she said I was bored. She wasn't a corporate robot. She was a real human with two beautiful children and she made me and my friend feel at home. At one point she even sat down at our table and chatted and it made me want to be there and not rush off. And you could tell she wasn't doing all of this for a bigger tip, but instead because she was genuinely a cool person and that is so rare in these days of fast food chains and their unremitting desire to make the customer feel like just one more number. I also found myself quite smitten with the bartender, but that's a story for another day and a different burger or wings or perhaps a wrap. Oh and my friend had a SON OF A BEACH cocktail (yes it was that kind of a day) per the server's recommendation and said it really hit the spot."}
{"text":"I read about a dozen reviews before deciding to give b2b a chance even though I was skeptical. My wife, daughter and myself got there around 7 PM on a Saturday and the restaurant was not real busy so we were able to get a table relatively quickly. I asked the hostess if we could sit a a booth that was just being cleared and she rolled her eyes at me and walked away to talk to another server in the bar with her back to us and never came back. Luckily a bus boy noticed what happened and came over to assure us he would get the table cleared right away....nice save by a genuinely nice guy. The waitress was nice and prompt but wasn't real knowledgeable about the menu but overall the server was average but needed much better training. I ordered the Bison burger which was cooked perfectly and had a ton a flavor especially with the bacon. The meal went great with my IPA. My wife got the Simple Sally burger with a salad. She said the burger was really good and but the salad came out with no dressing. My daughter got a cheeseburger and cookies and cream milkshake and said it was very good. Bottom line the food is very good but I would not drive 20 minutes and pass 20 other restaurants to go there again because of the service. If they improve the service I would give it another chance. Service is almost more important than the food for me so I can't overlook it. Whoever manages this place is missing a huge opportunity and doing the business a disservice. I wish them luck"}
{"text":"This is mostly about a server experience.  I was really looking forward to going to this place! Burgers are one of my favorite foods and they had my favorite beer, Freshly Squeezed.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table even though there were empty tables. When we were seated it took a while to get our waitress over.  She finally came and took our order.  My mom accidentally ordered the wrong drink.  When told this to the waitress she snapped back 'I can't comp alcohol'.  I was in the restaurant industry for over 15 years.  I would have never said that to a customer.  She argued with my mom about what she ordered until I finally chimed in and told her we don't care about the comping just get her the drink she wants.  10 minutes later the drink came.  She was not apologetic.  The burgers were good. But she was not. I'll sit at the bar next time, if there ever is one."}
{"text":"When they opened, in Highland heights, the food was phenomenal. I really loved it.  Would have given it 6 stars.   Now, it has declined into just another burger place with so so food.   I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.   Good service for a change on this visit though. But we won't be back."}
{"text":"Had a great time with our waiter James! He had a great personality and was very funny! I got the Tot mess and loved every bite. Can't wait to head back in!"}
{"text":"Food is meh, tables are dirty, service is below average and no ones in a hurry to help. If you have nowhere else to go come here.  Took a star off for mishaps the last few times here: wrong change, wrong items served and a 55 minute wait during lunch with no explanation or as much as a single check-in from the waitress or management. Service is seriously lacking."}
{"text":"Great burger choices, tasty fries and slaw, and a long list of beers. Just one shortcoming, private label ketchup instead of Heinz."}
{"text":"Went to Burgers 2 Beer for lunch on a Friday. I was glad to see something finally come into the vacant spot left by Eddie Cerino's, and I was not disappointed. I'm a fan of the rather large and somewhat overwhelming menu given that there are a number of things on here that I want to try; this is also the only place in Lakewood that I know of where you can get a wrap. I had the \"cod i have your number\" wrap (note the clever menu names), which was much better than expected. The cod was delicious: breaded well and not soaked in oil as you would find with fried fish at many other places. The fries were well seasoned and a perfect accompaniment, and I love the serving sizes at this place...enough to leave you stuffed. Definitely can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great burgers cooked fresh, had a going away for a coworker and the owner was great, very accommodating."}
{"text":"They have a great beer selection. Their burgers are really unique and delicious. I got the oh chesus, which is two grilled cheese sandwiches and a burger in the middle. DELICIOUS!! We will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"We had a great time here for dinner. The burgers were all cooked to order and the fries were delicious. The Mac and cheese was SO good. They make it themselves with a bunch of different cheeses! The one at the table who got the strawberry salad said it was absolutely delicious and would order it again, even at a burger place! The beers were cold and tasty, love the selection! Our server was very friendly as well as other staff we interacted with! Cool place for burgers and beer (obviously-B2B) lol this was a good night for them, A+"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times since it's opened and with each visit it gets worse. I've decided today will probably be my last visit. The service is horrible and it took over an hour for burgers. Once received the fries were cold, no once did the waitress come back to offer refills. We had to flag her down with each visit. The Malibu bay breeze was entirely juice. The food once received besides the cold fries was pretty good but that was about it. It was far to empty on a Sunday for the service to be this awful."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend have been to Burgers 2 Beer twice so far, our first experience was actually awful, we were sat, and ignored by a server who could of cared less to come over and ask us for our drinks. We finally got our drinks and ordered our food, two cajun burgers with friends. There was so much cajun on it that it that it felt like eating a massive block of cajun. Fries were soaked with oil. We were disappointed and met with the manager of the place who was friendly enough to take the entire bill off. Fair enough. We promised to come back...So we did.  The second time was far better as we got better food, better service, and the same woman remember us to say hello which was a very good experience to know that we weren't just talked to and forgotten. The restaurant I think had a rough time getting off its knee off launch and deserves a 2nd or a 3rd chance before being dismissed. I'll continue to come back here and try the other menu options. I really want to LOVE this place but two isn't enough for me to completely make the claim so I weighed it with our two experiences thus far. We will return and I would keep this updated.  Also, I guess we all have the same issue with the wobbly table. X)"}
{"text":"The beer was cold and reasonably priced. The fries were some of the best I've had in a while. The waitress, who was taking care of a lot of people was pleasant and on point. Ah, but the protein ........... I ordered the buff chick sandwich. While eating the 1st half I assumed the chicken slipped when I cut it in half. But alas, I lifted the hoagie roll to see a 1 or 2 oz portion of chicken. I asked the waitress if that was normal, she got the manager. He informed me it did look smaller than normal, but it's just a patty cut in half, then walked away. $8 for a 2 to 4 oz chicken sandwich and fries? Sorry, there are way better options out there, never again."}
{"text":"I AM a fan. Good food, nice ambiance, and lots of choices of different kinds of burgers and how they serve them. VERY interesting menu for those who like to try something different. I hear the peanut butter burger is actually very good!  I prefer my burger over a salad. Beer choices are terrific. Place is small but it works. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Very cool place. Insane selection of Burgers and brews. I had the vampire, she had the breakfast. Both were cooked perfect, came out fast and tasted great. Definitely in the top 5 of burgers I've ate.  Next visit I gotta try the Burger served between a donut.  Check this place out. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and always had a good experience. But, today I had a GREAT experience. You can tell they are understaffed here and our server still was exceptional. I don't think I've ever gotten food as fast as I have here and the prices are very fair. Great place, never gets busy at all(poor location in my opinion, too much competition in the area)."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch and I wasn't impressed with the order taking at all. Not a hello how are you, or anything. The staff doesnt look happy at all. The taste of the burger should have been better. If I am paying $7.50-$8.50 for a burger it should not come to me overcooked and bland tasting, and it shouldn't take 20 min to cook.  Try their Hot Dog, it's very good with a lot of toppings too."}
{"text":"Come here to get your weeks worth of recommended calories in one sitting. Obviously outrageous selection of specialty burgers, including 2 grilled cheese sandwiches as the bun to an already cheesy grease-filled cheeseburger. Cheese for days. My personal favorite is the glazed donut-bunned burger completed with bacon, and also - more cheese. Interestingly delicious sweet, salty, meaty mess.  Was a little disappointed in that this location doesn't have all the selections you read about on their online menu, like the breakfast-themed burger with an egg, syrup and a couple slices of French toast as the bun. Nonetheless, it's a fun little place to step out of your office job and sneak a beer in with your calorie infused lunch break."}
{"text":"Tried it again and was much better. Loved the tiny taco salad. Service continues to be a challenge. Sat outside and enjoyed the wx. Didn't get silverware,  when I went inside to get silverware, loved the \"thought I brought that out\". Why is the customer always wrong. was not bothered by the server. SO just took the check inside following a lengthy wait. Fungi burger was above average and ff are good.  We will come again and will try not to expect too much by servers. Beer selection was good. Drinks are good therefore 4 stars."}
{"text":"There are few things better in life than a fine hamburger. So when I saw the Burgers 2 Beer location going up near my work in Cleveland, I was eager to give them a shot.   I gave them plenty of time to work out the new store kinks before making my debut at Burgers 2 Beer.  The day I walked in they weren't too busy, it was just before 1pm.   The place has the industrial rock feel (as soooo many places do nowadays) when you walk in and it's rather confusing as to where to go.  There's a Subway-type line past a glass case where there are condiments and waaaay at the end of the line there's a register.  Nobody directed me, so I just walked down toward the register. I had snagged one of their menus that were placed near the big menu board at the entrance, but once you were down near the register, you couldn't see the big board anymore.  I read the selections from my little menu as two ladies placed their order in front of me.  Pricy.  Lots of fancy-named burgers with non-traditional toppings, hrmm...  Okay... Lets try the Vampire Hunter (garlic spread, pepperoni, smoked gouda and chedddar with caramelized onions, sounds good enough).   When it was my turn, a bored cashier took my order.  I was suspicious when they didn't ask me for the temp.  I get it, you can't order a Medium burger at McDonalds or Burger King, but for the price I paid?  Come on.  The burger came with fries and my order (I added a small fountain drink) came to 12.90.  I swiped my card and there was a spot to add a tip?  There was a tip bucket, too.  Uhm... okay...  I'm all about taking care of my server, but simply bringing my food to me because I have a plastic numbered tent on the table doesn't qualify as being waited-on.   Anyway, my burger arrived curiously fast and I ascertained it probably came from a warming drawer.  I took my burger to the condiment station where they have a small pickle-ish bar with dill spears, chips, pepper rings, peppers and slaw.  I grabbed a pickle, some pepper rings and a little slaw along with some ketchup for my fries. My burger was well-done.  Meh.  The cheese wasn't melted... in fact, it was in that greasy pre-melt stage.  Overall, the burger's general taste was okay... not bad, but certainly not worthy of the price they're asking; the fries were rather good, though.  I didn't finish my burger.  While eating it, it dropped like a stone in my stomach, and now, four hours laster, it's still sitting very heavy.   Between the disinterested cashier, the well-done, super-expensive burgers, the played-out industrial rock/sheet metal decor and general lack of quality in the product, I won't be back.   BSpot serves an unbeatable burger for about the same price, cooked to order, with real servers, and a real pickle bar, go there, avoid B2B."}
{"text":"Came here multiple times this past week as I was visiting Cleveland for a seminar across the street. Always super service and great place to hang. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I come here pretty often, whether it be with my wife or friends.  The things that are always consistently good are the burgers and fries.  I've had the chance to try about 7-8 different ones at this point and I'm never disappointed. Fries are always cooked to perfection and delicious, especially with a little malt vinegar.  Now, the issues.  The service that you get it inconsistent to say the least.  On some visits the servers I've had are extremely inattentive and distracted.  They have an expansive beer list, but I've had multiple occurrences when I've asked to try a new beer and they've been out.  On several occasions I've had to ask for 3 or 4 different ones only to hear the same thing.  I will gladly keep coming back for the food, but consistent service and beer availability would certainly raise my rating."}
{"text":"Upping to 4 stars. I've been back two more times since my original review.  We decided to try the wings with sweet and tangy BBQ sauce. My husband is veeeeerrrrry particular about his wings not being soggy. Well, he was not disappointed at B2B - they cook and sauce the wings perfectly here. The wings have a little bite and just enough sauce to coat them.   Service was great as usual. We sat on the patio once and our server checked on us often even though we were the only ones out there."}
{"text":"I tried this conveniently located Lakewood eatery because I love burgers and love beer. I will say that the selection of burgers is amazing as they have come up with many original and unusual concoctions. I went with the Nutter Butter which is a burger with peanut butter on top, it was original and fun to try  if you are seeking something different. I have to mention the staff and service because it was top notch. It was a Thursday night and they were not very busy but we had multiple people check in on us several times for refills, to answer questions, and offer suggestions. It was comparable to fine dining. I'll be back. There are at least a half dozen more burgers to try..."}
{"text":"Got in and seated in a dark corner... And ignored for 15 minutes. It was long enough to read the menu and get totally turned off. Went to Deagan's instead."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! Excellent service, little to no wait. Very friendly employees and the food is always good!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at B2B and was waited on by Sasha and Destinee (trainee). Love the burgers here and the sloppy tots are a must order.  Good portions and tasty food.  Plus they do have a huge drink selection.  Can get a little loud if you are near the game area.  Lots of big screens for sports fans.  Stop in some time and check it out."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this spot. David Lopez has created a vibe that keeps customers returning. Add the five star food and their incredible stock of imported beers, our family loves coming in for a quick bite or to watch the game. Thank you for always being consistent and a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe every time we walk into Burgers 2 Beer. My kids love Melissa, Eddie and most all of their staff. We are always treated like family when we pop in wether it's for a sundae or dinner, the food and service is always impeccable. Love that we can catch every game on one of their 32 TV's and our friends have a blast tasting their imported beers & discovering new flavors. Great addition to the city of Solon - if you're looking for good food and an even better environment, bring your family into b2b!"}
{"text":"I went to Burgers 2 Beer for the first time yesterday, and the last time at this location.  The service was terribly slow and it took us almost an hour to get our food.  There were people who came in after us who were served first.  The food itself was o.k., nothing great but not disappointing either.  The problem was after eating, about an hour or so, I was completely sick to my stomach for the rest of the afternoon.  I had diarrhea and took a trip to the john multiple times at work.  The burning sensation seared my bunghole beyond recognition.  I don't suggest eating here unless you have a 12 pack of TP and no plans for the night."}
{"text":"Great burger.  Good fries.  The place was clean and the service was good.  Next time I'm in Ohio,  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a happy hour with unique burger combinations and solid beer selections. I've been here several times and can say that the service is sometimes a hit-or-miss, but the food has always been perfectly cooked to order. June's special Oinkeroni burger (burger with creamy macaroni salad and smoky bbq pulled pork) is probably my favorite!  FYI, don't forget to ask for a pickle and cole slaw on the side - they're complimentary with your burger when you ask!"}
{"text":"I am new to Lakewood & found this place via Yelp. Due to the good reviews, I decided to order take out while my family is visiting from out of town. The food was made pretty quickly. The negatives: medium rare burgers were very rare, they gave you little to no cheese on the burgers, the bun to meat ratio was completely wrong (at first I thought it was just a bun no meat), the French fry order was wrong and soggy & we paid extra for sweet potato fries that we didn't receive and worst of all, my mom & husband found multiple long hairs in their burgers! So needless to say, I won't order from here ever again."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, friendly & helpful staff, the Hot Chick was delicious, and the Oh Cheesus was very good."}
{"text":"Food was really good, came out very fresh/hot. Our server was super nice and attentive. The place is very nice, big and clean! Will def go back to try all the other crazy creations they have here. Only thing my group and I didn't like was a couple of the burgers lacked toppings/flavor. No special sauces that matched the ingredients. The \"oh cheezus\" literally had nothing but bread and cheese, the grilled cheese sandwiches had one not too melted piece of cheese. No lettuce tomato(bacon would be good too!) or anything on the side to add... The person who got it just said he wished it was cheesier. The Eiffle toast was good, but again something with missing with the sauce? Came with syrup but it just didn't do it to top that sandwich. Good but not the best I've ever had. Still want to go back and try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Good restaurant. Excellent burger. Very good beer selection.   Only problem I had was the ambience. It just had a very quiet atmosphere - you could hear folks shuffling around and the music was dreadful.   Also, they charged me $0.50 for a side of mayo - ridiculous.   May go back because of their good quality food but they should get a restaurant consultant to come in and do something about their ambience. I'm sure they are missing repeat business because of it."}
{"text":"Went here on new years day to grab a burger. Got in before the OSU game started. Tasty $5 cocktails (in pint glasses, mind you) and good burgers. The fries have large grain salt and were well prepared. I had the Oh Cheesus, which is a burger to be reckoned with. Seems a bit like a rip off from Melt but I didn't care, it's a burger between two grilled cheese sandwiches (with more cheese on top of the burger)    ...I made it healthier by adding spinach on top. Basically health food at that point.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great and friendly staff!  A lot of personality! Flexible with substitutes and order modifications. Quick service and good hot burgers. Mac and cheese bites were perfect and fresh and love the sea salt on the fries.  We are from out of town and found this place on yelp a short walk from our hotel and were not disappointed. Good beer selection as well for their setup.  Not far from the stadium we where we were attending a concert, only a small detour for a preshow meal. They also honored the 20% off check in promotion which was a happy bonus. Great first impression and will be back the next time we find our way to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I would have given this restaurant more stars but sitting at a booth while the pregnant server flirted with two greaseballs at the booth right next to ours for 20 minutes killed our appetite. It was so annoying, all we wanted to do was get our food and leave."}
{"text":"Burgers 2 Beer is my automatic go-to when I'm on the CSU campus. That being said, this is still an awesome place even if you're not a student or staff of the university, and in fact, the crowd is often more of a business class. The food tastes fresh and the beer selection is great, especially for the area, which is kind of lacking in neighborhood bars. But my favorite part is definitely the staff. Everyone has always been super welcoming and friendly, and you can tell they genuinely care about their business."}
{"text":"It's your standard chain with overpriced burgers and pretty descent fries. I really don't think there is anything I can offer this review. They do have a veggie burger but it has a weird almost slimy consistently and the burger was suppose to have broccoli on it. I had one piece of broccoli on my burger and I had to request more from my server--she was great about getting more though. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Honesty, nothing special about the burgers. I was expecting a burger experience.  All I got was an average patty with decent topping. Actually the patty wasn't great. Didn't taste fresh. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there. Actually even if I was right next to it is probably go next door to the Thai place or Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"I think the previous reviews on here are a little harsh. At least there is a restaurant right now that is occupying the space. Or would you rather it remain empty..   Anyway. I came with my grandparents yesterday. Saturday 11/28. We had Cody as our waiter. All I can say is that he knows how to do his job, and do it well. The entire dining experience was executed handbook style. He was polite, and attentive. Our orders came out just as we had ordered and we had a great time.   The hostess/host greeted us at the entrance and sat us promptly.   We will definitely be back.   -Britany"}
{"text":"This place is great! Great burger selection. (I got the morning burger with the sunny side egg and corn beef hash) Monday is burger happy hour so a burger with fries is $5!! (With purchase of a drink of course). Great beer selection. Will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the 3-Star average but we had a solid meal here with good service. I had the black bean burger and it was great and the fried zucchini's looked like stand up paddle boards!"}
{"text":"Alright...the table service we had was great but the bar service (our second time there) had an issue. The bartender, upon arrival, informed us he was \"under the weather\" then proceeded to wipe his runny nose with his forearm, and serve us waters. We had originally planned to have drinks and eat there but quickly changed our minds and went to Humble. If you're sick you don't belong at work especially if you're serving food...and you definitely should not tell every customer who walks in that you're ill."}
{"text":"Over priced and over cooked...service was fine but spending $30 on 2 burgers with wings is not something that anyone should do for so so food!"}
{"text":"Judy left this place about 45 minutes ago. So here's the real to grit review and WHY this is 2 stars only.   So to start off if you never have been there before.  *All the Burgers start off at $10 accept one I think.  *Don't even think about ordering a beer, seriously you would have to be insane. A 6oz BEER IS $4!!!!!!!!! SIX OUNCES!!!!!  The burgers they have are creative and very tasty. But for $10? Really... I can go somewhere else like Applebee's and do a 2 for $20 and get appetizer.  The employees are very nice, kind, and take care of what you need. No complaints there at all!  Next, on to the appetizers. Again...holy rip off from the 5th dimension. We got their home made chips. So, guess how much a bowl of chips are?? $5!!!!! YEA I SAID FIVE DOLLARS FOR CHIPS.   The burgers are good, but I would 10/10 times go somewhere else; for example, there's a chipotle and Qudoba within no joke 50 feet or so.   Main point is this. There is NOTHING at this place that is worth paying for. Beer is the worst prices IVE EVER SEEN. Burgers are good, TERRIBLE PRICES. Appetizers are good, THE WORST PRICES OF THEM ALL!!   Gets 2 stars for the flavor and that's about it."}
{"text":"Tell every person you know about how awesome this place is! The new owners are the most personable people I've ever met in a restaurant.  Make sure you come here every time you want a burger or a beer! You're doing yourself and all your friends a disservice if you don't!"}
{"text":"My boyfriends philly was gross. It tasted like the meat was spoiled. My grilled cheese burger was great though and so was every meal apart from his.  They were nice about it, thankfully, but I still find questionable meat quality problematic"}
{"text":"Food - the menu is impressive in terms of offering a variety of burgers and sandwiches.  Tried the breakfast burger, and it was solid.  Seriously, any burger with fried egg is redeemable, and the egg was cooked perfectly.  The burger was ordered medium, but came medium-rare.  My wife ordered a bacon cheeseburger, and wasn't that impressed.  Beer - decent selection, but for a place with \"Beer\" in the name, you'd think they'd have a slightly more extensive range of options, especially on draft.  Service - our waitress was attentive and very friendly.  Food came out at a nice pace form the kitchen.  I might be back for happy hour, but there are places closer to home that are just as good, if not better.  Might have to come back for the Luther, though..."}
{"text":"Prompt service during a lunch time visit, and the Breakfast Burger I ordered was pretty good."}
{"text":"We went with a large group and it was hit or miss. Some really loved what they got and some didn't. Everyone really loved their milkshakes tho."}
{"text":"I've been giving out a lot of 4 star reviews lately, so I am wondering what it is that keeps me from giving these places 5 stars. Am I incapable of being completely satisfied with an experience?   Am I afraid that if I give a place a perfect review, they will never again live up to it?   Perhaps I should talk this over with my shrink.  In any event, I will disclose that I seriously considered giving this place a 5 star review, but I suppose there's always room for improvement!  My fiance and I stopped here for a late lunch/early dinner last week and were very pleasantly surprised.  First of all, our server was excellent.  She gave us a big spiel about how everything there is fresh, hormone free, etc.  We then noted that on Monday nights after 5, all their burgers are 5.00.  Make a mental note of this and go here on a Monday-the burgers are already a great value, but for 5 bucks a piece they're a steal!  They have a ton of great selections on the menu, which we enjoyed.  We each had a tough time choosing which to get.  i eventually ended up choosing a burger that had tater tots and sloppy joe meat on it (the idea of it blew my mind-I just had to give it a whirl) My dining companion got the one with garlic sauce, Gouda, tomatos and onions.  We were both very happy with our burgers.  My gentleman friend was also pumped that I was only able to eat about a third of it, as he pretty much always eats my leftovers.  I was also tempted by the milkshakes, and pulled the trigger on a cookies and cream one.  They had some more unique flavors  of milkshake like cheesecake and cake batter which both sounded glorious.  Anyway, the shake was delicious.  If you are a B Spot loyalist and this place is near you, (or honestly, even if it's not) I would go.  The prices are better, and so are the burgers.  They also had a good beer selection.  The burgers also come with fries, cole slaw and a pickle.  Definitely a better value.   It's not the healthiest fare, funnily enough, we stopped here on our way to go buy a juicer so that we could eat healthier-haha, I guess that balances out the calories.  But if you are looking for a great burger and...well...a beer....this place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Very unique menu- excellent loadedtator tots- wide variety of beers, burgers, wings etc. tv screens everywhere. The place is decorated in a trendy way with steel and red. Generous portions and friendly staff."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to burgers and beer a few times and have always been extremely happy with our burger choices.  The meat was juicy and prepared as requested.  The toppings were equally delicious.  Both the onion rings and chili cheese nacho appetizers are great for sharing.  The hot mess burger is phenomenal and the black bean burger is truly delicious for the health conscious.  Great new addition to the Hillcrest area dining spots."}
{"text":"Really yummy burgers. The good the bad and the ugly was delicious! They have many other interesting burgers as well.  You can also fill a growler here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you go on a Monday for their $5 burgers. The Eiffel Toast Burger is amazing and you can't beat that price!"}
{"text":"I dig this place. Been here twice and both solid. Honestly best thing and it's worth taking home is the bbq sauce they leave on your table. First burger I had was some vampire burger w creamy garlic sauce and taste was great but also was cooked perfectly. Other burger was second from bottom of menu w Brie cheese. Same as first visit. Very solid. They also have coupons they mail you w buy 1 get 1 burger when u purchase 2 drinks. Very big area w lots of TVs. Parking can be a pain at times but give this place a try. I think I read a bad review where someone had bad fish. Bad fish at a place named Burgers 2 Beer?     That's like reviewing pasta at Red Lobster."}
{"text":"The food was very good and came out exactly as ordered, cooked perfectly to the temperature we each requested.   I actually only came on here to highlight the excellent service we received from Angela.  My wife and I were amazed at her service, friendliness, and professionalism."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with some friends, food was great, service was good, and it was not expensive. Not for those who count calories, but for a splurge, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The best corned beef sandwich I have ever had in my life!   This includes Corky & Lennys. It comes with a creamy rye dressing and thousand island dressing.  I ordered both on the side and ended up dipping my fries in the rye dressing. I will be salivating for this sandwich until i have it again.  My husband had the same and also loved it!  Everyone was all smiles tonight. Great experience again. We hope it stays that way."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but my office needed to have this delivered the third party delivery service was rude and over charged for items that should have come with the meal. I will try this place again to see if it's any good in person but I will certainly not use the delivery option again. It would have been best if they didn't offer it at all and we would have made time to pick it up instead."}
{"text":"If you're here for beers, this will be a great place with the amount of selections they have. However,  I try not to judge a restaurant by their beers since it's not like they brew their own, it's just how many beers they're willing to sell.  Now, let's get to their food. UHm... NO. Not a huge fan. i was so hyped up about this place and so were my coworkers. We got a huge crowd to come try this place out because.. Burgers 2 Beer... how does that not sound enticing?  I ordered their tots, wings, and shroom burger. Yes, No, and No. The tots were my best part of the night, with the meat topping on top of the tots. Delicious! It was a good start, but a bad ending. The wings weren't that flavorable and they weren't that tender. The skin of the wings were overly crispy. You'd be surprised, but too crispy made the chicken were hard to bite through and I thought the meat was overcooked. Then, the mushroom burger... well, it tasted liek a mushroom with a patty. Nothing special.   Maybe I'll be back here next time for beers, but definitely not a night when I'm looking forward to a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Nothing better than walking into a place with a please wait to be seated sign and no hostess. The barmaid was apparently to busy on her phone to notice us and btw there were only two other patrons in the whole place. After waiting at the hostess stand for about five minutes waiting for either a hostess to show or the barmaid to acknowledge us we decided to sit at the bar. The barmaid promptly gave us menues but just as quickly returned to her phone. Another five minutes and we attempted to wave her over to order, she asked us to hang on. I was ready to leave at this point and go to Melt across the street but my wife opted to stay and try the food.  The beer selection is at best ho hum. ( Think Apelbees or Fridays) . I asked for my burger to be cooked medium, it came out dry and gray in a word, horrible. The toppings did seem fresh. The French fries were a small portion, greasy to the max and remained untouched. My wife got a chicken sandwich that was obviously a frozen pre breaded cheap piece of chicken. We can say this with certainty because it was still frozen in the middle. The highlight was the upgrade to tater tots, we were able to eat those. Oh, and our server disappeared for a good twenty minutes. I got up and headed towards the kitchen to find someone to refill our drinks and was able to find a man I believe was the manager to refill our drinks. Terrible food, worse service. If you want to try this place do it quickly it won't be around long."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday afternoon. Service was good, even with the employee meeting going on a couple of tables over. Food was pretty good. Only negatives were they serve food in baskets. What happened to all of the plates in this town? The other, which I seem to find no matter where I go, is that no matter how you tell them to cook your burger, it will come out medium well. Mine was far from medium rare. We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Never coming back...that pretty much sums it up. The bartender doesn't know what he has on draft. The pretzels are clearly not fresh and served with what can only be compared to gas station cheese. Oh and our plate was dirty. Again, never coming back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, you can tell management cares about the place and how they do because to me it seems like they're continuously improving. I've been there three times. I was there today and they had a trivia day where I actually won a 20$ gift card from them to come back. I'm stoked because my fiancée loves their food anyways so we'd be back regardless. I love getting their mushroom burger which is called \"a real fungi\" I believe, can't remember but they've got some cool nick names for all their signature burgers. I saw a review about bad service but it must of been old because the 3 times I've come every time I've had excellent service, I wish I remembered the waitresses name because she was awesome, but all in all they did wonderful. I can also say the appetizers are huge, so you could literally get a couple appetizers and be close to having a full meal. It's kind of cool, especially happy hour when they're half off. I'm a general manager at a pizza shop, and we're doing good, so I'm quite knowledgeable in what's needed to run a good restaurant and this place has most of it if not all of it down."}
{"text":"I work for my City's Police Department and we placed a lunch order at the Cleveland Express location. Most of our burgers were incorrect, we were missing a few items, and our total was $10 too much. All I wanted to do was to make them aware that our order was incorrect, so that it could be prevented from happening to others, and to just see if I could get an explanation or clarification on the discrepancy in the prices. When I called and asked for the manager, I was told to call back in an hour because he had stepped out for awhile. When I called back 2 hrs later and asked for the manager, I could hear a male say in a very angry attitude, \"Get a name and number and tell them I will call them back or else we have nothing to talk about and this is coming from the owner.\" I would have been perfectly happy to leave my name and phone number, however the added comments and attitude was completely unnecessary. You have now lost a lot of City business and I will be telling anyone that will listen about this experience."}
{"text":"WHOMP WHOMP.  My bf got really excited about this place after hearing about their list of beers and of course, the burgers.  I don't know what people are talking about the place being dirty---but it was clean. Nothing stood out to me that was dirty.  First thing I ordered was the Cake Milkshake---that was really delicious. Dangerously delicious.  Burgers: The boyfriend got Oh Cheezit!--which was a burger sandwiched between 2 grilled cheese sandwiches. The burger patty--was average! Tasted like a normal 4th of July BBQ burger from the grocery store. Grilled cheese...average! I got the buffalo burger. Now--I honestly thought I was getting a buffalo-sauced burger. I imagine getting this burger dipped in buffalo sauce. But no! They killed an actual buffalo and made it into a burger. It sure tasted different and eh.  Service: what happened to our waitress? She went missing for quite sometime! Check please...::wait for another 30 mins::"}
{"text":"This place felt like a chain trying to be a dive bar. Overall the atmosphere is fun, lots of tvs, the menu is huge and all of the burgers sound amazing. They also have a nice draft selection. I got the burger of the month (with a black bean patty), which was a burger with a pierogi on it, with grilled onions and sour cream. First, it didn't come with any onions on it. There was barely any sour cream at all, I had to search for it as it was lightly smeared on the bun. The pierogi was quite obviously a Mrs.T's, which I'm fine with, but it seemed microwaved. I know you can fry those bad boys to perfection. Overall the food was pretty average, I expected better since they specialize in burgers. The burger and fries were both covered in a weird steak seasoning that I could have done without. The total for my friend and I was $35.00, for two burgers and two beers. Pretty expensive for what we got. Finally, the service was so awful. The server absolutely didn't want to be there. He never checked back, and we sat there waiting for silverware and napkins for about 10 minutes until he finally wandered by. At the end of the meal, he said \"could you guys pay the check? It's time for me to leave. \" WHAT?!?!?!?!? In my 8 years of serving, I have never once said that to a table. Guests were still walking in the door, so they for sure weren't close to closing. I know of other servers who have asked guests to pay, but I'm sure they said it a lot nicer. Couldn't believe that. I guess he doesn't realize how lucky he is to even have a job? Sorry for being so inconvenient, visiting your average restaurant and all. Won't be hurrying back here, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Walked in at 5:05 and was told we're closing to go next door to Jimmy Johns Or Rosco's???? Wtf!!!????"}
{"text":"I was really excited about taking my family here for lunch after reviewing the menu online.  I am currently writing this from the toilet of a gas station because my butt is literally throwing up the food I ate there an hour ago. The smell is enough to make the devil cry and I can never come to this gas station again after what I have done here.  Moving on.  The service was great if you like a server who appears to have 2 brain cells left both fighting for survival. We were a table of 5 saying grace before our appetizer and the server interrupted to take our order.   The burgers were just okay. Food took a long freakin time to come out. Beer was warm. Go somewhere else. This place comes across as a B Spot knock off that can't compete."}
{"text":"Everyone loved their burgers! Cooked to perfection. We skipped the beer menu ( a little too early in the day and I already want a nap). If you don't like salt and pepper on your fries be sure to tell them to hold it...they put on a lot!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I thought this was B&B Burger Joint, a personal favorite of mine.  When I got here, you can imagine the disappointment that overtook me LOL.  However, Burgers 2 Beer somewhat made up for it.  B2B is an order-over-the-counter restaurant, then they bring your food to your table.  I ordered the Duplex Salad, which is mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, and croutons, with a black bean burger on top and side of buttermilk ranch on the side.  Though everything tasted good, the portion was much smaller than I expected (I left hungry).  My friend made a better decision, and order the Oh Cheesus burger, a burger slapped in between two grilled cheese sandwiches.  He also got a side of fries.  He said the burger was \"pretty good\" which was somewhat disappointing considering a burger like that should be epic.  B2B is pretty cheap, has a good variety of burgers, and is relatively quick. Though I wouldn't go back to try a normal burger with so many other restaurants in the area, I might venture back one day to create a monster burger with their build your own burger option."}
{"text":"I'm sad to write this review as I really appreciate a good burger and beer joint. My husband picked this place out due to its proximity to Wolstein and the burger on a glazed donut bun that he thought would be fun for our son to try. After checking in, we were given a 20% off coupon on YELP, which would have helped a little with the disappointment, as I rate everywhere based on value for what they are. At full price, I'd never return here and not even sure that the discount would make a difference.   We were there on a Friday night during dinner/happy hour time. The front dining room was at about 1/3 capacity and the back bar about 2/3 of the seating was occupied. When we first entered, the place was full of grill smoke. I'm not sure if this is always the case, but something was definitely wrong with their ventilation system. This is the type of restaurant where you order at the counter and then they bring out your food to your table. There are several bottled and draft beers available at the counter with a full bar if you continue to walk further back into the restaurant. The hip chalkboard menu listed a huge selection of pre-fab burgers, sandwiches & salads and multiple sides and appetizers and then a build your own burger option. At first, I couldn't decide what to pick, everything sounded so good. The prices seemed a bit high which made me anticipate a really good burger. That just led to much disappointment. Also, there was a $3 charge to add fries to your sandwich. Typically the burgers were solo in a plastic basket...made me think they'd be huge.  The service was way less than welcoming or friendly with the bar staff in the back bar unhelpful and seemingly annoyed to have to wait on us. Everything I touched seemed sticky and dirty and the stools and table were wobbly. The bathroom was acceptable.  Sodas, ketchup, mustard and mayo along with plastic ware was self serve. They were out of multiple things we tried to order that were on their chalk board menus like ice cream, two different beers on their draft list, the Mountain Dew was empty as was the ketchup dispenser. No one at any time was apologetic for any of these things.   The burger patties themselves were machine formed if not food service frozen. The meat was under seasoned and WAY over cooked to a dried up charred tasting patty. I wish I would have removed the patty from the bun because I would have enjoyed the rest of the sandwich. The brioche bun was fresh tasting as were the toppings of lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle. The fresh cut fries were pretty good as was the sloppy Joe meat on the loaded tots. The cheese sauce on the tots was waxy & flavorless. The tots themselves were food service quality and tasted fine. The burger on the donut was tasty, too bad that burger was over cooked, but it was small and hardly had any bacon on it. The burger on French toast with bacon and egg was bland and only saved by the syrup served wth it. That patty was also crispy charred and dry.   With all the great food options in Cleveland, I really wouldn't bother with this one. I'm sure it is convenient though for the college kids at CSU. Our three small burgers with a side of loaded tots, a side of fries and one fountain drink came to $43. We bought two beers at the bar in the back."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place another try last night. For starters, why put an appetizer on the menu for $3 and only give us 5 pieces? Then charge us for the dipping sauce? Ridiculous! The Hawaiian hot was good, but it was lacking something. We also got the Vampire burger, I didn't have any of it, but, my boyfriend seemed to like it. Your fries are always good. BUT, the service was terrible. I don't know why your wait staff is so miserable!"}
{"text":"The menu is so creative!  We split the club and fungus burgers and loved them even though we ordered takeout.  The burgers were cooked just how I like them and seasonings were perfect. I could tell that the fries would be good fresh since they were delicious though a little soggy.  My husband ate the cheese-us burger and he felt it was a little dry and could use onions and mushrooms next time.  I need to come back for a dine-in meal for a true evaluation."}
{"text":"I love this place, no matter when I go I am not disappointed. As a vegetarian, sometimes it is hard for me to find good options, especially at meat-centric places. However, Burgers 2 Beer has great options for vegetarians.   I never go wrong with the Frijoles Negro (black bean burger) every component on the burger is great, it melts in my mouth! They also have really great salads too! My favorite is the Nature's bounty, the house made champagne vinaigrette is amazing too! There are also vegetarian wraps and quesadillas as well!   My carnivore fiancé loves this place too. He is especially enamored with one of their newer burgers, the Eiffel Toast. There really is no bad burger on the menu. For less adventurous folks, the Good, Bad and Ugly is a great bet! The home made honey peppered bacon really adds some great flavor to the burger.   This place has such a great selection of apps too. The menu has undergone some updating recently, and they have some great additions. I can't wait to go back soon and try some more!"}
{"text":"Took the wife and kids here on a Friday night around 7pm.  There was a :30 minute wait but that is to be expected for that time of day on a Friday. There was a really good beer selection but the server wasn't able to offer much insight into any of the offerings - One would think that a server at a restaurant that specializes in beers and burgers would have knowledge of the two.  One would be wrong. Luckily I found a few that I had interest in.  The service otherwise was pretty good. I ordered the 'Oh Cheezus' burger. It's the one with the two grilled cheese sandwiches used as buns.  The cheese inside was barely melted and the bread was barely grilled however the burger patty was prepared as directed.  It wasn't the best burger I've had but certainly not the worst.  We'll definitly give it another go"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try one of the interesting burgers on the menu, but decided on chips as a started. They were OK - however they were not served with the dipping sauce and despite having asked the waitress, she never came back with it. But whatever, people can live without dipping sauces. Chips are good no matter what.   The burger though, was even more of a disappointment. Ordered the Breakfast burger with corned beef hash, a fried egg, and hollandaise sauce. The corned beef hash was about the size of a quarter, no more, and cold. The egg was hard as a brick and crispy on the bottom. The hollandaise was not fresh at all. I'm not a complainer so I did not say anything. I pushed the cold corned beef and hard egg off the burger and ate it that way. It was pretty good minus the toppings that I had initially really wanted. The fries were pretty good too.   I just expected better, for a menu that boasts such crazy topics, you'd think they'd be, you know, edible."}
{"text":"Lots of seating indoor and out. Cool music. Sports TV. Really cool servers.   This is my fourth time here. The first time I ordered a beat up burger. The second time I ordered a beat up burger. That's right. It was that good!   Third time was a wrap which was also really good. I'm having another wrap today.   The people here are really kind and attentive. It seems this business is here to stay."}
{"text":"I went with my buddy tom . once a month we go find some new exotic (to us).  Well this establishment came from a friend, so naturally we had to go check it out.  Steve: Well my order was pretty plain and simple, i got your basic cheeseburger and frys. the burger was perfect, it tasted divine.it had the right amount of french frys. all meals include pickle and coleslaw. me personally, i loathe all mayo based foods. My experience was extremely pleasant. we sat at the bar, the bar tender was really nice and refilled my diet soda. atmosphere is important to me, good small place, tvs all over the place and they played really good music, a nice blend of classic rock.  i will return  Tom: i had the Parmesan wings, and i poured hot sauce on them, they were amazing. i do like mayo based food and the coleslaw was good. I got  the Good The Bad The Ugly, and it was a delicious bbq style burger.  Prices were  fair and would be a frequent bar experience for my self if i didint live so far away"}
{"text":"Horrible service at the bar.... wait I didn't even get that. Sat there for 10 minutes watching two bartenders chatting away while I sat patiently finally getting up and just going to fox & hound in Mayfield 11 miles away. Thought I'd try some place new while traveling in town and so much for that."}
{"text":"Better than the B-spot!  First off, you don't have to pay extra for frenchfries, which by all rights is the ever-faithful and loyal sidekick to the hamburger.  The burgers are hand made and dont look like a tiny, preformed, cookic-cutter patty.  The brews on tap are decent and the food is great (especially the sloppy tots).  My only problem is its location.  Burgrers 2 Beers deserves better than a strip mall right off the interstate."}
{"text":"Visited in a very busy but mid-sized Saturday night.t was just okay. Dishes and silverware had just come out of the dishwasher and were spotted. We had to clean them off with napkins. The burgers we ordered were good as were the fried zucchini appetizer. It's just a shame that the management did nothing to help out friendly but over worked server. Can think of other places in town with good burgers and much better sanitation and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The burgers here are ok. The fries are very good. The people that work here are they problem. They are very unprofessional. One guy was on the phone talking how he was cheating on his girlfriend while taking orders. The other worker was talking about his prior. This place would be a lot better if the workers would have some class."}
{"text":"The service here is great. We had a good time and the food was cooked just right. We will likely be going here more."}
{"text":"I am a student at Cleveland state and have been visiting this location for months. I will no longer go after last night. The new blonde bartender is rude and unprofessional. Last night she yelled at me to pay for my beers before I even had a chance to hand the drinks over to my friend. Great food but horrible customer service."}
{"text":"We decided to give it another try- twice since this review- it's been perfect each time- hence the change in rating. Food was great and service awesome!    We tried to go eat there now- but 45 minutes before closing with people in there eating- the doors are locked and we couldn't get in. I want to like Burgers 2 Beer- I want to support any establishment with grass fed beef (per the website), but if you have posted hours, follow your posted hours. That is a form of bad service- we wasted gas and time to go to this establishment and we're sorely disappointed. Will NOT be doing this again at this location."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I am seeing a lot of more negative reviews, but I was pleasantly impressed with this place. The atmosphere is pretty cool. They have a great beer selection and the menu is written on a chalk board (pretty neat!).  My wife and I ordered some wings as an app. They were really good. Nice size and crispy. For our entree, I went out on a limb and tried the \"Luther\" burger. It's a 1/2 lb burger with cheddar and bacon with a glazed donut as a bun :) The burger itself was really tasty (the donut made it unique :). My wife ordered a garlic burger with gouda cheese and bacon. She liked it too.   Along with the burger, of course, they serve fresh cut fries which were out of this world! I'll definitely be back to try the Nut Butter (a burger with peanut butter ;)"}
{"text":"Yay! I get to do a decent review for once. So the other day I went to B2B and it was actually pretty good. I got \"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\" burger and it was really good. It was basically a BBQ, bacon cheese burger and the burger had a nice grilled taste. The bun was super soft but sturdy and fries were really really good even after I let them sit for a while they still had a crispness to them. I ordered a thirsty dog beer in raspberry that was also pretty good and a large glass of blue moon which was bigger then I expected.  The service was okay, our waitress was busy so I understand not getting the attention but it took a long time to get the food over to my friend and I, as well as the A.C. was on full blast. Cool place, a little on the dark side as far as lighting but enjoyable.    ***  I have changed my pervious rating of 3 stars to 5 stars because of Elie C. Of Burgers 2 Beers and his interest in my review and customer satisfaction. This is my response to his comment below. This is the perfect example of why I take time out of my life to write these reviews. Not just to vent and be brutally honest. I want change and I want to enjoy going out and having a good meal with family, friends and coworkers. We all spend time getting dress and getting ready to have an experience of a life time and eat good food that we rather not cook ourselves and it such a disappointment when that same excitement is not met with the same enthusiasm when it comes to customer service and the quality of the food.  As you should know my reviews are very blunt and honest. I do not hesitate to tell the truth where the light needs to be shed, therefore I have yet to have an establishment contact me on Yelp to ask me how they can BETTER their establishment and for that I applaud you.   The additional star would have come from the customer service. I know that it was busy that night but had the waitress spent the extra effort to swing by to tell us that food was on the way or to ask how we were doing, that five second effort could have given the Burgers 2 Beers the 5 stars that I'm sure it deserves but I did not receive that addition customer service that sets you apart from all the other restaurants. Customer service is the most important asset to keeping your customers happy along with great food. With that said, Burgers 2 Beers is a wonderful restaurant to dine in with friends and family and I am reevaluating my review and giving you 5 stars today for your interest in taking my review seriously and improving customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"I have to write this now. My belly is full of burger and beer and holy cow was this place yummy. Between four adults and three kids, not a plate was left with a crumb or a bite to spare.  We walked in on a 3:00pm on a Sunday and it was empty, but the crowd slowly came in shortly after we arrived, which made me feel better about our decision to stop.  I got the Frijoles Negro and it was out of this world. I swapped my bun for a pretzel and the size of the burger was not small. My husband got The Breakfast and swapped his bun out for a doughnut, yes a doughnut. He is still talking about it. Then there was the turkey burger, ordered by a friend, and it was out of this world. Word is, the breakfast sandwich with the french toast is a must, too!  Lots of beer options and special, especially on the beer front.  B2B is nearly 40 minutes from Wadsworth, our home, but we've already agreed that we would find a way to make it back. Three cheers all around.  Bonus: when I checked in via Yelp! I got 20% off coupon!"}
{"text":"Ordered the breakfast burger and tater tots (a nice option). Burger was cooked to order and the bacon was extra tasty. Corned beef hash and fried egg top it off. Egg roll is a nice touch over a cheap bun.   Good food. Great service. Bartender was particularly friendly and attentive. Big selection of various burgers. There are other selections on the menu as well, but I came in intent on having a burger. A large selection of draft beers is always nice. I counted 24 tap handles from my seat, including Guinness!   Only thing I could complain about is the music. Light old rock is just not my fave. But that's minor.  Worth a visit for sure!"}
{"text":"here I sit eating a cold boxed up burger at my house with no beer, writing a review. When we arrived we asked to be seated away from the noise of the big game because I'm not into sports and I wanted to be away from people. They didn't even bother to turn the lights back up where we were sitting but whatever,  ambiance. We ordered burgers and wings and asked for our wings first. Then we never saw our server again. Twenty minuets later another employee brought out burgers and I told him that we had ordered wings and didn't get them I was annoyed and hungry but mistakes happen. The guy just stood there looking befuddled and offered no apology. So I told him we just wanted our burgers He set them down and walked away.  So there I was sitting there with no beer, no water,  a burger and no apology expecting our server to pop out and apologize for the mistake ask us if we needed anything and that the cook was preparing us FRESH wings . That didn't happen , instead, two minutes pass and the guy brings us wings ( which looked like they'd been sitting there for fifteen minuets) ....I told him we didn't want them any more and again  he just walked away ....no I'm sorry, no can I get you anything else,  nothing !  I had enough I left the table found my server ( it wasn't really that busy mind you there was a crowd but lots of empty tables and most everyone was at the bar ). She was in the back looking ... Confused? Bored?  I asked for water \"please\" and she got it for me \"here you go\"  Again no apology and why wasn't she at our table asking us if we needed anything for our meal.... The manager comped our food but we didn't get half of it anyhow  ( we still had to pay for drinks of course ) I just asked for boxes and we left. It wasn't the mistake that did me in it was the fact that our server ignored us even after the mistake had been made ."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Great burgers! We had a large crowd and they did a great job! love the patio for private parties!"}
{"text":"We went in late on a Saturday night & asked if they were still serving food.  They said yes & sat us.  There were very few tables of customers.  After 15 min of no one coming to take our order, we left.  The second star is because I do like their burgers."}
{"text":"Great variety of burgers. Good selection of draft beers as well. Quick seating. Many TVs for sporting events.   I had the Good Bad and the Ugly burger. It was excellent. One suggestion I would make is to order the burger a little more done than you usually do. They tend to under cook   Great place. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great apps! Excellent burgers and our server was AMAZING! I've been to their other location and didn't like it half as much as the Solon location."}
{"text":"The hamburgers are as big as wendys' burgers, i ordered the teriyaki medium and it was well done, service was a little slow there was inly one girl working behind the bar.  She was nice but, slow burgers are nothing special.  Only Good thing is that they come with fries, which they were crispy and flavorful. I dont think im coming back"}
{"text":"My husband & I stopped in here a couple of weeks ago. I have been here several times without him. Today was no exception in the food or service, both were spot on perfect, as usual. Each & every time I've been here my burger is always cooked exactly to order, it's fresh, dressed by someone who cares, and full of immense flavors.  I usually order the Beat Up or the Like Butta Baby. My hubs ordered the Vampire Hunter, his was perfection as well.  Do yourself a favor & check this establishment out, you won't be disappointed & ask for Chloe, she's a fabulous server!!"}
{"text":"First visit to Burgers 2 Beer was ok.  Burger fine, fries, ok, etc. etc.    I am over burgers, bacon, tacos and bbq.  Too many spots doing the same thing and it is just not interesting to me.  Our friends in Lakewood suggested that we join them at Burgers 2 Beer on a recent Friday night. Here we go again, I thought, another mediocre dining experience.  But we like their company and we agreed to meet there for dinner.     Glanced at the menu, put it down, and succumbed to the idea I wouldn't find something interesting to eat.  I had just suggested splitting a chicken sandwich with my wife when a waiter passed carrying a plate with a large hot dog and fries. After I saw three diners take a bite or two, I politely interrupted.  Excuse me; what do they call that hot dog on the menu?  The Municipal, the friendly diner answered.  Is it worth it, you know, I mean the calories, I asked.  Absolutely, she said.    Yum!  I'd give the municipal (100% Angus beef, with chopped onions, pickle relish and Bertram's mustard on a lightly toasted bun) a 5 star rating, but this was my second visit and I didn't expect that I would be back but was happy we did.  So 4 stars will have to do!  Go, enjoy the Municipal and a few cold drafts and I am sure you will want as much as I do!"}
{"text":"This location is pretty good.  Service is warm and friendly and there are a plethora of burger choices, chicken sandwich choices and anything you could slap on a bun too.  They also have a ton of different starters and a wide variety of beer selections.  If you don't drink, they have old fashioned root beer and milkshakes as well.  Not too pricey and a great casual local chain."}
{"text":"I really missed Eddie and Eddie's. Turns out, Burgers 2 Beer is even better--a major upgrade, really. I got a bacon cheeseburger, which is pedestrian for a gourmet burger place, but I like to start with a staple to get a feel for the quality. My girlfriend got the \"Not Mama's Meatloaf\" burger. Seems minor, but the buns were really good. Far too often you'll get a subpar bun that doesn't soak up the burger. These were really good at keeping everything contained, even the meatloaf burger which had mashed potatoes on it!  I look forward to coming back; they have a big, bold menu with lots to try. 5 stars, baby!"}
{"text":"First time here with a friend and it was very good. It was a Sunday night and we ordered the Cajun Crab Dip as an appetizer and split the Good, Bad, and Ugly Burger. Both we very good. The service was good as well. It was later in the evening and the bartender was busy getting organized to close, but I would have exected a little more friendliness. Overall a very good experience. Would return and recommend."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review because there are two people workin, and I'm still waiting for my food. 50 patrons and 2 employees means long wait times and poor management."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check out Burgers 2 Beer for awhile now and finally had the opportunity this past weekend. I came here on Saturday night to watch the final four game with some friends. We ordered dinner and had some drinks.   The set up is really great and they have really great potential but the service is lacking. The food menu is huge which is a plus but is also why my order got messed up. I ordered the golden chicken wrap and then got the buffalo chicken wrap. I knew it was wrong because my cousin and I ordered the same thing and her's looked different and was not spicy like mine.  Since they did bring me the wrong food I think I should have gotten my meal comped. Instead they didn't charge me for my 1st beer. I can see why the reviews are so mixed about this place. I'm not giving up on this place though. It's a great environment for watching sports and grabbing a brew with friends!"}
{"text":"So...a vegetarian walks into a burger joint on opening night...    Burgers 2 Beer is housed in what was once Naya and has been retooled to be an upscale burgers and beer joint.  Gone are the mojitos and hummus from the days of old.  The menu is now jam packed with gluttonous things like tater tots slathered in cheese, onion rings, and burgers sandwiched in between donuts or grilled cheese sandwiches.  I'm not a beer drinker, but there's a wall full of craft beer to wash it all down with, too.  I don't eat veggie burgers, but there is a black bean burger option available for the vegetarians.  There are also a couple meat free salads.  And I'm guessing that on a slightly less chaotic night, it would be possible to get one of the sandwiches or burgers containing meat to be modified to suit a person with special dietary needs.    Considering that I went during the grand opening, there were only a few minor hiccups.  No silverware.  Waitress who was confused about the specials.  (I'd double check if you order what you think is a $1 beer - people at my table wouldn't have had so many drinks if they'd known they were actually $5!)  And although there's a full bar, no one knows how to make a mojito....but...I'll cut them some slack.  (perhaps have a drink menu for patrons so we don't confuse the bartender?)    The salad I had was good.  My mom had the black bean veggie burger and was happy to see that it was homemade and not fresh from the freezer.  The other two people at my table had burgers and beers and were pretty pleased with their meals.  The only really awkward part of our meal was having to pay at the door - Denny's style.  It was pretty packed, and I could see how someone could easily duck out without paying.  I always feel weird tipping when I have to pay a cashier and not my server, too, but maybe that's just me.  Hope that this revamped restaurant has nothing but success!"}
{"text":"Food is great,Staff is very friendly but it can be packed during a game or Monday 5$ Burger Nights.  Monday is 5$ burger night so expect it to be completely packed and can take awhile for food to come out. Food is the best and their unique menu ideas keep the crowds coming. Not sure if they have changed their menu for April burger of the month. If not...order the peep burger...best thing I've ever had"}
{"text":"I went here for the second time for burger night. The service was ridiculously slow which made no sense because the number of people working there was almost equal to the number of patrons. They are very friendly but flagging them down can be a hassle.   I didn't realize to get the burger deal you also had to order a drink so I had to spend $3 on a lemonade I didn't want which was annoying. Last time I got a beer so on the plus if you're feeling a literal burgers 2 beer night those do count as your beverage!   My biggest complaint is the burgers are remarkably over done. Last time my friend and I ordered \"medium\" and it was brown all the way through. This time I did \"medium rare\" and there was barely any pink and my companions \"medium\" was completely brown again. The first time we chocked it up to an accident but twice is too many times.   The $3 appetizers are kinda a steal but not. They reduce the portions and don't include sauces so you'd probably be better off getting one regular appetizer than a bunch of little ones. I would be less annoyed if they included sauces.   The fries are super tasty and topped with garlic salt and their bbq is great (but mostly HFCS). So there's the positives. I hate leaving negative feedback to local businesses but my experiences have ranged from subpar to mediocre"}
{"text":"Great food decent customer service horrible parking even got a ticket once. The owner on wine night closed the restaurant 40 minutes early which to Add insult to injury after searching for a parking space for 15 minutes. If you have the patience for a quick lunch I'd recommend"}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Crowded maybe half the time I dined there (esp. on a Saturday evening!). Yet, I was always seated pretty quickly.  Each time, I ordered the Luther because apparently, a heart attack at an early age seems appealing (not). You see, the Luther is a donut bacon cheeseburger. It. Is. YUMMY!  My only complaint is, they take a skinny glazed donut and cut it in half. So you're sitting there with flimsy pieces of a donut that basically fall apart half way through the meal. You're left with massive amounts of meat and cheese. No bueno. Me no likey.  The issue is, I don't want to look like a beached whale and whisper, \"Hey, um... so can I have TWO DONUTS instead of you cutting a shady glazed donut in half?? Is that extra or...?\" I have issues with people mentally judging me, so I suffer in silence. *cries*  The fries are nothing to write home about.   We also ordered starters (sloppy tots & Chili Cheese Nachos). Eh. Meh.   My husband had some beer and he enjoyed them. He also always ordered the Good, Bad and the Ugly and liked it.  I'll be back when I work up the nerve to order two glazed donuts. Or at least make my husband order it for me so that he looks like the fat bastard."}
{"text":"The burgers are good, but the wings need some help. My husband ordered the Thai sauce boneless wings. Supposedly at the top of the \"hot\" spicy scale. They were barely spicy, and the Thai sauce we asked for on the side tasted like Franks hot sauce with 1/2 the heat. I think a spicy peanut sauce is more like what we expected and would be delicious on the wings.  B2B, you are missing the boat on this one. Thai wings were nothing Thai at all. Very disappointing.  Also, the champagne vinaigrette salad dressing is bland. It needs a little sweetening to be a true champagne vinaigrette. The color is perfect, but the taste is very vinegar-y.  We'll be back for more burgers. They are very good."}
{"text":"My Husband has been raving about this place since he first went a couple of years ago. We had been meaning to go together, and I'm glad we finally did. I had the most phenomenal cheeseburger of my life from here. I ordered a Simple Susan but it was cooked so perfectly.    I was so overwhelmed (in a good way!) by the menu; everything sounded so unique! The fries on the side were perfectly seasoned, which is always a plus. They had a fun beer list to choose from too. Service was fast and friendly. I'm looking forward to coming back here soon."}
{"text":"Its all in the name. These are the best burgers around and the come out exactly how you order them. The appetizers are good. They did change the macaroni bites from the typical triangle ones to these little nuggets and they are not quite as good as they used to be. They have a great selection of beers and service is always good."}
{"text":"The good: A fresh, crisp dill pickle - none of those floppy yellow things no one wants.  The cream soda float was pretty fantastic, I drained that in minutes.  The fries are just right, flavorful and just the right amount of crisp.  Then there's the Oh Cheesus burger, a burger inside two grilled cheeses.  It was reasonably tasty.  And it led to suuuuuuch regret.  Moaning, gasping regret.  I checked in with my concerned companion, and she said that she, too, was having some trouble on that level (she also had a burger).  I'm not sure how to rate this - I'm unwilling to give it 1 star, despite how it essentially ended my evening.  The ambience was good and the flavors were good, too, so, I'd have given it 3-4 stars if it weren't for the crampy evil that followed.  I'm a little bummed, I haven't tried the Luther, but I'm a'feered to give it another go."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Comfort Inn and it was a short walk away.  I ordered Mac and cheese bites, burger and boneless wings.  Everything was meh: not good.  Boneless Wings were overly breaded, Mac and cheese bites were greasy and burger had lots of wilted lettuce."}
{"text":"It's nice to finally have a new restaurant in Willowick. It's different and seems to always be pretty busy. The food is good and there are so many things to choose from. My only complaint is that it took a bit to get my order and my waiter seemed to have too much on his plate to pay just enough attention. I've heard from other people that they had good service so it might have just been an off day!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, way better than B-spot. Try the sloppy tots, they taste just like a sloppy Joe with cheese. I had the Luther burger. Burger with American cheese, bacon on a glazed donut. Sounds weird but awesome!! They give you a nice size burger, great fries and coleslaw for $8.99. They have such a good selection of unique burgers and beers."}
{"text":"First visit here! I ordered the Good.bad ugly burger and it was cooked perfectly!The atmosphere was cool and the service was helpful and friendly! Half of the resturant was closed, probably because we went for lunch! Im already planning what I'lll have next visit!!"}
{"text":"The burger list is extensive and creative, as is the beer selection. Pretty standard bar fare otherwise, but it hits the spot. Plenty of TVs without feeling like a sports bar. Not a bad place, and significant bonus points for the bowling machine and pool table."}
{"text":"first time here .. food was excellent .. pretzels & beer cheese dip as an appetizer? .. YES PLEASE! .. we are burger purists so we did not have our eyes on the specialty burgers listed but did enjoy reading the descriptions .. we also saw some other sandwiches and appetizers we would like to return to try .. we both got standard issue cheeseburgers but they were cooked perfectly & quite tasty .. had the chocolate mousse turtle dessert & that was delish as well .. only minor disappointment was the side of mac + cheese we opted for w/1 of our burgers .. somewhat tasteless but improved when we added salt & a bit of the beer cheese dip to it"}
{"text":"Fun menu.  Great service.  Good selection of beer.  Close to good hotels.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Wings are the best around these parts. And the loaded fries have the other restaurants beat!"}
{"text":"Not the best burger place in town.  First off, the burgers are very expensive.  My bill came to be more than $10. I don't mind paying more for a burger if it is really good.  Burgers 2 Beer does have an interesting selection of toppings - I ordered the \"Clubbed\" burger, which has ham, turkey, spinach, and a tomato.  My burger was okay, but I've definitely had better burgers for half the price. The meat could have been seasoned better.  The fries could have definitely been better.  Many were overcooked or burned.     Service could definitely be improved - I ordered my burger at the same time as 2 of my friends and got to eat it 15 minutes after they got theirs.  In a restaurant where you order a range of different items, this may be understandable. For something like burgers which should be made all at the same time on the grill, this doesn't make sense.  Overall you can have better burgers for your money at other places."}
{"text":"Really not impressive. Service was so-so. Really didn't like the food it was plain  flavorless and they charge for every little thing even mayo. I won't return."}
{"text":"Best burger bar around. I always order the blue cheese with bacon and sweet potato fries. Never disappointed. Not gourmet but tasty great value. Good TV coverage from every seat."}
{"text":"I took my staff for lunch here.  The service was great, the menu selection was good too.  I ordered the black bean burger it was a bit on the small side but all other dishes were of a good portion."}
{"text":"Needs to work in customer service. The food and beer choices are great, but I should not have to work to get noticed by the bar tender to order when there are only 2 others at the bar.  In other words, I understand there are regulars, but do not allow them to consume all your time where the new person at the bar is ignored."}
{"text":"We were the first customers of the day and our waitress was extremely friendly and courteous.  We started off with fried pickles, which were to die for....  We also ordered the onion rings which were also tasty morsels.  The burgers are equally as good and will be back again."}
{"text":"Well, as you might have guessed, burgers are the go-to menu item here. They have other typical American restaurant abar food options but I stick with their staple food. A sucker for a good pun, I love seeing that most of the menu is made up of foods titled with clever names.  Probably the most redeeming characteristic is their humor and variety of burger offerings.   I decided to test the limits of my arteries with the \"Oh Cheesus,\" a burger made up with grilled cheese sandwiches in place of the top and bottom buns. Overall, very delicious, but the salt between the sandwich and fries was very noticeable. Prepare for a sodium spike.  Each time I've been here I've asked for a medium burger and found that they overcooked the meat compared to what I'm used to at other restaurants. It's been a while since my last visit so I forgot to ask for a temperature down.   A waiter indicated this place doesn't get too busy on weekdays outside of the dinner hours. When we showed up with about 15 people at 9pm, they seemed almost annoyed. Not a lot of options to maneuver tables together for large groups so we broke up into two groups.   I'm glad Burgers 2 Beers finally got their website and signage in sync. Last time I visited, the website was advertising $5 burgers on Mondays and the restaurant said $5.99. This trip in, the waiter wasn't aware of what the daily special was for a Thursday. I looked it up online before I asked to test they were the same. Since he didn't know, I had to get up and walk outside to look on their window signage to confirm. Couldn't find their daily specials listed anywhere else on the menu or table flyers. Even after all that, the bills came back with incorrect pricing so we had to get all of the checks redone. A slight hassle, but the servers were polite as they sorted it out."}
{"text":"That first bite is so delicious! We got takeout, so it wasn't fresh off the grill when we got home, but still great. Fries, too."}
{"text":"This is me and my girlfriend spot on Monday's  $5 burgers with the purchase of a beverage after 5 p.m. to close I usually get the $5 pitcher. The burgers are delicious and they have a nice variety of different but tasty burgers, my favorite is the Eiffle toast which consists of french toast as the bun,cheese,bacon,fried egg,burger and a side of maple syrup. Oh you get fries with that too! I fail to mention that I go to the highland hts location staff is very friendly. I suggest getting there at 5p.m. because it gets very busy. One more thing pretty much all the food me and my girlfriend ate was good!"}
{"text":"Neat location, a bar w/ a wide beer and burger selection.  Had the pizza burger, prepared as asked for and tasty.  Recommended."}
{"text":"This place could easily rival B-Spot. The burgers are not quite there yet but they definitely take the cake for value. For $10 you get a MASSIVE burger, fries, homemade cole slaw and a pickle. The beer list was pretty extensive and very affordable.I ordered the Hot Mess which was GREAT (and VERY filling) but feel like I have to go back because there are so many other burgers that I wanted to try."}
{"text":"First time here. Good burgers. I don't think they have the traffic to have as many beers on tap.  I got three different IPAs and all were flat.  I drink a lot of IPA.  I am not sure what the other beers were like.  So take caution when ordering your drinks"}
{"text":"One of the best burger places in Cleveland.  Great and creative menu.  My favorite is The Fungi, always done to perfection.  Beer selection is adequate.  Michael Simon needs to include B2B on the \"best I ever had\" show :)"}
{"text":"First time wont be the last time.  Went for lunch and got the hot mess burger.. so good.. fries are amazing too.  I could go back tonight for dinner.  Great beer selection and would be a good spot to watch sports over the typical lakewood bars"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night. Place was dead. Was our first time there. Sat at the bar had good service. Had pickle fries those were good. Burger was OK. Cool place would try again"}
{"text":"Went here for a happy hour and it was a good local choice if you are looking for something convenient to Solon area and aren't looking to spend too much $$.  The appetizer portions were lower priced but definitely smaller.  Drink menu was actually decently diverse beyond beer.  Ordered dinner as well, while bummed that they didn't have veggie burger substitution option, I enjoyed the veggie quesadilla."}
{"text":"I've been to Burgers 2 Beer quite a few times. The main motivation has always been that it never seems to be crowded. So a quick table and service should seem reasonable. However, this is not usually the case. Granted I've only really come here with bigger groups of people. I understand if a place has limited staff to support a huge crowd, but it always seems like there is more than enough staff and that they are simply confused on how to handle a group. I've also found the service to be particularly slow.      They do have great specials every day of the week, but make sure to check them out before you head in. Whenever I've asked a waiter about specials, they seem to have no idea. I always check the sign on the front window to be sure as their website seems to even be off.       Although getting in and seated seems to always be an issue, I have no complaints about the food. They have great wings and fries, but charge you an extra $2 if you want to sub out tots or others, which I find disappointing. I've also tried to buffalo chicken wrap and Reuben, which were delicious.       With a name like \"Burgers 2 Beer\" I would generally want to try a burger, but I have not heard the best reviews of them, so I have stuck with some of the other menu items.       I'm hoping this place can sort out some of their hosting and serving issues because I think it has great potential. I would love to see it last. I would definitely recommend checking this place out, just make sure to do your homework first!"}
{"text":"Positives:  - Burgers are delicious. Good quality beef, and plenty of options, and they really do cook to order.  - Wings are decent sized and the sauces are really good.  - Servers are very friendly.  Negatives:  - You can get nickel and dimed a bit if you choose to customize. If you get a pre designed burger it's a good deal, if you customize your own, it's gets pricey. Same with ranch/bleu cheese for dipping wings.  - Does take quite some time to get the food. Don't expect fast. This isn't as negative though because the food always comes out hot and fresh, so it's worth the wait.  Overall- 4 stars."}
{"text":"Let's start with...oh hell yeah the food kicks ass! Came to Cleveland to see Nitro Circus Live..which ROCKED! I'll yelp about that later, but this little place threw us a curve. It's a narrow restaurant with a bar in the back, open kitchen so you can see the action. The menu was interesting and made your mouth water. We hade two meals...Applewood smoked bacon cheese burger with onion rings and a \"Fit Chick\" which was a quesadilla with grilled chicken, goat cheese, artichoke hearts, and mushrooms. One of the best burgers I ever had and my wife killed the quesadilla. Fantastic food...I would give them a 5 on the food, but they were way understaffed for the volume and we waited 30 minutes...I saw our food made...it took 5 minutes for someone to snag it and bring it...that made the onion rings warm/cold...everything was still delicious, but at least one waitress in the front of the house would help a lot. The bar had 2 waitresses. But the dude working the registrar, taking orders, he hustled...but he was being pulled from every arm. This place rocks, just have patience for the food....it we'll worth it."}
{"text":"So I actually read the reviews for B2B while at the restaurant and had a hard time understanding a few of them.  Now let me break down the highs and lows here.  Food:  Good.  Not the best burgers but kudos for being brave and making up burgs that no body has tried before, at least to my knowledge.  The burger didn't have that juicy, drippy, cholesterol stricken feel that I like in my hamburger, but it was seasoned nicely and cooked to order.  I think if they changed the cooking method or upped the fat/meat ratio, the burgers would improve.  I tried the fungi and the wife got the Oh Cheesus!   I would recommend both.  Now on an entirely different note, you have to get the cheesy tots.  I went with the sloppy Joe on the side which seemed like the way to go.  Apparently I have a new addiction to cheesy tots at B2B because both the wife and I plan on hitting just the bar area and ordering some next week.  YUMM!!  Fries are fresh cut, fried, and decent.  Not much seasoning so be prepared to salt and pepper to your own taste.  I skipped the fries and ordered a side of mac and cheese.  It's OK, not the best I've had but definitely something you can snack on and give the rest to the kid.  Coleslaw and pickle that comes with each meal are standard.  Did I mention the tater tots???  Service:  Seems like this took the biggest hit with reviews.   Fortunately, I did know one of the servers, Heather, and we were WELL taken care of.  I did hear that there has been some server shuffling because of customer complaints, lets hope that's been done.  Beer:  Holy beer list for a tiny place.  We went for the $5 Dundee Holiday Beer which we really enjoyed, both price and flavor.  Great start to my Saturday.  I suggest if you have a question about something on the beer list, ask to talk to the bartender or GM, its as easy as that.  Keep in mind that there are other things on the menu besides burgers.  Some of the chicken sandwiches sounded delicious which warrants another visit by me.  However, until the burgers improve (being a burger joint), I'll probably keep this at 3 stars."}
{"text":"Not the best food.  Very 1980's bar food. My taco salad has mini fried tacos in it.... weird and not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"We went here for something different last weekend, can't say I was too impressed. The atmosphere is cool and trendy and seems to really make the place feel like it has a lot going for it. Beer selection is large but a lot of the same, I stuck to old faithful blue moon and he tried the ipa's throughout the menu. They didn't have a great selection of drafts so I was afraid to get stuck with a bottle that I didn't car for. Prices were just right on the beers and they have a great pitcher special for $5. Food was average, the burgers were very creative in design and left me very intrigued but I ordered grilled chicken and wasn't too impressed. If its not a burger there are maybe 5 or 6 other sandwiches to choose from and a hotdog or two. I cannot hate on the creativity of the ingredients and you could tell they were fresh, just for the prices of the food, the offering was not doing it for me. Served with fries and slaw, that overtake the basket you are served in. He enjoyed hos burger and said it was cooked as he asked but felt the same as I and was just \"meh\" with the whole experience. I may give it a shot again but can't say for sure.  Tried it out a second time and looooved the pulled pork sandwhich, he loved his too, cant remember the name of it but it was definitely a better time. We have been back a few times just for drinks so I bump this up to a 3 star! Glad to see things are improving because the ideas behind their food is rock solid."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot. Came here for a lunch. I had ordered the Thai chicken Sandwich which was ok. It wasn't anything to brag about but was decent. It kinda reminded me of diner food. I ended up eating most of it but it was on that big hero type of bread so it wasn't necessary to have that much bread for the amount of chicken in it. I ended up eating only the bottom layer of the bread along with the chicken. It had a peanut sauce on it which was good but the sandwhich was kinda dry overall.   The place is nice and big. I'm sure at night time it's a lot  of fun. It has that type of atmosphere- like it would be cool to come by with a bunch of friends and just watch a game on tv and have a few drinks. Obviously they have a ton of beers here- so if you're looking for a diverse amount of beer then check it out. I'm not a big beer person so I can't speak for that part lol   I only have one complaint about the place and sometimes when this happens it really can ruin an experience. I was there with quite a few people and we all ordered our food at the same time. No reason why all of that food shouldn't be brought out at the same time unless you're getting an appetizer or something. Anyway- everyone's food came out at the same time except ONE person. Like really?? It's probably best you just wait the extra ten mins and bring everyone's stuff out at the same time. It's kinda rude when that stuff happens. So one person was sitting there watching everyone eat while they waited an extra ten mins for their food. It's just a pet peeve of mine. So they lost points in my book with that little maneuver.   Overall- Not a bad place- but maybe stick to beers and hanging out if you go."}
{"text":"Had heard about Burgers 2 Beer from other visiting coworkers and trusted their word. Boy oh boy they were right...awesome for the foodies/hangry bunch as well as the drinkers in your party! Outstanding prices and indulgent food options! There is definitely something for everyone. Burgers ($5.99 for almost all on Mondays!!), wings (59 cents on Wednesdays!), sandwiches, salads, appetizers and they easily accommodate unique requests. Beer prices are fantastic with most drafts around $5 or less. Pitchers follow suit with great prices as well as specialty liquor drinks $6-$8. I had a fantastic peach manhattan for $7.99 and a Grapefruit IPA for $5/pint. The waitstaff is super attentive and very accurate. I love the atmosphere and will be back again before I leave town. It is located on Wilson Mills Rd across from Progressive Insurance, it is right off of the highway and easy to access. Worth a visit if you love good food, nice atmosphere and libations :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  I was in town due to a family members declining health, and during that time I went to B2B 4 times in two weeks.  The food was amazing.  I've ordered the Caribbean Kiss, Crab Dip, the Cod Strips, and the chicken and bacon quesadilla; and I've been pleased each time.  I took a friend there, and she ordered the BBQ wings, and she thought they were delicious.  I highly recommend B2B, and I look forward to going back when I return."}
{"text":"A great little restaurant where you won't leave hungry.  They give you a bit of everything you could ever want."}
{"text":"We got to this place when the kitchen was trying to \"catch up\", according to the host. We watched the host go in and out of the kitchen acting like he was forgetting things, counting something in his head and looking at all the empty tables in the place. 15 minutes later we finally got to sit down. Waiter was a bit better, but didn't refill drinks or check on us very often. The food, however, was amazing, and is the only reason that this place gets 3 stars. Work on customer service a bit more, and the place will be great!"}
{"text":"Burgers 2 Beer is a nice sports bar and the perfect place to grab some lunch or watch a game.  They have a large bar, an extensive beer list and a pretty great menu.  Both times I have been, I ordered the black bean burger.  It is always delicious and the fries are crispy and seasoned really well!   Another one of my favorite things here are the fried pickles.  They come with a really great chipotle ranch style dipping sauce. Over all I really love this place, one of the things i think they should get of is some cider beer.  I was with a friend one time and they only drink cider beer.  She was limited to having to get Red's Apple Ale.  At least one cider beer on tap would be a good idea."}
{"text":"Had bison burger. has a nice variety on burger menu. Like the happy hour with 3$ apps. Nice sport bar feel atmosphere. Will come back."}
{"text":"Great joint, their burgers are both tasty and remind me of home made burgers. I have stopped here to grab a beer and a buffalo burger and it was well worth the trip. The fries are only alright I would go for the sloppy tots or home mae chips instead. If the fries were a bit crispier this place would deserve 5 stars, otherwise they only get 4.5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was amazing! Got the good bad and ugly I must say it was delicious. My server Nikita  was the best, she made sure I had everything i needed and more... the wife and I will be back with the kids next time though!"}
{"text":"The Burgers are good - but the service is horrible. We have been on several occasions and each time was the same experience."}
{"text":"Great food and staff ! Love it here. First time to be here and they made us feel very welcome here tonight.  Thanks David Lopez manager of this place, a very nice man  The burgers were great and big!"}
{"text":"So disappointed in yesterday's visit here. Waited an hour for our meals, and 3 of our 3 burgers were hockey pucks we all ordered med-med well. Actually, a hockey puck may have been easier to eat. Why even bother asking how you want them cooked when they're just gonna come out burnt anyways? Fries were brown from being in the fryer so long. I honestly think the cook fell asleep during shift. The appetizer chips with the artichoke dip were all stale. And bartender didn't even acknowledge the 4 of us until we said \"excuse me\". Probably the worst overall dining experience I've ever had. This is my first yelp review ever so that tells you something. They should've been way more prepared since literally right outside their front door was a street festival which ended at 10pm."}
{"text":"I went on burger night, I sat at the bar, the service was a bit slow. The bartender was pleasant when she was available. She did say there was a incident with a customer right before I arrived and that they were still dealing with it. I ordered the Vampire Hunter burger and it was excellent, and I washed it down with a few Bürger beers.  With the burger being on special my whole bill was less than 12 bucks before tip, not bad for a great burger and three beers."}
{"text":"So happy to see Burger2Beers is Open! We stopped in for a quick bite to eat on a Sunday! Great TV's everywhere to watch the game from all angles. Brittany greeted us very enthusiastically and also was our waitress. She was awesome, knowledgeable and easy to talk with, the burgers are amazing!! We truly believe they will give FlipSide a run for their money!! Our dinner was delicious! Can't wait to go back and try a totally different burger! Thanks Brittany for making our dining experience a great one!"}
{"text":"Fun place to get a uniquely topped burger, fries & shakes - also other fun bar type food. very college feeling place - clean - we could imagine a good crowd hanging out watching a game. Could use a few mire tv's but it's relatively new. The staff was fun and helpful and the wait for food was not bad. (10-15 minutes & not busy)we split the Oh Cheeseus & fried - literally a burger between two frilled cheese sandwiches, Burger cooked perfectly and it was surprisingly light.  Fries were lightly crunchy on. the outside & flaky in the inside. Strawberry shakes tasted hand dipped. Kitchen out front where u place your order & they bring it to you. Full cozy bar in the back.  Will def come again. only draw back was as the grill got cranked up the front area filled up with smoke."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour stop!! $2 well drinks and $3 long islands!! Doesnt get much better than that. Always something nee to try with their Burger of the month specials.  Would give 5 stars but kinda slow even when the place is not busy.  Milk Shakes with Vodka!! (Love lunch!!)"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game. Great beer selection. Great little corner location and easy parking options around the restaurant. Had wings and some appetizers. No complaints here other than the slower than usual service. It wasn't busy but...I've recieved far worse service. I'd give it another try mainly due to the atmosphere and food selection."}
{"text":"I love the variety that Burgers 2 Beer has to offer. Not just a typical burger place. Lots of awesome beers to pick from and fantastic drinks!"}
{"text":"My cousin has been talking about this place ever since he found it. He took me to this place because I was craving burgers and wings. I have to say best burger I have ever had in OHIO!! There were so many varieties to choose from. Can please any pickie eater!"}
{"text":"I had an entirely pleasant experience at Burgers 2 Beer, and I don't know why people seem to dislike it so much.  The burger I had, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, was tasty and everything I expected it to be. The fries were fresh cut and delicious, and even the salad I started with, Nature's Bounty, was good.   The beer list, at least compared to places like the Winking Lizard and B Spot, was somewhat lacking. But, they had Great Lakes Christmas Ale when I went, and I would have gotten that no matter how large a beer list was in front of me.  The service was good, too, so essentially I have nothing to complain about. It was a good dinner and I think 4-stars is more than warranted."}
{"text":"Really delicious burgers in a very laid-back setting. GET the \"like butta baby\" burger. It's out of this world! The roll of paper towels on the tables are a nice touch as the food get messy to eat."}
{"text":"LOVE this place, I have taken many family members here and everyone loves it! Burgers and fries are great like to try a new one every time I have gone. LOVE the beer sampler amazing deal and great way to try a variety of the drafts. They also have great weekly specials, we recently on a Tuesday because it was happy hour drink prices all day to find out that it was also kids eat free with $10 adult purchase smart planning on their part!!! I have passed that on to my friends and know we will be back to take advantage of that again!"}
{"text":"The best thing on the appetizers is the macaroni bites.  I had the wasabi salmon, it was ok and my wife had the turkey burger it was good."}
{"text":"Had a burger here a couple weeks ago. The burger was perfectly cooked and the service was fast and pleasant. The staff was very cordial even though they had a big lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I've ordered here twice from the \"SkipTheDishes\" service. Both times they forgot a small portion of our order. I can understand once but twice shows their lack of process and organization. The second time we ordered from here my wife and I both got sick. Which is strange because all of our food was totally overcooked and tasteless. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant... which is a shame because I really wanted to like it!"}
{"text":"This place has potential; the food is delicious. My burger was divine except for 1 thing: the gluten-free bun I ordered wasn't toasted or grilled. GF bread ALWAYS should be toasted because it tastes better. That's not to say I am ungrateful for the GF option!!  Far from it!  We sat at the bar on Saturday night. 2 bartenders on Saturday?? Really? That is probably why service was slow and uneven, hence the 3-star rating. Gentleman friend raved about his food and made jokes about the slow service, which saved the date. Then we went to another local place for nightcaps, and there, the bartenders provided excellent service.   I will return here in the future--my burger was THAT good. I will request a toasted bun! This place would be stellar if service is improved."}
{"text":"Time of visit 6:30 P.M. on Monday (Burger Night)  First time visit and for the quality of food we got and good service to boot, I'm betting we hit it at a strangely non-busy time - My theory was that since it was still almost 80 degrees and (please) spring seems to have finally arrived, there were other \"patio\" places that drew the crowds away from B2B on this their $5 burger night.   I had the Fungi - which as you might guess has mushrooms, paired with smoked gouda, garlic sauce and arugula - and I added bacon. Asked for it medium rare and it was a whisper more to the medium than rare side, but it was still juicy so that's what matters. Now as I ate, I kept thinking... there's something missing, I just don't know what. It was just bland somehow... and I came up with what I thought would have made it great, and that was some of those canned, french-fried onions. Given their abundant choices, I'm actually surprised they don't already have those as an option.   Dining companion had the Hot and Bothered burger: A blackened burger patty with habanero cheddar cheese, grilled onions, tomatoes, lettuce, jalapenos & sriracha mayo - which he said was really good.   Fries were pretty standard but hey, fries matter. If I have limp fries, I feel like that was wasted money. These were crispy and perfectly seasoned.   We also tried an order of the honey BBQ wings and they were meaty and the sauce was very tasty.   They do lose some points with me for having high fructose corn syrup in their table bbq sauce, and so likely in their wing and various kitchen sauces. HFCS is pretty much government sanctioned make-you-fatter poison. Research it kiddos.   That aside, we will be back and I might even bring my own can of french-fried onions!  PS: I definitely hope that there are no kids running around as another reviewer shared. I would agree that for the kind of business it is, it should be a no-kids kind of place. That's just me - as I get older I have no tolerance for kids, especially when it comes to restaurants."}
{"text":"Not sure why there is bad reviews.    Burgers were very good and interesting selection.   This is a gormet burger place, so it is not a five guys.   Beer is good with good selection on tap (best way to drink a beer).   They also have a pitcher deal too.     Service was good... But it was slow."}
{"text":"First - let me say, I am a BIG fan of Burgers 2 Beer.  I loved all of my experiences at the Solon, OH location.  My wife and I waited with great anticipation for the Lakewood restaurant to open.  We originally heard it would be ready by end of August to early September.  Good thing we didn't hold our breath!  Finally it is open and we eagerly made our trip on Monday.  Sadly, based on my experience at this location and how we were treated I don't think this place is going to make it for very long unless they get through these growing pains quickly.  I've helped open an establishment before and I know that when the timeline is pushed back there is a rush to open the doors - I'm hoping they can recover from what I can only call a very rough start.  First, we arrived at 4:45 to grab a quick meal before I left town for work.  We were pleasantly surprised to see that there were $5 burgers on Monday nights.  However, they wouldn't grant us that deal until 5:00, even at 4:52.  Unfortunately we were in a time crunch to get a quick meal in so I could stay on-time with my travel arrangements.  It wasn't a huge deal, but you'd think that a place that just opened would be eager to make their patrons first visit a pleasurable one.  If I were running the place I would have made a bet that discounting our burgers on this first occasion would pay off in the long run.  Anyway, we weren't too disappointed, just shocked that 8 minutes made a difference to them.  We browsed the menu and made our picks.  My wife had the Breakfast Burger with fries and I had the Vampire Slayer with Tater Tots.  The breakfast burger comes topped with a fried egg.  My wife does not like runny yolk so she always orders over hard.  It came out over-medium and too runny for her taste.  We looked around for our waiter, but he was not to be seen.  After waiting about 5 minutes she picked up her plate and caught the attention of some nearby staff (we think he was the manager).  He was pleasant about it and ordered a new egg and after another 5 minutes it came out correctly.  By this time I was just about done with my burger and was starting to eat the over-medium egg that my wife rejected.  I know - not fair for me to eat while she waited to get her food, but I did give her several bites and she graciously egged me on to eat while my meal was still warm.  The Vampire Slayer tasted good at first, but by the end I really wasn't wowed.  It wasn't bad, but it didn't make my taste buds jump like some of the other menu selections (Nut Butter, Hot Mess, Hot and Bothered).  The tots tasted a little bit burnt or over-fried - although my 8 month old son loved them!  My wife's review was: \"If I had it to do over again, I just would have gone to Five Guys.\"  The check came and our meals weren't discounted for the inconvenience of getting my wife's order wrong.  Maybe we didn't sound upset enough - we really aren't loud people, but considering that we had already asked for them to accommodate the $5 burger night and were refused, it again seems like they could have reversed this decision based on the circumstances.  The LAST THING that happened absolutely infuriates me to this moment.  I wished we had not been in a hurry because I would have made a bigger stink about this.  As we were getting ready to leave, my wife scraped her arm on a large splinter that came out of the edge of the table.  By large splinter, I mean there was a clearly visible gouge in the table the size of a golf tee.  It was still rough and a safety concern to whoever sat at the table later that night.  If she had not been wearing long sleeves, it definitely would have done bodily harm to her arm.  I tried to get the attention of the manager, but he was on the other side of the restaurant on the phone.  As we needed to leave, I caught the waiter's attention and told him what just happened and expressed concern for the safety of whoever sat there next.    I was appalled at this reaction.  He acted like it was no big deal.  \"Thanks for bringing that to my attention, we'll be sure to sand that down later.\"  No apology.  No concern.  No questions like \"are you alright?  Can I get you a band-aid?\"  He very awkwardly thanked us for coming out - this now for the third time (once as he delivered the check, another as he took my card).  You know - it's the thing that waiters and waitresses say at the end of the meal to make sure you remember to tip them well.  There's no shame in it - it's good practice.  Shows you care.... the FIRST TIME you do it.  He clearly had no idea how to react and was just trying to get rid of us.  I hate to write such a negative review, and I hope I haven't sounded too whiny.  My wife and I are very quiet and almost never complain about service.  This was just unacceptable in my view and so I had to come and write about it.  As I mentioned, I LOVE B2B.  I hope the Lakewood management figures out how to pull it together with better food and better service before its too late!!"}
{"text":"Once again, my experience at Burgers 2 Beer was lackluster. We were seated for about 7 minutes before anyone even stopped by. It took 35 minutes to get food once we did order. The waitress spilled ranch dressing all over my leg and shoe and although she did apologize, there was no goodwill attempt here.   I think this place must just be managed poorly. Our servers are always fine and the hostess pleasant as well.  I just don't get how you are never prepared for the lunch rush and food takes so long."}
{"text":"The food at Burgers 2 Beer is inconsistent, but generally pretty decent. Burgers are served hot, cooked well, no soggy buns.  My issue-- and it's a big one-- is the service. There's an issue every single time we dine in or order from this place. I work nearby and we often order take out.   Some recent examples: * Added onion randomly to a wrap that doesn't even come with onion * I placed a take out order at 3:15 for pick up at 5 pm. When I arrived at 5 pm it wasn't ready. I didn't leave the place with food until 5:12.  * Dining in- servers are never rude, but also never very friendly * Placed an order online, they never received it * Doesn't answer phone  *When we order at work, at least 2 of our 12 orders are wrong or just downright missing  Because of the convenience, it's likely I'll be back here. I just hope they can get their ish together. We've seen a lot of restaurants cycle through this location and I'm sure something else can slot in there if they keep screwing up!"}
{"text":"This place is just so - so.  It lacks many things.  There's nothing new, different, outstanding or distinctive about this place.  The atmosphere is...\"chain owned.\"  Which is ok if it is run well with good food. I'd say the service is adequate.   They did have a good choice of beers on tap. Although there was nothing on special for cheap. Like $3 pints of Labatts, Budweiser etc... Especially during Tribe time. Or I missed it.  As for the food, I ordered wings and fries.  Wings were cooked just right and tasted fresh. The wing sauce was lacking in flavor.  The fries were ok, on the greasy side. There wasn't much to choose from as sides go.  Way too much fried choices.  No baked potato or steamed vegetable etc.  I would come back to try one of their burgers - served with mashed potatoes and corn!  So why aren't the mashed potatoes or corn a choice for sides on the menu?  The most disappointing thing about B2B is the prices. Overpriced for what you get. $5 for a side of fries? And you can't choose a small order of anything,  except the wings.    It is a great location for a restaurant.  Excellent window and people watching action. The bar has many seats! And I love to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Yuk yuk yuk terrible food used to have great fries now they use frozen. The burgers are dry and over cooked. Had chili to it was ice cold. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Up and down location, much like the food.  The good news is that when they get it right, they get it very right.  But that means when they get it wrong...  So I give it 4 stars because my last experience included an amazing burger, good fries, and decent priced beer.  A previous experience included a grocery store burger patty, uninspired assembly, and a confused beer list.  This time I went with the monthly special burger with jalapeño cornbread and the whole deal on top.  The cornbread was interesting, but delicious and really worked well.  The gf had a Like Butta Baby recommended by the waitress and she was in Butta love.  Our waitress was super nice, but got lost a few times and apparently had some issues with the bar and the kitchen.  What's that?  Oh yea you caught on to the bad things.  When being sat down, the hostess couldn't really care less.  When ordering beer, they were out of the first 2 choices.  It took a while to get the burgers.  The place wasn't all that busy.  So it's a solid burger joint in Solon.  Annex is still #1 but sometimes everyone needs a little strange...burger joint.  Seems like the specials would really be good way to enjoy it."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and look forward to returning soon.  The food is always great.  But be warned:  it's hard to make a decision because the entire menu looks sooooo good!   My goal: try every burger."}
{"text":"It's a casual greasy spoon burger joint with tons of beer. Good food if you want to have a heart blockage. That said, don't try to be healthy because the salads are lame. If only the cheese sauce was real. But nothing here is. Even the sugar packets are generic brands. I do love the fries though. I can certainly do without greasy half-washed tables but, again, it is a greasy burger joint. Don't expect perfection. Come for a beer. But not a draft. Do the math on the sizes and it never adds up. Better off sticking to bottles."}
{"text":"Food was only okay. Menu is overpriced for no reason at all. Service was mediocre. No reason to return."}
{"text":"So glad I stopped in here. I had been craving a good burger for a while and the Vampire Hunter was perfect. The place is comfortable, staff is friendly and generous. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Overcooked burgers, slow service, nothing special.  Wish we would have gone to Grind instead.  The interior is very nice, however, and very clean.  And while the service was slow, the bartenders were pleasant."}
{"text":"Great new casual dining spot in Lakewood. Tons of big screen TVs. Menu was huge. Definitely going back to try more of the options.  Specialty burgers were great. Highly recommend the sloppy joes and French toast options. Staff was also super friendly."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find this spot right across the street from my office.  Great happy hour specials for food & drink and all my fav items on the menu....mac & cheese, Texas chili, tator tots and yummy burgers.  I preferred this burger joint to the local B-spot and 5 Guys chain (which is saying a lot since I grew up with 5 guys!)  The staff is friendly, if a little thin during the day.  The outdoor seating is small and has a lot of road traffic but at night I'm sure the noise from the bar drowns out the roadway."}
{"text":"Travelling to Cleveland from Columbus quite a bit since son has been at Case for 4 years, and have been in the hunt for the best burger in Cleveland. Tried Flannery's (pretty darn good), Heck's (meh), and Academy Tavern (uhh, no). And the best burger winner (so far) is B2B! Ate here 2 days in a row, and the burger was delicious both times. The meat was cooked perfectly--the second day I asked for it with \"no pink\" and it had a great crust on the outside, still juicy on the inside. A hugely thick burger is not necessarily a good burger (I'm looking at you, Academy Tavern), but at B2B, the meat-to-bun ration is just right. Buns are fresh and have a touch of sweetness. Had a Hot and Bothered burger with a plethora of spicy trimmings the first time (spicy, good, but a little overpowering). The next day, I went simple with just grilled onions, ketchup, and mayo, which was really the way to go. The juices from the hot-off-the-grill meat blended with the condiments into the perfect sauce--just wonderful! I could really taste the meaty goodness of the burger.  My son wasn't crazy about the fries, but he does not care for the skin-on hand cut style of French fry.The don't get real crisp.  The service was fast and friendly (we were here early, not too busy), and David, the owner, checked in to make sure everything was good. As we were leaving, I heard him compliment his staff on the job they were doing. Good business, and a super good burger! (Next time, I'm definitely trying the onion rings!)"}
{"text":"I've eaten at B2B several times and have always had consistently delicious food. Their wings are fantastic. Meaty & Crispy!  Their burgers are top notch!  I've tried several different styles and all have been perfect!  The Oh Cheezus is insane! Last Saturday I had the Clubber and it was mighty tasty. Seriously...some of the best burgers I've had around here! They've always got a great beer selection, too!  I can count on trying something new here with every visit.  I've seen several other reviews complain about the service. I've never had a problem in that department. Every time I've been there the staff has been quick and friendly.  My only complaint? (Well, besides for the amount of kids in the place...but that's not the establishment's fault!) Anyhow...my complaint?  The dining area was filthy last Saturday night. We were seated at a sticky table surrounded by dirty napkins on the floor. (Which probably could be traced back to any number of the kids in the place!) It made me sad. Whoever was responsible for clean-up really dropped the ball.  Great food, good service, not so great housekeeping."}
{"text":"Very very average. Good service but burgers are nothing special. Macaroni bites were  disappointing as they were as good as frozen ones from the grocery store."}
{"text":"Consistently average. I have always found the food to be good enough. I do like that you can build your own burger with some nice toppings. I personally like the fried egg with bacon and cheddar cheese. Tots are solid as well."}
{"text":"The service was friendly, but slow. It took nearly an hour for lunch and we left after only eating half our burgers due to a fussy baby!   The food was OK, but there are much better burger places.  They do get points for creativity on the menu. We started with the \"Me So Corny\" appetizer- basically fried cream corn. It was tasty, but nothing spectacular.   I had the Hot Mess burger, which had sloppy joe, red onions, green peppers and fried onions on it. It was definitely messy. The sloppy joe had good flavor, but the burger on its own was pretty tasteless. There were way too many red onions- they overwhelmed the flavor of everything. I felt the green pepper pieces should've been cut smaller for an easier bite, especially since it's already a messy meal.  My husband had the Vampire Hunter burger, with no pepperoni. He wasn't impressed. We might give it a second try. I'm almost always willing to give places a second chance and they did have a lot of creative items to taste. We'll see..."}
{"text":"I was a little surprised to see a burger joint opening up in Lakewood. After all, if Five Guys, Streat Burger, and Eddie & Eddie (which occupied the same space) couldn't hack it, what chance does Burgers 2 Beer have? I was also bummed that Cerino's closed. It was a nice addition to the neighborhood.  I had to check it out anyway. As soon as my boyfriend heard they had a burger with a donut for a bun (the Luther), our decision was made. The burgers were good, though not at good as Jammy Buggars in my opinion. My dad had the hot dog which was enormous! So be prepared for that if you go the hotdog route. I had the Vampire Burger which was quite tasty. I don't like dream about it or anything, but it was good and the price was right.  The ambiance leaves a lot to be desired, although I did enjoy that the tables were from A Piece of Cleveland. If you like getting a burger in a place with giant TVs, then this is your place."}
{"text":"Plain and simple its a burger joint, but a really good burger joint with a good selection of beer.  The music selection was great.  Quite a good selection of burgers as well.  Would go ahead"}
{"text":"we had a long day and hadn't eaten and we're worried nothing would be open this late on a Sunday. well decided to take a chance and check out Burgers 2 Beer.   walk in and TVs all over the walls so that was wonderful as the Cavs are in the playoffs and are.. Winning!!  Sat down and the menus are so sticky that didn't take the time to really look at menu.   a wonderful beer selection  they were out of 4 beers.. I decided to order the build your own burger  with provolone and lettuce and cooked per my request.  hubby ordered The Luther which is a burger and honey pepper bacon and America Cheese all housed under a glazed donut.  he said mighty tasty.   ea are served with frys which were ok. and if u ask for coleslaw they will bring that.  the catsup bottles were sticky and practically empty.  When ordered my beer Stella!!!! I had asked for ice water and side of mayo. When our food was delivered didn't see the waitress  and burger about finished and finally got water and  mayo.   plates not cleared and the person next to us  was not waited on for over 5 min.  the service would make me really not want to return. but Hubby really enjoyed his burger."}
{"text":"Food and service were great! The bartender, Andy, is awesome. His menu suggestions were on point, and he made me the best martini I've ever had! Be sure to sit at the bar when you go there so you too can have the best service ever by Andy!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place close to my hotel for a burger and beer.  The guy at the desk recommended this place.  Good choice.  Short drive and plenty of parking.  Went inside and found a Cheers type sports bar atmosphere.  The bar was even shaped like Sam Malone's place.  Lots of TVs with different sports programming.  It wasn't very crowded but it was just 5:30.    I sat at the bar and was immediately greeted.  They have a large beer selection and various Happy Hour specials.  I ordered a burger and tall Fat Tire. The beer was good and cold.  The burger was delivered very quickly.  It was excellent.  I had a large, juicy burger cooked exactly as ordered.  It came with a nice sized order of fries.    Good food, good service and reasonable prices make this a place I would return to if back in the area."}
{"text":"The hamburger my wife and I tried was one of the worst we ever tasted. Would suggest someone going anyplace else. 5 Guys would be an excellent alternative."}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong with a burger place that sells a burger on a donut or on french toast. The menu is unique, spread out. B2B has salads, sandwiches, and an extensive burger list. Also a great environment for watching a sporting event or just grabbing a few drinks with your buddies. The service team was very friendly, aside for a small register problem, I would recommend this to anybody. I dropped a star off the 5 star rating due to the food coma I am in now, and can't even think about eating a burger in the near future, but it was amazing while I was consuming."}
{"text":"was recommended by our hotel to come and check this place out, and it did not disappoint. we just wanted a good burger place, and this was very good. the burgers were crazy good in flavor and seasonings. I was really taken back by the beer and cider selection that they had in house, I went for a cider that I couldn't get from home, even though it was very dry I was very happy with the flavor of it.  great food, great staff, and just a great environment to either come and eat or play a couple of games.  the pool table is a must!"}
{"text":"I'm feeling generous. Consensus was between 3 & 4 so we'll go with 4 since we don't have halvesies as an option. Pros: big menu, lots of options, lots of things looked good!!! Cons: burger is just eh \"why is burger in your name if they're just okay\". We don't get it. Also con: server was an apathetic (who doesn't get excited to sell a French toast burger?) and awkward. \"Vulturous\" was the word my friend used. It was 50 cent wing night - the wings were good. Hence the generous star delegation.   I would come here again. But I just wasn't thrilled this time.   Why is there a broken electronic basketball game in front of the only Cavs game tv we can see?"}
{"text":"The second we walked in, they told us they were out of burgers.... We got our food before our appetizer. We had to go up and ask where our appetizer was. It came out 10 min later. As I was waiting in line, a girl told me that her fried food was undercooked. Another told me that she waited 40 min. This place is embarrassing."}
{"text":"This place would have gotten 2 starts if not for the crappy service and obnoxious bus boy who plowed me over to get to our table as we left.  I get it, this place is new and busy but the more you eye my table and talk to your coworkers while pointing at us the longer I will sit at my table and sip my beer while your wait gets longer.  Geesh, learn how to run a restaurant!!  The food was eh - if I'm going to splurge on a calorie filled burger  I'm going to pick somewhere else.  Like 5 Guys.  Or  Swensons.  Or even Wendy's b/c their new burger was better than this place!!!  My burger was dry and tasteless.  I will not be back.  I will say that my husband and our friend had better things to say about their meals, but it wasn't enough to sway my opinion."}
{"text":"Used to be a great place. Now terrible service and not worth the price. Only gave two stars because I like the owner, just this locations management is bad."}
{"text":"Okay so I had my reservations going there based on the reviews. Walked through the doors with the deer in headlights look....two staff members noticed and got a kick out of it (in a nice, friendly way). The female pointed me back to the bar area where a few other people hanging out. I went around 4ish today (8/8/15). I already had in mind what I wanted...The Luther!  I've heard about this and was always super curious how this burger, sandwiched between a glazed donut, would taste.  My bartender/server was Sheila...super friendly, engaging person. When the burger finally came, I was a little anxious and didn't know what to expect. Good, the Luther was actually pretty tasty. Using the glazed donut, it is definitely something different...no need to add condiments to the burger...the sweetness is enough. There are other menu items I wanted to try but I was short on time and didn't want to overstuff myself. I would definitely go back, nice convenient location."}
