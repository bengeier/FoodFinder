{"text":"I'd been here a few years ago and didn't like it much. But I went here for a friends birthday today and the food was surprisingly good! The hummus is very garlicky so just average. The ezme (eggplant) and walnut spread is spectacular. The mixed grill was tasty especially the kebab; chicken was tasty but a tad dry. Bulgur was good, rice bland. It is more expensive than Lebanese restaurants in Toronto but reasonably good Turkish food in a city that has very few Turkish restaurants. :)"}
{"text":"I feel like the odd one out writing this review after reading all the others. But I honestly can't believe how this restaurant has so many good reviews. It's mind-boggling. Many our experience was an off day. I went here with my husband, my mom and my grandma. We have tried and enjoyed many Turkish restaurants before but this one was an absolute disappointment. My grandma and I both had the lamb kebab, hers well done and mine medium rare. The meat was so tough and chewy that I could barely get it down. My grandmother gave up after having one piece. The rice was bland and the spinach and feta cheese crepe my mother ordered also had no taste. Putting boiled spinach and feta on a piece of toast would have produced the same result. We had ordered the veggies dips meze appetizer and the dips were good. 

Now on to the service. They asked us if we wanted more bread, to which we said yes and the bread never came. After 20 minutes after server asked us if we wanted more bread to which again we said yes. Finally after another 10 min we got a small half order of bread ( to which I later learned we were charged 1.50 for). Our entrees arrived at different times with my mother's taking the longest. We finally asked if her food was coming to which the server replied 'was there an error in the kitchen?\". Umm what? There was no error in how we ordered. After we tried to eat some of our mains, they asked if we wanted dessert to which we said no thank you. We then waited for a long time before we could    get their attention to ask for our bill. Overall very disappointing experience and I would never go back. The very pricey bill for 4 mains, a couple drinks and an app soured my mood further. Really not worth it. I could have myself made better Turkish food at home with some lamb from No Frills (that's how bad the meat was). Or had a kebab from a fast food spot."}
{"text":"Really great quality turkish food. The cigaras, iskender and eggplant dish are out of this world. The interior is very cute too. 
Just one star off for the small(ish) portions."}
{"text":"After having tried real Turkish cuisine in Istanbul I can assure you, the food here is authentic ! We had one of the big family platters so we had a chance to try most of their kebabs. Everything was on point and delicious! Service was excellent, we got complimentary dessert in addition to the free Turkish coffee for checking into the restaurant on Yelp. A little on the pricey side but worth coming to every once in a while. After all real Turkish cuisine is so few and far between in the GTA!"}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant. Have had difficulty booking reservations for the belly dancing evening - small/limited capacity. Looking forward to being able to go sometime this summer."}
{"text":"Great service, the food was pretty good.,small place, eclectic menu, not too many options."}
{"text":"This place has been on my must-try list for a while now. I grew up in a suburban neighborhood with a large Turkish population and miss the local Turkish restaurants of my youth! Anatolia did not disappoint. We had the Meze platter followed by the Doner special and the grilled Mixed Plate for our main. Tasty and generous portions. Will be back to try some of their other specialties!"}
{"text":"From the second you step into this restaurant, you are greeted by the friendly staff. The dining space is decorated creatively, with cultural touches that light up the restaurant. It was family friendly but sophisticated and had meals to fit everyone's taste. 
The servers were quick and friendly and the service was fast. The menu had many different choices including vegetarian options. The Gozleme, mixed veggie plate, Mediterranean large salad and meze large tabagi, a platter of four delicious spreads and baskets of fresh bread, were all scrumptious. The food was all extremely fresh, appetizing, and reasonably priced. Overall, I definitely recommend the Anatolia Restaurant and cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"Hello,
I am new to Yelp, so happy to see a recent review of a favourite restaurant - Anatolia.

I often go there on the first Friday of each month, for the fix prixe - belly dancing evening, complete with live band.

The food is marvellous,  the hospitality is superb, the service good and the entertainment is terrific.  My favourite dancer Maryada, does not dance there anymore, but the new dancers are very good.

Try it out, I am sure you will like it.

Sincerely,
Suzanne Manvell"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time this year and was very delighted by the friendly staff, art work, and authentic feel. Will be coming back in the future :)"}
{"text":"Here's another well deserved 5 star review to add to the many written about this great, unassuming little place.  I've lived close by for the past few years and have always passed by and been slightly curious, but never super compelled to come into this little place set in this strip mall. Well thank god for Yelp, or else I never would have known what a gem this was only 5 minutes from me!

The food here is about as fresh and wholesome as it gets.  This is a family run business (members of which who serve you and are all super friendly!!) and they are proud to proclaim in their menu, website and in person about the freshness of their ingredients and how everything is homemade.  The salads are incredibly fresh (I love the shepard's salad that comes with several dishes and can be ordered on its own) and simple.  The eggplant, hummous, potato and other various dips are standouts and are incredibly delicious.  There is such a variety, including a great selection for vegetarians and vegans.  The meat dishes are spiced beautifully and the food is very authentically Turkish (my dad's gf who is European and travelled to Turkey many times swears this and LOVES this place).  You have to try the strong Turkish coffee here and the desserts are SO GOOD - they are simple you you can really tell how fresh and homemade they are.  I love how all of the food here is so simple and healthy and you really can tell this family loves and cares about their culture and its food.

Apparently every month they have a special night that sells out with a special dinner menu and belly dancing that you have to book ahead for - we are dying to go and planning to go next month!  Anatolia is now a favourite and a real Toronto hidden gem- if you are craving some real Turkish, wholesomely made food or just want to try something different that usual (Etobicokians-come out and try something different and support this business!) you gotta come here!  This is a great example of how Yelp leads to the discovery of some real amazingness :)"}
{"text":"i only went to this restaurant once and i must say i really liked the food there. The decor was really nice, though when i went it was not busy. The portions are kind of small, but you could share amongst you and the other people you're with. I went with a friend and we ordered a decent amount of food and it costed us about 55-65 dollars (which isnt toooooo bad) but it is a little pricey. 
The wait staff are really friendly, so is the manager/ It is so worth going."}
{"text":"We went here for our wedding rehearsal dinner, and the food and service were spectacular! We ordered what we thought would be enough food for 12-15 people, but it was enough for 25 people, with leftovers! Definitely coming here again, and would recommend it to anybody in an instant!"}
{"text":"Anatolia has been a going concern for at least 10 years, and most folks say the same thing.
1) The food is generally pretty good, depends on how busy they get, and who's cooking.
2) The portions are usually a wee bit on the small side. I've been going to Anatolia for at least 10 years, and, to make up for portion size, I pig out on the breads and appetizers.
3) The music nights, with palm readers and belly dancers who are many times better than the ones in the top Restaurants in Taksim Square, make anyone's night really worth while.
4) If you can't afford Istanbul, Anatolia is a pretty good second.
5) Don't gripe about the prices, you are helping Aysha make a living from a pretty small floor area."}
{"text":"Great food and ambience. After coming back from Istanbul just two months ago, I am so happy to be able to have authentic Turkish food again!"}
{"text":"Tried take out from Anatolia for the first time tonight and was very satisfied. Had the Anatolia mixed plate as well as the shrimp appetizer. Loved it! I'll be back and will bring my friends. The place as a warm authentic vibe."}
{"text":"Very cute and cozy place. Tried their lahmajoun and a kabab dish. Both were pretty good. I\"m not an expert on Turkish food, but I liked them. 

Turkish coffee was included with the meal if you checked in on Yelp. Yayy :) Needed some espresso kick to wake myself up."}
{"text":"Fabulous Turkish restaurant in the Six-Points area of Etobicoke.

The decor is simple, the staff friendly.

The food is marvellous, especially the sauces, purees, dips and spreads.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent food!   Small place tucked away in Etobicoke, Dundas and Kipling area.   Pleasant decor, clean, smiling staff.  The food, no question about it, is EXCELLENT.  Why reasons why I gave a 3 star rating...white wine must be chilled, pop was flat and room temperature.   Staff needs to give input when we order.   We ordered two salads as well as eggplant, grill platter for the table.   Staff should have let us know that we totally over-did the salad as it just kept coming and coming.   Everything we ordered came with salad.   We had to start sending it back to get it packed to go while dining.  The four spreads we got for the appetizer were excellent.  The roasted eggplant and grill platter were excellent as well.  Will definitely go back, hopefully they can work on the staff for a more pleasant dining experience, ask wait staff to remind certain dishes and try and explain what we are getting a bit better. Really glad we found this little gem."}
{"text":"Was missing Istanbul & was looking for some place that would make fresh pita and dips, so found this place online. 
It was towards the end of dinner time but luckily they had everything that we wanted. The pita was on the house, black sea chicken was descent, sauteed shrimp was better, couscous was amazing. Tea , coffee & desert were all pretty good.
The taste is not as authentic as I had in Turkey, but overall it was a good experience in Tofonto.
Bill for 2 was almost $100 with tip n taxes but its definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"A fantastic Turkish restaurant!  We head there every time my in-laws are in town.  The food the delicious and the portions are great.  We normally order \"family style\", which is getting a hole bunch of dishes to share around the table.  Usually, this includes the resto's Mixed Grill that has lamb, chicken and beef koftes and a few other dishes such as the Gozleme for my wife who won't eat red meat.

Ayse, the owner/cook frequently comes out to say hi and when we brought in our newborn girl, she disappeared to the back and brought our baby girl an evil eye charm for her car seat.

I say this because I want to highlight the service and the very personal nature of the restaurant.  We're probably a very memorable family because of the constant but good-natured squabbling that happens over the ordering every time we're there."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Toronto restaurants. I only wish it wasn't so far from where I live--I'd go more often! I've eaten here many times and enjoyed every dish I've tried, especially the cigara appetizer and the manti entree. A friend of mine who lives nearby had never tried it until I took her there, because the storefront didn't appeal--it's in a little strip plaza--but she really liked it, so don't judge it by the outside. NB: Don't park in front of the Caribbean restaurant--the owner will have you ticketed."}
{"text":"If its your first time here get the Mixed Plate... It's amazing and gives you a taste of all the awesome Turkish flavours. Every time I come here I am impressed about the service and the quality of the food. If you like flavourful food you can't not come here!"}
{"text":"discovered this place by chance, the food taste like home cooked. the service is great and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a wonderful Mothers Day lunch at Anatolia.  They accommodates our large group of 22 people.  They requested we pre-order our meals as they had only one grill and to minimize meal wait times - a great idea especially for the ones with little kids.  The food was fresh, delicious and very enjoyable.  Service was outstanding.  They were attentive throughout the meal.  At the end of the meal, all mothers were presented with a long stem red rose and a choice of a bangle or jewellery pouch (Turkish).  A wonderful experience for sure."}
{"text":"An amazing traditional Turkish restaurant with cozy ambiance and delicious food. This is my second time visiting this place and I am still impressed. The menu is quite interesting so there is lots to choose from. They also have a lot of veggie options as well, so it's a great place for those that are vegetarians.  Some of my favorite things to order here is the Meze Tabagi - a platter with various dips, which is perfect for sharing.  I also enjoyed the Manti dish - mini dumplings stuffed with meat and topped with yogurt.  So yummy! The staff is quite welcoming and friendly. This resturant is definately a  must try spot! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was Friday night and I was wrapping up a gazzilion things at work before I headed to my so deserved vacation. After running some errands I found myself hungry and too lazy to drive much. That's when I stumbled upon Anatolia Restaurant. A Turkish restaurant at the far end of Dundas West.

We had fresh pide bread with homemade hummus as an appetizer.

I had a Beyti- which I don't know if it is the name of a Turkish dish or just a reference to one of the most famous restaurants in Istanbul. My dish consisted of kebab like spicy ground beef and lamb, wrapped in hand made \"yufka\" pastry, all topped with a savory, light tomato sauce and drizzled with warm butter and a sprinkled with ground pistachios. Heavenly!

I also tried the Gozleme, which is made of fresh \"Yufka\", a Turkish style crepe filled with spinach, onions and feta cheese. Also fantastic! 

For dessert we shared a kuneffe (a traditional turkish dessert), a very thin and shredded pastry with cheese and pistachios. I have to admit that it was a bit more sweet that I can handle but it was delicious.

I'm so in love with Turkish food that I could eat every day."}
{"text":"Great priced food- delicious and very well flavored especially for someone like myself without a wealth of experience eating Turkish food, but who appreciates well seasoned and flavorful dishes. Great variety of food as well for meat eaters and vegetarians. Great and attentive service, overall very clean and the ambience was lovely; small and intimate feeling, with quite a crowd on the weekends so recommend reservations. Highly recommend- don't let the outside fool you. Only, and small gripe, is limited parking in the front."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening before heading to the theaters. 

There was a belly dance going on when we entered so it was quite noisy. The dance itself was decent and the dancer was engaging the audience as well. My only issue was that it was bit too loud. 

We ordered the kefte and iskender, both of which were good. The meat was tender and juicy. The spices were quite flavorful. The eggplant dish was good as well."}
{"text":"The first time we went to Anatolia (7pm, Saturday), we were politely turned away as the place was packed. They suggested we call to make a reservation first so today we did! When we went tonight though (8pm, Friday night), it was 80% empty so a reservation might not have been necessary but I would still recommend that you call first. Now on to the food.

We always turn to Yelp when we want to try new places, as well as what to try so that's what we did here. We ordered:

Yogurt drink - I was sold. But after one sip, my SO thought it was gross
Grilled calamari - Not what we had expected. It did not look or taste grilled at all, and it was just OK
Mixed plate - Now this was the bomb! The meat was tender and juicy, the salad crisp and fresh, and the serving was good enough for two 
Baklava - We've had better but it's good enough
Turkish coffee - Since we checked in we got this for free (thanks Yelp!) and it was awesome

Everybody gets bread for free and it was really, very good bread. Soft and freshly baked.

Our total bill came to almost $70 (including tip) for two people so it's a little pricey. Food is good though and maybe when a special occasion comes up that warrants a $70 dinner, we will come back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place! I spent some time in Istanbul over the summer and one of my favourite parts was the food. This wasn't quite up to par with some of the food I had there but it came pretty darn close.

Went there with a friend - we shared the Meze Tabagi as a starter (this was the only negative part of my experience - the waitress forgot to punch it in and we didn't get it until after our mains when we pointed it out). Otherwise, it was absolutely delicious! There were 4 dips - one with eggplant, one salsa-ish one, one hummus and the Ayse Walnut Spread that everyone rants about, which was without a doubt my favourite. It was served with Pide bread for dipping (which in case you were wondering is like pita but more bread-like and buttery mmm).

For the mains, we shared the Beyti and the Yogurtlu Adana which were both exquisite! The Beyti was a spicy ground beef & lamb in a crispy tortilla style pastry drizzled in a tomato sauce and pistachio, with a side of salad. The Yogurtlu Adana (as indicated by the name), is a similar beef/lamb mixture on a pile of pide bread and a side of yogurt. Both were really delicious but I like yogurt so I enjoy the yogurtlu a little bit more.

As an apology for missing our appetizer order, our waitress gave us complimentary baklava for dessert. Again, I've had better in Istanbul, I found this one a little bit too sweet. I prefer dryer and crispier for my baklava (but maybe that's also just me).

Everything was really fresh and delicious with a homemade feel. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I am creating a Yelp account to make this review. I have never had to deal with such an outrageous and violent man before. I came on a recommendation with a friend, and ordered the shrimp at the encouragement of the waitress (I do not eat meat). When it was served, I had one bite, and the shrimp was old and fishy. When the waitress finally came to check on how the meal was, I informed her that it was inedible, and she took it away without an apology or offer of resolution. When my dining partner finished their meal, we were brought a bill and I was surprised to see that the shrimp had not been removed from the bill. I asked to speak to the manager and he insisted that because I ordered it, I am obliged to pay for it, that it's not his responsibility to take the loss of the meal, regardless of quality, meanwhile confirming that the shrimp *was* indeed from frozen. He was belligerent and rude and refused any compensation beyond a free coffee. I refused to pay for a meal prepared with bad ingredients that I did not eat. The manager chased after me while I was leaving the restaurant with a verbal assault, and I rushed to enter the passenger side of my friends car, at which point the manager lunged toward me and yanked the car door open. I was terrified he was about to physically assault me. I struggled to shut the door while he kept trying to pull it open and finally managed to get it shut and then locked the door to prevent him from any further attempt. He then went back into the restaurant and returned to write down the license plate number of my friend's car (who had been happy with their meal, and paid for it) all the while yelling profanity. Apparently *some* of the food here is good, but the owner of this restaurant needs to do something about their psychopathic staff, and if unable to maintain fresh, quality inventory for specific dishes remove them from the menu entirely.

In response to your comment: I was rather upset after having been yelled at by your manager, and did go out the back for some air. When I was ready to leave, I walked through the restaurant and out the front door. There was zero miscommunication. He was agressive, nearing violent and I was terrified of him."}
{"text":"On a cold Friday night the wife and I went to Anatolia. We are relatively new to Etobicoke and have been trying a lot of places in the area. 

Every first Friday of the month they have a special Turkish cultural night with a belly dancer, live music and a set menu for $55. We opted to pick off the regular menu for a $5 cover charge per person. 

We ordered the 4 spread, mixed grill and manti dumplings. The spreads were just ok but the hummus was half frozen, not good. Manti dumplings were very rich but didn't taste like much. A bland tortellini in an oily sauce if that makes any sense. The mixed grill was decent but I've had much better at other places.  Best part was the bread that came with the spreads but they charged us 1.50 for an extra bread. We got even when they forgot to charge us for the baklava and Turkish tea. I'm not sure if the baklava was made in house but the wife really enjoyed the tea. 

The belly dancer show came on at 9 and was interactive and entertaining. 

The service was quite bad and very slow to even place our order.  People were clearing our table before we were done. I even had to ask for my napkin back to wipe my mouth. A spare chair was dragged from our table without asking as well. 

It wasn't a terrible meal but I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Good turkish food in etobicoke.  Our faves are the chicken skewers, lentil soup, and best are the dips (meze).  Service is usually very pleasant."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place is too expensive and overpriced, but the food is delicious. I had the Stuffed Artichokes and the Yogurtlu Adana (a kind of pide) and both were extremely good, I was glad I chose them.

While the prices are too high, the service was very friendly and they threw in a free baklava, so I will round it up to 4/5."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the food has been to die for! 

The apps are fantastic - I would recommend the dip platter as you try 4 different dips.

The mixed grill dinner option gives servings of lamb, beef and chicken, along with two types of rice. Oh and of course the delicious yoghurt. 

The decor and ambience of the place makes you feel like you are in Istanbul, and the servers make you feel right at home.

Also, if you check in with your Yelp app your receive a free Turkish coffee :) 

Overall a fantastic dinner place. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant multiple times, each time the food was amazing, delicious and clean. The service is great and the staff are very friendly. I totally recommend this restaurant if you are in for some delight."}
{"text":"I love this place.

After a bit of confusion regarding our seats, we were finally seated in a cozy corner. I was a tad frustrated and the server noticed it. I was hungry, I'm sorry. To make amends, she sent over a platter containing delicious dips and breads. 

For our main course, my fiancé and I enjoyed the platter for two (name?) and it was also delicious. 

Don't hesitate trying this restaurant. 

This restaurant made us feel like family. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"The first time I had Turkish food was at Anatolia. I didn't know what to expect so I asked the server for some recommendations. Everything she recommended was so delicious and well made. You could tell they really care about providing only the freshest and high quality food. The atmosphere is warm and lively and I really enjoyed my overall dining experience. The service was top notch as well. I recommend everyone try Turkish food at least once in their lifetime and if they're in the west end, they gotta eat here."}
{"text":"You know, if you have a hankering for actual Turkish food, it seems like you don't have a huge variety of selection to choose from. Fortunately, there's Anatolia.

Having just returned from Istanbul, I had gotten used to eating my kebab and other meats. Anatolia's menu had exactly what I wanted. Memories of Istanbul, they tasted pretty much how I remember them. It's not a hugely popular type of cuisine, but I would definitely recommend you check them out."}
{"text":"best baklava in toronto. great Turkish food. lovely, helpful staff. good sized portions and lots of items on menu."}
{"text":"\"Thinkin' of you's workin' up my appetite
looking forward to a little *turkish* delight.\"

Located at where Bloor and Dundas intersect and get confusing, this restaurant is a popular destination for traditional Turkish cuisine.

The service here is warm and friendly and they have a huge menu with meat and veggie options.

I sampled the hummus with the warm, soft bread at the table.  I should have bought some dips to take home, I forgot. :(

I ordered the mixed grill plate.  I wish I had someone to share the veggie mixed platter with too, it looked really good and I love vine leaves.

When my plate arrived, it looked great!  The kebobs were fragrant and the salad was nice and colorful with shredded beets and carrots.  The mixed platter ($18.95) had juicy chicken kebob and spiced beef and lamb which I smothered in garlicy yogurt.  

I'm sure I'll be back some time!
Earlier in the evening so I can have a Turkish coffee and not stay up all night."}
{"text":"We went for lunch yesterday and we were pleased with the outcome. I ordered the grill mixed plate, that was awesome and the other attendants went for the lunch special (a nice selection of dishes to pick and enough food for 2) and the turkish dumplings. The service was very cordial and diligent. The only \"but\" that I could find is that's a little bit pricey but can't compare with other venues on this area. We will definitely will repeat if we're in the mood for some grill meat and that awesome house bread."}
{"text":"The right blend of aroma and taste, awesome food, it's like east meets west..great service and authenticity!"}
{"text":"Usually local community restos are wide in scope in comparing hits and misses.  Anatolia is a hit out of the park. Luckily this restaurant is a 5 minute walk from my place.  Marie F, Steeven and I went for \"linner.\"  A quaint little establishment amongst many brutal places.  There's always a little gem in the community and this is it.  

Their bread is freshly baked and their hummus was very tasty.  I ordered a Mediterranean salad and the Anatolia platter.  This consisted of basmati rice, veggies, meat patties and chicken.  Spices were perfect and the whole dish was succulent.  She was so nice, she  left us each with Turkish delight on the house which is generally a dessert.  

The owner takes pride in her establishment almost like she's your mother.  Always wants feedback in her dishes.  She's very friendly.  So definitely if you're in Etobicoke, stop by here and you will easily be satisfied."}
{"text":"After having been to Byblos, I thought I had had the best. But no, Anatolia is equally good!

The best part about the food was how fresh everything tasted! The spices, the menu, everything was superb. We started out with the Patlican Ezme, which is an eggplant dish and omg! it is a must try! We also had the Meze Tabagi for starters, it has four kinds of spreads and every one of them is awesome. Hummus was the one I tried least, the walnut was the best followed by the tomato salsa spread and eggplant. 

For main course Mr. H and I shared the Yogurtlu Adana. It took us less than 5 minutes to wipe the plate clean. We ended out meal with a cup of Turkish coffee and it was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. 

It's a little far from where I live but I would definitely love to come again!"}
{"text":"Was up in Toronto for a visit, happened to be my mom's bday. We were looking for a not so fancy place, that had great food. She was in the mood for lamb, and being that my gf is Turkish, we wound up at Anatolia. We were all glad we did.
Service was good. I forget the names of the dishes, but we had a spinach & feta pie type item (which wasn't on the menu), we asked for it. Apparently, they didn't even know it wasn't on the menu. I liked it a lot.
Had the mixed grill, all the meats were cooked perfectly. The lamb had a bit of a kick to it, which I liked. 
Mom liked the bread they bought out (which was nice and warm) so much she got the uneaten in a bag to go. 
Overall great experience in a homey place."}
{"text":"I was travelling on business in Ontario and decided to explore the area for dinner instead of doing the easy  but boring activity of eating dinner at my hotel.  Anatolia --- I'm so happy that I found you and that people were spot-on in describing you - what a wonderful little place!  

Anatolia is deserving of its 5-star ratings.  Anatolia is quaint and inviting, and the service is friendly and prompt.  The warm, welcoming ambience is a feature I like when visiting family-owned restaurants versus big-chain franchises.  I was very pleased with my dinner selection -- everything I had was superb.  It was presented nicely (see photos) and tasted fantastic.  I had the mixed veggie plate.  It consisted of an array of food: stuffed artichoke, stuffed grape leaves, white bean salad, and deep-fried phylo-wrapped feta.  Entrees are also served with hummus and freshly baked Turkish \"pide\" bread.  

To end my meal, I had a Turkish coffee served with a morsel of Turkish delight.  The Turkish coffee can be made sweet, medium, or strong.  It is served in a small teacup about the size of a double-shot espresso.  Turkish coffee is thick and contains coffee particles.  You drink the liquid portion as best you can and leave the solids behind, swirling the particles along the side and bottom of your cup.  The waitress said you can supposedly read your fortune, based on the coffee pattern in your cup - kinda like reading tea leaves, I guess.

My business trip did not leave me much time to explore Toronto, but this meal was, by far, the highlight and most enjoyable part of my trip.  On certain nights, Anatolia serves a prix fixe menu and offers live belly dancing performances.  Also, if you ask for one of their take-out menus, there's a 10% off coupon inside the menu.  Anatolia is delightful, and the locals are lucky to have this little treasure in their neighborhood."}
{"text":"Dinner: 3.75/5 overall 
The bad: Service was slow. Pepsi was room temp, so couldn't order it. The coke was flat. Wine/beer selection basic. 

The good: Food was good, service was friendly, and value is great. Ambience is nice. 

What we ordered 
Anatolia Grill (19$): Recommend it if you're going for the grilled dishes. 
Mixed Grill (25$): grilled dishes at Tabule & Bamiyan are just as good. 
Iskander Grill: Recommend it
Mixed Veggie Grill: Thought it was ok. 
Assortment of Appetizers: Recommend it 

There are a number of options (dishes), need to try them all for a fair assessment. Next time we'd skip the mixed and Anatolia Grill dishes and try the other dishes."}
{"text":"I'm always down to try new ethnic food, and this was no exception. Really loved the food here! Ordered the lentil soup which was so delicious, we wished we ordered two! Also had the Meze Tabagi which was a dish of 4 different sauces (hummus included) that you dipped bread into. The mixed plate was also mouth watering. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"came here based on Yelp reviews for a belated birthday dinner, unfortunately we didn't call in advanced so we got the table right by the door, which was really cute but really awkward.

we had a waiter serve us right away and I thought he was just excellent, he was telling us about his Turkish background and explained to us which dishes he recommended the most based on what we said we liked.

We were started with the bread and hummus, the bread was so incredibly soft and fresh, I almost over indulged in it because of this.

Moving along to the eggplant dish (with the white/red sauce on top) I wasn't really a fan since i don't like eggplant but my friend enjoyed this a lot more than i did.  

Moving along to the mains, my lamb was cooked perfectly, and tasted amazing, it was soft, and flavourful - this dish alone will make me return to this place.

My friends veggie platter - they weren't impressed with it, they thought for a main it would have more food, and found the rolls to be a little bland. Thankfully they filled up on the eggplant otherwise they would have been more hangry!

it's a cute little establishment, and comes with a strong recommendation from me!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and the food was delicious. Our waitress was very friendly and cordeal. Upon realizing a mistake on our order, she offered us complimentary meat, coffee and desert. Atmosphere was nice and homey, with some nice touches (i.e arabic instruments  used as decor). The meat was juicy and well spiced. The complimentary bread with hummus was also very good. Would like to come back here again to try their other offerings. A little on the pricier side but well worth it."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Anatolia was about 7 years ago maybe... long time, and it was simply AMAZING!  A group of friends and I went for the Night of Istanbul, when they have prix fix dinner and a night full of entertainment.  The dinner was absolutely delicious, the atmosphere was nice, cozy (as it is not a big restaurant by any means).  The entertainment was then fantastic, they had a lovely live band (duet?) for part of the night and the other part of the night was a bellydancing show.  I was impressed with the dancer, she was beautiful, very skilled, elegant, and fun.  I am a dance aficionado and I enjoy a good bellydancing show.  Having travelled quite a bit and having seen (too) many bellydance shows in my life I could tell this dancer was very good and professional, her name was Maha (or Maya or something like that, we asked as we were considering hiring a bellydancer for a party that year).  

Anyways.  Years pass and we finally got to go again with some friends, we made the reservation for the Night of Istanbul of course hoping for a great entertainment/show like we had had before.  What a disappointment....  the 'dancer' was a far cry from the dancer they used to have...  her outfit looked cheap like something you would expect to see in a beginner student, not in a professional... her dance was no better, no real bellydance moves, no elegance, no quality...  the audience went crazy with her, which was a little surprising until we saw how she kept shaking her cleavage right on men's faces. She also danced -very badly- with a 'sword' that looked like my son's toy swords...  it all just looked crazy and spastic.  I thought maybe she wasn't a real dancer maybe the real dancer couldn't go that night?  but then we found out this was indeed the new dancer...  terrible!   There was no live band that night either...

Veredict:  go for the food!  don't bother for night of Istanbul!"}
{"text":"This was the best restaurant that I have ever been too. WE were treated like guests. The food was delicious and plenty. The waiter brought us lots of free appetizers and desserts. We also had free tea. The service was amazing."}
{"text":"Unfortunately Anatolia does not live up to the reviews listed below. I came here with a few ladies over the weekend and it was overall pretty disappointing. To start, we had Mercimek (lentil soup), lahmachun and hummus with bread. The soup and hummus were great - we loved it. The lahmacun was not worth the price. For mains, we shared a few dishes: iskender, the mixed plate and kebabs. The food was alright and was seasoned well but felt like a rip off when you can get similar dishes down the road at half the cost. The server was average, filled drinks when needed but was terrible at helping us through the menu. Overall, it was okay but chances are we probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"The best Turkish food I've had in north America.  Outside Turkey, few places manage to serve food as good as what you can easily find in Turkey. Iskender and Adana dishes are outstanding, and this is the only place I've found that has Manti (Turkish Ravioli). Anatolia Mixed Plate is a good starting point if you are not familiar with Turkish cuisine.  The service is very friendly."}
{"text":"This restaurant gets a 5 stars from me for the food. My first time here, and my first handful of times partaking in Turkish cuisine, and it was delicious! We started with their traditional bread and homemade hummus. If I could bottle up this hummus and buy it I would. Perfect flavour. Perfect consistency. The bread was very good too, crusty outside, soft inside. We got the beyti and the iskender kebab as our mains. The beef and lamb in both was flavourful and tender. The yogurt in the iskender was so creamy and good. Then we got the baklava for dessert. I've had tons of these from different places and this one held up, very sweet and tasty. Overall, I'm happy to have found this little hidden gem. The 4 stars incorporates the service and the price. Although our waitress was super friendly and happy to help us choose something since it was our first time, she was fairly slow. Overall the restaurant and the meal were both fairly slow. Took a good while to even get water to start. Then the bread, mains, dessert, and bill all took a good long time. And the cost is quite high. Higher than you'd expect I guess."}
{"text":"I had never tasted Turkish cusines until yesterday and I wasn't disappointed. Owner/chef Ayse Aydemir takes a personal approach to creating and serving authentic Turkish dishes and takes pride in getting one-on-one feedback from the patrons.

We began with traditionnal Turkish tea served in small glass-like tea cups and a quick lesson on Turkish tea etiquette (see Marie F's review).

For my appetizer, I ordered the Mediterranean salad, which was a wonderful mix of finely chopped vegetables (a mixture of tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers and sweet onions) in a zesty vinnegrette with olives and feta.

Then it was on to the main course; I ordered the Adana kebab (named after the city in Turkey), which were a spicy mixture of ground beef and lamb over a bed of basmati rice and bulgur. This was served with a side of Domatez Ezmesi (a spicy, fresh blend of finely chopped tomatoes, crisp green peppers, sweet Spanish onions and fresh herbs.) On the whole, a very delicious meal.

Oh and if that weren't enough, the home-made bread with humus, which is sprinkled with paprika and a drizzle of olive oil, it to die for.

Next time I won't stuff myself so much so I can try some of their wonderful deserts (I'm looking at you baklava)."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Turkish Restaurant, nice ambiance, we tried Manti and was amazing. The Kunafa was great too"}
{"text":"I just came here with 5 coworkers - Everyone's food was DELICIOUS. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We ate at this place years ago and remembered how amazing their food was. We decided to go again today and see it if stills holds up to our memories. Sure enough- it was delicious. The warm fresh bread with hummus is great to start with. We had the feta cheese spring roll (not exactly sure of the name) and they were amazing. If you are a feta fan then you have to order this plate. The main course was delicious. The chicken tasted very good, lightly spiced but very flavourful. We also had the beef&lamb kabobs which were also very good. Service is quick! And very friendly!
Hidden gem for sure.
Make sure you try the baklava. Probably one of the best ones I've had"}
{"text":"I was received by the manager who took my order and made sure the dishes I order will be made fresh to order. Because i came in basically almost at the last order before they closed.

He also helped choose a dish by his recommendation.

We picked up Boureq, Manti, and kabab iskandar. All were great and very tasty, certified by my father. Which a hard thumbs up to get.

I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This is a great choice for Turkish cuisine. We are visiting from vancouver and yelp comes through again with a great restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here 30mins before they closed and they still served us. Although when we got there, the guy had us wait aince he was going to chrck if the kitchen is still open. As soon as they said that we are goos to order, we did exactly that. We ordered their appetizer which was an eggplant spread along with their complimentary bread and hummus. The combination of hummus and eggplant was just so addicting that we finished the bread and got another round. I can probably take home more too. Lol. Then for main course, we ordered their feast which included chicken, beef and lamb kebab. It comes with a bed of rice. I only tried their chicken and beef kebab and it was very tender, moist and flavorful. The food was just melting in my mouth. I was so full that I couldn't move anymore. I will definitely be back here when we go to Toronto"}
{"text":"Food was great.
We had Patlican Ezme (Baba Ghanoush) and Anatolia Mixed Plate.
Grilled dish came with rice and salad, portions were good.
The service was wonderful. We went there for a early birthday celebration for my friends. Our waiter over-heard we talked about her birthday, gave us Keskul with candle on house.
Turkish coffee was muddy and strong, it was bitter but with a hint of sweet in it."}
{"text":"We heard about this restaurant from a friend, and were looking for something new to try out.

All the reviews here are spot on, the food was amazing, the atmosphere very authentic. The owners and staff are all Turkish, all very friendly. I'm no expert on Turkish food, but we tried to order more traditional dishes and everything we had was delicious."}
{"text":"Wonderful, tasty home cooked Turkish food. Very warm cozy setting is made even warmer by friendly servers! The mixed plate with Kofta, a chicken and a lamb skewer was cooked perfectly and served piping hot. As simple as it was, even the rice was amazingly tasty! I'd go back in a heartbeat!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a meal! It was our first time at Anatolia and I only wish we discovered this place sooner.

We went on a Sunday night and the place was about half full. It seemed like most patrons were regulars. We were greeted quickly but then were shuffled to several tables so we could pick our own seat. It was a little awkward.

We started with the feta and hummus appetizer. It was some of the best, freshest feta I've ever had.

We then shared the massive meat (kebab) platter. All of the meat was piping hot and cooked to perfection. It was served on barley and basmati rice and had two amazing dipping sauces.

Anatolia we will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Unsure how this place got so many positive reviews. We just had dinner there and the service was abysmal. Spent about 100$ on food that was seriously lacking in salt and we got one glass of water for the whole time we were there. I even asked for some more water towards the end and still received none. Very disappointing service and the food is ok nothing that warrants the price point. I will say however the hummus was delicious but that's about it."}
{"text":"Seriously the best service we had in a long time!  We went there with our newborn baby, 7 year old daughter and our in-laws.  The atmosphere was very nice.  The food is amazing. Even our picky daughter couldn't stop eating.  Portions are very big so you can take some to go.  I definitely recommend the place!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Sat at 8pm made reservations for 2. We were promptly seated, bit it took 30 min before they took our order. The 40 seat restaurant was full. Decor is eclectic, and felt comfortable. The only Turkish beer they had was Lefe, they ran out of beer glasses though so I drank out of the can. The Sheppard's salad is just a regular salad and was $10. My date ordered the Beyti which was good, but not worth the price. I had the Ali which was lamb and eggplant. It tasted amazing portion was generous. Total was $67 for 2 mains, 1 app and 1 drink."}
{"text":"My first ever run-in with Turkish cuisine was when I was in Grade 4 in Mr. Wills' homeroom class.  He was my English teacher and we had read C.S. Lewis' The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.  After we finished reading the book, Mr. Wills bought Cadbury's Turkish Delight in for the class as we all were wondering what heavenly deliciousness could make a brother betray his own blood?  Well, I later found out that it was nothing but a pinkish looking jujube-like candy covered in chocolate.  I guess you can't really consider that to be a sampling of any culture's cuisine.

While exchanging emails with my mom about how all the good bakeries in Scarborough reside along Kingston Road, she must've stumbled upon a connected link to other bakeries which led her to Ma Maison, which was inconveniently located at the polar opposite end of the Scarborough bakeries I was referring he to - Ma Maison was in Etobicoke.  Since my mother wanted to try their croissants, and since I was going to be in Etobicoke anyways, I decided to go outside my comfort \"zone\" (literally), and try Turkish cuisine.  Yelp has always brought me to new and exciting restaurants that I would otherwise not discover or even think about trying... Anatolia fell right into that category.

I arrived at approximately 5:45PM on a Wednesday to an empty restaurant.  There were about 5 tables at the peak (while I was there).  There were 2 servers.  The decor was traditional with lots of Turkish chinaware lining the walls and tapestries.  Red-and-white-checkered table cloths were laid across the table.  

Being inexperienced, other than having read reviews about the Mixed Plate being good, we asked the server for her recommendations for an appetizer.  None of us were particularly hungry, so we just got one mixed plate and ended up opting for the quartet of dips/spreads.  This is also the first time I've been to a restaurant where I was uncomfortable trying to pronounce the names of the dishes in fear of sounding like an idiot, haha.  So I just said, I'll take a number 16 and a number 35.  I bet I challenged the server's memory! 

Meze Tabagi-  Four of Anatolia's most popular spreads including: Ayse's Walnut Spread, Hummus, Salsa and Eggplant.  Other than the walnut spread, I found the other 3 spreads to be rather bland and unflavourful.  I will say though that all the spreads tasted fresh.  The bread that came with the dips was different than western breads.  It almost reminded me of eating a water biscuit as it was quite simple in terms of flavour, but I wouldn't use the word bland to describe it.    

Anatolia Mixed Plate - Came with 1 grilled chicken kebab, flame broiled beef kofte, lahmacun (a crepe-pita hybrid filled with ground beef, and various Turkish spices), bulgur rice and a rice pilaf.  The grilled chicken was quite tender, juicy and succulent and the yogurt dip was rich and creamy.  The beef kofte's had a nice char to them and were also quite flavourful.  I loved the rice pilaf that was cooked in a chicken broth but the winner of this mixed plate had to be the lahmacun.  The lahmacun was wrapped into a cigar shape, and had so many different layers of flavours that just came together to create a tasty, tasty \"crepe.\"

To end the night off, I tried a Turkish Coffee.  It took about 15 minutes from the time I ordered it to show up on the table.  Turkish Coffee comes in an espresso cup and a piece of Turkish delight.  I had originally ordered it strong and sugarless (I was thinking Starbucks coffee) but when the server gave quipped \"Are you sure?\" I took her recommendation and went with medium instead.  It was later revealed to me that Turkish coffee is quite strong.  I guess that's why you need the Turkish delight as an accompaniment.  Turkish Coffee in my own words, tastes rather \"woody.\"  It does not possess a particularly strong caffeine flavour to it, but is unique in its own right.  Just a heads up that there will be coffee grinds at the bottom of your cup, try to avoid drinking that!  The Turkish delight was a lot better than the Cadbury version that I had back in primary school, and had nuts in it.  

Verdict:

I must reward top marks when it came to plating and presentation.  Everything was so visually appealing, not to mention savoury.  The Mixed Plate is definitely a must try as all the proteins were juicy, succulent and tender with a nice char/grilled flavour to it and the rices were flavourful as well.  The bill fell shy of $50 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"I don't know what \"real\" Turkish food is supposed to taste like, but I know that the meal that I had tonight was delicious.  I had stumbled onto this Yelp all-star a couple months ago and had driven all the way to Etobicoke only to realize that Anatolia is closed on Mondays.  Of course, this only made me want to try it even more so here I was on a rainy night driving a half hour from my hotel to get some Turkish food.  Luckily, the restaurant was not busy because parking can be a real challenge in this area and my fellow Yelpers have suggested to make reservations.

The servers - and someone that I assume was the owner - both were extremely friendly and accommodating to every guest that braved the elements.  

My server suggested trying the mixed grill - a combination of beef, chicken, and lamb kebabs along with kofte (a beef patty) and Adana (a spicy (but not really spicy) blend of beef and lamb that is grilled on a skewer).  The dish is finished off with rice, bulger, and a salad.  A yogurt sauce and a salsa like sauce round out the plate.  The entire platter comes covered in yufka - sort of like tortillas.  

I honestly could not decide which part of the plate was my favorite because it was all so good.  The marinades provided just the right hint of flavor without overpowering the meal, the meat was cooked fully but still juicy, the platter came out consistently and appropriately hot and cold across every component - not an easy feat with a mixed platter like I ordered.  

I strongly suggest the mixed grill for the variety of flavors you receive.  They are able to scale this dish for multiple people which is a nice and economical alternative.  

I am so busy talking about the entree that I almost forgot about the complimentary pide bread and hummus that is provided to every table.  I very well could have made a meal just on that alone - I would hold off on ordering an appetizer just so you have plenty of room for the pide. 

Although I am not a coffee guy - I did take advantage of the yelp check in offer for free Turkish coffee and it was also good.

Is Anatolia the best Turkish food in Toronto?  Is it better than you can get in Istanbul?  I don't know, I don't care and you shouldn't either.  Don't let the idea of going to a Turkish restaurant get in the way of getting to this restaurant - it is just plain great food paired with great service.  You won't be disappointed (expect if you don't make reservations)."}
{"text":"Oh wow. Turkish Delight is right. Came here because I was searching for something near my friend's work.  Right at the corner of Kipling and Dundas, this hidden gem was a place you have to try.  5 stars all the way, and it lived up to it's Yelp reviews. 

The place's interior is wooden, with traditional decor and really feels like it takes you away to another world.  The server was super friendly and even tried to offer us something we could eat, as we both missed out on the seemingly awesome pita due to wheat intolerance. 

We ordered the grilled calamari that came with hummus and soaked in a bed of sun dried tomatoes. It had to be the best calamari I've ever tasted - rubbery, but not tough, and full of flavour

My friend and I shared the Mixed Grill Plate. Unfortunately due to dietary restrictions we asked to omit the Turkish Pita and some wheat flakes.  But it was still really good. 
Lamb Kebob, Lamb minced, beef kebob and chicken kebob on a bed of rice, sides of tahini, tomato salsa type thing, carrots, red cagge and regular salad. 
The lamb was very flavourful and the chicken was surprisingly moist and soft (i usually hate white meat, but this one some how melted in the mouth). $19.95

We also got the turkish coffee, which they brew from scratch, any sugar or cream is boiled with it. It comes on a tray in a espresso like tea cup.  The coffee was amazing. Not as bold as espresso, lighter in texture and full of flavour.  It comes with a Turkish Delight jelly thing. $3.95

I want to come here again. 5 stars. 

They have parking in the front, and Green P parking in the back."}
{"text":"Manti was the best I've had since visiting Turkey. Wish I lived closer so I could dine here more often. I will definitely come back if my travels bring me back to Toronto."}
{"text":"This restaurant made me fall in love with Turkish food. Order the gozleme as an appetizer it's a thin dough with cheese and onions. So good! The mezze dips are yummy I love the walnut spread. Adana kebabs or the beyti are also must order items. I even love the rice they serve with most dishes and I'm not a fan of rice. It is a little expensive but the quality is there. Also don't forget to make reservations on the weekends you can't just walk in and expect a table we've been turned away a couple of times."}
{"text":"The food tastes homemade and both lamb and chicken were fresh and delicious. I will definitely go there again and try the grill dishes. Also try their Turkish coffee if you like!"}
{"text":"Very delicious food! We ordered the lamb and chicken shish kebab dinner, sigara boregi and tea. The food came out fresh and flavourful and the service was very friendly. I didn't like the sigara because it was kind of bland and needed some more filling. The only major thing I have to complain about is the price, although it was good, I don't think it was worth $80 for 2 people"}
{"text":"This restaurant is delicious!!!!!!!! My husband and I went here on a Saturday night and got there around 615 the owner was really nice and said that there wasn't room since we didn't have reservations and then asked us if we think we might be done before 730 and we said yes definitely so he was nice enough to let us in and get us a seat. I got the Adana kebab and my husband got the Iskandar kebab which were both really delicious. They give you really delicious bread and hummus to begin with but I was a bit disappointed that my meal didn't come with rice or bread but couscous instead. The food was really really delicious but I literally finished every single thing on my plate and that usually never happens. For 20 bucks it was definitely worth it but it was a little on the pricey side. 

My husband's meal was also delicious and his head pieces of bread underneath the meat that were chopped up I still wish his at least came with a salad and some rice or bread the way mine came with the salad but still miss the rice for the bread because that would have definitely made a lot more feeling. I will definitely come back here one day but I felt as though it was a little too pricey for two people $55+! 

Loved it and will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed dining here.  It's such a hidden gem.  Was just walking by the area when I peeked inside to see a beautifully decorated restaurant.  I decided to visit another day, and boy, I was so happy.  The owner was very friendly.  All smiles from her and very helpful in explaining the menu.  My friend and I were seated on the table close by the front window, which was adorned by beautiful Turkish throw pillows/rug.  The table itself was stunning as it was made out of a real tree.  Five stars for ambiance.  The food was also amazing.  To start, we had hummus and bread.  For the entree, I  had the manti, which were the mini dumplings.  I ate all of it to the last drop, when I realized after the meal, and while perusing their website, that the dressing is made out of butter, yikes! No wonder it was good (and calorie-laden)... Oops.  Anyway, my friend had the mixed grill, and I tasted it as well. It was not too spicy and not too bland.  It was just right.  I do prefer my  kabobs and kofte on the spicy/ Pakistani style usually, but, I did enjoy the medley of flavours here."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Very tasty food although many things from menu made from same ground beef and fancy Middle East name chosen to give the impression of variety when a different sauce or presentation  added. Overall is a very good place to enjoy your dinner. I would come again"}
{"text":"We had brunch at the breakfast café, a couple doors down from Anatolia's main restaurant. We ordered the golem (spinach and feta filled grilled flaky crepes) and the mezes platter, which came with 3 types of dip and a bread basket. Everything arrived quickly and freshly made. The portions were surprisingly big considering the price point. We are hearty eaters and we could not finish. The food tasted amazing, but their bread and the eggplant dip were out of this world. We also got Turkish coffee and Turkish delight at the end of the meal, complimental of the chef. The decor inside is cheery and inviting, with checkered tablecloths and fresh flowers at the table. All in all a delightful experience with some of the best value for truly divine Turkish food and we will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Good ambiance but super slow service. Ordered 2 app and 2 main courses without any drinks it was $73 check. Manti and lahmacun was not good. Eggplant and yaprak dolma were fresh."}
{"text":"Delicious food and warm customer service! Loved this place and will definitely be back. The quality and taste of food is top grade. And the best place to have delicious vegetarian and eggplant dishes!"}
{"text":"Came here for a wonderful Saturday lunch and I honestly don't know what could have made it better! I started my meal with hummus on the most wonderful pita, followed it up by lamb served served in a savory crepe-like pastry and finished with Turkish coffee.

The service was incredibly friendly and welcoming. It was very apparent that the lady who runs the restaurant takes great pride in the food...rightfully so. I strongly recommend the venture out to try this place out.

Apparently the first Friday of everything they throw a Turkish party with a pre-fix menu...I'm pumped to try it out!"}
{"text":"Visiting from California and found this place on Yelp.  The hostess (presumably owner) was very friendly and even gave us free Baklava."}
{"text":"Located at an Etobicoke stripmall just east of the Kipling to Bloor/Dundas fork, Anatolia was easy to find. Approach slowly, however, as you may miss the entrance to the lot! The parking is limited up front, and many of the vacant spots have signs reserving the parking for only customers of specific stores at the plaza. Coincidentally, we were able to find an unrestricted parking spot in front of another Turkish establishment in the plaza, specializing in coffee and dessert.

Anatolia is quaintly decorated, and we were lucky to be seated at the street-facing table for two by the front window, which was lit plentifully with natural light. Having not had much exposure to Turkish cuisine before, our server graciously provided us with recommendations on what she felt her restaurant did best. 

Of her recommendations, we ended up ordering the manti (mini dumplings filled with seasoned ground beef and topped with garlicky yogurt, mint, hot, golden butter and paprika - $18) and the mixed plate (grilled chicken shish kebab, flame broiled Izkara kofte, lahmacun - $23). We also added an order of patlican kizartmasi (fried eggplant served with garlicky yogurt and a light tomato sauce - $12) to start.

My best description for the eggplant dish would be that it was similar to an eggplant parmesan but using much thicker cuts of eggplant and omitting the breading. The garlicky yogurt taste was what gave it distinction. I enjoyed this dish but think its more suited for sharing between 3-5 people.

The mixed plate contained flavours I was more accustomed to from other Mediterranean cuisines. Of this plate, the chicken was the real standout. It was perfectly prepared, and I can't think of a word superlative enough to describe its tenderness. The kofte and lahmacun were also very good, but the chicken is an item that would get me to make a repeat visit.

Our Manti dumplings came last, and we were both taken aback by how beautifully plated of a dish it was with its vibrant greens, reds, and yellows. After snapping a couple pictures we mixed  everything up and tried the dumplings for the first time. Compared to its relatives from other cuisines (ex. perogies, Chinese dumplings), I think these definitely had much more complex flavours. The dumplings were densely packed and had almost a gnocchi-like consistency. Very addicting, but another dish that I thought would be better for sharing between a larger number of people.

Prior to dinner, we had decided that depending on how we felt about the restaurant, we would get baklava from Anatolia or the other Turkish establishment we parked in front of. However, upon viewing the dessert menu we quickly changed course and ended up getting two black Turkish coffees and keskul (light creamy milk pudding, infused with crushed almonds, shredded coconuts, vanilla and lemon zest - $7) to share.

The keskul was reminiscent of almond rice milk puddings I had in my childhood, and thus I really enjoyed it. As described, it was very light and wasn't too sweet. It paired perfectly with our Turkish coffee, which was very dark.

Overall, I have absolutely no complaints about Anatolia, and will definitely be making a return visit, hopefully in the near future. There are so many dishes that I want to try. If you're into doing family-style meals with a larger group, I'd highly recommend this place as the servings seemed to be perfect for groups of 3-5, and potentially even larger! As of this writing, this place is my recommendation for a taste of Turkey in the GTA. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner
Specialty: Turkish cuisine
Menu items: Pide Bread, Sigara Boregi, Yogurtlu Adana & Anatolia Mixed Plate

Anatolia is my own Turkish delight. People often ask me where I go for comfort food and I always tend to default to my good old Cafe Polonez or my Mexican hideout in Kensington market. Now that I have experienced Anatolia to its fullest, I can say with delight (pun intended) that this cute and little spot in Etobicoke will be joining my list of comfort food restaurants.

The first comfort I get when I arrive at Anatolia is knowing that I will be greeted by a pleasant group of waitresses that will be bring me a delicious loaf of the famous Pide Bread. The bread is buttery, crunchy on the outside and soft in the centre. Accompanied by a small serving of hummus for dipping; this bread might make or break your meal if you do not watch how much of it you eat. Been there, done that. 

Anatolia is the name given to the region of the Westernmost part of Asia, comprising the majority of the Republic of Turkey. Influenced by a fusion of Middle Eastern, Central Asian and Balkan cuisines (Greece being one of the strongest); Anatolian cuisine is best known for its use of breads and pastas in its meals. One of the better examples of Greek influence you will find in Turkish cuisine is the use of phyllo style pastries; the Sigara Boregi is a clear representation and comfort food #2 in my books.
Also known as Yufka pastry, Sigara Boregi is filled with a lovely mixture of feta cheese and parsley. With a resemblance to Greece's own Spanakopita, this pastry appetizer reminds me that sometimes less is more, and in this case, simple is just tastier.

Comfort food #3 and the ultimate tomato sauce style dish I indulge in is the Yogurtlu Adana.
Once the dish arrives, the first thought that comes to mind is comfort indeed; the second thought is that the balance of red (aka tomato sauce) on the dish is a bit off-putting. However, once you take a fork, cut a bit of the spiced mix of lamb and beef, dig through the meat straight into the sauce and buttery pide bread underneath, grab-hold of all that tender and soft juiciness that you are about to put in your mouth and eat it; you will realize how special and yummy this dish is, and how much more of the sauce you want to have. 
Let's talk about the sauce for a moment...this tomato sauce is one of the lightest, tastiest and balanced tomato sauces I have ever had the pleasure to try. You can clearly distinguish this was made with fresh tomatoes and that the chef took its time with the sauce. 

Last comfort food delight is the Anatolia Mixed Plate.
The plate needs some explanation as it's a compilation of the most popular Turkish dishes offered at Anatolia, in one big plate. This hearty meal comes with grilled chicken shish kebab, flame broiled Izgara Kofte (aka Turkish meatballs), Lahmacun (a thin pita topped with a fine layer of spiced ground beef and herbs), rice pilav, Bulgur (middle eastern grain made out of wheat cereals) and salad. A mouth-watering indulgence and a great dish for the hungry.

Until our next comfort food delight Foodies!

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with friends. We all enjoyed every single thing we had, from appetizers to main courses, to dessert. Two of us had the shrimp saute with cheese baked on top and it was fantastic. The shrimp were cooked just right. My husband had the mixed grill and loved it. The coffee was, well, different. Very good, and different. The servers were very friendly and answered any questions we had. A great experience.  We all agreed we will go there again."}
{"text":"It was nice of them to accommodate us on a Saturday evening without reservation. To be honest we made the decision last moment after checking Yelp reviews. So just be aware, make reservation ahead of time. The joint is a nice humble place with decent seating and amicable atmosphere. It was quite crowded though. Ok now about the food, it took quite long for them to bring out the mains after appetizer, I guess around 30 mins. While the grilled calamari was really good, the Anatolia mixed grill and Beyti failed to inspire. I may visit the place again if my frnds insist :)"}
{"text":"The most amazing food. It was quite the treat. We were also given some bread and humus to start which was nice. Definately would come back. Nice and friendly service. 

I ordered the Ali Nazik (chicken)."}
{"text":"We were at Six Points (lunch time Sunday) wondering where to eat; thanks to Yelp for the suggestions. We haven't tried Turkish food yet so we chose Anatolia Restaurant. 

What a cozy restaurant with lots of personality and relaxing guitar music in the background. We had the sweetest waitress who explained the menu to us; she had a warm smile and a sunny disposition. 

After I read the story in the menu about the Priest fainting after eating the Imam Bayidi (\"Whether it was from the sheer deliciousness or the exorbitant cost of the dish are all speculation\"- from menu), I knew I had to order it. Hubby decided on the Anatolia Mixed Plate. We also wanted to try the ayran drink and Turkish coffee.

Complimentary homemade Turkish bread and hummus - decent and very filling 4/5

Imam Bayidi (oven baked baby eggplant filled with sauteed onions and tomatoes) - very peppery. We actually enjoyed eating it as a side with the mixed plate. 4/5

Anatolia Mixed Plate
Chicken Shish Kabob was delicious but it became more dry as we got near the end. 4/5

Flamed Broiled Izgara Kofte (seasoned beef patties) was my favorite: juicy and flavorful 5/5

Lahmacun was tasty but a bit dry 3/5

Side salad was bland but we dipped it in the garlic yogurt dip and it was perfect 4/5

The rice was a little oily 3/5

Aryan drink (thick savory yogurt drink) was not my thing. If your insides were on fire from eating something spicy, the owner guarantees it'll put the fire out and cool you down. I have no doubt since it coats everything it touches 2/5

Turkish coffee - very potent and it tastes like they use treated tap water. 2/5

All in all, we had a wonderful time trying out Turkish food. Everything went well together and the blend of spices were harmonious and well balanced. The owner, Ayse, is a lovely lady who takes pride in her restaurant and makes sure all her customers are well taken care of."}
{"text":"Located in Etobicoke Anatolia focuses on traditional Turkish cuisine!
The only issue with this place is parking is right off the street so it can be quite challenging.  The ambiance is cutely put together highlighting the cultural attribute of the country. 
The service it was excellent, friendly and efficient as each time a dish came out they would provide us an explanation of what they were serving and even recommended what to pair it with. 
As for food we ordered a few ranges after taking some recommendation from our server.

For appetizer the Meze Tebagi, an assortment of appetizers featuring humus, spicy humus, babaganoush, walnut spread served with pita.  Beautifully decorated and the flavors were bang-on delicious.

For mains we shared the Anatolia Mix platter, which was an assortment of meats served with potatoes and rice.

Dessert we tried their Keshkul, a milk like pudding with pistachios along with Turkish coffee.

Overall this place had all the things I wanted.  Flavor, service, presentation and it was reasonable. I'll definitely be back soon when I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place has the best Turkish food in the GTA, and we come here once in a while for lunch or dinner -- if you're only two people, you can almost always get a table without reservations. On weekends they tend to have large celebrating groups and get too loud for a date night.
The Meze Tabagi appetizer plate (four appetizer spreads) is a must, so you might want to just split one entree after that, unless you're big eaters. One of the items on that plate, a walnut spread, is very special and memorable. The chicken kebabs and beef kebabs are both well marinated, succulent, and made with great quality meat. The kofte, however, made from ground meat (beef and lamb) are quite bland and made with moderate-quality meat, and I wouldn't recommend. Don't get the shrimp dish, either (why are you coming to a Turkish restaurant to get sauteed shrimp anyway?). I'm taking a star down for these (very few) missed dishes and also for the fact that their wines by the glass are so-so."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with colleagues from work. The food was excellent and the owner was really helpful with suggestions for food.  We had the stuffed eggplant, the fried cheese, dumplings, shrimp and mixed grill. The Turkish coffee was very good and I'm not a coffee drinker. It went really well with the Baklava. The owner was fantastic and even taught us how to read our fortune with the coffee grinds from the Turkish coffee. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located nowhere near me but I would go back.  It's located in a tiny tiny strip plaza (super limited parking....maybe park in the plaza lot next door??).   It's Turkish food done well.  The décor isn't Turkish but the food and the service (hospitality) is definitely Turkish..

First off our reservation changed from 8 people to 10..;no problem at all.  Then as there were 2 kids they asked if we needed anything for the kids and then asked if we could sit them on the inside because the servers would be coming out with hot plates and didn't want to spill anything on them,  Nice!

We ordered the large mixed appetizer (hummus, a tomato spread, and a walnut spread -YUM).  They gave us extra warm bread when we asked for it at our table.  

I had the lamb and beef kebobs (Adana kebabs) and they were a delicious spicy mix of yum!  I devoured these.  I'm still thinking about these skewers today.  The skewers packed so much flavour in them I was impressed.  You get 2 fairly decent sized kebabs along with salad and bulger.   I'd definitely order this again.

The menu is split into hot and cold appetizers, grills and traditional food.  Ask the server for suggestions or explanations of anything - they are more than willing to explain

Check in on yelp and get a free Turkish coffee :)"}
{"text":"This place is soooo GOOD!  The food quality is SUPERB. I've been here twice and both times I have been blown away. I can't wait to go back and try other things. It's a family run, fine dining experience.   I highly recommend making reservations as we had done. There wasn't a single empty seat in the house both times we went. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Tucked inside a run down plaza in a really confusing part of town is where you will find this gem. There's an amazing vibe from the moment you walk into this place. You just know it's going to be a great experience.

Right from the get go starting with the baba ganoush (eggplant spread) to the fresh salads and into the main course of meats and rice; it all just screams deliciousness. Somehow, despite whatever it is you decide to order everything ends up cohesive and tastes harmonious together. It's rare to witness such visual, textual and flavour experience all combined and delivered in such an authentic vessel. You will walk away feeling good knowing that your culinary wisdom has just gone up a slight notch today.

This place is absolutely not to be missed."}
{"text":"A group of us came here for an early dinner after the Village of Islington Murals tour.
The inside of the restaurant has a notable touch to it with it's decor, design and color scheme, such as this light blue paint on the beams and wooden borders on some of the structures. Our group ended up splitting into two tables of about eight people each.
There are also two areas of the restaurant that creates a visual illusion if the diner is observant enough. One is the mirror behind the bar which gives the impression that the restaurant is more extended into the back of the building and a second was where we sat, it was this square wooden structure with a hollow gap which made me feel that there was a mirror inside until I looked careful and realized that the image I was looking at was actually the way into the kitchen area. Very neat trick to the eye :-)

The most impressive food that I had during our time here was the complimentary Turkish bread which came with a small ramekin of hummus. It had a distinct look to it. Wow! The bread which was cut into biscotti thick slices already looked so fresh and toasty when it was brought to our tables and the crust has this look of golden delicious cornbread. Each slice was warm and so soft and the buttery colored hummus tasted so good when dabbed on the bread. One member at our table only wanted to try one slice, and after finishing the first one, I believe she had three more. Out of the eight of us sitting at our table, the four people at my end of the table finished up our basket until only one slice was left. I brought home that slice with a portion of my dish. That was how tasty Antolia's bread was! The four other table-members probably wanted to save room for their food so their bread was only sampled, and what was left of it was taken home by someone who sat beside me.

The people at the other table being more adventured order a bunch of tasty looking appetizers including a Meze Tabagi (four different dips), a Imam Bayildi (baked stuffed eggplant) and a very thin rolled up fried savory appetizer (Sigara Boregi). All of them looked tempting.

For my meal I already had my mind set on the Adana Kebab and the two pieces of oblong shaped slow grilled mixture of beef and lamb came served on a bed of butter infused rice with a side of fresh green making up a salad.
The other plates at our table including the Anatolia Mixed Plate, a Shrimp Saute with Rice and also another mixed kebab plate were impressive. The mixed plates came accompanied with this crepe-thin naan bread. I've seen a variety of naan-style bread in my life time but the crepe-like naans were something new to me and so was the style of the bread that we had at the beginning. Everything was just impressive.

After some thought I decided to order a Turkish coffee for the experience and so did someone at the other table. The two small cups were delivered on a golden swing like contraption. I've been told that Turkish coffee can be strong but I'm so used to enjoying my coffee that I think I was resistant to the strength of the taste. But I did like mine which was medium sweet and just right.

The food at this place hit the spot and I would like to try out their manti the appetizers next time and I would definitely enjoy another basket of that lovely bread :-)"}
{"text":"Stuck in a neglected corner of the city, north of where the subway ends (or where it starts, I suppose, depending on your perspective), is this little gem of a place with food that will linger on your palate long after the meal.

My wife found it through serendipity more than anything. It was 8 pm on a Saturday in late September, and we were hungry. The place was packed. For very good reason, as it turned out.

She ordered a bowl of lentil soup and an assortment of appetizers - patlican ezme (babaghanoush), hummus, a delicious, fresh-tasting tomato salsa (or at least that's how it tasted) and the winner of the evening, a walnut spread that immediately made it onto our list of our favourite dishes in the city.

I had the Imam bayildi tabagi, eggplant roasted so that it was supple, and yet firm enough to hold a fabulous mixture of sautéed onions, tomatoes, garlic, parsley and peppers. The dish comes with two half-eggplants, rice or bulgur, and a side salad. It's all fresh and lovely and delicious.

Notwithstanding, you'll want to save room for dessert. The baklava has so much butter in its flaky pastry that it makes you wonder if there's such a thing as too much butter. If the answer is yes, and this is how good it tastes, then I'm ok with it.

My wife went with Noah's Pudding, a heavenly concoction of barley, legumes, dried fruits, and nuts. The server warns us that it's made from scratch, and takes about 15 minutes to prepare and cook. Again, well worth the wait.

The gracious owner stops by after we've already ordered our dessert to offer more of it on the house. We decline politely, and she insists, then brings us a takeout box so we can carry it home with us. When we also decline the Turkish coffee because of concerns over the caffeine at that hour, she presents a voucher for a free one on our next visit.

The table next to us is populated by a group of gregarious Libyan men who've driven in from Hamilton, and continually offer to share their food, which is so plentiful their table is groaning under its weight. They inform us that this type of meal is more enjoyable when it's part of a social experience, which pretty much sums up the whole evening."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, good service, most importantly amazing authentic food!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that this was the first time I have ever tried Turkish food, so even if this is the worst Turkish place in Toronto, well, they still managed to win me over. We Stumbled upon Anatolia Restarant last night when I mixed hunger and taking Dundas St W home and we somehow ended up pulling into this place. The restaurant itself is decorated pretty nicely, the tables all had table cloths on them, the walls were decorated, and the staff was friendly and helpful. I didn't have any idea what to expect before looking at the menu but it was filled with tons of different dishes from vegetarian options, eggplant, beef, chicken, and a long list of kebob's to choose from. I ended up going with the \"Izgara Kofte\" which was a traditional Turkish dish consisting of small flame broiled beef patties served with rice and a salad. The meat was tender, juicy, and delicious and the rice was actually some of the best I've had in recent memory. Sadly, I'm not a huge dressing fan so my girlfriend got to enjoy the salad for breakfast today. Overall, This was a great way to dive into Turkish cuisine and they have left me craving more. I highly suggest people give this place a shot if they are interested in giving Turkish food a try!"}
{"text":"I came here to grab some middle eastern food. Have not had Turkish food in Canada ever so this was my first time. I got the mixed plate for 2 people and sharded among three people which was enough. The food was good and the place was nice. The service was amazing. Over all like the place just it is far from where I live not sure if I will have the chance to try it again."}
{"text":"Great food, the waitress was pretty nice and helpfull, so she got a nice tip!
Is the closest to the real mediterranean food that I have tryed on North America so I reccomend to everyone this place!"}
{"text":"Small little gem. Great service. And authentic decor. Now to the main stuff...the kabab platter for 4 had decent portion. Lamb, beef, chicken was all cooked perfectly. The beyti dish reminded me of a tortellini pasta but with a Turkish kick. Fresh bread with hummus to start. Fresh green salad to accompany the meat. And good attentive service by the owner too. Will definitely be visiting again and again."}
{"text":"This was our first trial of Turkish food.  We came expecting food similar to Greek food. Were we so wrong! Though Turkish and Greek food both use yogurt and kebab, the food was marinated and cooked rather differently.  

We started with a large meze tabagi appetizer.  The bread that came with the dips was very soft and warm.  I was sure they made the bread in house.  The 4 dips were all stars in their own right.  They were chicken peas hummus, minty walnut spread (our favourite), domates ezmesi which was similar to a spicy and well grounded salsa, and eggplant patlican salata.  

For entrees, we ordered the Mixed Grills and the Anatolia Mixed Plate, both of which served meat kebabs.  While Greek kebabs were solid meat chunks on sticks, Turkish kebabs, or at least the Anatolia version of kebabs, are small chunks of grounded lean meat on sticks.  The result was well marinated and tender meat chunks on sticks.  Each type of meat (chicken, beef, lamb) was marinated with special sauce and herbs, had individual personality, and no one really outshone the other.  Some might find the kebabs on the salty side; they were delicious nevertheless.  Both entrees came with salad and rice.  

The plates were large in portion.  The four of us split 3 dishes and were all full.  

A special note is that Yelper should consider \"Checking In\" on the Yelp App to get a Turkish coffee for free."}
{"text":"The food is very fresh and tasty, the portions are generous. They also serve free Turkish tea which I loved. The best Turkish food I ever had in GTA. Will go again."}
{"text":"I would love to give you a better review but your front of house is absolutely Dreadful and is a complete mismatch from the quality of food you're serving."}
{"text":"Anatolia offers great Turkish food, very authentic well spiced and plenty of choices. The staff are well trained, knows their menu very well and very patient to explain everything."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience!
Replay bad customer service, I didn't get to try the food because after they ask me to move from one table to another table, I decided not to take any more risk and left the restaurant."}
{"text":"After all the glowing reviews I'd have loved to also give this place one, but I am afraid I cannot.

Not that it is bad.  The food was quite tasty, very well prepared and nicely presented.  But the seasoning and value just don't live up to Turkish food in my former hometown.

I had eggplant salad which I thought was going to be more of a chopped dish.  It really was eggplant caviar.  The flavour was very good and nicely smokey (evidently the eggplant was broiled or grilled) but it did not distinguish itself that much from elsewhere.  My partner's appetizer was a sort of pizza of minced meat on thin bread.  Tasty, but the flavour was overwhelmed by too much cumin.  I had the sirloin strips with potatoes as a main dish.  The meat was good if a bit overcooked.  The best part was the grilled eggplant and zucchini skewer that went with it.  It was very artistically presented however.  My partner's chicken kebab was tasty but rather ordinary.  The spongy Turkish bread was much more enjoyable than pita, but they did not refill it.  Tea was served Western style rather than in a glass cup with sugar cubes (not sure if the latter is used in Turkey or is strictly Persian).

Decor is pleasant, with lovely Turkish ceramics.  Service was friendly but not especially outstanding.

We thought the prices were too high for the portion sizes and the ingredients.

I'd recommend it for someone looking for a Turkish food fix and it seems like a nice enough place to bring a date, but I just cannot wax as enthusiastically about it as the other reviewers.

Also, if they had a bar I did not see one.  It would have been nice to have some raki after dinner."}
{"text":"We ordered 8 dishes and each was good.  I was impressed with the variety of flavours.  Highlights were the mixed grill (a bit pricy but very good), cold eggplant app., and grilled calamari (best ever!)."}
{"text":"My experience here was relatively pleasant. Staff was very friendly. Food was delicious, I ordered Adana kabab. The portion was a bit small for the price of the plate but would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a clean, authentic turkish cuisine."}
{"text":"First, if you are not familiar with the neighbourhood, call ahead and ask about parking as it's very limited.  There is a parking lot behind St. James Gate though.

We made sure to come on the last Friday of the month as they do \"A Night of Istanbul\" with live Turkish music, belly dancing, fortune telling, etc.  We got lucky and scored a parking spot right in front of the restaurant.  With some time to spare prior to our reservation, we decided to stop into a Miss Natalie's (two doors down).  We were not even two steps away when someone from Anatolia (not politely) came running out, telling us to move the car but my friend explained the situation.

Anyway, it's a small, beautiful restaurant with a great vibe! A lot of the main courses were lamb, which I don't care for, so I ordered the Izgara Kofte (grilled ground beef patties).  My friends each ordered the Adana Kebab and Chicken Shish Kebab.  We also ordered the hummus appetizer to share.  While we were waiting for the appetizer, this delicious, homemade, hot out of the oven bread came out with a little ramekin of complementary hummus.  It, and the hummus, were out of this world; I would have only ate that for dinner if I was given the choice.  We were kind of holding off on eating the bread as we were waiting for the hummus but, next thing you know, the main courses arrived - they forgot about the hummus ... so unfortunate as it was the best hummus I ever ate in my life!  No word of a lie!  It was not your typical thick hummus but a little thinner, with more spice and garlic.

My friends really liked their dinners but mine was a little on the bland side.  The savior was this garlicy, yogurt condiment and some other hot, spicy, Turkish style salsa. I can't begin to explain the flavours of these condiments - nothing like I've eaten before.  Just delicious and top quality ingredients.

OK so the night was progressing and we were on dessert but still no Night of Istanbul ... we left shortly after 9pm and it the entertainment still didn't start.

I will definitely, 100% return but I have to deduct a star for the parking confrontation, forgetting the appetizer and missing A Night of Istanbul."}
{"text":"Was around looking for something to eat. found this on yelp...
Amazing food. very delicious. Had the mixed plate for one with my wife was really good.
Bread is amazing comes one for free but if you want more it's 1.50/p.
Used the offer on yelp to get a free Turkish coffee... amazing taste and very rich. Will definitely go back if I'm around again..."}
{"text":"tl;dr - It's a welcoming place with really flavourful and comforting food, and excellent service. Also it is noobie friendly for Turkish food.

Menu:

Meze Tabagi (Hummus, Ayse`s Walnut Spread, Patlican Ezme and Domates Ezmesi)
- This was a very filling appetizer set as it featured a quartet of some of their more popular items.  It consisted of very tasty items with the two standouts being the Patlican Ezme (wonderful smokey eggplant flavour) and the Walnut Spread (very full flavour with the walnuts and spices).

Iskender Kebab
- The meat was definitely grilled and remained quite moist.  And believe me, I've had the worst end of this at other restaurants where the meat seemed almost boiled/steamed and left dry like a sock.  The yogurt on the side gave it some pleasant acidity and a freshness that helped balance out the heavy meat.

Beyti
- The tomato butter sauce on top rounded off the flavour, and to our surprise, did not make the yufka pastry soggy at all.  The vegetable garnishes were a welcome sight, because believe it or not, there is such a thing as \"too much meat\".

Ali Nazik
- Our star of the show was the eggplant and tahini mixture underneath.  It was very light and gave a wondrous nutty flavour to the dish.  The rice pilaf left more to be desired, but only minor points off. 

Baklava
- This was very freshly made for us and they did not skimp out on the ingredients.  A lot of other places I've been to like adding a lot of \"filler\" to their baklava.  If you love pistachio, you're in luck as they threw them everywhere and yes you could taste it!

Turkish Coffee
- A solid cup of coffee (not amazing, but not bad either).  It was a very good way to end my night as we just chatted away in our small group.  Also, it comes complementary if you check-in for the first time using Foursquare.

Service:

As my friends and I were somewhat new to Turkish cuisine, we took a bit more time to decide on what we should get.  Luckily, the waitress serving us did not hesitate to list her personal favourites. She gave a pretty thorough description why for each one (we asked for it).  She was very courteous, patient and cracked a joke here and there.  She graciously offered us tea on the house as we were finished and about to leave (I believe this is a Turkish custom?)."}
{"text":"Such lovely service and gets very busy around 7-8pm on a Friday evening. We got there around 7 and luckily was able to get a seat without reservations but the staff recommended that we do next time so they can also book a belly dancer for entertainment (they didn't think they would be that busy that night).

Food was delicious and definitely enjoyed the free hummus and bread. The milk pudding dessert was unique and tasted very fresh.

Parking is limited so if you can walk/bus that would be ideal but most stores on the strip are closed in the evening so we ended up parking infront of the other reserved spots for those shops."}
{"text":"Stopped by Anatolia Sunday night for dinner with four friends, despite arriving a few minutes before the kitchen's last call we were not rushed to order at all, and they even kept the kitchen running to take our orders. 

Our beautiful waitress recommended the mixed platter for four (despite us being five people) and assured us it would be sufficient. She was right! The mixed grill platter was quite large and every item was delicious. Hot bread and dip were served within seconds of our orders being taken. The service was fast and accurate. The dinning area was clean and tidy with  pleasant decor.

The front of house manager and the waitress were both extremely friendly and genuine despite it being the end of the day. We were made to feel at home! The waitress even got my phone charged for me.

If I had to be nit-picky (and its hard to nit pick in this case!) I would say that despite the washrooms being spotless, they were a bit gloomy and could use a renovation.

TLDR; great food (order the mixed plate if its your first time), superb service, friendly staff, pleasant atmosphere, great value."}
{"text":"Pretty out of the way for me, but made the trek with a friend to this place. It's good!

We both had the yogurt drink, which we both liked. We ordered an eggplant salad appetizer. I really liked it. My friend was so-so on it. We then split two mains. Mine was a mix grill dish and my friend's was a lamb dish. We liked them both. All of the meats were tasty - some, a little dry - but overall good. I think when I go back I would try the iskander. What really makes turkish food for me (and what I think makes it unique) is the combination of sauces they use (the tomato-based mildly spicy sauce, and the yogurt-based tangy sauce - an unlikely but perfect marriage with grilled meat)

I closed with a turkish coffee and some baklava (I was feeling gluttonous). The turkish coffee there was decent, but not the best i've had. I never really have baklava at restaurants that disappoints.

Overall, If I was in the mood for turkish food and I was going to be somewhere in the ballpark of this place, I would go again. Not sure I would make a special trip though."}
{"text":"We ordered:
Humus Dip
Mediterranean Salad
Grilled Kalamari
Mixed Grill For One

The above was more than enough for two people and everything was very good. I especially liked how all the dips were made fresh everyday with no preservatives or fillers.

Secondly, the service was friendly and helpful when suggesting the types of dishes and portions."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place after reading the reviews but I have to say I'm quite disappointed...the bread they have with the dips was hard as a rock....baba gnomish lacked flavour, just tasted so plan and the Lakmacun is kind of like a thin crust tomato sauce pizza.....the got the mixed grilled and didn't realize the Lakmacun came with it.....the waitress should have said something instead of us paying $9 for that Lakmacun.....the chicken was a little raw on the inside and the beef tasted like hamburger meat, only thing I liked about this place is the rice........"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend today for an early dinner and we really enjoyed the experience.

Food: There are lots of vegetarian options at this restaurant - which is great because I'm a vegetarian :) We ordered the vegetarian eggplant dish and black sea chicken. The black sea chicken said it was perfect for spicy lovers on the menu but when my boyfriend got it he said it wasn't too spicy (like so spicy you cant even eat it) and was perfectly edible. Everything seemed to have an underlying tomato taste - I think they use it in a lot of their sauces? The eggplant dish was also delicious and came with tomato-y rice and a dice veggie salad with a vinaigrette dressing (very refreshing). Before our food came out we got a basket of bread - it was like naan bread but not as chewy - with hummus. At the end we checked in using Yelp and got a free Turkish coffee! That was super tasty :)

Interiors: Very clean and rustic with earthy hues and bright blues. there was exposed brick and lots of art just hanging around, made the place seem really cozy. The music they played was Turkish (I think, I'm not Turkish so I don't really know but thats what I think it was... haha). The music was soothing and fun and wasn't blaring or anything, so you were still able to talk to the people you were eating without having to yell or anything. There was also a little vase with flowers on each table, so cute.

Service: The male server was very kind and had such a great smile! He was very responsive and helpful.

Price: The restaurant is a bit expensive in my opinion, our two dishes came to just under $40 but I didn't feel ripped off or anything, considering the portions, quality, ambiance and service.

Parking: There is free parking in front of the restaurant.

Hope this was helpful!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at this rest this summer but didn't review it until now. If you like Mediterranean food this is a rest that you'll need to try. We had the Anatolia Mixed plate & for the main we had Ishkender Kabob. All the food was very tasty & we were served by a polite young guy. What stood out is HOW the owner made us feel. She made us feel special. She visited our table in person & as she was just back from Turkey she was kind enough to give us a take home souvenir. My wife still has it. All-in-all....I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Beyti (special Turkish Kebap) was great!
6 of Turkish colliuqe we went to this location.
We had our soup upfront (lentil soup mercimek çorbas?) and than meze (special cold Turkish appetizer) then I had this lovely BEYT?!"}
{"text":"Went here last night (Saturday) and the place was packed (not sure why). I spend over $100 for 2 people and the food was ok but the service was really really bad. I asked for water and never got some. There were only 3 servers and probably the owner who came around once asking how the food was. Food tasted ok nothing special and portion sizes were small and very over priced!

Would not be going here again and there are plenty of good Turkish restaurants in Toronto. Sadly I live right across the street and wanted to supper a local business but that was definitely a mistake."}
{"text":"When it comes to restaurants, or basically anything in life, I'm cheap.  I'll admit it.  So unless it's a special occasion/once-in-a-while, Anatolia may be a bit much for a casual lunch.  It's about $20 for entrée ONLY, pre-tax, no app, drink, dessert, etc.

Note:  No lunch specials on weekends.

Having said that, the food at Anatolia was GOOD.  Pita with hummus arrived at the table prior to the food and the bread seemed homemade.  Meats were nicely marinated, vegs in salad were fresh, and rice was tasty!

The baklava was decent (more pastry than filling), I've had better elsewhere, re:  Baklawa King.  And the reg coffee was pretty decent.  Didn't need sugar as the baklava was already quite sweet!

Interior was tastefully decorated in a Turkish theme, warm, 'n cozy.

If you're on the West-end, Turkish Kebab House is a good, more affordable, but casual substitute.  (Menu isn't as extensive and they don't go to the extend of making their own pita &/or possibly their hummus.)  However, if you're looking for a nice, sitdown which feels that you've been transported to another country, Anatolia's got you covered!  (Menu's more extensive, make their own pita/spreads, but is more expensive.)

There's a parking lot, but it seems as though the spots are store-specific, so be aware!"}

{"text":"Amazing place to eat with family, friends and lovers however, I went to the night of istanbul. The price is really high for the quality and portion of the food. The food was ok I felt that other fast food restaurants had better taste."}
{"text":"Great landmark restaurant.   I have been here a couple of times for take out and have not been let down.   Well spiced meat, high quality, etc

Only complaint is it pricier than I expected.  Value may not be what most expect, however the food quality and freshness is what you pay for."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. I went to this restaurant for the first time last week and was new to Turkish food. We asked the waitress for recommendations and the choices were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Anatolia is a nice change of pace from what you'd normally find in the area.  It's down to earth but elegant, and the food is the authentic \"real deal.\"  When we were there we had a nice chat with the friendly owner, and she even gave us a sample of a dish she was considering putting on the menu (which was delicious, of course!)  For something different they also have belly dancers in (check the schedule but I believe it's Friday evenings.)  

They also offer Turkish cooking classes which I'd love to check out on of these days. Looking forwards to going back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Iskander Kabab was awesome! Little pricey but worth every penny as each dish is prepared on order. Environment is great for a nice romantic lunch/dinner. I wouldn't go in a large group."}
{"text":"The food is pricey and the portions are small. You might not feel full with one portion. It was also greasy! Considering the price, it should have been better. ."}
{"text":"A little Treasure of the Kipling area! You can get a nice chat with owner about traditional way of cooking Turkish food!  P.s. Do not be embarrassed by the outside view of the place, just come in and be amaized!"}
{"text":"My mom doesn't live in Toronto so I won't get to see her for a couple of weeks... but never fear Anatolia is here! Like Andre D. mentioned, the owner is a super cute Turkish woman who is personable, sweet and reminded me of my own lovely mama!

I ordered the calamari (delicious), the Mediterranean salad (she promised lots of cheese and she delivered) and the Bruschetta (OMG I love their bread)!

Mama taught us Turkish tea customs... like how to tell your host that you do or don't want more tea just by placing your spoon on your cup a certain way!

The free humus and bread basket we got was perfect and to top it off we ended the evening with complimentary Turkish Delight!

The first Friday or every night they apparently have belly dancers and prix fixed menu options... I will definitely be checking that out."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! got the speads and mixed platter and it was excellent. We will be returning"}
{"text":"I got to say this, one of the best turkish I've eaten here in Toronto. Top notch food (albeit portions could be a tee bigger), and the price ain't too shabby. Definitely get the lahmanchu or w/e it's called. It's peasant food, but who cares."}
{"text":"Wow I'm so glad I stopped here for dinner last night. I've never had Turkish food before but I was really hungry and I liked the way the sign looked so I ate here. Sometimes I'm adventurous with food ya know.
We walked into a small restaurant where we were seated immediately. It wasn't packed but there were a decent amount of diners on a Sunday night. 
The menu had quite a few options. There were lots of appetizers, and many entrees to choose from. We were served hot bread straight from the oven with hummus. It was delicious.
For dinner I went with an eggplant dish. Basically it was an eggplant stuffed with other veggies. This might be the first time I've ordered eggplant at a restaurant where it was cooked perfectly. The skin wasn't rubbery at all! It was so velvety and amazing! The flavours were all so good. 
The staff was super friendly too. I really enjoyed coming here and so glad I did."}
{"text":"Get the mixed grill plate here. You won't be disappointed. If that was the only dish we ordered, this place would be an easy 5/5. The meat is so tender and flavourful, and even the rice was amazing and tasty. The complimentary hummus and bread they give you in the beginning was also very good. My wife ordered the manti (dumplings), which were also good if a bit oily. It wasn't outstanding like the mixed grill plate was though. For the appetizer we got the karides tava, which were sauteed shrimp that tasted pretty similar to the garlic shrimp from Red Lobster except much less salty and kind of bland. I'd skip that dish next time. It was not worth the price IMO. The sauce makes for pretty good dip for the complimentary bread though.

Lastly, the service was friendly and the atmosphere is cozy and cute."}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for years snd finally tried this place not too long ago. I was very impressed by the quality of the food and the service. Ordered the grilled calamari which was outstanding and the shrimp which was amazing. Definitely want to go back"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 6/5 if it was possible! The food is fresh, well made, preservative free and tastes amazing...truly amazing. Just eat here once and decide for yourself. Service is also top notch alongside the atmosphere. Belly dancing on the first Friday off each month as well."}
{"text":"Meal was not bad missed true Turkish custom giving cologne leaving and tea was mediocre while Turkey has a strong tea culture."}
{"text":"Brought there by a friend, whose Turkish colleague highly recommended the place.

There was not much people inside when we arrived (weekend afternoon), and except for mine and my friend's wives, all the female customers had their heads covered - so the atmosphere was quite authentic.

Food was very authentic too, inexpensive and of a decent quality. Portions were not that large, but big enough not to feel hungry afterwards. Server was polite and fast, everything ordered arrived on the table without delay.

Why three stars? Location - you will need a car to get there, or walk quite a distance from the subway. Interior was also very cheapish, though clean, and did not create anything that may be considered as a comfortable or cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had an absolutely wonderful experience here, it feels just like a European restaurant (I haven't been to Turkey) in it's simplicity and atmosphere.  The owners are really lovely and passionate.  The food is fantastic, really fresh and authentic. If you ask them for recommendations you'll see how passionate they are about the food."}
{"text":"Had try after just coming back from a trip to Turkey.  Found it to be typical of restaurants we visited in Istanbul.  The flat breads were good."}
