{"text":"We didn't even eat, the owner was rude to us and his staff so we left. Customers and staff should be treated with respect. we will not go back."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim, on a late Saturday afternoon.  No place else was open for a late lunch/early dinner.  So glad we did!  Yummy chocolate martinis and really good food.  All four of use loved our entrees- seafood, pasta and pizza.  If I lived in Toronto I would be a regular!"}
{"text":"I saw MayPac there, it was first time, cool relaxed atmosphere. There was 4 of us and my friends were from out of town. This place is impressive and represents Toronto in best light. People were amazing and friendly, staff good looking and pro, steak was really good. Pretty impressed. I'll be back for sure.  Great job."}
{"text":"1 star because  I can't  give  zero! I made a reservation  and stood at the front, unacknowledged  for 5min. Finally the bartender  noticed  me and came over and  asked  about my reservation.  It was not her job. The owner  eventually  came over and said have a seat at the bar,  ill take care of you. We sat there  for 20min! No one said anything.  Finally i started  calling other restaurants  in the  area. Spuntini took down  my name, said 20min and meant  it! I told him what  had happened  across the street to which  he was  shocked  and  said, \"here, we'll  take  care  of you!\" We were promptly  seated! Coco Lezzone, bad bad  bad."}
{"text":"Since Coco has moved from College into this spot on Avenue just south of Davenport, it's lost its vibe. This exact spot was the new Vittorio's just before CL took it over, and I have to admit that I really miss Vittorio's Monday night lobster linguine deal. Sadly, since CL took over this much smaller (than before) space, the vibe is really lacking, though the food is still very good. Luckily for me, food is the reason I go in the first place but given the above, they really should revive Vittorio's--at least on Mondays. ;) But besides that, I think College suited CL much better.  I won't get into the interior too much because I care more for the food, but it's a narrow space with stools around the bar upon entry (this set up actually gives it a stuffy feel when you first walk in) and a number of tables up a short flight of stairs to your left.  Service is attentive and professional--in other words, very good. We stuck to mostly seafood the night we went. We started with the grilled octopus which I would have preferred in whole pieces, but instead it comes chopped up and mixed in with a roquette salad with a tasty dressing containing balsamic, olive oil, and pepper. The presentation is lacking and cheapens a bit what would have been a nice dish. We also had the lobster ravioli which tasted fine but when it comes to lobster, it's kind of nice not to overdo it with other, stronger flavours (tomato sauce) that might interfere with the flavour of the lobster itself, but since we're talking shreds of lobster meat, I suppose they couldn't leave things too unfettered. We also shared the Chilean sea bass which is one of my favourite fish. Instead of a filet or whole fish, this came out as a large, thick mound which was cooked perfectly: the flesh was very tender and flaky, not tough or rubbery whatsoever. It came with a variety of vegetable pieces which were seasoned simply but tasted quite good. We skipped dessert and had some elsewhere but more for a change of scenery as the restaurant was not busy at all that night. Not that we minded, as the lack of noise allowed us to have a conversation.   They also have a good selection of wine, as in a decent variety to choose from, along with other alcohol. The prices can be a bit steep, depending on what you order, but at least serving sizes are fairly decent. Our dinner with wine, but not including tax or tip was $130, so not for those on a budget for sure. I'd like to try their osso buco next time, which is to say that I would recommend Coco Lezzone if you're looking for some good Italian food downtown, but away from the hustle and bustle."}
{"text":"Walked into this Yorkville gem and was greeted by the hostess with a great smile. I was waiting for the rest of my party so I sat up at the bar where the bartender made me a killer Manhattan. Finally the rest of my party arrived (late as usual) was fortunate after a short wait they honored our reso. the place was jammed. We were told by our waiter to try the seafood platter and BOOM it was awesome!! I followed that with the branzino and we had a dessert platter with fruit the tiramisu was very good. The rest of my party had pasta and it sounded like they all enjoyed. We will be back! Now if only I can remember that hostesses name."}
{"text":"On April 25th, 2015, my friends and I had dinner at this fabulous Italian restaurant.  I travel to Toronto a few times a year, it is always a tough decision when picking a place for all my pals to meet at.  This time, my friend, recommended the new location of Coco Lezzone.  We had been to the old location, and had a great time, so when she suggested it, I said \"yes\".  We had a wonderful meal, the service was great, my friends were happy, and they even surprised us with a little dessert for the table.  Thanks, Steve, for making our evening special, while we were in Toronto visiting.  We will definitely recommend your restaurant to people who want good Italian food.  That is a big compliment, as Toronto, I think is the capital of Italian food.  lol Thanks."}
{"text":"While we know Coco Lezzone for the fish and the seafood, at the end of the day we come because it's an Italian restaurant with vibrant bold flavours. Salari tells us that in addition to the fish and grilled meats, gluten-free pasta has become very popular.   There are taste thrills to be found in the appetizers, including an added pizza section. Calamari is big. Dressed with a jalape√±o aioli, it's got a kick that keeps on kickin'. The grilled Moroccan octopus, cooked over an hour and a half with the same recipe he's used for fourteen years, is the best octopus in the city. \"It's the way we do it. Anybody who orders it, they love it.\"  The ingredient to Salari's success? Personal service with his clients. \"If you want a chicken Caesar or a salmon Caesar, we're very flexible with what people want, and it only takes two seconds to change it\". It's the honesty of classic Italian cuisine in an upscale Ave & Dav ambience. The room is sexy (lighting is everything) with white leather booths, and the bar invites us to linger and have another glass of wine. Around the restaurant we see a mixed crowd of businessmen in conversation, couples and families dining out, and singles mingling at the bar. There is a private chef's table, and an even more discreet private dining room where friends come to celebrate.  For me, the true test is the tomato sauce. Linguine pomodori is a tribute to traditional fare. Caprese salad is a stack of thickly layered tomatoes and boconncini with swirls of sweet basil balsamic dressing, and a basket of homemade, olive-studded rolls. I'm happy. The signature dish is whole grilled striped bass that serves two admirably. I am eyeing a plate of veal scaloppini being enjoyed at a neighbouring table--it's in my little black book to order when I return to check out the $1 oyster Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Nice vibe. Chill yet hipster-like. Classy enough for Yorkville without being snotty. Great portions on the food with loads of flavour. The staff is super friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for dinner now. First time it was for a special event and was ordering off a set menu -- pretty decent. Second, finally got to try the regular menu and really enjoyed everything. However, last night I was there and perhaps it was because my Raptors were plummeting to their second loss, but I just wasn't enjoying anything. Their pappardelle, although the menu was very tender and delicious, the noodles were a bit overcooked and the pesto was....meh? (Clearly my ability to articulate this morning is impeccable...) and finally I thought there was too much Parmesan cheese.   Of course I love this spot for a drink after work and I always find it a struggle to locate places in Yorkville with televisions to watch a game however, I'm hoping I just caught Coco on an off night."}
{"text":"I've eaten here at least 5 times since Coco Lezzone took over from Vittorio's. The atmosphere and 'vibe' as another reviewer put it, have indeed changed a great deal - for the worse. The food and wines are good, sometimes excellent, in fact. The service can be quite good but not always consistently so. We went last Friday night (the coldest Friday of 2016) and it was quite empty - we thought it was because of the cold weather.  After our evening I'm wondering if others  share my pushback for the two large flat screens that were unavoidably in my face the whole night. A black and white still on the wall of Mastroianni  and Eckberg would have been ok; a moving picture (of a philandering paparazzo journalist living in Rome in 1960, including a drug overdose and scenes of women being slapped - geesh!) detracted from the quiet dinner my husband and I were seeking - as he was seated across from me he missed the flickering tv screens and I put energy into avoiding the distraction. I'm guessing this investment is someone's well-intentioned idea of creating an authentic Italian atmosphere; it will stop me from going back. It's not at all conducive to an intimate dining experience. Looking for an expensive sports bar? This may be the place."}
{"text":"The new location for this old school Little Italy gem has not had good luck lately. Here's hoping the Coco team can beat the curse. It's a nice addition to our neighbourhood and we stopped in Friday without reservations before a concert.   Pros: same or similar menu from their old place, at least I was able to order the staples I loved. Lots of flavour and rich without being overwhelming. Prompt and professional service. Friendly, and easy going style and pretty good value.   Cons: slightly older, stiffer crowd the night were there. I also think they have gone a bit cold with white leather, mirror and blue light.   Overall, we will stop on again and I think it would be a good place to take my folks or in laws when they visit."}
{"text":"Food was average. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again. I do feel that they still deserve a three star since they did provide very friendly service and the location is great!"}
{"text":"I attended a media event for Coco Lezzone. Coco Lezzone is high-end Italian restaurant in Yorkville, near the intersection of Davenport and Avenue. My foodie friends loved the Sicillian Pizza ($19) since it had the best toppings. After, they brought out plates of appetizers, ranging from Italian Cold Cut Plate ($16) to Calamari ($15). Those ran out pretty quickly.  The host brought out four of Coco Lezzone's popular dishes for the food bloggers to take photos of. Unfortunately once the photos were done, all the plates were demolished between 10 or so people. Therefore I had a less than accurate tasting opinion on all these dishes (I believe I missed out on the Osso Buco completely!). I personally enjoyed the Seafood Risotto ($22) because I like my meal to have some sort of grain in it. Everyone raved about the Chilean Seabass ($38). I'm not a fish person but it was good, based on the one forkful I had of it.  I think Coco Lezzone would be a lovely anniversary spot or even for a private company party. They also have a Date Night menu where you get a three course meal for a deal of $35."}
{"text":"We had the Chilean Sea bass and osso buco.  The food, service and atmosphere were all excellent.  We will definitely be back.  Thanks for a great time Andy!"}
{"text":"Coco Lezzone is a place where men can take ladies out to dinner on Thurs, Friday and Saturday nights, and still watch sports in comfort with their friends. There are big screen TV everywhere you look in Coco's, but strangely it doesn't diminish from the decor.  Indeed this place is the perfect mix - it feels upscale with chrome steel railings, wood covered walls and white marble counters  The food is terrific. The staff is friendly and vibe is lively and sporty.  The restaurant stocks a vast selection of expensive liquors and offers the best vintages from a carefully curated wine collection. I had the Osso Buco - slow braised veal shank with saffron risotto, and it was delicious, and the taste of the saffron i wont soon forget as its not something i encounter very often. I'm giving it five stars because it exceeded my expectations in every way..."}
{"text":"My first time there- Service was great, BUT their pizza was probably the worst in the city... I think McCain makes it better! Sorry."}
