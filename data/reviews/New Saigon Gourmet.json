{"text":"I love this place.  The preparation is slow, so if you are getting delivery then be prepared to wait about 90 minutes.  Even take out takes longer than you'd expect.  But the food is fresh and delicious, so it's usually worth it if you have time to wait!"}
{"text":"Based on what I've read in the other reviews, I think Saigon Gourmet's biggest shortcoming is that they are inconsistent.

I first visited Saigon Gourmet on a Saturday night. Boyfriend and I stood outside, looking into the (completely) empty dining room. Nervous about what that could imply, we stood outside and checked the Yelp reviews.

\"Good enough,\" we thought, and dared to venture in.

We ordered our respective favourites, and the food was good. We didn't wait very long, and the service was kind and attentive, but not overbearing.

The serving portions were ample (not huge, like the XL pho vats) and the ingredients were fresh.

As a pho lover, I was underwhelmed by the selection in meats, but I chalked it up to it being a fusion place (does Viet-Chinese count as fusion?).

So we returned a few times, trying the take-out options too. Turns out take-out pho is VERY packaging intensive. Now, we bring our own glass containers and we can save the environment too.

At times, the broth has been bland, and the bean sprouts a little wilted. But at other times, the broth is thick and flavourful. Consistency, that would be the 5th star.

By the way, it never seems to have any customers inside. How does it survive?"}
{"text":"Yum! Super friendly and attentive staff. Meal was large and I could have taken the rest home for a second meal but it was so delicious I couldn't help myself and I finished it off! I had planned on taking photos but I was too busy enjoying how yum it was :) 
I went back for a take away lunch a few days later and still so happy with service, taste and value!
And got to love free fortune cookies haha"}
{"text":"Moved into the neighbourhood about a year ago and only got around to eating here recently. Now I've eaten there at least 5 times.  I go for the pretty white-washed selections, but all of those have been solid. A dinner for two, with some substitutions from chicken balls / wings to other cool stuff like Beef+Brocolli or Crispy Ginger Beef, usually lasts about 3 meals for two average people. I've had the schezuan noodles and just chinese brocolli in oyster sauce, haven't been disappointed with either. Slowly working my way through the menu, 1 new dish at a time. I haven't made the rounds on Spadina, but I like it just as much as the restaurants in Chinatown. I'd like to try Dim Sum here.. it's also on the todo list. The place is never busy and the interior is spotless. Just get it."}
{"text":"Came around 2pm on a weekday. this place is under rated. Got the shanghai noodles and chicken fried rice. Food was very delicious.

Overall high recommend! would def come back."}
{"text":"Ate dinner on a Saturday with my girlfriend. We ordered wonton soup, beef with oyster sauce and a couple of dim sum. Food and service were great."}
{"text":"I recently moved into the neighbourhood, and wanted to check it out.

We ordered a crispy beef dish, Szechuan chicken dish, and vegetable fried rice.  All were really good!  The crispy beef was actually crispy, with a delicious zing of ginger.  The Szechuan chicken was also very good - nice crisp snow peas, carrots and peppers mixed in there! 

I will definitely be spending lots more money here!  The prices are good, the portions are generous, and the young woman at the counter was very courteous and offered water and a seat while we waited for takeout.

A great neighbourhood restaurant!"}
{"text":"Worst Pho I've had...was very bland, with emphasis on very. It simply tasted like hot water and rice noodles. Even the basil was wilted.  Not an experience I'm willing to repeat."}
{"text":"Wow, really really bad!

I have ordered from here for years and it is inconsistent at best. I love Lemon Chicken and when this place does it good its great!  The last 3 times it has been terrible. The delivery is slow and this time it was so slow that it was cold, nothing worse than cold Lemon Chicken and the sauce was lumpy! Yuck."}
{"text":"Saigon Gourmet is the place to go if you are very hungry but don't have anything specific in mind. Its meals are consistent, fairly priced and comes in generous portions. There are the dinner for 2, 3 or 4 deals, which is what I usually choose when going with my family. A dinner for 3 can easily serve 5, and we always wrap the left to go. Food doesn't take long to prepare, by the time the hot tea is served the chicken balls are rolling out.
Total cost for today's dinner for 3: $40 with beverages, tax and tips included. P.S.: Dinner combos are also served at lunch time.
There is free Wi-Fi and plenty of free parking spots around the corner (enter on Manning Ave and return on Clinton St) or park on the dime just in front of it.
They take lots of takeaway orders and also do delivery."}
{"text":"I really enjoy new saigon gormet.. I've ordered from here a few times now and have not been disappointed. The dim sum is really good, the hot and sour soup is delicious."}
{"text":"I've been craving for Pho, so I turned to Yelp for a place nearby that does delivery. I studied their old take away menu I found online. It's cold and a winter storm's a comin' so I'm not about to walk extra blocks to get my pho fix.

Unfortunately when I called, they had removed the vietnamese part of their menu, but offered a cantonese noodle soup and all-day dim sum so I went thru with an order.
- Fried calamari with spicy salt - tasty but you can't go wrong with spicy salt
- Spring rolls - typical
- Cantonese beef noodle soup - BLAND
- Soup filled steam pork bun (XLB) - Ok flavour but not 'soup filled'
- General Tao chicken w/ broccoli - pretty good
Bill came up to $40 including tax n tip.

Might order again if my fridge is completely empty and it's raining fire - or if I'm super lazy and willing to settle for mediocre dim sum delivery.
Posted a picture of their current menu if you're interested."}
{"text":"This review is only for the Dim sum orders I had here as New Saigon Gourmet serve all day Dim sum and my goddess was it bad.
The taste and texture for each of the dim sum dishes was poorly executed, all of it tasted nothing from a real Dim sum restaurant stand point, very bland, the shrimp for the shrimp rolls and ha gow tasted frozen and heated up from a microwave yuke!  You will literally have better tasting Dim sum from a food court in a asian supermarket like TnT and New Ocean, I repeat better tasting Dim sum from a supermarket food court, even buying frozen Dim sum and heating it up yourself from steaming or microwave will taste A LOT better.

If you are planning to have Dim sum here, stop right away and head to a REAL Dim sum restaurant down on Spadina or any where else, you will find better chance at the Loblaws across the street to find frozen Dim sum, why pay more for frozen and bland Dim sum here when you can get the slightly better, cheaper frozen Dim sum at Loblaws."}
{"text":"News Flash!: Saigon Gourmet has been taken over by the operater/owner of Bamboo (on the Danforth) They have freshened up the place and serve a variety of standard Chinese dishes. Portions are large, but so is the price. Pricier than other chinois restos in the area. Just opened two weeks ago, so they are extremely vigilant with their customers. Hope that attitude lasts."}
{"text":"Vietnamese & Chinese culinary mix. Good prices and free wireless.
Take, delivery & eat in all good."}
{"text":"This is our local Seaton Village take out Chinese food restaurant . We always get dinner for two. If you don't like chicken balls you can substitute them for the price difference on their menu. The food is plentiful and always good. Spring roll is crunchy and chow mein has lots of chicken.lt is prepared quickly and always on time and  hot for pickup.  You can order, hop over to Loblaws for a few things and presto its ready. Its family owned and much better than a chain. Incredible deal for two under $25. Owners are very accomodating and friendly."}
{"text":"I got some take-out here last night. The food was great, for a take-out Chinese place. Their prices are reasonable at about $8 per dish. As other's have said they're a little slow at the prep. They said my order would be ready in 25 minutes but when I got there I still had to wait another 10 or so minutes.

Their decor is interesting. It's all stone tables and walls. They use padded benches instead of chairs at the tables which is an interesting twist. The front of the restaurant opens up so during the summer you can enjoy the weather while digging into your noodles.

There's a 10% discount if you pay cash."}
{"text":"After a toss up with my friend on where to eat last week during the bitter cold evening, we decided to look for somewhere close to home.

3 blocks away, we decided to give this place a try.  We came in fairly late, at around 10pm and they took us in and was very attentive and nice.

We ordered some shrimp wanton soup, chow mein for him and the thai style noodles which to me tasted like pad thai(which is great btw, my fave).

Everything from start to finish was great.  The portions they give you are HUGE! The price is pretty decent as well.

Will have to try this place again and try out their \"all day dim sum\""}
{"text":"Saigon Gourmet has a lot going for it.

So you're a little bit inconsistent? Who cares... you order dinner for two for under $25 and it comes with chicken wings. Chicken wings! Fun! It also comes with chicken balls, fried rice, spring roles, chow mein and fortune cookies.

Is this the most authentic Chinese food in town? Obviously not. Not by a long shot. My friend Veronica O'Keefe makes more authentic fried rice, but that doesn't make it place any less delicious. 

My friend Sonam R and I recently ordered some to our door on a Saturday night and it arrived within 20 minutes. We had to add some bonus eats to our order because they have a $25 delivery minimum, but what are spring rolls without egg rolls? They're like Bonnie without Clyde, or Sonam without magazines, or something of the sort. 

PEPPER POINTS: For their little coupons that come with orders... think Ms Saigon Canadian Tire Money. The best."}
