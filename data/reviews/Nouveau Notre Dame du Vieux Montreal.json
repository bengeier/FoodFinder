{"text":"As a quick stop for a bite to eat in Old Montreal, this place was just fine. A typical Greek diner, they offered a decent price (under $10) for a burger and fries, and a perfectly-tasty poutine. The cook was also the server, and had the food out to us in about 10 minutes...just in time to save us from starvation?"}

{"text":"My friends and I stumbled upon this restaurant, late in the evening about a couple weeks ago while on vacation up in Montreal.  we were out at night walking the streets and taking photos and we were starving.  We walked in and we were greeted by this very tall and almost intimidating looking guy. But he was the nicest and funniest person ever! His name is Jimmy and he is the son of the owner. Jimmy runs the place in the evenings, and from what I saw, he is well known and liked by the locals.  He talked and joked with us for a while and then he recommended some things on the menu as well as the special for the evening.   We all ordered The Poutine,  and it was by far the best Poutine we had in Montreal.  I ordered a hamburger and that was tasty as well.  If you are ever in Montreal,  stop by this place and get the Poutine.  And if you're lucky you'll get to chat with Jimmy as well. I give them 4 stars for the friendliness as well as for the awesome Poutine."}
