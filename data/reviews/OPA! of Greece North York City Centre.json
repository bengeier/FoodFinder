{"text":"Salad and bread were okay.  Souvlaki was super dry cold and portion was tiny.  It's all precooked and they grilled it for less than a minute.  Only 4 small cubes on the skewer and one was all drizzle.  Would definitively not go back."}
{"text":"Opa! Of Greece opened inside the new food court at North York City Centre on Jan 7, 2012.  As a new food court, this place had extremely long lines, as did every other restaurant in the food court.  I don't really know where all of these new people are coming from.  As for the food - Opa! is very similar to Mr. Greek.  The prices were reasonable - probably $8 after tax depending on what you order.  I had a gyros on a pita with a salad.  I also had a skewer of pork souvlaki. I'd rate the food as just ok.  The meat was a little on the dry side for me, and there wasn't very much gyros on the pita.  If I hadn't ordered a souvlaki skewer on the side - which was $2.99 - I would have been hungry."}
{"text":"Opa! Of Greece is located inside the food court in the North York City Centre. It is your standard Greek food you have come to expect from a court food with reasonable prices.   The quality of the food is average, and fine for the price. Sometimes the chicken can be more on the dry side probably from sitting on the steam table.   If you are just looking for something light, like a lunch then this place is acceptable. I wouldn't come here other then for a quick bite to eat but that's probably why it is located in a food court."}
{"text":"Today I ordered gyro pita. The bread is great and the portion is enough to fill you without feeling too stuffed. The girls working there are very attentive in crazy busy hours and make sure you get exactly what you order and how you like it."}
