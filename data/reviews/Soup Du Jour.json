{"text":"I visited this location for lunch while taking a business trip.

Wow was I impressed! The staff was very accommodating to my diet, and recommended which soups to get.

I had the carrot & polenta soup ( what an interesting combination), as well as the vegetarian teriyaki pizza. 

Both were EXTREMELY delicious! I only wish I could bring back some of it home in the states :("}
{"text":"Just went for the first time today. Pretty large menu, but I didn't find it overwhelming. Had the chicken wrap with mixed greens, black olives, roasted veggies, roasted peppers and spicy hummus and obviously a piece of the pumpkin loaf, which was all fresh and delicious and very reasonably priced. Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Soup du Jour is a hidden gem that is easily passed by. They have a gourmet market which I find fantastic for finding little unique items to give as gifts. The homemade soups are delicious and the cakes are to die for."}
{"text":"Several years back (when I was a younger man), I took my first job in a little mobile phone store located in the Caledon town of Bolton and shortly there after Soup Du Jour opened it's door inside a near by medical building!

The owner (whose name escapes me now) is a creative lunch genius and does lunch exceptionally well. As it's been awhile the things that stand out in my memory are their made to order salads, daily soup offerings (which are made from scratch daily), artisan sandwiches AND my personal fave their meat (or even vegetarian chilli). 

The chilli is always served with hunks of bread for dipping and it's the perfect on cold cold winter days. Pro-tip: If they still have it ask for the DIY spicy cayenne spray for your bowl of chilli, definitely go ALL in on this ISH. 

Pro-tip #2: Aim in the right direction.... one day, maced myself....chilli did NOT taste as good that day.... sigh, FML.

Anyway, it's located off of McEwan in the plaza right next door to Wal-Mart!

{"text":"So the soups sometimes need a bit of salt, big deal. Everyone there is soooo nice it's refreshing! Love that they have daily specials although I'd like to see more variety and not so many repeats. Other than that is a good healthy option!"}
{"text":"I brought my coworkers out here for lunch and left expecting a bit more after reading the other reviews. 

Soup Du Jour is styled in a subway-like business where you can get a sandwich/wrap/salad and they prepare everything in front of you. One of the first issues that our group had was deciding what to get, as all the options can be overwhelming for someone that has never been there before. 

Choice anxiety is real here. We saw choices between 6 different soups, and several combinations of salads/wraps/sandwiches with chicken, deli meats, roasted vegetables and more options. Most places have signature sandwiches or wraps, this place does not and leaves me to figure out what is good or not between the meats/sauces/other combination of foods you can make. 

I had a chicken wrap topped with lettuce, onions, peppers, olives, and topped with their maple dijon mustard (which was recommended by our server). They will panini press your wrap, which leaves nice grill marks but doesn't heat up your wrap that well. Because they don't cook your chicken (or grilled veggies) when ordered, the cold chicken was only marginally warmer than when it was pulled from the line. I don't have any issues with my chicken or veggies being pulled from a line like they do at many other restaurants (think chipotle or subway), but I could tell it was overcooked and left there because it was dry and tasteless and barely warm after the being taken out of the press. 

My 2 coworkers and I thought that all 3 different soups we tried were lacking in substance. The curry soup I had was very watery and had little flavor. The lentil soup also seemed watery and the chili was not thick and more akin to a vegetable stew than a real chili.  

With so many options at this place I wish they would consolidate the menu and focus on having better, richer, thicker soups and serve fresh and hot sandwiches."}
{"text":"I like to get the soups. My mom makes homemade soup and this is right up there. I get the Italian panini with the balsamic. I need to try the other sandwiches. So far the pastries have been tasty. It appears she has take home meals as well. It's a nice little spot. I will be back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem.  Food quality is high.  Prices extremely reasonable.  Small simple menu for lunch of soups and paninis.  My soup was split pea.  A little smoother than expected but yummy!"}
{"text":"This is a friendly market that sells delicious cakes and soups. It's not fancy inside, but \"homey\" - kind of like the candy store I went to as a child. I don't visit often (not on my usual drive) but stopped yesterday for the first time in a while and was happy to see that they added small tables and chairs inside. The lack of ample seating had stopped me from inviting friends to meet me there in the past - but no more! I bought 2 slices of cake to go - a berry and cream cake with yellow batter and an oreo cake - chocolate batter with cream filling. Both were delicious. The flavor and texture is wonderfully homemade, moist, full of flavor and with a good \"crumb,\" as my grandmother would have said. I've tried soups in the past and enjoyed them. I haven't tried the frozen meals but nice to have that option. I'm looking forward to having a reason to buy a whole cake! Yum!"}
{"text":"As our office moved to Bolton we all found ourselves struggling to find a good spot to eat for a very decent price.  We finally came across Soup Du Jour.  The location is relatively small but packs quite a large number of seats, as well as a great menu of delicious foods.  The specialty of the house is Soup (as the name implies); however, I am most inclined to buy the Tuna Salad Wrap for lunch every time.  I have tried the soups before too and they are simply delicious.  Every one of the soups tastes unique and is served with a side of whole wheat bread (not the sliced bread but the good stuff!).  After trying different things I settled on the Tuna Salad Wrap because it is simply delicious and a great deal for the price.  I have been asked by several people when they have seen me bring the wrap back to work as to where I got it, because it looks so packed with amazing toppings.

The wrap comes in a whole wheat wrap and one gets a choice of toppings to add to the tuna salad.  One can choose from mixed greens, lettuce, mushrooms, olives (green and black), green and red peppers, capers, tomatoes, banana peppers and other toppings, including toppings for which you need to pay extra.  The free toppings are great enough and make the Tuna Salad Wrap the most appealing item for me.  

Whenever I enter the place I am also greeted as a regular customer, and even those that do not frequent the place are always welcomed with a great smile and a \"What can I get for you today?\".  I have never experienced any negative comments from any of the clients that I have seen come and go through this location.  Everything is always clean at this place too and it shows that great care is taken to ensure that the client is satisfied in every way possible.  It is also great to know that the foods used at the store are fresh and bought locally, supporting the local economy.

I would recommend this location to anybody in the area and even for those that are passing by and looking for something fresh and local to enjoy for lunch."}
