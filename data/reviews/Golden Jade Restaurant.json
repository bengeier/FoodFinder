{"text":"Excellent hand pulled chicken!   The rice vermicelli tasted good but I don't think it was actually rice vermicelli - more like noodles, that's why it remained firm.  We also had fried sticky rice - not greasy and very well-made.  Watch out for the over-priced garlic stir-fried vegetables at the outrageous price of $16!  Go for the boiled veggies at only $4.50.  Will go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"It's the same Golden Jade at silver star. Portion of dishes are big. Good to have 4 + ppl to go."}
{"text":"Restaurant is owned by last owners of tsui wah on Kennedy, and really I thought they would maintain the cheap, HK fast food style that they've done generally well. However, since they started business at this location and kept the modern decor of Lemongrass, I find that they are trying to awkwardly transition into the \"fancier\" (relative to HK cafes, so really fancy just means more HK style western food ex. baked rice w/ cheese) route. I missed the breakfast specials, and was too early for the lunch specials so I got a baked pork chop on rice w/ tomato sauce cause there was a picture on the menu, and usually when there's a picture you would think it's something good that they want you to order.

I was completely naive in my way of thinking. The appearance of my dish looked like sweet and sour pork, as it was DROWNING in tomato sauce. Furthermore, it wasn't even baked in the oven, nor was there any cheese which is pretty standard for this kind of dish. My dad tried the HK style curry beef brisket and it was also disappointing as the curry was neither spicy nor flavorful. I would assume however that if you ordered chinese-oriented fast food dishes like chow mein or anything that popular back at Tsui Wah they would probably do a good job at it. Overall, a meh experience, along the lines of a 2.5."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quick service. Signature noodles is a must try.
Owner always come out to greet clients."}
{"text":"This place is great for dinner - the owner gives great personal service. The noodles on the minced meat is delicious and the eggplant is a house specialty - no brainer. Great service. Food arrived quickly and he even tossed our noodles for us at the table."}
{"text":"I think the rice noodle is fair but during my visit today, I had a bad experience with their customer service which they DID NOT ASK if I need changes back when they took away my money and collected all of them as tips. I  had 2 bows of rice noodle which is $7.5 each the bill with HST is $16.95, I gave them $20 and I was waiting for my changes back. I am willing to pay more tips if they ask \"do u need any changes back?\" But they did not ask at all! After 15 mins wait, I asked my server where is my change? She said she will help me check. After she came back she asked: did you pay $20? I said yes, and she replied your bill is $18 ( she assumed she can collect tips without ask me LOL)   I will never ever go back to this restaurant. I think this is not a money matter, it is poor customer service. They should respect customer in order to get more tips!"}
{"text":"Always a good experience at this restaurant. Quality of food is consistent, fairly priced for the generous portions. Love coming here for a quick lunch. Highly recommend their fried glutinous rice (\"lor mai fan) and their very popular guilin style noodles."}
{"text":"As of May 31st, 2015 Golden Jade at 633 Silver Star closed for good.  Owner is trying to look for a new location to reopen it up."}
{"text":"I came here for a Father's Day dinner with my family on recommendation with my mother.  This is pretty much a typical Hong Kong fast food style restaurant. The restaurant has a nice decor from the previous restaurant, Lemongrass. The service was decent, the waiters were very attentive and provided some good customer service. They gave my family a pleasurable experience. 

In terms of the food, the food arrived very quickly. It was a pleasant surprise since we were dining in the peak hours, even on a holiday! Well, we ordered their House Special Duck, which was something different from what I was expecting. It was very succulent in taste with a nice sour taste from the garnish on top. The Honey Glazed Oysters were honestly a favorite of mines. The oysters had a combination of crunchy, sweet, spicy all wrapped in one bite.  

I would recommend coming here if you want a quick meal, but warning, if you are a restauranteur like me , you would rather try something that just has an edge over restaurants like this."}
{"text":"I have to say that I'm not a big fan of the  spicy-sour flavour combo, which is the core of the cuisine served here. That said they did an amazing job with their noodles. Their portions are huge and they weren't too skimpy with their meat either. The star of the meal was their fried sticky rice dish. It was really good and packed with flavour - a definite must try. But be forewarned it is $10 and it's not a huge portion."}
{"text":"Mediocre noodle experience and poor customer service.

Ordered the Gui Lin noodle and some of the beef pieces were hard to chew. Soup wasn't as tasty, definitely had better Gui Lin noodles at other restaurants. The waiter also kept suggesting that we order more things and disapproved of what we decided on. Even as we were eating, someone came up to us and shook their head while saying we should've ordered a bunch of other dishes. Not quite an encouraging experience."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick lunch. We chose here because this is the only place in that small plaza without a line up. We were seated immediately.

We ordered 2 congees (sweet corn & assorted seafood), 1 cold dish (pig stomach with cucumbers (spicy)) and 1 hot dish (deep fried chicken wings). 

The portion for the dishes aren't as big as we expected, but still fairly satisfactory for the price. I personally really liked the sweet corn congee, it was very light and tasty. The assorted seafood was alright, but the seafood wasn't fresh so it ruined the taste of the congee. The chicken wings were decent as well, just a little too spicy and salty for my liking, nothing too special but nothing to complain about. The cold dish was way too salty, and had a LOT of MSG added. I personally didn't enjoy that dish very much.

Overall, we paid $27 for a lunch for three people (tax & tips included). Service was quick, portion was decent. It wasn't horrible, but there's nothing special. Recommended if you want a cheap and quick bite."}
{"text":"Great service ! Great people! Great food!

It's super cozy and the food is really good. A very intimate place 
Tip: Rmb to book ahead for seafood."}
{"text":"Always excellent food and excellent service. Much tastier than most chinese restaurants. They are most famous for their lamb hot pot. If you like lamb, you have to order it, it's so good! It's huge though, you can share amongst 4 people."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner.  I guess this is an okay place for lunch, but for dinner, the menu is limited.  It lasts a whopping total of 1 page only.  We ordered a Ginger and Onion Oyster Hot Pot ($14), a Stir Fried House Sticky Rice ($10) and a Boiled Vegetable ($3.50).  The only reason we ordered the sticky rice was because we were not interested in the rest of the dinner dishes.

Having said that, the Oyster Hot Pot was tasty.  It had good portion of oysters.  The sticky rice was alright, and the quality was in line with the quality that I would expect at this price point.  The Boiled Vegi was standard.

I read the noodle menu.  I notice it has mainly vermicelli and instant noodles.  They start at $7.50 and up.  I find that it is a bit pricey for vermicelli, but maybe it is that good."}
{"text":"This is the same Golden Jade as the one that used to be located on Silver Star Blvd.  The owner reopened it here approximately a month ago.  

The food, the portion and the prices were all on par with market.  We ordered 1 rice entree and 2 noodle entrees.  I found the flavours a little bland, but it could be just me, as I had eaten some bold tasting food the evening before.  The Cantonese stir fried noodle was fresh with lots of meat and stuffs.  It was the best dish of the three that we ordered.  The \"dry lo\" noodle was unique.  The colour implied that it was salty, but it really wasn't.  The oiliness level was acceptable. The fried rice didn't look as appetizing, but my mom was okay with it.  The portion of both noodles could feed a man of big appetite, or 1.5 eater of average appetite.  The portion of the rice was of 1-person portion.  Most rice and noodle dishes are priced between $9 to $12 before tax.  There are dinner entrees on menu, and they are more expensive.  I didn't order any dinner entree, so I cannot comment on them.

Services was more attentive than other HK tea cafe.  The premise is newly renovated, so it was clean."}
{"text":"I had lamp soup with noodle, lemon duck wth rice noodle, and dessert are really good! Good service too. They suggested which type of noodle to go with which dishes. Also told is if we ordered the right portion. Some restaurants would tell you to forget more regardless the portion. Will come back and try other dishes for sure."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch (well...afternoon snack) upon request from my parents.

We ordered two noodles: A vermicelli beef brisket noodle soup, and a satay beef home style friend noodle. The home style noodle actually tastes pretty good, similar to udon but a rougher texture. The vermicelli was...meh. It didn't seem to absorb very well with the soup, so when you chew it it tasted rather bland. I actually had to drink the soup base in order to get a bit of taste.

Drinks were surprisingly good, I actually liked the iced lemon tea here, and my dad was also satisfied with the iced milk tea.

Service was okay, but it wasn't busy when we went there so perhaps we got a bit more attention than some other reviews."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

A little hard to find and definitely smaller than the previous restaurant, but Golden Jade lives after being kicked out of the Silver Star plaza.

There's not a lot of parking spaces in here, but since this is the only restaurant establishment in a lot that's purely office units, it isn't really an issue. The restaurant itself is quite no frills; didn't seem to have many decorations at all. Either way, the prices make sense considering the food quantity and quality you get here.

I had the vermicelli with tomatoes and beef brisket in fish soup (if I remember correctly...it was one of their standalone specials in the menu). Either way, the portions are huge and the fish broth was tasty without it being fishy. The vermicelli was quite good, although overall I thought the diced tomatoes were of a lackluster quality. For the price I paid though I shouldn't complain much.

Service was good, most of the employees were the same ones as the previous Scarborough location.

My parents seem to like this place, so I'll likely return to try some other items.

{"text":"The owner of this restaurant has moved multiple times around Toronto but we have been following him because of the high quality of the food. 

My favourite dish here is the fried sticky rice with preserved sausage. The dish is not overly oily (usually you need a lot of oil for this dish) and the ingredients are all super high quality. 

Another dish that we always go back to is the fried oysters. The sweet sauce covering crispy fried oysters makes my mouth water every time. 

Service is always on point and you never feel pushed to order more than you need. 

Will keep coming back with my family"}
{"text":"I really like the food and the service there!

It's a bit pricey but it's worth it, they have some nice signature dishes and if you don't know what to start with the staff will help you to decide!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner! Had great portions with a creative twist to traditional Chinese dishes. The first two entrees included a whole duck and a whole chicken! We had two entrees of eel, huge oysters and other amazing dishes. Very flavourful and well balanced. They had lots of windows and the owner was very friendly."}
{"text":"The epitome of bad food. We were told by the owner to buy the steamed chicken which turned out to be cold served (ewwww), fried sticky rice which tastes no better than a regular fried rice I cook at home plus the owner was so very pushy in pushing their specialty noodles/minced meat dish which was flavourless. 

Albeit his claim that \"if you don't like it, you don't have to pay\", we still ended up were billed for it (although we clearly only ate a very small portion and had more than 80% of the dish leftover). 

$63 for just those 3 dishes plus a small side dish of Pork Hock? Insane!!!"}
{"text":"Golden Jade Restaurant just has this familiar feel to it: from the name, logo, menu items... 

Yes, it does remind me of Tsui Wah  http://www.yelp.ca/biz/tsui-wah-scarborough

Golden Jade though is a lot of stylish since it kept the similar deco and set up of the previous restaurant Lemongrass. 

As a Hong Kong Style Cafe it does deliver decent options for Breakfast/Lunch/Afternoon Tea option. For lunch (11-3) just order any Rice and Noodle item from the regular menu, you will receive a complimentary drink. 

Aside from various Soup Noodle Golden Jade are famous for, there are also some entree dishes you can order too, good for dinner!

I am still not sure what is Home Style \"Friend\" Noodle, I guess I have to give them a try.

Service though can be extremely slow and unorganized. I was standing in the front for over 5 minute with waitstaff walking by me and ignoring me... until I finally seat myself."}
{"text":"I had been to Golden Jade Restaurant when it was at Silverstar Blvd and I found it was OK. So no surprising my experience here at their location is similar.

The Afternoon Tea menu seems to have a more choices compares to the last time I visited.

Beef Brisket with Noodle and Choice of Drink ($6.50) is quite filling as it has good amount of protein and carbs. 

The restaurant itself can get a little stuffy with its sun room like set up. Great to have all these natural light from all the windows but they better has their AC on high during summer. 

Staff is nice and friendly. May worth coming by if you are in the area.

Cash Only."}
{"text":"Went here family of 4. Ordered 4 dishes, Pork Chop Spaghetti, Beef Tendon Vermicelli, Tea Time Ramen Noodles, and a beef noodle style soup. We all agreed at the end the food was too salty. There are better places around the area. Wouldn't come back."}
