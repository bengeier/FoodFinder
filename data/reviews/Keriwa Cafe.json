{"text":"Wonderful aboriginal-inspired restaurant at the edge of queen west. 
A great (but short) menu that offers a great selection of seasonal and wild ingredients. The menu is changed monthly.
Food is meant to be shared, tapas-style, and even though portions are on the small side almost every meal I've tried is good to great (I tried 9 items, out of ~15)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, but the wine list is incredibly bad. Kudos for trying to keep it local, but folks who spend this kind of dough for dinner expect to be able to pair the food with a good (at minimum) wine. The rosé and red we had were tasteless. Both. And they made the entire meal disappointing."}
{"text":"We had been stalking Keriwa Cafe since Foodstock and finally all 8 of us checked it out on a thursday night. I have to say that the service was superb- from following through with reservations, to the ursher, servers and finally the chef.   The menu wasn't 'overtly' Aboriginal but there were some interesting ingredients we had never heard of and our server was really great about explaining it to us. 

Everyone loved the red kife bread with our wines. 
Even though the food took over an hour to arrive (understandable with the large group), it was Superb! I had the duck breast with beans and the chef changed up the kale for me so that it was lactose free but very yummy! Everyone raved about their orders- bison ribs, duck confit, mushroom tart and braised bison pemmican. We ordered chocolate tart and poached pear for dessert which  were delicious. 

The decor is pretty but modern. A little bit more lighting  would be nice. Only recommendation would be to turn down the volume- the accoustic of the place already makes conversations seem louder, music just makes it impossible to talk.

I hope the issues are sorted out soon cause I can't wait to return here when they start the Brunch menu"}
{"text":"Went to Keriwa on Friday and had a great time.

Service was knowledgeable, friendly, and extremely precise, but I will say that it felt a bit formal for the neighbourhood.  I understand that some people want their servers in white shirts and aprons, and want to be \"served on the right\", and have every detail in their meal explained to them as it's sitting there, waiting to be eaten... but it seemed a bit fussy for me.  If the level of service is maintained without the formality, it would have been perfect.

Food was great - the cold corn soup was wonderful, the bison ravioli was delicious.  The whitefish app was good, but a bit bland... but overall an extremely delicious meal.

We also had a couple of cocktails that were delicious - would have liked to see a couple more beers on the menu, but wine looked well-chosen.

We'll go back soon!"}
{"text":"I went on the last night Keriwa Cafe was offering their a la carte menu. It is so rare to find a restaurant in Toronto that lives up to its hype. Delicious food and unexpected flavours; we should all be so lucky to eat food like this every once in a while.

The only disappointment was the chocolate cake. It just needed an extra chocolatey punch. But that was a small thing in comparison to the rest of the meal."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal in January at Keriwa Cafe. The confit pork belly was an absolutely delicious way to start off my meal followed by soul warming bison brisket, with a sauce resembling a gravy. My partner's pumpkin soup starter was wonderfully flavourful followed by the feature entree duck breast which was very nicely prepared, but wasn't as memorable.

Dessert of minced meat pie with an incredibly flaky crust was sensational - and I don't even like minced meat!

This was definitely the best meal I have had in a very long time! - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful evening there enjoying superlative meals. The meals were imaginatively and carefully prepared with attention to the beauty of the plated presentation. Lovely interior design - including the washrooms! We'd especially recommend the smoked whitefish, clams, bison and pavlova. And how do they get decaf espresso to taste so good? Staff was knowledgable and friendly. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Keriwa was good, but not that memorable. 

I liked the decor but thought the lights could have been dimmer when I came at dinner time. The servers' plaid shirts were a fun touch.

The food was good. Not as good as some other places, but interesting and tasty enough. If my memory serves me, we shared a duck crepe with greens on it. We told the server we were going to share everything and I had a conversation with my friend that we should avoid this one soup dish as it's not a good sharing item. We ordered a dumplings dish instead and I was surprised it turned out to be a clear broth soup with dumplings. It didn't say that on the menu and as discussed, it was kind of awkward to eat with another person! Perhaps the server could have warned us it was a soup dish and not steamed dumplings like we thought.

The last dish we ordered - the bison burger - took absolutely forever to arrive. The server did recognize this and gave us each a complimentary glass of wine. This was a nice recovery. 

I thought the food was a little overpriced considering the small portions we were served. The food itself was good, but not amazing. I'm not going to rush back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I came to the Keriwa Cafe with a group of friends and had no idea what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised, the Keriwa Cafe is very good.

The décor is trendy and modern, but with a native twist, that gives it more visual appeal.  The tables are nicely spaced and the walls are sparsely decorated with native inspired art and craft.  At the very end of the restaurant is a large open window looking right into the kitchen.  On either side of the window are long chalk boards to post the specials.  This seems to me like a chef's restaurant.

I had the Confit Trout Fritter appetizer and it is very good.  They were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside with the mild flavor of the trout shining through.  The with the fritters was delicious with sweet and sour notes from the fresh and pickled vegetables in it.  My friend had the chocolate tart with raspberry sorbet and it was also delicious.  Others had the oysters, the pie, the cheese plate, and the wine.

I made a point of telling the chef how good the food was and he took the time to talk with me for a few minutes and even take a picture.  I really appreciate it, especially because a chef in the kitchen rarely has time for that sort of thing.

The service was good but not great, it was our waitress' first day.  As a result she didn't know the menu all that well.  On the other hand, our drinks were refilled promptly and we were attended to quickly and courteously.

Lastly, the price was very reasonable for the quality of food.  I would have paid more for what I ate.   I would recommend the Keriwa Cafe and I would like to go again."}
{"text":"Being a set of nibblers, we ordered a few appetizers and a few mains all to share. Bison was the order of the day. Even with the majority of the menu NOT containing the hearty Canadian meat, three out of five of our dishes did. Like a few restaurants I've been to recently (is this the secret to knowing if you're in a great restaurant?), we were served a plate of complimentary bread, which came with raw unsalted butter, smoked sea salt (sooty and a bit like cracklin's- it's sounds gross, but it was incredible), and whipped pork fat (I don't even- like anise, sweet chili and cloying pork mousse).


The first thing to arrive was the Bison Tartar ($12). This was one of the recommendations from table AGO (thanks Victoria!), and it was such a strange thing. First, we got some more house bread, this time grilled into flat, crunchy toasts. I could tell there wouldn't be enough for the three of us, only because the tartar itself was very big. Remember, this is bison, which is very dense and filling- and there was probably a full cup of minced, raw steak on the plate! The taste of lovage was curious, as it's an herb I haven't had the pleasure of trying before. I found it similar to coriander, but not as powerful or as citrus. The tender meat abolished the need to butter the toast, it was incredibly juicy. I have had a love for raw red meat since trying a raw beef hand roll at Origin for one of my first reviews (so long ago, now!), and this elevated that love. It was so fresh, and the meat stood out so much, even studded with garlic scapes, sea asparagus, and baby chanterelles (all pickled, I think, since so much in other dishes was). There was a lot of natural pepper in the flavour, and the adobo was light and smoky, only a hint.


Next we  went for Bison Empanadas ($12). I think the theme of that evenings menu was Aboriginal with Spanish flare. The bison had a totally different approach from the tartar, and I personally was thrilled to see it's versatility. With a spice reminiscent of a Jamaican patty (understand I mean taken to a completely different level), the meat in the empanadas had a saucy, pulled texture rich with spice and some heat. The pastry scored big for me, it was almost like a dessert pie crust, flaky, solid. Because the dish was actually cold, and the grilled-then-chilled peach salsa piled on the side was incredibly sweet, I really felt like this was dessert. Meat and sweet, but oddly, like dessert. Just a bit of arugula kept this from being too rich.

Surprise surprise, the next dish was..BISON! This time something very true to Canadian roots, Braised Bison Pemmican ($14), with Saskatoon berries. I very quickly mistook them for blueberries, and raved about how small and adorable and hard they were, and what a strong flavor! Foolish Katherine. They are not blueberries, though with a smoky skin, they look very similar. Like the meat, they had been dried enough to be chewy. Here the bison had the same kind of pulled texture as the empanadas we just finished, but drier. The taste was COMPLETELY different, incomparable. Smokey with an undercurrent of cinnamon sweetness, the pemmican was way more gamey than the other dishes. It was also super tender, and caused many eyes to roll in ecstasy. If they have this on the menu again take my word and order it. You will thank yourself. You will thank Keriwa. With it came a little salad of sour pickles (bean, spicy radish?) on greens, and some AMAZING fry bread! The fry bread was chewy and crisp, sprinkled with the smoky sea salt we got to try with our bread and butter starter. It was not absorbent, but made to have meat piled on top. I think there was more of that cinnamon undercurrent.


Moving on from our orgiastic enjoyment of red, tender bison, came a dish of Rainbow Trout ($23). It was a delicately perched slab of fish, carried by a palanquin of roasted heirloom tomatoes and squash. Skin is so important on a fish. This wasn't blackened or crackled, simply seared, keeping its fatty elasticity. The clear taste of a freshwater fish was untainted by unnecessary accouterments. The tomatoes were incredibly sweet, almost as strong as if they had been sun dried, and dripped with a puree of basil and oil. Like an exotic treat, a ricotta stuffed, tempura-battered squash blossom topped the lot. It was hard to split, and I wanted it all to myself. The vegetable armour provided just enough body.

Even though I had been eyeballing a towering piece of peach pie topped with a scoop of ice cream at the table next to ours, we were getting stuffed. Did I mention how very filling Bison is? Even with so little, it had us feeling packed, and we finished off on a refreshing note of Beet Salad with Hazelnuts ($11). It is possible to describe a salad as fun, and it is possible because it contained potato chips. Yes. Little baby potatoes must have been finely mandolined into slivers to fry, no more than two centimeters in diameter."}

What a lucky girl I was born to be, to be taken to the lovely Keriwa Cafe for my birthday! Hopping on the streetcar and venturing a bit more west than I am accustomed to going, my SO led me to this quiet, nicely decorated joint. The place was not too packed but there were a lot of reservations that trailed in after us. I would have loved to say it was a 4-star experience overall, but what started off at a 4 dropped to barely a 3 by the end of the night. 

Drinks: I opted for a glass of red, but my SO ordered chocolate martini of sorts. I am not usually a big fan of creamy drinks nor anything sweet - especially not with dinner - but it was surprisingly yum and not heavy. I would love another one right about now....

Food: We ordered the Roasted Beet Salad which was average, the Smoked Trout (5/5), the Confit Pork Belly (5/5) and the ravioli (2/5) to share. The trout and pork belly was absolutely delicious - we couldn't get enough. Recommend to the max.

Where they started losing stars was after the appetizers. We were really looking forward to the ravioli but there was possibly a 30-40 minute gap between our appetizers and the ravioli. Furthermore, the servers were unaware of the delay and also were unapologetic when it finally came. Not sure if the wait negatively skewed my tastebuds but it was not worth the wait.

Overall, I did enjoy my experience there a whole lot since my taste buds were still tickled to happiness and I was in good company. It was just the unfortunate delay in the kitchen/forgotten order that dampened our meal there.

Atmosphere - 5/5
Service - 3/5
Food - 4/5
Price - 3/5"}
{"text":"I came with a group of friends on a Tuesday. We had a mixture of dishes, including the cabbage rolls for our vegans and rainbow trout for the meat eaters. Everything was delicious and beautifully plated. 

The warm atmosphere with woodsy smell was almost better than the food! Despite the menu being a bit higher in price, the restaurant made you feel comfortable and casual. The staff was lovely and never rushed us; they even let us stay and chat after our meal was over. 

All of my friends have raved about this place and plan to go back soon. Delicious."}
{"text":"This place has quickly became one of my top restaurant picks in Toronto. It's not very conveniently located, but it's worth the special trip to the very end of Queen St. West. Make reservations because the queue quickly spills outside. I like it here because the chef seems to know everyone and there's a community vibe to it. You can easily see the intensity and passion for their craft in the open kitchen. The space is a bit smoky but it's a good way because it's a woodsy-spicy scent.

The menu changes with what's in season, so you can find something new to try each time. The cold soups are great and unique. The fish has always been impeccable. I like the oysters too. I wish they'd serve the fruit pavlova dessert ALL THE TIME. It's my favourite of all time. Love it!"}
{"text":"So writing this review as we wait for our appetizer. So far very smoky inside - ventilation needs work. 3 white wine options one of which they were out of already - strange for a 7pm seating on a Saturday night. The bison app arrives and it's strange, different, small portion but extremely delicious. Incredible smoke smell on the bison and interesting mix of textures with the goat cheese, wheat berries and this jelly like substance. Dinner was incredible - I had the chicken he had the pickerel. Many complex layers and flavored perfectly balanced. Will come back and definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I was greatly anticipating dining here and I was not disappointed. Over the years, it has occurred to me that Canada has a great gastronomic history that remains untapped. When I heard about Keriwa Cafe and its aboriginal-inspired menu, it immediately went on my To-Eat list. The menu was not extensive but offered a good variety of dishes. The food was exquisite and features local and seasonal meats, vegetables and fruit. I had the braised bison ravioli, which was incredible. Great cocktails and an Ontario-inspired wine list. If available, you HAVE to try the peach/nectarine pie."}
{"text":"I think it's tough to have a great food experience when the service is clearly bad.  Coffees came out 15 minutes later and they said that they were on the house but ended up charging me for it anyway.  It wasn't a huge deal but numerous times we had to ask for things twice- coffee, ketchup, jam... Soup was super sweet and for some reason my poached eggs on my Benedict were overcooked, bacon was bland.... I think all these things would have been tolerable if the service was good but it wasn't so I will probably not go back."}
{"text":"We visited Keriwa Cafe based on a recommendation for food that represented Canada. We ordered two apps (fresh oysters from NB, confit pork belly), one veg (fiddleheads), and two mains (smoked hen, bison shortrib). The food was excellent, fresh and expertly prepared. Chef Aaron Joseph Bear Robe's experience in balancing flavours shows. One blemish on the whole night was the service. Albeit with reservation and an empty restaurant at 6pm, we felt rushed through the meal. My partner's dishes were busted as soon as her fork returned to the plate, I had not finished mine. She told us about the dessert before I finished my main. And the bill showed up unprompted. When we left, there were empty tables and nobody waiting for our table."}
{"text":"i treated my native friend for her birthday.. we arrived just as the restaurant was opening and they told us we may have to eat at the bar! i stated that their website said they accept walk-ins and the restaurant was not full yet. they accommodated us at a table but stated: will you be gone by 7pm?! geez thanks for making us feel so welcome! by the end of our time there the restaurant was only half full so we did not take anyone's table!!

the food was absolutely delicious!! the service was ok.. the server was knowledgeable but did not check in on us very often.. i feel the prices are a little over inflated for how much food you get on your plate.. 

now the impression i have from their website and all the write ups is that it is a native inspired restaurant.. interior wise we never would have known that except for some birch bark on the walls.. and when my friend came back from the washroom she had a weird look on her face and she said to me: are you going to the washroom? well that made me go to the washroom.. then i understood why.. the prints on the wall in the hallway leading to the washrooms were at first glance someone in native dress.. but then when you look closer you realize it's european.. so for a restaurant that portrays itself as native inspired.. maybe they could me more considerate of our native heritage when doing so. 

this is a once-of experience for me.. if someone else was treating me for my birthday i would go back for the food but not the restaurant itself."}
{"text":"I just got an email from Keriwa saying that as of October 13, 2012, they will be switching from à la carte meals to a tasting menu. I'm looking forward to eating there again once they make the switch."}
{"text":"We decided to go on a Saturday night after reading great reviews here on Yelp and because of the close proximity to our place. We were seated without reservations (which they take! Glad to see!)

The decor is beautiful and modern Canadiana, with some nostalgic touches (the framed dress was owned by the chef's grandmother). We started our meal with some cocktails and from this point the service took a turn for the worse. 

Nothing was quite timed right. We were often waiting for things. The restaurant missed several opportunities to up-sell us on more drinks. Our cocktails were empty when the appetizers came, but we weren't asked if we wanted more drinks. We asked for wine when they took our dinner order, and it didn't come until after we had started eating.

Nothing came unless we asked. No one asked if we needed anything or made suggestions - which was frustrating when hearing such great service to surrounding tables. We heard a neighbouring table raving about the bread, which hadn't been offered to us. We asked our server, and he cluelessly mumbled that he forgot, brining us some near the end of our mains.

And of course, when you notice bad service, you begin to notice all the things your waiter is doing when they're keeping you waiting. When we asked for a wine menu, we watched him go to the bar, casually chat to the chef for a while through the window at the back, before coming back to grab the wine list for us 10 minutes later (which was within reaching distance from us the whole time).

Every course was fantastic - some of the best food I've ever had in the city. My gazpacho was flavourful with heirloom tomatoes, amazing texture from the sunflower seeds, with a bit of kick from some jalapeno. My partner's smoked whitefish appetizer was delicious, and we both called the accompanying mushrooms the best part of the meal. 

We both had the grilled trout, which was perfectly cooked - served with fresh tomatoes and basil, with a lightly battered deep-fried zucchini blossom. 

Because the food was amazing, we were interested in desert. Again, our empty plates were taken and we had to call over someone else to tell us about dessert. We ordered the apple pie and asked to see a drink menu for an aperitif. Our waiter brought us a wine list (which we'd already seen, and didn't include the desert drinks we were interested in after hearing a different waiter describe them as the perfect accompaniment to our dessert to a different table) and he disappeared until our desert was nearly gone - again missing a sales opportunity. (the Apple pie was fantastic, BTW, but overshadowed by our impatience and disappointment that no one had come back to take our order for the delicious spiced calvados that we heard our neighbouring table again raving about).

I'll definitely be back - as I was so impressed with the food. Kudos to the chef! Again, it was one of the best meals I've had in this city. I hope they get their front of house sorted out though. For a quiet night (we counted 6 tables) and the prices charged, I expect more."}
{"text":"Again, I am coming off my review moratorium to tell you all about a wicked new spot in Parkdale!  When someone asks you the question \"what is Canadian food?\" you no longer have to sit there confused and answer with \"poutine\".  Send them over to Keriwa and all will be revealed...

1. This place is virtually brand new, but the atmosphere and buzz feels like it's been apart of the neighbourhood for years.  It feels like they've carved out an identity already.  Maybe it's because the seating capacity is pretty limited and it feels more intimate, I dunno.

2. Whenever possible, all the ingredients are sourced locally -- while in season.

3. Some of the best cocktails in town.  The attention to detail while crafting these things is incredible.  Many original concoctions.

4. Oysters, smoked whitefish app, and bison tail.  All winners.  And yes, Bonnie D. is right; the peach/nectarine pie is one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten.  Just get it.

5. From my understanding, this is a start up from a couple of people from Splendido, so it doesn't surprise me at all that the food and drinks are this good.  Also as expected, the service is top notch.

Overall, this is such a great new spot in the city.  If it wasn't for being broke, I'd eat here all the time.  I highly recommend this place...definitely check it out before the buzz gets around."}
{"text":"Went here last night with some friends for dinner.  We called around 8:30pm and they were able to squeeze us in for a table at 9pm- and we're so glad!  We had a wonderful experience and would highly recommend!

Everything at the resto was top-notch, from the drinks to the food to the service to the decor.  
-Drinks: We ordered  round of drinks and we loved every drop from 
-Food: Loved the nettle soup, bison pemmican, chicken, bison entree.  Even the special order veggie entre was interesting and delicious (it involved fiddleheads, bannock, rutabaga and other tasty treats).  Only complaint would be that neither dessert (carrot cake and pavlova) was particularly notable. 
-Service: Our server was efficient, charming,and knowledgeable. Two of us asked for the server to have the chef surprise us and she handled the request deftly.  I asked for a vegetarian menu and she graciously handled that request too!
-Decor: Loved the artwork, the barshelves, the bathroom decor.  It was chic with personality.  

Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Good God! Who died and made this place Best of 2012! Was there bribery involved? Sigh ...and can i give them 0 stars out of 5? I wish! 

We decided to book this for a girl's night out for a 9pm seating, meaning the dinner rush would likely have died off a bit at least part way through our service but it hadn't.

Immediately upon getting seated, we ordered a glass of vino and two cocktails, mine, the Parkdalian tasted a bit like medicine - gross. Anyway, not entirely sure why but it took them 45 minutes just to bring our drinks and not because they realized that our drinks were well overdue but rather because, and note this would be our 1st polite attempt, we flagged to the waitress that desperate in need of our bevies, they were no where to be found. She apologized and brought them over.

Bad first impression, we ordered the cheese plate, something like $5 for a half ounce or something complicated, who knows what a half ounce of cheese looks like?!? And I think some pork belly dish. To avoid any further waste of time we also ordered our entrees, one of us had the Dumplings and the rest of us had some bison dish. Surprise! No appetizers arrived and again we had to flag this and only then did the waitress apologize about losing the ticket or something ... what? Come and ask and we'll tell you again what we ordered. 

The cheese was delicious but then again I think St. Lawrence Market has good cheese too ;) And the pork belly or whatever else it is that we ordered left me thinking that it was super fatty and gross ... a good chef can mask the fat with deliciousness and this wasn't the case. 

Fairly disappointed at portion size we were already making plans about going to McDonald's, and our entrees arrived. The bison dish was mooshed up slimely and what I would call sort of like ground beef in sheppard's pie and came in a ravioli (no mention of that ravioli) with an overbearing amount of ingredients and what I would called an episode of Iron Chef or Chopped with secret random ingredients gone wrong. The duck dumplings according to my friend were good but really the portion was ridic! Two dumplings in a bowl the size of one similar to miso soup at a Sushi restaurant? Hello McDonald's! 

Aside from the dumplings, everything we ordered came with some berry jam and okay maybe this is the aboriginal way but really does it have to be on absolutely everything?!? FML!

Out of principle I didn't want to order dessert but my friend's insisted that we had already sunk this much time into it and that they were still hungry and that dessert would have to be part of the night ... so we ordered two desserts - something similar to an apple pie and a wild rice pudding + coffee. 

The coffee arrived immediately - was good but the dessert ... the waitress came and asked \"how was dessert\" ... are you kidding? What dessert!!!!

I had asked for the chef / owner but she was so frazzled she left that unattended and took care of dessert and the first round of drinks for us and despite that we each spent $60 - which I don't think is acceptable for service or food of this quality.  To top it off the kitchen was chatting and preoccupied slacking off vs. attending to the food tickets.

I highly discourage anyone from going here and am disappointed. I don't know if it was just us that got nailed with bad food and horrible service but to give some cred ... the dessert was the best part ... so maybe if you wanna give this a try you go for dessert - the wild rice pudding was delicious."}
{"text":"Canadian Smoke House knows how to please this foodie.
Its recent top 7 finish as best new restaurant in Canada definitely got my attention.  Decor is funky rustic. I like it.
Service: Warm and welcoming. Free sparkling or distilled water. No pressure to push liquor. Very civilized.
Told they specialized in Smoked dishes. Has in house smoker using Cherry and Apple wood chips. Dishes are tapas style - good for sharing.
Order the following:
Bison Jowls - mash potatos with dijon tasty  Slow cooked jarls the most flavourful part of meat. Similar sour flavour sauce to the soup. (4+ stars)
Smoked Trout - Parsley wrapped smoked Trout. Tender. taste of smoke comes through - brings back memories of the best smoke houses in Vancouver Island 1st nations. Mushroom (2 types (1 smoked and 1 not) and the creme completes the dish. 5 stars.
Soup - nuts ( not fond of texture) tamarind but is Quince very SE asian indo tatse unsure. each scoop improves. must be the sour spicy that draws me in.  3.5 stars
Overall I would give Keriwa a strong 4++ star. I will definitely bring my clients with me next time."}
{"text":"I was not sure what to expect with my first meal at Keriwa Cafe. Ive never eaten at an Aboriginal Canadian restaurant before. The thoughts were crossing my mind of tasting all sorts obscure ingredients just for the sake of being \"different\". It turned out to be absolutely delicious! The cocktail and oysters we had to start were fantastic. The oysters came with a little apple topping which I was sceptical about, but ended up complimenting the fresh oysters perfectly. The cocktail menu is quite well constructed with a great variety of fresh and unique flavours on offer. Very alcoholic though (which wasn't a problem). Ask the wait staff what the specials are.

The main of Bison Shortrib was tender, full of flavour, juicy and came with a complimentary variety of purée flavours and a risotto. The servings are small so I would recommend getting some sides to fill it out a little. Bison is a new meat for me, being from Australia, but I am a convert after eating this meal.

Overall the meal was pleasant, the service attentive, but maybe a little on the \"snooty\" side, and the original flavour combinations very pleasing on the palette. Pricing is a little on the high end so make sure you get someone else to pay for you. Great restaurant, good drinks, decent food. Worth checking out if you're looking for a menu that is a little different, but prepared and served deliciously."}
{"text":"I was waiting with anticipation from April when I heard this restaurant was going to open. We my husband and son) were able to eat here the second night it was opened. The service was excellent . My son who works in the service industry indicated that what impressed him was the team approach. If any staff walked by and noticed a need at the table they dealt with it rather than waiting for our server. The food was excellent. The sourdough bread with smoked salt was amazing. We had starters of oysters with 3 excellent accompanying sauces. Watermelon and tomato salad  was refreshing with yogurt dressing and lightly toasted pumpkin seed.  The cold roasted corn soup was a must have.
Our entrees included bacon wrapped white fish, bison sirloin and polenta,and grilled vegetable tart. We ended by sharing the flour-less chocolate torte. The wine was also excellent. We look forward to eating here frequently, and I for one am so pleased that Toronto finally has a restaurant that features aboriginal inspired cuisine."}
{"text":"Simply put, this was one of the best meals I've ever had.  Front to back it was amazing.  The food is Aboriginal-inspired, local, seasonal and utterly delicious! 

I started with the Spring Spinach Salad served with beets, apples, walnuts, topped with a perfectly poached egg.  It was light and savoury with great contrasts of tastes and textures.  Amazing.

Entree was the Bison Scottish Clod Tenderloin with eggplant, red peppers, wild leeks and Yorkshire pudding stuffed with bison tongue... I am now a fan of bison tongue... at least when they prepare it.

And for dessert my dinner mates and I shared the Spring Pavlova with rhubarb, mint,elderberry, huckleberry.  I'd never tried Pavlova before.  It was a light, tart and the perfect way to finish.

Their menu changes monthly which gives me a great excuse to go there every month.  They have two seatings a night, 6 and 9, but are pretty flexible if you want to push that time 15 minutes one way or another."}
{"text":"TLDR; wonderful food, poor service, and just OK drinks.

FOOD

The food here is wonderful. The flavor profiles are unique and new, something I hadn't had before. I appreciated them. 

I also love that there are a bunch of 'snacks' made for sharing with the table. Many of the dishes we received were portioned into three, which was perfect for our group of three. 

More specifically:
Pork Belly Confit - melt in your mouth good, and a very nice crust. There was some pig face prosciutto-type stuff that was also surprisingly good.

Smoked Hen - a great smokiness to it, though this was our least favorite dish. I really liked the puree at the bottom.

Asparagus - well-cooked, and with a yummy egg topping.

Steamed Peanuts - very good and unique. This was the most \"aboriginal\" in our mind of the dishes we tried. It came out inside a nice wooden canoe. 

Bison Burger - very good, especially the toasted bread it was served on. There was some extremely mean sauce on that bread. 

Venison Sausage - absolutely delicious. They cut it into three pieces which was perfect for our group. The meat was cooked perfectly and just melted in your mouth. I wish this was the \"sausage\" you got at a ballpark.

They were out of the Bison short ribs that we were very much looking forward to, but the deliciousness of the other food made up for it.

SERVICE

Three of us went to Keriwa on a Wednesday evening, only to find that there was just one waitress and one chef working the restaurant. Despite our trepidations, we went ahead with the meal.

Unfortunately, 1 hour and 45 minutes into the meal, we had only received two of the dishes listed above - despite ordering them all at the beginning given we know service was going to be slow. The waitress had also not asked us how we had liked our food.

We understood why the service was slow, but we would still have liked Keriwa to staff more people so we could enjoy the wonderful food more fully.

DRINKS

The Bear Lobe is a very bitter drink. 

The glass of Pinot Gris was stale; it seemed the bottle had been left open for a few days. 

The sparkling was pretty good.

My friends enjoyed their cocktails. I think they had the margarita and something else-it was sweet.

The beer keg for the beer my friend was drinking ran out, so they gave him a half-glass on the house.

Overall, a great place - especially if they improve their service."}
{"text":"A truly spectacular restaurant.

The pork confit was one of the best dishes I've EVER had the pleasure of eating.   Not just this week.   Not just this year.   EVER.

A feast for the senses, from the art on the walls to the wonderful scent of burning wood that permeates the comfortable room.

A place where dinner feels like a truly unique experience.   

Like nowhere you've been in the city."}
{"text":"Best food I have ever had!

The service was excellent. The menu small, but unique and enticing (also changed monthly to keep in season). 
The food came out at a good pace and was cooked to absolute perfection. I can't put into words how well all the flavors were paired on our plates. Once we started eating all conversation ended and became a series of 'oh god', 'wow', and 'you have to try this'. Honestly, everything just melted on our tongues. 

I will not be surprised if this place get increasingly difficult to get a seat in, it is that good. 

Can't wait to go back next month with a new menu to try more things from their amazing chef."}
{"text":"I have a doppelganger, and she is a professional food writer. This Yelp review is dedicated to Gizelle Lau. Thank you. 

Came here for brunch, party of four. They don't take reservations for brunch, but we were able to snag a table, no problem. As we perused the menu, we admired the rustic decor and quirky light fixtures. Our server brought us water and told us about the specials, which included a salmon eggs benny and homemade red fife donuts dusted in sugar. 

We ordered the donuts to share. They were delicious, bite-size wonders... Like really fancy timbits! We were pleasantly surprised when the server brought out a basket of pastries on the house. It included mini croissants, a berry scone, muffin, and ginger snap cookies. Everything was warm out of the oven and divine. They were served with some fresh fruit preserves. I only wished there was a bit more, because it came in a tiny dish that was a bit tricky to share between 4. 

For mains, I went with the smoked whitefish dill crepe, which was served on a wooden slab with creme fraiche, hen of the woods (mushrooms, not poultry!), and some caviar garnish. It was a small portion, so I'd suggest ordering it with a side or a starter. The crepe was just lovely. It was light and flavourful without being overpoweringly fishy. I had a bite of my DC's confit pork belly -- melt-in-your-mouth goodness. Other DC's had the eggs benny and duck confit on cinnamon bun bread pudding. Both looked amazing and received thumbs up from my DC's. 

At this point, we were pretty full and all agreed that this was the best brunch we've had in a long time (and we go out for brunch a lot!). The dishes are creative and interesting, while ingredients are organic and locally-sourced. 

Our server cleared our plates (which we had all licked clean!) and set out new cutlery. This was a bit puzzling, but we didn't think much of it. Then she returned with another dish that \"the kitchen sent over\" for us -- bison pemmican (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemmican) pasta. They were like dumplings in a light broth with kale, almonds, elderberry, and popped red fife (a heritage bread wheat). Omg, this was amazing... The red fife really added a unique flavour and texture, and the pasta itself was comfort food for a cold, wintery day. It turns out that this is a starter from their dinner menu. Get this if you are here for dinner in February, before the menu changes next month! 

Now, we were reeeally full after such a satisfying brunch. Our server comes back: \"I hope you saved room, because we've got dessert coming!\" We thought they'd send over one thing, but they actually brought out all 3 of their dessert options: screech cake, a gelato trio, and crème brûlée. They were all fantastic, but the latter was the winner for me. 

The whole situation was quite mysterious, until the sous chef came to our table to ask how the food was. Then he looks at me -- \"you're Gizelle Lau right?\" Uhhh... Although part of me was thinking, 'for food this incredible, I can be whoever you want me to be'... my conscience got the better of me and I told the truth (we googled her promptly, and found that she is a food writer who contributes to Toronto Life, WHERE, and other publications). I felt like I had disappointed everyone... but as a consolation, I left a \"You've Been Yelped\" card on the table and am writing this review. We left a big tip and apologized about the identity confusion as we left. Perhaps it was the fact that I was snapping pics on my phone and talking to my friends about star-ratings (as I was planning my Yelp review) that threw them for a loop. Maybe my friends should start calling me 'Gizelle' in public. 

That said, I honestly would've given Keriwa Cafe 5 stars even without the sweet freebies! And although, we were given special treatment, I did see the sous chef go to other tables to chat and ask how people liked their food. You can bet we'll be back soon to try their dinner menu!

(Update: looks like the real Gizelle liked it too! http://www.postcity.com/Eat-Shop-Do/Eat/February-2012/Cheap-Eat-of-the-Week-Keriwa-Cafes-brunch-basket/)"}
{"text":"Ok, so the food here is as fabulous as most of the reviews have been raving about. I ordered the rainbow trout that came with scalloped potatoes, beet bulbs and chard... the fillet was cooked perfectly, flaky and moist and the potatoes... I mean, there are scalloped potatoes, and then there are SCALLOPED potatoes. Mmmmm....however the chef made the cream sauce, it had me scraping the plate (surreptitiously, of course ;-)) with my fork... 

Our table had also ordered the duck breast, the duck confit, the bison short ribs - and for dessert, we had the chocolate tart, and the poached pear (with chocolate ice cream). I don't think I've ever seen the entire table finish a meal that quickly - not because we were in a hurry to get out of there but because no one could really talk while eating :) 

We were seated near the chef's window - so it was awesome to see him in action. Of course, being the foodaholics our group was, one of my friends asked if we could meet the chef and he graciously came out, chit chatted and took a picture with us :) 

The total -- including wine and tip - came to about $480 for a group of 8. Totally reasonable, especially given the quality and presentation of the food, the service and given extra desserts ! :) 

The place is new, but definitely a keeper in my book :)"}
{"text":"My first and most amazing meal at Keriwa feels like it was ages ago. All that I can really remember from that time is their fantastic old fashioned and literally melt-in-your-mouth bone-in beef rib appetizer. After that experience, there were a number of only slightly less memorable, but consistently excellent dinners of mostly fish dishes before Keriwa dropped off my radar.

In hindsight, their venture into untouchable $300/person, once a week only, table d'hote territory only served to work up an even larger appetite. I'm really glad that things are back to normal now and was very pleased with my most recent meal of smoked fish, duck dumplings, and drinks made by the guest bartender, Kevin Brauch, a.k.a. the Thirsty Traveler. 

My only complaints would be that the room was distractingly smokey (to me, but not my date) and the wait time between starters and mains was lengthier than normal. However, these issues were nothing that a couple of their well-made drinks and the interesting flavours of their brussels sprouts with pears didn't remedy. The food and service were great as expected."}
{"text":"A group of us went to Keriwa Cafe on a Saturday night with great expectations, especially after being written up in the Globe & Mail. We were very excited to try something new and were pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the resto with the cool decor, nestled in a very unique neighbourhood.

The service, to say the least, was terrible right from the get-go. Our server took quite a long time to take our drink orders, and forgot 2 people's drink orders twice - to which we had to keep repeatedly asking. After finally receiving the entire drink order, it took her an additional 20 minutes or so to bring the menus, and over half an hour to take our dinner orders. As a previous review, nothing was quite timed right. We waited a very long time for our appetizers, and received our mains approximately 45 minutes after finishing the first course. We brought this to the attention of our server, to which she replied that it really wasn't that long between courses, instead of acknowledging the delays between meals. 

The reviews from our group: As for the appetizers, the beet salad was wonderful, as was the pork belly confit. As for the mains: we had decent expectations of the pheasant and bison. The pheasant was overcooked and dry. The bison dish: the bison was prepared well, however the potatoes seemed like they had been cooking all night and were exceptionally dry. The red pepper coulis that accompanied the meat was a rather odd pairing and could have been done differently. It was a less than mediocre dish in everyone's opinion who ordered both courses. 

All in all, due to the poor service, coordination and timing, I would not recommend this restaurant, nor would I go back. Our dinner started at 9:30, and ended at 1am because of the delays from the server and the kitchen - in the entire group's opinion, this took far too long.The server could have handled our table better and taken into consideration our table's feedback about the delay between courses as opposed to telling us there wasn't a long wait time for anything. For the price point and quality of our meal, it wasn't a match. It was definitely overpriced for the quality of the food and service."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight with friends and it was AMAZING.  I LOVE this place.  The wait staff was excellent but the food was something VERY special.  We tried most things and shared our food so there isn't anything I can say about this place except it is wonderful."}
{"text":"Reading through the reviews, I'm not alone in having had \"one of the best meals I've ever had\" experiences c/o Keriwa.  The food here has made a unique and lasting impression.  

The bread we were served was extremely flavorful--molasses and some other flavours that contributed to a nice bittersweet taste--and came with some butter, fancy salt, and a hummus-y condiment whose description I can't remember.  

I had the pork belly appetizer and bfffff got the bison.  The pork belly was an unexpected mix of flavours--it was a new experience.  There were pieces of popcorn peppering the mix of sauces, (I think) hazelnuts, greens, etc.  The popcorn obviously looked strange, but on tasting the melange of flavours it absolutely worked.  It was a surprise and delight to eat.  Bf's bison app was also completely delicious: the bison was sliced very thinly and again the different textures and flavours were so interesting and tasty.

For entrees, I got the lamb shoulder and the Mr. got pickerel.  The lamb was unreal--so soft and moist.  I wish I had more to say about it but by that point in the meal I was in some weird state of gustatory hyperstimulation, like the taste-bud version of those weird visuals at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  

The service was fine--not overly friendly but prompt and timing between courses was perfect. 

The food here is so thoughtfully put together; the combinations are inspired!  I  will probably be cramming Keriwa recommendations down everyone's throats for a long time to come.  Go!"}
{"text":"If you needed another reason to love Parkdale, here's one: it's quickly establishing itself as the epicentre of gourmet, locally-sourced cuisine in Toronto, with top-notch chefs at Atlantic, Local Kitchen, Cowbell, and now Keriwa Cafe.  With all, the emphasis is on local and seasonal ingredients, deftly prepared to capitalize on intrinsic freshness and flavour.  Keriwa is an absolute standout in this regard: honestly some of the most exquisite food I've had in Toronto at any price.  I was impressed that the chef inquired about any dietary restrictions at the table, so that adjustments could be made.  (Lesser chefs in Toronto print on their menus that they will *not* make adjustments.)   The appetizer of smoked whitefish in dill crepes with 'hen of the woods' mushrooms managed to be light yet earthy.  The rainbow trout, served with heirloom tomatoes and pureed basil, was perfectly cooked.  Everything was beautifully presented on plates made from rustic slabs of wood. For dessert we had the spiced apple pie with vanilla ice cream, which tasted genuinely homemade--  really large slice by the way, so plan to share this if you try it.  Keriwa also offers some delicious & novel cocktails.  The table service left a little to be desired, though not for lack of ambition.  They seemed keen to explain menu options and consult on wines etc., but this kept them too busy to attend to the basics. It won't stop me from returning for more of this amazing food."}
{"text":"The food was good, interesting and original. But, the wine list very limited and expensive plus the sound level was not acceptable. In addition, the service was efficient but cold."}
