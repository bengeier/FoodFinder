{"text":"Went here with a date, who was a regular there, so he ordered for me.  For drinks, he ordered me a plum wine, that was delish! We then had calamari for an appetizer, and I was instantly hooked! It was the best calamari I had EVER had! He also ordered sushi, and I guess I'm just not a sushi fan. He loved it, but me...no thanks.  Next he ordered me the sesame chicken, and rice. Let's just say, it's my new favorite. I always order it when I go there! The chicken was seasoned just right, and the sauce was amazing! I love it!! I didn't have room for dessert, but the entree was good enough for me!  Our waiter was extremely nice and the service was great! The place is not the biggest, but the atmosphere and ambiance that you get is so relaxing. It's not loud, messy or crowded, and that I loved. The crowd was mainly business people from uptown.   I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and atmosphere! However, their regular food isn't all that great. The sesame chicken isn't actual sesame chicken; it's just fried chicken with ginger sauce on top. The teriyaki style food is alright.  Also, the last time I ate there, all of the waitresses and hostesses were sitting around on their phones while we waited for service which didn't look good. Definitely recommend Room 112 if you just want sushi"}
{"text":"Was not impressed what so ever. 92 sanitation score scared me to order anything past an appetizer. Ordered a 11$ cocktail only for waitstaff to walk by and take it off the table. At first she asked if it was water or tea and I said \"no it's a cocktail\" and she took the glass with about two and a half inches left and walked away. Highly disappointed because it was a great drink. Waiter was very inattentive. Took 40 minutes for us to order, get our drinks, get an appetizer, and another 20 minutes to flag someone down to pay. Meanwhile people were chatting at the register, tables were dirty, and the place wasn't even half way full. My boy friend and I wanted to try something new in Charlotte for our anniversary, we should have stayed home."}
{"text":"Came in here hoping for some yummy sushi and was not disappointed.  Loved the volcano roll!  My parents, who were a little nervous about sushi, ordered rice dishes and loved them too. In fact, got them a crispy california roll which they loved, and couldnt keep them away from my volcano.  Great food and very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Things have changed. It's bad now. The food tastes like it was just heated up from frozen with prebottled sauce. So, so sad! It was my favorite.   Review from 2013:  I am a hibachi shrimp expert. I have tried it hundreds of times in countless restaurants and states. And this. Was. The best. I've ever. Had.  Takeout options are available, but no delivery yet. Still, the chicken finger style sesame chicken or zingy, flavorful curry rice is worth the visit. We ate here twice in one week and I'm already dreaming of more.  If you dine in, the atmosphere is cozy and cool with lots of reds. Our server was polite and brought the food to the table hot."}
{"text":"Our waitress acted like we were a bother for her. She wouldn't get our dirty plates off the table, didn't ask if we needed any more drinks after our only beer we ordered. We had to go get our own plates once the sushi came out and finally just brought us out the bill without asking if we needed anything else. Food was pretty good but service needed work. I know people can have a rough day but you have to shake it off for your customers sake."}
{"text":"Great food and staff!! Fresh sushi for me, Ichiban roll was delicious!! Sea Bass dish for date and he said very good. Sopporo and hot Saki available to drink. Staff super friendly and suggested other night life places to check out. A little hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Sushi was good and reasonable! Service was pretty good, but food took forever to get to us! We had a larger group (8 people) and ordered a good amount of sushi, but it did take a good amount of time! The ambiance is awesome!"}
{"text":"This was very good Sushi. The restaurant is small and not fancy, but delightful. It is in a great part of downtown, across from the Omni, where we are staying, and 1 block from the Time Warner Arena. From the moment we walked in the door, we felt welcomed. Our server was pleasant and, most if all, attentive. The menu has all the standard Sushi selections, plus special rolls and a large variety of cooked dishes, including stir fry items. They also have a full bar. The prices are very fair for the portion size and quality, and were far more reasonable than we expected to see in a large city. We started with the soft shell crab appetizer...excellent! We then had a Volcano and Cherry Blossom Roll, and Salmon Sushi. The salmon was delicious and fresh, the rolls yummy and nicely presented. Nice neighborhood gem in Charlotte. We will definitely revisit on our next trip to town."}
{"text":"When I moved to Charlotte a few months back, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to enjoy good sushi when a craving came over. Luckily, Room 112 fits the bill. I've tried other options in Uptown such as Enso, Red Ginger, Emzy, and Fujo. Room 112 is the best, by far.   A few of my favorite rolls are their Spicy Tuna, Spider, and Pink Floyd. Their spring rolls are awesome too so I always have one of those. I'm getting hungry as I write this.. Need. Sushi. Now. Please.  It's a low key spot. It's not fancy, nor does it try to be. It also doesn't play loud, obnoxious music (thanks Enso). It's simple and authentic, but delicious! Next time you're craving sushi after work, or in Uptown, ignore all other options and head to this place."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Great ambience.  Attentive staff.  Who could ask for more?  Definitely recommend!  Try the pink Floyd roll"}
{"text":"There was a bearded waiter and he was pathetic .. worst customer experience ever .. the lady in the reception was also the same .. unwelcoming and pathetic .. I love the food but it was a terrible experience"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and it has been excellent every time. The innovative sushi is always fresh and the portions are great. Someone else mentioned the rolls come in 8 pieces, which makes eating the pieces easier. Although they have the normal rolls, they offer a variety of rolls that I don't think a lot of places offer.  Very uncommon, but extremely good without it being too intimidating.  Love the decor and the vibe of this place. Very cool without trying so hard to be cool. Its more low key then the other sushi places, relying more on the quality of the food than the party atmosphere. The staff is attentive and always reviews the order with you before they send it in. This is a nice touch to ensure you get the right items.  I would fully recommend Room 112 to anyone looking for a quality meal and at affordable (for sushi) prices."}
{"text":"Sushi was good, but the service was terrible.  The server forgot 2 of the orders, and also got one of the orders wrong and argued with us that we didn't say to hold the sauce.  Also argued with me that I ordered an item I did not order.   No apologies made for the mistakes.   The service needs to be at least on par with the food and price.  Not the case at this restaurant.  Too many other options in uptown Charlotte to have poor service and survive."}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi in uptown Charlotte.  Food is consitently fresh and tasty and always served quickly.  I am a huge fan of their sashimi!  The restaurant itself is very small and does not have the best ambiance, but the food more than makes up for it.  Now if only they had beer on tap...."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here Saturday evening to celebrate our birthdays. Yes we all are virgo's.   Our waiter was pleasant, the food was delicious and it came out in a timely manner. I tried something new to me and liked it. I can't remember what it is call but it had steak on top. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi. It's in the hotel secluded from passerby."}
{"text":"Sushi is okay, decently price, good service and nicely decorated. Good for a birthday outing.  Only downfall is parking since it is in uptown you will have to park in the ramps and walk."}
{"text":"Room 112 is small and pretty hard to find, but the food is crazy delicious.  My significant other and I started out with the gyoza (6 dumplings) and spring roll.  The gyoza plus the dipping sauce was awesome and the spring roll was tasty as well.  For dinner we had the sesame chicken and tuna and salmon maki rolls.  The rolls are kind of small, so make sure you order enough to fill you up!  The portion size for the sesame chicken was just right for a satisfying dinner.  For all that food, plus beer, our check came to about $45, not including tip.  Check out their webpage for pricing and menus!  Our server was very polite and patient as we tried to figure out what to order.  And to top it off, they have a complimentary valet which relieves you of fighting uptown traffic.  The only negative - no dessert!"}
{"text":"The family and I stopped in Charlotte for a stroll downtown (or uptown as they call it here) and ran into this attractive little restaurant. I checked online to see the reviews and it looked like a great find. I ordered the Pad Thai, my daughter ordered the Singapore Noodles, my son, the fried rice and my lovely wife ordered Sushi. The sushi was ok. Not the best but for the price it was fine. The fried rice was average. But I don't think I've ever had fried rice that made me say \"WOW, that was great\" The Singapore Noodle dish was not good. I've had really good Singapore Noodles and in my opinion,  they shouldn't be chewy. Not a good dish. I asked the server if she recommended the Pad Thai. Her response was an enthusiastic \"yes\". It was a disappointment. Honestly, it was not that my expectations were high, it was simply Bad Thai."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Waited to order food for about 10 mins. Asked the hostess to send somebody then waited another 5-6 mins. Ordered food. 30 mins later after placed order inquired where is the food, waiter checked with the kitchen and informed that they did not even started preparing it. Apparently their explanation was that they are very busy. We had to leave and go to the pizza and pasta place across the street which was really great.  This restaurant should have put a sign in front of their entrance that they are not capable of managing multiple clients."}
{"text":"I went to this place after work for a drink.  I don't have a review of the food, since I only got a few drinks, but the service was great.  There was a really cute server working.  I think her name was Menudo or something.  Definitely worth your time just to chat with her for a bit.  But I had to take off a star because there is a really small Asian boy working there that seems kind of rude.  That can be overlooked though because of Menudo."}
{"text":"My husband and I just went to Room 112 this past weekend and we loved it. We made a reservation but we were one of two tables when we got there which was nice. The place was busier when we left but for a Saturday it was quiet. Maybe because there were all kinds of things going on at the Stadiums that day and it was early. The food was really really good.... We got several rolls but our favorites were the Pink Floyd and the 112.... We each had a glass of wine too. The servers were very nice and our food was well presented.  I'm not sure how long this place has been in Charlotte but I will be there again. It is a little hidden so if you're just driving by Tryon you won't see it."}
{"text":"We were thrilled to find this gem on a recent trip to Charlotte.  As west coasters, we're picky about sushi, but this place was perfect. We were the only ones at the bar (I've never understood when people go to a sushi bar and sit at a table, but maybe it was the odd bar stools?!), ordered a combo of what looked great on the menu, our own special orders, and the chef's recommendations. Everything was fabulous - including the presentation. Service was top notch too. If I return to Charlotte, Room 112 will be at the top of my list of places to revisit."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and have enjoyed every meal!  I had never tried scallops before and they were delicious!  We've ordered several different types of rolls and have enjoyed all of it. The service was good and the staff was knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Overall very good, clean and busy. They had a lot of maki roll options but they are mostly tempura based fried in some way. But I did have the grasshopper roll and the seaweed salad on top was a good flavor addition"}
{"text":"Great sushi, some of the best in town. The Pink Floyd roll and the Room 112 are the jam. Good atmosphere, good drinks good sushi."}
{"text":"Caught one of the sushi chefs assemble rolls with the same gloves he touched his phone with and proceeded to make rolls as if it's sanitary. Informed the manager on shift, she didn't seem to care much. Haven't been ever since and wouldn't recommend to any one."}
{"text":"The food here is great. I got the sexy salmon and spicy salmon but the group I was w got a variety of food that they all loved. The sushi took over an hour though which was frustrating since the cooked portions came out after about 30 minutes which is still pretty long. The service was pretty bad, when the sexy salmon came out the waiter torched it on top without warning me at all and I almost had a heart attack. After half of is waiting over an hour for sushi then the waiter disappeared and we had to wait about 15 minutes more for the check. None of our food was discounted so I paid $25 for a meal I only ate half of because I filled up on rice and miso soup. I would recommend it for taste but be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Get here early for weekday lunch!  We got one of the last tables before standing room only at 11:45am.  This is a small dining area with a great menu so it goes quick! I had the Combo A - two sushi rolls from a short list with a salad; Cali and Philly.  Both were very fresh, but the smoked salmon was perfect!  I also shared fried daumplings and a bite of my friends Singapore Rice Noodles.  The pork in the dumplings was just the right amount of fattiness, hoison sauce not even needed.  The curry on the noodles was also just right with meaty shrimp in a portion I'd be able to enjoy for a dinner meal. Service was very efficient."}
{"text":"awesome sushi. And appitizers. Fast service and friendly. Look, i eat out alot so i know good from bad and in between, this.place is worth your money. And a cool.location if your uptown Charlotte near trade and tryon st."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday. Had been before and had a great experience, this time not so much. Friends who ordered mixed drinks waited 45 mins for drink to arrive. They finally received their drinks after receiving their entrees! Food was okay. Some at our table received cold, well done food. Really disappointed in what's happened to this place."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  Whenever I go to a sushi place, I order the chef's special.  I just want to see what they pick.  The only thing is that the variety is pretty predictable.  So I am always looking for a place to surprise me.  Well, there were no surprises among the selection but they were fresh!  Sashimi melted in my mouth.  Good portions, too!  For me, the freshness made up for the lack of variety."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and it wasn't that busy. The sushi was great, I had the Sapporo and Leap roll. The Sashimi were nice sized pieces . But the Chicken Pad See Ew was disappointing, it was very bland and wasn't made with the right noodles.  The service was alright, Although it took awhile for our waiter to come check on our table."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Great location. Fresh and delicious sushi. Loved the butterfly yellowtail appetizer! Must try!"}
{"text":"If you want to eat here for weekday lunch, get here early. This tiny restaurant fills up quickly, so by 11:45AM there was already a wait list on my last visit.  This restaurant is tucked behind a fountain in a corporate building and I never would have found it if a friend hasn't taken me there on my first visit.  The menu is filled with delicious sushi items and combos. The only problem with that is I don't like sushi. (I've tried, I really have! I've never felt such peer pressure to like a type of food.) Fortunately, they have some non-sushi alternatives on the menu, but not very many.  My usual dish is the Sesame Chicken, and it's good, but not great. The sauce tastes like it's artificially thickened pretty heavily (more than a little cornstarch in it, I think) and it's spooned over the chicken, rather than the chicken being tossed in it. I tried ordering the shrimp version of the dish once, and it was a mess. The coating was falling off the shrimp and it was more trouble to eat than it was worth.  Service is solid, if unremarkable (that's a good thing, in my book) and the price is reasonable. My friends love it so I keep visiting, but I probably wouldn't go if it wasn't someone else's idea."}
{"text":"One of the best Asian spots in town! I've been for dinner several times and have now tried lunch as well! The service is always quick and even when they are busy the wait times are never crazy! The food is superb and the quality remains the same every time that I go here! If you're looking for fast, quality, Asian food in the heart of downtown Charlotte, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Had the Salmon Dream and the Spicy Tuna roll. Service was great and quite friendly. The space may be a little small but the atmosphere is very relaxing. The location was easy to fun with it being just behind the waterfall on the corner of Trade and Tryon"}
{"text":"Best sushi place uptown!!! The room 112 roll and the pink Floyd rolls are our favorites. The waiter knows us and knows our drink order, app order, and sushi order EVERYTIME we come in. And it's not all that often that we do! Very impressed. We order the calamari which is amazing for an app."}
{"text":"Normally I love Room 112 for sushi. This time I decided to be adventurous and got the Sesame Chicken. The chicken was flash fried and THEN cut up into strips.  Most of the Chicken didn't even have sauce on it. The sauce was ok.  I would not recommend."}
{"text":"The dining room may be tiny, but the sushi here is so good! I think it is one of the most reasonably priced Sushi restaurants around also.. The only draw backs are the street parking and every time I've been here the service has been a little slow. I recommend the cherry blossom roll, it comes in the shape of a flower and its wrapped with pink seaweed!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here last weekend while visiting Charlotte. Had a slighly tough time finding it.. found the address with no problem but didn't see the restaurant initially. It's tucked behind the fountain in the corner. Staff were very friendly, decor was nice. On a Friday night around 915 ish the last of the big crowd were finishing up and we were able to get a table with no wait. My friend and I split 3 rolls (sexy salmon, catepillar, and another that I already forgot). They were all excellent!  Location was convenient because from where we parked we were able to walk to the Uptown bars. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I had been to Room 112 several years ago and remember having a good experience. I came back this week on a business trip and overall enjoyed my experience. I did not have a wait and the waitress was attentive. The prices (especially coming from NY/SF) are great. My only complaint was that the quality of the sushi was not amazing. Obviously I still enjoyed myself and think the value and overall flavor combination was enough to warrant 4 stars, but the sushi and sashimi texture was a little soft and not quite what I would normally hope for.   I also got the Miso soup and steamed Gyoza, which were excellent. I would definitely come back and hope that maybe I catch them after a new shipment."}
{"text":"I got terribly lost trying to visit the first time... 20+ crave-induced trips later-i've got it down pat!  This is my \"go-to\" sushi-spot if I'm showing someone Charlotte or just want a precious quaint atmosphere with super fresh, creative rolls!  Dont like sushi? Their sesame chicken is uniquely delicious!"}
{"text":"Room 112 is one of very, very few places that serve sushi in the Uptown area (other than Fujo and KO Sushi).  During lunch, it can get super crowded and even if you're taking your food out, you will likely still have to wait a good 10-20 minutes to get your order.  I would recommend calling ahead during lunch.  I've been here for both lunch and dinner and prefer this place to be a quick lunch pick up spot.  They have lunch specials which consist of 2 rolls and a salad for around $9.  The rolls are consistently decent and I always order the spicy rolls which unfortunately come with that \"crunch\", which is more like fried tempura (and extra fatness), acting as a filler for more fish.  I'm really not a fan of the crunch rolls at all, but it's decent.  The salad here is very mediocre at best - a bunch of iceberg lettuce (which has like zero nutritional value) and what tastes like thousand island dressing - yikes.  I normally skip the salad part and head straight for the goods.  For dinner, I'd rather go to O-Ku.  In all fairness, Room 112 isn't a bad spot for a quick bite and definitely a decent option lunch, but given the wait, quality, and value, I prefer KO sushi a little more for lunch - that's if we're doing a comparison of all the sushi places in Uptown.  Rolls are decent, but nothing to call home about."}
{"text":"cool, nothing amazing.  intimate spot.   Hungry, go eat.  Shit, thats it folks."}
{"text":"Good sushi, just not enough to get full. You have to order two rolls for a decent size meal. I had the Blue Buddha cocktail and it wasn't tasty at all - wouldn't recommend that. My friend had the Korean BBQ dish and there was so little meat and mostly broccoli and other veggies (3/4 of the entire dish were veggies). Veggies were however tasty and fresh. It took long to get our food and the service wasn't really all that because they were busy when I was there (no water refills, asked for spicy mayo and never got it, got my miso soup together with the main dish, not before, etc)."}
{"text":"I went tonight with a friend. I was unsure if to get chicken pad thai or chicken Kung pao. I decided for the second one. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Small and intimate, I love the location behind the Tryon st. fountain. The sushi was great! The service not so great. I would give only one star but the sushi was really good. BUT DO NOT ORDER DRINKS!!! They brought us a Crown and Coke that was CLEARLY Canadian Mist and coke, and still charged premium liquor price. I know the taste difference between the two and it is VERY distinct. My LIT was almot nonexistant, with mostly sour mix. Sushi alone, five stars. Combined experience, the sushi is what gave it two stars instead of one."}
{"text":"So I get there and I immediately order a lychee martini, sweet! Then I get the salt-and-pepper calamari, really good but be careful because it comes out super hot and you bite into it and you burn your mouth off  I am a fan of leap, pink Floyd and cherry blossom. I've never had a problem with service or with their food."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken teriyaki and it was really good. Plus they gave me way more chicken than I would have ever expected. Great little location and cool layout."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places I've ever tried! Lunch was absolutely phenomenal! The calamari is delicious! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I conquered the sushi at Room 112 today. I got the Caterpillar roll and spicy tuna hand roll and both were fresh and tasty. The have an awesome selection of rolls as was surprised to see more than just one vegetarian item. They have sushi lunch combo's along with cheap rolls-most were in the $6-$10 range, I dig that.    Service was pretty beat this time around-it could be because of the influx of people out for lunch or NCAA crowd but it was pretty bad. Them dropping off an Andes mint with my check scored them brownie points though."}
{"text":"Sad day when you try to call in a order, you get placed on hold.  I finally get in the restaurant the lady at the register says \"oh, our kitchen is closed!\" It's 30 mins before closing and I just wanted a take out...  Great food but wow 30 mins before closing... Kitchen is closed.  I guess come before 9:30..."}
{"text":"Best Asian Food in downtown Charlotte. If you work here, this is probably your best lunch option. The sushi and rice bowls are very good, especially for Charlotte. They get busy during lunchtime."}
{"text":"Would like to say I could rate the food but my wife and I just sat down and waited for 10 solid minutes with multiple attempts to make eye contact with servers and hostess' standing around just talking amongst themselves with nobody even saying hello or asking if we wanted drinks.  Saw several other folks sitting around hoping to get service or refills and looking frustrated.  One server talked to a couple next to us the entire 10 mins never acknowledging us.  She walked by 5 times (yes I counted).  On the 5th time she SAT DOWN with the couple and continued to carry on conversation.  Thanks but no thanks.  Had to leave bc could not wait any longer to even be acknowledged."}
{"text":"I've been all around the Uptown sushi bars during lunch when I'm at the office, but after spending my days there, I rarely venture there at night.  For lunch sushi, Room 112 is my favorite, but I thought to give it a fair review, I needed to go for dinner.    One night I walked over after work to do just that.    Rather than getting the lunch combo, like I ordinarily do, I was able to sample 2 special rolls off the dinner menu.  As usual, Room 112 sent out some good sushi in a small, intimate space.  I was happy to find out that they don't cut back on quality on lunch as the dinner sushi was just as good as what I get during the day.    Room 112 will remain my favorite Uptown sushi spot until something comes along that really blows my socks off.  That has not yet occurred."}
{"text":"Tucked away on the corner of Trade and Tryon, this is a good stop. The variety wasn't as vast as I typically like with touches of mango, special sweet sauces, and less fried things, but I'm also in the South what should I expect. The fish was fresh, the wait staff was attentive, and the prices were comparable. Overall it was a good choice for dinner to satisfy or at least dull my sushi craving....for now. :)"}
{"text":"Really amazing food!!!  ·Spring Rolls- omg great!! ·Edamame- terrible, hated it!   ·salad with ginger dressing- loved it!!   MY ENTREES.. ·Wok broccoli and zucchini - yummy  ·Wok - rainbow - Broccoli, zucchini, onion, & asparagus.- Ok, lunch special wasn't as good as dinner.  MY FRIENDS ENTREES.. ·Spicy Tuna, yellow tail, tuna nigiri- yummy  ·Spicy Tuna, yellow tail, scallop- liked it but not as much as the dinner entree"}
{"text":"This is a great little \"hole in the wall\" treasure!  Wonderful selection of sushi rolls with both standard and unique choices.  To find it, just k ow it's one the corner of the Trade & Tryon intersection and look for the sign.   I always enjoy their cherry Blossom roll and their spicy tuna is also a win!  Because I tend to stick with things I really like, I have to be honest and say I haven't had much else, since these rolls with some miso soup are what I go there for!  If you like good sushi, you won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi at a reasonable price.  Ive paid more and gotten less quality at other places, but this is not one of them.  Its located close to epicenter in the heart of downtown.  Its a cozy spot with a sitdown bar.  Service was A+ and food was delicious. I recommend the sushi sampler."}
{"text":"4 stars for this small little sushi hot spot!  We had several rolls and every one was fresh, delicious and well-made.  Everything was tasty and the service was attentive and friendly!  I would definitely recommend giving it a try but have a second option in mind if you don't get there early; it's tight in there!  Great ambiance!"}
{"text":"Gem of a restaurant tucked in bottom floor and a corner of a high rise building.   Sashimi was fresh and beautifully presented. Mediterranean roll was tasty. Seafood hot and sour soup will knock your socks off!    Service by our waitress Ava couldn't have been better.  Very accommodating and friendly.   Atmosphere subdued with lots of colorful walls. Casual dress is just fine."}
{"text":"I order takeout for lunch and it's always ready when I get there.  They also make the drink when you get there so the ice doesn't melt.  I have liked everything that I've tried so far.  It is smaller, so if you want to sit get there early."}
{"text":"Very good place to visit. Loved their Singapore noodles and king pao chicken. Their fried rice was good too. Definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Typically order the lunch special, but felt like trying a new roll.  The Upper Manhattan roll was great!  ($11.95)  Service was pretty fast and the waitress was nice, in and out in less than 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Very good sushi. The presentation was amazing. The appetizer of Calamari we ordered was so pretty I almost didn't want to mess it up. Service was fast and friendly. They were even okay with my picky eaters strange requests."}
{"text":"Went for lunch - overall experience was great. Reasonable prices, fast staff, great flavor and freshness to the fish. We had the nigiri and maki combo as well as gyoza as an appetizer. The only negative is that to a bit of a cramped space to dine in. If you don't mind being close to other tables this is a perfect, inexpensive lunch option."}
{"text":"Cool little place. The food is really good but the layout of this restaurant is super awkward and small. Tables really close together. The presentation and taste of the sushi was beautiful. Chicken salad on point. Shrimp teriyaki was delicious. But the staff could use a little more enthusiasm and as well as decor. Overall location is great and sushi is as well."}
{"text":"Fish isn't as fresh as the high rating would suggest. Uni looks like it was the last scrapes. I think people drink more than eat here. Sat at the bar to watch the sushi be made. Not as open as most sushi bars. Couldn't really see much. Like they're hiding something. Came over because it was in walking distance to my hotel and open late. Two entrances/exits.  To be honest, I had to go to another sushi spot the following day to make up for what was lacking at this place. Maybe it's average for Charlotte. But subpar from Cali. #truth  Remember: food adventures are out there. If at first you don't succeed, then try another place. Ha!"}
{"text":"Small, nice restaurant. Good vibe in there and low lighting. Both times I've been there I've had great service and the food is amazing! My new \"usual\" is going to be the Philadelphia roll and the Kalbi. I definitely recommend this place. It's a little hidden though inside a hotel I believe but there are signs outside :)"}
{"text":"Sushi is not as fresh as the other places - service is horrible. The place itself, a good attempt, but feels like it's in the basement of an old bank building. Too many other options to choose from make it tough to give this more than 1-2 stars."}
{"text":"Good, good sushi here.  Some of the best I have ever had.  But you will pay for it.  Staff are very good.  Friendly, attentive and also good at anticipating what you need.  I like that because you're not interrupted, yet you are not neglected.  That is classy.  We ate at the sushi bar, and I think at the end of the night, the bill for each of us was just under $100, but we were definitely splurging.  A good reminder that you are in the center of the 2nd largest banking center in the States.  The decor is suitable for high end sushi bar.  Expectations were nicely met."}
{"text":"Room 112 is my go-to spot in Uptown for sushi - I prefer it over Enso, Fujo, and other sushi restaurants in the city. Their ingredients are fresh and the menu is well-priced. I've dined in and ordered take out and the quality of food remains the same. They have a great lunch menu as well, including sushi combos.   I typically get sashimi, a roll or two, and miso soup. While it's a simple order, they get it just right and it always tastes fresh and delicious. However, they also have other stir-fry, noodles, and rice based dishes on the menu - there's something for everyone.   Room 112 is tucked away, but that doesn't mean it's a secret. While it's a small restaurant, it can fill up quickly, especially during lunch! They're also open late, which is convenient when I've been delayed and get in late or am looking for a late night snack."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 5 other ladies for a birthday party. It's a little difficult to find, but to the person who said it was behind the waterfall, great job because that is about how you would describe it.   I made reservations because they request that you do for a party of 5 or more. They were very accommodating even tho I had to push back the reservations about an hour before our scheduled time.   When we got there I ordered a vodka, Sprite with house vodka (later on found out that is Aristocrat :P), it was ok. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, because at Viet Thai Noodle House this dish is amazing, but I had never had it elsewhere. Other people at the table ordered wine, and sushi rolls.   When the Pad Thai came out I just did not like it at all. It tasted like the sauce was sweet and sour sauce, which was confusing.   Everyone seemed to enjoy their sushi rolls, but when you're ordering just watch what it's rolled in because someone that was expecting the standard rice and seaweed, got cucumber.   Overall, I thought the service was pretty good, the prices were good for uptown, but the food was just not there."}
{"text":"Good location for people working in uptown Charlotte to dine at. I've been here about 5-6 times, but have only tried their sushi. Sushi was always fresh and service was quick.   Tip - if you sit at the bar and order sushi, you can ask the head chef what he recommends (aka, whats \"most\" fresh).  Overall - above average experience."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Room 112 for lunch, but every time I went on my break there  was a wait. I ventured there today with coworkers and made sure to arrive at 11:45 to avoid the rush and a wait. We started out with steamed Gyoza, which was so good! Following, we ate 12 (yes 12) rolls because there were so many choices! We got two of each of the staples...Cali roll and Spicy tuna roll. The California roll was good and the spicy tuna roll was okay. Following 8: (2) Cherry Blossoms...AMAZING so good. The Spider Roll is typically my fave and it was soooo good. The Pink Floyd and Salmon Dream were also really great and total hits. I can't remember which other three rolls we got (sorry) but those were also great. One of us got a ginger salad and a couple of cokes brought us in at $140 plus tip... not bad. Its worth the price because the cheaper stuff at KO down the road is terrible. I will be back! (Doesn't beat New Zealand Cafe but comes darn close!)"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden little gem. The Sushi was fantastic and the same price we would pay anywhere else. I loved the modern feel of the Resturant and the service was very attentive. Overall, we were very satisfied and will be coming back several times to enjoy another wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Like Star Search, 2.25...lol. After reading about the lack of value, we considered letting our $25 paid Groupon go to waste. We figured some value is better than none? I did let Groupon know of this issue and they could not do anything about it. All they can do is issue a refund if a business treated you poorly/ closed. Go figure...  Reviews were not kidding, this place is SMALL. Started with the tempura and it was tasty.There were a mix  of carrots, mushrooms, shrimp, broccoli and onions.We also tried  3 rolls: Just Pete ( flash fried smoked salmon, crab, avocado, cream cheese + combination sauce), Lox (Flash fried with salmon, crab meat, cream cheese + masago, spicy aioli) & Upper Manhattan (Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, masago + avocado, wrapped in thinly sliced cucumber, ponzu sauce) They were not made tightly -the fillings were falling apart and a tad lukewarm. Glad we did not get sick. Oh well, they get an A for effort. The rice entrees looked good on another's plate. Maybe we will venture back here."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a few friends Friday night. The service was friendly and accommodating. Unfortunately my friends were stuck in traffic so there were only two of us who made it in time for our seven o'clock reservation while everyone else arrived at 730. No dirty looks, no impatient badgering. Although maybe Charlotte people are just much kinder than the LA food scene that I'm used to.   The food was great. I wish I could remember the assortment of sushi we got but unfortunately all I remember was that everything was good. The only thing that is keeping this place from getting a five is the quality of the spicy tuna in one of the rolls was not great. Kind of chewy and stringy in parts. Definitely not the melt in your mouth tuna that can make sushi exceptional.   The place is small so wouldn't be surprised if you have to wait. The location is a little weird, inside what looks like an office building so the entrance doesn't face the street and there's no parking associated but that's uptown for you."}
{"text":"one of the best asian fusion restaurants in charlotte. i prefer their asian entrees like the beef shortribs over their sushi selection. decent selection of cocktails and sakes. service and ambiance are good as well."}
{"text":"Simple sushi joint with nice ambiance. Service a bit slow and the menu choices is subpar. They do have some Japanese sake and beer for tasting."}
{"text":"I love Room 112. Everything on the menu has been spectacular. Some of my favorites include the sexy salmon, cherry blossom as well as the dragon roll. Wonderful wine selection and good service. One of my favorite places for sushi in the city.   Lovely intimate atmoshphere. Great date spot."}
{"text":"I have been craving sushi lately, and as I wondered upon Room 112, I decided to give it a shot.  It can be a little hard to find, hidden behind on the fountain on E.Trade and Tryon. The restaurant is relatively small but I love the modern Asian chic bar/club feel and decor.   The first item I had was a \"Cherry Blossom\" roll as recommended by the waiters. The rice and ingredients were wrapped in a thin pink layer (could be seaweed but I am not sure). It has tempura shrimp, tuna, and cucumber. Everything combined well in the mouth. The rolls were in the shape of a flower too!   The second time I had a tuna roll. It's got white tuna on the outside and red tuna and other veggies in the inside and a hint of semi-spicy sauce on top. I loved it. My girlfriend ordered a veggie stir-fry, and it was actually pretty good too!   In the end, I still was not satisfied with my sushi crave so I ordered a tuna nigiri , which comes on rice, except that I said tuna sashimi (no rice)...guess I have been out of Japan for too long...however, it was actually a blessing in disguise!! The tuna was very  fresh, and the display looked as if I was in Japan! Good job Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I have had sushi all over the world and this place is still my favorite. Yes, I have lived in SF and LA. The Pink Floyd and Cherry Blossom rolls are absolutely out of this world great!"}
{"text":"The upper Manhattan role was probably my favorite sushi roll that I've ever had! I came in from out of town, but every single time I come back I will definitely be heading up to room 112"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had. Their regular food is mediocre, but the sushi is sublime. Oh, and parking is the worst, but its worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. That spot was a little hard to find at first but once we did we were so happy to be there.   My boyfriend and I went for date night here and the service was amazing, along with the sushi and drink specials. Highly recommend and definitely listen to your servers suggestions ours did not steer us wrong! Love this place"}
{"text":"I learned that while on jury duty in Mecklenburg County, they give you a long lunch. Which is a nice thing since you can't leave the room otherwise. It's also a real nice thing if you have decent weather and can meet your wife for lunch in uptown. By the time I took the trek, we ended up settling on Room 112 as they have a decent sushi lunch special that we figured wouldn't take too long. After a long morning of waiting, I wanted something to snack on quickly so I ended up ordering some edamame in addition to my sushi lunch combo. Both the spicy tuna and crunchy rolls I ordered were good.   If you stop in for lunch like I did, be prepared for a crowd. The place isn't large and they get pretty busy. We ended up sitting at the bar which was a blessing in disguise. The wait staff behind the bar were super attentive and I feel like we got our rolls faster than we would have at a table. Also if you are in a rush, order ahead. There must have been at least 10 to-go bags on the counter so they can turn those orders quickly.   All in all, it was one of the better lunch sushi experiences I have had and would consider it again!"}
{"text":"Hidden in a downtown bank building, Room 112 is easy to miss. But once you take the time to find it, you will be glad that you did. The environs are dark, modern, and comfortable, the staff friendly, and the menu tantalizing with enough variety to suit many palates. My companion and I opted for gyoza, a Just Pete sushi roll (fried smoked salmon, crab, avocado, and cream cheese), a beef and vegetable stir fry, and Singapore rice noodles with chicken and shrimp. The flavors were well-balanced, the meat was tender, and everything was fresh and fragrant. This might be the best-smelling restaurant I've ever had occasion to frequent. Prices were moderate, with good-sized portions for the money: We paid $6 for the app, $10 for the sushi, and $11-$12 each for the entrees. Ultimately, one who has enjoyed a lot of Asian cuisine won't be breaking any new ground here, but what familiar favorites Room 112 offers, it does damn well."}
{"text":"The food made me sick. The portions are tiny. I do better with publix sushi. The fish was not fresh. I had to throw half away.  I'm still sick."}
{"text":"I had lunch here this week after hearing pretty good reviews.  They offer a small lunch menu with typical Chinese entrees with rice and a spring roll and sushi.  The dinner menu is pretty extensive.  I like the vibe of 112, very laid back.  I tried the mixed veggies with chicken($6.95) and it was ok, nothing special.....the veggies were nice and crisp and covered in a brown sauce with rice and spring roll....again very average.  On my next trip I tried the sushi combo(2 rolls and a salad $8.95).  I had the crunchy and spicy crab roll which were both very good including the salad with ginger dressing.  I'll definitely return for the sushi only."}
{"text":"Beyond disappointed...... Just went to room 112 for dinner. There were only 5 other tables with patrons dinning so i would except somewhat speedy service. Sat down and the waitress provided us with menus and we requested 2 waters at that time. We then sat for 15 mins and didnt see a server again. I watched 2 girls behind the counter on thier phone, one girl waiting on tables and one girl clearing tables in between being going over to a customer standing at the counter area and rubbing his head. After 15 mins i called over someone who looked like the manger and asked why we still had not even recieved our water. Instead of saying let me get you that, he said let me see who your server is. I was with an officer in uniform so I'm now wondering if this is why everyone else got served but not us?We got up and left and will not be dining there again."}
{"text":"Stayed across the street and found this place by accident.  What a great find.  Great location, right downtown.  I found the service to be quite attentive, and the menu selection excellent.  I keep it simple with sushi, and sometimes gauge how much I like it by the wasabi, which in this case was fresh and spicy, how I like it!  My only negative was that it was a little loud, so I wouldn't necessarily expect to have an intimate conversation when they are busy.  Good selection of cocktails, but I just had a beer (I can't remember if it was Sapporo or Ki-Rin).  My wife had plum wine.  Food presentation was gorgeous, too.  Will definitely hit this place again on our next trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I ate a late lunch here last week while on a business trip. We entered at around 4 PM and the servers were confused by our presence. After an awkward moment, the staff realized we were customers and the hostess got up from her perch to sit us at the bar.   Upon glancing the menu I understood the restaurant was a Pan Asian Fusion/Sushi bar. I ordered the Pad Thai and the waiter asked me, \"have you had Pad Thai before?\" I said, \"yes.\" He replied, \"then you don't want to have ours, you won't like it.\"   Befuddled, I ordered the same dish as my colleague, the teriyaki chicken. I ate the entire thing only because I was very hungry, having skipped breakfast and lunch that day. Despite this, I didn't particularly enjoy it. The flavor was bland. If I had to do it all over again, I would've ordered sushi as it seems to be their specialty."}
{"text":"Really good. My husband and I went on a Saturday night and it wasn't so full around the time we went in. So it was pretty nice. We ordered the California roll, the super crunchy, the Philadelphia, the other California roll,two spring rolls, and a sex on the beach. We had a total of 8 orders of sushi and our total was about $60  We like this place and the atmosphere. Definitely going there again. It's a must try."}
{"text":"Wow this was awesome sushi! The Pink Floyd roll is probably the best I've had. Friendly, fast, service. A gem worth finding uptown."}
{"text":"Room 112 serves up a sweet Pad Thai and some pretty tasty sushi rolls. Typically I can eat my weight in sushi, but I found myself eating off my husband's plate for the noodles. Each Pad Thai has its own flavor; if you're in the mood for sweet and a little tangy, you'll find it here. I got the Grasshopper and California rolls. They were of good size and very satisfying. Yummy.  It's a small to medium sized space, interior is all red, and a sushi bar that seats about 6 or 8. The noise level is a bit rowdy due to the tight quarters, background music, and talkative patrons...but not enough to deter you.  Service is friendly and they do multi-tasking well.   I'll be back the next time I'm Uptown and in the mood for noodles and rice!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi. Come here often for lunch with my Manager. If you get there anytime after 12-noon, plan on waiting for a table, sitting at the bar, or sitting outside. Lunch time this place is CROWDED. Good food every time we've gone, but at times (during lunch) service can be slow. I'll chalk that up to the busy lunch time period.   Overall, great place, could be a 5-star rating for me if they upped the service a bit."}
{"text":"Over-priced and do not get much bang for your buck when it comes to the sushi. Noodle dishes are good but sushi is not worth it at all"}
{"text":"Sushi is amazing! Great service ambiance is cool all around great place. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our experience here. Nice, classy little place. Our server took good care of us and her suggestions were spot on. We had the calamari (wow) and 3 rolls. The Pink Floyd and the Super Crunchy were super good, the other which I can't recall now, was just very good. All in all,  the location,  the ambiance, and the quality make this a definite return spot and a top recommend eatery for sushi and Japanese fare."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere hidden in a classic style building.  Great service at lunch.  Seafood Hot and Sour soup was a nice twist.  Rainbow and King Kong rolls were delicious. Pink Floyd was the bomb.  Rolls are actually a bit small in diameter but good quality.  Definitely a solid sushi spot downtown."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Pink Floyd roll is a definitely a must try. Service was great, nice little modern spot."}
{"text":"Always a good meal no matter what you get! This time I got the Pad Thai, even though Sushi was calling my name! Just had to try it. And it didn't disappoint, though it's not the best in town by a longshot. Still a decent dish with plenty of chicken and the sweet/heat noodles known as Pad Thai. Note: This dish could have used more heat.....just saying.  Overall a good meal for a really good price!"}
{"text":"We need more places where you can get sushi in uptown like we need more condo projects.  Within the actual uptown area (walking distance from trade & tryon) you can get sushi at almost 10 places.  You can't find a pancake or actual breakfast place in uptown (pancake house isn't walking distance so drop that thought) but any instant craving for a spicy tuna roll can be pacified in mere steps.  As you can gather, I was a little bias when I walked into Room 112.    The inside was smaller with a light fusion feel accompanied by some traditional Asian atmosphere.  We were seated promptly and provided waters (a hydrated table is a happy table).  The server questioned if we had dined there before and overall she was quite pleasant.  We ordered about 10 rolls and the fourth person got an entree.  The sushi was delicious.  The rolls were smaller but came in 8 pieces (most of the rolls) so there were more pieces just of smaller size.  It's nice this way because it limits situations where you have to \"mouth\" a huge piece and have to chew for an hour like it's your job.  The entree (I did not taste) was so so.  I don't think it was as much from a flavor aspect but moreover from a presentation perspective.  Sesame chicken is usually made by cooking the chicken with the sauce (or just combining the two) as opposed to cooking chicken tenders, slicing them- and putting the sauce on the side to dip in.  But hey, I was there for sushi and it was great.    I would go back to Room 112 again for a roll and a Sapporo anytime.  I'm weary of sushi places that force loud music on a busy night to compensate for sloppy bland rolls or sushi places that offer huge all you can eat specials screaming \"we don't move much fish so the freshness should come into question\".  Room 112 is the perfect size to ensure your quality doesn't get negotiated for capacity.  I'm giving Room 112 three stars for now because of the entrée and in the end, any team can win on any night; show me consistency and I'll show you four or five stars and my new sushi spot."}
{"text":"We were only in Charlotte for 2 days but this place was by far the best out of all the places we tried. It's like a hidden gem because it's in an odd corner of a building. But don't give up looking for this place if you are looking because it's worth the stop.   We ordered the Philadelphia roll, which comes with smoked salmon. We don't really care for smoked salmon so we asked if they can make it with fresh salmon and they did. It was very fresh and great portion. I only wish I could have ordered more. We also ordered the spicy tuna, it had just the right hint of spice and the tuna was very fresh.   We also ordered the chicken pad thai - this dish was good but it had a bit too much sauce. I would have preferred it to be less soupy and a little more thick on the sauce side. The house fried rice was absolutely delicious. My mouth watered with every single bite, it was fresh and it wasn't overly greasy like in other places. This place is a must try. If I ever go back to Charlotte, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat Asian cuisine and is very reasonably priced. This is my go-to place for sushi, as well as Chinese style food since I live in uptown. The quality of food from their \"From the Wok\" menu completely blows away any Chinese takeout you'll find around here for roughly the same amount of money. I'd recommend this establishment to anyone looking for great experience in both quality and service."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte and checked out this place twice for dinner.  This place is one of the few Asian options near the Convention Center without having to drive somewhere.    Ordered the sesame soy tuna tartare and Upper Manhattan roll.  Enjoyed the tartare, but didn't enjoy the cucumber wrap on the Manhattan roll.  That's just a personal preference and probably should have just had sashimi.  The 2nd time I got the chirashi and appreciated the sushi chef putting in decent size fish versus chopping up pieces like some restaurants do."}
{"text":"I love love love the food. Always yummy and I always get the Singapore Rice Noodles. Brandon is alsuoer awesome as a manager. However, there are times when I experience a lack of customer service. We had to address tonight. #FoodieCall #CustomerService ask about IT! FF"}
{"text":"I love sushi... This is my first attempt at finding good sushi in Charlotte after recently moving here.   This place was pretty good! Good choice of appetizers, drinks, and sushi. The sushi was good... Not the best I've had but definitely not the worst. The restaurant was quaint, service was great... I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch!! Pink Floyd, cherry blossom and steak sushi roll are so spot on. Thanks for the other reviews - I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is good there.  Have been going for lunch for the past few years and have not had a bad meal there.  Tasty, veggies are fresh and good flavors."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night dinner, meaning close to closing, and they were happy to sit my colleague and I. We both like sashimi and nigiri, so we got the sampler platter. The fish was very fresh and was presented in decent sized pieces for sashimi. They had a few good options of sake and were able to provide a recommendation.  This place is designed to be small and casual. I liked that it was smaller and the decor is trendy. I'm not going to say this is the best sushi I have every had, but for the price and atmosphere it definitely gets put in the list of places I'll come back to."}
{"text":"Great little spot tucked into downtown - not too loud and with comfortable decor.  We ordered one of the sampler platters and were very happy with the contents.  The sushi was fresh, presented nicely and tasty.  There was a large selection of items on the menu, so non-sushi eaters also had plenty to choose from."}
{"text":"Cherry Blossom was great. The food was fresh.   The restaurant is really small and not good for small children."}
{"text":"I don't have a bad thing to say about this restaurant. We are from Athens GA and were in town for a concert. I found Room 112 on yelp, of course. Reviews were good so we gave it a shot. We're glad we did! Extremely fast, friendly, and efficient service. Along with great sushi. We got the Philadelphia and the Lox. We would def go back and would recommend friends go as well."}
{"text":"Fellow yelpers, hubs and I went here for dinner before Fourth of July fireworks and I'm really happy we did! I'm always hesitant to try new sushi places because you just never know, but Room 112 was delicious!   It's a smaller venue, but there was no wait and plenty of seating when we arrived. Service was a little slow, but they had one waitress for the whole restaurant. There are delicious combinations for rolls and they had a nice cocktail and drink menu. We got 7 rolls between the 4 of us and we loved every single one. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"As much as I hate to say it I experienced my first incidence of truly terrible service at Room 112 today at lunch. (3/7/13)  I went at noon. It was packed with diners. I again sat at the sushi bar. I was given a menu & a ginger ale. I had to ask for the ginger ale as my waitress wasn't there. The waitress I did get was terrible. It took her 10 minutes to take my order & I had to get her attention by getting another server involved.   The sushi itself was delicious. I ordered salmon, yellowtail, white tuna & scallop. I also ordered a passion roll. The passion roll had an interesting texture due to being wrapped in soy paper versus rice. Unfortunately it had no flavor whatsoever. I was looking forward to the roll based on the comments of other Yelpers. What a shame. The waitress asked if I wanted a refill on my drink when I had two pieces of sushi left on my plate. Instead I asked her for the check. Lunch was filling but it wasn't as good a time as the previous couple of days were. The three stars are for the sushi only."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat while I'm visiting downtown Charlotte. Love to sit at the sushi bar. Delicious, creative sushi. Small, intimate restaurant so you may want to try to get reservations to grab a spot (as it gets full quickly)."}
{"text":"We went to Room 112 twice. The food is ok. I would any day prefer Basil over this place.  The biggest issue we had was with the service. The waiter was almost throwing the dishes at the table, no napkins, no cutlery was given. When we asked for it they said its over and they gave us disposable plastic spoons.  No one was taking care to re fill the glasses or soft drinks. I didn't want to give a single penny for tip but they added gratuity from their side.  Very Very poor service. The most disappointing experience in Charlotte downtown. Would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great sushi and Asian fare! Service is always quick and the food is always amazing. This has become a staple in my boyfriend and I's \"go to\" restaurants. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The Lower Manhattan is by far my favorite roll. I went three times in one week to order their Lower Manhattan with a side of Wonton soup. Although the food is wonderful, the service is largely inconsistent. I ordered two sushi rolls (same kind) and they were stuffed into one tray when I made my order to go. The presentation was terrible and it lacked wasabi and ginger, I assume because the to go order was so tightly packed. It may very well be that they just forgot to include it. If ordering to go, perhaps ask if they could pack all rolls separately. I give four stars for the great food, with the missing star being attributed to my to go order being disappointing. I would completely recommend this restaurant 100% dine in."}
{"text":"Just ordered the Singapore noodles and I am very disappointed. Not much meat at all.  It's like 80% noodles.  Terrible"}
{"text":"Room 112 is the trendy sushi bar you thought only existed in Manhattan.   I had dinner here with friends last Saturday and was nothing short of impressed. The restaurant is tucked in a little corner on the side of a large corporate building, making it secluded and secretive-- who doesn't want to eat in a secret sushi bar?   All four of us comfortably sat in the middle of the restaurant, with a perfect view of the bar where our sushi was created. I ordered the ninja turtle cocktail to start, which was a tropical adventure, a true pre-dinner treat. As an appetizer I had the seaweed salad coupled with clam sushi. The seaweed salad was served in a petit glass bowl (posted pictures) and clams on a small sushi try-- both exquisite. Next I had my entree, which was an order of the salmon dream. The roll was moderately sized, but packed a punch. The roll was adorned with lapidary slabs of salmon and spicy mayo (my absolute favorite). This sushi could have quite possibly been the best salmon roll I've ever eaten.   If you're looking for an intimate date-night spot or even a small get together with friends, room 112 is the place to go."}
{"text":"It was better than expected. The Upper and Lower Manhattan rolls were great. Fresh tasty and excellent service too. Glad I found Room 112 on Yelp."}
{"text":"Great food. Good service. Nice ambience. Fresh sushi. Beautiful presentation. I had the 5 course meal during Restaurant Week. I wish I had taken pictures but I didn't want to look like the sometimes semi-immature adult that I can be since I was with strangers who didn't take pics. I will definitely visit again. Website says valet parking but there isn't any."}
{"text":"Every was amazing! Service, sushi and food. Affordable prices compare to Puerto Rico!!!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute sushi place. It was great for date night. The sushi was amazing and they had a large variety of Sake to choose from. It is right in the heart of downtown. Will be back to enjoy the downtown environment and sushi"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is amazing. I specifically enjoy the sesame chicken. It is not your traditional sesame chicken. This place is very accommodating for groups and is a favorite of my 9 year old daughter. Upon several visits someone has recognized us and given my daughter a fun shaped orange after her meal. The only thing that I dislike is the reservation policy. I have waited an hour for a table in a restaurant that was mostly empty because someone had made a reservations and not showed for them. Other than that, it's amazing! Oh and the house salad is to die for!"}
{"text":"The sushi is definitely worth the price. It's in a nice office building. Not too crowded on the weekdays. Lunch hours 12-4. Wait time is short. I'm from NJ and this is definitely the best sushi I ever had."}
{"text":"Lunch combo - 2 maki rolls and salad for $9.  Cant beat it. One of my favorite lunch spots right in the center of uptown."}
{"text":"Amazing place, I love it. The spring rolls and the miso soup was my favorites. All wok are well prepare and super delicious."}
{"text":"So had just wrapped up a gig in Charlotte and as part of my year tenure in Charlotte, I had tried many places for food including Room 112. It was conveniently located next to the office building I had to work out of and it was a place where I knew I could grab food quickly as the service is quick. On top of this, it is probably one of the very few sushi joints in the uptown area so it adds a check mark for convenience. The joint itself is fairly small with only a small sushi bar spot with 5 stools and then tables to serve around 30ish people total within the restaurant itself.  The servers here are all nice and I am grateful that they would always remember my drink order. I would always get the tuna tartare with avocado and then an eclectic mix of sashimi. During my many times here, I have had the tuna, salmon, mackerel, uni (when available), and the list goes on. The appetizer is simple and comes drizzled with a tasty sauce. It is standard fare and a nice starting dish. For all the sashimi, I think the quality is OK. Some days it is better and other days it does taste a \"bit fishy\" with that after frozen feel to it. The ratio of fish to rice is solid which is appreciated but I think the biggest hurdle is that their inventory of sashimi is hit or miss depending on the week you go. There have been many times where they have not had a few of the cuts of fish that I wanted which  I understand as I am sure sashimi is not a \"big thing\" in Charlotte given  the demographics. The rolls (although I have not had any) look good and lots of people seem to order that vs what I was ordering.  All in all, Room 112 was an OK spot that is certainly convenient. Definitely worth checking  out for the lunch time as there seem to be many specials making it a good deal for professionals."}
{"text":"Soups were great, ordered the Wonton and Seafood Hot and Sour. The Seafood Hot and Sour was so good we are going back this weekend for more.  Edamame was okay but the Gyoza were fabulous! Sushi was good too! Great vibe!"}
{"text":"get the pink floyd roll!  i love 112!  when i worked uptown we went at least twice a week - everything i have had was fantastic. keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Felt obligated to update my review because after that one incident I have been back many times and have not had any further issues. The cooked food here is tasty and fresh and inexpensive. I can't say the same for the sashimi though, the several times that I did get sashimi, the fish tasted mushy and not fresh. This is my go to spot for Chinese food now and you cannot go wrong with their Broccoli and chicken/tofu which is what I get at least once a week. The crispy tofu with the dipping sauce is AMAZING as well."}
{"text":"I have been really excited to come here, and even more excited when I saw a $18 for $30 worth of sushi on Groupon. This place has definitely taken one of the top spots of my Charlotte sushi restaurants.   The sushi was beautifully presented and the flavor was amazing. So fresh and the service was amazing. Getting not the building was also very impressive. You walk down a lavish hallway to get here"}
{"text":"Sushi is super good. This place is always packed during lunch so arrive early. Not the cheapest sushi option but about the same price as everywhere else in uptown. Never been upset about the service, solid choice for sushi."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and the presentation of the food is beautiful.  And along with great aesthetics is great food.  It was fresh and delicious with all that we ordered.  We got the spring rolls, dumplings, teriyaki shrimp and Singapore rice noodles.  We will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I went here a couple of days ago and have been 2x since my stay in Charlotte.  Just started a yelp account, so I'm now posting my experience.    The young girl working the register for take out was really helpful and nice.  I explained it was my first time, and that I'm pregnant, so there are things I want to modify and she was great.  The 'chefs' didn't speak, like I'm used to in LA, most sushi bars/restaurants when you walk in, the whole staff yells something in japanese, saying 'hello!\" or 'welcome.\" maybe it's a west coast thing.  But I thanked them on my way out and they were nice and smiled.  My second time back, I think they recognized me from the first time, and were much more friendly. :) Said 'hello' and 'goodbye' on my way in and out.   Now onto the food: I ordered the crunchy shrimp tempura roll- it had avocado and crab in it.  Was really good.  But I give it 1 STAR.  WHY??? B/c and maybe it's just me but...  THEY DO NOT TAKE THE VEIN/POOP LINE out of their shrimp.  I even went back the next day and ordered it again, thinking it was a fluke and nope.  That long string of black tar was hanging out of each of my rolls.  Sorry.  But de-vein the shrimp folks!! Please.  Not doing so ruins the meal, at least for true sushi/roll fanatics.    Miso soup- was tasty.  hard to mess that up.   The best thing I had was the Chicken lettuce wraps.  DELICIOUS.   I'm sure the lettuce isn't organic, so it's probably sprayed with mad GMO's that would make me faint if I knew the truth...but I just pretended that it was from Whole Foods or Farmer's market and scarfed them down.    Not sure how the sushi is, b/c I'm pregnant and didn't bother.  But if you get shrimp.  Watch out for the POOP line lol"}
{"text":"Wow better than expected!  Stopped in here last night for a birthday dinner and was pleasantly surprised.  We had the edamame appetizer - came out warm and perfect!  I had the Crunchy roll and the Spider roll - both fantastic!!    The rolls were put together beautifully and were the perfect size.  I hate sushi rolls that are too big!!!  Our waitress was a doll and worked with our large group perfectly.  This place may be a little hard to find if you are not familiar with Uptown.  It's address is Tryon but there are two entrances.  They put out placards on the street to help you and I am pretty sure they have valet parking!  Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Ok. I found my go-to sushi / Asian food restaurant! I was skeptical with the Chinese food plus Japanese food combo. I've been to many of these types of restaurants that have resorted to low quality sushi. This place was surprisingly not like the rest!  Fantastic service. Other than a couple order mistakes, our server was warm, incredibly polite, patient, attentive, generous... She actually provided the best service I have experienced in Charlotte yet! Should've gotten her name.   We ordered a plethora of sushi, and judging by the cleanliness of the place, felt the urge to have some Chinese as well. We ordered the battered shrimp with coconut sauce and the salt and pepper shrimp. Both were amazing and served with perfectly cooked Jasmine rice. (It actually felt like some sort of rice that fell between jasmine and basmati).  I'm a rice fiend, so, this certainly stood out to me. (Don't worry, the sushi was true to its beautiful sushi rice)  The shrimp was nicely battered. The batter was thick, but not overly oily/greasy. Tasty without feeling like it was soaked in MSG.   I found the coconut sauce to be just perfectly sweet. Not too much and not fatty like other mayo based dressings you find at most Chinese restaurants.   All in all. I was thrilled. (Btw, I'm Asian. So... I feel I'm a worthy critic) haha.   Can't wait to come back here again!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. My husband and I drove from Greenville, SC to have datenight here. We walked in and it was empty. They sat us down and walked away. We picked the rolls we wanted and waited for them to at least ask for our drink orders. Nothing for 10 minutes. My husband got really upset, so we just walked out. Not only did we waste our time, gas and parking money, the waitresses could care less as we walked away since they continued to have their conversation. It's sad we didn't even get to try their sushi.. The owners should really consider getting better staff!"}
{"text":"I like to come here for lunch during the week- very conveniently located (walking distance to most of Uptown) and reasonably priced with big portions. Try the Street Noodles!"}
{"text":"Don't even wanna leave a star the staff is terrible. Super distract with other staff and fails to attend customers or even bother to take the order. These people get paid to do nothing."}
{"text":"If you're seeking semi-decent lunch with horrible service this is the place for you! Active management? No, little girls running the show full of attitude with zero care in the world. The place could be burning down around them & they wouldn't notice. I served for a decade and even I could see (from my situational awareness) that tables needed pre-bussing, drinks needed refills, patrons needed checks, or simply to see their server once in a blue moon. I've been dragged here multiple times and every time I think why do I or others even come here? The sad truth is because its close by, location location location. But if you choose to dine at Room 112 bring your patience pants, those little stank faced employees will grind your gears. Love to see where they end up, lord knows real life will swallow them alive."}
{"text":"All the rolls we got were excellent! We couldn't pick a favorite if we had to. We got the crunchy California, Pink Floyd, firecracker and sexy salmon rolls."}
{"text":"Dinner was good.  Sashimi smoked salmon wasn't melt in your mouth good like other places I've been to but the California crunch was full of flavor.  Cucumber salad was refreshing.  Staff very short when speaking to you but not in a bad way.  Guess busy night."}
{"text":"I was in town for a business meeting with my boss and we met at Room 112.  I had sushi and she had steak.  We both really enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere.  The location was a little confusing with it being inside a SunTrust location (I believe), but once you find it - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good sushi/Kinda-affordable/friendly staff. DO not go here if you have large groups! Went with a group (with a reservation) for 20 and waited over an hour for food to come-out."}
{"text":"By far best sushi in charlotte! Came for my best friend's bday and can definitely say it was well worth it. Room 112 roll is amazing. Martinis are perfect for a girls night! Cannot wait to return!!! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Room 112 would be pretty perfect if your $25 got you a little further than it does. I find that even when you splurge on the food here, you're only getting a small portion. I suppose it's a good change from the wastage and mass-production of Lean Cuisine in this country, but an extra slice of fish didn't kill anyone did it?  Everything about this place is \"clean\" from the the Asian decor, to the sharp black dress of the waiting staff and not to-mention the quality of ingredients. Sushi needs to be crisp on the palate, not overpowered by the rice, wasabi, or soy and this is definitely the case at Room 112. Delicious sushi dishes with vibrant presentation. You'll spend a lot of time on the menu since the difference between one roll to the next is literally one ingredient. You could probably order any sushi roll and be satisfied (nigiri or maki). I tend to stay away from the cream cheese as that's just an insult to fresh fish.   There's an enticing \"Rouge\" hue to this place that makes your eating experience all the better. I would recommend you accompany every meal with a bottle of sake (warm or cold). My favorite is the Ozeki Nigori sake, as it's very very reasonably priced, flavorsome and light.   As for the other dishes on the menu, the most appetizing dishes are the \"Specialties,\" which push me away just because of the price tag even though they're scrumptious. This kind of restaurant can't justify a $20 duck dish. Just look at the people around you. I'm walking in with a t-shirt and jeans for a light dinner. I didn't realize it was gonna burn a hole in my pocket. To be quite frank, you'll have to drop $30 here to sample the best of the best. After all, why wouldn't you want the best they have to offer? So be prepared!  Go for the Passion and Cherry Blossom as rolls Singapore Rice Noodles Any of the Teriyaki Grill items Kalbi or Miso Sea Bass  Enjoy!  4/5"}
{"text":"Great sushi and reasonably priced. Comfy seating as well. A little tucked away, but great find while traveling to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Tucked away to the point of you literally could live here for years and never know it was there, Room 112 is a hidden little gem.  I've walked by and noticed it but never felt the need to eat there but finally had the chance last week.  I walked away pretty impressed with the place.   The sushi was really good but my sea bass entree left me wanting more unfortunately.  I mean it was fine, but just fine.  The service was fantastic and our waitress kept up with our large group table perfectly.  If I were to go back I would just stick to the sushi side of the menu probably.  Parking is tough here.  They have valet but it's just a guy out on South Tryon sitting in a car apparently.  No official valet stand."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me to Room 112 for dinner a few weeks ago for the first time. The atmosphere here was really neat, with music at the right volume, great lighting, and comfortable leather seating.   We are both big fans of sushi and this is one of her favorite spots in the city so I elected to oblige her request to join her here. The restaurant is not very large, but the space is utilized quite well.   Our waiter was terrific! We struggled to decide on our entree for a bit and he was incredibly patient. We both enjoyed a glass of cabernet as we decided and conversed about sushi. The pricing was competitive for the quality of sushi we selected. We did not have to wait to be seated and yet it was still busy for a week night.   Excellent restaurant. Excellent sushi. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Good price and no long wait. Very happy I chose to go here!"}
{"text":"Kind of hidden from the plain view, this restaurant is quite worth a visit.  Reasonably priced and above-average quality!  Try fried calamari, and some of their special rolls."}
{"text":"I'm usually a big fan of this place and have visited multiple times in the past.  I had lunch there on Saturday with 5 other coworkers and although the food was really good the service was absolutely terrible.  The place was not very busy so serving the few people in the restaurant shouldn't have been a hard task.   If the waiter could put down his phone and actually pay attention to customers it would have been nice.  And the hostess was absolutely worthless, I don't think she looked up from her phone the entire time we were in the place."}
{"text":"So I'm not sure why this place has high remarks, but hey maybe I have high expectations or don't know what I'm talking out.   So first off, this place was impossible to find, I should of taken it as a sign to eat else where when I walked past it the first 2 times but I was craving sushi and determined to get my fix.  Once inside the I was shocked how small it was but I didn't mind because I enjoy cozy spaces only it wasn't very much cozy.  There was a larger party of about 8-9 ppl that was just finishing up and one person at the bar. Me and my fiancé causally sat our selves as instructed at one of the nearby booths. Immediately my eyes met some sticky spots on the floor and wall.  The tables were clean though and we were quickly asked our drinks.  After ordering drinks I decided on a salmon maki roll (can't remember the name), some pieces of salmon and tuna nigiri, a cup of miso soup, and a spring roll. My fiancé ordered Kung PO shrimp and a Stella to drink. My miso soup came out flavorful and spring roll crisp and delicious. My entree' however, could of been better. My maki rolls were blah. I went to reach over for some soy sauce and they both, the regular and low sodium was near empty. I then when and tried my nigiri pieces and they didn't taste as fresh as I expected. I looked over and asked my fiancé how his food tasted and he replied it was lacking flavor, and disappointed by the small portion. Let just say we were not impressed.  We were now the only ppl in the store other than the guy at the bar. With that being said it took our waitress a expected to get our checks and payment taken care of. Meanwhile the party's used dishes from earlier still sat on the table.. A good 15 mins had passed since they had left.. Maybe everyone was on break?  Overall not a great dining out experience from the service to the ambiance and food. Maybe they were having an off night or that they are just another overrated uptown restaurant."}
{"text":"Best spicy tuna roll in Charlotte, hands down.   Room 112 is my favorite sushi in Uptown and ranks highly for me in Charlotte overall. It's great for lunch, though often busy. Go early or be prepared to wait in the adjoining lobby.  The sushi combo lunch can't be beat: two maki rolls and a side salad for $9. I can't speak to the rest of the menu as I'm always in the sushi mindset when I visit, but everything that comes out of the kitchen looks wonderful.   For my fellow gluten free diners, they carry GF soy sauce and aren't stingy at all with serving it.   I've been fortunate to have consistently great service at Room 112. I've gone for rushed lunches and leisurely dinners in parties of two to six and have found that my servers have been in tune with our pace each time.   AND you get a delightful Andes mint with your check, which -- while seemingly in contrast with the Asian fusion menu -- is a real treat."}
{"text":"A bit hard to find but well worth the hunt! In town for work and always look for a good sushi place, saw the reviews and thought we should check it out. We were sat right away and service was fast and friendly!  The sashimi was fresh and absolutely delicious. Definitely try the white tuna sashimi and salmon nigiri- two of our groups favorite choices of the evening. They have very inventive rolls- Upper Manhattan roll was awesome! No rice and was wrapped in cucumber. Overall all of the rolls had minimal rice as a filler and really emphasized the fish.   Everything was reasonably priced and came out fast and was presented beautifully. Will definitely go back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Just ate at this place it was so nice! It wasn't too busy, the sushi was incredibly fresh and reasonably priced!   We wanted a quick dinner cause we had plans and our waiter was super speedy! Definitely coming back. I recommend the Dragon Roll and the Gyoza (fried)."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi, that I have had uptown.  I went once alone, after a conference.  I was the only one in the restaurant so it was extra cool and chic. The sushi was fresh, and flavorful, especially at their price point, which I appreciated. Another time we went, my soon to be husband planned a double date and proposed after dinner. The dinner that night was better than my first visit, not just the experience, but the food itself lol. So aside from the delicious sushi, this place will always be special for us."}
{"text":"Awesome teriyaki chicken with brown rice. The veggies are fresh and crisp. The secret sauce is just right, not too overwhelming. Not too sweet, not too tart. Oh sooo good! Fish is fresh, usually have the sashimi. I do have to say that the tuna is not consistent."}
{"text":"Solid choice for takeout downtown but it didn't blow my mind. Ordered chicken teriyaki, steamed gyoza, the 112 roll, and the crunchy California roll. Rolls are well-sized, and the chicken teriyaki gave me leftovers for the next day as well."}
{"text":"The sushi is yummy. The staff at the sushi bar is very friendly but the other staffs such as the host and waitresses are VERY RUDE!!! If these staff goes to a bigger city they will not survive more than a day. These people need to learn some customer service skills. I ate there, paid and I had to be the bigger person to say thank you to the staff because I will not make myself low class like them. The Asian host is super rude kept giving dirty looks and the Asian waitress didn't even bother saying hi to any customers even when I smile to her. Why are they so rude??? You're just a server!"}
{"text":"Still my go to sushi spot downtown after enso dropped the ball.  For this little occassion, my apartment building was having a social event and Saki bombs and sushi was on the menu.  Never had a saki bomb until then..........not bad........should keep that on my drinking list for the future.  The funniest thing about this entire visit was the manager/owner...was doing saki bomb every round.  She'd set them up and do it.  Tiny little thing she was and got a little stinky, which I thought was VERY cool!  Sushi was good.....saki bomb was better........still my neighborhood Sushi place!"}
{"text":"Amaaaaaaazing sushi! Pink Floyd was our fave! Visiting from out of town and this place lived up to every expectation and more!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi place in uptown. The price is reasonable and the fish is fresh. I took one star off for the long wait time. There was empty tables and we still had to wait 30 min."}
{"text":"Can't say a bad thing about Room 112. Reviews on Yelp were mixed... A lot of comments about the size of the restaurant. I chose 112 over Fujo and Enso based on Yelp, and I'm glad that I did.    I came around 8PM on a Tuesday night, and while all of the seats at the sushi bar were occupied (all 6 of them...), there were only 2 other parties seated at tables. In my opinion, and having been to some small sushi bars, this place is just the right size. About 15 tables, mostly 4-tops, which means that the chefs can handle their guests and you can still feel like you're not just dining at home.  The maki rolls I ordered were good (nothing incredible, but the fish was fresh) and the service was excellent. Prices were respectable as well (keeping in mind that I'm used to prices in the DC market...).  Would absolutely recommend, and will return to again."}
{"text":"This is my all time to go place for sushi when I'm in Charlotte for work. Today marks my 5th time here in the past year alone. I really wanted to give this place a 5 stars but my meal today did not live my expectations.   The good: I came in with a group of 7 people and we were seated right away without any fuss. The time it took from ordering and receiving the food didn't take that long for a medium size group like ours. Both of my rolls and sashimi were pretty fresh, which is a MUST for any sushi restaurants. The atmosphere here was pretty trendy and casual.   The bad: for some reason the seaweed in my sushi roll was a bit hard chew, which was something I never noticed before in any sushi rolls I had, and I am an avid sushi lover.      Overall a good place to come to have a casual meal and enjoy pretty good quality sushi."}
{"text":"Thanks atmosphere gets a 10   food is good for the price but nothing special.  The service is questionable our table was never cleared while from course to course. My wife never got her second sushi roll. I had high hopes."}
{"text":"The sushi was good, the staff was friendly and attentive, and the price was worth it.   (I don't enjoy writing negative reviews)  One major problem though. The place was a mess. I walked in around 9:15 p.m on a Friday night and it was moderately busy. A little over half the tables were full. The tables that were not full were not bussed and dirty dishes stayed there the entire time I was there.   Most notably, I sat at the small bar which seats about 7. I sat on the end and the 6 seats to my right were a disaster. Every seat had someone sitting at it at one point and the dirty dishes stayed there for the entire 35 or so minutes I was there. This is unacceptable.  It was not nearly busy enough where they couldn't keep up and even if it were, there is still no excuse.   The hours say they are open till 10. As I was leaving around 9:45 a couple walked in and were told the kitchen was closed. If your open till 10, you should serve till 10. But then again, even if they wanted to seat them any open tables were filled with dirty dishes.   The food could be great but a bad aura with a lazy staff not clearing tables and bar spots makes for a bad place."}
{"text":"The first two times I ate here for lunch my stomach hurt all night. Hopefully the third time is a charm. The rolls are good and sushi sized so it fits in your mouth easily. I normally get the crunchy (4-5 pieces) and spicy tuna (6 pieces). The lunch special is a good deal as you get two maki rolls and a house salad."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Not only is the sushi excellent, the drinks are good and the bartenders go all out...big glasses of wine, strong drinks. The staff is SO nice, part of the reason I keep coming back here is because I love the atmosphere. Everyone is friendly, accommodating, know the menu well.   This also needs to be repeated because it is obviously crucial: the food is delicious. I have had various types of sushi, noodles, anything that I order here is surprisingly good. The kind of good that makes you eat every single thing in front of you and leave painfully full; but it is worth it! Not many sushi places that are this great in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are TOTALLY in love with this sushi restaurant! The staff is great; the venue is cute, upbeat and modern. We LOVE the sushi it's absolutely amazing and always fresh. We eat here at least twice a month and are always confident to take our friends visiting from out of town here because we know they will be PERFECT every time!"}
{"text":"I haven't had anything here except the Singapore Noodles and chopsticks down it is the best in town.  Flavorful with bite-sized chunks of chicken, shrimp, egg & the moist, yummy goodness of a mild yellow curry.  It's a good sized bowl & I get the duck sauce on the side just to dip the chicken in every so often for a little different flavor."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick spot to have lunch on Saturday. They place was very quite, we sat at the bar and had fresh fast great sushi. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Traveling in from out of state I had a great dinner at a very reasonable price.   I will definitely come back on my next trip.   Thank you for the great service."}
{"text":"Good place to eat with friends or a loved one. It's small and hidden too.   The sushi and sashimi is fresh and tasty. Service was ok. Dessert options are limited."}
{"text":"So good! The service was friendly, sushi rolls were fresh & delicious, not doused in sauce. The salt & pepper calamari was among the best calamari I've ever had.  I noticed a lot of takeout orders sitting around on the counter waiting to be picked up but I'd recommend eating in here. The atmosphere felt a bit trendy but was also quite cozy."}
{"text":"The service is a 2, the sushi is a 4....we'll meet in the middle at 3.   Room 112 is tucked away quietly uptown but it's a great little gem once you find it. They have a ginormous menu and reasonable prices and for that alone it's a good place to feed your inner sushi monster (we all have one...)   The decor is very cozy and comfortable. It's a small venue but it was really great for an intimate group dinner.   We had a group of 9 and all ordered various drinks. In the beginning our server was on the ball and even let me sample their plum wine before committing (some are too sweet for my liking). After our order was placed he seemed distant and overwhelmed. He never asked us if we wanted dessert (which two of us did) he just brought the bill and completely botched everyone's check charging people for dishes they didn't order...including my poor friends who left early and ended up getting charged for my boyfriends meal. Our server was very quiet and overall just not present at all....perhaps his 20% gratuity charge was reason for his lack of service ?   The food was delicious. I had bites of pho, several rolls ( get the cherry blossom) and the sesame chicken. Though the pho wasn't my cup of tea, the rest were delicious. They even managed to turn a couple sushi-phobes into full fledged fans.   I'll return and hope that the poor service was just a fluke!"}
{"text":"Small but comfortable and very nice interior space, in this historic First National Bank building.  On the trip through the lobby back to the entrance, you pass by some very nice architectural features of this building.  Don't forget to look it over.  Menu very complete with reasonable prices; I was expecting smallish portions, but they were generous - 8 pieces for a Koishi roll?  Pretty good.  Tried a couple selections, both were delicious.   Had to cut the Nigiri (my choice: yellowtail) in half to eat it.  Service was fast.  Good tip.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went with a party of five. I had wonton soup, scallops, and the tataki steak sushi roll. Everything was great. My only complaint is that the waitress forgot to bring my salad which I watched the rest of my party enjoy."}
{"text":"I swung by Room 112 today and decided to order take-out and take it back to my hotel room instead of dining in. The place is small and I didn't really like the vibe. I sat at the bar and perused the menu a little. The hostess took my order and was nice and gave me some great suggestions. However, I didn't take her up on any of her suggested menu items. I'm pretty satisfied with what I ordered. I decided to order the volcano salad, a spicy scallop and the leap roll.   I really loved the volcano salad. It had a mixture of seaweed salad, crabmeat and cucumbers and masago. Uber good! Not too much mayo and was light and had a crunch to it with some small pieces of what seemed like fried tempura batter. The spicy scallop handroll was fresh and loved how you get scallop in every bite. It wasn't spicy and I would have preferred some heat since they called it a spicy. I devoured the leap roll because it had all of my favorite fish. It had spicy salmon, yellowtail, white tuna, avocado, crunch, red tobiko, masago, and a spicy aioli. Although, again, the aioli was not spicy as indicated. However, I am not complaining because the roll was still very good and fresh.  The rolls are sliced smaller than what I'm used to but they are perfect for me. In Texas, everything is bigger and that even goes for the sushi slices. I got full off of the leap roll but forced myself to try the spicy scallop and snacked on the salad throughout the night."}
{"text":"It's not the most traditional sushi place, but it's pretty delicious. I love the 2 types of Manhattan rolls (wrapped in cucumber, instead of rice). If you come here right at lunch time, expect it to be packed and maybe even having to wait, but if you're craving sushi in Charlotte, this is probably your best option."}
{"text":"It was a sushi kind of day today so my girlfriend and I went to Room 112. I had something different today. I had the volcano salad which had cucumbers, grab and seaweed. It was nice and refreshing. The crab part had a kick to it that I wasn't prepared for but it was still good. The cucumbers still had a nice crunch to it. I had the spider roll which I thought would be as good as the firecracker roll but it wasn't. I think what got me was the lettuce on it. The service this time was much better than our last visit. We were greeted right away. Hostess brought us menus right as we sat down at the bar. Got our food right away and still had about 15 minutes left on our lunch break to relax after we ate. That's definitely how it should be. Thanks for a much better service! 6/6/18"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed .  I want to love this place for  work lunches.  My friend and I met at 11:45 for lunch.  I grabbed two seats at the bar.  We ordered our lunch right away.  I ordered the sushi lunch special.  It was a simple order two spicy tuna rolls.  This comes with a salad.  My friend ordered the broccoli and fried rice.  My salad came out quickly.  My friends broccoli and fried rice came out about 10 minutes after my salad, but my spicy tuna took 25 minutes.  When I got it the rolls were really really small (see picture). They didn't apologize for the wait for my food.  I will be going back to Fujos going forward."}
{"text":"Room 112 has quickly become one of my Top 5 places in Charlotte and a clear Number 1 in the Sushi category.  We tend to go there at least 4 times/month.  The typical order for my wife and I is:  1 bottle of Sean Minor Pinor Nior, 2 orders of the Spicy Tuna Nigiri (equals 4 pieces), 1 Pink Floyd Roll,  and then we pick a different random roll each time.  Sometimes we'll grab a Volcano Roll but substitute the California beneath it with something different, most often a Crunchy California.  We try to ask for Brandon each time... takes excellent care of us!  I've been wanting to try other dishes but it's hard to stray from such a great trend we've started.  Room 112 has quickly become the clear Sushi favorite for us in Charlotte and even when we sample some national favorites like Oishii in Boston, we find ourselves still preferring the sushi at 112.  Update:   We now order the K5 (named after my wife and I).  I think if you guys start ordering they'll have to add it to the menu.  Brandon will know what you are talking about!  (has Tempura Shrimp, Avacado, Jalapeno Slice, and more... You'll Love.)"}
{"text":"Sushi was fine. However, I would not recommend for takeout. Spent $25 on two small rolls of sushi that were not at worth the money. I am sure it would be a fine place to have dinner if you are paying for the experience and not just the food."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends for a birthday dinner. One, issue about this restaurant is that they don't validate parking. Other, than that we had a good experience. The service was good. The restaurant is small and narrow.   I ordered the seafood hot and sour soup. It was ok. A little overpriced and not at all what I thought it was. The seafood was shredded. I got the steak tataki and crunchy roll. Both were good and I loved the steak tataki roll. I would definitely get that again. One plus is when I asked for chili oil, they gave me a decent amount! Sometimes when I ask for it at other places, they give me the smallest amount."}
{"text":"Went here after having a bad experience at another place in town and we liked it much better as far as service went. They were very busy- it was friday night after all- but were able to get two seats at the sushi bar. The space overall is very small. Wait staff was frazzled yet friendly, got our spring rolls out fast enough but they were piping hot. Took drink order after food order- odd but again they were busy and had two large groups of around 10. The sushi we got was good. not the best I have had but decent enough. I would go back here if I lived in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Decent sushi - good prices- don't expect good service and hope you enjoy loud club music."}
{"text":"A lot of people don't know this place even exists. It's tucked away on a corner at Trade and Tryon.  I've been here several times for group dinners. Most recently, on Saturday night for a birthday. The space is pretty small, so it does fill up quite quickly.  Pretty sure I've had almost every roll on the menu. Everything is great. I get something different each time. The ingredients are fresh and delicious. I always get sushi when I come here, but the menu also has noodles, fried rice, wok, hibachi, specialty, etc type dishes.  We go through a lot of hot house saki every trip here. I think the staff gets a big kick out of watching our group.  It can be a little pricey to eat here. My friend and I had drinks (maybe a saki added in there too.. can't remember now), two rolls, few pieces of nigiri, miso soups... with gratuity added it was about $80.  If you work/live/stay uptown, this is a great place to walk to for a sushi fix. Parking may be a little challenging if you have to drive. On the weekends, there is a valet. Week nights... parking on the street (if you can find it) is free after 6pm. A lot of the garages around there though are just $5."}
{"text":"This is definitely a solid Asian fusion place!  They have very good sushi rolls and sashimi.  They also make a great variety of Asian food from Chinese, Thai, and Japanese style food.  When I go I usually get their sushi rolls:  I love their: -Spicy tuna and salmon roll -Scallop roll and yellow tail roll -Tempura roll: Shrimp tempura at its best inside a tastey roll!  I have also tired their dishes.  Here are some must tries: -Seasme chicken and beef!  -Kung Pow Chicken (a bit spicy) -Mango chicken (I love their awesome mango sauce)  The workers and wait staff here are very nice and quick to serve you!  I will be here very frequently.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here! We had the cherry blossoms sushi and few other things! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants I've been to in years, inclusive of some of the best spots in L.A. and S.F.  They don't offer omakase, but the nigiri is excellent. I started with edamame and some cold saki, which hit the spot. I followed with toro, sake, etc and it was unbelievable.   Go. You won't regret it..."}
{"text":"Went to Room 112 a few weeks ago on one of my nights out. We arrived around 7:30 and while the place wasn't packed the waitresses seem a little disorganized. The waiter we had while slow and was very nice and polite.    We ordered soups(seafood soup), appetizer(the salt and pepper shrimp), and 2 sushi rolls.  The soup was awesome, the salt and pepper shrimp a little under whelming more like the what you would get when ordering hot and sour chicken without the sauce..just some pepper sprinkled on top.  The sushi rolls were pretty good.  Overall I would return if asked or in the area and needing a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! This was my 1st time here and I'm positive I will never return. My family and I had to wait over 45 minutes for our food after we ordered. Whiich was then  completely wrong when we did finally get it, and that was after we waited 25 minutes just to be seated at a table. Meanwhile groups of 2 and single people were taken in front of us and seated. The waitress never check back on our table after she brought the food, she never refilled a drink. We had to go to the counter to get our bill.  It was as if we were a plague and she was trying to avoid us at all cost. She never asked how our food was or if we need to go boxes nothing! Once I looked at our check I then noticed she automatically apply a 20% tip for herself! Knowing she completely ignored not only our table but forgot half of our order as well. FYI** If you have a party of 6 or more they charge gratuity. We were not told this when we were seated, even if you have children under the age of 6.  3 out of the 7 of us were kids, 1 an infant, who did not eat. The other 2 children shared a bowl of rice. I was shocked that someone would allow their employees to treat customers this way. Go there if you want but please be aware of the way they operate. There's a lot of other hibachi restaurants that value customers and want to give you a good experience."}
{"text":"Came here for my dirty thirty b-day and got completely sloshed.  I don't remember how the food was despite it being restaurant week.  It's a difficult place to find when you enter the building but easier to spot from the street.    Could be a solid 4 stars if the service staff knew their drinks. That is, one friend ordered a martini, she didn't want it dirty. They gave it to her dirty.  Later, another friend showed up asking for martini neat - and again, splashed with olive juice.  They gotta learn their mixology.  Overall, solid place to have a bday - for whatever reason they weren't too crazy busy so my group and I got rowdy and had a good time.  dmo out"}
{"text":"Sushi chef sitting on a box.  Beer not imported from Japan.  Average service at best.  Came with someone who has been to Japan 50 times and he won't go past a beer and edamame brans.  This isn't your night out place. This is 'you buddy wants a roll or two' place.  Can't tell you about the sushi because the Service and atmosphere didn't get us to that point.  Good for take out than a upscale eat in."}
{"text":"This place was really small.  The suishi was ok.  It was late night so I will give it the benefit of the doubt.  I had the cucumber roll (actually yellowtail in cucumber) and a dragon roll.  I wasn't to impressed but it wasn't horrible either.  I would say give it a shot yourself. I don't think my first visit was that impressionable."}
{"text":"Food awesome.  Service slow, but polite.  ALWAYS SLAMMED.  Be patient.  Cool SE Asian Hipster Crowd."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with our food here. I had heard good things but it did not live up to what we heard. I ordered a sushi roll and a mango chicken and the chicken dish was very bland"}
{"text":"Well hello friends!  Let me start out by saying when I'm eating I'm thinking about my next meal.  Today i was super duper hungry and didnt' know what I wanted. So Yelp to the rescue. I wanted some greasy food but i wanted something light.  I read some reviews and ended up at this place. - Room 112 (after all, that is where the playa's dwell. @ least thats what Biggie Small said) After using my GPS (Thanks protestors for making me walk around uptown to avoid you)  Anyway, i read a review from Demetria M. saying sushi COMBO. So i walked in asking, \"Do you have any specials, or lunch special/combo's?\".  Answer - NO, our prices are \"special friendly\"  WHAT DA WHAT??? I don't even know what that mean but.... OK. (even though I know their is one) I was told to sit at the other bar for Dine Out. (a whole 2 bar stools over). I placed my order (Spicey Crab Roll & Rainbow Chicken... see photo).  After about 2 mins. I get a tap on the shoulder. Can you move BACK over there to the other bar (a whooping 4 feet over). @ this point I'm looking around for Aston Kutcher. Are you serious wth, \"Yeah, I know, I thought you were dining in\" WHAT?? HUH?? How did you gather that? Was it the fact that when I came in i said it was TAKE OUT?  anyway... After walking 4 or 5 blocks back to the gig, I was very pleased w/ what they packed in the bag. A WHOLE LOTTA FOOD!!... and still STEAMING HOT!  ** When I was signing my tab, the SAMEEEE GAL came talking about some, \"Ya know we have pretty good special! OPENS another MENU & points out the combo Demetria spoke about.   MANNNN LET ME OUTTA HERE, I DON'T WANNA BE ON THIS SHOW ANYMORE. YOU ALL ARE PLAYIN W/ MY MIND AND HUNGRY STOMACH. and my stomach is NOT to be played with. lol..LOL..LOL  I'LL RETURN... but i DON'T want to play mary-go-round or hide and seek the lunch special/combo."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  I have only been for lunch, but the sushi is fresh and amazing.  I always choose Room 112 when I am in the mood for sushi.  (It beats Enso hands down.)  They have a great lunch deal with two maki rolls and a salad for just $8.95.  I love the spicy salmon and crunchy (shrimp tempura with cream cheese).  Service is attentive and efficient,  although sometimes I feel like they are anxious for me to finish so they can turn over my table.  It's small inside, so no wonder.  Highly recommended nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Disappointing on several accounts. We had a $25 Groupon that was supposed to get us $50.00 of food. There was NO WAY that could happen as it was limited to 3 rolls and 1 appetizer.   At average price of $9.00 - $10 a roll (for the more expensive ones) and $8 for appetizer. There was NO WAY you could combing 4 items to come anywhere close to $50 let alone barely matching $25 we paid for.   Then we had to pay for drinks ($2.00 for a green tea leaf bag). Total was $29.00 for about $35.00 of food.   My complaint thus far of course, is mainly with the lack of value of the Groupon.   The rolls themselves were fine and presented nicely and visually appealing.   Would have been better to skip Groupon and have more options. However we did learn of a new place we may go back to.   Other negative is its very small. I could barely fit into the first couples table they seated us in (no, I'm not fat either!). We had to ask for a more spacious table just to have some elbow room. They can seat 42 people at their tables but they're packed so tightly we could barely walk out without having to inconvenience others to scoot in.   It's okay, the smallness of it, so-so service, and average food was not quite worth while and perhaps if they focused on service they would not need Groupon to advertise for them."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch often and I've enjoyed it everytime!  Sushi combo's for lunch are good sizes and they come pretty fast so you're not waisting your precious lunch time hour waiting!  Service is nice and pleasant as well.  Would recommend going at 11:30 if you are going during a work week.  Place gets crowded fast!"}
{"text":"A little surprised at the 4 star rating this place has.  Maybe it was the time I went, maybe it was because this was following up a phenomenal brazilian bbq experience the night before (see my Chima review).  Fish was ok, but not the freshest I've had.    My server was kind of friendly, but she never came to check on me.  I had to keep asking them for things.  Although a trendy atmosphere, the staff's overall uninterested attitude makes for an underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"Love the steak tataki roll..one of the best rolls I have ever had and was able to finish the whole thing.  Delicious.  I originally ordered the pad thai, which was awful! Do not order it! It is very disappointing.  The waitress was very nice and quickly replaced it.  She said many people think it tastes different from the traditional.  The side salad and dressing was amazing.  The miso soul was also a plus.  I went on a week night and it was moderately busy.  Our party was sat right away.  I was pleased with the service and the quickness of the food coming out.  Now if they would just validate parking!!!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my experience at room 112! We went because we had a Groupon. A $17 groupon that covers $30 worth of sushi. The sushi was some of the best that I've had in Charlotte! Our waiter was smiling the entire night and was very friendly. It was a great place to go for a date. On the smaller side but we didn't have to wait on a Friday night and very intimate. I will say they were out of my first three choices of beer and it was slightly difficult to find. But it was a great spot in uptown and I'd go back!"}
{"text":"I switch between Room 112 and Enso for uptown sushi. Room 112 is smaller than Enso but has a great menu. I think the prices are better than Enso and the spicy tuna is more to my liking than others. If you go, get there before noon or you will be waiting!"}
{"text":"I liked this place quite a bit. The ginger dressing was so good that I finished my whole salad (which never happens). The soft shell crab came out smothered in sauce which was disappointing but turned out tasting excellent. The sushi was good although the the eel wasn't as I would hope for. But everything else made up for the eel. I absolutely despise going uptown but if I ever am, I'll be coming here."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for good company! Though the service was great... the rest was.. not so much. First strike: the filthiest wine glass I have ever seen. And I normally don't pay attention to such things.. good thing I did!! Secondly, the ginger dressing was quite odd. Not what Im used to, and very 'mayonaise-y' (creamy).  And while the rolls were quite good, nothing stood out as fantastic about them. The tempura flakes on one of our rolls were definitely stale.  (unless chewy tempura flakes are the new thing...?) next time I'm in the Queen City, I will skip Room 112. Sorry (as for the filthy wine glass, it was replaced even after the wine was poured in... the bottle was replaced as well)."}
{"text":"I went here a few years ago with some friends from lunch. I can't remember the details of that experience but I remember not hating it, so when I was craving sushi recently and in the area, I got lunch from here to go. I ordered a veggie spring roll and a crunchy roll without cream cheese. The price was decent and the wait wasn't terrible.   I walked across the street to the coffee shop where we were doing some work and then ate my takeout. I say that to say, there wasn't a large gap of time between when I got my food and when I ate it so I feel like I got a good representation of what their food tastes like.   The spring roll was okay - decent size and crispy on the outside. What I didn't love is that the veggies inside were kind of mushy.   The crunch roll was pretty good. I wish the shrimp tempura were more fresh, but it was still good.   Overall, I won't rush back to this place but I wouldn't be opposed to having it again. I think the three and a half star average review is spot on."}
{"text":"Service was quick.  I ordered the house salad and two rolls.  I found the rolls and salad to be quite tasty.  All the fish was cut well and fresh."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I really enjoyed my lunch! I ordered the sesame chicken from the Wok section of the menu and it was delicious.! I look forward to visiting again soon..hopefully it's during the evening so I can experience both atmospheres.   FYI: it's definitely busy during the lunch hour and there are no reservations available. I sat down around 12:30PM and it was a full house."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem while a friend and I were walking around downtown trying to figure out what to have for dinner. This was the best decision we made that evening. Smallish space, but the food is Amazing! Did you notice the capital A? Just checking. Portion sizes are perfect for my friend and I to share. We had 2 apps and two rolls... the cherry blossom and.... something else delicious. But the fried tofu was the smash hit of the evening. If we ever figure out how to do that at home, we're using it to take over the world."}
{"text":"When in-town for for a short while, I quickly pulled up Room 112, trusting the local Yelpers hoping that I could get some good sushi on the fly. I wasn't let down and had a good time.   - Average wait time - Free valet in the front - Located within a hotel - Prices are reasonable  The place was a bit hard to find at first since it's within a hotel and I'm not from the area. It took a while to get seated and service was slow but I arrived last minute during prime-time to grab a bite so it was expected. I left with a $50 bill for two people and for the quality was on-point.  All-in-all I chowed down on five rolls and an order of Sashimi. There were some high and low points with the meal but overall the quality was much higher than I've experienced in the South with Sushi. My wife always plays it safe and her food turned out better because it was more basic so beware. If you like to experiment with new food like I do, you might get something that is lacking.Fancy doesn't mean better.  I ordered a King tuna ($9.95) and Rainbow roll ($8.95) to start. You can;t really go wrong with either because of the amount of fish that's slammed together. The King Tuna had a dabble of sauce on top which was supposed to be all of the flavor you get, but really didn't do much to add to the roll but serve as eye candy.  I followed up with some Smoked salmon sashimi ($4.25) and a Shrimp hand roll ($4.95) which is always a winner as long as the fish is fresh. I would have liked to order some more sashimi since this was so delicious. Fresh salmon just melts on your tongue like butter!  My wife went for the Crunchy Cali roll ($7.95) and Super Crunchy Roll ($9.95) which are common staples in the American sushi restaurant. There is not much to say here other than you're playing it safe and don't expect and explosion of flavor.  When eating at Room 112 you're getting the typical restaurant-in-a-hotel prices in a nice setting with reasonable food and service. If you live in the city or are just dropping by this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"This was recommend by Yelp on our first night in Charlotte. The food was beyond amazing and fresh. We ordered the Teriyaki Chichen (superb) the Upper Manhattan sushi roll and the black pepper steak!!! It was amazing. It is really tiny so call ahead!"}
{"text":"The hamachi (yellowtail) we had here was a very generous portion and absolutely perfect. The sushi chef and kitchen staff know what they are doing here. The ambiance/interior design is kind of dated and it's a little weird to have a spot in a bank, but we liked the food (lunch) a lot. The only sort of unpleasant thing was that one of the staff (bartender?) was hanging around before her shift (I'm guessing) and was very unprofessionally spreading her crap out on the bar as she ate her meal, and then was going back and forth behind the counter, while she complained loudly about something personal. It was intrusive. I worked in restaurants throughout my 20s, so I'm not being prissy about this. It's just bad form. Other than that, it was a pretty good experience and I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and I ordered Singapore noodles with no egg and tofu over the phone and that lady was in so much hurry that she didn't bother to tell me that it has shrimp and chicken. I walked for a mile and picked up the food. To my shock, I found shrimp and chicken after taking a bite. I called them up and informed them of this politely as I felt it was my mistake too that I didn't mention \"No meat\". She said she had to check with her manager on what could be done. After a few minutes, she said if I could go back with this box of noodles, they would replace it. It was 2.40pm and I didn't have a choice other than to go back. I went and after 15 minutes, they gave me the food. I checked and everything looked fine. After I have eaten almost 3/4th of the noodles, I find pieces of chicken still lying there. This worries me a lot as I mentioned to them that I was allergic and yet, gave me the same food after doing some kitchen tricks to remove the meat pieces from the same noodles. Ughh!! What sort of a restaurant will do this to the customers? I don't think I will ever go back."}
{"text":"CHARLOTTE - Really great sushi. Small place with great service. Drink was a bit over poured but I'm not complaining. Nice people. Sat at the bar by myself and chatted with the servers and food preps behind the bar. Easy and quick before dinner rush."}
{"text":"Very good.  We rolled in late and not looking our best - asked if they could seat us, the  main guy didn't look that enthusiastic but he did.  Sushi was good.  Service okay - no napkin and a little slow to take the order ."}
{"text":"Ordered the sesame chicken and it was TERRIBLE and undercooked. I have never felt so sick in my life. It tasted like they barely cooked it then microwaved it real quick. I reccomend eating your own shit before going here"}
{"text":"This is based on a Sushi Lunch pick-up order. I ordered the Sushi Combo B, which includes one maki roll, from a list of about 7 choices, and 4 pieces of nigiri, from a selection as well. I chose the Spicy Salmon Roll with a piece of Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, and White Tuna. For $10.95 this option comes with a ginger house salad, and I added a wonton soup. The sushi was good, especially the Spicy Salmon Roll. And, both the soup and salad were great. What a great sushi spot, for pick-up within 10 minutes."}
{"text":"My first time eating at Room 112 and I absolutely love it. I had the chicken with broccoli and it came with your choice of brown, white or fried rice and a spring roll. I asked them to cook the broccoli tender and they did it perfectly. It was not as greasy as a regular Chinese food place would be which is a plus (I know its an Asian place, ijs lol).   The only thing i didn't care for was the plates. They use very pretty long rectangular plates and your food always falls off the sides. Other than that I highly recommend this place, if you're having a taste for some good Chinese food................opt for Asian ;-)"}
{"text":"Very nice place. The people there are friendly. But the food was just okay. Wasn't bad but nothing that great. Maybe I just order the wrong food. Again the food was on the skimpy end."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were outstanding. The Pink Floyd roll is out of this world, so is the beef negimaki.  My wife and I came in on a VERY busy night and it was our pleasure to have Mayana be our waitress. I cannot say enough about her. First of all, i don't think she's a waitress, but knew how busy the restaurant was and didn't want us to have to wait too long. She went out of her way to make sure our experience was great from beginning to end. I CANNOT STRESS IT ENOUGH. SHE IS INCREDIBLE!   great time, great food, great drinks and atmosphere. check this place out if you haven't."}
{"text":"It was ok. Sushi could've been better. Found a bone in my salmon sashimi. Not a good sign."}
{"text":"One of my few sushi experiences in Charlotte. They have reasonable prices a good variety and decent quality sushi. Most other places I've been here have been super expensive, but the quality didn't seem to suffer here. Have a variety of saki and Japanese beers as well. I'll definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"came in to pick up lunch on a weekday and boy it was packed! i ordered the lunch special to go, along with the volcano salad. the volcano salad was overly disappointing, and although sounded/looked good from yelp - i've had better. i didn't have any crunchy tempura in my salad. only had seaweed at the bottom and a super small ration of kani salad. very disappointing when it costs upwards of $8/$9. the 2 sushi rolls for lunch were decent and satisfied the sushi craving! one thing though is it isn't intuitive when you try to find the location. believe it is inside the suntrust building so you do have to go inside the building to see the restaurant. there was also a separate back entrance from the side street but i didn't know how to get there. had it not been for the salad, i would most definitely have given a higher rating on yelp."}
{"text":"Great sushi so I'm here almost every week.  My favorite is Just Pete.  It's a small place and can get over crowded.  If it looks busy ask about the wait before you order."}
{"text":"This is a secret little spot, small inside but huge on taste! The drinks were well made and the sushi was scrumsious!! They have a side selection of options for you to choose form as well as some new ones I had never heard of before.   Best tip about this place: they have outdoor seating if the weather is good, but otherwise you walk into the golden front of the building and the hallway where there is a single door is on the right with their name on it. It can be a bit tricky to find."}
{"text":"Ah, this was my first visit but it was awesome. I'm not a sushi snob but I've had enough to know the good stuff. Definitely worth your time and money to check it out.  awesome!"}
{"text":"I was not pleased with my meal at all. The salad rolls were obviously premade and refigerated because the rice paper was stiff and cold. The singapore noodles were a bit salty and rushed. Maybe next time I'll try the sushi."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place,my friend suggested we go because she had a groupon for them and she used to eat here on her lunch breaks when she used to work downtown so i said hey why not,,i swear i never knew this placed even existed it's tucked away in a corner. California crunchy sushi roll is what i ordered which was pretty good, we also had the shrimp tempura that neither one of us were crazy about ,cocaine liquid is what we were gassed up on, no worries its a drink,actually a shot which to my suprise both of us really loved!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we have eaten here. We have tried a variety of rolls, sashimi, appetizers and main course entrees. There is nothing that we didn't enjoy, everything was delicious.  One thing that did strike us as strange was that the hostess asked if we had reservations yet both times we were there the restaurant was maybe at half capacity.  Our waiter Jeff was awesome, he was on top of his game, he was very attentive with my daughter even letting her choose her own kid chopsticks.  Our dinner was very enjoyable, food was delicious and ambiance perfect! Also to the couple sitting by the window who paid for our dinner without us knowing...THANK YOU! You left before we knew you paid, so we couldn't personally thank you for the kind gesture of paying entirely for our meal. But we do promise to pay it forward!"}
{"text":"I just do take out from RM112 almost every Saturday night unless we have a conflict with being gone.  Sushi has always been really good and ready to go when I get there to pick it up.  Been to Nikko, K.O.Sushi (good for lunch takeout), Cowfish, Jade, Sushi Guru, and Mushashi but still find this place best in value and quality.  Usual order is the House Sushi Sampler, Unagi, Tamago & Firecracker Roll.  Always been consistent in the quality of the fish."}
{"text":"We have been here 2 times.  The first time was a great experience.  We had a girl that's mong serve us and she was a great server she checked on is constantly and took care of us well.  I forgot her name but she a cute Asian girl server.  The food was really good and we were pleased.   We decided to come again cauze our first visit was great. This time around was a complete 360. Bad service, less calamari then last time in our appetizer and the sauce on the sushi was very little.  We were very disappointed with the service the most. Server was this tall Caucasian male wirh gauges in his ears. We rarely checked on us and we constantly waived the manager down to get us something.  We knew the server want busy become he was right in front of us but behind the sushi bar.  Two other things that was disturbing was that another girl server was playing and braiding her hair where all the sushi was being made...  Restaurant cleanliness was not there today.  She playing with her hair made me conclude that management is not strict with their hygiene policy and managers or owners are just too easy going...  Horrible.   Lastly the ambience was not there.  I literally felt like I was in a clothing store like pacsun or American Eagle cause the rock music they were playing was not right for sushi dinner ambience.."}
{"text":"Best sushi, great for lunch either sit in or takeaway. If you are ordering takeaway call them first to place your order as it takes about 15-20 mins as all made fresh and they are popular.  Service is always great, friendly and fast.  I haven't been for dinner yet, just lunch at least once a week,  but look forward to trying out dinner"}
{"text":"Grabbed takeout from here on my walk home from work. Calling in the order was quick and easy and picking it up went just as smoothly. However, I did waste a little time trying to find the place. I was aware of the side door located on Trade Street by the Polk Park waterfall, but apparently that is not an entrance. Avoid looking like a moron like me and instead enter through 112 Tryon Place.   I ordered the Super Crunchy roll (crab, shrimp tempura, avocado, cream cheese, masago, unagi sauce). It was pretty good but there was nothing to really distinguish it from the countless other sushi places uptown. There could have been more masago, if not only for presentation. On top of that, it was a little pricier than I would've liked. I expected 10 or 12 pieces for $9 but the 8 pieces left me a little hungry."}
{"text":"The best tofu I have ever placed in my mouth. Truly a gem of a restaurant. Superb quality and moderate prices. The atmosphere is simple casual. They offer select wines that pair well with their specialty dishes."}
{"text":"I came to Room 112 with a colleague for drinks and an early dinner. She said she was craving sushi and after doing some Yelp searching, this is where we ended up. All I can say is it was a very good choice. We started with chicken lettuce wraps and finished with four different sushi rolls. All of it was just excellent. Add in that the service was great and the fact that I could actually taste gin in my G&T and just wow!  Best sushi in Uptown?  Hard to imagine that it's not."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  Their sushi is decent.  It is pricy for the amount of food they served.  We ordered 2 rolls of sushi, sashimi sampler, two different kinds of nigiri and we left wanting more.  It took forever for the food to come out too.  Two stars will be my true review of the overall experience, but the food is pretty good so they got three stars."}
