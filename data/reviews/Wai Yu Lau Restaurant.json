{"text":"The place charged us 90 for a fish and their attitude was awful when my friends and I asked why is the name of the fish and its price not on the menu. They claim that it's just temporary and the fish (there was a whole tank of that kind of fish) will be gone by next week, that's why the cost is not on the menu and they even blamed us for not asking the price. They said it's bass but that bass is different than the bass they have on the menu so charged us a much higher amount. What a lousy excuse.  After eating there all 10 of us got food poisoning. I strongly believe it is the famous cold chicken dish that we all ate and the severity of our symptoms directly correlates with how much chicken each person ate that day. I did notice there was some redness between the bones but didn't raise any concern at that time. Obviously we've reported this place to Public health.  Needless to say, I strongly DO NOT RECOMMEND this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISON. ALL FOUR OF US. Apparently there are previous food poisonings from this restaurant, as seen on Toronto Public Health website. I wish I knew about it before going in there so that i didn't have to suffer through a WHOLE WEEK of diarrhea, fever, and nausea. THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU STEP IN HERE."}
{"text":"I would have not giving any star if I could. Worse restaurant ever!! Food was horrible, both my boyfriend and I got food poisoning after dining there. The server's attitude was terrible. We only had two dishes and they charged us $50. I have no idea how can a restaurant like this be still operating. I should have read reviews here before going :("}
{"text":"This place is one of those late night restaurants that closes at 5am.  The pricing is average for the Scarborough area.  I've been here 3 times so far.  I come when most restaurants are closed.  The food is average.  Service is alright.  They serve Cantonese food.  Decor is nothing fancy just normal Chinese restaurant in Scarborough area.  A good place to hit up when I'm hungry in the middle of the night."}
