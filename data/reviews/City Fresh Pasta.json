{"text":"This is my go to lunch (and sometimes breakfast spot) during the work week! While I know their pastas are what they are all about, I love their fresh salads and soups! I have recommended several co-works and visitors to stop by for lunch and everyone always comments on how good the food is. Also, If you are running late in the morning and forget breakfast they have you cover with amazing breakfast sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This place just moved into the building where I work. They were operating out of the lobby for awhile until their storefront opened, so I gave them a couple tries and I have not been let down ever! Their pasta is delicious! I had their truffle Mac and cheese once and I swear, it was the best Mac and cheese I have ever tried. I think it's owned by a husband and wife duo who are always super friendly and seem to be working really hard to serve their customers quality food that tastes really good. Today I had a buffalo chicken salad and their cauliflower and leek soup with pesto - excellent! I'm pretty sure anything you try here is going to be A+! I'm glad they're right here where I work so I don't have to go far for a good meal. Their menu also changes, which I think is really nice because you get to try new things. The only \"issue\" this place has is that they seem to be new and you have to wait a bit for your food, but I think it's because it's only two people working and they're still trying to get their groove. Either way, this deserves a try! (Also some people see the boxes that the pasta or salad come in and think it's small but it's a HUGE portion. They pack a lot into the boxes!)"}
{"text":"I am consistently amazed with the quality of their food. Everything they make is extremely fresh, flavorful, and delicious! From the breakfast sandwiches to pierogi, you really can't go wrong. I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"The place was a little hard to find being from out of town. It's a little hole in the wall and the front showcases the daily specials as well as their different types of pasta. 

I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with black pepper noodles and chicken. My fiance got the meatball marinara and we both added a side of garlic bread. 

There were a few people who ordered in front of us but the wait was not bad. When we got the pasta it was very fresh and full of flavor. The garlic bread was amazing! Don't let the little brown box fool you because the meal was very satisfying."}
{"text":"This is where Yelp! needs to add a sixth star. I LOVE City Fresh Pasta and am sad that it took me this long to visit their location in Nova Place. The menu has expanded since their days in the (old) Pittsburgh Public Market and it made my ordering very difficult! Our group settled on a chicken taco, Cadillac Perogis, and an amazing mozzarella ravioli dish (I forget the actual name of the dish). The flavors that they are able to pull together in the dishes are really top notch. 

I am looking forward to going back for more tacos - they have a pasta shell, rather than a tortilla! The soup list today was so enticing, but I was so excited about pasta I couldn't move away from the dishes we ordered. There was a cauliflower & blue cheese soup that really had my attention, and I'm hoping it is on the menu frequently enough for my next trip!

So clearly the prepared food is amazing. Now, the people - the owner is so friendly and welcoming and the staff is great as well. It was clear that the folks who work in the building have a great rapport from what I saw. They also have items for sale - pasta sauce, uncooked pasta, etc. that brings City Fresh home. I did try that before, but my cooking skills don't compare, so I'll keep asking them to cook it for me!

As I said in my 'tip', this is a place you should go out of your way for. And certainly, if you are in the north side, this should be your go-to for food!"}
{"text":"First time trying their food and it was amazing. I went on Friday because of 5 dollar Friday's I wasn't disappointed. I will be going back but I got the Twin buffalo chicken wraps with gorgonzola and cucumber celery salad 
And my sister got classic Alfredo with shrimp added. The shrimp in the alfredo was a bit salty but she couldn't stop eating because the pasta was so fresh and the Alfredo sauce is to die for. I had no issue with my twin buffalo wrap I let my brother taste it and he loved it too. I would like to buy the gorgonzola and cucumber celery salad by itself I couldn't get enough that was my first time trying it I need a bowl of it seriously. City Fresh Pasta is definitely worth the money and the staff was friendly and the food took less than 10 minutes. I need to try more of their pasta flavors."}
{"text":"I always get the spinach ravioli. This is hands down the best ravioli i have ever had. There for is amazing. Its always fresh and the different ingredients really makes the food feel like its been amazimgly hand crafted. I eat from this restaurant atleast 2 times a month.  Great service and the garlic bread is a must have if u ever go. I highpy reccomend ."}
{"text":"Super fresh and YUM!  They have creative daily specials and $5 Friday deals that are amazing. There a wide variety of pastas and sauces and other combos- including perogies and mac n.cheese. They also have fresh salads and homemade lemonade (strawberry basil is to doe for)and limeade.  Selection changes daily.
Their sauces are delicious and can be on the heavy side.  I'm the three times I've been there, there's been a butter or cream element. Having said that I'm pretty certain that you can go lighter- I'm just not sure how light. 
Worth a stop."}
{"text":"So good! We had training at 4 allegheny and didn't want the bistro again. This pasta place was perfect and hot! I got fresh pasta with chicken and marinara sauce. Very good and I will be back. The guy up front was funny. I enjoyed that."}
{"text":"Used to be ok, par for the Friday price.  Red sauce is ho hum,too chunky, no flavor! Random flavored noodles,  with no correlation to sauce!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan as someone who now works in the Nova Place building.  
City Fresh keeps an ever changing menu and runs specials both for lunch and dinner.  I really like the option of the pasta dinner to-go.
Friendly, prompt service, and good prices rounds out their menu as a place I keep coming back to.
The only thing keeping it from a 5 star is the fact that they often go heavy handed with the oils and rich sauces.  That and their meatballs are a miss.  But, their pasta is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"In what is now Nova Place (former Allegheny Center Mall) tucked away down by PNC Bank and the broken escalator you will wander upon City Fresh Pasta.  Word around town is that they put magic in their homemade sauces and pierogies and it must be true because I keep coming back for their Cadillac Pierogie without the bacon and it's such a lot of good food for me that I want to finish it but I can't. These pierogies deserve to be eaten. It's topped with gorgonzola cheese and spinach leaves and tomato. There's hints of basil on here and just as magical as promised. It doesn't hurt that every time I visit the people behind the counter are always just so pleasant. I wish I could buy everything. One day I shall wander in and try buying their fresh pasta to make at home and then I can be the chef! You must give this place a go."}
{"text":"Being a pasta conissueour, this little gem tucked away in Allegheny Center Mall has the freshest, most delicious pasta I've had in ages. Super dope chicken parmesan, served over perfectly done al-dente fettuicine was cooked to perfection. The fluffy, airy, toasted G Bread was amazing and you get 4 small pieces for a dollar. They have a ton of variety, and their vast selection of frozen ravioli is absolutely divine. If I ever have to walk death row, my last meal will surely be from City Fresh Pasta. Tales will be told of this legendary monument. 

I see pesto of green, red sauce too, I see them boil pasta for me and you, and I think to myself, what a wonderful meal.
- To the tune of Louie Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\""}
{"text":"City Fresh Pasta is the hidden gem of Allegheny Center. Their pasta is consistently good, the menu is always changing so you never get bored, and the employees are extraordinarily nice. 
I brought a friend today and asked her if it lived up to the hype, and she definitely thought it did. She said it was the best buffalo Mac and cheese that she'd ever had anywhere. 
Today I got spaghetti and meatballs with spicy ramano sauce. It was delicious. The sauce was similar to alfredo but a bit lighter and definitely delicious. 10/10"}
