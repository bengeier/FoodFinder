{"text":"Wonderful spot to get a take-out sub or sandwich at the far end of Carrick.The corned beef is especially good - not too fatty, good flavor and shaved thin. They also have fries and chicken and some other items. Food is made fresh and however you like it. It is also a convenience store. Very friendly helpful service. They are good neighbors. They keep the place clean and well-lit at night."}
{"text":"I finally found a place that is not afraid to put meat on their sandwiches!  I had the New Yorker and it looked like something you would get in New York City.  The side salad was also huge.  I ordered through UberEATS and received everything delivered to my front door in under 30 min."}
{"text":"I love corn beef sandwiches but the sandwich I received a hanini's market I brought home and could not eat. It was fatty and tasted almost rancid. I thought it was just me so I put it down for my dog to eat but after just a few sniffs he wouldn't touch it either.  I continued to frequent Hanini's Market even after the sandwich incident for non-food related items however now they have let their best employees go and the only people left working there make you feel uncomfortable as you walk around the store shopping.  I don't think I'll be returning."}
