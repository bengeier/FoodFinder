{"text":"The lady's were very nice behind the bar!  I know it's called gambling. But I have never won a dime from them. I have played plenty of times to get a little something back. But oh well. Boring inside but nice service."}
{"text":"Great Place!!! Don't forget to experience \"Angry Balls\" while you are visiting.   1.5oz Fireball whiskey, fill with Angry Orchard, serve over ice."}
{"text":"BEST PLACE IN TOWN. Excellent food. Excellent drinks. Beyond excellent service. Everyone working there has such a great attitude, especially my server Karen. She was quick, attentive, and made me feel like family. I highly recommend this location and will be back many many times. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This may be the only 5 star review I'll ever give for a chain (BUT it is a local chain, privately owned). Putters is an awesome unassuming local bar with great people and surprisingly good food. I say \"surprising\" because good bar grub seems to be hard to find around the area, particularly in a segment that include PTs and Village Pub. Casey - the manager - is extremely friendly and takes great care of this establishment.  My only gripe - and it's one that I would share with PTs and Village Pub, to be fair - is that the tap selection needs some diversification AND there's a great opportunity for this location in particular. Granted any promotional runs during football season requie concessions to likes of Bud, but there's still an opportunity here. Right now, Hi Scores is the only outfit rolling in this area with a good selection of craft beers. The problem is they're often way too pricey.   Overall, good food, wonderful people, proper prices, and low key atmosphere make this a great find for our area."}
{"text":"I love this \"bar-food\".  The service is great. Teri was our server,  she's funny and knows the menu like she wrote it herself.  The food arrived quickly,  hot & delicious and with a smile.  Mom loved it too.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I can't go Sundays to watch the games.   But during the week,  especially for lunch I'll be going  back."}
{"text":"This place is a dump food is terrible bartenders are sub par are server was old and slow she was rude coudnt even grt a refill !! never going back !!!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been! It's a must! All of the food seems to be home made (chips, soups etc) We had the nachos and the frisco burger. We told the server Karen that we would split it, she took the time to split the meal in half and bring us our meal on individual plates! Food was excellent and Karen really made our experience memorable. We are looking forward to come back."}
{"text":"Great bar,not smokey at all. Food was awesome. Our server Karen is the best. Very attentive and friendly. We'll be coming back weekly!!"}
{"text":"I met up with some friends at this bar not long now and it's safe to say I would recommend this place to anyone. The bartenders and staff are very friendly plus the pizza is out of this world. It was a very good first experience there and will be sure to come back soon."}
{"text":"As per usual this place is the best! From server Teri, chef Luis, bartenders Jill and Megan, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Putters resembles many bar & grill gaming restaurants. Since it was convenient for us, we stopped in for lunch.  Pool tables and comfy chairs to the right, high top tables in the middle and the bar area to the left is what you are greeted with.  But I don't want to leave out our waitress and bartender who also greeted us immediately upon entering.    Teri is an awesome waitress.  She is so friendly and made us feel welcome. She checked on is quite frequently even during their busy lunch time. I was happy with our great service.    I was in the mood for a burger. I skimmed the menu to see the Frisco sandwich.  A burger with Swiss, thousand island, lettuce , tomato and onion on grilled sourdough bread. They offer other options for burgers but I love sourdough.  It didn't disappoint! Delicious... A bit on the greasy side but worth it.  I would absolutely order this again.    I enjoyed a very satisfying lunch.  Thanks Putters!"}
{"text":"Hey, wanna have a good time? Go see Tony on graveyard, especially if you like to talk about sports!"}
{"text":"I lived in Vegas for 4 years and never had visited this location or any I recently moved back to LA. When I in town its a nice spot for a couple of drinks with the ex co workers"}
{"text":"Came in to Putters for lunch today and had a very pleasant experience. The building had a modern design and the interior was very clean and modern as well, with high ceilings and open space. The real gem of this place is the bartender Michael. He was very kind, courteous and professional which made our time here more enjoyable. I had an amazing grilled cheese sandwich appropriately called \"The Big Cheese\". 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I was traveling alone and wasn't in the mood to hit the strip. It was a Thursday night so I decided to try Putter's to watch Thursday night football. It was a good choice. It has a big bar area, with TVs and lots of tables on all sides. Be warned that this is a smoking bar. It's a big place and wasn't very full so it wasn't too bad, though I could definitely sense the smoke in the air. I'd say you should avoid Putter's if you're really sensitive to smoke.  The beer selection is not huge but they do have one IPA, Goose Island, which is always a good choice. They have a good happy hour, with sliders and lots of apps, generally about $2 off the regular price.  I ordered the Southwestern Chicken Sliders - 3 good sized mini-burgers with grilled onions, peppers and cheese. They were excellent. The chicken was perfectly grilled and not over cooked. They aren't particular spicy but have a nice flavor.  My waitress, Karen, was great, very friendly and attentive. The smoking notwithstanding, Putter's is a good bar to catch a football game, drink a beer and eat some good food."}
{"text":"This is a large bar with the pool table and plenty of off bar seating and the food is good and the drinks are cold."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the first time because I had heard great things about it! I must say, I will definitely be going back and this will be my new hang out spot! Awesome happy hour specials and love that happy hour starts at 10pm, where as most places happy hour starts much later. The bartender Paul was on top of his game and very friendly. If I could give this place 10 stars, I definitely would! Very impressed."}
{"text":"We live at wigwam and maleena mesa and have drove by this place numerous times. After a night of bowling I called the bar to see if they had golden tee. Hector said they did so we finally popped in. I'm a graveyard bartender as well at sammys woodfire pizza recently transferred to the Green valley location. My wife and I were looking for a local spot to hang and watch our teams for football and Hector told that they have the package as well. With that said we were more pleased with the atmosphere and service we received and will become regulars there from now on. Thank you Hector for being great, and we also met a few regs Dave and his wife Rita, and also Chris. All in all great experience and we will definitely make this our regular bar from now on. Thanks again."}
{"text":"Located down the street from the DMV in a spot that was originally the Hot Rod Grill many years ago.  Stopped in for breakfast yesterday morning. Bartender took our order and provided good service the entire time.  Plenty of tables to sit at, most high top but some low tables with lounge type chairs. Food was excellent and reasonably priced.  Tried the bar top poker machine after eating and didn't lose too much $$. Got to play a while on $20. Will be back."}
{"text":"What would we ever do without Putters!?!? Absolutely our favorite bar ever!! Great staff and food"}
{"text":"Best bar in town! Louie, the grave yard cook made us the best guacamole!! It was out of this world! It's not even on the menu, but we mentioned that we were in the mood for some and he whipped it up for us in no time, we will definitely be back for the great food that Louie makes and the excellent service from Steve and hector at the bar."}
{"text":"Started off with a nice cold Stella draft. Hubs ordered a spicy Bloody Mary , said it was pretty good, and his Bud light was nice and cold. Smoking establishment, not my favorite but it is a bar so ....... Pre-season football on TV so that's a plus. I ordered the whaler sandwich with fries and hubs ordered ground beef tacos. My sandwich was good, nothing spectacular. Hubs said his tacos were good but would have been better if they were fried.  Overall for my first time here it was good. Next time I think I'd like to try breakfast"}
{"text":"Food is great, the staff are very friendly with great service love it here , it's kept very clean I recommend a visit here"}
{"text":"Staff is over the top nice. Always friendly no matter who is working. Food is amazing, good machines, nice pool table, plenty of seating. A+ staff Spencer, Megan, Michael, and the rest!"}
{"text":"I love that the eating area is so far from the bar. It's quiet, and you can't smell the liquor and I love the chairs! They are so cozy. There was no server but you would never know because Spencer the bartender gave us good service while he tended bar at the same time. Food was really good. Buffalo chicken sliders were excellent. Dinner Salad was really fresh, good and big. I pass this place every day on the way home from work I will definitely be getting some to go food in the future."}
{"text":"Pretty great little spot tucked away on American pacific. When I moved last year to a new area of Hendo, I hoped on yelparoo to see what the local grub situation spot and behold this peaked my interest. I almost didn't venture here due to the fact that there is smoking inside. I have asthma so once the smoke level reaches a certain point i just can't do it. I was pleasantly surprised when I visited the smoke was not an issue. My waitress was really kind, I opted for a sandwich and some fries. The sandwich was pretty good and the fries were really good. The spot is great due to it's ridiculous closeness to me and happy hour specials."}
{"text":"An awesome bar we found across the street. Awesome food, bartenders and atmosphere! If your looking for a place to enjoy some good food and drinks, you should definitely stop by this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here.  First time had the Cuban sliders and the smokehouse sliders. The smokehouse sliders were great. The Cuban sliders was just a sub type sandwich cut into thirds. And overall not very tasty.  This time I had the nachos. For a big guy like me, they were pretty fulfilling.  We sat at the bar to play the video gambling thinking they would comp drafts like every other bar in Vegas.  Nope. They will comp 1 drink per $20 buy in. What is that about? I have never been to a bar where they don't comp drinks. Ok, maybe I have found one bar that said they will comp drinks after $20 buy in, but NEVER $20 buy in PER DRINK!!!  The mediocrity of the food and ridiculous comp \"rules\" means I won't be coming back. In Begas there are too many places to go that value their customers."}
{"text":"Never ever in Vegas have I paid for beers while gambling. $20 buy in per beer is B. S. The wings were horrible, the only thing this place has going for it is Spencer the bartender! Otherwise it plain stinks. You will never have my patronage again."}
{"text":"Great food. I love their wraps especially the buffalo chicken wrap. The downside on why it did not get 5 stars is the fact that they charge for takeout. I live across the street and would rather eat their delicious food at home."}
{"text":"Hmmmm.  Great server but the food was not good.We had the patty melt and a Cobb salad. Sorry. I cannot recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Love coming here!  I would have to try to complain about anything something here and even then I think I would fail."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I Just moved around the corner and thought we would try this place out... for a small appetizer waited 35 min, brought out my mac and cheese first which was a lot bigger compared to the spinach dip, then my spinach dip was cold!!pizza & chicken sandwich was good. And once my food was there didn't even ask if I needed something to drink terrible terrible service and I've been industry for 9 years. So disappointing. Never again."}
{"text":"Started playing pool with a pool league here and I can honestly say I am quite happy with the place. Service is excellent. Karen does an amazing job of making sure we always have what we need and the food is delicious. I try something different each time I come and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Wooo 24/7 bar and food in the quiet Henderson neighborhood.   Putters is cleaner and fresher than most all night bars. Their kitchen is open until 3 am everyday (maybe 24/7 on weekends but I'm not sure).   Bar is standard.   Food was good quality bar food, we waited a reasonable amount of time, and the service was good!"}
{"text":"Never thought I'd have such a great time waiting for my windshield to get fixed.  Wife had been here before and she was hip to that $5 cheeseburger and fries deal. We got in and definitely appreciated how cool and dark it was compared to the heat outside. They had plenty of college football games on, and they picked a good one for the main audio.  Bartender was very nice and introduced herself and got our names. She changed to a specific game for me when I asked, which is not always a given in places. Octoberfest on draft was hitting the spot something nice. Got our food order in pretty quick too.  FIVE DOLLAR CHEESEBURGER AND FRIES.   That's what you get when you're here. The Burger was amazing.No fanciness, no bacon jam or chipotle aioli. Just a cheeseburger with fries. The food is as amazing as the order is straightforward."}
{"text":"I swear, the other 5 star reviews are not lying! Our bartender was Spencer, and he was SUPER friendly.  We had the Cuban sliders and the Southwest chicken sliders. Needless to say, they were amazing!  Overall, a 10 star experience as far as quality and service. Spence is a beast!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of putters for a few years. Now I'm so excited there is one closer to my new house. The service was excellent, food was great, great bartenders!! Awesome machines!"}
{"text":"I have been here on two occasions--one time while waiting to get my windshield fixed and the other during an all night softball tournament.   Both times, I have been very impressed. Both times, I ordered that awesome $5 cheeseburger deal. It's a really great deal to soak up some alcohol. I am always happy when a place asks how you want your burger cooked and has several cheese options, especially on a \"cheap\" burger deal.  The place has tons of tv's to get your sport-watching on. Is pretty roomy with space to sit at the bar or some chill couches. Also, the bathrooms are pretty clean.   But on top of all that, I have always had top-notch service. Extremely nice and welcoming bar-tending staff. Quick to ask you name, take orders, refill your drinks, etc. If in the neighborhood, a recommended place."}
{"text":"Love this place, I always receive friendly service and warm welcome from the staff. The food is also good and they make a mean drink"}
{"text":"This is a tough one because we loved the location, area, cleanliness, layout, etc.  but a cardinal sin of any bar that dare call itself \"sports\" is to have the basic NFL and College Sports TV packages. Before we could even unpack and starting drinkin' and eatin' they said we could not get an NFL game. They had the NFL NBC game and said they could not change any of the many great TV's to FOX network (when we said Fox is a broadcast channel, the bartender said they did not get that either). Friendly about it and wish it would have worked out. If you want to enjoy televised sports - keep looking.  Should have guessed when there were 2 guys at the bar when we walked in at 11a on Sunday."}
{"text":"Went to putters the other night and and sat in the bar we had excellent service and very good finger foods"}
{"text":"Lisa and spence are the ish ... Cool people great time , machines let vid play all in all great night and we will be back !"}
{"text":"Very Impressed with Putters.  We stopped in on a Friday afternoon for an early dinner.  Bar is nice and clean, with a very nice decor, feels very comfortable. Staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming.    Food was amazing.  Spinach dip wasn't as fancy as some place try to make it, however the flavor of it was spot on.  We also tried the Frisco Burger and it too was amazing.  We deffinetly want to come back and try some of the specials that sounded great.  Beer selection is OK...standard selection of draft beer with one local, and the rest all large format.  Beer was cold. And the IPA I had seemed fresh.    The only little weird thing is that the bar, and food are separate.  When we went to close our tab they brought us two different checks.  Our server (who did great) was able to combine them so there was only one charge, however it seemed a little weird.  4 star review for now until I can see about consistency."}
{"text":"Great service from a great bartender who offered a cherry bomb as a shot I was feeling a little bit tired from allergies and she actually livened me up .I love the atmosphere and she was great!"}
{"text":"Good service and good atmosphere! I went in for lunch and had the burger.  It was cooked to order and very good. The bartender was friendly and competent as well."}
{"text":"Didn't realize my first post here didn't post. Absolutely loved Taco Tuesday. The $4.99 chicken tacos were really good. Service was impeccable. The decor is really nice. Not too busy on a Tuesday evening. I would give 5 stars but no place is perfect. Because it's a casino, it allows smoking. And the only short tables are too short. Happy hour is 3pm to 6pm and 10pm to 2am.  We will be back. Thank you Karen you were a great waitress."}
{"text":"Great locals bar that's NOT SMOKEY! We come here a few times a month for the 10pm happy hour! Happy hour menu offers both drinks and real food - not just appetizers. You can get a cheeseburger and fries for $5! Bar has plenty of seating and has never been overcrowded during the times we came in. Side room had a billiard table if you want to shoot some pool. Jukebox music is always playing. I love this place!"}
{"text":"So I came back after being away for some time Under New Management and I spoke with the manager and one of the waitresses there about introducing a dry rub chicken to the menu they said I be a great idea they took my order. 30 minutes later bartender asked me if I wanted to order food I told him and I already order chicken wings and they only normally take 12 to 15 minutes I was then told my order was never put in and that left a very bitter taste in my mouth considering I had just got off work and I was looking for a quick dinner very question about returning at this point!"}
{"text":"Warning to smoke allergy sufferers, this bar smells like old school vegas even before you walk in. That said, the area by the pool table is less smoky and you can hardly notice the  scent.  The food is better than expected from a bar located in the middle of a deserted street on American Pacific.    I had the cheeseburger and it was cooked to medium the way I like it.  I was glad it came with the toppings on the side so you could choose what was on your burger.  We also shared the Tee off combo appetizer which included potato skins, chicken strips, mozzerella sticks and wings which was ok but not spectacular.  The breading had a slight aftertaste and was a bit on the starchy thick side.  The pool table was open for us on a Saturday and, although the ball return was sticky it made for a fun night.  The staff was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"This is a great, hidden, neighborhood gem locate a bit off of the beaten path. You might miss it if you weren't looking for it.  The service is great - Jeannie is awesome! She is friendly and takes care of her customers. I haven't tried the food yet, but definitely will go back to do so. The machines actually pay out! I seriously saw them pay out like 15 jackpots in the short time I was there.   Their beer choices could use some work. It's seriously time that local bars like this start supporting local breweries! Joseph James Brewing is right around the corner from here and 3 other breweries are within 10 minutes - enough with all of the macro beer crap! People will drink local if you put it on, I promise!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and great customer service! I always make it a point to see Hector and Karen at 10pm and beyond! I bring my Mom here as well, it's great for all ages and I must say Spencer, Meghan and the rest of the crew are awesome! If you like the feeling of Cheer's this is the place!   Good times and Good vibes!"}
