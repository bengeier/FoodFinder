{"text":"We frequent here OFTEN!!   By far the best Indian food found in the GTA. The food perfection!! Great customer service every single time (Ravi is so sweet) and the prices can't be beat!   Highly recommended. If I could, I'd rate 10 stars."}
{"text":"Tried a number of rotis from here which were all great. Samosas are delicious as well. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to roti palace for takeout lunch and ordered Aloo Papri Chat, Chili Goby, Saag Paneer roti and Channa curry with rice..  I really enjoyed to Saag Paneer, as I have never tried it in roti form. I would recommend that. I also really enjoyed the chili goby (breaded, fried cauliflower in spicy chili sauce).  However, I didn't love the Channa, as I usually do. The Chana and rice were pre mixed together.. and because of this, the rice absorbed all the sauce it came with. You should have the rice seperate of the Chana!  I don't understand what the papri chat was, I don't think the dish made sense and it didn't taste good to me. I would not order this again.  Overall, I would come back. But I would not order the papri chat or the Chana with rice (unless I got them seperated)."}
{"text":"I'm rating this place for what it is - a great place for take out or a quick lunch. The flavors are perfect, food is fresh and they appear to use quality ingredients. The prices are reasonable and they have a great lunch special for less than $10 with a samosa and pop and curry in roti of the day.  As a dine in spot, the inside isn't glamorous and i watched a bug cross the floor but the food won me over so I'm still giving it a 5."}
{"text":"This is a kind of flavour I missed since my stint in the Middle East, just ordered a plate of Chicken Biryani which I found authentic. The naan bread is extra order."}
{"text":"Ymmmm....Just finished a curry lamb roti.  The best....tender and nicely spices. We also ordered a side of vegetable pakoras....should have placed a order for two....they are that good. Nice friendly staff.  Will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Roti Palace of India has arrived to provide this neighbourhood with some much needed variety. The menu is filled with Indian delicacies in either roti form or served on rice. Every main on the menu is between $8.50 (vegetarian items) to $12.99 (shrimp filled items), with the chicken items right in the middle in the $10-$12 range.  I had the Chicken Curry Roti as I typically use this as the baseline of roti comparisons.  The roti was a good size, and pretty good tasting. Admittedly the curry itself wasn't my favourite Indian curry but once I added hot sauce it was getting closer to my cup of tea (errrr... box of roti?). The Saag Paneer Roti and the Butter Chicken on rice received higher acclaim than my curry roti, for what it's worth.  Sidenotes: -LLBO for those looking to imbibe with their meal -Cash & Debit only"}
{"text":"New place, been here twice . Both times I was impressed with the food. Reasonably priced, good friendly service. Roti with most dishes was excellent. Had lamb paneer that was very tasty, Curry Chickpeas were also excellent. Warning- Takes no credit cards, so have cash or debit card on hand. However this helps to keep prices down, which is a good thing!"}
{"text":"We ordered a veggie samosa, vegetable korma roti and butter chicken roti as tajeout. Although some people think that when a restaurant asks for your spice level it makes it less good, I tend to prefer this option as you can spice your food to your liking.  The samosa was good and came with sauce. We even got an extra samosa with our order. The rotis were a little less full than we are used to but we were still full after the meal. The restaurant also included some complimentary rice pudding.  I would love to see some dinner specials from this place like appetizer, roti, desert to make me a regular."}
{"text":"We ordered Butter Chicken with rice and Dal roti. The overview, I would say it is worth to go and go back again. The butter chicken is so good , while the dal is not the thing I thought it should be . I might remember the wrong name for what I wanted to eat... sad that they dont have naan bread in the restaurant at all, though we asked to separate roti and we ate it instead of naan bread.. a great place to try around this area"}
{"text":"I love Roti Palace. I usually take out but I have eaten in several times as well. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Everything I've had has been delicious. When you eat in they'll bring you some of their homemade goat milk  yogurt which is delicious. Portions are generous. Love their rice pudding which is rich in delicious Indian spices like cardamon."}
{"text":"Frequently eat out in this area, came here with 2 other co workers. I ordered the Lamb Vindaloo Roti, they asked how spicy do I want it.  This was a red flag as I have yet to be asked if I wanted my vindaloo spicy in any Indian restaurant.  That's like asking \"Do you want your Armageddon Suicide Wings to be mild or spicy?\"  I asked for medium to see what I would get.  My co worker also asked for lamb curry but she wanted it super super spicy.  So it turns out mine was way spicier than hers.    The taste of the roti was not bad but the lamb was dry and wished that it came in bigger chunks of lamb.  Expensive for meat curry in a wrap, $13 before anything.  Service was fine and they seemed friendly.  Pakora was really good, came with sauces, reasonably priced.  Samosa...kind of small and not really authentic, Samosa's here would be the eggroll equivalent.  This place just opened so I'm gonna say these may be just kinks they need to work out.  I was also told there would be a lunch special menu coming soon."}
