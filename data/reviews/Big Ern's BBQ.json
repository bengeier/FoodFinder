{"text":"Whew! The ribs fall off the bone and the chicken is perfect. Great service and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Third stop on our mini food tour of the Container Park.  My wife and I split a pulled pork sandwich, which was surprisingly bland.  Not bad, by any means, just blander than I would normally expect for BBQ.  In retrospect, I should have slathered on some extra BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Food is dry and bland. Service is great. Prices are great. Clean. Good location in Container Park."}
{"text":"I work downtown and was starving and coworker recommended I try out the bbq spot... Strolled on over and I was pleasantly surprised it was pretty good. I only got the rib tips and Mac and cheese (which the cashier recommended) but I was fairly impressed. I did only give the 4 stars because I didn't try more items to give a over all review and although the rib tips were tasty it failed to have that crisp charbroil crunch that you'd expect. But I'd try again for sure especially since it's located in a great location of container park."}
{"text":"I come here once a week for the brisket sandwich and coleslaw.The best BBQ I've been able to find in town. Everyone is super nice and answers all my questions.. And trust me, I ask ALOT! I've also tried the ribs, pulled pork sandwich and hot links. Everything is always so juicy and flavorful. I always leave happy and full. Recently I tried the banana pudding. I definitely was happy with that choice lol! I don't understand how this place could have anything but 5 stars, some people just aren't fortunate enough to know good BBQ!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ EVER!!!  Delicious & generous portions pulled pork. Great added spice to fries!"}
{"text":"Brisket was very fatty and salty.  Wanted macaroni and cheese but they were out of it. Would not be available for an hour. My husband had the same sandwich and it was not fatty. Pork sandwich also did my have a lot of fat.   Have eaten here before. Better last time."}
{"text":"Big Ern's is the best.  When we eat at the container park, we order the brisket only (no sides) and it is the best.  Both Bbq sauces are great but the spicy bbq is our favorite.   After two meals here we had Big Ern cater our neighborhood picnic. 

We had pork, chicken and brisket.  The food was a huge hit, and the brisket was the favorite.  Ernie and his wife delivered the food themselves.

Can't wait to have them cater our next meal.  We will be sure to eat here when we are at the container park."}
{"text":"Let's be fair a BBQ in Vegas in a mall. All things considered it was good. I had the 2 meet dinner chicken and brisket. The chicken was okay but the brisket was very good.  They put some sauce on which I would prefer they not do. I like to add my own.  One last thing they stay open but at 9pm kids have to leave"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Big Ern's got the brisket which was fork tender. Also got the best sweet potato fries the best I've ever had. Portions were large, and served quickly. If you crave Bar B Q, it's worth the trip in downtown."}
{"text":"Best unexpected surprise in container park downtown Las Vegas. Have to be sure to go see Big Ern every chance I get! One of the best bbq joints I have been to"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I'm not a huge bbq fan, but we had guests in town and decided to try it. Everyone really liked it , and their sweet tea was really good! My kids even ate their food. We love the container park, and it's nice that they have good places to eat there!"}
{"text":"We ordered the beef brisket bbq and it was awful! It was not sliced beef but left over mush and fats with sauce to cover!  Never try again! This suck, what a waste of money, the beer was good"}
{"text":"wow! this place rocks! i went there with a friend after a motorcycle ride, so it was a bit late. 10:00pm or so. we both got hotlinks, and i got a side of brisket as well. this is the best BBQ i have had in vegas hands down. i will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a local so certainly not a regular, but me and my group loved this place. Got the brisket sandwich and potato salad. My group also got the pulled pork sandwich, one of their salads, and a meat platter, so we definitely saw what this place has to offer. Everything was really good, and love hanging out at Container Park."}
{"text":"I was walking through container park around 7:30 pm looking for something to eat and was drawn in by their \"best BBQ in Vegas\" sign out front. I look over the menu and order the brisket and rib platter, to find out they were out of everything except pulled pork - including potatoes and even ice. But I understand that sometimes BBQ places run out of meat - you can't simply make more of something that takes 12+ hours to cook if you had a busier than expected day. The cashier and cook were friendly and I ordered my sandwich.

It was supposed to be slow-smoked, but it tasted like... nothing - as if a pork butt was boiled for hours in plain water then pulled. There wasn't even any bark or spices to give any kind of flavor. It seemed like it was cooked too long so the texture was getting a little mushy. The BBQ sauce was good but nothing special. They used a high quality bun and had pretty good beer prices. It wasn't terrible, it just tasted like bbq sauce on a bun. I finished it and then went somewhere else as I was still hungry without a side option.

I don't know if they just had an off day, but the meal I had definitely wasn't worth going back for.  I hope they figure it out because it's a great location with a lot of potential and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Fist off, as you walk into the container park, the smell of this BBQ joint grabs your nose and pulls you towards the container on the right hand side.  You walk up the few steps and open the door, and you feel just like at home.  Super polite staff, and an awesome home made menu is hanging there for you to drool over.  Under the menu, you can see the cooks chop, dice, and make up the plates for their hungry fans.  You decide and order your meal, tell them your name, grab your drinks, and sit down and listen to the radio, chatter of the staff and customers, and take in all of the sights of the neat decor.  They call you name, and you pick up your hot bbq.  You return to your table, and your family looks at you like you like you're a magnificent hunter with a feast set for a king!  You sit back and just admire your new collection of smoked meats and sides, and try to decide which one to eat first.  Usually I go for the hot links to put some spice on my tongue, just to wash it down with a fresh draft beer.   Once the seal is broken, you just go in.  Your family gets real quiet, and everyone is just stuffing their face, and enjoying everything on their plate.  nobody has finished their meal, but now the family has strayed to other member's dishes to try a bite of something else, to see what they want for the next time.  Some how, everyone has room for the banana pudding, and they always finish it.  You grab some foil, and some lids, and haul your leftovers out of the place with a feeling of warmth that is surging though your veins as you know, you get to enjoy them later that day or tomorrow's lunch.  Thank you Ern for the wonderful experience of the joy of good, real BBQ.  I will be back....several times."}
{"text":"Amazing pulled pork sandwich with spicy BBQ sauce. Yummers! Enjoying every bite. Container park on the weekend is for sure still a good time!"}
{"text":"The tall blonde is rude and is very unprofessional. The help is unorganized many people were complaining. The sweet tea tastes like dishwater. Won't be back... don't waste your money."}
{"text":"The best beef brisket in the valley! So good i had to whip out my phone and write a review! Super soft and moist and full of seasoning. Such big flavor, it's def worth the money"}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of bbq to separate the good and the worst and Big Erns is definitely in the bottom of the list. 
Before i do the cons I'll tell you the pros on my visit. 
I just enjoyed the Brisket.. 
Cons...
First and foremost, let's review the ribs... they were not moist and very chewy. There was only 4 pcs and I gave up on the 3rd one. A BBQ joint should always have good ribs.
Second the pulled pork. That pork was so dry and chewy also; even L&L hawaiian bbq does a better job at it even at late hours!. The sauce is not evenly spread out. 
A BBQ joint should have a good sauce and yes the sauce was good considering they only had one flavor that's comparable to the ones I buy at albertsons. 
Next I had the pork and beans...i don't know why the people next to me was saying it's good when it clearly taste like the ones I use to buy at walmart. No special taste there. To be honest I use to buy it as dog food. 
Also did the Potato salad....that was horrible even my kid pointed out it was bad. I also had him try the cup of water telling him it's refreshing. He's reaction?? x[ like that. lol and last the dinner roll. Smh.. 

For the price I'd recommend going to Famous Daves. They have a variety of sauces and the quality is always consistent.  I don't know if I went to Big Erns late but 5 pm there was still lots of people so there shouldn't be an excuse to serve it like that. 
Also people should not always believe on over hyped places. Don't believe it till you try it cause most often it mind f***s u and u start to believe it's good. Believe in your taste buds ;)"}
{"text":"Not great and definitely nothing special. Husband's brisket was mostly fat and the mac and cheese looked and tasted like noodles w butter on them. My pulled pork sandwich barely had any meat and the little it did have also had a lot of fat on it. Several people who ordered after us got their food first and this probably would have continued to go on had we not asked where our food was. Overpriced and blah. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Small place, short walk from Fremont Street but pretty good BBQ here. Look for the giant praying mantis and head into Container Park. Had me some tasty brisket & pulled pork w/an ice cold beer when I was in town recently. Maybe a bit pricey but it was good stuff!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge BBQ fan! Love the location, but the brisket was literally, all fat... Couldn't even eat it..."}
{"text":"The ribs were soooooo freaking good! So good I crave it. Meat fell off the bone -ugh it was sooo good!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is flavor-able without being too salty. The sides are homemade which makes them tasty, not like store-bought or out of a can and heated. The meats are smoked daily.
It's interesting how many people do not understand the difference between wet and dry bbq. Barbecue preference is largely dictated by whether you like saucy or seasoned meat  Dry barbecue is smoked, while the wet variety is usually cooked in a fire pit. 
As they say, the secret is in the sauce. Or the rub. And Big Ern uses both which are also homemade. Rubs are typically worked into the meat the night before it's cooked so that the salt can penetrate the cut and tenderize it. But rubs do more than flavor and soften the meat; they also enhance its texture by caramelizing and forming a crispy crust when cooked. Because of the rub's ability to penetrate the meat, fatty cuts like brisket respond well to this type of seasoning. Memphis BBQ is typically a dry barbecue with sauce on the side; in Kansas City and North Carolina, people like their barbecue wet with even more sauce on the side. 

The service is great, and I have been lucky to sit inside on all my visits, because of the temperatures, but, I am sure that the heaters would be turned on, if needed.

The price to some may be steep, however, go to any fast food restaurant and up-size that meal, and see what you'll pay for heart-attack in a box.
I only have one negative remark and it's to Lonely D who reviewed on 12/23, I understand that the holidays may be lonely for some, but one who is unemployed, was a 3 meat combo really necessary, if you couldn't really afford it?

Ok, another remark to Lonely D. Sorry. French fries, really? i just googled Southern BBQ side dishes and the most common sides are available at Big Ern's. Only one out of 10 sites even listed \"oven-fried\" fries, as a side dish. So I guess, the next time you want to take a \"suicidal\" trip, try McDonald's, i hear they have a form of \"rib\" sandwich (now this is not meant for human consumption).

Big Ern's BBQ is small (meaning a one store location), but a HUGE success!!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent and layout is really cool, it's in an old shipping container. Not a lot of indoor space but good outside space. Ribs were amazing!"}
{"text":"Meh. Got a brisket sandwich that was dry, had a stale bun and very little flavor. Sauce is available to put on yourself, but why not just ask the customer and do it for them? It wasn't horrible, just nothing special. There are plenty of other bbq joints that are spectacular in Las Vegas, just none downtown that I know of."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and fantastic price! Anyone on Fremont needs to check out Container Park and stop here to try the bbq."}
{"text":"In the land of glitzy casinos and big menu prices, Big Erns is a down to earth place with excellent food and an owner that wants to see happy customers. I'm not a BBQ expert but I know good food when I taste it. What Big Erns lacks in over the top atmosphere it more that makes up for in flavor. I had the brisket with two ribs and a baked potato along with BBQ baked beans. The food looked great and tasted even better. The sauce was perfect...I could certainly taste the vinegar but it wasn't overly sweet. And the BBQ baked beans... So good they should be illegal. Big Ern was in the store will I was there and was very friendly to all his customers. If you're in Vegas go to a Big Erns right now!"}
{"text":"I have been here the last 2 times I've been to Vegas and I went back this last time because the BBQ was good the first time j visited but this time something happened in the 5 months from the first visit. The roll that comes with the combo was sooooo dry that it was not edible. My husband literally spit it out. The ribs were tough nothing about falling off the bone here it's more like hold on to the meat with your teeth and pull hard just to get it off. The only good thing is the hot links because the brisket is chewy too. 
In other words if you want good BBQ don't come here."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The brisket was over salted and the Mac and cheese wasn't anything that stands out in a crowd. I'm sure they have their good days and maybe I just came on a day where they were off."}
{"text":"Buyer beware. The employees here are rude, disrespectful and may steal your money by \"accidentally\" giving you the wrong change and refusing to correct it.

Besides that, the food quality is okay and sometimes they only have like one or two menu items. Why?

The whole place seems did functional."}
{"text":"Stay away from the Brisket sandwich, unless you like chopped fat.  Sandwich was 80% fat. Yuck!"}
{"text":"All I can say is disgusting. Spent the evening trying out the different food joints and the wine bar. First off the other food joints have a decent product. And the wine bar some pretty nice wines.
So the reason I am writing this review, Big Erns, disgusting. First off, during my travels through the park I saw one of the cooks getting drunk at the wine bar and then at the taco shop. When I saw him at big erns never saw him wash his hands. To me that's just disgusting. So to say the least I didn't order any food, just beware when you eat there."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town. You have to eat it and you will be amazed. Real BBQ in Vegas, about time."}
{"text":"Just had the Brisket and a side of Mac-n-Cheese with a roll. For $10, I didn't feel ripped off but I didn't feel like it was a great deal either.

The Brisket was Ok but I was kind of disappointed. Nothing worth going out of the way for in my opinion but than again, I've had Brisket from world class TX BBQ joints where Brisket is done right and is the crack of BBQ. (When I'm visiting relatives in TX, I'm pretty much ordering it up every other day... LOL.)

The brisket served to me was medium well done, no smoke ring, little to no rub, very lean and dry. It was tender but it just didn't have much flavor to to it. Highly doubt it's being smoked over Hickory. Not sure if it is the quality of the brisket they are using or if they are taking short cuts. Probably a combination of both from what I could tell. (Wholesale, a good quality brisket is going for only about $3 a lb so if you are going to turn around and sell it for $17 a lb, than don't take short cuts preparing it.)

Luckily the spicy BBQ sauce they have there is awesome and gave it some flavor. (Spicy BBQ sauce made this 3 stars instead of 2.) I normally use little to no BBQ sauce for Brisket done right but going through a container was pretty much mandatory for this Brisket.

Mac-n-Cheese -- Pretty good. Had better, had much worse.

Roll? Stale / Old and completely unacceptable to be served. The rolls I bought a couple of weeks ago sitting in my pantry that I'm saving for the ducks are in better shape.

Unfortunately, this is Vegas and finding some good Brisket done right is certainly a challenge."}
{"text":"I want to say who ever thought it was a good idea to change the cole slaw recipe has just made a huge mistake. I wonder if this so called head chef tried a taste test with its customers? This new cole slaw to me is very bland with no taste. Big Ern, you need to make a stand and bring back the original recipe. I rushed back to the Fiesta just because of the cole slaw. I was crushed to find out it wasn't the same. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"What great service. Chef Rio is awesome! The rib tips were succulent and the sides were to die for,  the Mac and cheese tasted homemade and the green's were so good I wanted more. It is now our favorite place downtown to eat. We walked out of several restaurants due to bad service last night and were so happy to find the best kept secret in Las Vegas. Chef Rio made our dining experience so much fun, he made everyone feel right at home. Next time you go downtown to the Freemont Experience make sure you stop at Big Ern's Barbecue at the Container shop plaza."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre but staff was friendly and helpful.. food was bland and tasted reheated.  Rib tips were pretty good"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst BBQ I've ever had. Don't waste your time. Food is expensive, bland, and dry."}
{"text":"I was in vegas in november getting married and we went their and ate. Food was great and Holly the cashier was soo  sweet and kind! Can't wait to go and see her again!"}
{"text":"portions are good-food very very bland-be sure to get lots of extra bbq sauce and you will be in heaven-as for the coleslaw and potatoe salad...needs lots of something more-the beans are delicious once some bbq or hot sauce is added - everything is just missing something"}
{"text":"I had the chopped beef brisket sandwich it was amazing! I would definitely recommend this place i love bbq. Better than Lucilles."}
{"text":"They get 1 star just because I couldn't give anything less. 

First, I go over the menu. They have combos (1, 2 or 3 meat choices) two sides and a roll. Priced fairly alright, but was hoping for more food for that price.

The food was out in less than 5. My gf and I shared a 3 meat combo. Ordered double order chicken and ribs and Mac and cheese since they had no fries!! One pbr and one bud light and paid $22.

Was expecting whole pieces of chicken instead I was eating shredded chicken. It was dry! BBQ sauce was good at least so I  poured it on the chicken. My ribs...well it was 3 pieces and had absolutely NO MEAT on them, and was chewy. I was licking the bone for some sort of substance but no luck. 

The Mac and cheese. I'm not sure that they even put ANY cheese in there to make it but the butter ....boy did they use butter. It's obviously been sitting in their hot food trays all day long. Scooped into a small paper bowl at the bottom was a whole lot of butter!!!! Yuck. I want to see cheese, not oil.

Roll was dry but at that point the whole meal was dissapointing.

At least I had some beer. Won't be going back, you're better off at a chain BBQ joint in town for better cuts of meat."}
{"text":"Was on the project downtown tour - heard the story - and passing out from heat - ate pulled pork and yummy in the tummy!!! Great friendly team too :)"}
{"text":"Two thumbs up for the pulled pork & pulled chicken sandwiches, both were super yummalicious!  The pulled pork was moist, not fatty, BBQ sauce was delish & served on a super soft roll.  The pulled chicken was surprisingly not dry & equally yummy.  Now for the sides...the pork & beans had too much of a tomato base & the coleslaw needed way more dressing.  The sweet tea was good, it attracted all those dang bees swarming around us as we ate.  I highly recommend eating on their little patio area rather than on the tables along the shrubs out front, unless you're a bee aficionado!  Our lunch total came to about $24, not bad."}
{"text":"I don't think I can begin to say enough good things about Ernie and his BBQ!!! 

We had Ernie cater a company party and I absolutely could not have been more pleased. For starters, Ernie was an absolute joy to coordinate everything with - all last minute on our part and all while he was in the middle of interviews for his new place. On to the food - we went with a fairly basic spread, but it was freaking delicious! I'm a big fan of the pulled pork and cole slaw (minimal mayo so it's not gross). 

I could go on, but the gist is 110% recommend Ernie and his BBQ! Very excited for when he opens up his space in the container park."}
{"text":"I am from NC and spent 13yrs in TX eating BBQ, I also cook quite a bit... so I know a little about it.  With that said, this has to be the worst BBQ I have ever eaten. Chicken was so dry I literally choked trying to eat it, sauce didn't even help. The brisket was almost as dry as the chicken.... Pork was tender but the flavor was lacking.... And the sweet tea.... Not so good. I would avoid if you like BBQ!"}
{"text":"Not the best BBQ I've ever had but coming from the south, this was still pretty good. Small space and short staffed but good food and good prices. Fun outdoor seating for people watching. Split a three meat combo with family and it was a lot of food. Good texture, nice sauces. I'll be back for ribs next time!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place. The food is reasonably priced with good portions. My dad got a pulled pork sandwich and said it was terrific. The coleslaw was oil and vinegar based and was super tasty. Fries were ok- not the best I've ever had but still tasty. We've been here on other occasions and have had many different items and have never been disappointed. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I stumbled across Big Ern's when checking out the Container Park. I'm always up for some good BBQ. The service was fast, and I got my food in 3 minutes! However, the food was just OK. The sides, in particular, were terrible. The macaroni was dried out with grease or oil settling at the bottom. It certainly wasn't fresh. What a shame because I love macaroni with melting and stringy cheese. You won't find that there. Also, the potato salad, another one of my favorite sides, was definitely from a jar or a box. It had that preservative, vinegary kind of taste. I took one bite and didn't eat the rest. The brisket, which I usually get when I go for BBQ, was OK and fairly juicy. It was just as small portion, though, and they could probably do more to trim off the fat. The worst thing was that it was very pricey--$9 something for two sides and meat. No way worth it, mainly because of the lack of quality. Get it together Ern!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food at a reasonable price. The hot links had a nice kick. Friendly staff would come back next time in town."}
{"text":"After seeing Big Erns being chosen Best of Las Vegas, the wife and I decided to give it a try.  We got there shortly after opening figuring the food would be at it's freshest.  My wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich and I had the chopped brisket sandwich.  We both had a bag a chips as our side, wanting to keep it simple, and a sweet iced tea.  

I'll start off with the sides, way over priced.  The bag of chips was $2 extra and amounted to the same chips you can get for about .75 in most convenience store, definitely not worth the money.  The sweet tea was quite good, not too sweet, though the serving sizes could have been bigger.  They also don't offer refills which would be nice, especially since chips are $2,00.

The sandwiches both had a good portion of meat and very little sauce, which I prefer.  If I want extra I'll add it.  There is nothing worse than a place that covers the meat in sauce to cover the taste of lousy bbq.  The brisket was moist and had a good flavor, not too much smoke.  The pulled pork on the other hand was rather bland.  It had no smoke flavor and there was no taste of the rub either.  I also found it odd that there was no bark on my wife's sandwich.  

How it got voted Best of Las Vegas is beyond me.  It's not that it was terrible, it was just average.   I would probably go back, but would order the meal instead of the sandwich.  For the same price as the sandwich and chips, you get two sides."}
{"text":"The beef brisket was amazing, as well as the beans and mac and cheese! Great food for the price!!"}
{"text":"I got the brisket sandwich, beans & shoestring fries!!! Soooo good. I'll ditch the beans next time though and try a different side."}
{"text":"This is my SPOT downtown. Friendly service and yummy food. I have tried almost everything on the menu and it is all delicious."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. The food is on point!
The pulled pork is fantastic and the brisket isn't far behind. Prices are reasonable espically considering portion size. 

If you are reading this and haven't decided where you are going tonight, go here because it's the best choice you will make.

Side note: I hate sweet potato fries but I don't hate these, they are delicious."}
{"text":"What a find.  My buddy and I literally stumbled upon this place after checking out Freemont Street.  The Container Park caught our attention and we noticed Big Ern's when we checked out what was inside the Container Park.  

I'm here to tell you this is some very good barbecue.  The pulled pork and beef brisket I had were both excellent, and the portions were generous for the price.  

For sides, I got the barbecue beans the cole slaw, which were both excellent.  

We were eating late (10:00 p.m.) on a Sunday night, which made eating out the tables very pleasant.  It even rained briefly, which cooled things down a bit even more.  I love a light rain in the desert in the summer.  

I found the prices to be very reasonable given he quality of the food and portion sizes. 

My only gripe is they locked the doors at 10:45 (15 minutes before closing), which meant I could not get a second beer, and my buddy could not get some more barbecue sauce.  We saw a small group of would be customers get turned away, also. If you say you close at 11:00, stay open till 11:00.  

Bottom line.  I've had good barbecue in Memphis.  This place is legit.  If you were to add collard greens and white bread and perhaps some fried pickles to the mix. . . ."}
{"text":"Great brisket and location in container city kid and dog friendly- right in front of kids treehouse playground. 

Off the beaten track from the strip- 6 people meals with beer less than 100 bucks"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with my meal.  The rib tips were old and dried out! Their prices do not reflect the quality of their food."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst bbq I've ever had. An absolute travesty what they are doing to their meat."}
{"text":"First time here. I had the three meat combo , hot links, pulled pork and rib tips. It was the bomb! Oh yea the mac n cheese was too. Definitely coming back to try it all!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I have been to Franklin's barbecue in Austin, so my review will be very tainted because I have been blessed to have the world's greatest barbecue. This wasn't bad brisket for Vegas but it wasn't very good for Texas barbecue. The pic 2 meet combo is a decent deal. I wasn't very impressed with the side options. All in all I would say it's below average barbecue."}
{"text":"Brisket sandwich was really good, the baked beans were solid. Try the spicy BBQ sauce, not too bad of a kick and very good flavor"}
{"text":"Awesome chicken and pulled pork!  Didn't expect such good BBQ in Vegas!  Getting the discount from our tix4tonight card was a bonus!! Great job!!"}
{"text":"I believe all their food is homemade. The Mac & Cheese is delicious! Has 3 different types of cheese in it. Their BBQ beans are yummy too! I got the pulled chicken & unfortunately found it very dried out. At least they have extra sauce to help moisten it up. A dinner roll is served with their meal with 2 sides. Wish they had bigger soda cup options. Lots of seating outside but not inside. It's worth trying them out @ least for their sides!"}
{"text":"Best dang BBQ ever! Great location in the container park, if you have kids you can enjoy your meal outside on the covered patio and your kids can play on the nice large open grass area or on the jungle gym. This place is great, really. They have the best ribs, I mean fall-off- the-bone tender, yummy! Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Brisket is delisious, melt in your mouth juicy. BBQ sauce is to die for, especially the spicy one. Sides are scrumptious, make sure you get their cheesy  mac, yum-o! Everytime I'm in Vegas this will be a for sure stop! The servers are awesome and Big Ern is the BEST!! Try it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken sandwich and Mac and cheese. My mom and daughter had the beef brisket and said it was good. I don't eat beef or pork so when I get taken to BBQ places I tend to eat a lot of dry chicken. Ern's chicken sandwich was tasty and moist. The sweet tea was refreshing and not too sweet but sweet enough. The staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Combo plate. Hot links and bbq beans fantastic .. brisket just a little dry but it was later in the evening.  I'm coming back for lunch and giving this place another go;)"}
{"text":"Big Ern's BBQ is a great place to stop in for lunch or dinner when visiting Downtown LV. Small dining area inside and patio seating outside is nice when the weather is right. You'll find your typical BBQ items and sides here. I've been here a few times now and will come back again."}
{"text":"We will not go back !!  The ribs looked big and meaty but were tough. The Mac n cheese was dry and no flavor  potato salad was the same. The pulled pork sandwich was dry and tasteless. Bun also dry. Fast service but what good is that when it is bad food. Sorry but I tell it like it is and I am not a real picky eater. Going to try the other restaurant there the next time......"}
{"text":"love this place and the food but my recent postmates experience was a little questionable. on the postmates menu there's a \"hot links\" plate for $10 which includes one side. when I received my food, there was only one hot link and the side. on the regular menu one hot link a la carte is $2.95. how does any of this make sense? did my driver eat one of my links?  also, the entire menu should be available on postmates as well, it can get kind of expensive if u would like more than one meat."}
{"text":"Everytime we visit Vegas we make sure to visit Big Erns BBQ. The food is so delicious and the staff is friendly and polite. Tonight my husband and I are having the brisket, rib tips, potato salad Mac and cheese. So good!"}
{"text":"3.5 but round up. really good brisket. the sausage was okay. pork and beans were okay and the coleslaw was good. ordering is slow but the food comes quick."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It's in the container park downtown and a real atmosphere in my opinion. The staff was eager and kind and a good menu witg lots of choices for mext time. The portions size was good and fair price to leave full. I will return here soon."}
{"text":"Family of 4 and we all loved our food. Great ribs and pulled chicken and pork. Also, Ern was there and very fun! We're from Arkansas and BBQ was comparable to Oklahoma, Memphis, or Kansas City. Great food and experience! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Smells better than it tastes! Not bad, sauce is good not great! Cole slaw not so good! Very bland! Beans...husband likes, me not so much! Would I come back....MAYBE!"}
{"text":"This is my first check in at Big Ern's. I ordered the 6 ribs with a side of bbq pork and beans, a bag of chips, and a dinner roll for $18.95 (drink not included). When I got my order, I was worried that my ribs looked dry and was just covered with sauce. I was amazed the meat was tender and absolutely not dry at all. 
However, the ribs were too smoky for my taste buds. I realize this may be  a preference to some people. I got helpings of both their spicy BBQ sauce and their original BBQ sauce. I personally wasn't crazy about the taste of the sauces. They do have a good number choices on their menu and I do plan to return and order the other meats they offer. Last but not least, the staff was friendly and very helpful with the menu choices."}
{"text":"Really good BBQ here!  Next time we will pay for extra meat because the portions were a little small.  But overall we liked the food and service."}
{"text":"I tried this because it was voted 'Best BBQ in Las Vegas'. I think the voters must have been paid. This was not the best bbq... I would say Famous Daves and Memphis (heck even Dickeys) would get my vote over this place. The servings were small, the food was dry, the flavor was not of high quality, and the gentleman who I am guessing is the owner just sat at a booth counting his money (literally) and ordered his employees around. He was very nice and gave my son a little toy but that doesn't change my views of the food."}
{"text":"Giving this place 4 stars for the good food. I'd like to give it 5, but it's a bit unorganized for me. I'm speaking from me and the boyfriend's experience, as well as observing other patrons' experience around us. 
Don't get me wrong 'cause all the people we talked to were nice. It's just that we initially got half our order, then when we waited about 10-15 minutes for the other half, one of the guys said he accidentally threw out our ticket. The kitchen made up for it by giving us a substitution, but I honestly know they lost some profit in doing that. I appreciate the accommodation, but can't help being worried if this constantly happens. So the food... 
Definitely like the barbecue sauces. The meat was tender enough that it didn't take much to tear apart. The Mac 'n Cheese was gooey with cheese, and I like the peppered flavor to it so that it wasn't bland. The Loaded Potato does not skimp on meat, beans, cheese or barbecue sauce. Oh man... I could've eaten that just by itself. 
I'd definitely go back for barbecue cravings."}
{"text":"Hot, fresh, home cooking! Served hot & tastes like home! Mac & cheese is very cheesy!! Bbq is outstanding! Friendly workers, too!"}
{"text":"Excellent and speedy service, superb food at a great price. Extremely hospitable and friendly, would definitely come back again. I recommend trying the beef brisket, it's incredible!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here before our Neon Museum tour on Wednesday night. I ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of beans and a Coke. Fabulous! Like a circus in my mouth. What a great meal and a great value. I will be back."}
{"text":"Stumbled across container park while walking around Vegas.  Ordered the Meat salad.  They do not skimp on the meat and it was delicious.  I eat BBQ all the time here in Texas and this was comparable with some of the best."}
{"text":"Lovely little spot. It was completely empty and we usually take that as a sign to not go, we thought fuck it. We want BBQ. 

Staff were amazing. Even gave me a sample to try when I was unsure what to order. Which worked because the Brisket was amazing. Not the best I've ever had but perfect for what I wanted then and there. Price was good. Servings were good. I'd go back here and sample the whole menu because straight after we took a seat tons of customers started coming in. I was eyeballing their plates one by one and Everything looked top notch. 

Excited to try this place again."}
{"text":"You can always trust a place that has PBR on tap and Big Ern's is no exception to the rule & at 2.95 for a 16 oz cup (i think) it's yet again a pleasure to see. I enjoy all of the sandwiches they have to offer. I like the pulled pork the most with the chicken and brisket tying for second. I really like the spicy BBQ sauce they offer on the side. 

The mac & cheese was not that home style 4 cheese slow baked I was hoping for. Instead it tasted like your run of the mill mac-n-cheese, which made my stomach sad.

Don't forget the free refills on lemonade, cha ching! That's a plus, especially if you plan on hanging at Container Park for a bit. If yiu plan on playing the light game where you run around like maniacs then be sure to grab yourself one of these. Don't waste your time asking about free refills on the PBR, it's apparently not up for negotiation lol

The kids menu is also a good bang for your buck weighing in at $5.95 for a decent sized slider w/ a side."}
{"text":"The smell of BBQ was enticing.  The quality fell short and was disappointing. The brisket was dry and barely room temperature. Ribs were somewhat decent.  It was like the racks were prepared early in the day and sat in a warmer all day. They were not hot and tough to chew. Hot links were not, and the smoked beans were probably the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because I had heard good things about it but I was thoroughly disappointed. I got the pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac and cheese. The meat was almost cold and the mac and cheese was pretty bland, it tasted like it had been sitting out. However, I tried some sweet potato fries and they were delicious.  Their barbecue sauces were pretty good as well. 
I feel like if I had come during a busy hour (when everything was fresh) I would have enjoyed my meal much more."}
{"text":"I told myself I wasn't going to leave a comment  but the food has gotta to a point where there is no taste the macaroni and ribs and rib tips are my favorite so I'm expressing myself your food has gotten blend to the point where I can't spend any more money there. I use to come twice a week to barely not coming due to a lack off seasoning so I'm just stating my opinion some my think other wise but your food taste wise has gotta worse you had a friendly staff but tasteless food now."}
{"text":"This little BBQ joint is inside Container Park,  such a cool little spot. We are here from out of town and enjoyed the BBQ, the ambiance and the prices were good."}
{"text":"First off, this place doesn't serve potatoes as a side.  That's a complete \"f#ck you\" to BBQ connoisseurs.  What kind of BBQ joint doesn't have a choice of french fries, baked potato, mashed potatoes or even just plain potato chips?  Potato SALAD?  Yeah, I'll have that with a side of diarrhea, please.  Disgusting.

Okay, well, first of all, don't believe the reviews.  I came here because it was recommended to me by Yelp!  Never again.  This place was an annoyance to get to, if you're familiar with downtown Las Vegas; it's right off Fremont Street at the aptly named Container Park.  What that means is that you'll be parking blocks away, feeding a meter, and then walking to your destination, rain or shine.

So I finally convinced myself to go.  I was feeling suicidal, which only leaves you two options: kill yourself, or get something good to eat.  I chose the latter this time.  I expected this to perk up my spirits, just a day before Lonely Christmas, but read on, fellow Yelpers...

After going out of my way to stalk this place, and in less than bitter spirits, I chose the three-meat combo in order to get it all out of the way; that's right, pulled pork, beef brisket and \"ribs.\"  Just \"ribs.\"  I had no idea what I was in for.

Paid the $15 (oh, did I mention I'm unemployed?) for the combo, in addition to the $1 in the meter (which I include in the bill, for the inconvenience).  Food came quickly; the line wasn't too bad.  Here's a round-up of the eats:

1) Pulled pork - the best part of the plate.  Stringy.  Cold.  But edible.  Pour a bunch of extra BBQ sauce on it because it is DRY.

2) Beef brisket - Hard.  Chewy.  You're forced to chew it for 5 minutes, then eventually swallow when you're tired of chewing.  This stuff was TERRIBLE.  Not recommended at all.

3) \"Ribs\" - NOT MEANT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.  I don't even know what part of the pig this was.  The tendons?  It was not even remotely chewable.  I attempted to eat half of one, then asked for a to-go box for the remainder of the brisket and ribs.  I've never done that before.  Usually I finish it all in one go.  And that's not a compliment regarding the portions.

The combo also came with a \"roll.\"  I.E. Half a hamburger bun.  Yes, you read that right.  Half a f#cking hamburger bun.  Merry f#cking Christmas.

My dog will eat well tonight."}
{"text":"Yum! Worth the walk from nasty old Fremont street. Both the brisket and pulled pork, the super simple side salad and beans were all great. All the employees were kind and courteous. Oh.. And added bonus that they have Shiner bock too!"}
{"text":"This is a tasty comfort and soul food spot. We were tipped off by our über driver to give this place a shot. You can smell the barbecue from the whole surrounding area. When we walked in, the chef took our order and rang us up. Everything my husband and I had was tasty and cooked to perfection. This restaurant is located Inside of an old shopping container, so it's small and seating is limited inside. It gives the whole place a really close feel, as if you are having a huge family dinner with a bunch of strangers. But in a good way. When we were there, they played young Michael Jackson songs. It was a fun experience, good price ($25 for two people) and really really good food!"}
{"text":"The reviews are right. This place is not worth it if you want real bbq. I had the ribs and rib tips. The ribs were ok and they were tender but they were not smoked. Id be surprised if any of it is smoked. It all tastes like it was cooked in an oven with liquid smoke and spices. The meat is low quality. Very fatty and not a lot of actual meat. In fact the least greasy thing I had was the fries. Lol. The rib tips were either nothing but grisel or they were burnt and dry. If you are desperate you can give it a try, but comparing this to bbq is like saying taco bell is Mexican food."}
{"text":"The only things this place has going for it is the location, open kitchen, and cute bandana-print table cloths. Oh, and they provide WetNaps at the condiment station.

-1 Basic, unappealing menu. Sides have been pared down, the mac and mashed potatoes others mention in reviews are nowhere to be found. Don't take away side choices, improve them!  Choices are now just baked beans (tasted canned), coleslaw (too much mayo), a bag of chips, or a baked potato. $2 each with the purchase of a sandwich, 2 included in the cost of most plates. No thanks. 
-1 So. Much. Grease. I know barbecue isn't health food, but my order shouldn't be sitting in a puddle of grease. I literally dropped my chopped brisket sandwich because the bun was so slick. Gross!
-1 The barbecue sauce pump is empty at 1PM. Now I know y'all ain't had so much business that it all got eaten in a few hours. This should be checked daily before you even open. 
-1 No flavor, aside from grease and sauce. The brisket had great fall-apart texture and (more than) enough fat, but if you tried a bite without sauce it was bland. 
-1 It's 105 degrees outside and the cashier makes no mention of beverages? At the very least, a cup of water should be standard.

The $9 sandwiches are a good portion size, but the price is irrelevant if the product isn't appealing enough to finish. Also, this is the first place I've ever been that doesn't offer sliced pickles and onions to garnish your brisket sandwich."}
{"text":"Came in the other day and ordered the Brisket with a side of coleslaw, and my boyfriend ordered the half rack of ribs with mac and cheese.
The bbq tasted like it was reheated, slaw was very meh. Only decent thing was the mac and cheese and the service. Better to spend your money on eating somewhere else at container park!"}
{"text":"Waited 50min for a 3 meat platter and 3 sides. The workers were fine but management screwed them by scheduling one cashier and one cook on Sunday, January 15, 2017. They literally cannot keep up with the foot traffic for MLK weekend. If you stop by and see two workers total, don't order anything, it'll most likely have you waiting over 30 or 40 minutes for your food. Other customers around me were waiting longer or as long as I was."}
{"text":"Excellent brisket, pulled pork, links, chicken and all the regular sides. Beers on tap and in the can, and even a good cider to quench your thirst.

Situated inside Container Park, Big Ed's is a cozy traditional barbecue joint with four or five tables inside the shipping container structure, and about a dozen out on the balcony.

A great addition to a funky, chill nabe."}
{"text":"Great ribs
Enjoyed the beans and pork
Wife liked the chili
Nice people
Definitely a keeper"}
{"text":"Well what an experience this was.... 
Try attending the WINTER WONDERLAND to let my daughter experience something joy full to do for the holidays and it was closed(see review on that). 
Walked in my partner and child(4 years old) ordered a pulled pork sandwich with a 2 item (bris & ribs) VERY DRY CHUCKS & Ribs were all fat.
My pork sandwich was very dry went to add more bbq sauce to only LMAO that it wasn't even and homemade recipe( FYI meal was 23 bucks) should be able to get something more from the heart. The 2 meat combo that my partner order came with 2 sides got bbq beans and salad( NOT MUCH CHOICES FOR SIDES) in the meantime we both look at each other saying why did we send 20 on a fast food bbq that was so horrible. So my child took a bite of the salad then decide she didn't want it....
So I started to eat the salad to bite into a twisty tie (like the ones that come on bread bags). I almost lost it. Stayed calm because my 1st thought was what if my 4 year old got it so I immediately stop eating we excuse are selves and my partner goes to the cashier and demands the money back. She did and offered my partner a beer but I will never never ever eat there again. Last statement I noticed there was a award FOR BEST LAS VEGAS BBQ something for this year. Wow judges not sure what you do to let these business win because they do not deserve an award..."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Las Vegas!

The staff was very helpful and friendly. 
The food is amazing! The portions are big! I think I have tried most of their meats, and I absolutely love everything!  So, happy to see chicken back on the menu!

I also love the Container Park... awesome vibe!

I can recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"The BBQ food is decent, but the employees are not very friendly. They told us they would walk our food out to us. 30 minutes later still no food. We walk back inside only to be told by the cashier to go to the guy working the kitchen. I stood there for a good few minutes and he never even attempted to see if I needed help. Finally when my husband came in, I was apparently good enough to talk to. I told him that we had ordered our food 30 minutes ago and no one called our names. He told us very matter of factly that we should have listened for our name. I know for a fact they never walk out to the porch area to call our names as we were sitting there the entire time and there was about 4 of us. I heard them walk out to the porch and call others. At least one of us would of heard the name. I wasn't even too mad about the late food, it was the fact that he was extremely rude and even made it seem like we were idiots that didn't know how to listen for our own names. He could of acted like he cared a bit more. I don't know how the mix up happened, but it did. I usually came here often for food, and my husband usually stops in for dinner during his shifts if he is in the area. I'm sorry to say that we won't be back again."}
{"text":"Pretty good! This was way better than I expected. Got the three meat plate with bbq Chilli as a side. Three meats were half chicken, spare ribs and brisket. Everything tasted great! Customer service was equally good. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food was good people were super nice. Large portions.   And it was very reasonable.  The brisket was really good."}
{"text":"I remember Big Ern from back in his Farmers Market days ! Everything about their food & sauce just keeps getting better and better. I eat here/refer people here every opportunity I get !"}
{"text":"After our Zappos tour, we headed over to the Downtown Container Park as it's part of Zappos CEO, Tony Hsieh's new $350M downtown Las Vegas initiative.  Big Ern was one of Zappos' employees who decided to follow his dream and have his own BBQ place.  I do agree with fellow Yelpers that the menu is not that order friendly initially but what I ordered was pretty good.  Obviously, I stayed away from the pulled pork after reading all the not-so-wonderful reviews on that item. I ordered the brisket salad and it was very flavorful and tasty.  The workers were nice and courteous as well.  I guess I just felt that the overall value and experience was not as good as the ones I had experienced in Texas. If you do visit the Downtown Container Park and crave BBQ, I would go with the brisket as it's quite tender and tasty. I also ordered the rib tips and they were ok, but not something I would order again. Wish I could give this place higher ratings, but I must stay true to my reviews."}
{"text":"First off, the ribs are the bomb. Plenty of good smoke on them and they hit the perfect balance of bite and tender. Secondly, the coleslaw is definitely in my top 5 ever. A good mix of crisp veggies with not too much sweet. Pork n beans were right in expectations, definitely homemade. Thumbs up! (I would have taken a pic, but I ate it too fast)"}
{"text":"I work downtown and look for places where I can get a decent quick meal at under ten bucks.  There are many options in the area and in the Container Park.   I have tried them all and I know I can always depend on Big Erns.  I saw some bad reviews and just wanted to add a few things.

I am from Texas, so this is not the best BBQ I have ever had, but it is darn good and consistent for the price.  I like the pulled pork and have never had issue with the buns in the ten or so times I have eaten the pulled pork sandwich.   I like that they give me the choice of putting on as much or as little of either mild or spicy barbecue sauce.  I like that the drink prices are low and you don't see that \"concession stand\" attitude to pricing that some downtown establishments have.

The service has much improved and I like that Big Ern is often right there talking and meeting customers.   

I am a regular here and will continue to be.  Good barbecue at a good price.  To be balanced, I like the beans but do find the potato salad bland, though it looks fantastic.   Still room for some improvement,  but a solid place that can be counted on!"}
{"text":"Tasteless and dry. That goes for the meat and sides. The worst bbq I have had in vegas. The two stars were for the portion size and fast and friendly service"}
{"text":"One word \"SEASONING!\" The food was VERY bland and there was no \"smoked\" flavor on the BBQ. I got the 3 meat combo with mac&cheese again NO seasoning annnd barely any cheese & baked beans (not sweet at all)  :-( . 

I gave them 2 stars because they did give a good portion size. However a nice sized portion of bland food wasn't the goal. I won't be going back ..."}
{"text":"Ordered combo plate with BBQ Beef Brisket, Hot Link and spare ribs.  All of them taste really good with lots of meat in it.  I really like the fries as well.  Very fresh and tasty with the spice.  The location is at the center of the Container Park which is very convenient as well!  Great place!"}
{"text":"I never realized that I couldn't get a BBQ pull pork sandwich in the downtown area until I did. After leaving a music festival in the area I came across a giant praying mantis shooting out flames. It was the container park, so we took a stroll inside. 
The park it's self is kind of cool. They do all types of events. Feeling a little hungry came across a few eateries inside the park. 

  For some reason BBQ sounded good so in I went to Big Ern's. Kept it simple and got a pull pork sandwich & potato salad. Nothing wrong with the food, or service. People were cool and the food was good. Enjoyed the BBQ sauce. Nothing super special at the same time it was flavorful, with a hint of smokey flavor. Potato salad is a simple homemade style. Enjoyed it all, it was a good refuel to continue the night in downtown Vegas. Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"It was Meh. Nothing to write home about. Nothing to complain about. The food just lacked a bit of soul that bbq has... Like if you're in a fix and you need some bbq go here but if you can just go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had a plate with:
- Ribs
- Brisket
- Macaroni & Cheese
- Coleslaw

Food
========
Brisket was the best item of the plate.

Ribs didn't fall off the rib and were a little to dry for my taste. As sides go, I picked what should be the best indicators of a bbq joint, both of which were incredibly disappointing. They were both bland and lacked that kick that should be saying, \"Welcome to big Ern's, you've just been branded for life by our signature sides!\" Hoping they'll tweak them a little bit.

Service
========
Note: It was the first official day of the container park, so take this part of the review with a grain of salt and I wouldn't consider it indicative of a typical visit. **Service has no bearing on my star rating.**

Ordering took a while. It could've been the spike in customers and first time for the cashiers to be using Square, but it took a really long time for an individual to place an order (somewhere around 2 minutes, which is significant considering how fast the process should be at a place where they take your order at a counter).

Service line was fast, but they forgot one of my sides.

Overall, everyone working there was really nice and I think they probably have some kinks to work out, but the main things I'd look for next time I go back are more enjoyable/memorable sides and ribs that make your mouth water whenever you hear someone mention Big Ern's."}
{"text":"Great tasting BBQ and amazing Sauces!! Loved the atmosphere:) came here while on my bday trip with family and we loved it! Definitely coming here again"}
{"text":"great environment and friendly staff. The reason I give it 3 stars is because the food is mediocre and the portions are small. I ordered a 2 meat combo for about $13 and that was barely enough (no drink included). Container park is pretty cool though and foot traffic will probably overcome the shortcomings of the menu/food"}
{"text":"The best barbecue place in town! Pulled pork sandwich was great. Their chili was a great idea for the side. Just spicy enough. The staff are like family. Thanks Ryan!!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday around 8pm, ordered a pulled pork sandwich, my sandwich came out less than a few mins, so that made me think this could be a bad sandwich. And I was right. 

I didn't like their buns were cold and the meat was too dry, not enough sauce, I had to add some myself after a few bites. Later the worker told me that they don't have a toaster to warm the buns but if I want the buns warm next time, I could ask them to put them on the warmer for me. I probably won't try their pulled pork again, maybe their brisket next time."}
{"text":"We are sitting here now and I had to stop to give these guys some credit because we were appalled at the low star reviews. 

We stumbled upon the Container park when we went looking for the Arts District 
The brisket is moist and the fat cap on it is loaded with flavor. The pulled pork is delicious and the bbq sauce is just right. 

The portion sizes are large and the price is affordable.  We shared the 3 meat combo plate that comes with 2 sides and a roll for $14.95. We hadnt had anything to eat all day so we were starving and still this was enough for us. 

I wish we could come back but we live a little ways away.... about 2,519 miles. 

See ya next time!


Thanks Big Erns for a delicious ending to our West Coast vacation.  :)"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm from Portland so I'm not an expert when it comes to bbq. All I can say is this is the best bbq I've ever had. My boyfriend and I shared the 3 meat plate and it was way more food than even a couple of hungry wrestlers could eat. A couple of PBRs and banana pudding were the perfect accompaniment. 

The staff is really helpful and eager to give suggestions. If you're near Downtown and you like amazing meat, come find this place!"}
{"text":"They weren't friendly and almost everything I tried to order had some rule that prevented me from getting the quantity I preferred. Every meat seemed to be styled from a different city (Kansas City brisket, Memphis pulled pork, St.louis ribs, etc.) so the place really didn't have it's own identity. The sides looked good but really lacked flavor. For example, the potato salad looked fabulous but really didn't taste like anything; the macaroni and cheese tasted like butter I guess. The biggest problem was the way they presented the meat. I ordered a three meat plate and they poured sauce on everything (NOT a good sign) and basically scrunched all three meats into a bowl. The brisket was thin and chewy, basically no smoked flavor. It also had cracks in it, so I guess they don't cut to order (either that are they are really doing something wrong). The ribs looked promising, but again they were chewy and no smoked flavor. The pork had slightly more flavor and the texture seemed right but the sauce was inappropriate (pulled pork typically has a thin vinegar sauce on the side, not BBQ sauce on top). Honestly, I didn't finish it and as much as I hate to waste food I threw at least half of it away."}
{"text":"I eat at a lot of BBQ joints in the US.  I prefer the mom and pop shops over the chains like Lucilles or Dicks or Famous Daves.  The reason is that the mom and pop places have fresher food and tend to be more home made.  As far as Big Erns...   I had the pulled pork and the pork and beans.  Their pulled pork ranks right up there with my other favorite BBQ places.  Their BBQ sauce is very good as well.  I wasn't impressed with the beans as I tend to go for the baked beans with the sweet taste.  Not saying it isn't good but something I've never experienced in a BBQ joint.  Otherwise this place is super clean and the price was right for the large amount of food you get."}
{"text":"We spent a few days in Vegas recently and wanted to find something new to do that wasn't on the strip. We have a big family and this is a toughie sometimes. I searched yelp and came across this bbq place. We really love bbq and I've been wanting a reason to come check out the container park for a long time. 

Loved the ambiance and eating on the \"porch\" of this container restaurant while my children played in the awesome structure across from it. 

I liked my wings and fries a LOT. Kids didn't love the pulled pork sandwiches but they loved the fries. I am so sad to say this but I hated the bbq sauce. Not my style at all and maybe that's why the kids didn't like the sammies. Portions were a good size and the meal was really filling but it was quite expensive. Drinks were expensive too and came in a 12 oz plastic cup and no refills. Eek. 

Service was very friendly, but slow. They also seemed pretty shocked at the size of our order lol. Outside of Utah I guess having 5 kids is kind of unusual."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh ribs. Amazing macaroni and cheese. Great customer service from the guys. Big Ern was there! He was very interested in our opinion, and made sure we had a great experience. He genuinely cared, and even let us try the bread pudding complimentary. Their BBQ sauce is honestly the best I've ever had! If you're in downtown Las Vegas, and you like BBQ, this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Best darn Mac n cheese I've had! Hubby had pulled pork sandwich,  said it was good, but would like less BBQ sauce. I had the smoked brisket sandwich, very good, no complaint. Go to Big Erns, try the BBQ and the Mac n cheese!"}
{"text":"Big Ern's is a great dining option in the Downtown Container Park. They serve up delicious BBQ and drinks. There is limited seating area both inside and out so make sure you go with a group to save a seat.  The line does get pretty long to order but is well worth the wait. I ordered the pulled pork platter with a side of collared greens and pork and beans. My wife and friend ordered the brisket which was also an excellent choice... It was so moist! 

Their biscuits are perfectly soft and melt in your mouth but also work well to pick up the extra BBQ sauce from your plate lol! My mouth is watering as I write this review! 

I can't wait to get back for sure when in the area... 

Just wasn't able to get a refill on our drinks because there was only one person working the register and soda machine... Damn.  

Next time I'll try something new. I'm sure it will be good.

Give this a place a try when you're in the area."}
{"text":"It's a mediocre BBQ spot in the Container Park. We came here one night after a few drinks, so we were a bit tipsy and very hungry. My friend and I opted to share a platter, with ribs, pulled pork and hot links. We also got a side of mac and cheese. The links weren't particularly spicy. The ribs and the pulled pork were both tender, but it seemed like it was missing flavor. It really needed the BBQ sauce to add enough flavor. The BBQ sauce was actually pretty good. The mac was cheesy, but not particularly memorable. 
The restaurant is barebones. There were a few tables, but it was pretty empty on a weekday evening."}
{"text":"Service sucks, woman who was cashier super rude.. they are limited to what they serve... not recommended at all.. food was disgusting"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great people. You need to try the Pecan pie and the PBR. This is some of the best BBQ downtown. We are until we couldn't eat anymore."}
{"text":"Not bad BBQ- and priced well compared to the other options in the downtown area. 

The fried okra is fantastic! The rest was pretty average- the pulled pork had great flavor but was a bit on the dry side. Nice bbq sauce too. 

Downsides- out of brisket at 8:30. I just watched a large group walk out the door that would have been good for at least $150 because they were out of items, and the fryer was shut down for the night! With so many fried items on the menu and such great okra, why would you turn the fryer off 2 hours before closing time!? That's how you go out of business....."}
{"text":"Decided to try eating here our first time to the Container Park. The reason for the 1 star deduction is they were out of ice and the mac n cheese was just ok. The BBQ chicken, sweet potato fries and ribs were all yummy though. We did get a free side for checking in on Yelp and the people were friendly."}
{"text":"I came here because my son wanted to go out and eat on a Friday.I kept seeing articles that says \"support the downtown movement\". So I said, as a resident of Vegas, let me do my part.  
We ordered the rib dinner for my 13 year old son because we saw someone else eating it and it looked pretty good. I hate to say, but the negative reviews are right!!!
I guess me and my son appearance looked so \"hungry\" they thought we would eat anything they put on our plate. They gave us 3 ribs instead of 4 like they were suppose too. I let that slide and did not say anything. Mind you...my son is the kind of kid that eats \"everything\" you put in front of him, however, he took one bite of these ribs and said \"Mom, I don't want anymore. They were dry and it was inconceivable that someone will serve such hard cold ribs to someone thinking they will not notice. I didn't complain like I would normally do if a restaurant give us sub-par food because I already made up in my mind I wont be back. I was severely turned off due to them serving my son food that looked like it been sitting there 3 or 4 hours. That was enough to steer me from this place for good. Looking at the pics on this page, I'm pretty sure they do serve good food at times, however, looks like we came on a bad night at the wrong time."}
{"text":"Beef brisket is like meat flavored butter! Delicious! Best bbq in the West ... easily! Worth the trip from the strip!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ.  I haven't had pulled pork this good since I left the Midwest.  And the desserts taste like your momma made them from scratch.  I'm glad I found this place and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good customer service. I ordered wings and they were good. I expected them to be whole wings bc the menu said jumbo wings. The pineapple upside down cake was good, the ribs were also pretty good."}
{"text":"I ordered jumbo chicken wings from Uber eats and I ordered it with fries and paid for the fries and when it came no fries chicken is burnt called them about what happened just told me to reorder it so I will pay for it again lol that's a good way to double charge a customer"}
{"text":"This place was really good. The pulled pork was exceptional. Try the beans and the Mac n cheese; they were also very good. Skip the bread. It's just a dry regular dinner roll. We will return next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Deep sigh... I've been here two maybe three time (once was for free courtesy of my job) and the only thing that has stood out in my mind was the fact that they were out of everything. 

Tonight was no different. After waiting in line for about 5minutes someone yells from the back \"we're out of :::insert majority of the menu items here::\" I have been craving bbq for weeks so I decided to stay in line and hope for the best. Funny thing the couple behind me made a comment about how dirty the kitchen looked. I thought to myself \"it's a bbq place, what do you expect...\" In hindsight I feel like that was the Universe trying to tell me something. 

After what seemed like an eternity's wait I finally made it to the cashier, who made no effort to hide her readiness to be off  he clock already. I intended to order a hot link plate, baked beans, and potato salad. But, you guessed it, they were out of potato salad, so I ordered the greens instead. I waited for my food, a girl, looking even more miserable that the first, brought it to me on a \"for here\" plate. I asked her if I could get it to go & sh begrudgingly obliged, after asking me again \"are you sure you don't want to just eat here.\" 

Fast forward.

Get home, ready to dive into the meal that I've been craving. I break open the dinner roll and low and behold there's MOLD. Needless to say I had to trash the whole damn meal and I'm certainly pissed mostly be I was so close to feeding the craving -__- Definitely won't be eating here again and I will strongly advise my company to not cater from here either  

I never write these things looking for anything in return but this time I definitely want my money back."}
{"text":"Wow! 
We stopped in for a quick bite - ribs, pulled pork, beans n slaw. It all was amazing! The beans werent too sweet. The ribs we cooked to perfection!! and nothing was over salted. 
The staff was more then friendly, we felt very at home. The owner Ern was there and immediately greeted us with a smile. I was impressed all around! 

a must go!"}
{"text":"I was in the area visiting and decided to try this spot.  I love what they did to this area.  Very creative.  I want something different so bbq fit the bill.  This place was decorated nicely so I stopped in.  I was greeted by a nice guy and the ambiance was family like.  I ordered the bbq brisket w/fried okra....a celebration of home...I also checked in on Yelp and got a free side which I asked for the collard greens w/turkey meat....omg...reminded me of my mom's.  The root beer was tasty & refreshing on this hot day.  The cook and the chef did a fabulous job.  This is a must stop by.  Delish food, great service.  I will definitely stop by next time I'm in LV."}
{"text":"The reviews for Big Ern's seem to run (literally) hot and cold. I noted this on my handy dandy Yelp app, but also saw that the reviews for their previous pop-up location nearby were much better so I decided to give them a try. I'm glad I did - this was some pretty darn good BBQ.

I went for a three meat combo - I picked brisket, pulled pork, and hot links - which served with 2 sides. I went with Mac-n-Cheese and baked beans for the sides. I saw a lot of complaints about the price, but the $14.99 price tag on this platter is on par with the BBQ places I am familiar with in the DC-area, and the portion size was ample. (See photo)

Here's how I would breakdown the meal:

Outstanding: The brisket and the hot links. The beef brisket is among the best I have ever had. It was very juicy with the right level of smoke flavor. Not too smoky, not too bland. And the hot links were equally yummy ... a nice hint of heat, but not overpowering, and a great texture and flavor to the link.

Good: The sauce, the roll, and the beans. They only have one kind of sauce, and it's a sauce on the sweeter side, but not overly sweet like a KC style sauce. It has a nice balance of sweet and tangy. And the roll was very nice. (Both were much needed for the pulled pork.) The baked beans were good ... they may be canned beans as noted by another review, but they were cooked nicely with a nice blend of green pepper and onion with it. Nothing special, but they were tasty.

Meh: The pulled pork and mac-n-cheese. The pulled pork was surprisingly bland. There just wasn't much flavor with it at all. On a positive note, when placed on the bun with their house BBQ sauce, it went down nicely. But good pulled pork should stand alone, and this didn't. The mac-n-cheese reminded me of what my mom used to make. That's not a good thing, because my brother and I disliked it so much that we begged mom for Kraft instead. It's homemade, but it's basically taking block cheese and melting it with macaroni ... the oil from the cheese separates and makes it a bit of a mess.

And don't worry, you can get your beer on here too. None of the local craft brews that the other places in Container Park offer, but they stick to the hipster theme of their location, offering Fat Tire and PBR. (Yes, PBR has become THE hipster \"common\" brew) I hadn't had a PBR in a while, and enjoyed it with my BBQ. 

With more hits than misses, I'll give Big Ern's a solid 4 stars ... I'd definitely come back again for the brisket and the hot links."}
{"text":"First of all, if you're in the Downtown Las Vegas area, you need to head over to Container Park just to experience it. That, alone, is a great reason to visit Big Ern's.

Just like every other business at the park, this restaurant is installed in an old shipping container, which limits its size, but increases its novelty.

But you probably want to hear about the food. It's reasonably priced. Each meat plate is $10 for 5oz of meat, 1 side, and bread. Pretty good. And if you want an additional 5oz, you just pay an extra $5. It's a good deal if you want to try one of their sides. Otherwise, it's $17 for a pound of brisket.

The brisket itself was extremely tender. And with little fat on it, too--increasing the amount of actual edible meat you get. At first, I was curious why they just gave me a fork and no knife, but I soon realized the knife wasn't needed. You can cut right through it like fish (that is, if you're not already eating it with your hands). 

In fact, this meat would be at the top of my list if it weren't for the lack of distinct flavor--even if it had just a little. But pre-sauce, this meat had basically none. It's hard not giving it more points.

It's a good thing the sauce was tasty enough. It would've been a shame if it wasn't. While not the best, it definitely did the job in not making the meat quality be in vain. The sauce was harder to put my finger on. The cook in the back said it's \"California style,\" but I concluded it was more similar to Texas. But a little thicker than normal, and with a higher amount of sweetness. Almost Pepsi-nuanced. Maybe you could call it a peppery California sauce.

The baked beans were just okay, but if you add a little (or a lot) of BBQ sauce, they turn into something pretty good. The mac & cheese was my favorite of the sides. They were made with real cheese and had a comforting homemade feel. And they weren't too cheesy.

I have a weird thing for BBQ places that don't have cornbread, but at least they give you a dinner roll with each plate.

I would definitely come back to Big Ern's. If nothing else but as an excuse to visit the underappreciated Container Park. But it's reasonably priced for what you get--quality and all."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ! The price was excellent for how much food you get. The staff and owner were very nice and helpful. The environment in and around Big Ern's was great for adults and kids. We ate here twice while we were in town.

The meat was tender and moist, the beans had great flavor, potato salad was great, and yummy mac'n'cheese."}
{"text":"Smells great around this Container Park eatery, but the food is a much different story. Since neither a baked potato or mashed potatoes were included with their combos,  I chose the pork ribs combo platter with coleslaw and a green salad, while my love chose brisket with BBQ pork & beans and a green salad. Not normally a brisket lover, this brisket converted me; which made much more sense after trying to eat one of the pork ribs, because it tasted like beef jerky on a stick. The ribs were so undercooked that the grizzle was perfectly intact and not only looked, but chewed like gum. I realized that the reason their brisket tasted so delicious, was actually because it hadn't been cooked as long as normal, not even quite sure they know of this accidental perfection. I just wished they accidentally left their ribs on the barbie instead. The best part about the place was the option to pour my own BBQ sauce on the side. Trying to overlook the ribs I moved onto the coleslaw. It was seasoned lightly, served in a soupy consistency, but not half bad. I think they may have forgot to salt the cabbage, because the water kept coming, no matter how many times I drained it. I couldn't say much for the green salad, because it was more like a dead, wilted, slimey salad. They tried to hide limp black lettuce, along with rusted romain ends, under fresh green pieces; very shady if you ask me. I should have taken the counter girls bad customer service as a big hint to run to the next place fast, but it smelled so good I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I would buy a few sides of the BBQ baked beans to go from Big Ern's, because they were out of this world, loaded with shredded meat and could have easily been my meal; but never ever would I order the ribs or green salad from this place again. With so many awesome eateries and choices in Las Vegas, I say try another one. The place is small, and on any given day 2 of the 5 inside tables are taken by management."}
{"text":"I ordered the one meat combo and chose spare ribs and Mac and cheese. The ribs were fall off the bone and their sauce is pretty damn tastey! The Mac and cheese was also amazing, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best BBQ I've had!! The sauce was banging, spicy and original, and the service was exquisite!! 
I had Pulled pork, chicken and spare ribs with potato salad!! ON POINT!"}
{"text":"First time here from Connecticut, from the food to the staff to the ambiance everything was great!!"}
{"text":"This is one of two restaurants I've been to in Container Park. I'm a big BBQ fan so it just made sense to come visit. Opted for their special on the barbecue pork sandwich it was pretty good the inside dining areas a bit cramped but I realize it's a Hollow  shipping container and not a conventional restaurant building. The outside patio is pretty cool if you want to dine outside which is very pleasant in the cooler months. The Fry's run little bit Bland but the barbecue sauce is good. It is good for the price and the location."}
{"text":"Undercooked, gamey and somewhat tasteless....a fail in my opinion. Very disappointed..Red pork? Seriously? Felt a bit sick after eating there."}
{"text":"I just tried this place for the first time and was very pleased. As you walk in you can see everything being freshly prepared. I can only assume the man taking our order was the owner. He was incredibly friendly. The rest of the staff was as well. I ordered the two meat combo with brisket, ribs, mac&cheese, and potato salad that also came with a biscuit. Everything was delicious. The meat was moist and tender. Their barbecue sauce was very flavorful. The sides all tasted like fresh, homemade food. Not like boxed mac&cheese or anything like that. I will definitely be stopping by here next time I want some good barbecue."}
{"text":"I wanted so much to love this place. But I was sadly let down. I love good bbq and the brisket I ordered was not bbq it was like broiled or boiled and shredded. Who shreds brisket? Really ? The sauce was homemade but you could tell they let it boil as they were making it it had a horrible vinegary taste. I was so bummed. But I guess this bbq is good enough for yuppies."}
{"text":"Great BBQ.  Loaded potatoes w/pulled pork and Mac & Cheese were wonderful. Good sized Garden Salad for $5.  Looked fresh too."}
{"text":"I saw Big Ern's in the new business section on Yelp.  I bookmarked it and made a mental note to check it out next time I was downtown.  My go to BBQ order is links, mac n cheese and coleslaw.  I was excited that they had all three on their menu.  It is a small food stand so understandably the menu is limited.  The first time we went to Big Ern's they only had a few of the items on the menu.  The night before was First Friday and they said that it had wiped them out.  We were bummed but understood.  We didn't order anything that day but promised we would be back.  We went back today a little before noon (they open at 11) and they were out of ribs, links and mac and cheese.  I'm not sure if they just make a small amount and it was really sold out or they don't have it everyday.  They made it seem like they had already sold out.   So def try and get there early or call ahead to see what they have.  Our choices were pulled pork, brisket, chicken and for sides potato salad, coleslaw and baked beans.  We got brisket, chicken, beans and potato salad.  They were all really good and the meat had a great smoke flavor.  I just wish we could have tried the ribs, links and mac which is what we usually order at a bbq place.  Both times the staff was super nice and helpful.  I will try them again, but will call first to see if they have my faves.

Update: I saw on Eater that they are going to have a permanent location in Container Park."}
{"text":"After walking by this place for well over a year today was the day I decided indulge.  I went on a mid afternoon stroll through the container park and none of the other places got me salivating like Big Ern's BBQ.  It was a quiet day at the Container Park and the rare desert  rain just stopped falling.   After looking over the menu and asking a few questions It looked like the pulled pork sandwich and side of pork and beans was the winning choice.  

The food came out quickly and there was a very decent portion of meat on the bun.  The roll was very soft and fresh and the pork was very juicy and tender.  Big chunks of pork smothered in sauce with just the right amount of fat and bark to make a vegetarians mouth water.  I prefer my BBQ sauce to have a little more heat to it because this was made to cater to all tastes of BBQ lovers.  I did not even ask if other sauces were available because I was sooo hungry.  the pork and beans were very good and had come out scolding hot not like the pork sandwich which was luke warm. My beans had big chunks of meat and a little bit of spice.  I would go back for these for sure, after working my way around the menu.  

The one down fall of this experience was the service.  I understand that this is a lazy rainy day at the CP.  All the more reason the operators have to go for it, this is the time to give that WOW! service everyone is looking for.  When I arrived both team members were in the dining room one on phone the other doing who knows what.  While trying to make conversation about the business the response most given was \" I don't know I am not the owner\".  A little turned off by this.  Then I had to ask about the rain several times and it was like no one was listening and then the answers were directed at me like I was a tourist.  Yeah turned off by this also.  

I decided to sit outside and enjoy my meal in solitude while watching the rain fall.  Very relaxing and boy I needed that after the weekend I had.  I am giving the 4 stars for the food and 3 stars for the mediocre service.  I will be back to try the Ribs and the Brisket."}
{"text":"Pulled pork was decent, briskets were alright... they lacked in flavor, and the spare ribs tasted like lighter fluid (needed a lot of bbq sauce).

I also disliked how they only had two bottles of bbq for everyone to share. I had to go to different tables because people would be hogging it. Wouldn't hurt for you guys to invest in more sauce bottles or at least a sauce dispenser so customers don't end up hogging the sauce."}
{"text":"Ern makes some good BBQ. Head over there when the food is fresh so you can get it while it lasts! I've had pretty much everything on the menu, but my favorites are the Rib Tips and chopped brisket sandwich. Grab some beans and coleslaw on the side, and you've got a solid meal.

On top of the great food, everyone working there is very nice and they love the BBQ game."}
{"text":"Located Downtown inside the Container Park. 

I've been here twice now and both times were fairly pleasant. The first time I visited Big Ern's was on Valentine's Day. A group of my friends and I hit the downtown scene that day and Big Ern's was our pre-game stop and our dinner for the night. We got there at around 7-8pm and it was pretty busy. We were a group of 6 and sat outside along the playground. I ordered a combo platter: Brisket, mac n cheese, and potato salad with a PBR. The prices are very reasonable. The service was fast and the staff members were humble. The brisket was tender, sides were tasty too. If you're going downtown this is one of the restaurants I would suggest you to eat at."}
{"text":"Not great. Just okay. Was hoping for better, but I'm sure it's limited in the location."}
{"text":"Delicious! Pulled pork and brisket are great - sometimes they run out of certain sides. This has happened twice when I've gone."}
{"text":"Arrive 30 minutes prior to closing to be told they are not serving food for the evening. I'm sorry the last time I checked if an establishment has such rules and regulations they should be posted. First impressions are everything and that was a pretty bad one. Won't be returning to give it a try."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, as I have had BBQ all over the country. I ordered the ribs, Mac n cheese, hit link and salad. The salad was good greens but the Italian dressing ruined this salad, the dressing was disgusting. To the ribs, the were dry and sauce was soso. The service was mediocre and drinks were small. This place needs to step it up, Bug Ern needs to try his food. I asked my gf and two out if towners, \"do you think Big Earn would be happy paying for this meal? No was the answer. I hope he steps it up."}
{"text":"Nothing too notable here. Besides the size of potatoes. Prepped ahead (I don't know how far ahead), reheated food. Generous portion. Bit pricy for what you get, but your in DTLV. So that's that."}
{"text":"Its ok.   Been here twice.  I think the food is ok little dry the pork needs more BBQ sauce.  The lady behind the counter is not to friendly I asked her for a refill she seemed bothered.  They should take yr order outside because while waiting inside it gets very claustrophobic. The space is to small to conduct a line."}
{"text":"Not the best bbq i have had. It wasn't gross but it also wasn't the best. That is just speaking of the sauce. The meat was dry and tough. I think it might have been a few days old. The servings are pretty large. I got the 3 proteins with the slaw. The slaw was pretty decent. Not too bad at all. The meal was $18. I does come with a roll so that's good. The environment is pretty awesome because it's located inside the container park."}
{"text":"This place is great. I wish they would franchise and come to cleveland. We had a really awesome meal and for only $24.00."}
{"text":"I come to Big Erns probably twice a week because I live downtown. I even recommend this place and I often bring family and friends here. If I chose to stay in, I will usually order my favorites through postmates. Today, I decided to stop in before heading back to my office and received the absolute worst customer service in the 7 months of coming here. I saw new faces today, perhaps that was reasoning for subpar service. 

I noticed that their menu changed to a bright collage of poorly written letters from their previous printed menu. But noticed a few new things, like the chocolate raspberry bundt cake! Looked amazing. Wished I had tried it. I ordered my usual Brisket and Fries. The brisket loaded potato is also my favorite! But Brisket and fries. Oh and the cashier talked me into the cake. So I'm waiting for about 5 mins or so and the manager comes over to tell me that someone forgot to turn on the fry machine this morning (it's 12:30p right now) and he can't make fries. Kinda bummed out because they have decent seasoned fries. Don't get me wrong. I love the food. Not always consistent unless Gary and the lovely Hispanic cashier (forgot your name, I'm sorry) are working and that's when it seems like everything is quick and tastes like BBQ should taste!

So I tell the manager I don't really want anything other than fries and asked for maybe a lil more meat. He couldn't do that. I understood and was like I guess I'll just get a refund. The cashier who initially appeared warm and friendly says \"dude it's over fries!\" Not the point lady... it's 2 hours after opening during lunch hours on a Wednesday and you don't know your equipment isn't on? Just give me my money back. There's a heated exchange where she was reminded that I'm a paying customer, paying for a service that you are supposed to deliver, when you fail to meet those simple expectations I am well within my right to request to have my money returned for services undelivered. It is not your place to question my food choices or berate me with why you're selling fries and I'm purchasing them. Remember that. 

The manager, still very pleasant, urges this uncontrollable child to stop talking and she proves to be even more hostile while arguing about my refund not to mention insubordinate to what seemed to be a reasonable manager. She argues with me about not being able to give me a receipt showing that my credit card was refunded. Again manager steps in and does his job, not so effective but he tried. After she shoves the receipt at me, I've had it and decided that it's just best to never visit this establishment again and Start walking out. She again proves her lack of decorum and professionalism as should boldly protests that I should leave. Cute... I'm already walking out the door.  

Unfortunate to have lost my continuos patronage. Food is pretty decent. Almost Southern. Reminded me of home in North Carolina, now for more than just the food, unfortunately"}
{"text":"Brisket and pulled pork was good. Great customer service. Cute BBQ spot. We will be back."}
{"text":"It was ok for tourist-quality BBQ. Staff was friendly and service was quick. I was here on a Sunday night, so maybe not as much attention was put into cooking as during other times. Got the three meat combo - brisket, ribs and hot links. Nothing particularly stood out about the flavors but it was a lot of food."}
{"text":"Went early on a saturday morning. Staff was nice, Owner was a very nice laid back guy. Food was good and flavorful. Plus it doesn't hurt having PBR on tap."}
{"text":"Tried 1/2lb brisket asked for fatty and i got lean was dry and more like roast beef, sauce was good and put on the side. Didnt try any sides just the brisket which was disappointing. Claimed to be best bbq in vegas. There is limited seating inside and the patio is small. The location is downtown not best location but inside new container park w security out front. They use a southern pride smoker gas just fyi"}
{"text":"Well, it's in the CONTAINER park. So, like every store there, it's on the smaller side of things. I can see seating being a problem during the evenings and colder months, but anytime it's 60+ outside, the outdoor seating is more than adequate. I imagine the size also keeps the menu items at a minimum. 

Walking in you're hit with that signature smoked bbq scent, which should be sold as a candle scent bc I want to be around it at all times. 'Pork' by Calvin Klein. 'Burnt Ends' by Yankee Candle. Sign me up! The menu isn't large, but covers most of the bases. Pulled pork, chicken, brisket, ribs n hot links with a number of sides. Seeing as they were pulling meat from a freshly smoked pork shoulder as I walked in, I opted for the pulled pork sandwich with a side of slaw and a Fat Tire. Total came to $15. The meal ended up being great! The pulled pork was moist and had a hint of that smokey goodness. The accompanying bbq sawse was good and gets you through any of the larger, drier portions of the meat. I wish there was a spicy version though. There were two bottles sauce to choose from , so maybe there is, but they weren't labeled, so maybe there isn't. Who knows?! The slaw was solid too. Large chunks of cabbage and more of a vinegar base than a mayo drowning, which is always appreciated. 

While I'm going to eat my way around the park before I head back to try more of the menu, I will be back 100%. Any bbq fan that understands the limits of a restaurant in a container park is sure to be satisfied from the offerings of Big Ern."}
{"text":"This place is located in container park not so far from the entrance. Parking is easy on the side street next to the park. The restaurant has limited seating inside but plenty outside.

The food was good, as much as you'd expect. It hits the spot. My roll was slightly stale but my husband said his was fine so maybe a fluke. 

We had the brisket, mac and cheese, and bbq chili. Everything was tasty. The Mac and cheese wasn't the best but I've paid for much worse. I only wish they had more sauce choices. 

Decor was the usual faux shack bbq place feel. So it's fine unless you're snobby. 

If you check in they'll give you a free side too, so not a bad deal."}
{"text":"Stopped here last week with a coworker and had a great time.I ordered the Pulled Pork dinner. The food tasted great and the service was great. Overall it was a nice relaxing dinner on a beautiful night. We ate outside and soaked up the scene at Container Park. 

I paid around $12 for my entree and a drink, which is very fair for Vegas. If you're looking for a quick meal and good BBQ, I recommend Big Ern's."}
{"text":"It was a decent lunch spot. Went there with my mother, and boyfriend for a quick bite to eat. When we ordered my boyfriend ordered the brisket and sweet potato fries, was told there was no brisket, then ordered the pulled pork and was told there was no sweet potato fries. Settled for the regular French fries. I ordered two spare ribs with Mac and cheese for my mother and I. We paid and took a seat outside and was approached by the cook, about four minutes after placing our order, to tell us there was no Mac and cheese and had a choice between, fries, chili, or beans. 

For a restaurant that didn't really have much to offer us this afternoon, it was decent food. The service was pretty fast. I would come by to try it again, to see if the experience would get better and if their options got wider."}
{"text":"Overall it was 'ok'. 

I love bbq and this place has a lot of potential.  The meat is a little dry, but has decent flavor and their sauce is quite good.  Portions are pretty large as well.  We tried the Mac & Cheese, Potato Salad, & BBQ Beans, all of which were fairly bland.  Also, their bread for the sandwiches and rolls is very dry.  

Being that the restaurant is at the Container Park and you can sit outside with your beer & bbq on a nice day, I really enjoyed the ambiance. 

If they would improve their food, this place could really be great.  They have the basics, now they just need to spice it up!"}
{"text":"Not everyone can perfect a brisket, but big Ern has accomplished a tender brisket. The mac is also yummy."}
{"text":"Great BBQ ! Great family friendly environment. The pictures look good but the actual BBQ is even better .Located in the Container Park there is seating on  the stores porch or right next to the tree house. I have visited several times during the weekend and also during the afternoon and the store has always been clean and staff very friendly.

The 3 meat plate is good if you want to get an idea of what the menu offers. I have had the ribs(only 3 come with any of the plates),half chicken and pulled pork with macaroni and potato salad. Everything was cooked to perfection. The meats were all tender and I felt had the right amount of BBQ sauce. The potato salad is my favorite. The macaroni feels more stove top to me, I'm a baked macaroni type. However my little ones like it. My daughter says, \"it's cheesy, thumbs up.\" The portions are very generous; the three meat plate definitely can feed two adults. On a different occasion I ordered the full rack of ribs. It's our favorite of everything on the menu. Definitely worth the money !

The kids love the chicken tenders with fries. The chicken tenders are huge and they give out a lot if fries. The kids were not really a fan of the fries. I think it's because they prefer wedges or standard fries. I brought a friend with me the last time and her daughter wasn't a fan of the fries either. They did however like the sweet potato fries ( go figure).  The free refills on the kids drinks is also a plus.

If you are looking for great BBQ this is the spot. I will definitely make it a point to visit again."}
{"text":"Just what I needed delicious 5oz of meat a side and a dinner roll for  $10.00. How do you go wrong. 
Very happy I stopped in."}
{"text":"Really good BBQ but no in restaurant seating if you are expecting that. We wanted to sit outside. The food phenomenal and we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Really good barbeque food.  Really casual atmosphere, you order at the counter and they have it ready pretty quickly.  Customer service wasn't on point, but everyone has a bad day, so don't let it stop you.  The portions are good and you can pick your own seat.  Would do it again anytime I'm nearby."}
{"text":"Outstanding BBQ restaurant in the heart of Downtown Las Vegas. I received great service, outstanding brisket sandwich and good potato salad. Next time I'd like to try the Mac and cheese. Great value for your money and great location inside Container Park."}
{"text":"I like this spot, it's a calmer place to go when you want to escape the crazy of Las Vegas, especially down the Fremont end of town. 

The BBQ was tasty and the staff were friendly but the little customer service things were missed, like having to go fetch your own condiments and silverware. Maybe it was a bit late and it was close to closing time? 

The patio is a great place to sit and watch the world go by, great spot for families."}
{"text":"Oh my BBQ Gods.   So yummy!. Had a brisket sandwich and the best I've had in town!.  The environment is very pleasing also!.  Enjoy!."}
{"text":"Me and my son were in town for his hockey tournament this past January. We came to downtown Fremont, and after doing reviews we decided to eat here because it sounded the best. We got our food, which consisted of beef brisket, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw, mini corn dogs and french fries. We tasted everything and it was amazing! And my son is a very picky eater and he loved it! And the people who run this place were also very friendly and polite. Not only with the customers but with each other as well. Usually you hear people ordering other employees around but not here. They asked, said please and thank you. They were all smiles and just so happy. And the atmosphere was very relaxing. Whenever we come back to Las Vegas we will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"After walking the container park for awhile my wife and I decided the smell and line at Big Erns must be because it was so good.we were wrong! I have to believe the good reviews must be from people that have not been exposed to GOOD BBQ. I ordered the three meat special and my wife ordered the meat salad. The three meat plate was good in size with two sides, Mac and cheese and Cole slaw . My three meats were three pork ribs, pulled pork and brisket, a good sampling of what they had to offer. To start the meat was cold, the brisket was cut with the grain and each piece was very dry. I like to use the sauce to accent the bbq but here I needed it to just swallow. Needless to say this made all the meat very tough. Only positive was there was a good smoke ring in each meat. The sides were awful, the cole slaw lacked any flavor and spice, my wife commented it was like eating cabbage and water. The Mac and cheese was very grainy and lacking any really cheesy goodness, I took a picture to explain the comment. My wife's salad was fair with low quality ingredients, canned black olives, bad lettuce and some shaved carrots and dry meat. Considering the mid to high cost this was a very poor food experience."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork sandwich which was actually really good.  The sauce will hook you, but I did not think the hot sauce was really spicy.  I found myself dipping my sandwich not because the meat was  dry but like I said, because the sauce was tasty.

Portion size for the sandwich was decent, not too small, but not too much either.  Price for the meal was a little pricy for the amount served.

Staff could put a smile on as it made the atmosphere seem somewhat bland.

Overall good food just need some pep in the staff."}
{"text":"I never imagined that a BBQ brisket sandwich could be so greasy!  I mean, it was disgusting!!  Where does the grease come from, I wonder?  
I am a local and I won't be recommending, nor taking anybody to Big Ern's ever."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a long while & it was my coworkers birthday & he really wanted to try it out.

We were happy to have come back.

Located inside the now famous, Container Park, if BBQ is what your looking for, than this is the place.

It was a perfect day, the nice wind with the Las Vegas sun at a nice cool temperature made a wonderful background to our birthday boy lunch.

The staff is super friendly, the menu has  been revamped & the prices are comparable to the rest of Fremont East.

From the brisket, wings, pulled pork, the red beans & rice (you have to try it - so good!), spicy links, sweet potato fries & Mac and cheese (whew!), you won't be disappointed.

We were a group of six foodies & we sampled each other's plates & we all spoke the same words, \"Yum!\"

It was a great experience and I hope to come back & revisit the experience all over again!

Thanks for the good grub!"}
{"text":"One star since they close at 1, but they close the kitchen before 12:30. If the kitchen closes before 1 then you should change your hours of operation. I really wanted barbecue dammit."}
{"text":"By far the WORST BBQ I've ever had. The ribs were extremely dry, the coleslaw was tasteless and watery and the French fries were garbage. The most irritating part, I paid $32.00 for a half rack and fries. How the hell do places like these STAY in business?? If you want BBQ you should definitely consider going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I just ordered 3 pounds of their beef brisket!! It is so good!! Melt in your mouth, tender, AND super juicy... 
I won't be ordering my brisket from ANYWHERE else, ANY TIME soon."}
{"text":"I never really write reviews but in this case I have to be fair and do the right thing 
I want this company to really take pride in there food and do better I really loved you guys even sent you clients your way. I waited all week for you all to have your app up and running was told over the phone last week that you all would be up and running on there Monday,. Because the last time order it was some of the best smoked bbq beef brisket I had in a long time and I wanted your food again. What the hell happened?!!!!!!
I don't know if they were having an off day or who ever was in charge of cooking they need to season the food.
I'm very upset and appalled. I have ordered from here numerous  times and this will be my last order ever.

Today I ordered through DoorDash my driver gets there and calls me to tell me that, the company refused to give them my food because they no longer dealt with DoorDash, okay that's fine but since my paid for and received order went  through ,  they should've given the food anyway. Then they should've called DoorDash to tell them to close there deliver app for them.  

Red flag right there that shows you what kind of Integrity they don't posses  or at least whoever rejected my order in the first place. So afterward I call DoorDash to get them to get my order delivered. They got them to deliver Okay, Yes they honored the deliver  after I called but they didn't include a Im sorry Courtesy dessert or anything for me having to wait longer for doordash to resent a driver out to redeliver my order and rejecting my order In the first place .

 I should've followed my first thoughts and order from some other BBQ place. The food is all baked at least mine was baked  and don't even get me started on the Mac and cheese . I hate when a company cuts corners and bakes there meat and then says it BBQ . Get the hell out of here with that BS!! I I can see them BBQ the food and then the last 10 minutes baking it to ensure it super tender. Plus the food had Absolutely   no salt whatsoever and hardly no BBQ sauce on my food. What I got was a small drizzles of sauce over food.

I'm not one to add addition salt to my food very often. I hate to have to leave a harsh review but I'm pissed off!! Paid good money for a 1b of beef brisket and a bbq rib meal only to wish I had not ordered at all.
You all really need to season your food better and actually smoke/grill the food."}
{"text":"First visit to the Container Park and I was surprised. I didn't even feel like I was downtown (except when I was walking in or leaving) but once inside it was really fantastic. The BBQ was tender and not dry. The sauce was pretty good. The potato salad was a bit bland but all in all a nice BBQ lunch in a pretty cool setting. Think I'll bring the family down one day to try it all again."}
{"text":"They almost deserve 4 stars. I wish I could do a 3.75 stars on here. I had them for the 1st time tonight. I ordered a 2 meat combo w/links and brisket to share with my woman. We both wanted beans since they didn't have mac & cheese. 
The brisket was very good!! Good crust. Tender. Smoked well. Could taste the smoke thru the BBQ sauce. The links were good too. Good snap on the skin. A nice lil spice to um. The baked beans were awesome!! Loved the pulled pork in the beans. And they weren't too sweet.
But I expected more food. I would've gave um at least 4 stars, but I expected a little more food for $12. The cashier seen me & my chic were going to share a combo and she didn't even try to upsell us to a 3 meat combo. And I still wish I had more meat as I'm posting this review.
Overall, Big Ern's is a little more meat away from being my 2nd favorite BBQ spot in Vegas. But the food was exceptionally good!"}
{"text":"I have a favorite BBQ place in town, so Big Ern's can't have my whole heart. However, they are right around the corner from me and it's cozy inside, the staff was so friendly they won me over immediately. I can be a shy solo diner so I really appreciate friendliness. My hot links were really tasty and I liked the brisket... have to remember to ask for no sauce, next time... I'm not much of a saucy girl. I really liked the coleslaw, too, it had a celery salt thing going on that I very much appreciated. But an extra star just for making me very comfortable. Great job guys, I'll be back plenty."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this Friday after work. By the time I got there (10:30) they were out of all the meats except the pulled pork and hot links, but I like both so I went with the 2-meat combo. The hot links were great, and the pulled pork was tasty. The only bummer was the sides: the baked beans with pulled pork had big chucks of raw onion in them (maybe I'm in the minority here, but I hate raw onion), and the mac n cheese was no bueno. 

I will say this: the service was excellent, and the sauce is very good. I'm probably going to post a follow-up review once I can try the other meats."}
{"text":"Great food amd great service from cashiers and the server, very polite and fast! Would definitely recommend this to anyone whos is visiting vegas.."}
{"text":"I don't understand how you come across town to eat at a BBQ restaurant and they have a sign up that they are out of predominately all their meat. FAIL!"}
{"text":"The staff is incredible! Had a lot of fun with them from the moment i walked in. I ordered a lot of food, and boy was i satisfied! Had fried okra and pickles as sides, plus a bunch of bbq meats. My kid is not super picky, but he's still a kid. We all loved everything. Great vibe. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been here several times.  Tonight, though, was way below standard food.  Dry meat, tasted old as if cooked days earlier.  Ambience and friendly staff were up to normal par - thus not a lower rating."}
{"text":"We came to Fremont for a family dinner and came across this restaurant it looks inviting because of the child friendly playground right across the street we proceeded to order our order was very prompt and came very fast we later discovered that the Looks was an allusion because the food came out plan and not pleasing it seemed as though our food was leftovers for days before however since we paid for we had to make due"}
{"text":"Ok was expecting some great bbq.......and was not disappointed, but the quantity left me a little sad. 4 slices of beef brisket, a roll and 2 sam adams....$21.
I need more bang for my buck."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.... Food took forever to get as they have 1 person working the \"food\" line, a lady taking orders, and another shredding pork.  Finally got our food, only to be cold. My salad did not have dressing, we ordered cheese on our baked potato (only thing hot) and didn't get. For the price, bad service, and cold food I don't think we will be back. Food did have good taste."}
{"text":"I had the brisket and hot links. Brisket was a little dry but the seasoning and smokiness was good. Coleslaw wasn't traditional, but it was fresh and probably the best part of the meal. However, the \"mac n cheese\" is the WORST I've ever had. It's dried up, uncheesy, and flavorless. I can't believe they serve it."}
{"text":"Brisket was so tender and delicious. Chicken was so tender and lean. Beans were flavorful and just enough kick. Coleslaw was different... Had black pepper in it and it throws off the sweet complexion of the sauce.

There's beer! Need I say more?

My only complaint is that there isn't enough sides. There's like five and one is chips (I've already named three of them)."}
{"text":"Waited over 20 minutes, tried giving us the wrong order. Cook threw the wrong order in the trash. Turned around and started cooking again, no apology. We waited another 15 min while behind us are now getting their food. I politely asked the man behind the register an update on our food. I even started with \"I know you guys are under staffed and very busy...\". He gave me a refund which then I explained to him that I didn't want a refund, I just wanted to know what was going on with my food. He gave us a refund, we took, he offered to make us our food still, free of charge. Our time was up, we had to go. An apology would have been nice."}
{"text":"Have had BBQ all over the country; this is not literally the best ever, but it is that exceedingly rare find of a bbq joint with pretty good meat AND sides that are not hideous! Was not expecting this in a touristy spot. Nice little area, with the play park and shops. Would come back for sure."}
{"text":"I was really craving bbq ribs this place isn't what I expected it to be.....but It's inside a casino so what can I say? I got the ribs plate which was $9.00 the ribs are excellent & it comes with a side & I ordered the mac n cheese I was really dissapointed with the mac n chz it taste bland & flavor less  & it comes with 1 roll. 
Overall food was good my boyfriend & I both ate for under $20.00 but I like my food really hot & it was slightly warm I don't like that.
Good food
Decent price"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with my brisquet at this place.  It's in the container park.  I was there and saw it and had to try it.  I had brisquet and it was tender and moist with good smoke flavor.  The sauces we're flavorful too.  The cornbread and beans we're both like momma made.  If you are in the park and have a need for bbq give it a try.  I would stop in again.  $12 for a meal isn't bad."}
{"text":"The Brisket sandwich was really good. Located at Container Park, a casual setting, a nice find."}
{"text":"I like this place lots,very tasty bbq I had the beef brisket and ribs combo brisket was nice and juicy and the ribs were nice and tender and packed with flavor,I'm actually going back today and bringing the wife with me.:-)"}
{"text":"I ordered my food and waited 20 minutes only to be told they were out of pork for my 2 Bbq sandwiches.  I took a refund but had already given them a cash tip.  Not a good experience."}
{"text":"Friendly Staff, Good Music and Great Food
I had the Brisket with 2 Ribs, the meat was perfect. I had Coleslaw and Collard Greens, everything had good flavor, I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Pretty decent pulled BBQ chicken sandwich. A little dry, but the extra BBQ sauce station kinda makes up for that ( kinda). Will be trying the brisked the next time I come. I have to see if it stands up to Rollin Smokes BBQ brisket..."}
{"text":"How many times have I bemoaned the lack of good barbeque in Las Vegas? 

Why is it so hard to find good barbeque here? Oh, that's right - most barbeque places are JUST PLAIN LAZY!

I understand barbecue takes time, hours and hours in fact. But as long as there are places in this world like Franklin Barbecue in Austin, TX, where Mr. Franklin smokes his brisket for 16 hours before serving, not one single place in this town is going to get a break with their \"how do I get this done quickly?\" methods.

Now listen, I really like Big Ern. I have met the man and he is a genuinely nice man. I will honestly say that I think he does put a lot of heart into his cooking. His barbeque is pretty good, and I have stopped in on several occasions. 

I will say that when it comes to barbeque, Big Ern is kicking everybody's but here in Vegas. I love you for that Big Ern - I really do, but your just not there yet. 

As for the rest of you barbeque wannabees in Vegas - pack up and go home, before I step it up and show you all what real barbeque tastes like."}
{"text":"So unfortunate! Today was my 1st visit to the container park. My husband, 3 boys and I visited in the early afternoon. We chose to eat at Big Ern's BBQ. If it weren't for the HORRIBLE attitude of some of the staff, I wouldn't even be commenting. My husband saw an employee behind the food line DOUBLE DIP HER EATING SPOON IN THE PUBLIC MAC AND CHEESE. After my husband said something they removed the macaroni in question.  The employee that was taking my order even suggested that the trash be checked for  another spoon. That sounded reasonable. There could've been a chance that she was not double dipping into public food.  No second spoon was produced!  We didn't expect to eat for free or anything of that sort. We just wanted to feel like our patronage was important and that this issue would be dealt with swiftly and properly. Their treatment of us that followed is what affected my rating of them. A few employees stood behind the food line stealing glances at our family and shaking their heads. 

My husband doesnt like confrontation so for him to say something, the incident had to be really bad. A Big Ern BBQ employee that hadn't been present for the incident asked if everything was ok. My husband walked over and told him exactly what happened; That he watched an employee dip a plastic spoon into the macaroni and cheese that was being served to the public, ate off of that spoon and instead of throwing that spoon away and getting another plastic spoon she dug the SAME spoon that was just IN HER MOUTH, into the macaroni and cheese and took another bite. The lady that was running the cash register walked over to my husband and started yelling at him that the situation was over. That they took the food off of the line and that was that. The employee that did the double dipping said my husband was lying. 

Never have we felt so disrespected and unappreciated! It really is a shame. The  macaroni and cheese was delicious. It rivaled my mom's homemade macaroni. To bad all of that was overshadowed by the  blatant disregard for proper customer service and disgusting food service standards."}
{"text":"Just cuz i love bbq pork so much. I would definitely recommend this place to eat late night with the friends. I would love to try some other items from the menu"}
{"text":"Where do I even start -__-
I mean, I wanna laugh just thinking about writing this review.

The BF and I weren't hungry but, decided to just try it since we were already at Container Park. 

Once we entered the place, the girl at the counter told us that they were out of all the meats, except the sausage links...which is funny because that's the one meat I didn't wanna try lol

Regardless, we went with it - sausage links sandwich and baked beans (for me) and mac and cheese (for him). The girl was nice enough to give us the extra side for free!

We got the sandwich first and once we opened our plate lunch, we had cut up sausage links and bread. 
Literally! 
No sandwich in sight.
I looked at my BF, then the menu, and was like: \"I thought this was a sandwich?????!\"
Let it be known that the sausage links were tasty.

Then we get our side of baked beans and mac and cheese in cups. CUPS! The kinda cups that they prolly use for their complimentary waters. 
The baked beans were so hot that my cup started to melt at the bottom and completely disfigured. I couldn't stop laughing about it!
Baked beans weren't anything to rave about...nothing sweet or caramelized. Tasted like it was from a can, to be honest. 
The mac and cheese was penne pasta with soupy sauce.

Overall, disappointing experience. Only saving grace and only reason I didn't give it 1 star was the great service and personalities of those behind the counter.

****** This place just opened so I'm sure they have ALOT of glitches to figure out. Most def has a lot of potential. 


Local small businesses are what Container Park is all about, after all."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ for Nevada.... Meats are very good & the sides are fantastic - recommend the potato salad, fried okra & beans. Good prices & good food!"}
{"text":"I like the concept. A small menu of southern BBQ, quite possibly my favorite food genre. However, it wasn't all that great. My ribs seemed to start out well, but as I went through they became more and more covered with fat. I know that may appeal to some, but not to me.

I had the coleslaw, which wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. You can get fried okra here, though, and even though I didn't have it, it sounded like it was good from the reports of others.

You order by the number of meats you want, and then add your sides. Simple and effective process.

Very tiny place, so keep that in mind if you're looking to dine in."}
{"text":"Great chicken, ribs, brisket and beer always worth a trip back in a great location also"}
{"text":"Meh.  

We had the wings/fries, rib tips, slaw, beer, lemonade ($29 +tip).

Tips were ok...overcooked but moist.  Bland.  Nothing exciting.

Wings were old and over seasoned.

Tasted very much like reheated BBQ.

Slaw tasted bland.  Maybe mass produced?

Fries were bland with blasts of their house seasoning....which isn't that great.

Overall, I've have and made better BBQ.  Their house seasoning is really a weak blend of spices...so everything tastes the same and needs a LOT of sauce."}
{"text":"Bring your appetite!  They have good size portions and a good selection.  Nothing to fancy but that's what you need at a BBQ joint.  Their pulled pork and beans are great!"}
{"text":"I had the loaded baked potato and it was horrible! The potato was not completely cooked, so it was hard. The pulled pork on top of the baked potato was dry and hard and had no flavor, not even with the horrible tasting bar-b-que sauce that was on it. If the baked potato was this bad, I can only imagine what the rest of their food tastes like. I will never eat here again, once was enough for me!"}
{"text":"OMG! BATMAN! This place rocks! The ribs are outrageously amazing! I don't care for the sides, but crazy thing is who eats BBQ for the side dishes? It's about the meat people!
Place is tiny, hello it's in a container.. It was super clean, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. This is a great place to bring friends and hang out and people watch. The beer was yummy as well. So get in here what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Would definitely recommend. Great food and fast service. Love this BBQ place. Got hit link sandwich with fries and both were warm when arrived. Not to bad on price either."}
{"text":"A great joint in the new Container Park, part of the urban movement going on in Fremont East.  Besides, how many of your friends can say they've eaten lunch in an old shipping container?

Ribs are solid, tender, juicy, flavorful, and not tough.  Brisket needs to make up its mind if it's gonna be lean or fatty.  Would prefer the latter.

Slaw is odd in that it's a vinaigrette  base as opposed to most creamy slaws you see.

2-meat combo was plenty, and nice at around $12.  Quite full from it.  

Best of luck to Ern and Crew, and the rest of the joints in the Container Park."}
{"text":"Average BBQ - smelled great walking up but the taste was minimal on smokiness. Brisket was cut with the grain and both plates were fatty. Ribs & chicken were good. Tried all the sides... Coleslaw was the best. Beans were bland, and the Mac and cheese needed BBQ sauce for flavor. Hot link was good, and the bun served with meal was pointless filler.... The park had a great feel and transcended even being in Vegas... Pork & beans will get my business next time I'm over there."}
{"text":"Run of the mill BBQ joint in the Container Park. Staff is friendly, yet attention to detail is lacking. Prices are on the high side."}
{"text":"It seems as though this is the most popular spot to eat at Container Park. There is usually a line of at least 3 to 4 people and can go long enough to be out the door. I ordered brisket with slaw and beans. The menu is very minimal, but that's fine with me because more is less right? My sides were okay, but unfortunately not good enough for me to order the same sides again the next time I come. My brisket was good, but a little dry and needed more flavor. So I definitely added more sauce to it. I think the food deserves 3 stars but the ambiance and service constitutes the overall 4 star rating. Although the inside seating area is rather small, I still like the country vibe of the place.  The price is also pretty reasonable and eating a meal at Container Park seems like the thing to do when you're there. I will definitely give them another shot, since the other meat options on the menu sound/look good."}
{"text":"Fantabulous beef brisket!!  Tender, flavorful, sauce was a perfect blend of seasonings, and a half pound for $8!  Staff was a little short on product knowledge, but tried their best. 

Honestly, that's all we tried since my girlfriend had a craving, and I wanted to try the lobster grilled cheese next door.  Will definitely return for more."}
{"text":"Big Ern greeted us in person and gave us a tour of the menu. We ordered 3 kids meals and a 2 meat plate. Kids finished their food which is hard to do for our kids because they are super picky. I got the chicken and links with a side of BBQ beans and green salad. Meat was tasty and the BBQ beans were super good. We ate inside and when all finished Big Ern pulled out a bucket of toys and gave all the kids a toy. We love supporting MA an PA shops since we own one as well. Keep up the great work Ern!"}
{"text":"Just OK. Ribs weren't very good. Brisket was tender and pretty good with maybe just a little more fat than reasonably expected. Potato salad wasn't very good but mac and cheese was decent.

Friendly service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had from a restaurant in a long time. I got the pulled pork with some mac n cheese. A classic, but Big Ern's makes it the best. Customer service was on point with Anthony D. being extremely friendly and conversational. It was like being at a family cookout, I'll be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Very small place but cute and quaint. I like the surrounding area as well container park. There was not a long wait on food and it came out fresh tasting and hot. They provide very friendly service. I had the brisket sandwich and it was amazing. There was nine of us in my party and all though The place was pretty small we were able to squeeze in. Everybody enjoyed their food with the exception of one person but I think it was that she was trying something she hadn't tried before and it might not be her cup of tea. Overall I would love to come back to this spot and spend more time at container park."}
{"text":"We strolled Fremont Street and happily welcomed the little oasis of Container Park! We were all hungry and came upon Big Erns BBQ. Small (I mean come on you're in a container!) Quaint, clean and the friendliest staff. From bread to brisket to mac and cheese and pulled pork all four of our meals were excellent. We'd definitely do it again if in town. Prices were also a nice relief from the highway robbery of Vegas pricing."}
{"text":"The bbq was pretty good.   Ribs were great.   Didn't care for the side dishes though.   The mac and cheese was a bit tasteless and the slaw was really different.   More of an Italian dressing slaw.  
They could get some more authentic recipes for the sides and they would do better."}
{"text":"Granted I came here on a busy day but no need to be rude or have a snappy attitude.  I was at container park for my race packet pick up and ordered a brisket & pork and 6 rib bones with a beer and wine.  Hefty price but it was good eating.  Really good rib bones might I add!   

But when I went up to ask about our missing rolls I got the biggest attitude in the world and they were sure it was on our plates and can't do anything about it.  I was like wow, okay.  Not the biggest loss and I wasn't going to hold up a line stretched out the door.  Good food, but horrible under business pressure.  I'd come again"}
{"text":"An honest 3 1/2 stars.

I really wanted to like Big Ern's BBQ more.  It's good, but only comes out to average for me when compared to other BBQ.  And we all are biased when it comes to BBQ because we all have different tastes.  Some love smoke, some love spice, some love sauce, some love tomato-based, some love mustard-based, and some love vinegar-based.  Hell, some folks even love BOILED ribs!  Just as a note people, boiled meats are NOT BBQ.

This was our meal when we visited Downtown Container Park.  It looked interesting because when we where there, this place had the longest line.  Figure the food must be the best around, right?  Well, yes and no.  It is arguably one of the best places to eat within the park.  But for BBQ it's not my favorite.  But still good for what it is.

We had the two item combo platter of pulled pork and hot link.  The platter came with a roll, and two sides.  Most popular items leaving the kitchen that day were the mac & cheese, and the baked beans.  We ended up trying those.  We also picked up an extra hot link sandwich to try.

Verdict?  As I said before, good but not great.  The pulled pork was a bit on the dry side and was light on flavor, but good on smoke.  The sides were OK - the mac & cheese was yummy but needed a bit more cheese.  The baked beans were decent, not overly sweet and I think there may have been bits of pork in it.

The star of the show was the hot link.  These I liked very much!  Spicy, good flavor, and good texture.  They had a great chew when you bit in to one, nice snap.  Delicious on the hot link sandwich.  Their BBQ sauce isn't bad either, tomato-based, it appeals to those who like a sweeter sauce.  Slather this all over your hot link sandwich and it was good eats.

Reason why it's down a 1/2 star is the darn pricing.  Whoa, I get it, everything in Downtown Container Park is pricey!  I mean for $12 on a two item combo platter I was expecting a bit more food.  It's good for one person, a bit difficult for two to share.  The sandwiches are $7 each but don't come with a side.  It will cost you $2 more to add that on.  Adding on a soft drink will tack on another $2.  Don't go to Big Ern's BBQ expecting a cheap meal!  But then again don't go to Downtown Container Park and expect anything on the cheap."}
{"text":"Average BBQ spot located inside Downtown Container Park. Been here twice.

Brisket is flavorful and not loaded up with salt or sauces like some of the other spots around town.

The hot links were a little dried up but the chicken and pulled pork was pretty good.

No complaints on the beans or coleslaw, but the only \"potatular\" items available were bagged chips. 

Be prepared to spend a little more money as this place is not cheap.

Overall service was excellent."}
{"text":"I've had the beef brisket here a couple times now and it's tender and delicious! Add to that the Mac and cheese side I ordered and the dinner roll and it's a solid deal for around $10. You can add different meats for $5 more and they have a few options to choose from - both meats and sides. 

It's located right in container park and the service is pretty quick. Nice lunch spot with outdoor seating and a few spots inside (It's in a shipping container). Overall a solid place that I've been to a few times now."}
{"text":"BBQ in a container!

Another cool restaurant located in the downtown Las Vegas Container Park. When walking into the Park it is a short stroll off to the right hand side on the main level.

I've been here a few times while visiting the container park with family and friends. The ribs, Mac n cheese are my usual but I've been told the brisket isn't so bad. 

The BBQ here overall is not  to bad, it isn't the best in town, but not bad for the location and general access to hearty meal. They also offer a few beers on tap which is a nice touch to wash down your BBQ. Like all the container park restaurants they use the biodegradable silverware and plates which is a nice touch.

Usually I have found a lot of the times coming here, it can be a painfully long line and once you have your meal, the seating area is quite limited in the actual container. Outside seating is is also offered but usually takin up by someone watching the main jungle gym.

Overall 
Service: 3-5
Cleanliness: 4-5
Food: 3-5
Back again: Yup, but because of the container park"}
{"text":"Good pulled pork. The bbq beans were ok. I wish they had more sides. The prices were fair.  Small seating area inside. We ate outside and enjoyed the nice weather. We would go again if we're in the area."}
{"text":"I dub Big Ern's the first place I've grubbed at in the Container Park. Pricing is a little steep but considering the tastiness of the food, I'll accept it. The place is extremely small, perhaps fitting around 10 or less people in the seating area.  There are seats out on the patio, but it was about 40 degrees outside when I went.

The girl who rang me up kept on looking at me like she was annoyed with what I was ordering. I was glad I was wearing sunglasses because we could've had a terrible stare-down competition. 

Besides the service being weird or rude--or whatever you would categorize it as--I had a lovely BBQ chicken sandwich. The chicken was a little on the dry-side, but I looooved the bbq sauce that came on it. I am usually a hater of bbq sauces because they usually over power my taste buds. But this sauce actually complimented the chicken well.  

The only critique of the sandwich was that the bun was cold and it would have been TOTALLY awesome if it was warm and toasted. But hey, what can I do?

My dude got the two meat combo with sausage and brisket. He said he liked it. So I snuck a piece of his brisket and it was indeed tasty but a little dry. 

Overall the experience was underwhelming. I won't NOT come back, because I think the sauce they use is fantastic. However, I don't see myself as a frequenter."}
{"text":"Let me say this first I only got to try 1/2 lb of brisket at Big Ern's today but I am looking foward to my next stop in here. I would have ordered more but this was my second BBQ stop in an hour and was not expecting to cross paths with the place. 

I ordered 1/2 lb of brisket I did ask for it to be .25 moist and .25 lean. I didn't get that but what I did get was the best brisket I have had in Vegas. I seemed to only get the brisket from the moist cut. No lean was to be found on my plate. As well the 1st plate came out with sauce. Yikes such a no no. They replaced it and we go from there. The 1st taste was really good. I have had better else where but not in Vegas. I will say am not sure they are trimming the briskets correctly though. Even though the taste is there and the smoke ring. It was lacking a great bark and it had a lot of fat the should have been trimmed. With my knowlegde of brisket I am pretty sure this was not trimmed down enough. Either that or the smoker they are using is not rendering down the fat enough. I will be back and look foward to trying more things at Big Ern's. Maybe even bump this up to a 4 on a rereview.

Didn't want to do complete update. It is staying a 3 lack of bark and to much fat. Best brisket in Vegas but that is not hard to do. For the ribs they are really good prob the best I have had in Vegas as well. The side, well just stay away from them. The mac is dry and lacks everything and the bbq beans well just wasn't a fan. 

Just make sure to order without sauce or they will cover it."}
{"text":"Well this place has a lot of potential but sadly doesn't come very close to it. The food looks delicious, the BBQ is tasty, but the bun was kind of soggy, the Mac & Cheese, Baked Beans & Potato salad looked great, but had really no taste, pretty much just bland. With a little effort it could be a lot better! The pulled pork from the sandwich, the beef brisket and the shredded chicken were great with just the BBQ sauce. They have some decent outdoor seating across from the kids play area. 
BTW: great place for kids!! but don't come after a 5k cause its crazy busy!!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best bbq in Las Vegas. The staff is very friendly. I had the kid's side pork slider with fries and mac&cheese. It was a good lunch size meal. Mac&cheese needed a little salt but bbq was on point."}
{"text":"The briskets in the place was absolutely perfect! It was my first time in Big Erm's BBQ and boy id say I die and went to heaven. Briskets were moist and delicious with a hit of BBQ sauce. The big potato was very good along as a side. I'll definitely come back a few more times."}
{"text":"Good good had the 2 meat. Brisket and ribs , sweet potato fries and Mac n cheese. Everything was really good. They also have beers in tap and bottle. I had the hard roor beer was really good with the bbq."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE FOOD, they have changed the quality to poor from great.
New limited menu with poor quality meats  fatty brisket an burnt ribs. 
Was a favorite bbq place before,
I will never go back terrible quality pure fat. 
I had 6 or 7 great meals here until it changed food completely.
They will not be in business long. 
Good bye Erns BBQ 
You killed yourself. What a shame
You used to amaze me with the best smoked meats with no fat. 
Now you are the worst.
SUCKED HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT"}
{"text":"OMG good brisket an beans. So very good. Cant wait to go back. Big portions an small prices. Love Love tip get the combo not the sandwich. The meat is different."}
{"text":"Showed up at 10pm when their Open sign was still up, and personnel were visible through the windows, and they were supposed to be open until 11pm. Door was locked and personnel right next to it and couldn't be bothered with even so much acknowledgement as, \"hey, sorry we had to close early.\""}
{"text":"An update: I emailed the business with my comments. Ernie, the owner emailed me back directly, apologized for the discrepancy and disappointment and said he would have container park's website amended. He explained that it was something they did for their opening and that the website hadn't been revised since that time but he was taking care of it. The fact that the owner took time to address my concern was awesome! That kind of customer service is rare in Vegas and it is very much appreciated."}
{"text":"Meh. I really wanted to like this more since it's close to my work, and I love BBQ in general. I also don't want to drop 15 bucks on lunch too often, so I opted for a brisket sandwich and drink....which still came out to 12-13 dollars.

For that price? Not worth it. The sandwich and coleslaw were mediocre. The brisket was just lumps of meat in a little bit of sauce, there was nothing else on the sandwich. It wasn't too flavorful, and it also wasn't much food. I can't justify spending that amount of coin on something that doesn't taste amazing, and doesn't even fill me up. 

I was hoping the 3.5 rating was wrong and it was better than the average suggested, but for my experience it was not."}
{"text":"It was okay. Food was really good but for the price I don't believe it was worth it. 
Boyfriend and I ordered pulled pork plate and brisket. It seemed like portions I would feed to a child not an adult and especially not for almost $30. The atmosphere was nice and considering it was in Container Park I'm not super upset about it. I just won't make a habit of going unless I'm not that hungry and have extra money to burn"}
{"text":"Was excited to try a recommended Bar B Q  spot. But very disappointed, the ribs were dried out, burnt and very cheewy. When in Container Park try a different eatery. The container was also very warm and provided no relief from the heat outside."}
{"text":"How does a bbq place run out of food? Tonight's visit they were out of fried okra, mac n cheese, potato salad, and sweet tea....like really? Also, their bbq beans are very bland with no taste. For that they stuck! If you want good bbq go to John Mulls."}
{"text":"While i was checking out the container park the aroma of barbecue immediately caught my attention.  The restaurant has a banner in the front stating ,\"2014 Best BBQ in Las Vegas\" but that must've been self-proclaimed.

The menu is a bit confusing and the choices seem really limited which work for some places but definitely not here.

Food:  I got the ribs because lets face it, bbq = ribs.  Plus if you're going to endorse your restaurant as the best bbq in las vegas you better have some great sauce and tender juicy meat to go along with it.... NOPE!  The meat was dried throughout the rib and I was chewing on it like a piece of beef jerky.  The potato salad tasted like the ones you buy from Albertsons but spoiled.  The pork and beans weren't too bad but really that's not going to bring me back here.

Overall: This place has the dryest, most flavorless ribs i've ever had... I love barbecue and have had my share of barbecue all around and this is the absolute worst.  Don't let the aroma fool you, do not eat here!"}
{"text":"Word of advice, if you have a problem with acid indigestion, don't be dumb like me and get the spicey sauce.  Let me say, it rocked my world until 4am, and then it really rocked my world in more ways than one!  
The prices were great, the 2 guys that worked there were incredible host's.  I had the brisket sandwich.  The meat was really tender..  
Being this is at container park, there is not much room in the container to eat.  5 tables and it was a bit packed"}
{"text":"Had ribs dry rub, very good, liked it as much as any carolina bbq restaurants.  Wife had yhe loaded potato, which she loved."}
{"text":"Yumm yumm yumm, besser gehts nicht. Bestellt den Brisket mit Sweet Potatoes Pommes und ihr werdet mir für diesen Tipp dankbar sein. Das Mac&Cheese ist auch nicht schlecht, selbstgemacht, aber die Sweet Potatoes waren einfach unvergesslich. Die Mitarbeiter sind sehr nett und sind für jeden Spaß zu haben. Es gibt auch ein Yelp Angebot, wo man gratis einen Side bekommt, jedoch Wlan ist so schwach, dass man sich nicht mal einchecken kann. Schade"}
{"text":"It was just ok. I wouldn't go back again. Pricing was decent although $2 bucks for a 8oz fountain drink and no refills was rediculous. The night we were there they we're out of mac & cheese, bread pudding and potato salad, all BBQ place staples so how could one run out? My pulled pork sandwich was ok. Meat was tasty but dry. I had to drench it in the sauce they had out to use to get it down. Sweet potato fries were yummy and the piece of ribs I ate from my friends plate was well over cooked. Decor was cute but the tables were not clean and the lady at the counter definitely wasn't friendly. 3 stars is probably an over rating but I don't want to be an ass and who knows maybe they were just having a bad night. I'm not going back again to find out though."}
{"text":"The service was good don't get me wrong but just the food was not the best well the bbq was okay but the sweet potato fries were gross the Mac and cheese was bland and had a strange after taste that was left in your mouth for hours it just wasn't what I expected, this is more of a fast food type of bbq which I have never seen and would never try again"}
{"text":"The aroma of BBQ lured us in when we were trying to choose a lunch spot at Container Park. The girls behind the counter when we ordered were friendly and our food didn't take too long. For a restaurant at Container Park they had quite a few tables for diners. 

My husband and I split a meal since we were planning to try some other food spots in the area afterwards. We decided on the two rib and pulled pork combination with collard greens and potato salad. I liked the flavor of the ribs, but it wasn't as tender as most BBQ. The pulled pork was also good with BBQ sauce. I guess the theme of the meat was good, but not mind blowing. The collard greens were tasty and had a kick to them. They were definitely a unique twist on the typical collard greens. The potato salad was great, my husband and I agreed that we really liked this side. The roll on the side was boring and being from the south my husband commented that he wished they had gone with cornbread. 

The price was very reasonable for BBQ and the service was good. We liked our food, but wouldn't go as far as to say it's the best BBQ in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't like to give places negative reviews, but we were really dissatisfied with the ribs, brisket and pulled pork. My son is a major carnivore and I was surprised to see him stop eating and call it \"bland\". The staff is very nice -- but the food really isn't even average. I had high expectations because of their location, but the food just didn't measure up. It's sad to say, but the hot dog place just around the corner was much better when we ate there the day before. They clearly aren't phoning it in, that's why I was so surprised when the food wasn't any better than Arby's. How is that possible?"}
{"text":"My goodness!! Love this place!! Great BBQ salad dressing, potato salad and BBQ pulled pork!! A must try!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to check out Container Park on Wednesday, August 19th. It was during the dinner hour and since I really like bbq, we decided to eat at Big Ern's BBQ. My wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich and I ordered the combo plate of brisket, pulled pork with beans and slaw. We sat inside and the young man brought me a plate with brisket and the two sides. I told him that I ordered the pork as well. He checked the receipt and gave me the pulled pork. My wife tasted the pork and since it was extremely dry, she went over to the guy and asked him to change hers to a pulled chicken sandwich. He had not started her sandwich yet and said it was ok to change it. He helped someone else before he made her sandwich. The service was terrible. All of the food should have been brought to the table at the same time. That was the least of the problem. The pulled pork and the brisket were very dry! The slaw and the beans were average. The chicken sandwich and the sauce were just average. I threw almost all of my food in the wastebasket. I do not like to waste food but it was really bad. Dried out food should not be served. It was the worst bbq that I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"A lot of potential lost in the details...

Came here last Saturday night and the line was out the door. Took about 30 mins place an order, which was fine by me, because Container Park is just a cool place to be and people watch. 

We ordered a pulled pork sandwich, order of BBQ, potato salad,mac and cheese, and pork and beans. Unfortunately, by the time we sat down the BBQ was cold. I found it to be dry and bland. I do honestly think if we had eaten it right away, it would've been better. Hopefully, I'll have a chance and revise this review.

Potato salad was good (made with olives) and not chunky. Mac and cheese was really odd. I believe it was made with real cheese so it was oily instead of creamy. Just a different style I suppose, but I didn't really care for it. 

The pork and beans were out of this world! Being from North Carolina, I can't say I've had better back home!

I do plan on coming back here, because I see the potential in the food. It's straight forward with fresh ingredients, but they were so packed on the night we were there, I just think the preparation was a bit over looked."}
{"text":"Great bbq. The essentials are great: spicy hot links, brisket is moist and flavorful, Mac n cheese is pretty close to perfect. Not a legit restaurant, about 10-tables, like the Container park location. Perfect for take-out. Staff were friendly and helpful, cook came out to greet us and ask how the food was. Negatives: corn muffins were small (about quarter-sized), rolls were dry, and no lemons for sweet tea."}
{"text":"Love this location, every time I'm at Container Park, I eat here. 
Hot Links:  C+ little too spicy, dry and gamey.
Brisket: B+
Ribs: B+
Mac n Cheese:  A+
Pulled Pork:  A-"}
{"text":"Well eat here at your own risk! I have been here several times and will never come here again. Food made me sick. I have had Outstanding BBQ all over the World including the Church of the Holy BBQ is Texas. The Container Park is great and some of the shops are Outstanding! However, this place is Bad News!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but honestly over priced.
We got the brisket meal and a chicken meal. You get 3 pieces of thinly cut brisket, 2 small (I mean small!) Sides...for $10 ($9 and some change) I was very, very disappointed. The brisket was so dry too. The BBQ sauce was nothing to write home about.
Oh, and $3.95 for a solo cup size of PBR!!! I know it's Container Park, oooo big tourism, but $4 for A PBR!!
Again, so disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Quick trip to Big Ern's. Loved the decor and inspiring messages. The space was cute but a little cramped. Thank god we happened to visit when it was not quite busy. Although I felt rushed to order even though no one else was on line however the service was pretty quick.

I ordered the kids a pulled pork sandwich meal and myself just a beer. The kid's meal cost $5.95 each and the portions were miniscule. I usually have to beg them to finish their meal but after eating at Big Ern's, the kids kept asking for more. They said the sandwich was good but I think they were just starving. Honestly, I was going broke trying to fill them up at this place. I'll come back for a casual beer but not to eat."}
{"text":"Big Erns BBQ! What can I say? What a beautiful little gem this was to stumble upon.

Hidden at the east end of Fremont street in the downtown container park this is the best BBQ I have found in Vegas!

Its a small little place with seating in and out for about 30 total. The staff, a couple of cool cats inside were happy and fun and very informative. Remarkably clean for a BBQ place.

I had three meat plate, ribs, brisket, pulled pork. Perfectly smoked melt in your mouth Q, sauce on the side as good Q should have. Excellent slaw! 

If your in Vegas, A block east of Fremont look for the stacked shipping containers and go get your Big Erns on. You wont be sorry!"}
{"text":"Been to many BBQ places in North Carolina.  Nothing compares to the tenderness of the Ribs, Rib Tips and Brisket.  Chilli is Amazing! And if you're lucky enough to find Bernice on her shift, you'll probably have the best BBQ experience of your life!"}
{"text":"Stopped by the container park so my 3 year old could have a blast on the awesome Tree house and play yard for kids they have. Building blocks and over sized legos. Super fun and the adults can hangout and have a cocktail or beer as well. 

Parking is pretty convenient on side of park as well as lots across the street. $2 per hour i paid for metered parking. Dont forget to slip it on the dash before entering.

There are tons of shops, eateries and bars for your taste. We decided on Big Erns for a quick bite. 

Meal of choice:
Kids Meal - 2 piece chicken tender with fries (these tenders were huge btw)
Pulled pork sandwich w/ a choice of side: potato salad was my choice and 2 soft drinks. $18 total and added a tip:)

Service was great, gentlemen assisting was really friendly and even brought the food outside for us.

Overall the kids good was huge my 3 year ate a third of it as they do most of the time. Big enough to share for 2 toddlers. And the pulled pork was just good not great, I think i liked the salad more then the sandwich. I will be back again to bring my husband and maybe try a platter next time."}
{"text":"This place deserves a solid 4/5! I don't know why it only has a 3/5. 

Mom and I brought my son for a free kids event yesterday and this was the perfect place to grab a bite to eat! We went in right at noon and managed to get a table inside so we could cool off in the AC. Don't forget to check in so you can get a free side with purchase! We opted for the garden salad with brisket and a side of sweet potato fries. The salad was pretty basic (romaine, purple onion, green bell pepper, shredded cheddar, tomatoes, olives and croutons) and they give you two sizeable portions of dressing. The brisket is served chopped and delicious! It was very tender and had such w great amount of flavor - it didn't need a drop of sauce! As for the fries, it's a pretty huge serving! Definitely enough for two or three people to share! They're thick cut and on the soft side, but taste oh-so-good! 

This will definitely be our go-to when we're spending an afternoon at the Container Park!"}
{"text":"Wow, disappointed to say the least. Is pulled pork supposed to be served cold? If so, I've been eating it wrong. We just dumped it and walked out. Not even worth complaining about.  You have one job, to serve me hot food. The tiny restaurant was empty and they made us get up to get the food. The cook couldn't walk 10 steps, no surprise that heating the food would require too much effort."}
{"text":"Big Erns  has Good sweet tea (hard to find sweet tea in Vegas). That being said the  pulled pork not bad, bun was too hard to eat, potato salad was bland and potatoes were crunchy. Best part of meal was Sweet Tea."}
{"text":"Great staff and service.  I really like the BBQ.  The combo platters let you try up to 3 different items.  I also really love the coleslaw!  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love the bbq here. The brisket is my favorite. The Mac n cheese is homemade not from a box. I've tried various, meats here and all the meat is soft and tender. So yummy. You can sit inside or outside. The staff is friendly. The only thing I would change is to level out the wobbly tables. But that doesn't really have anything to do with the awesome food, it would just make the experience better."}
{"text":"Sauce is good. Mac and cheese SUPER good!! Chili really good! Brisket a lil bland but with sauce good."}
{"text":"Literally the best bbq in town daaaamn!! The ribs are juicy they hook it up it's like being down south"}
{"text":"This place is extremely disappointing.  Ordered the brisket with 2 ribs to eat the driest, hard, overcooked, charred meats ever.  Nothing was juicy and for the first time in my LIFE, I didn't finish my BBQ.  I hate writing bad reviews but man I have no choice here."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ in town! Great meats and it's always fast pickup for lunch on the go for downtown workers. Or hang around and drink a ($4!!) beer or two. The pulled pork is my fav, ask for extra sauce. The BBQ Pork+Baked Beans a hit too!"}
{"text":"My family and I experienced tasty BBQ at Big Ern's while walking about Downtown LV. We ordered the pulled pork sandwiches, coleslaw, and fried okra. All of it was super. Thanks, y'all!!"}
{"text":"Awe man !!!I was hoping for some good  bbq brisket ,, but after ordering , big erns was a big disappointment.  I have eatten some very good bbq from Kentucky and this was not even close. The brisket itself was full of fat and not even melted down. Not to say a good brisket has to have so much fat but should be melted off a bit.. Most of the meat was fatty. the sauce was just ok . The meat was a bit salty. Now lets get to the sides.The chicken wings were salty . The mac and cheese was old . Not saucy but lumpy. Not my idea of good mac and cheese. The okra was good and probably the best part of the meal. The lemonade was from the fountain. If i went 2 doors down there was fresh sqeezed lemonade. My bad. Worse of all the french fries were soggy and burnt at the same time. One employee told the Boss  the iodized salt may be the problem but it fell on deft ears. Not even a blink. The good was the BBQ sauce was better than average. Okra was good.
The bad was everything else"}
{"text":"YUM! My coworkers and I go here for lunch often and it never disappoints. I always get the meat salad with chicken. The salad is super fresh and delicious. The only thing missing on the menu is french fries!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer at BE. But seems like they keep making portions smaller and smaller. The tall blonde man has always been on the lower end of the order but this time he managed not only put too little meat but also the the worst bits and pieces, opposite to the general belief that to keep your business successful overdo rather than do what is expected, and of course rather than do less than expected."}
{"text":"Anytime I go down to Container Park I have to stop in. The food is delicious! Last time I went down there, I was lucky enough to get to meet Big Ern himself. Super friendly guy and was genuinely pleased that we enjoyed ourselves. I snagged a bottle of their BBQ sauce as well, highly suggested!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Their kitchen is filthy. I'm not impressed and they also ran out of condiments. For the amount we spent I expected better quality."}
{"text":"I could've made the chicken nothing BBQ about it except some sauce. Brisket was dry and borderline old. Coleslaw was OK. Beans are Ok. Don't ever need to eat here again. I love the stores in container park but what about some real good eats??"}
{"text":"I had friends in from town and I took them to the Container Park as part of the downtown experience.  We purchases a rack of ribs from Big Erns and they were awesome!  The service was friendly and quick and Marian M. was very accommodating with all of her suggestions.  I recommend Big Erns to the world.  The full rack was $25.00 and it fed four people nicely, we were just a little hungry and they were perfect.  The tables outside the joint were nice and clean as well.  

Thanks Big Erns!"}
{"text":"Well yesterday I took my coworkers to \"the perch\" which was a total let down (long wait for food etc) so today they didn't let me pick lunch (they don't trust my judgement after the perch fiasco). Josh picked big Erls based on the yummy smell of BBQ wafting out the door. Once inside we knew we were in the right place, nice and cozy and full of yummy smells. The lady taking our order up front was really nice and made me feel happy. Food was delivered fast, and on time, by a friendly gentleman with an impressive beard and and flowing pony tail!  
I asked Josh how the bread was, he shrugged his shoulders and said.... it's ok id rather have corn bread. I asked Luke how the Mac N Cheese was, he said.... mmm pretty good! Josh like the pulled pork, and Kyle said the ribs were decent, he said they fell right off the bone (thats a good thing). Josh liked the beans. Everyone was happy!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ in the Container Park. My toddler's fav go-to snack when we are playing there is the mac n cheese!!"}
{"text":"decent little pop up bbq joint here located on 7th at Fremont. part of the LV downtown project here. they got some pretty good pulled pork sandwich here. it's opened for lunch only. n make sure u find somewhere with shade to sit in!! =]"}
{"text":"Great bbq brisket and pulled pork. Priced right with good service. Don't get here too late because of its popularity, sometimes they run out of food. Nice problem right?"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Mac N cheese is spectacular, pork chili awesone and the cashier Hollie was polite N funny....thanks Hollie!!!! Definitely trying the brisket next time. Per her recommendation.... she's  great at walking me through the menu items and making suggestions!! Local love!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Container Park to explore the food.  The food was tepid and cooled quickly.  We ordered pulled pork which was stone cold by the time we sat down by the park to eat. The hot link was was cold as well. The mac n cheese was stuck together and tasteless.  Tasteless plain white roll accompanies the meal.The highlight of the meal was the pork and beans. It smelled great , looked clean, staff efficiently took our order. The food was a complete disappointment."}
{"text":"Omg!!! I've been missing out on this gem at Container Park! All the years I've been going to the Park, Big Ern's was always super packed and I dislike waiting for food so I have frequented the other eateries in the park. This past weekend, Hubby bought us tickets to Wines Around The World happening at the park this past weekend. Heat and alcohol tends to provide a faster buzz so we needed to eat. It was early so Big Ern's wasn't crowed yet so we decided to try it. First, the music was my kind of jams! Old school R&B and I was singing, snapping fingers and grooving! Hubby and I both got hot links! YUM!!! The Mac & Cheese was similar to mine and Hubby went back and ordered sliced brisket which was DELISH!!! We will definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"It's been forever since I've had excellent BBQ!! On my first experience at Container Park we ate at Big Ern's.

They have a very full menu offering all the classic meat and sides. They have brisket, chicken, ribs, pulled pork, and hot links. My husband and I decided to split the 2 meat and 2 side combo and chose brisket and hot links for our meat and the mac & cheese and potato salad for our sides. Let me tell you, I wanted to shove him out of the way and totally not share. It was that good! The brisket was perfectly cooked and so tender. The hot links had just the right amount of kick to them. The spice was flavorful and not overpowering.They also had a perfect blend to their BBQ sauce; not to spicy, not to sweet. Loved it! The sides were ok, but I would try their BBQ beans and maybe the coleslaw next time. The potato salad looked more like mashed potatoes and lacked flavor and the mac & cheese was good just not that great. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't awful by any means, just not fantastic. 

There is limited seating out front and inside, but if you are willing to walk upstairs there are loads of seating and excellent people watching. I would like to go back to Big Ern's and purchase some of their meat by the pound and bring home some messy, messy ribs! If you're in Container Park make sure you hit up this place!"}
{"text":"We were wandering \"old Vegas\" and stumbled onto the container park. This restaurant was very yummy! We had a combo plate with brisket, ribs, and hot links - all were delicious. We also got coleslaw and fries. The coleslaw was okay, but the fries were good. You definitely get a good amount for what you pay for. One star off since the lemonade wasn't real."}
{"text":"It was time for date night and we both settled on this place.  I've known the owner for years and wanted to support his business.  My date wanted to eat BBQ so it was a win win situation.  Located in the Container Park, this place recently opened and was part of the grand opening in this new outdoor center.  

Just like other businesses, this place is located in a reused shipping container.  Inside is super quaint, they use the space well!  The kitchen is stainless steel, colors of red and white trimmings seem to work well!  The menu is displayed on the front wall with wooden panels stacked on a red background.  You literally order your food, grad your utensils and condiments on the other side and have a seat.  There's inside and outside seating.  Inside, you have wooden tables, as well as red, white and blue chairs.  Outside seating makes you feel like your sitting on an outdoor porch.  Literally, you are! LOL.  

For dinner, I got the 2 meat comb platter for $11.95.  I chose the Brisket and Chopped Chicken with two sides of cole slaw and BBQ baked beans.  The cole slaw wasn't the best in my opinion.  What seemed like a vinegar based slaw, was actually a watery mayonnaise based slaw.  Too soupy.  The baked beans was the star of the meal!  Super flavorful, sweet, salty with the pork.  It was awesome!  For the meats, the chicken was good.  It didn't have that smoky flavor I was hoping for, but seemed to do well with the BBQ sauce.  The brisket unfortunately was too dry.  You needed the BBQ sauce for it.  I was hoping for more of a marbleized flavor but didn't.  The roll served with my meal almost tasted like cardboard. It was so dry.  I wish they took the time to at least warm it up or toast it.  

I'm definitely going to be back.  I support all of our downtown business and certainly wish the best for Ernie and his business. I hope my next trip will change my mind on my overall ratings.  For now, it was just ok.  Good luck to them in their future endeavors!"}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time with friends. The lady taking our order was EXTREMELY rude to us! She should not be working in the front! We were all so shocked by the way we were treated, it was hard to enjoy our lunch. Pulled pork sandwich was good, but will not be going back because of the horrible attitude this lady had."}
{"text":"Some Vegas locals I was visiting wanted to show me around Fremont Street this past Saturday night while I was in town and decided that going to the Container Park for our (very late) dinner would be the best so that we'd have choices and not all have to get the same thing.

I love all things meat (if you have read my reviews, you know this) and BBQ is an absolute favorite of mine, especially brisket.

What do I like more than brisket?

Macaroni and cheese!

So I was pretty darn excited over this dinner. It took a little longer to get than I expected, but maybe it just felt like we were waiting forever. Our friends were able to walk over to the hot dog place in Container Park, order their dogs, and walk back over before we'd gotten ours, and there hadn't been other people in line ordering before us. Luckily, I wasn't ravenous or anything so the wait wasn't bad.

At first glance, because my eyes are often bigger than my stomach, the three slices of brisket didn't look like much, but it was plenty and I didn't quite finish. If I had, I may have needed to be carried to the car.

The meat itself was super tender and melt in your mouth. It so easily came apart, there was no need for even a plastic knife. The fat came off really easily which is important to me as someone who really hates chewing fatty bits with the meat. The meat itself was unfortunately kind of salty, which is really noticeable to me (and was to my friend as well, who got the pulled pork and ribs - I tried his pulled pork and it was DELISH).

The BBQ sauce was good, if a little bit strong in both the sweet and tangy departments. It's hard for me to find a restaurant BBQ sauce I really like, but I hold out hope. This sauce reminded me of the one I've had at Phil's BBQ in San Diego - people go gaga over that stuff but the sweet plus the little hint of sour bite means that halfway through the meal, my tongue starts to get a little sore like I've been pounding sour candies.

The macaroni and cheese was definitely my favorite part. A lot of BBQ places serve rather dry mac and cheese, but I like mine drenched in creamy, oozy cheese sauce. This wasn't super oozy, but it was creamy and cheesy, rich and comforting. The little styrofoam cup's worth was unassuming but plenty!

Overall, it was a perfectly fine late-night meal for a Saturday of walking around Fremont. If I found myself back at Container Park, I'd probably eat here again but get the pulled pork. Or maybe just a ton of macaroni and cheese on its own!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch. The brisket was fatty and Mac and cheese was very bland. The pork was better but have definitely had better.  Would go back if in a pinch, but there is much better bbq out there."}
{"text":"Ate there last night and found a hair cooked into my bland pulled pork sandwich. When I told the staff, they said the owner would have to talk to me before I could get a refund. Also, they told us they were out of Mac n' cheese and they proceeded to serve it to people right behind us. Not sure why homeboy wouldn't just give me Mac n' cheese..."}
{"text":"Ive been smelling this W since they began construction on Container Park.   Food truck.  Well after all this time i went.   To keep it sort.  Service awesome. Those two fellas should teach classes on customer service.  brisket beyond awesome.  Hotlinks so good.  Sides maybe a work in progress.   Go you will enjoy."}
{"text":"This was my first time and I will absolutely return. The pulled pork and Mac N cheese was delicious. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Fabulous bbq. What a find. New to Las Vegas and terrific."}
{"text":"First time and got the wrong impression. I went with friends and our kids,.I already ate at home so I order for my kid a pulled pork sandwich and fries from the kids menu and after I paid I overheard the waiter complaining that I order from the kids menu. Not coming back, I felt that was very rude."}
{"text":"I came to here once before and it didnt disappoint

Came here cause we have a friend visiting and once again outstanding big portions  for the price the only draw back is the one size for drinks but atleast theres refills.....always tasty"}
{"text":"Inside container park, the atmosphere and the seating on Deck is really nice, You go in and order your food and the wait is very short. The food is not that great, the barbeque sauce is not that good and the meat is dry. The food smells great but tastes dry"}
{"text":"I don't know why Big Ern's isn't feeling as much love as I had for him last night. I ordered a plate of brisket and pork with cole slaw, roll and a bag of chips. They have PBR and Fat Tire on tap. I was more than happy to see Fat Tire. PBR must be for the lost hipsters that stumbled out of the Fremont Experience. Someone please put a barricade up.

Now onto the food! The brisket was fork tender because I wasn't given a knife but it was tender enough I really didn't need a knife. Saving the environment one tender brisket piece at a time.

The pulled pork was tender but the star was really the brisket. It had a nice smoke ring and plenty of smokiness. I also liked that they didn't kill it with sauce and let the meat speak for itself. 

The hubs finished off the cole slaw. My five year old stole my chips. The roll was meh, but I was happy with the quantity and quality of the brisket. 

Immediately after I ordered I noticed they have rib tips, this is on my to do list for next time."}
{"text":"Just tried Ern's for the second time and it was again delicious! Tried the pulled pork this time and with an ice cold lemonade it totally hit the spot. Great place for a quick, but satisfying lunch."}
{"text":"Was there today and it was awful.  I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich, took a bite and literally spit it out, it was fatty and gristly, so gross.  I ordered my nephew a kid's meal and the chicken was cold and the small bin was cold and hard!"}
{"text":"Second time here, first time was great the whole family ate it wasn't terribly expensive bc their kids meals are like $5. The servings are huuge! I had the Mac n cheese and a pulled pork sandwich the hubs and I also split some fries. Their fries are sooo yum and crunchy, the rolls are bomb  so soft.

This last time I bought a kids pulled pork with fries and added a side of Mac n cheese - and I got a roll. I love their rolls!! Probably will be ordering a ton for thanksgiving. Anywhoo got all that for like $9 

We'll be back for sure.
Five stars for bomb food, friendly service, and good prices."}
{"text":"In for a few days from St. Louis. We wanted BBQ and was told this is the best around. It was definitely worth the Lyft drive and walk from Union Station. Meat just fell off the bones and tasted great. Only bad thing is  the location is hard to find with Google due to it being in the container area."}
{"text":"First time in the Container Park and we stumbled across this place, great little find. The Brisket sandwich is easily the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"This place has really good brisket. The dinner combo comes with 4 thin slices of meat as well as a side. It also comes with a small dinner roll if you want it. The price is what kills me and makes me not want to come here often as you don't get as meat for the $10 you pay. If it was like $6-7 it would be a good deal. 

The dining area is pretty small inside but why eat inside when it's nice outside with all the lights. 

If you like bbq you should come have a try."}
{"text":"Great food and great people- Ern makes the best BBQ- truly spicy and cooked perfect."}
{"text":"Big, delicious, BBQ! Low prices and hearty portions. Cozy little BBQ shack but the location is excellent. The restaurant is in the middle of the Container Park outdoor mall near Fremont Street in downtown Vegas. Pulled pork and ribs was my choice and it was 5star. Check it out, I recommend for Travelers and Locals."}
{"text":"Brisket sandwich was like a beef jerky sandwich. Coleslaw was decent. Unless your a da and ur drunk avoid."}
{"text":"The food is good but the employees are very unfriendly.  There was only one there that was nice.  It's really too bad because it's located in the Container Park and the businesses are not doing well."}
{"text":"My experience was horrendous. Everyone we encountered at The Container Park was so friendly, except here. The staff was very unfriendly and cold. The cashier seemed annoyed by everyone. I ordered the Half Chicken plate, a side of Mac and cheese, a side of potato salad (which I used my free side available on Yelp), and a water. The food came out very promptly, but I never got my water. When I asked for it, the cashier gave me attitude about it as though I never ordered it. Now the food: the chicken was dry. The Mac and cheese was obviously cooked awhile ago because it was crumbly, not cheesy, and the melted cheese on top of it was hard. Sadly, the potato salad was the best thing. The roll that is served with the meal was rock hard. Everyone in my party complained that their food was not fresh. I wish I could get my money back."}
{"text":"There was a hair in my beans....I let it go because the person I was with was loving his meal.  This restaurant doesn't have restaurant facilities which is tacky to me....it;s like they are saying don't wash your hands before eating.  

I had rib tips and they were dry.  The potato salad was good at first bite then you could taste a STRONG celery taste, not good.  And like I said, the beans had a hair.  The bbq sauce was good, at least."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant located within a container park while visiting Fremont Street. Great location in the park as it sits across from an enclosed play area for the littles. Not a huge restaurant but there are a few tables outside and more inside where you can enjoy the AC and music (not a live band). Staff was friendly, food was quite tasty and we even ended up buying some bottled BBQ sauce to enjoy at home. Highly recommend the potato salad. The beans were a little too greasy for me but they had no problem exchanging it for a different side. Thank you for a fun family dining experience!"}
{"text":"I had to wait 15 minutes for a cup of mac & cheese. All he had to do was scoop it out. Not coming back ever."}
{"text":"This place is a gem located in Container Park. It is tiny, but offers some nice outdoor seating as well. I've only ever had the ribs here, and I am okay with that! The ribs are fall off the bone tender and paired perfectly with a nice cold beer!"}
{"text":"Came in on Sat night. Dirty napkins and plates on all the tables and the floor. Kitchen area floor was littered with crumbs and napkins.

I ordered a few items and each time I ordered something the cashier had to ask the cook \"did we run out of that\".

I ate the half chicken. Chicken was good but BBQ was just sauce dumped ontop of it.

Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This review is for the Fiesta rancho location. I am not seeing it listed as a location on Yelp as of this review.

I tried the brisket combo which comes with two sides along with a bread roll. The sides I chose were Jambalaya and the Collard Greens. As for the sides the greens were fantastic although very salty with a lot of juice at the bottom of the cup.. I personally like my greens like this, although many people would find it salty almost like a soup broth. The Jambalaya was honestly some of the most bland that I have ever tried and lacked anything that makes a good jambalaya good. The most important piece of the meal is the brisket which was served to me not in slices but rather in chunks.. Sort of like tuna fish..it was not melt in your mouth and honestly tasted much like cheap roast beef that would placed in like a soup or on some beef stroganoff. Absolutely one of the worst brisket dishes I have had from a BBQ restaurant. The bread was just a cheap dinner roll and nothing homemade. I will say that the hot bbq sauce is very good and probably my favorite condiment sauce I may have ever tried. Don't know if it's homemade or something like Sweet Baby Rey's or slaking those lines.
My wife tried the loaded Potato Bomb and while it was 10 bucks.. I will say that the potato was huge and filled with toppings. I am not a potato fan but she said she loved it. Looked pretty impressive in size. 

Overall if you are in the Las Vegas valley and are looking for great BBQ, go to either SNS DINER OR JOHN MULLS. make sure your put BIG ERN's at the bottom of the list."}
{"text":"This place is in the Container Park not far from Freemont Street. They have a little bit of seating inside but it was a sunny and warm day so we sat outside. As for the  food, I'm from the South originally so I'll admit I'm picky about BBQ  The brisket was excellent and had a smoky flavor, a little bit of char, and was so tender I was able to cut it with just a fork. While the meat was excellent, the sides are very much hit or miss. They didn't have fried okra which was a bit disappointing. The BBQ beans were excellent with a strong garlic/onion flavor that is unique and enjoyable. The mac and cheese was just okay and while tasty it was VERY oily. 

Overall, I enjoyed my meal here and would return but remember the meat is the star here and the sides are just okay for the most part."}
{"text":"I travel a lot, i've had lots of BBQ.  I'm picky about my BBQ.  This place is right up there, one of the best I've tried.  Next time we come to Vegas we're stopping here for some food for sure.  Got the pulled pork, great portions and flavor.  Keep it up, Big Ern!"}
{"text":"It is sad to say that this place has gone to hog heaven! No more catfish to make my nature rise, no more deliverance music playing in my head... Gone... So sad! You guys have to try Maddy's paddy at poker palace!"}
{"text":"We ordered pulled chicken, brisket, baked beans, coleslaw, and mac & cheese.  All of food was pretty bland and the brisket was dry."}
{"text":"Big Ern's serves delicious BBQ. They have the holy trinity of barbequed meats: chicken, pork and beef brisket. All are amazing. 

And their sides are elevated classics of coleslaw, mac n' cheese and BBQ baked beans. Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo. Perfect downtown spot for lunch. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Where's the BEEF??? 
At Big ern's thats where! I had the brisket sandwich with side of mac and cheese for about $11 bucks. The pricing was a bit more than I like to pay for, but I understand... its how it is downtown for a reason. But enough about the cost.

Mac and cheese- I heard was good, but the one I had was not that tasty. 
Brisket- flavorful and a good portion by the way

When I tried the brisket with some of there sauce it gave it that extra kick that I like when eating bbq. I feel though that I could have had a better side. I left feeling like I missed out on a good side, but at least im willing to say this place may get a second visit from me."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Staff is awesome, whenever I would come to downtown I looked forward to eating at Big Ern's(before container park) now I work downtown and he's in a cool place too! Love it"}
{"text":"Big Ern's is legit! This is the second time we've been to the container park and Big Ern's. It's totally great BBQ, the cole slaw is fantastic, it's easy and not complicated! The container park is a chill get away from the craziness! Good job!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. After waiting for a long time, I went back to the counter and asked the cashier if maybe they called our name and we didn't hear it. It was not busy at all, so I highly doubted it. She asked the cook about our order and he took his time finishing washing a pan before looking for my ticket and when he couldn't find it, asked me if I had a receipt. The cashier stepped in and showed him something and then turned to me and said \"He's making your food now\". 
I'm irritated, but whatever, mistakes happen. I asked the cashier for a free side for making us wait for so long and the cook said no. He said the ticket just didn't print....as if that's not the restaurant's mistake. Then he asked me where we had been sitting and said he couldn't see us on the patio. I asked what difference that made if he didn't make or call out our order anyway. Now I'm getting mad because he's being openly rude and acting like any of this is my fault somehow and has not once apologized for the long wait or losing my order. 
I tell the cashier that at this point I'd rather just have my money back because I just want to leave. The cook finally brings over two pitiful looking sandwiches as I'm trying to get a refund and I tell him he can keep them and I just want my money back. The cook of course gives me attitude about that. The cashier claimed she was new, but somehow quickly figured out how to do a refund....My guess is she has a lot of practice at it.
We took our money next door to Bin 702 where we ordered food from a friendly bartender, our order was actually made, the food was great, and we lived happily ever after. 

Customer service is the face of a restaurant and with SO many restaurant options in Las Vegas with friendly, competent staff I see no reason to ever try Big Ern's again."}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch after seeing another customer enjoying his rib combo meal out in the park. the smell of the ribs were mouth watering and he was happily digging in. I enoy a good BBQ at least 3xs a year. so this was our year end meal as it was new years eve, and a new place to try.

The meal was excellent. we got a 2 rib and brisket combo with collard greens and jambalaya, the second plate was pulled pork and hot link combo with Mac n cheese and sweet potato fries. At first my daughter noticed the pork was cold on the outside, but inside was hot, so it must've been sitting while the fries were being made. the ribs were tender and flavorful and so was the brisket, even though it wasn't cut across the grain. The collards had a tad of spice and weren't chopped up as small as the norm,  but had good flavor. The pulled pork and hot link were also good. Sweet potatoes fries were the best I've had. nice and crispy. and the mac n cheese was smothered in cheese which makes it all the more delicious.  The jambalaya was ok, with bits of hot link in it. All in all this meal was great. we almost cleaned the plate, but left bits n pieces. 

I am holding back on the 5th star though. We went at about 1215p on a Friday,  New Years Eve. I'm not sure how crowded this place gets otherwise,  but we didn't have a line when we went in, there were a couple of diners in the establishment which seats maybe 15 max with outside tables as well. unfortunately there was one inconsiderate diner who took up the biggest table in one if the corners that could've sat at east 6. anyway,  shortly after we got our order is when we noticed a line forming. The restaurant is small so it got pretty crowded in there as we were in the other corner dining. I think someone opened the doors so the line could queue outside. That's when I noticed that it was taking some time before you placed your order until you actually got it. it seemed as though we were halfway through our meal before the lady who placed her order right after us finally got hers. I didn't notice how big the kitchen was, or how many  people were back there, but it's BbQ. Most of everything on the menu should already be made, except for the fries and chips. maybe that's what people were ordering?  I couldn't see justification for the long wait for your order. just for that fact, I may be hesitant to go back there, but if I find myself back at the Container park, I may dine there again."}
{"text":"This is the $65 review. Links tender. Spicy in its own way. Part of  Brisket was Magnificient. Practically melts in your mough. Flavorful. Of the pound 3 slices was Horid. Tough. Tough. Tough. Dry. And even sliced with the meats grain lenght. Don't get me wrong. Crossed sliced would'nt help this very much. Two different Cows. Guess one was young adult. The other Cow was 100 years old. So Sad. 60% of Rib Slab was Magnificent. The rest was leaning dry. Must have gotten this rib from TWO Pigs. One was Grandma. Pulled Pork was 3.75+ stars. Honestly the batch might have been cooked yesterday. And reHeated for this evening. With their two type Wonderful BBQ sauces... left overs next day should be OK for sandwhiches. That tough Brisket may need to be Double Chopped for Sandwhiche use. Links should be Yummy as Overnight Treat with some great toasted Bun. Part of the tougher Ribs overnight should be Chewable with some effort.

Some our Dinner was 4.5-5 stars. Some was 1-2 stars.
We ordered no Sides. Based on Yelp Foodies warning.

Total rating. I hate to do this. 3 stars as conservative.
Largely because $10 of the Brisket should not have veen served to Us. Whether cut across the grain or not.


We can't risk going back. $20 part of our $65 purchase was MEH. IF thats OK for Yelpers... Go eat here. If not. Take wisdom from 3 stars Yelp Reviews here.

But then again. On Fremont street one can Blow Multiple $20's in hour or less. Actually so many Eateries here... why not Enjoy $65 on many their Other Offering under the streets Long Light Show. Sad. Are We. It could have been a 5 stars review. And Many Many Many return VISITS.

Damn it. Brisket is Beef. It could have been smoked medium rare and be served Ok. Even reHeated and served and won't be Tough. Why cook it to near well done. Lots Yelp'Rs here posted this. With words like Jerky. Dry.

{"text":"Overall review notes: Don't bother.

There are several choices at the Container Park when it comes to food, we happened to pick this one. The place smelled amazing! The line was forever long, that's a good sign right? ... how could this place only have a 2.5 star rating?!? That's what I kept telling myself as I stood in line for what felt like a lifetime. When the bf got to the counter we realized what was causing the wait. The one, count them one person working the register was a young girl who was seriously either high as a kite or hung over. She was forever slow and had no enthusiasm or urgency to place the order.

Once we placed our order the food came out relatively fast, but it was awful! I can honestly say it's the worst BBQ I've ever had - including my own burnt BBQ at home. It was such a disappointment because it all looked so good!

The Pulled Pork Sandwich ($8.95 with 1 side) - the bun was wet and soggy on the bottom, from i don't know what, probably being frozen at some point. There was almost no BBQ sauce on it, definitely not enough to cover the meat. I didn't even eat the bun, and had only 1/2 of the pork.

The Baked Beans - looked amazing, but were not sweet or smoky at all. I can't put my finger on what they tasted like, cardboard maybe??

The Potato Salad - bland, almost no flavor.

The Mac and Cheese - not creamy, not very cheesy, mostly just tasted like noodles. Bleh.

The BF ordered the 2 meat plate with Beef Brisket and Chicken. his meat had almost no BBQ either. We got extra on the side and had to keep pouring it on. But even the BBQ sauce is just meh. 

Really, just don't bother. It's not worth the time or the money, or the calories. we didn't eat half of any single item."}
{"text":"When I walked in I was going to order a pulled pork sandwich.  Noticed an employee cutting fresh brisket.  He cut a chunk of the burnt end off and disposed of it.  I told him that was a sin.  He asked me if I liked the ends. I said told him that's one of the best parts.   He then took three pieces off the ends other briskets and gave them to me.

The brisket was full of flavor and moist.  I soon forgot about my pulled pork sandwich.  I 
Had the brisket sandwich with Mac and cheese. My friend had the brisket platter and baked beans. Her platter came with 5 nice thick slices of brisket.  It was moist and delicious.    The girl that took our order was smiling and friendly.   It was a good experience."}
{"text":"The ribs at Big Ern's got it 3 stars. The roll that comes with it, the sides, the chicken and pulled pork took away 2. 

to sum it up= those are some good ribs."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, recommending the pulled pork.  The prices are a little on the high side for what you receive but not unreasonable given the area of town and the image of the container park.   The mac and cheese was bland and the potato salad, although mostly potato the way I like it, was also flavorless.  The pulled pork was good and I enjoyed the fact that it was not oversauced and there was extra sauce available but the sauce was tasty but had no wow factor to separate it from other sauces.  The pork itself was very tender.  The star of the plate was the links.  A little kick of spice set them apart from the rest of the food and I wish that was the item I had chosen as my only item.  Will have to try the ribs next time.."}
{"text":"Based on reviews I was a little skeptical about dining here. We were meeting a couple here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and it was pretty busy. I ordered the wings and fries and they were pretty good. My husband ordered the ribs, he said they were OK but cold. I also had the banana pudding it was just ok, a little bland but I still ate it. The side of mac and cheese had a good taste."}
{"text":"best bbq in vegas !!!!the brisket melts in your mouth ! bbq sauce perfect combo of flavors and the chefs in there are always a good time !!!!"}
{"text":"The loaded potato was amazing! And the sweet tea was really good. It had everything on it including brisket yummy goodness."}
{"text":"Dined here twice now, both times for lunch. I like the location being right in Container Park. The restaurant is nothing special but has a nice welcoming porch where in the warm months, one can eat outside. The interior has a couple of tables and booths where you see the traditional red/white checkered table cloths adorning each table. Not a ton of space but ample. The kitchen takes up most of the restaurant in terms of space. 

My friend and I have only ordered the pulled pork sandwich both times and found out to be pretty good. It is served with hot, crispy fries and the sandwich is big piled high with pork. Of course, there is always room for more BBQ sauce which makes it taste even better. The pork itself is moist and tender. 

I am by no means a professional when it comes to BBQ and how it should be cooked, prepared etc, but this place satisfies my craving for BBQ food when I feel the need."}
{"text":"Best bbq in Las Vegas! Our family always makes a point of coming to Big Erns every time we come to Las Vegas. It is a destination by itself. Everything on the menu is good, so you can just close your eyes and point. Slow cooked, tender meat with delicious bbq sauce. This trip I forgot to mention that I wanted a sandwich and they made it right at no charge. Such lovely staff and great customer service. We will keep coming back as long as Big Ern's is here."}
{"text":"Friendly, quick service.  Food was great- pulled pork sandwich was super tasty, the cole slaw was fresh and tangy, and the pickle was yummy too."}
{"text":"When I'm thinking damn I should have just got Subway, then there's a problem. I am really trying to support some of the local eateries downtown but it's really hard when some of the food is not very good. 

Let me start of by saying the service was good, the cashier was funny and friendly, the cook looked like he was happy to be there, and the place looked to be a nice place to stop into after a couple drinks at one of the bars in Container Park. But that's about where it ends.

We ordered the ribs, hot links, pulled pork sandwich, macaroni and cheese, and potato salad. Let me sum it up quick because you don't need to read a novel:
 The pulled pork sandwich was actually pretty good with the bbq sauce. 
The hot link had a decent kick to it but was a little full of gristle and was alright. 
The mac and cheese was greasy but dry and flavored with salt and water (weird).
The potato salad wasn't bad but I have a feeling it's probably going to look about the same on the way out.
The ribs were an epic fail. How are these chewy, gristly, tough stubs ribs? What animal did you take these from? I'm not even sure McDonald's would use that rib meat for their McRib. 

I like to give places the benefit of the doubt so maybe some day I'll give it another shot...and probably after a couple shots. But I hope they pull it together because a \"good\" bbq spot on Fremont would be clutch."}
{"text":"This was some of the best BBQ I have ever had the Brisket is worth goin for alone Prices are reasonable the space is small but the Food is excellent! So even if ya gotta wait or take it out Go eat this!!! We had a combo plate and it was so good we just ordered meat and ribs by the pound Service is great Met the owner really nice people amazing BBQ Can not wait to go back"}
{"text":"Was my partner's and I's first time at the Container Park and found this BBQ spot.  We were very pleased with the food.  Had the Brisket and BBQ ribs dinners, BBQ sauce is wonderful, beans were great, tho the mac & cheese and potato salad were a bit dry, but tasty.  We definitely will be back and tell people about it."}
{"text":"Big Ern's was a great experience at container park. I ordered a kid's size slider and fries. It was perfect size for me. The fries were crispy and the slider was flavorful. The customer service here is great too. If you want to add more sauce to your slider you can at the condiment table."}
{"text":"I thought this was good BBQ for the price and location.
We shared a three meat combo with two sides and two beers came out to about 22 bucks. 

The ribs are very good, had no complaints at all. The BBQ chicken wasn't bad either. Got pulled pork cause they were out of brisket. 
The coleslaw was fantastic and fresh. But the mac n cheese sucked major ass. It reminded me of box Kraft mac n cheese. 

I like the walk up ordering, portions are good. But most importantly the BBQs  are good. I don't eat much pork, but when I do it needs to be the best!

I would try this food again, overall I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I went to Big Ern's with my family for lunch. The menu is deceitful. The combo meal doesn't tell you how many ribs you get (3), and the clerk didn't tell us that I would get 3 ribs and a side for $10 or 6 for a larger price + paying $4 for a side. The ribs were sinewy and small, and our fries didn't come until 20 minutes after ordering. By this time, we really didn't want the fries at all.

I asked about the confusing sign. They're apparently in the middle of updating it. If they're aware of the problems  with the sign, the clerk should've helped me with the order.

I wish they had a Yelp advertising sign in their restaurant.... this way I wouldn't have to pay for my fries that were 20 minutes late.

We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I literally would not even feed this to a dog if I had one.

How does this place have so many positive reviews? Oh, probably because you're all caught up in the Tony-Hseih-has-a-golden-dick bubble and think that, because he endorsed this place, and it's in this stupid-looking outdoor mall, that it is of any reputable quality.

Meat is dry as hell, the sauces have no flavor (how is this possible, you ask? don't waste your money finding out), and the prices were way higher than they should be for something I'd rather throw out than give to the meth addicts waiting outside the park. 

I am very happy to say that a date took me here, so I didn't have to contribute anything to this establishment. I will say, however, that this date didn't know any better, and it wasn't his fault.

We also went during the grand opening, when you would think food would be the best. Uhhh... that's really, really sad."}
{"text":"Great food,  Ern greeted us at the door and made recommendations.  All smiles and nice employees the beans were sick good too."}
{"text":"Miserable Lady taking my order was insulting me the whole time I was tying to order \"kids menu\"  chicken fingers.  She asked if I wanted anything to drink in my \"tiny little kids cup\".  Wtf.  I asked for a standard water and she still refused to give me a regular sized cup.  Over all the  chicken strips taste like any others so I was happy I got my chicken fingers fix. For the sake of this business.  Hire new staff."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and nice portions. The brisket was overdone but the flavor was good and it was tender. The chicken was great. The fries were good. The mac and cheese was good after we added salt and pepper. The service was good. I recommend you order the food without sauce as they have 2 sauces and the default sauce wasn't as good as the the other option. I wish I could give more details about the sauces but they weren't labeled."}
{"text":"Trying to do our part to support the local businesses in the Container Park, which today, a saturday, more resembled a chuck e cheese with more strollers than I have ever seen in Vegas. I can't think of a reason to go back there and especially to Big Erns.

Just got back from this place, what can i say? Just wow...it was AWFUL. 
 
First off, the service.

Good thing you have to tip before you get your food, as the people behind the counter could not put a simple plate together in under 15 minutes. I hoped that it would be worth the painfully long wait but my hopes were quickly dashed.

We got two sandwiches and three sides, all of which were less than meh. 

Chicken sandwich=cold, dry, and undersauced on a cold bun= D-
Pulled Pork Sandwich=cold, dry, with a huge chunk of fat= F
Macncheese= Cold and cheesy with no flavor whatsoever= D-
Beans= Best on the menu and the only thing we came close to finishing=B
Coleslaw=Fresh and crisp but flavorless=C

All in all, we will never return, and I will seek out better BBQ at Mall Food Courts, and Airports."}
{"text":"I work at a downtown neighboring restaurant and like to frequent Big Ern's when I get a break. I've gotta say..... the brisket is AMAZING! 
I had the pleasure of meeting Bid Ern himself and his lovely wife Connie while eating lunch today and they were as warm and welcoming as the aromas coming from the kitchen. Always happy to support local small business owners."}
{"text":"Selena was a great server. She was so sweet with our child and made suggestions. This is the perfect place to hang out if you have young kids and want them to enjoy themselves. It's a 20 minute drive off the strip but so so worth it."}
{"text":"Most everything I saw coming out of the service window looked delicious, including my fiancee's pulled pork, so I thought it safe to order the \"jumbo chicken wings\"... they came out tiny and dried out with no flavor.  Pretty much jerky.  Picture the Safeway deli counter wings after they've been sitting in the warmer for 12 hours.  Based on neighboring customers' apparent satisfaction, I recommend anything else."}
{"text":"Completely DELICIOUS!!! Great service and excellent food. GREAT sweet tea also. I am from the South, but now I live in CA so this was like a true visit back home. We will definitely go back again whenever we are in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Tender pork! Not too much BBQ sauce! Fast service! Definitely eat there again! It's a walk up order and pick your own seat."}
{"text":"Brisket, ribs, and pulled pork are 5 star.  Pork and Beans and Mac n cheese are 3.5 star.  The girls taking orders are 5 stars (recommended what to order based on our kids relative to the amount of food and selection.  They are also very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I visited the establishment yesterday and tried out the three meat and 2 sides. I had the brisket, ribs, pulled pork, pork & beans, and Mac & cheese. I enjoyed both the ribs and brisket, but the pulled pork was dry and tasteless. I would pass on that item on the menu. BBQ bake beans were awesome, but the Mac & Cheese weren't up to par. They didn't have enough cheese and the pasta used make it chewy. Maybe the pasta was undercooked..... Free refill on drinks, but if there is a long line at the counter don't even bother trying to get a refill. 

Big side note about seating!! Space is limited inside and there are seats outside. We were originally gonna sit outside but then I noticed above your head is where people are walking and there are holes on the flooring above. If you mind dirt and other god awful things on people's shoes DO NOT SIT ON THE PATIO. 

Overall it was decent."}
{"text":"Trash!!! Cole slaw Wack beans horrible brisket dry..  Chicken average... Sauce plain..  If you are looking for stone good ole fashioned bbq this is not it smh... and they over charge."}
{"text":"Warning: This restaurant has a Grade C as of December 2015!!

We had family in town and none of us had ever been to the container park, so we decided to check it out. It was a bad idea altogether, we should have just stayed at the Fremont! But anyway, after walking around we decided to stay and eat dinner at one of the few restaurants at this place. From what we saw, our choices were BBQ, Mexican and Hot Dogs, so we decided to go with BBQ. The employees were just standing around and talking when we walked in. They did greet us, but didn't seem very friendly. The menu wasn't huge. They have the normal choices of Ribs, Pulled Pork, Brisket and Chicken. I decided to go with the Pulled Pork Dinner with Mac and Cheese and Sweet Potato Fries. Right when the cashier handed the receipt to my brother in law, that is when I noticed the sign showing the Grade C. Crap! Well, it was too late now. The food was already paid for and I doubt that the employees would be willing to give a refund. If we didn't have family with us, I probably would have fought it lol.

The food was brought out by one of the cooks and it just went downhill from there. I took the first bite of the pulled pork and it was cold. Maybe it was just that side of the plate? So I took another bite from the other side and it was still cold. Ugh, really? It wasn't fresh, but did they forget to warm up the pork or did they just not give a damn? I think they just poured BBQ sauce over it and called it a day. It was so bad that I can't even remember if the BBQ sauce was good or not. The Mac and Cheese and the Sweet Potato Fries were actually hot, but there was nothing spectacular about them either. I didn't even try the roll that came with the dinner, the bread was not edible at all. 

The next day, I felt sick, even though I barely ate the food. Well, I did eat food from Panera as well, but I am 99.9% sure I got sick from this place! Don't expect anything good from a BBQ restaurant in a container. 

Never Again!! Stay Away!!"}
{"text":"So completely wonderful! , the smells drew us in... the taste will being us back!! I love  good pig and being able to add my own amount of sauce was a  wonderful idea! Just wish you had more beer choices. That's why four stars. Other than that a five star experience. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for a quickie so we just had a beer and a pulled pork sandwich to share. The sandwich was hands down one of the best pork sandwiches we had ever tried. 

Service was quick and promt and they also have the cheapest beer in the container park area wich is a big plus.  

Kind service add to the experience."}
