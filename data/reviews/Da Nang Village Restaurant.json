{"text":"Vietnamese food is notoriously bad for vegetarians, and this place is no exception.

This place seemed to be really good, busy, clean, but once again I have been bamboozled by a Toronto restaurant. I was so excited when I say tofu and spring rolls on the menu. Finally a veggie vermicelli dish! So simple and so rare.

I ordered it and the tofu had meat inside. I asked the waiter if it was tofu. He said yes. I almost returned to eating but then made a fuss and the manager came. After arguing over the definition of tofu with me I was informed the tofu was meat covered in some batter. This is called tofu here. Also the spring rolls in the tofu dish were meat as well. 

I did eat some of this and as a vegetarian I am pretty upset. It's really too bad since the food looked great. But how hard is it to make a non-meat version of a dish? Just leave the meat off! Seems easy."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS, its always the smaller places that make the BEST FOOD! You can tell that you are getting quality food, the flavors are on point and will be coming back here for years to come. Listen,  if you're looking for authentic good Vietnamese food look no further. 

Ambiance is typical Vietnamese restaurant without the bells and whistles, which in my opinion isn't needed. There are many places in Toronto that spend more time on the appearance versus the food. This restaurant delivers on the food time and time again. 

Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! My favourite Vietnamese in the city!

They offer Pho, like all the Vietnamese restuarants in the city, and I think the broth is homemade (super delicious, even according to my grandpa, who is much MUCH harder to impress). The noodles are never overdone and everything tastes hot and fresh!

The rice wraps that they have are AMAZING! they bring out the rice paper contraption that lets you prepare the wraps at your table and load them up. The meat they come with is delicious! the spring rolls are super meaty and fresh and crunchy and hot, and all the pickles and veggies and herbs that go into the wrap are delicious. This platter also comes with the shrimp cake wrapped sugar cane (Which are much more delicious than I'm making them sound). (ORDER THE H1)

Ambience is nothing special (no surprise), and service is good, but nothing to write home about tea and napkins kept coming (and the tea is a nice floral tea. 

Will definitely be coming back!!!!!!"}
