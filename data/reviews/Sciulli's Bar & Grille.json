{"text":"Hands down the best fish sandwich I have ever had!  I'm very impressed by all the renovations that the new owners have made.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst bar in the Pittsburgh area. If you want a bar that's unfriendly and uncooperative with their guests then this is the bar. Other than that you can come here for cold bar food, bad service, poorly poured beer, horrible music and a drafty back room."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They have really good specials on great bar food. The inside is clean and new. There is a bar with a bit of a backwoods feel, and a separate dining area if you are brining the kids. There are TVs set up by the bar if you are watching a game, and a solid draft beer selection. They also have reasonably priced 6-packs to go. Staff has been attentive and super friendly. 

You can't beat the Monday night $5 burger special, or the massive $0.35 wings on Wednesdays. 

I will be back often. Definitely a gem in the area."}
{"text":"Will return. Enjoyed $9 buffalo chicken salad, enough for two meals, lots of good fresh stuff in it.  Good fish. Sandwiches are only $8 w soup, slaw or fries.  Theresa is friendly, delightful.   Fast service."}
{"text":"Awesome local bar to go to. Drinks are very reasonably priced, bar staff is upbeat and nice. The food is also amazing, especially their loaded fries. The back room has tons of things to do other than drink. They have pool, darts, beer pong, video games. Also lot's of TVs for sports. Very nice place to go relax."}
{"text":"This bar is closed and will reopen under the name \"Rockys\""}
{"text":"To start off ... the 3 waitresses all approached me for refills, assisting with menu selection, etc.   

Ample parking.  It is obviously a Cheers like bar ... lots of regulars.  No sloppy drunks. Separate pool table section which allows smokers.

I couldn't decide between the shrimp salad, taco salad, or fish tacos.  I went with the fried cod with a spicy mango salsa tacos.  They were very good.  

People around me were ordering wings ... spicy enough that I teared up.

Definitely worth the trip to McKees Rocks."}
{"text":"Words can't describe the treatment I received.  The owners girlfriend is the bartender and is so rude. I was treated with disrespect and called a bitch as I walked out the door. All because I asked for a drink. 
My suggestion for the owner is this:
1. Get a new girlfriend that will bring in business or,
2. Get a new bartender.
Either way she is costing you business and therefore costing get you money."}
{"text":"Bartender was very nice.  I got the fish sandwich which was good. I wish they had some more non meat options and I would give it a 5 star.  But I had no problem parking and I sat at the bar by myself and wasn't bothered.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Update to my review below:

Calling the food here \"bar food\" is an injustice. First, the items you might find at another bar, are done up right with regards to flavor, quality, and quantity. On top of that, they have a newly expanded menu that features some unbelievable pasta dishes. They are doing some real cooking at this place, not just dropping fryer baskets like you might find elsewhere. 

The waitstaff and bartenders are also great. They are attentive, efficient, and very friendly. They definitely don't put up with any crap, and keep the atmosphere in check. 

Excellent spot for dinner, watching sports, playing pool/darts, or just getting some drinks. 

Without question, this place is a gem in the Rocks!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with a smoking / pool section in the back. Almost doesn't fit into McKees Rocks. They have so much parking but definitely Go for the wing night they have rocking flavors and $5 beer pitchers!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently ate here for the second time since the new management took over. The menu was greatly expanded and they also have IPA beers now. My husband and I had Miller Lites on draft and they were both ice cold and frothy. He had one of the best Delmonico steak wraps he ever ate, and cooked just to his taste. I enjoyed my gyro, with large pieces of lamb on a fresh pita. Each were about $7 -$8.The owner (or cook?), came around twice to see if everything was satisfactory, and we assured him it was excellent. Our waitress was very friendly and happily gave us all the beer choices since there was no list yet. The only changes I might make are to brighten the dining room a little more and have some music piped in. There is a TV on the wall but we would rather enjoy music when eating."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the best cooked chicken I've ever eaten in Western Pennsylvania"}
{"text":"I think this the best battered fish in Western PA and the Mac n' Cheese is terrific.

Wednesday night Wings n' Weinee's are a real bargain.  Great   wings and french fries along with quarter pound hot dogs.
 
Service is good and prices are reasonable.  The owners have really improved the place. I hope they can upgrade the lighting in the dining room."}
