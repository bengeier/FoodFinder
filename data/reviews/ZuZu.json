{"text":"We ate here twice and both times the food was outstanding. The Kung Pao Hen is amazing, and so are the green chile grits. The short rib hash is inspired. Whoever is running the kitchen is talented. Love the well-restored mid century decor. The service is friendly, eager, and a little amateurish (forgot to bring my husband new utensils, cleared a cocktail glass before I had finished it). Nothing unforgivable, but maybe a little more training is in order."}
{"text":"So far, this is by far the best breakfast we have had in the area. It was a tad on the pricey side probably because it's in a hotel, but the food and coffee were delicious with generous portions. The service was wonderful. Hubby had the lemon cream cheese stuffed brioche French toast and I had an omelet stuffed with broccolini, carmelized onions and roasted tomatoes with a side of bacon. It was one of those meals that had us practically moaning with every bite 'cause it was so tasty! Oh yeah, free valet parking!"}
{"text":"I live accross the street from this establishment. It is very good. The Bartenders and service staff get a \"10\". The food is very good. But they go over the top w/ some of their entree's.......I think they need to study the menu from Eddie \"V\"'s, \"Paul Martin's\" and \"Bandera\". Hello Prime-Dip's? But no Prime-Rib on the menu? They need to do some 60's classic's. For instance The \"Wedge of Lettuce\" w/ Blue Cheese. The Hotel is Retro, how bout Retro entrees???? \"Rack of Lamb\" Now how hard is that? Main-Stream soups........The soup's are ALWAY's to over the edge! How about Shrimp-Scampi ? Like I said pick up on the above mentioned restaurants you might yes you might get a great insight to what you need to offer..... Here comes another review from me........."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for breakfast for her birthday. Thought the good reviews were worth trying somewhere new.  This was a let down. The food was average at best and the menu was very limited. Maybe my expectations were too high.  I ordered the eggs benedict and the grilled cheese.  The Benedict was nothing special and the grilled cheese was just horrible. Too much avocado and green chili made it cold and there was not nearly enough cheese. The bread was thick which made the lack of cheese even worse. My girlfriend had over easy eggs with bacon and potatoes.  Hard to mess that up and she said it was good.  I really expected something special and didn't get it. Service was good and multiple people checked in on us....So that was a plus."}
{"text":"We had such high hopes.  Cafe Zuzu was a huge disappointment today.  The decor was the best part of the meal.  From a lethargic, disinterested waitress to a kitchen staff that required 45 minutes to serve undercooked food to the only table waiting for service in the restaurant, it was just a sad experience for our family.  After waiting 40 minutes, we approached the hostess for help with where our food might be.  Why the hostess?  Because our waitress had become completely invisible.  We looked but could not find her.    When the food did arrive, it came in spurts.  With three people serving, you'd think they could get all the food out at once.  Alas, they could not.  We all had to wait another 10 minutes until the entire party was served.   Now for the food.  We ordered burgers, a sliced turkey dinner and some chicken fingers.  The burgers were the best of the lot, made with an excellent quality beef patty, delicious cheese and a tender bun.  The sliced turkey was god-awful horrid.  It clearly wasn't carved from anything resembling a real bird, but was some type of formed meat buried under a half cup of salty canned gravy.  An assortment of fresh steamed vegetables were the best thing on that plate.  A side serving of mashed potatoes was another miss.  Clearly reconstituted, the potatoes were tasteless and without proper texture.  I've had better when visiting Grandma in the nursing home.  The organic greens salad was excellent; not so for the torn iceberg salads which could have been made by a three year old.  The onion rings were greasy but good.  The wonderful salted dinner rolls were the hit of the night.  next time I visit Zuzu I may just buy a basket of bread.  Now for the final insult, for some reason, our waitress served us room temperature water without ice.  Who does this?  Why?  The management tried to make apologies for the kitchen, and we would accept them, if it weren't obvious that the problems with the food and service were not limited to our table.    Whoever is the manager of Cafe Zuzu, please take note:  you can do so much better.  We came for the wedge salad and great burgers and got \"torn\" iceberg (it was clearly chopped) and undercooked burgers that arrived cold.  Please, talk to your staff.  They're going to put you out of business if they keep performing like this when you're not in the building.  Hope you do better for us next time."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour. Specialty cocktails are $3 and apps are $5 each. There is outdoor seating with a view of the pool and the area is nicely landscaped. When you walk into the lounge, it's like stepping back in time. Very mid-century modern."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Valley Ho a few days, so I had a chance to experience the Zuzu for all three meals. All of which, from what I ordered, we're amazing and extremely delish. The night coconut cream pie was the featured dessert was my fav. So delicious without being disgustingly sweet. The fries, salads, sandwiches, just everything I tried was good. The BLT and truffle grilled cheese are to die for. Even the side of asparagus was really good. Service was also really good and friendly."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch and it was excellent. The patio looked inviting, but we ended up sitting inside. The ambiance is definitely right out of the 1960's. You almost expect Dean Martin or Brigitte Bardot to be at the next table. The food was great and the servers eager to please. We'll be back."}
{"text":"About half of San Francisco descends on Scottsdale in March for spring training games so I made it a point to make a reservation here way ahead of time, sight unseen. From the outside, I wasn't sure if I wanted to have a meal at a motel, but once inside I'm glad we followed through. it was my dad's birthday so all the retro charm actually served up some good memories for him when he saw interiors like this the first time. I'm used to small plates meaning \"several plates til you feel full.\" Here that meant two plates. The dressing on the kale salad took away any inherent bitterness and the lamb sausage had a great spice to it. The almond cake was moist and easily divvied up between us."}
{"text":"5 stars for brunch/breakfast! Went hear for a Sunday brunch while visiting phoenix. We've had our fair share of excellent brunches, so I was cautiously excited when I saw the menu which included toffee pancakes. Zuzu's food exceeded my expectations. First, they bring a variety of fresh scones to the table. They were delicious and could have almost been a brunch themselves. Our table also got both of the eggs Benedicts, an omelet,  and the toffee panackes. The pancakes were out of this world... must try! In addition to the yummy food, the hotel is pretty cool. Only annoyance was parking - it's easiest to just valet. The fee is free but need to tip."}
{"text":"When visiting on vacation, I'm kind of at the whim of my hosts (which is not a problem in the slightest). So I was taken along to Zuzu, located inside the Hotel Valley Ho, which I am warned is \"retro.\" This is, in fact, the truth as the hotel looks like something out of an episode of Scooby Doo and the hotel like a malt shop where those meddling teens hang out.  Except, of course, for the full bar and menu serving more than malts.  We ended up there for brunch, where I tried the mushroom and bacon omelette, which featured fried onions and cream cheese. This arrived on a plate with toast of my choosing and potatoes. The omelette was good, save for very little cream cheese, and ketchup/jam didn't show up until 2/3 through the meal (a bit annoying). The jam needed pectin, as it was exceptionally soupy, and not very tasty (an apricot marmalade was the best I could identify).  It was not busy at all there, so the staff were very attentive. Overall, I'd go back, and probably branch out more into the menu before I rated this any higher."}
{"text":"Great service. Delicious bar style food. And the people watching does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Lots of healthy options and prices are reasonable. Friendly servers and don't feel rushed."}
{"text":"Great place with a modern vibe and retro/70s influence. The cocktails were top notch and the food was delicious. Pricey, but you are getting a good atmosphere and good food and service."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the rainy weekend I may never have tried the restaurant on Friday night.  It was excellent, the staff was great.  The breakfast staff seem a tiny bit less friendly.....  not sure what's up with that.  Couldn't figure out what the happy hour was though.  May go back - may not.  The food was great, but would like a little more clarity on what happy hour is and would like to see at least an acknowledgement when you sit down for coffee in the morning."}
{"text":"There's not much I can say about ZuZu's happy hour that hasn't already been said - it's one of the very best values in town! $3 appetizers, cocktails, glasses of wine, and beers mean that you can leave here either really full or really hammered (or a bit of each) for under $20, including tax and tip! All the apps are a good deal and most are very tasty - the only one I wasn't fond of was the terribly over-salted chicken wings. The cocktails aren't weak like you'd expect for $3, and the wine selection is decent. The beers are the only thing that aren't a good deal, in my opinion - you can find domestics for $3 at many places even when it's not happy hour. After a long day or work (or play), you really will be happy after an hour at ZuZu."}
{"text":"No visit to AZ is complete without brunch at ZUZU!  I always splurge on an Ho-J---which is so good I'll never settle for an orange Julius again!  Never had a bad entree on their menu! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about this restaurant that I was really looking forward to trying it. The atmosphere has a retro chic feel and has cocktail hour written all over it. :) I'm a sucker for 50's inspired design...Jacobsen's Swan Chair...Oh la la!  We decided to ring in Friday with lunch outside the office at Cafe ZuZu. I thought the menu offered a large selection of items from chili and salad to sandwiches and burgers. Prior to ordering, the waitress brought over a basket of rolls (or buns as we say in Canadian). They were a slightly sweet eggy bread that melted in my mouth. I decided to try the Seared Ahi Salad with an Asian dressing. The Ahi was prepared perfectly, slightly seared on the outside and juicy on the inside. It was presented on a bed of spinach, with yellow peppers and sliced onions - delicious! My coworkers all tried something different: Salmon Salad, Border Chili (which looked incredible), and the half sandwich with soup. From their response it sounded like the Border Chili was the ticket!  I was pretty impressed with my overall experience and will be back for cocktail hour! I give Cafe ZuZu four stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite place!  The service is over the top....they always make you feel like you this is your home. Travis is the best bartender in the whole wide world!  Miwa is an amazing manager and runs a tight ship. I hope this place never changes. Can't say enough good things!!"}
{"text":"When we venture to The Valley Ho we're never disappointed. We joined Chef Chuck Wiley for the Monday night Chef's Table. The atmosphere was fun as usual, and the staff went above and beyond to make guests really enjoy themselves.  The menu was delicious, and the wines that were paired really complimented every course.  ZuZu is always consistent, and for that we'll always be returning guests!"}
{"text":"I have frequented ZuZu numerous times for dinner with family or friends and never walked away disappointed. While the food is essentially simple it tends to be very well done as you would expect for the price.   The iceberg lettuce wedge salad was absolutely ridiculously big, I suggest splitting it unless you plan on grazing for awhile. The grilled salmon, ahi tuna salad, and beef stroganoff have all been proven to be consistent palette pleasers and the Bourbon Mac Daddy from the bar was perfect. Dinner service has always been prompt and friendly but not intrusive. Obviously, a booth is quite nice for a small party or a couple on a date, they are relatively cozy, somewhat quieter than the main floor, and have excellent lighting. The decor is relatively contemporary, as you would expect in Scottsdale/Valley Ho with a sprinkle of Frank Loyd Wright's influence in the central columns, but largely has a very relaxed and warm feeling. As a springtime alternative they also have a wonderful outdoor patio.  ZuZu is quite popular on Friday and Saturday nights thus if possible I strongly recommend reservations or trying to go on off peak days for a more enjoyable dining experience. If you do decide to pop in at the last minute and are faced with a consequential wait there is a very relaxed bar adjacent to ZuZu in the lobby of the Valley Ho which you could easily pass the time.

{"text":"Only giving this 1 star due to horrible WAITSTAFF AND HOSTESS TEAM. I brought my younger sister here for a birthday brunch with my mom who was visiting from the east coast. I saw the amazing reviews and raves about the Eggs Benedict, and knowing that was her favorite I had to bring her here!  I went to the restaurant 2 hours before our reservation with flowers for my sister, asking that they be placed at the reserved table as a surprise. I also asked that a cake (made by the restaurant) be presented directly after the entree, also as a surprise.  When we arrived, the flowers were not on the table... no big deal, I just thought they may have forgotten. I kindly asked the two hostesses (same as I had seen earlier) to please bring the flowers out. 10 minutes after we were seated, the flowers were still not brought out, so I went back inside and asked them again and they were brought out....  We ordered drinks from our server and after receiving them, didn't see him until we asked the hostesses for him to come take our order. Thinking he may be new, we put that aside and ordered our food.  The food came, and it was absolutely impeccable. They definitely have some amazing chefs and that should not be masked by the horrible staff they have.  I want to wrap this up by saying that the men who refilled our waters and cleared our plates were by far the best staff that zuzu has to offer. The manager ended up coming to our table and apologizing AFTER the waiter and hostesses forgot the cake after our meal.... surprise surprise at this point.  My mom and I spent so much time planning out the perfect brunch for my sister and it put a huge damper on the entire day.... just wishing they could be a little bit more detail oriented and not keep promises they can't keep. Didn't think we were asking much but obviously more than they could handle."}
{"text":"Had a good meal after a long day of traveling. The tomato basil soup was delicious and the beet and goat cheese salad had a perfect mix of tomatoes, beets, fraise and pecans and was dressed well.  I was dining alone and was quite comfortable which is not always the case. All and all, a good experience. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"My inaugural Yelp post! Yes, I did it for the free wine w/ check-in... Ha! Truffled grilled cheese, CA Benedict, homemade potato chips all exxxxcellent. Alyssa is a great server. Really all was perfect."}
{"text":"Got some late night desserts after eating dinner from the Herb Box. Liked their banana cream pie and rich hot chocolate."}
{"text":"Service was very slow, despite not being very busy. We were also not given the scones. The waitress brought the butter and jam for them, but no scones.   Food and mimosas were very good."}
{"text":"Things you might not know about ZuZu: - most ingredients sourced locally - much of the produce is organic, and bought seasonally from local farms - 95% of everything made from scratch in the kitchen including their awesome dinner rolls - pei mussels flown in fresh 3 times a week  Seriously, seriously good place.  I really like the effort the chef puts in about getting locally sourced produce and products when they can.  Also, everything is extremely high quality from the fresh produce all the way to the awesome desserts.  I would say it is like higher-end comfort food, but with special flair from the chef depending on what fresh ingredients he gets in.  Also, the price is ridiculously good for the quality of meal you are getting.   The name makes it sound like a coffee shop in the middle of a hotel but it is so not.  It's decorated mid-century modern and a very cool place for dinner.    Dinners are fabulous but breakfast is awesome too, and you can't pass up that make your own bloody mary bar.  Some things that are awesome: - The mussels, with chorizo.  SO good - Asian pear and endive salad  - Orange and ginger seared ahi - Grilled lamb sausage  - Caprese salad - the tomatoes are sooo good and fresh - Ho-J: This is on their breakfast menu and is basically an orangecicle smoothy.  Fresh squeezed orange juice and ice cream.    If I was a local, I'd be going here all the time.  Knowing that the ingredients are local and many are organic and that most everything is made from scratch just makes you feel better about the choice of eating there."}
{"text":"It's 1961 and we're having lunch in the courtyard of our Miami Beach hotel. Parker House rolls, sweet and salty, an open-face meatloaf sandwich with mushroom gravy. There's a surf board and a tiki carving amidst the flowers. But wait - something's wrong!! There's no humidity! Those are imported mushrooms in my gravy! I work to orient myself in time and space and find, what a relief, that I'm actually in Cafe ZuZu in downtown Scottsdale and it's 2010.   The Valley Ho Resort, which houses the Cafe, is such a wonderful period piece. It opened in 1956 and was renovated in 2005 by a very wise design team that left the mid-century architecture and spirit intact. Cafe ZuZu is at the far end of the lobby, and its charming patio is surrounded with flowers. The decor is late 50's. If you're as old as we are, you'll recognize it instantly. The menu consists of \"Flavorful American comfort food. Familiar favorites with a contemporary twist.\" There are goodies like warm Maytag blue cheese fondue ($7.50), truffled grilled cheese ($9), beef stroganoff ($17), and (gross) tuna salad with cottage cheese which brings me back to my childhood a little too clearly.   While waiting for our entrees, we received a basket of Parker House rolls. These are the nice squishy white bread treats that, if you can manage not to eat them all, make wonderful toys. You can mold them into sculptures, or shape them into little round beebees to shoot through your straw. My meatloaf sandwich ($11.25) was served on a thick piece of grilled white bread topped first with melty cheese, then the meatloaf, then the gravy. There was a mound of lumpless mashed potatoes alongside. They were so smooth Ken wondered if they were made from instant, but they tasted much too good for that. The portion was huge, I took half home (of course I knew I was going to have dessert). Ken had sauteed liver, beautifully prepared, atop a mound of kale that had been cooked with high quality bacon, sauced with a Madera reduction. He loved it. I surprised him by ordering a lemon meringue tart ($6) for us to share. There were several chocolate desserts that sounded good, but I had a vision of the mile high meringue toppings of my childhood. The tart had only modest swirls of meringue, but it had been made in such a way that it was creamy, as opposed to foamy, and it was really good.The lemon custard was the star. I remembered a gelatinous filling, but this was smooth and velvety, with just the right tart/sweet balance. The pastry was a cross between cookie and pie crust, and stood up well to the filling.   This was not an inexpensive meal, but the portions are large and quality is excellent. Plus we had joined an organization called The Lunch Club, which every weekday, emails it's members a discount coupon for a restaurant in their specified zip code. So one of our entrees was free! (The discount coupons differ, some are 20% off the bill, others merely are for a free drink). But, to pay Cafe ZuZu the ultimate compliment - I'd come here and pay full price."}
{"text":"Pretty dang great!  Awesome spot for Sunday breakfast.  Love the retro vibe too."}
{"text":"First I have to say this is a BREAKFAST review, so I can't say I have anything but promise for a good lunch or dinner. Honey and I spent the night at the Valley Ho and sauntered down for breakfast around 9am on a Sunday. We were seated in a super swank booth immediately and had ice water and coffee within seconds of being seated. BONUS. Their silverware and coffee cups are so in tune with the whole VH scene, it just makes you feel...well, special. I wanted to steal the cute little teaspoons, but my Catholic guilt prevailed, as always. I ordered the banana buttermilk pancakes (a sucker for dessert for breakfast) and Honey got the Denver omelet. We perused the NY Times, had a refill of pretty good coffee (we are coffee snobs) before our food arrived which, in my assessment, was the perfect amount of time.  My pancakes were so pretty and seemed as happy to see me as I them. Outer edges thin and crispy, sliced bananas on top and...wait for it...a banana puree between each flapjack. OMG. Every bite was better than the last and I barely used half my ration of syrup as it seemed sacrilegious to mess with the medley of buttermilk and bananas in any way other than to fork it into my cakehole.  Honey's omelet was so vibrant looking which yes, is bizarre for an egged-up entree. But it was. The veggies were crisp tender and accounted for most of the ROYGBIV you'd want on a plate. Also the perfect balance of ham and cheese and served with yummy potatoes and lightly toasted sourdough.  All in all, we were very pleased and felt it was appropriate to return to our hotel room and nap off our fabulous start to the day. P.S. Dear Jesse T: ROYGBIV equates to all the colors of the rainbow. Beautiful work!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food.  I ate dessert after eating at what was once open, Trader Vics.  The dessert here was great.  I had the special, the chocolate satin pie.  This was a very good choice.  I will come back here for dinner in the near future."}
{"text":"This chefs is world class dining at its best.  Our server Patrick was so awesome too... I don't think I realy need to say more, just that you are missing out if you don't try this place for a chefs table night!"}
{"text":"I really hate that my 1st review is not a good one but the service is what is bringing down the rating.  The food was outstanding!  We we're seated pretty quickly but it took almost 10 mins to get a waiter to bring us coffee and then another 10+ mins to get any refills.   The food was perfect!  I haven't had better for breakfast!  I will try again but I'm very concerned about the level of service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of time for breakfast and lunch over the past few months. The food is good and responsible priced. The grilled cheese and their ice tea is my favorite though! The staff are always present and the atmosphere is laid back and fun!"}
{"text":"We went for the happy hour and were NOT disappointed. The appetizers were delicious and cheap (highly recommend the grilled cheese appetizers... brie, fig jam and apples? Yes, please) and the drinks were more booze than filler, a great deal for $3 a pop. I left with a wonderful buzz and a full stomach for a mere $18, which is unheard of. The service was friendly and the atmosphere was laid back but fun."}
{"text":"Ambience five star  Cocktails five stars Service five stars Food three stars  We had a great time enjoying a strll around the very Retro Valley Ho.  We enjoyed Zuzu's ambience and hanging out in the lounge having a cocktail ...the dining room was exquisite...BUT the food was lacking. There were three of us.  We ordered the roasted butternut squash, the shrimp entree  and a Caesar salad with grilled chicken breast... We all felt the food was average at best. Enjoy a cocktail the lounge, but our recommendation is to go somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"First off, the ambiance is Mid-Century chic and inviting. We  had been here before and liked it so this time, we just stopped in for breakfast during  the week. We were not guests at hotel. We were seated, looked over the menu, made our selection and waited for someone to take our order. And waited. And waited. It was not busy, but it seemed short staffed. My friend approached the hostess to tell her we were ready to order. Hostess was polite and got a waitress to come to our table. The woman who showed up was rude and made no eye contact. Really bad attitude. When meal arrived, eggs were dry and on the cold side, \"toast\" was not toasted, just warm bread. We asked for toast to be toasted. The waitress said she would get another serving. Again, no toast, just warm bread. Belgian waffle seemed like a frozen waffle. Overall, an unpleasant experience with mediocre food and very rude service. Will not go back to eat there."}
{"text":"Vintage vibe with excellent food. The Valley Ho is one of Scottsdale's celebrity hotels from the 50s and 60s. It has been renovated to its original glory. ZuZu has transformed over the last few years from old fashioned comfort food to an upscale menu with a selective offering, but everything is wonderful. The ambiance adds to the delight."}
{"text":"As if the atmosphere in the Hotel Valley Ho wasn't already fantastic, this little area near the hotel' lounge and bar area is understated and upscale at the same time. I went for happy hour and truly enjoyed the options. I went with the ZuZu Senorita which was a signature cocktail while my friend got the sparkling wine, both $4. I liked my drink but the rim needed salt and perhaps a little less tequila (it was a very HAPPY hour). We each ordered a side. I got the prime rib dip and she orded the pretzels with chips and cheese. Each of us were in food heaven. The prime rib dip came with an au jau sauce and had the most melt in your mouth cheese on top. The meet was fall off the bone good and the bread was perfect. Two little slices were enough to satisfy a happy hour hunger.   I would def go back here for fancy drinks with a friend, hopefully grab a sit on the patio outside. Parking is complimentary valet and the car boys are very sweet."}
{"text":"The twice cooked fries are awesome.  The BBQ burger had good flavor, but was a little bit burnt on the outside.  Service was nice, but we didn't find out we couldn't charge food to our rooms until after they brought the check for our group (wouldn't have been a big deal, except we had been allowed to do so the day before when we sat in smaller groups)."}
{"text":"My favorite spot to grab a drink after a long day at work when I'm going all by my lonesome! Friendly, attentive staff, good selection for drinks and they are happy to whip up cocktails that aren't on the menu. Not to mention the eye candy staff and guests! Def stop by on a weeknight for happy hour or during the late evening!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the decor! It's exactly like my bathroom. The food was like what I leave behind in my bathroom. Having said that the French fries were excellent.   The staff was courteous and complimented me on my stunning ensemble, rightly so. They stumbled when they were unable to fulfill my request for water with aromatic spices. For this reason I would recommend using caution before deciding to dine at this location. The devil is in the details."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place. It's beautiful and reasonably priced. I love to come here for brunch with the $6 mimosa and bloody mary bar. The bagel sandwich is huge and so good! The potatoes are delicious. I've never been here for dinner, but it's my go-to brunch place because it's never busy unless it's a holiday."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday today with 25 girlfriends at ZuZu and the staff and food was tremendous...big shout out to Patrick the manager and Matt (the server) and all the other servers.  Great ambiance...Great service....food was wonderful.  We all enjoyed it very much and the ladies were impressed by it.  The patio was a peaceful enjoyable setting."}
{"text":"Excellent. Look forward to going back. Great service. Cool restaurant. Almost 5 star. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We wanted a nice Christmas dinner with family. Instead, we received an expensive, disappointing meal. The cut of prime rib was amongst the worst I've had, and the sides were so so.  The  poor service and meal experience was inexcusable!"}
{"text":"Very cool vintage ambiance! The food was delicious! I had the kale salad and my hubby enjoyed the turkey BLT. The fries were yummy with the Siracha dipping sauce! Would love to come back and try out the brunch and bloodymary bar!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me to dinner here and it was great! I got the Scottish Salmon. The waiter and chef were very accommodating of my food allergies and made me a gluten free crust for the salmon. The waiter was also very helpful when my friend had questions about the beer menu. I live in the area and will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Burgers are solid and mini pork shanks are delicious. Although we sat at the bar, the service wasn't great as they forgot about us. But could have been just one of those days. But I would definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"Well we tried this Restraunt again after had great food but horrible service ....I choose this location for a friends birthday party this Friday the 8th out on the patio was super excited had forgotten about experience and guess what ??? Yes once again the worst most immature rude waiter named Brian the whole party was so disappointed but they could not believe such a great new little place had such horrible service and once again out in the patio area ..... As much as I love it here and would definitely recommend cause food and end environment is awesome I just won't go or invite my friends we are foodies and love to try new places and this his been sheer disappointment on service Brian needs to go !!! Sorry but its a fact ....so disappointed !!!"}
{"text":"I usually shy away from expensive trendy restaurants but it was my birthday, and I wasn't paying.   The food was pretty good, not the best but definitely not the worst. I had a chicken penne with a pesto cream sauce that was really rich but flavorful. The chicken was swimming in the cream sauce, but still managed to be remarkably dry. I did like the addition of the sun dried tomatoes- they were a sparse but tasty commodity on the plate.   The atmosphere is really nice, it's dim and romantic, particularly when seated in one of the round booths along the back wall. The service is prompt and friendly, unlike many of the trendy restaurants in town. We were too stuffed for dessert, unfortunately, but it sounded amazing. We  did have coffee after dinner, but my espresso was a bit more bitter than it needed to be.   If you want to impress your date, this is a great place for that. Just make sure they aren't vegetarian because there isn't much on the menu for the veg-heads."}
{"text":"Fantastic Food, we stayed at the hotel for 7 nights while there for work and tried just about everything on the menu. Great cocktails too!"}
{"text":"We went for Sunday brunch a few weeks ago. So unorganized. Staff mostly just stands around and is ignorant. What I think was the manager was walking around looking confused like she didn't know which way was up. Other tables seemed to be losing their patience as well. This place has so much potential. Sadly, it hasn't gotten it right."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Zuzu several times while staying at Valley Ho. Our favorite so far has been the short rib hash for breakfast. The Bloody Mary bar is also excellent but not sure if they always have it. My daughter loved the chicken sticks we had for an appetizer. Service and atmosphere has been really good."}
{"text":"Only been here twice but definitely going to be our new little getaway. Full bar with a nice wine list. They have a limited menu until midnight- appetizers, some salads, sandwiches, burgers, & couple entrees. atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"Not cool waited forever the waitress threw the kitchen under the buss all through service. Food was ok but they need to space out the tables wait staff is overwhelmed"}
{"text":"service here is a joke!! the restaurant manager needs to be organized and not so frantic. the rest of the staff just stands around and socializes with each other!! the food isn't anything special. maybe I came on a bad day? I guess I will never know..."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Limited food selection (one seafood, one beef, one chicken, etc. dinner item), but great flavor and presentation.."}
{"text":"Executive Chef Chuck is one of my favorite people. So much thought goes into his cuisine. I have had many an item off the menu. The salads are the best in the valley. I now like beets because of the salad here. Drinks are Devine. Desserts are what dreams are made of. Happy hour is a hidden deal. Go here for a fantastic dining experience."}
{"text":"First time here. Read about their breakfast on a blog, and decided to give it a try. First impression was great. Free valet parking, and great service as soon as I walked in the door. The place was kind of empty, so I was immediately seated. The waitress recommended their breakfast smoothie, which was pretty good!  I ordered the Colorado omelette and red velvet waffle. The food was good; however, I wasn't completely blown away. The omelette and everything in it taste very fresh (not sure of this place is farm to table). However the red velvet waffle was mediocre. The creme on top was a little off. Needless to say, the experience was great and I definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"My friends and I have always loved the Happy Hour in the bar but I was disappointed last night to find out the menu has changed and our favorite beef and horseradish sandwich is no longer offered. My friend and I sat at the bar and we were surprised when the bartenders ignored us after they had served our beers. We finally had to ask for some food and although we both tried different items from the new menu, they did not compare.  Maybe it was because it was Friday night, but it was extremely noisy with people standing in a group or leaning across us to order at the bar. I have sat there many times before and have not had that experience but it seemed this group of young people were very loud.  Sorry to say I will have to mark this off my list of places to take my friends and to stop extolling its virtues to the people I meet."}
{"text":"I'm pasting the same comment four times so it posts as a review and not as a tip.  Really enjoyed the happy hour.  Ate a valley-ho lot of food.  Great drinks too.

{"text":"This place is a MUST for breakfast / brunch.  If you're a local, you'll feel like you're on vacation.  It's hidden at the Hotel Valley Ho in Old Town Scottsdale.  The atmosphere is clean and retro.  Great place to take out of town guests, and there's rarely a wait, which is great if you're cranky in the morning like me and need your coffee NOW.  Their menu is pretty expansive, there's something for everyone.  My husband gets the smoked salmon platter with accompaniments and I get the yogurt parfait w/ homemade granola and fresh berries.  Very high quality ingredients, and you can have a healthy meal without compromising taste and pleasure.    Very nice shaded patio with a view of garden-like flower beds and the pool.   I've been for Dinner on three occasions. It was fine - Let's rank it a three star dinner.  The parking is tough.  Either valet at the hotel (muh!), or park in the lot of the former Trader Vic's and enter through the pedestrian gate to the West, or park in what looks more like an   employee parking lot, directly off of 64th Street (?) and use the walkway east-ward."}
{"text":"In the Valley Ho hotel at end of main st. Decor to die for, space age bachelor pad extreme. Good bar and lounge, outdoor seating, food we had was 3 stars only, but ambiance made up for it."}
{"text":"My family and I went to ZuZu for Thanksgiving dinner and it was delicious!  The turkey was moist, gravy amazing and the chorizo stuffing untradional but very complementary! The server was nice and pleasent but I wanted to thank the manager Pete for making the dining experience very memeorable. He came by and talked with us, made jokes with my kids and I could feel he wanted our Thanksgiving to be  enjoyable.  Thank You ZuZu for letting me sit back, not cook and enjoy a holiday."}
{"text":"Every week or so we try out a different restaurant. Today it was Zuzu at the Valley Ho. What a nice experience! Comfortable booths and chairs, charming retro decor, great service and very good food. Loved the hot scones brought to the table shortly after we sat down. Our omelet and Eggs Benedict were tasty and my companion really liked the potatoes that came with his meal. We will definitely come again."}
{"text":"We came for Father's Day brunch on yelp recommendations and were not disappointed. From the valet parking to hostess to service, everyone was attentive and welcoming. The food was excellent and the Mimosa and Bloody Mary bar was fully stocked, clean and one of the best I've seen.  As long time valley residents (my husband is a native who grew up nearby), we were particularly thrilled to see this historic landmark refurbished and the architecture and style respected. We strolled around the grounds a bit and I have to say this would make a great stay-cation and was certainly a great place to come for brunch."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour! I loved the tacos and the mild Asian wing. I also had the sazerac which very good! My husband has the cucumber fresh and loved it!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe how much I do love this place. So wonderful it is. I feel like I am back in my childhood. Back to the early 60's. High end and living it up. The Decor is perfect! Every detail is Retro. The table is set old school. Just perfect. The Hotel itself is mid century modern.  But, original.  They should of done an episode for Mad Men here. Maybe they did!  We came here for my friends Birthday. Our food was magnificent, the service was wonderful, and the atmosphere was so cool it was hot!   Love this place. If I could eat here once a week I would. They even Valet your car. Love it!  All 4 of us loved our drinks. A gorgeous mint Lemonade, I was served Green Tea that was almost too beautiful to try. Plus, it was a great day outside. We dined inside but, they had the Patio open and it was wonderful. Since it was my friends Birthday, they treated him to a wonderful Chocolate Pie! It was so Good. We ordered one as well. It was delish and tasted very real."}
{"text":"We had an overall wonderful experience at Zuzu during restaurant week.  We had eaten here before but had been years and the new menu was quite enticing.  I had the vegetarian pasta which was light and had great flavors.  Two people also had the steak and said it was amazing.  And the 4th had the salmon which I also tasted and was wonderful.  The lemon meringue and chocolate cake desserts were very good. Amanda was our server - top notch customer service.  We also had 2 managers stop by our table who were very friendly and just checking on us.  It was a beautiful evening so we were able to enjoy their patio.  The best part was when one of the chefs from the kitchen, Tony, came out to check on us.  Overall great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing. The Martinis were fabulous, if the weather is good absolutely sit outside.  You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"What a fun place! We really liked the retro decor! The food was really good! Loved the Mimosa and Bloody Mary bar. It was busy and clearly a hip crowd staying there."}
{"text":"I frequent the Hotel Valley Ho Spa on average 15 times per year. I like to make a day of it.  After 3 downhill lunches at this last stop, I decided to update my review. Zuzu continues to blame the opening of their new hotel Mountain Shadows on the low performing, unorganized food coming out of the ktchen. Waited 15 minutes for a flat glass of champagne. Last visit ordered brunch California eggs benedict. It literally looked like they tossed the kitchen sink on it. Awful presentation. The muffin, which they are supposed to make scratch was small and tasteless, the butter sauce was swimming the plate the avacado was not sliced, but hunked on and cooled the eggs and entire dish. The side potatoes were burned and greasy. The waitor brought me new and it was deep fried.  Just aweful. Tried the roasted beet side dish and just like the Eggs Benedict it was over salted and a bit strange as it was hot from oven and all goat cheese gooey.  For a day at the spa with the extra treat of dining out...yesterday was my last dining tab with Zuzu. Again, this review describes this last meal, but reflects the last four  to six months of downhill performance and product.  Also, Hotel Valley Ho itself is looking a bit tattered too. To me, everything is slipping because of new focus on their Mountain Shadows Resort. I think this is a mistake and a huge business oversite. This place used to be great. The staff though is always friendly and prifessional. This food is now acceptable as roadside diner fare you might grab touring.  My expectation is much higher... kind of like their cocktail prices, which still settles around 11 to 15 dollars.  Before I would never mention because the food used to rock. Pains me to write this, but I have been giving staff feedback for about 6 months now. My spa days are officially getting shorter  because of yesterday's meal.  I will not be dining at Zuzu any longer. Final note to management. The menu Items have not changed. The menu is stagnant and has been since I wrote my first wish for rotating fare but gave high accolades years ago. I am not in the hotel industry, but one busy resort shouldn't have to suffer due to expansion of building another.  I am sad that my spa days will be shorter. It might even prompt me to find a new spot for massage and nails now as I like to make a refuge out of my day and to do that..I need to dine."}
{"text":"We girlfriend and I had dinner and breakfast here the next day. The food was wonderful, service was great. The cocktails steal the show. Very good. I had and old fashioned which was top notch and my friend had a delicious bloody mary. Wasn't cheap but worth the money."}
{"text":"I went in for brunch 2 week's ago and cannot stop thinking about the amazing menu offered.    They offer a great variety that include some of you traditional breakfast items as well some fun creative dishes.  I tried nearly everything in the menu and loved it all!!  The cinnamon rolls are filled with a gooey,creamy,sugary, buttery glaze in the middle.  Kill me now.  My life is complete.    The Chia seed pudding is ridiculous yummy and super healthy. Scones, yes.  Chicken and waffles, yes.  Deviled egg omelet,  yes.  Should you dine there today for brunch? Yes :) ask for Leila she's a sweetheart."}
{"text":"I had dinner last night and it was delicious! They bring out these awesome parker house rolls which are warm and delicious! We ate inside and the ambiance was very nice, they also have a great patio to sit on with a fire place lit during the evening. I had their special, which was the beef tenderloin with mashed potatoes and asparagus with some type of a demi glaze sauce. My friend had the Gala Burger and that thing was on point! The meat was delicious with the bacon jam and arugula made it tasty! We had Kate as our server and she is so nice and friendly! Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"This review is just based on our dinner experience.  The food was really good but the service was really bad!  I think our server was totally out of it because he made several mistakes with our meals.  Anyways.... the actual meals tasted good but I wouldn't go back for dinner.  My friends went there for breakfast, though, and had a great meal, so next time I'm there I think I'll try the breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I live in Old Town and Zuzu is our local go-to bar/restaurant. My very favorite drink EVER is their Strawberry Basil En Fuego - perfect every time! The food is awesome, I love the groovy retro feel, wait staff is very attentive and now this is our favorite place to take our friends! Who would have thought our favorite place in town would be a hotel restaurant! We even swing by for breakfast some times too! Last night we took friends there for drinks and apps, then took our 2nd round of drinks outside and up to the balcony overlooking the pool and grounds. Totally cool!"}
{"text":"Best service we had in a long time! Kimberly took great care of us and always kept our coffee cup full. Highly recommend the Denver omelette and eggs Benedict for breakfast. Only complaint was the bacon tasted more like beef jerky. Overall this hotel is on the top of our lists for exceptional customer service."}
{"text":"Beautiful retro inspired atmosphere with a comforting yet playful menu.  Outstanding items include the pork chop, grilled salmon salad, and seared ahi salad. I've been here almost a dozen times over the past year and each time, the dishes are fresh and well prepared. The lunchtime wait staff tends to be a lot of new employees in training (or at least that's what I observed), but the service is still acceptable despite of this."}
{"text":"Price code should be at least $$$. $12 for a weak drink! Too pricey for what you get. Happy Hour menu may be the way to go unless you're on an expense account or a hi-roller."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and you will find a romantic setting if you come for dinner! I'm giving ZuZu's 3 stars for the less-than-awesome service.   But last week when we stayed at Hotel Valley Ho and ate at ZuZu's (once for dinner, once for breakfast) it was not amazing.   Our waitress talked to us in a very condescending manner--she was much older, and it felt like she was talking down to me and my husband because of our age (we're in our 20s, and have been treated poorly at nicer places before in and around Scottsdale). It was super bizarre, and after dinner, I finally asked my husband if he felt the same way. Sure enough, he did. Next morning, a different waitress is rude and doesn't even offer to bring us coffee when we sit down. We had to ask her for coffee when she wanted to take our breakfast order.   Don't get me wrong, ZuZu's is definitely worth checking out if you are in the area or if you are staying at Hotel Valley Ho! I mean, the vintage-meets-modern decor drawn from the original property is so lovely and rich with history, and the menu is great with delicious food!"}
{"text":"Had to return to Valley Ho and Zuzus for another time.  Their chef is simply outrageously good.  The cheesy grits are so delicious,  reminiscent of grits in Charleston.  Eggs were poached to perfect and the house made English muffin..... Yum mm."}
{"text":"This review is for happy hour and it's very solid. Everything is $3 from 4-7. Three of us took down four drinks each and 4 apps and it was $50. Not bad at all. The Brie grilled sandwich was pretty outstanding and so were the wings. The French dip was mediocre, but hard to beat for $3. the margaritas were light and very good- tequila, agave, lime juice - better than most places! Definitely one of the best happy hours in town for food and drinks and service."}
{"text":"ZuZu has the happiest hour on earth from 5 - 7 (Monday through Friday). Sip on a hot and dirty martini for $3 with the Zombies as your soundtrack and take in the retro-sheik surroundings. Then cool down with the bramble (something yum involving lemon juice, blueberry and gin). The cheese plate and spinach artichoke dip are both a-m-a-z-i-n-g and will help you keep happy hour from becoming hammered hour. It's a must-do for reals."}
{"text":"Great eatery inside the Valley Ho hotel. Their prime rib hash on the breakfast menu was delicious. The perfect send off before catching our flight back home. Love the feel and vibe of this place. Love their service and convenient location (for hotel guests at least). Love their hours and menu items. Oh, and love that their orange juice is called the HO-J. Right?!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, our server was excellent and the lounge has a hip trendy ambience! Had the grilled cheese, tofu dish, asparagus, chopped salad topped with martinis...all of them were very excellent...highly recommend. This is in old town and nice place to get away from the summer heat."}
{"text":"I hope the food is good. I don't know if I'll ever get to taste it. The place is empty... I waited 20 minutes for their famous Ho J just to hear they were \"out of the ingredients\". Now, back to my eternal wait for our food. Oh, and my wife has asked for sugar for her coffee... 4 times! Disaster."}
{"text":"A nice space for a quick drink or nibble.  I stopped by here a few times during my time at Valley Ho and it was fine. I tried a couple of local beers here, unfortunately neither was really impressive, but the chips with guac and salsa were really fantastic! The chips were freshly made (although so hot we burned our fingers a bit!) and the dips were very flavourful.   The service was reasonable, and the space has a very cool, retro-chic vibe to it. I'll be back next time I'm at Valley Ho, not because it's the best bar I've ever been to, but because it's convenient, reasonably priced, and the atmosphere is pretty darn good for a hotel bar!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with brunch here. We sit at the bar and have always had really great service. I love the BLT and my other half gets the Lox and Bagel plate every time. He loves it. They also do a build your own mimosa and bloody Mary bar."}
{"text":"It depresses me that I am so far away from this delicious and incredible restaurant.  I cam here for my bachelorette weekend (which I HIGHLY recommend!) and it was just fabulous.  We came throughout the weekend for snacks, drinks, lunch, breakfast and dinner (sounds a lot but there was a really good variety) and everyone was really nice.  The food - mmm the food!  Definitely stop by for their mimosas and you-make-it bloody mary (which was my first time!) great selection and you can make your own.  For dinner, I had the gnocchi app as an entree and it was delicious, decadent, luxurious and creamy - my favorite!  If you are visiting, living or in the mood for fresh delicious cuisine you must try Zuzu."}
{"text":"Cool: Funky retro furniture that looks like it could be  from the 60s. Not cool: Furniture that is so dirty it actually LOOKS like it's from the 60s and has been sitting in my parent's basement for two decades. Cafe Zuzu -- clean your freaking booths.  The first thing I noticed after sitting down here this morning was that the brown polyester upholstery on my chair was stained with -- milk? And then, looking around,  I noticed the walls of many of the booths (same fabric) were also stained. The carpets were full of crumbs and food, too. That's what I expect from I-Hop, not the Valley Ho.  My husband and I ate here for Easter brunch, but were overall disappointed. The menu? boring. The prices? OK, but a bit high for what you're getting. The service? Slow. The decor? Very cool. I'll admit, I enjoyed sitting in the cafe with glass walls that were open to the pool and the cool decorations. But that was about it. The menu was all things like \"Denver omelet\" \"bacon and mushroom omelet\" \"scrambled eggs with grits\" \"pancakes\" -- what is this, a breakfast join in Fargo or something? Really, that's the best you can do?  I really wanted french toast, but the only option Zuzu offered was \"cranberry and walnut\" - which seemed a little seasonal. As in, NOT the springtime season. So I settled for the eggs and grits. The grits were really good. The eggs were... well... scrambled eggs. They were fine, and all, pretty tasty -- but that's it.  I guess I just expected something more.  I was under the impression that this place was supposed to put a  \"twist\" on the typical \"comfort foods\" -- but they seemed to forget to add the twist. I could have had a far more creative brunch at home."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the futuristic Jetsons style layout of this place.  I ordered the egg sandwich on a bagel.  The food came out quickly and to be honest that egg sandwich was so ginormous i couldn't finish it.  The staff was very friendly and helpful and we were able to charge the breakfast to our room.  I felt like a rockstar.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Another outstanding breakfast with superb service! Eddie was our waiter and his attention to detail is what I like to see. To top it off, I won a dessert for checking in!!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  I had breakfast, lunch and dinner and not one bad meal.  The miso glazed tofu dish is amazing and I highly suggest it.   The truffled grilled cheese amazing as well. The strozapetti pasta deeeeeeliiiiisssssshhhhh. The seared ahi salad yum.  And, if you are there for happy hour don't miss the pickled vegetable tostada.  It is absolutely delicious and super light!  Great appetizer!  Service is great, décor is great.   This is truly a five star restaurant in my book!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed staying at the Valley Ho and hanging out at the bar in Zuzu. Great staff, sweet happy hour, properly made cocktails. Had the Korean wings with a side of ghost pepper sauce and the poutine. Both were delicious af. Had my first sazerac drink ($6 on happy hour) and it was amazing. I also had breakfast in the morning at the restaurant and it was also delicious. Well done, will be back!"}
{"text":"Cafe Zuzu has undergone a huge and glorious menu change by a new chef. I was so happy to be able to try out their menu and some of my favorites were the lobster risotto, Scottish salmon the Show Stopper shake and the Ho-nut on the dessert menu. Their signature cocktails are creative and always diverse, there is something for everyone. I really enjoy that the menu is classified into different options now for breakfast/brunch, lunch and dinner. I'm excited to see where this restaurant goes and also to try all the delicious creations ahead. If you have ever tried cafe zuzu before the last 5 months and were disappointed, you should definitely come back and give it a second shot! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"It's the most wonderful time of the year! Not only is the weather FINALLY cooling down but it's also the return of Restaurant Week. One of my friend's had chosen Zuzu for a group of us to dine at together. First, notably was the ambiance of this restaurant; we had gone in at around 7:00pm on Saturday night. It was super casual and although we had a reservation, it wasn't too busy yet at the restaurant. At around 8:00pm, they started live music which was being played far enough away from the restaurant so it wasn't too loud but definitely added to the overall relaxing vibe.  Onto the food itself, we all decided to go with the Restaurant Week special. Two of us got the Butternut Squash Raviolo, one got the Blue Hill Bay Mussels, and another got the Kale + Brussels Sprouts Caesar. All of us seemed to enjoy our appetizers! I personally really liked the Butternut Squash Raviolo; it was a good size, had a tasty filling with a light sage butter sauce, and a little bit of crunch from the pumpkin seed + pecan brittle.  For our entrees, I got the Mushroom, Fennel + Goat Cheese Tart per recommendation of our server. It was a tasty option especially since it was vegetarian. The tart was tasty with the creamy goat cheese, mushrooms, and lemon + chive butter with frisée on top. Since this was part of a 3-course meal, it was fine but the entree alone wasn't very filling. Others got the Manhattan Filet Steak and Hokkaido Scallops, which looked good and they seemed to like it.  Lastly, for dessert, three of us got Peanut Butter Cheesecake and one got the Praline Panna Cotta. The Peanut Butter Cheesecake was really really good! The cheesecake itself was creamy and definitely tasted peanut butter-y! The topping of lime gelee was interesting as it added a bit of lightness, plus there was also some crunch from the toasted peanut crumble!  The service the entire evening was also good. It did take a little bit of time for each course to come out, so I'd give myself ample time for dinner. Overall, a good experience, I'm likely to return."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! The server was amazing also! My fiancé and I come here every year for our anniversary and will never stop."}
{"text":"Worst $12 chicken sandwich. EVER.  I'd give them one star, but I feel like I need to throw in one more, just because the decor was beautiful, and the weather was great on the patio. They caught me in a good mood.  We accidentally wandered in during brunch. We had already eaten breakfast, so we were in a tough spot. However, the waitron was kind enough to offer up some lunch menus. Good on her.   It was also nice of her to bring the flavored syrup for my soda separately. Now if only she'd brought the check in a timely manner when we were done.  I ended up ordering something off the brunch menu anyway -- a grilled chicken sandwich. Supposedly, it's topped with brie and arugula, dressed in a bacon dressing, and served on brioche.   Someone must've forgotten to place their Sysco order. Because, my sandwich was topped with cream cheese with some brie rind mixed in, and spinach. There were some cold pieces of bacon fat in there, that may indicate some sort of dressing.  The chicken itself was moist, but completely flavorless.The brioche had potential, but somehow it got soggy and gross.  Bleagh. I hate to say it, but I could have gotten a better chicken sandwich at Applebee's for $7.95."}
{"text":"This is an great spot for grabbing a late breakfast before hitting the pool at Valley Ho.  I had the red velvet waffles which were really good.  I'm sure when weather is good (it was cloudy and rainy) this place is jumpin before all the fun starts at the pool.  I'll give it another shot in the near future."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere and that they allowed me to make a reservation. Their happy hour drinks are a good price, beer is probably over priced. The food happy hour menu is nothing special. Their appetizers on the regular dinner menu were really good but a little too pricey. I would probably only return for a quick drink at the bar with a friend. The strawberry lemonade was good."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here after staying at Hotel Valley Ho once.  The server was friendly, and the food was simple yet delicious.  Normally, I'm known to write longer reviews, but this time, just go to Cafe ZuZu, and you'll thank me afterward."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times while bar hopping with the Rage Cycles folk. We tend to be dressed ridiculously but there are all kinds at ZuZu. It has the kind of atmosphere where you can get dressed up just because or walk in casually. The bar always has a delicious drink specials and the prices are comparable to other places around town. ZuZu is actually inexpensive compared to other \"fancy\" looking restaurants/bars.   In all honesty, I have never eaten here but I've nibbled off of peoples' plates and the food is great if you're looking for bar food with a little flare.   ZuZu is a great spot to meet a small group or date. Highly recommended! And it's close to old town, which makes it easy to hop around to other desirable spots."}
{"text":"Wow what a great meal , planned to go to old town for dinner , glad I stayed at the Valley Ho ,. Had awesome scallops with deep fried lemons , perfectly cooked , arugula salad loaded with walnuts , Beets and Feta  , what a great meal , highly recommend this place and the Valley Ho  Is just a hip and funky hotel elite great rooms and staff"}
{"text":"We had stayed at the hotel, but never ate in the restaurant. Boy was that a mistake!  This place is awesome and so is our server, Patrick."}
{"text":"I met a client last week at Cafe ZuZu's lounge and had a wonderful meeting. My server Nicolas Ray was very attentive and brought us water and some bread. He checked back a few times and refilled out waters. An excellent place to have a business meeting. Very professional servers and the atmosphere was inspiring!"}
{"text":"A must for happy hour. Great deals on unique drinks and delicious appetizers... try the grilled cheese!!!!!!  cool vibe and good looking 30-50 year olds flock here."}
{"text":"My wife and I have stayed at the hotel a couple of times and really enjoyed the zu zu restaurant.  However this trip the service was lacking and kitchen kept getting backed up. In fact our breakfast took well over an hour to be delivered.  Our server never let us know that the kitchen was slow and we were left hanging.  After several complaints to mgmt we did get our breakfast comped which was the right thing for them to do.  Not sure if they have new staff or what cause we have had good experiences before.  I just hope that they get it figured out!"}
{"text":"Beautiful evening for dinner on the patio at Cafe ZuZu. And a really good value considering it was AZ Restaurant Week.   Half price bottle of champagne got us off to a great start. First courses -- Wagyu Beef was perfectly tender and flavorful. The roasted acorn squash soup was excellent as well, with the cinnamon toasted marshmallows an awesome creative twist.   We both had the mustard crusted NY strip -- tender and tasty, but the star for me was the truffle mashed potatoes.   The Decadent Chocolate Torte was in fact decadent, an excellent end to an excellent meal.   My only suggestion is they need to up their game on the dinner rolls, but that was a minor infraction. All in all, a beautiful and romantic setting for a terrific meal."}
{"text":"During my 2 1/2 days in Phoenix at the Valley Ho I visited their restaurant twice. Once for drinks and once for brunch...  While we were there for drinks several of the Halloween themed martinis were calling my name, but I settled on a glass of Cakebread Sauvignon Blanc instead.  And it was perfect.  Gabi K and I considered staying for dinner, but Jared M didn't seem too thrilled with his pasta from there (even though he polished it off) so we decided to go elsewhere.  2 days later we were back at Cafe ZuZu for brunch.  This time the choice of what to order wasn't so easy! Wheat pancakes or homemade granola and fruit?? Decisions, decisions. Fortunately, our uhmazing waitress (wish I could remember her name to give her props) made the decision for me.  She offered to split the homemade granola, wheat pancakes and even a side of scrambled eggs among Gabi and I.  As our food came I had to take a call and when I finally returned to the table my eggs and pancakes were cold. Gabi mentioned that the fabulous waitress did offer to keep them warm for me, but she wasn't sure how long I'd be gone.   Everything was still tasty though- even when cold!  A fine option for those staying a the Valley Ho and even a good spot for locals to stop by.."}
{"text":"My experience with Christmas brunch this year was a disaster from the start:  1) We called to make reservations at Zuzu a couple days before Christmas. When we arrived they booked us as a reservation under the Sands Buffet and were pushy in convincing us to go there. After refusing they finally allowed us to seat at zuzu, which I don't know why was a problem bc it clearly looked like there was space for us at zuzu.  2) The waiter brought out coffee and juice and spilled it on my cousin.. then after waiting forever for the mimosas and bloody Marys the we ordered, he spilled mimosa all over my friend's cashmere sweater.   3) Items from our order were missing, incorrect, or took forever to get. We were never offered refills on coffee or water unless we specifically asked for it.   4) I agree with other users the food was a hit or miss. My cousin had the best meal out of all of us dining.... he had a lox bagel, kinda hard to mess up. But everyone had said that the best part of their meal was the toast.  Also, I got the pork chilequile special and they basically dumped sauce on top of a tortilla chip and added an over easy egg, there was no evidence of pork at all so I politely sent that back. By the time I got a new entree I just had them box it up bc everyone else in my party had already finished whatever they could stomach from their meal that was not awful.   5) Instead of serving us the waiter was too lazy to walk around and place drinks or meals in front of us. He literally was on the other side of the table and reached across the table to give me my entree which I had to grab myself from across the table.  My family and I had Christmas brunch here in 2015 and we loved it so much that we decided to make a tradition out of it. After our experience this Christmas brunch we will definitely not be back.  Some of these issues were addressed with the manager who had provided us some compensation, which we appreciate, but definitely does not justify another visit to this establishment."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch experience yesterday! The food and presentation were out of this world. I had the California Benedict and my friends had the Valley Ho Breakfasts. I can't wait to go back. And the server MJ was \"real\". Made our experience the best in a long time. He even made the Bloody Mary from the make your own bar for us. Awesome!"}
{"text":"It's been two years, but this burger ($14) remains top of the line. Cooked well done and topped with a giant mound of high-end blue cheese it makes for a delicious eating experience. Every bite is chock full of the cheese, grilled onions and bacon and the brioche bun was also a great fit. Another person just subbed the blue for cheddar and also enjoyed her \"normal, not famous\" burger. On this day, the chips outclassed the upcharged fries, but not by a huge margin. You can still get a free dessert with check-in, but no cheesecake was available this visit. The strawberry shake was more milky than ice creamy, but still refreshing and free. Will be back more often now when in the burger mood."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Ho regularly since it reopened.  I frequent the bar, restaurant, spa, and/or pool area at least a few times a month - mostly for dinner or brunch.    The menu is mostly classic American fare set in a hip, relaxing environment.  The restaurant is perfect for any meal: breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, drinks, happy hour, special events- you name it, they got you covered.  Brunch: I'm not a morning drinker, but the Bloody Mary bar looks lavish - you could make a meal out of that spread!  To continue the indulgence, try the stuffed french toast or poached eggs benedict.  The cheesy grits are another guilty pleasure. Lighter appetites will love the breakfast parfait or sliced fruit plate.  The fruit is always fresh and beautifully displayed. On Sundays (I think...it's changed over the years), ZuZu provides complementary, fresh-baked scones with your meal.  Dinner: Like brunch, it's hard to go wrong.  Our fav's include the burgers, the chicken and penne, the artisan cheese plate, the orange and ginger crusted ahi, and the farm fresh veggie of the day (often I just order the veggie for dinner and steal fries from my BF).  The complementary dinner rolls are salty sirens of white bread goodness - take THAT you cruel, gluten-free world!    The ZuZu menu has evolved over time and for the better.  A few items we miss and would love to eat again include the happy hour BBQ spare ribs and the chocolate cupcake.  The service at ZuZu is impeccable.  My only minor criticism is the hostess asks me if I'm a guest at the hotel and for last name EVERY single time I visit the restaurant.  If you keep putting my last name into the computer, can't you see how many times I've been there?  I don't expect special treatment, but a simple \"good to see you again! \" would be cool.  The one exception is Esther, who works in the restaurant and always chats with us when we come in.  Those little gestures mean a lot.   Regardless we are TOTAL fans of Cafe ZuZu and the Valley Ho and recommend it highly to visitors and locals alike.  Thanks for making my neighborhood a better place!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, fabulous atmosphere! Went to Cafe Zuzu for Sunday brunch. The choices on the menu were so great it was really hard to decide what to order. The food was delicious and very reasonably priced. Our server was very attentive and made helpful suggestions. The Bloody Mary bar was great.  Lovely live music playing in the background. Fun 60s decor.  All-in-all, a fantastic dining experience!"}
{"text":"This has got to be the best hotel bar/restaurant ever!  The food is impressive, but not too fancy.  The drinks are creative and classic.  Great happy hour specials!  I love this place!  Never have I felt so comfortable in a hotel lounge area.  When I am relaxing with friends and enjoying my cocktail, I feel like I am in my best friend's (with great taste in mid-centruty decor) living room.  In that sense, it is the perfect accompaniment to or extension of our hotel room.  Truly a home away from home and still a special treat at the same time.  Truth be told, I may be slightly biased as my husband and I got married at HVH a few years ago, however, we have been back to enjoy ZuZu and to stay at the hotel several times and never have I been disappointed.  ZuZu is the perfect venue for hanging out, whether it is after the most perfect wedding reception on the rooftop or an early morning family brunch.  We typically sit in the bar/lounge area.  There or from the bar you can order from the full food menu.  Bloody Marys and breakfast, brunch, lunch, and late night snacks, we've had it all.  The dip on the HH menu is the best deal yet, and my favorite lunch (or light dinner) is the chopped salad with a side of mac'n cheese.  Hubby loves the ZuZu burger and gets it at least once every trip; a new tradition that started on our wedding night!  But that's another story . . ."}
{"text":"Having champagne taste but a Champagne of Beers budget is a real drag sometimes.   $15 mixed drinks can go kick rocks and $12 apps that feed one can take a flying leap. That's why I adore happy hour. Remember when Tempe Caffe Boa had a real, real good one? You got the hip but sophisticated atmosphere, great eats and drinks, and could walk away well-fed and pretty buzzed without having buyer's remorse the next day when you realized you spent your week's lunch money.  Well Café ZuZu you are the new mecca for my budget conscious but discernable palate. I have always adored my visits to Valley Ho - I'm a suck-suck-sucker for modern design and décor and a stroll over the grounds and through the lobby are like a Mad Men fan's dream: the cozy fireplace surrounded by couches for relaxing with your drink, the lounge-y area just outside the bar is intimate, comfy and gorgeous - appropriate for a date or a small gathering of friends -- the open layout means you can look from one end of the hotel to the other and all the way up to the third floor ceiling. The music was 60s lounge and energetic without killing the easy vibe. Oh, did I mention the $3 drinks and food menu?  This is really impressive. Three bucks a pop can get you a single serving of braised short ribs (juicy, tender and falling right off the bone), or some mini grilled cheese sandwiches of brie, green apple and fig jam (I'm a huge fan of Postino's prosciutto bruschetta, and this reminded me of that, the perfect blend of salty and sweet but even more buttery and savory, and with a hint of tart) or a decently sized prime rib sandwich w/ au jus...to name a few items. On the drinks side, I love the variety. Most HH mixed drink menus are all \"martinis\" that are neon green or hot pink and sickly sweet. Not here - get a refreshing Blackberry Bramble or Gin Fizz (that's two of six mixed drinks on special) or a glass of wine (about 4-5 choices) for just three dollars. I ate and drank to my delight and spent $15. Um, wow.   Service was great - friendly and competent and not at all weird about our ordering 2-3 drinks at a time to take advantage of the deal, or deciding to order yet another appetizer because they're just so damn cheap.  Oh ZuZu, thank you! Every pauper wants to feel like a princess, five times a week, from 4-7."}
{"text":"5 STAR! 5 STAR! 5 STAR! Wow... What else can I say? If you haven't been to Cafe ZuZu - what are you waiting for? I was sorry it took me so long to get there!!  The amazing, talented Chef Sean created wonders on a plate... Seared Ahi - Delicious Truffled Grilled Cheese - Outstanding Asian Pear Salad - Perfection (That was course #1) Brussel Sprouts Au Gratin - Mmmmm Crab Cakes over Cheesy Grits - Speechless Lamb Sausage - Oh so good Mussels - Seriously the BEST I've ever had (anywhere)!!  (That was course #2) Tropical Iced Tea w/Fresh Mint & a side of Simple Syrup -  Refreshing (Could not fit another course in... will have to go back for dessert!)  Well, enough about the food, let's move on to the atmosphere. Very cool, very chic, very retro (50's). We could not stop thinking & talking of ideas on how to bring more people here, i.e., family, friends, large gatherings, work parties, etc. We want to share the feeling & the fabulous food we enjoyed here. Not to mention, they try to source local, have fresh herb garden right outside the kitchens back door, and mostly made from scratch! The service was personable & friendly! And we hear they have a great happy hour during the week, which we will definitely be back for!  The team that put life back into the Hotel Valley Ho & Cafe ZuZu is genius! The place is simply impressive. A gem tucked away that should be admired, enjoyed & taken to the next level!   GO NOW! =)"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at ZuZu for Sunday morning brunch as part of a group of eight that meets at a different restaurant every month. We've been doing this for about 14 years. In recent times, places are very happy to provide separate checks. It seems that restaurant software has made great strides, so that it isn't much work to separate the checks. It wasn't always this way, so we appreciate it when it happens.  Well, at ZuZu it was like the old days. Our server said that he couldn't give us separate checks, but that he would take separate forms of payment. We've been to other places where they didn't separate the check, but gave each person or pair the total with the tax and tip included. This person just told us to give him payment, and tell him how much we wanted him to charge.   It felt like the restaurant management's attitude was, \"It is too much trouble for us to do the math for you. You should be happy that we cook the food and serve it on the same day you order it. Our food is so good, and we are so cool, how could you expect more?\"  It seems like this whole review is about money. That may be because we felt that there wasn't much to say about the food. I had the Eggs Benedict, which were small both in size and in taste. The grits, even after I added butter and salt, tasted like rice pudding with no sugar. Different, and uninteresting. My wife had blue corn pancakes, most of which is still sitting in our fridge. To be fair, the scones were wonderful.  It seemed that the food took a long time to come out, which became a topic of conversation in our group, most of whom don't usually complain about such things. The mandatory gratuity they added because of our big party was 20%. Most often, if there is gratuity added at all, it is 18%. For that extra 2%, how about separate checks?  So, while we enjoyed the mid-century chic ambiance, we were not impressed with our visit to ZuZu. We do appreciate how quickly they refunded the amount that we were overcharged when we called back a couple of hours later. That was nice of them."}
{"text":"Such a cool restaurant tucked in one of the coolest historic hotels in Scottsdale!   I went for lunch and the menu wasn't super big but they have some really great options. We started with the hummus plate and it came with warm pita and vegetables- very good.   I ended up going with the soup and salad which came with the gem Salad (bacon, avocado, cucumber, tomato) and a carrot sweet potato soup. The soup was amazing! Such a unique mix of flavors in a rich soup!   I would highly recommend zuzu!"}
{"text":"The food is above average. I ate breakfast consisting of a denver omelet. I went there again for lunch and got the zuzu burger. The burger was a little heavy and greasy, but good. The service could have been better both times. They were slow to bring me my bill the first time and they were slow with service overall tge second time. They were not even that busy. It is convenient though being on the property and worth going to especially if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"my wifes company has their Christmas party here at the hotel. They were amazing they dedicated an area in front by the fire pit and brought us some amazing cocktails not entirely happy about their version of A old fashioned. But the experience in the atmosphere was very classy. At dinner service was good we had a huge table of 14 people. Beef barley vegetable soup was very hearty and delicious. The Cornish game hen the way it was prepared was excellent and for dessert I had the lemon meringue tart that was amazing I pretty much ate the whole thing."}
{"text":"Our server was the nicest girl and she was really accommodating for us, she adjusted all of the umbrellas to make sure we were in the shade and she offered to take a picture of our group. All of the food was delicious and came out really fast! I got a milkshake called a Ho-J, it is like a orange creamy shake-heaven in a cup. Everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"What a great happy hour!  We tried the green chili pork which was delish, we couldn't stop eating it until it was gone!  The bartender recommended that we try the mac n cheese because the chef had won an award for it.  It was really good as well but I am a big fan of the green chili pork.  I will def be back!"}
{"text":"We live in the area and have always loved ZuZU. So great happy hour goes til 7:00 during the week, and Valley Ho is just a neat place. They've recently changed things up. Only \"parts\" of the patio are eligible for happy hour, the happy hour food menu has been drastically cut back. The beer selections on HH were cut back.  Wine is red or white. Pick one. The food is always good, but just let down by the recent changes. Not enough to draw us to HH there any more."}
{"text":"Instructions for a \"funtabulous\" happy hour in Scottsdale:   1. Go to Cafe Zuzu.  2. Have the delightful Lacey be your server.  3. Order any of the speciality cocktails on the $3 happy hour menu.  3A. In particular order the Bourbon Smash and Bramble!  4. Order a couple of noshes off the happy hour menu or even a \"supplementary\" item off the lounge menu.  4A. In particular order the barbecue mini pork shanks, the grilled artisan cheese mini sandwiches and the apple, endive, pomegranate salad.  5. Enjoy people watching in the crowded bar that magically empties out as 7:00p (the end of happy hour) approaches.   If you are visiting Scottsdale, as we are, and are not regulars at Cafe Zuzu, here are a couple of tips that might be helpful for you before you go to Zuzu.   First, web site ad aside that shows a young woman sitting with legs and dress askew, have no worries...you will not be offered a lap dance with your cocktails. (Although, my husband who wondered if this might be so based on the marketing photo on the web site may have been a tad disappointed. ;-) )   Second, you do not have to use the Valet parking at the Valley Ho to get into Zuzu. Self parking is available around the side of the building, a little hard to find but it's there.   Third, yes you really ARE going the right direction from the gate at the parking lot in the long walk through a sort of dark \"tunnel\" of buildings to get to the pool area of the Valley Ho where ZuZu is located...trek on intrepid traveler.   Last, if there is seating outside (not on the night we were there due to inclement weather) it looks as if that could be as much fun as was the inside seating! Even for those of us who are...ahem...more \"mature\" happy hour fans for whom the retro design at the Valley Ho and Zuzu reminds us of our childhood.  (And remember, all those younger people have to go to WORK the next day and we are blissfully retired. :-) )"}
{"text":"Nestled in the beautiful Hotel Valley Ho, Cafe ZuZu seemingly has everything going for it.  The layout and decor is just outstanding, with uber-modern details abound.  I really liked the look of the menu which contained everything from signature dishes to old favorites.  Our service was pretty great, also.  But everything smells awful.  OK, maybe not everything, but our plate of mushroom grits (better in idea than reality) and my ZuZu burger reeked to high heaven.  I'm being completely serious when I say that I would hesitate to ever visit again based on this factor alone.  Clearly, I'm never ordering either item again, but now it seems like one big crap shoot.  It doesn't help that the burger tasted awful, too.  Our waitress gladly took it back for a replacement which came promptly.  Replacing their terrible, caked-on bleu cheese with cheddar was the best decision of the night.  Still, my backup burger came complete with a scorched bun, an obvious consequence of the rush.  I guess it could be worse.  They could have charged me for that awful burger I ordered and the mushroom grits could have smelled more like vomit.  Still, my expectations were so high and I left totally bummed out."}
{"text":"I've been to the bar twice in the past two weeks, just for a drink, so my review is of those experiences only. I cannot comment on the food. Both times I arrive at the bar and have a seat and there are multiple associates behind the bar that continue about their business and do not give us the time of day. Finally, after way too long, catching someones attention for a drink menu and then again, we wait for them to come back to take our order.  It was so bad it almost felt like we were being avoided/ignored. I don't smell. At least I don't think so...Maybe time for a new deodorant.  The consistency in lazy service is why only 3-stars."}
{"text":"You have got to be kidding-the menu is a joke. Beef stroganoff in the middle of August? Has anyone ever heard of a seasonal menu? We walked in, the bartender just stared at us. The host then appeared, oh hi! Our poor waitress... The whole experience was a scene from a bad movie. It did fall in line with a lot of the bad reviews we read. We could not leave fast enough. Highlight might be the bread basket. My shrimp tasted like cheap booze. Awful Awful....."}
{"text":"We were a group of 4 sharing several small plates. My rank order would be 1 burrata, 2 beets, 3 cucumbers, 4 himachi, 5 dates, 6 lobster roll. Service was a touch slow."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in the valley for happy hour! The midcentury modern ambiance is sure to brighten anyone's day! Their large, open patio is perfect during spring or fall. They have delicious food and drink specials for $6 and under. The menu changes pretty regularly but some of my favorites have been the Green Chile Pork, House Made Potato Chips & the Slow Roasted Ribeye Dip {amazing!} For cocktails, The Bramble and Red Sangria are my top picks! The best part? It goes until 7pm so if your work day runs a little longer than expected, you don't have to rush!"}
{"text":"Very cool bar in a equally cool hotel that is very retro and chic. Looks like you are stepping back into the 50's ... I kept waiting for the Rat Pack to walk in :)  Had the Negroni which I didn't like but that has to do with my personal tastes versus the bar itself as my friend said they were excellent. Very professional and friendly bar staff.   One of the coolest if not the coolest bars in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to ZuZu at the Hotel Valley Ho in awhile you've got to come back! Chef Tony is amazing!"}
{"text":"The service and quality of food were fantastic all while at an affordable price point.  I would recommend coming here with a group and sampling the shared plates (pasta hands down and green chili mac & cheese)"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best breakfasts I've ever had....you have to check out this place. Our waitres (Susan I think) was a nice older lady who lovingly referred to everything on the menu as her's...\"I have the best coffee in town, I only use organic local ingredients\", it was super endearing.  Fresh squeezed OJ that gets REFILLED...yum. Awesome coffee..and HOMEMADE jam that they make in house...seriously heaven. I went there both days that I was in Scottsdale, it was that good. Can't wait to go back to Cafe Zuzu's"}
{"text":"Went to Zuzu to try their Showstopper Shake.  According to their social media postings, the share was available daily after 2:00.  We got their at 2:30 and they were confused that we had an OpenTable reservation since they said they don't take reservations in the afternoon and they weren't serving regular menu (huh?).  Didn't matter, there was plenty of seating outside, the weather was beautiful, and the lounge (bar) menu had sandwiches and apps, plus drinks, so plenty to eat.    We asked for the shake first, in case it was too filling and we couldn't eat lunch after.  The waitress came back and said the chef couldn't make the shake at that time.  What??  Since that was the whole purpose of our visit, I suggested to my husband that we leave, but he said we should stay since we were already there.  We ordered sandwiches.  Shortly after the waitress returned and told us the pastry chef COULD make us a shake (um, ok) so we ordered one.    The shake was amazing - definitely needs to be shared but presentation was gorgeous and it tasted yummy (we were there in Feb 2018 and shake was red velvet cupcake with cream cheese milkshake).  Not long after our shake was brought out, our sandwiches were served (really too close together).  Sandwiches were really good - I had California Turkey BLT and my husband had the burger; we both enjoyed our sandwiches.  Chips served with sandwiches were especially tasty!    Next time I will call to confirm when we can order the shake and we will order and enjoy that first and then see if we really want (can fit) lunch.  Our waitress was good but I feel like the timing of food could be improved."}
{"text":"First let me say.. Beautiful place, ambiance was out of this world, music and atmosphere was on point.. But this is a Restaurant.. And it started off good.. Great Cocktails!! Rolls came .. Ok Menu was Hmmm only like five six Entrees.. So not much of a selection..I decided try something different not a steak.. Oh was I disappointed.. Half Chicken no seasoning , the tomato something at bottom tasted like tomato soup and a waste of good hazel nuts thrown in with one small onion and Im not sure what else.. Husbands scallops over cooked and his risotto I think he said literally he was removing 1/3 of it because it was burnt.. I dont like sending dishes back because you just never know..Our waitress was great.. But Menu needs an updo.."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and service by Eddie was fantastic! Thank you ZuZu for a great day!"}
{"text":"The Valley Ho is one of my favorite hotels here. It has a lot of history (going back to the 50's) and a very unique look and feel to it. I was a regular at Trader Vic's before they closed. This was my first experience at ZuZu. I enjoyed a nice quiet dinner over a Moscow Mule and their popular ZuZu burger. The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. I love the outdoor seating area and the inside modern decor is just as amazing with all the colors and uniqueness it brings."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch. Sad they got rid of the short rib hash, but still tasty creative takes on classic American breakfast favourites."}
{"text":"Best Thanksgiving dinner in Scottsdale.  On Thanksgiving, I like traditional Thanksgiving dinner - not filet if halibut stuffed with carp.   Also,  great comfort food - chicken noodle soup is the best.  Dinner is very good from traditional to more inventive dishes.  Great service , friendly people."}
{"text":"It's a little off. Everything you think should be familiar and delicious, has a little mediocre twist on it.  I've had two seeming easy to execute meals that turned out not quite right.   First: a rib eye. How could this possibly be messed up? Easy... it's flap meat. What's that? The fatty part of the rib eye. I personally think they cooked a flat iron by mistake and told me that to avoid cooking what I actually ordered. Paying $6 for a side of mashed potatoes is kind of gratuitous   Second is probably the most egregious, over cooking the eggs on my eggs Benedict. Hard as rocks and almost no Hollandaise sauce. Dry as a bone.  The breakfast potatoes were inedible due to paprika over use.   Service was friendly.  Atmosphere is fun and fancy.   I also had a version of a Moscow mule which was delicious.   The appetizers that we tried were a cheese plate, which had good cheeses. But also we had a sausage plate, which had some gross and grainy sausage."}
{"text":"If you're searching Yelp right now trying to find a place to grab brunch, look no further! Come to ZuZu! You'll dine in mid-century modern style, be entertained by live music, enjoy the outdoor patio and feel like you're on vacation on some tropical island somewhere.   Once you're seated, you'll enjoy warm, complimentary chocolate chip scones, and they are SO good! The chocolate is all melty and I'm pretty sure I tasted a hint of cherry in there. We ordered coffee and champagne because, why not?! The coffee was VERY strong and I only ended up drinking about a half of my cup. We sprung for the Moet vintage rose which was de-lish!   Even though the menu is very concise, it was very difficult for me to choose what to order. Everything looked so good! I settled on the Eggs Benedict and opted for the cheese grits. The bene was cooked perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was amazing. But, those cheese grits were to die for! And I'm not typically a grits kind of girl.   Our service was just alright. We think our server had our table, which was located at the very back of the dining room by the kitchen, as well as some tables all the way out on the front of the patio, so sometimes she would be around, but mostly, she was not. Also, as she was pouring the last of our champagne, she poured the entire remains in to one person's glass, instead of splitting it evenly among the three of us (like you're supposed to) and claimed that the bottle was so heavy she didn't realize it was almost gone. Rookie move. And definitely frustrating since we forked out quite a bit of dough for that bottle.  I definitely hope to come back to ZuZu the next time I'm in town, though!"}
{"text":"Excellent room service in 30 mins or less both times we ordered!  Had the famous Zu burger and a Salad the night we arrived at the Ho and then an Omelette and the Stuffed Berry French Toast a couple days later for breakfast.  Everything was delicious and of the appropriate temperature upon arrival... Visited the Bar for a night cap a couple nights of our stay and could not say anything better about all the staff at this joint!  They had a fantastic Reggae Band playing on Sunday which made the Ho pool experience exponentially more romantic then usual...   Should have liked to enjoy some of the 24 hour room service that was available but we had so much fun out on the town that we did not get to take advantage of this feature!!!  Note that the Yelp check in offer of:  Free Desert w Dinner Entree,  will not be honored for room service orders because that would be an unquestionable waste of good will...  Lame sauce!"}
{"text":"The decor alone seals the deal for me. Mid Century modern, and the restaurant is done well. Favorite place to dine with one of my friends and catch up. Sitting in the booths makes it feel super private. The chopped salad is what I always get simply because I adore it. Green goddess dressing is incredible. They serve rolls and butter, and they are the real thing! A throwback for sure...super soft and warm! I might be addicted to iced tea (jury is still out) and I am delighted by how it is served here...big, tall glass, mint, a side of simple syrup for sweetening, and an iced tea spoon! It's the simple things sometimes that really add to my experience :) Not sure if they still serve this, but their cake & a shake for desert is to die for. Tiny chocolate shake served with tiny chocolate cake. Perfect little treat!"}
{"text":"We ate at Zu Zu for the first time during Arizona restaurant week for dinner. Had a nice booth along the back of the restaurant, which was great. The patio looked nice,but it was too windy that evening to partake and the pool was still open and a little too rowdy noise wise for us. I had the Rocky Point shrimp & scallop appetizer which was a little like a gazpacho,good though. My DH had the caesar salad.  For the entree I had the beef short ribs with green chile grits, loved it. Not spicy at all,but flavorful. My DH had the Asian BBQ salmon.  For dessert one of us had the warm chocolate flourless cake and the other choice was key lime pie. Both were very good. A bread basket with nice soft rolls and butter were delivered to the table shortly after being seated. The salmon & short ribs on the regular menu were $29/$28. just themselves, so I  highly recommend in the fall you check out AZ Restaurant week at Zu Zu if participating or another restaurant. The meal was $33. per person and also included a glass of red or white wine or a beer. My DH had a jalapeno margarita($13.00) and I had the 2 glasses of red that were included. We used the valet parking option which was complimentary,but a tip is expected. I did not see self parking,but there probably was some somewhere."}
{"text":"What a fun little joint this is! During my recent stay at Hotel Valley Ho, I was able to check out this bar on two separate occasions. One evening we enjoyed the happy hour cocktails while enjoying the lively ambience of the patio. Our sweet server even brought us out an extra cocktail when a spare one had been made at the bar.   On the second night, some colleagues and I shared a bottle of wine in the lobby after an evening out on the town. It was such a fun and low-key place on a Tuesday night at 9 or 10 pm. I'm there are many times when this place is absolutely riotous, but it was the perfect speed for me to catch up with colleagues from all over the continent. I think the bar is one of the very best parts of staying in this hotel! Have your last drink (or two) just steps from your room? Yes, please!"}
{"text":"We had a great lunch on the outdoor patio - the rolls are awesome, soft and home made!  The check need salad was good as was the entree, i would definitely go back to try one of their amazing shakes!"}
{"text":"First off food was good, ordered the rib hash and stuffed french toast both were excellent. Others ordered the red velvet pancake which was ok, egg dishes were great. They have organic preserves which were yummy. Scones which they serve to the table for free were on point and good. They have a version of orange julius which you should order.  That being said the burgers had to be sent back because they were all well done not medium rare as ordered. Even after replacement the burgers were blah. To there credit the burgers were all free.  Service is the reason for 3 stars. They refused to split the check for 9 people on a business lunch. This overally complicated the check out process, the waitress not knowing how to proceed just decided to split the check evenly between us all without our consent to do so. This checkout process took a total of 45 minutes. Most infuriating though was after telling the waitress we were now running late for work she took 20 minutes to run 6 credit cards.  Overall food was hit or miss. When hit it was orgasmic. When missed it was edible which cost them one star. Next star for: Service needs to improve and basically ruined our experience. Message to manager: consider upgrading to a technology that allows you to split the check like Denny's or iHOP or plug in your restaurant."}
{"text":"If you are attempting to go here with a large group DO NOT bother!!!! Even though we asked for separate checks (with the understanding the 20% gratuity would be added to all checks) from the beginning the waitress could just not understand the concept or figure it out. We spent over 35 minutes trying to close out. And she still couldn't split the check. We ended up having to give her all the cards and split evenly. Such a headache and just ruined the whole experience. In my opinion the 20% mandatory gratuity was not deserved! I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate dinner here the first night of our stay at Hotel Valley Ho. Our server, Mare, was very sweet and helpful and didn't interrupt our meal, but still made sure we had everything we needed. The fresh, hot rolls served beforehand were delicious and my bacon cheeseburger was great. The bacon was thick cut and crunchy, just the way I like it. My friend's truffled grilled cheese was decent, not exactly what I usually look for in a grilled cheese (not very melty or grilled, and not a whole lot of gooey cheese) but it was a fresh alternative to a burger. We had a salad (mediocre) a few nights later and the mixed drinks were the same, at best. It was nice sitting outside once the sun went down and listened to the Beatles and Sinatra as we listened to the poolside's last stragglers of the evening."}
{"text":"Very chic yet relaxed spot for brunch and pool time.  Free delicious scones was a major plus! The food service was a bit on the slow side, but it came out very tasty. I was not a fan of the $7 mimosas... Just way too expensive for my taste. However, I believe you get a very large glass of champagne for that. We took advantage of the free dessert for checking in and it was soooo good!"}
{"text":"It was a rainy weekend here in the Valley of the Sun, so we grabbed our umbrellas and walked over to the Valley Ho for breakfast.  And again, they out did themselves!   The ambiance, the decor, the vibe and the staff were AWESOME!!  I had the biscuits & gravy special, friend had a veggie omelet, coffee was perfect!!  Best breakfast place in Old Town !!"}
{"text":"Comfort food in a gourmet style.  The atmosphere is great and the food is delicious.    The restaurant is in the recently renovated Hotel Valley Ho and they did a great job at creating a retro style restaurant with food worth coming back for."}
{"text":"This place has gone down a wrung from the last time I was here about a year ago. The food is still traditional and well-prepared and fresh and tasty. I do believe there is a chef back there somewhere who cares. The front house leaves more to be desired. Staff are courteous but there's a lack of consistency in professionalism. The booth seats were dirty, covered in crumbs and you could see piles of crumbs stuffed between the cracks.  I swept them away with my hands rather than put up a fuss. Our waiter was friendly though when he cleared our plates he left one small dish and a fry on the table. In fact he left the billfold next to the fry. Why didn't he bother really clearing the table?   The young woman who brought our food looked perplexed at what to do when she still saw us with salads. She took my dining partner's plate away (didn't ask) then I shoved mine aside. She took my fork. Didn't replace it. I had to scoot out the crumb-ridden booth and take one off another table.  Bread for the table was re-gifted. Seemed reheated, crispy and old.  This is elementary restaurant work folks. And we're dining, bordering on fine dining. Make sure people have silverware and time the meal delivery. Also in a fine environment don't ask if people are through so much. Plates are taken away when everyone at the table is finished. Otherwise one is getting dessert while the other is still working on a steak and then people aren't eating together anymore. It's simple dining training.  I actually found the service far below the level of the food. I would choose to eat elsewhere in the plethora of nearby dining choices than repeat the experience here, though they do a great steak and with a brush up on consistency and front of house professionalism I'd want to come back and pair it with my stay at VH."}
{"text":"Today was my second visit to Zuzu. I came here for the this month's Showstopper shake. June's is Strawberry Short cake. Absolutely delicious. The appetizers here are also very tasty. This is a chill place during their happy hour and we've had great service each time. I can't wait for the next flavor."}
{"text":"I'm local and live in the old town area, so we eat out quite a bit. We decided to try Zuzu since it's Restaurant week and boy were we pleasantly surprised! The atmosphere is very modern and hip, as to be expected from the Valley Ho, and the food was Outstanding!! Very creative and full of flavor. Since it was restaurant week we all ordered different things and shared to try a variety of things. We tried all the appetizers, the bacon pork loin, wagyu skirt steak and salmon for entrees, and both desserts. For appetizers I would definitely recommend the Lobster grits. This was a delicious dish, full of flavor and textures it pleased in multiple ways. For the entree they were all really good but I enjoyed the wagyu beef the best. Beautifully presented, with two types of potatoes including a mash and some shoestrings that reminded me of the shoestring chips we used to enjoy when I was a kid. For the dessert, definitely recommend the Meyer Lemon meringue. All I can say is.... WOW!! The perfect mix of sweet and tart, with some salty graham crackers and fruit for garnish. It was so delightful and enjoyable I wish I had a spatula to eat up every spec of this!! If you gave me a large bowl of it I would eat the whole thing. My mother in law who doesn't typically like sweets ate her entire dessert as well.  Overall a very enjoyable meal and would highly recommend. If you're lucky enough to read this review soon get in here this week for restaurant week to save some coin and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly but the food is average.   Had a mushroom, cheese and spinach omelette but found no cheese. The potatoes were super flavorful, if not too flavorful, and had a nice crisp while not being too done or undone in the middle.   We had an average sized group (6) for brunch and the waiter made sure food allergies were accounted for. He made some good recommendations and informed us of the mimosa/ Bloody Mary bar when our bachelorette party started ordering.   Will go back, the bar has amazing cocktails, but I may research other brunch spots nearby."}
{"text":"I really love this place. We came for Christmas dinner with our family (2nd time doing that, by the way).  The service was impeccable, the food was scrumptious, and the atmosphere was very welcoming and serene.    The holiday menu was fabulous, but being pregnant there are only so many things I can/want to eat right now.  But for the holiday they had the regular menu available along with the holiday menu.  Our server was great, but very busy.  She had a lot of tables but she was easy to track down if we needed something.  I can't wait to come back for brunch."}
{"text":"i ate breakfast here the two days i stayed at the hotel. the decor lives up to the standard set throughout the whole property. everything down to the light fixtures is perfect. the food and service were terrible. to be specific, the water for my hot tea was room-temp the first day and cold the next. the eggs were cold and not tasted oily. the potatoes were underdone when we asked for well-done potatoes. they mischarged us on the second day as well. over-priced is to be expected at a hotel so that didn't shock me. what did shock me was that  could not find my waitress, ever. the breakfasts took an hour each and we were late to both of our morning appointments. the best thing I can say is that the bacon was out of this world."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast on a Monday morning as I was staying in Hotel Valley Ho. It's in the lobby and hard to beat the value of being able to walk from your room.   They bragged about being able to eat 'poolside' and I thought I'd try to enjoy that. Living in Seattle, anytime you get sunshine is a good thing.  The restaurant is completely empty and I asked the waitress if I could sit outside. She tells me yes and to have a seat wherever I'd like and she'd be out.   She brings me a menu and I order some OJ. She comes back out and asks what I'd like to order. The process seems to be going easy and fast enough and I think \"Huh. Not too bad.\"  One little sidenote: The menu upstairs for Cafe Zuzu in the hotel rooms had different prices than the menu in the restaurant.  I ordered the fruit plate and a cinnamon roll.   The waitress brings out my food & promptly forgets about me. One other couple joined me out on the patio and she only came out to take their order once and didn't return for quite a while.   It was so bad that I had to go inside after 20 mins to ask her if she could bring me my check. When I walked inside, the restaurant was still empty and she was re-filling the sugar containers.   I don't expect her to hover while people are enjoying their meal but I had finished my OJ and had obviously finished my meal and was just waiting for her to come back.   When she finally did bring my bill, she was just rude and abrupt.   Perhaps it is an Arizona thing but the servers and hotel staff did not seem pleased to be doing their jobs. And paying clients like myself are the ones who have to suffer."}
{"text":"Cozy cone, this place was very quiet and pleasant. We had a late breakfast here and totally loved it. Food was good, service was nice... coffee was soo good. I really enjoyed it.  Have fun"}
{"text":"Stopped into Zuzu for a late night dinner. Our server Matt from Michigan was awesome. He was friendly and attentive. Service was 5 stars and food was 4 stars. Will come again just for the excellent service!!"}
{"text":"I was staying at The Valley Ho & Zuzu is the hotel's restaurant, so it was very convenient. I sat at the bar & Lauren was the bartender.  She was delightful, very attentive & helped me pick out a delicious drink.  I think it was a cucumber cooler.  I also had the Turkey BLT, which was just as described.  Very good. Really hit the spot for me tonight.  I'd definitely eat at Zuzu again!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant a few years ago for breakfast and really liked it. Now we stayed at the Valley Ho again and thought we'd try dinner. Unacceptable. Filet with Hollandaise was swimming in Hollandaise. More like Hollandaise with filet maybe? Probably it is supposed to be creative cuisine? But cuisine doesn't have to be re-invented. It's good or bad. This was BAD. Ingredients seemed okay but the cooking......the KUNG PAO GAME HEN  (crispy game hen, forbidden fried rice, spicy baby bok choy, roasted peanuts + kung pao sauce) was crispy all right....it was deep fried! I would like to know that when I read the menu.... We always loved the Valley Ho but now somehow lost interest in even going back to the hotel.  That should never happen in a hotel like this..."}
{"text":"Came here this past weekend with my sisters bachelorette and the customer service was amazing. All of the staff was super accommodating and went out of their way to make sure we were having a great time. Not only was the staff amazing, but the food as well."}
{"text":"Husband and I went for tour at Valley Ho hotel and part of the tour gave us a 20% off meal. First we had a drink at the bar and was a very good and generous drink. The bar had fun vibe for hanging out. Then moved to a circular booth in the restaurant. I ordered the spaghetti squash. It was the best meal I have had during this visit to Az. It was very flavorful and satisfying. It had a spicy tomato sauce and had colorful small half tomatoes in the sauce that were cooked just right. The spaghetti squash lay upon spinach that also was cooked just right. The husband had the veggie burger which he liked and from the couple bites i had, was good. From what i could tell it was prepared there and not from a boxed veggie patty you can get at a grocery store, if ya know what i mean. I can't say enough how cool this hotel is. It's retro Mid Century Modern. If you are interested in architecture and design, the authenticity is incredible.  Good service throughout our experience."}
{"text":"Loved this place...the whole atmosphere.   Went there to watch a entertainer in the lounge and was unexpected surprise!   It's a boutique hotel!  The decor and interior are very cool!  Reminded me of a hotel in Hollywood,  California! Just had drinks, but I heard the food was good also.   Drinks were great.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation during Restaurant Week to come back to ZuZu after so many years to see if this restaurant was as good as we remembered it.  First off, it was not only restaurant week, but also they offered 50% off bottles of wine, so we enjoyed a lovely bottle of Mt. Veeder Cabernet for $40...what a steal!  I enjoyed the butternut squash ravioli to start, the pork chop with asparagus and polenta for my entree and the peanut butter cheesecake as my dessert.  What a treat and such a steal at $33/person!  This restaurant might become part of our regular restaurant week rotation!"}
{"text":"Had dinner on Saturday night.  Cool retro decor.    We split a wedge salad and the grilled cheese.  Both were very good. My gf ordered the Beef stroganoff and I ordered the pork chop.  She liked her entree and I liked the pork chop until I cut into it and found that it was way undercooked.  The server and manager were apologetic and took care of me.  I changed my order to the fresh fish of the day which turned out to be good.   The mojitos were also very good.   We'll come back and try the place for breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Caters to party animals with managers picking their battles loosely."}
{"text":"Bar drinks, and atmosphere make this a three star instead of a two star.   Good for happy hour. Bad for dinner.  Service was adequate at best. Drinks arrived correct and timely, (we were one of four total tables on a Saturday at 7:30 pm), food did not take long, and bill arrived in a timely fashion.  We ask to see a Sunday brunch menu which never arrived, and the server had a slightly arrogant attitude which did not help. He gave suggestions when ask but very short with no description. Example, \" What app is better mussels or tortellini?\" Answer. \"Mussels\". No reason, no flavor, no added input, just mussels.  Food. The recommended mussels were the worst thing of the night. I had a terrible after taste on the two I ate, and thought maybe it was a bad combo with the drink I was having. Then my wife stated the same thing, and we compared the after taste we were having to a scent. I will spare you the scent but it was not something you would ever expect to feel like you tasted, nor want to. We did not complain however the manager noted we ate very few of them, and ask why. To my wives embarrassment I explained the flavor in with the scent we tasted, and had a laugh with him about it. I was not trying to be rude, just being honest about the flavors. (I was a server all through collage) He stated he would remove them from the bill, and took them away. I mentioned to him that we weren't upset, and understand this happens. (remember we did not complain, he ask). The mussels were still on the bill when we paid. My wife and I both had the dinner specials, which were pretty good. I had scallops, which all but one side of them were seared properly The sauce was great, and all in all good a dinner.    I had the Bramble from the bar, which was the highlight of the night for me. It is $10 regularly, however $4 on happy hour. Great drink Wine list was good enough, and very reasonable."}
{"text":"I only came here for happy hour.  I love the ambiance of this place.  Very retro 60's feel.  The drinks were a bit tart and nothing special.  I wish I was hungry because some of the food sounded really good."}
{"text":"Cafe ZuZu has a Rock'in BREAKFAST !!!! First, the BEST bloodymary I have ever had!! niiiiiice and spicy. The eggwhite omelet and the cheesy grits are to die for !! I wanna go back soon!!! Or maybe It was just too much vino from the night before..........Either way.............it hit the spot perfectly :)"}
{"text":"One of the best \"cafés\" I've ever been to the entire staff was as friendly and fun as you could have ever hoped for! They honestly were one of the best parts of my and my groups entire night!!! I would absolutely recommend this lounge for cocktails before a night on the town!"}
{"text":"We stayed at Valley Ho and ate at Cafe ZuZu several days for breakfast.  I had their delicious thick Belgian waffle w/ sundried cherry butter.  Delicious!  That butter is something else.  Even their syrup was good.  Not too sweet.  Just right, IMO.  The ambiance is retro-60's.  Love it!  The staff was polite and fast with the food and coffee refills.  Convenient and good breakfast food."}
{"text":"Coffee and dessert only review.  I love the lounge's mid-century\" form before function\" furnishings.  It isn't very comfortable, but not too bad if you're not going to stay for longer than a couple of hours.    Limited in dessert choices.  I had the peanut butter mousse.  It's like taking a spoonful of Jiff creamy peanut butter and coating it with chocolate ganache and charge $6 for it.  Hubby got the sundae topped with whipped cream and sprinkles...nothing to rave about.  I don't know what type of coffee they served, but they could use a better brand.  The three star was really for the acoustic guitarist duo who played all genres, unplugged.  They made the night fun.  I will definitely come back here again and try the HH nosh and drinks people rave about!"}
{"text":"I hate to Give ZuZu 4 stars because their breakfast menu deserves 5 stars; however their lunch menu is very limited and could improve, for example there is only two salad on the lunch menu and out of that the kale salad is really bitter. The kids lunch menu is prefect and well made! The staff is also very nice and accommodating"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and had a mixed crowd. The lobster and asparagus grits were good but I did not taste any lobster. I got the steak option with the mashed potatoes and spinach. The steak was very tender and had a good taste. The chocolate tart was very good and rich. The only item I wasn't happy with was the bread. It seemed store bought and wasn't warm. I would not have gone to Zu Zus if it weren't part of restaurant week. Overall it was very nice."}
{"text":"This place is a total rip-off. Yes the food is really good however I called in advance to see if I can bring in a cake to celebrate my friend's birthday as we have a dinner reservation. They will not allow me to do this unless I pay their cake cutting fee which is $2.50 per person! This is very unfortunate as most places aren't this expensive with their cutting fee and will at least let you bring in a cake from outside as long as you cut it yourself. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the hotel and had to try this place out. The California eggs Benedict was so delicious and I will definitely be back to the hotel and this restaurant"}
{"text":"My family and I headed to Cafe Zuzu for breakfast after reading good reviews on Yelp. We were not disappointed. The decor of the hotel and restaurant is fun - very retro - so the experience was good from the get-go. The food was fabulous. Can you believe a bottomless basket of delicious scones?? My daughter ordered the California Benedict and loved it. I ignored calories and got the stuffed French toast, stuffed with lemon cream cheese and berries. Yum! No butter or syrup needed.   On top of all of this good food, we decided to try a Frosty Ho-Jay. Wow! I will be ordering this again, but not when eating French toast.  Too many sweets. I wouldn't mind stopping by just to have a Frosty Ho-Jay on its own. It's like a creamcicle milkshake.  We will definitely be back and we will insist that any guests we have come along too."}
{"text":"Such a nice Intimate retro kind of hotel. Food is fresh and delicious...rooms are clean and comfy. We will come again soon"}
{"text":"The food was ok. Not much of a big menu selection either. Ended up here cause the place I originally wanted to go to was closed on New Years Day.  Even though a certain site that starts with a Y and ends with a P that will remain nameless told me that it was open.  I will agree with other Yelpers about the ambiance being really cool. I'll go check it out again if I happen to be in the area and others places are packed. But I honestly don't see any reason to go there again."}
{"text":"Gonna have to rain on the breakfast parade a little bit, I'm afraid.  I'm on an unofficial mission to try all the great or very good or excellent breakfast joints in the Phoenix area.  On my Yelp search for a Sunday breakfast, I hit on Cafe ZuZu and decided to give it a try.  I wish I hadn't done that.  $27 later, I couldn't wait to get home to eat after the meal.  In order and succinctly:  Spicy Bloody Mary - decent tasting, albeit not very SPICY at all.  Came with a full stalk of celery, a wedge of lime AND lemon, and two olives. Problem:  it was MOSTLY ICE.  I got about 6-7 good pulls on the straw and it was empty.  And there sat a full glass of ice, stuffed in the glass top to bottom.  Look - I know MOST places do this, and at times I have even asked for NO ICE in my Bloody Mary.  I guess I'm going to have to make that a solid habit.  I don't like getting so obviously ripped off.  I work hard for my money, and I don't appreciate having to pay $6.50 for 75 cents worth of Bloody Mary contents.  Side of Thick Cut Virginia Bacon - very nice taste, cooked about right.  This was the highlight of the meal.  Breakfast Casserole - my SORE point, even more-so than the Bloody Mary.  It was advertised in the menu as this: \"sweet Italian sausage, roasted potatoes, bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes + cheddar, topped with a poached egg (or substitute sour cream for egg)\"  All that WAS true.  But here's the MAJOR PROBLEM:  the amount of \"sweet Italian sausage\" was about the size of two quarters.  I'm not kidding.  There were 4 thinly sliced slivers of sausage, about the thickness and size of half a quarter dollar each.  That was it for the sausage.  The dish was SMALL too, about the size of my hand and not much thicker.  It was mostly green, red, and yellow bell pepper.  Mushrooms were good, what there were of them. The roasted potatoes portion consisted of about 3 medium-sized potato wedges.  Here's how they made it:  Cut all the veggies,add the two tiny slices of sausage, and cover it with cheddar.  Nuke, then add a poached egg on top.  It was something I could make at my house, but never would, because there was no seasonings involved.  Just the ingredients, smothered with melted cheddar.  Not creative, and not very tasty at ALL.  Felt ripped off at $11.75.  Ambiance and setting was good. The facility is nice.  The service was good.  The food and the lack of value are what ruined this meal.  But if you can't bring me some tasty. memorable (in a GOOD way) food, then I'm not going to be coming back."}
{"text":"The Red Velvet Waffle is a must! Hands down it is my favorite brunch item. The berry & chocolate chip biscuits they serve are also delish!  If you're a bacon fan, I recommend ordering a side.   Our waitress was attentive and pleasant. Will be back if only for the waffle and biscuits."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for work and really enjoyed the Ahi Tuna Salad.  It was so fresh and delicious! My coworker ordered the Rubin sandwich and said it was very good! Def going back for dinner!"}
{"text":"A pricey endevor to come here for breakfast and drinks.  Good, but pricey.  The stuffed french toast was very good, as well as the eggs benedict.  I like that they serve gritts, even though I don't personally like to eat them.   Bloody Mary's and mimosas were tasty.  I've been back, it's kind of a fun place to take visiting guests."}
{"text":"Been here for brunch twice in the last while and it has been awesome. Service is good and each item I've had and the others with me were great. Very laid back. Great for Sunday brunch"}
{"text":"It's a shame. Disappointed.  I wish they would stop changing the Happy Hour menu. In my opinion, they used to have the best HH menu in all of AZ.  They have now changed it yet again, doubled in prices, and the selections were unworthy.    Not sure why they always try to fix what is not broken.  Please bring back the Chicken Drumettes with the honey bourbon sauce, the Artisan Grilled Cheese with the brie and fig jam, and The Prime Rib Dip which was to die for."}
{"text":"If you don't want to go to bed drunk on an empty stomach while staying at the Valley Ho, I highly recommend the fries with the sriracha aoli! If you're still not drunk enough, order a dirty martini while you wait for your fries."}
{"text":"Wow..I can't believe the level of disappointment... First, we eat out quite frequently, yet, don't bring snobbery to the evaluation. So, yes, our waitress was very nice and accommodating, yet, the food, the drinks...set a new low in our book. My daughter ordered the grilled salmon and it arrived, swamped in some kind of relish mixture.  Even though famished, she had to back off after a few bites. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and was greeted by 3 pieces of dehydrated iceberg lettuce, along with some kind of crusty chicken mixture..I quickly returned  it, a behavior I rarely exercise. The Long Island I consumed clearly was created from cheap alcohol blends and other than the delicious French fries, this meal set a new standard for \"low\". Ambiance is the only salvation and garnered the 2nd star. Stay away..you have been warned. Only eat this food if you are deeply intoxicated and have lost the capacity to be discriminate."}
{"text":"I stopped by ZuZu this past weekend to get a showstopper shake for dessert. It was super delicious and possibly the cutest thing ever! Can't wait to come back for dinner.  It was nice that you can sit in the bar area but still have access to the entire ZuZu menu!"}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary with friends. I posted pictures. I apologize that they're half-eaten and upside down, but hey, at least I got a few before we finished the meal. I can't count how many times I've done that.  Had the chicken picatta, which was excellent. Others had the chicken and penne, stroganoff, and ribeye. Prices are a little steep (about 20 bucks on average), but they are typical for a resort restaurant. Excellent service--she even cracked a joke (on me!).  The lounge area is great and the bartenders enjoyable. We went to the lounge bar before dinner and for a night cap every night we stayed at the Ho.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was excellent! They have a great brunch menu and I love the decor!"}
{"text":"Meet George Jetson!  This classic cartoon song kept replaying in my head as we spent time at ZuZu!  I love the retro look of this place!  When I visit family in Scottsdale I often find myself spending time at this hotel sitting at the pool and ordering drinks and lunch!  The pool is open to the public as long as you are buying food or drinks, and the retro feel just adds to the fun! ZuZu is no different!  From the time you walk in to the time you are leaving, it is just plain fun for me!  We dined at ZuZu on a Saturday night, so we were sure to make reservations.  I had not eaten at the restaurant previously, again only at the pool which is a completely different menu.  We had reservations at 6:30, but decided to go early to have happy hour cocktails in the lounge.  The staff and bartenders are welcoming and friendly.  The lounge was very crowded but we did manage to find a table to enjoy our drinks. Headed to the restaurant at 6:30 and our table was waiting for us.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable and offered advice when asked.  Most of us ordered the short ribs. The short ribs were ancho chile braised with creamy green chile grits.  They arrived steaming hot and fork tender!  They had so much flavor that each bite was a delight!!  The grits were amazing as well. I had also discovered that by checking in on Yelp you received a free dessert.  I had absolutely no room for dessert, but our waitress was more than happy to box it up for me!  I ordered the Key Lime Pie and really enjoyed it later.  Perfectly tangy but not over tart. All in all I loved this dining experience.  It may be slightly higher priced than other restaurants, but that is to be expected in a hotel resort restaurant, and in my opinion was worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This is a rare instance when I don't always think my meal is 5-star worthy, but I cannot drop a star.  I love ZuZu that much!  I don't go that often, but I'm always reminded why I should.  Actually, I'm reminded whenever I watch It's A Wonderful Life  I am finally learning that for dinner I should stick with the beef stroganoff.  As much as I have enjoyed other meals, I always miss having that sin on a plate.  And where else are you going to find that dish anymore?  My only criticism is sometimes they don't drain the noodles enough, and there's too much water in the bowl.  But even that can't ruin the rich mushroom sauce with the pint of sour cream on top just waiting for me to marry the two.  Enough for two meals!  My 2013 resolution?  Go to ZuZu outside the month of December."}
{"text":"My wife and I spent a weekend at the Valley Ho recently so we decided to try the restaurant especially because of all the good reviews here on Yelp.  We didn't have reservations but we were directed to a table in the lounge bar which features the same menu which by the way is quite varied from simple sandwiches to gourmet entrees.  Our table was directly across from the lengthy mid century bar so it was perfect for people watching.  The crowd was noticeably upscale, well dressed and surprisingly young for what amounts to an \"old fashioned\" hotel.  Perhaps young people admire the fun and hope filled 60's when dressing nicely was expected and cocktails were king.  I had a pastrami sandwich and a beer which was real good.  My wife loved their kale salad even though I don't get the attraction or popularity of that green leafy stuff.  It appeared to be a nicely prepared salad with loads of salady accoutrements and a tasty dressing.  This is a fun place to go to."}
{"text":"How many times have you been seated at a table in an interesting, well reviewed or recommended restaurant, been handed a menu and went about selecting your meal?  Have you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes? Wanted to know what goes into getting food on your plate?  As an avid foodie this is something that is always on my mind so when Chef Sean Currid of Cafe ZuZu at Scottsdale, Arizona's Hotel Valley Ho invited me into his kitchen to observe Service firsthand, I jumped at the opportunity!  Cafe ZuZu, set in the historic Hotel Valley Ho on the Western edge of Old Town Scottsdale, is a hidden gem. Not only are the grounds nostalgic but the food is fantastic and the atmosphere relaxing.  I entered the kitchen towards the end of \"Happy Hour,\" and got the grand tour from Chef Currid. One thing I noticed immediately was how small the dry storage and walk-in refrigerators were, indicating freshness of ingredients through rapid use.  In the kitchen, Chef Currid can be found on the line, sleeves rolled up, preparing dishes and directing his kitchen crew, care and experience ensuring every dish goes out true to concept.  What I was most interested in was the food and Cafe ZuZu does not disappoint! Beginning with happy hour small plates priced at $3 each ($5-$6 is what I would have expected to pay for these delights), I ate my way thru Chef Currid's cuisine.  Chicken drumettes fried to a crisp, golden brown, lightly seasoned and served with bourbon honey dipping sauce got things started. These plump little chicken tasties were a pleasant break from the ubiquitous wing and paired with what can only be compared to liquid gold (honey bourbon sauce), are a must have!  Walking through the kitchen earlier I had noticed a HUGE herb crusted prime rib roast preparing to spend a few hours in a hot oven, this meat found it's way onto the next plate as a Prime Rib dip sandwich.  Shaved nearly paper thin, topped with melted cheese and placed atop a crusty baguette, complimented by a rich, flavorful jus and horseradish mayo, this sandwich delivered far in excess of $3 worth of flavor!  There's something about grilled cheese that's comforting but Cafe ZuZu takes it to a whole different level with their Artisan grilled cheese duo.  Crunchy, buttery sliced baguette topped with melted Brie cheese, crisp green apple and fig jam, these little jewels are absolutely packed with flavor, texture and are about the best thing to pass my lips in recent memory! (simple, elegant, perfect and at $3, the best deal in the Valley!)  No happy hour menu is complete without good bruschetta and Cafe ZuZu does not disappoint. Bright red, juicy tomatoes, fresh basil and Parmesan cheese are combined to make this classic, simple dish.  As happy hour ended, the first of the dinner appetizers went past my fork. Butternut squash ravioli ($10), followed by Prince Edward Island Mussels ($10)  The giant al dente ravioli stuffed with creamy butternut squash, topped with sauteéd diced squash, looked and tasted lovely! A quenelle of pumpkin cream melted into the dish providing the perfect accompaniment and a touch of micro greens for color an texture rounded this dish out nicely.  There aren't too many things better in my opinion, than a plate of mussels in a rich, savory broth. Paired with spicy Spanish chorizo, ZuZu's Prince Edward Island mussels, tomato and fennel are just devine! Did I mention the white wine and garlic broth?  As my time in Chef Currid's kitchen drew to a close (and the button on my jeans began to strain dangerously), the evenings featured dish found it's way in front of me and a fresh fork materialized in my hand.  Tender Sautéed beef tips, garlic roasted potatoes, roasted root vegetables including beets, parsnip and even a little Brussels sprout sneaked in (I'd never have believed this would be one of my favorite vegetables), all on a rich port wine reduction, perfectly executed and absolutely delicious. Find a rainy day, order this dish if it's available and prepare to be satisfied.  A roasted tomato and goat cheese casserole ($9.50) went by too fast for me to divert and get my fork into but from the looks of it and after having sampled the previous dishes, I'd bet it is worth a return visit.  All in all, my time as an observer in Chef Currid's kitchen at Cafe ZuZu was well spent. The cuisine is far beyond what you might expect of a typical \"hotel restaurant,\" and absolutely worth investigating.  Whether you're looking for a generously priced happy hour delivering food far beyond expectation or a gourmet meal without pomp and circumstance, Cafe ZuZu delivers!"}
{"text":"A great veggie omelet with squash, sun dried tomatoes. asparagus so fresh it must have been grown locally. Endless coffee cup and superb service. I rate this restaurant a ten and I will be back."}

{"text":"The happy hour is really really bad quality anf very small portions. Was not what I expected. The patio area is nice though."}
{"text":"Celebrated NYE here last night.. we all had a very good time.. cool decor, loads of eye candy and well priced comfort food, cant go wrong.. well mostly.  For whatever reason the waitress ordered all of our food at one so guess what? All the food came out at once.. I was pretty ticked off about this as the same thing happened at Cheesecake Factory (haven't been back, yuck!).. a place of this caliber sending out salads on top of entre's left me scratching my head. So my fillet sat there and got cold while I finished my salad.. sent it back. The chef came out (WOOF!) and talked to me about the timing which I thought was very cool.. he ended up making me a special plate of the most yummy braised lamb served with creamy grits.. both were awesome and I hate grits.. I was cleaning the plate with a fresh made dinner roll.. was great!!  The pastry chef made the entire table a sampling of desserts.. he makes lemon meringue pie just like mom.. plus being cute as a button.. well you know me, I'm a sucker for a chef!   If it weren't for the chef I would have banged this place badly due to the timing issue but his charisma and charm won me over.. well, actually it was the lamb!!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast in Arizona. The atmosphere the service and the food are exemplary of times past brought to the future. Everything on the menu is thoughtfully planned and carefully executed and expertly served. You feel special when you have breakfast here! Bacon and poached eggs with creamy grits and chilled tomato juice while dining with friends makes a memorable meal! The smoked salmon platter and red velvet waffles are sublime."}
{"text":"We had a nice weekend here for a business retreat and the hotel definitely has a nice flavor to it.  Ahhhh, dreaming of sleeping in and ordering some room service again.  Sigh. Okay, so upon arrival we had lunch at ZuZu and both ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad.  I've been eating pretty clean in preparation for the weekend pool party and endless mojitos, but this salad didn't make me sad!  It was delicious.  Another great item was the shrimp spring rolls.  Very light and tasty.  I would definitely recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"We stopped in for Restaurant Week and sooo glad we did! We had reservations for 7pm but got there early and was promptly seated in a great little corner booth. My boyfriend and I each had a cocktail and looked over the restaurant week menu (you can also order off the full menu as well). Everything looked great on the restaurant week menu so we each decided on ordering off of that. My boyfriend started with the Coffee Rubbed Bison Carpaccio and I had the Lobster + Asparagus Anson Mills Grits and both were OUTSTANDING! I am craving mine still. We then both settled on the Wagyu Flat Iron Steak. Normally we bot get something different but we were both craving that. It was soooo good. The portions were HUGE too! I couldn't finish all of mine. Then for dessert we both settled on the Lemon Meringue Posset and it was so refreshing!   Our server was excellent as well.   It had been years (since they reopened in the early 2000's) and that was the last time I had eaten at ZuZu and it was not impressive at all hence why I had not been back in years but after this dinning experience we will certainly be back soon whether for cocktails and apps or dinner."}
{"text":"Super tasty brunch (not a buffet). I highly recommend banana pancakes (banana pudding between the layers), tasty big bacon, homemade cinnamon rolls are buttery sweet goodness, and the bloody mary's are spicy and yummy. One tip- on Sunday's they have a build your own bloody mary bar for $5. On Saturday its $6.50.  Nancy is an amazingly attentive waitress and their manager Tina is willing to assist in any way possible. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love coming here because I feel like I'm in the show Mad Men. That's the style of the entire hotel though. I like sitting at the bar and I still get great service. All the food I've had their is very good."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We sat outside by their fire pit & had dinner & drinks. The bartender Sean was very nice and recommended tasty drinks. Their HH is great. I had the tomato & goat cheese casserole and ate every last drop! It was very tasty! The ZuZu burger was very tasty as well. Comp valet was nice! The Valley Ho hotel is very trendy and cute! Will definitely visit again!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE ZUZU & the Hotel Valley Ho!  It seriously feels like a step back in time - to the 70s (or what I would imagine the 70's would be like) every time I come here. I brought my best friend from out of town here for brunch and we had a great experience. First off- we were sat at a comfy booth inside and given water. The server took our drink order (mimosas) and came back with OUT OF THIS WORLD chocolate chip scones! They were delicious and we ate every crumb. My friend ordered the eggs benedict and I got the red velvet waffle. I tried her eggs benedict and it was awesome. My waffle was good- just a bit of a sugar overload since we had had the scones. I can't wait to go back to ZUZU!!!"}
{"text":"extremely cool spot. polynesian, trendy, contemporary, retro....and full of well-dressed \"mature couples\", extremely hair gel-ed scottsdale dudes, and giant breasted, ultra mini-skirted scottsdale girls. i fit right in with my Old Navy/Target wear....  i havent' had PBR in a while, so i decided to go with that. too bad...something was wrong with their keg device so that was unavailable. so i opted for a limeade which was alcoholicly tasty. the app/happy menu is limited for vegetarian...only 2 choices, but the little grilled cheeses were awesomely tasty.   our waitress, poor girl, couldn't get anything right when we went. we asked if the chili had meat in it and she said no, so we ordered it and it was FULL of meat. luckily our dining partner ate meat so she chowed on that.   overall, cool ambiance and great for googling over people who are better looking, have more money, and more well dressed than me, but if you don't eat meat, have something to eat before you go and enjoy the drinks...."}
{"text":"Service is average but great environment . Dinner menu is delicious and drink menu is good. Part of hotel valley Ho so highly recommended if staying at hotel"}
{"text":"We decided to try out ZuZu for a weekend Brunch and finished with mixed reviews. We were seated immediately, but it took quite some time for a server to come and take our drink order. Someone else brought our drinks out and we then sat again for an extended period waiting to place our order. Finally a different server came and stated that they were taking over our table, odd but we were happy to finally order food.   The menu had so many options that I wanted to try. I decided on the breakfast burrito which was topped with green chili pork and a side of roasted potatoes. The flavors were amazing and everything went perfect together. I was surprised at how large the portions of all our meals were. It is nice because you are definitely getting your money's worth, but might be to much food for some people."}
{"text":"The waitress was super nice and very helpful and the food came out amazing. Thank you"}
{"text":"Amazing food here.  Don't know if the lounge is officially part of the restaurant but it's the same kitchen!  The Gniocchi is the best I've ever had!  Melts in your mouth good.  It was served with kale, bacon and mushroom cream sauce.  Amazing.  Looking forward to having that again when I return in January!"}
{"text":"This is a review for the Chef's Table Wine Tasting dinner with Clos du Val.  Bang for the Buck: 4/5 - the tasting dinner was nice and with the wine reasonably priced. I will go back.  Decor: 3/5 - a bit retro 70s, not my thing but done simply and it was fine  Ambiance: 3/5 - the room is open so not much privacy but the booth we were in gave a bit more than most spots  Service: 5/5 - they were great in all ways... very attentive, the wine flowed well; I had a bit too much :)  Food Quality: 5/5 - all was excellent her; top notch  Food Quantity: 4/5 - could have used a bit more on the plates... if I had not drank so much wine I would have still been hungry  Food Flavor: 5/5 - it is rare I give 5 here but this place deserves it on this meal. Everything was perfect!  Food Uniqueness & Creativity: 4.5/5 - very creative, perfectly paired flavors and in the right proportions.   Last Experience...  02/07/2011  Herb-Dusted Seared Ahi (braised tuscan kale, meyer lemon oil + pancetta) - amazing! honestly the best Ahi I've ever had. The herbs did not overpower but complimented  Warm Orange Braised Fennel (baby spinach, shaved red onion + parmesan croutons) - very good, could have used more fennel as that was a bit lacking in qty.  Flat Iron Steak and Duck Sausage (sweet pea tortellini + shiitake mushrooms) - perfect flavors, perfectly cooked. Would have liked to see one more slice of steak and more sausage... normally I'd have still been hungry  Chocolate Truffle Cake - this was the only item that was not great, it was so-so. flavors were average, and the cake part was a bit dry."}
{"text":"Love ZuZu for breakfast. Love the people, the food, the atmosphere.  I feel like I'm on vacation whenever I visit this place."}
{"text":"This past Thrusday, i had the privilege of meeting Chef Russell, as he catered an event in honor or my deceased husband, by way of Honor Brewery. The food they put out for us was tantalizing, with options for all tastes, whether picky or open-minded. Chef Russell spoke to me and offered his sincere honor and respect for my husband and for being allowed to participate in the event. If you ever want great food and terrific service go see Chef Russell at Cafe ZuZu."}
{"text":"Planks & Eggs: Good   I personally didn't love it, but, it was good. For me, I think it was too much going on and it didn't taste great altogether.   The Panna Cota dessert was ok, wasn't my favorite either.  The drinks were fab -- bellini's and bloody Mary's and breads/Jams were flavorful!"}
{"text":"Food gets 4 stars but I'd give service a 5! This is a cool restaurant, feels like you're going back in time a little bit with the ambiance of the hotel. There is a nice indoor and outdoor seating area. Service was quick and our server kept checking on us which was nice! We went for brunch and there were some great options! A little bit of everything, some unique options too. I ended up getting the crispy Belgian waffle. My mom and sister got omelets and my BF got a red velvet waffle. We also shared a cinnamon roll and I tried out the mimosa bar! Best thing I had was my waffle. Only thing that was weird about it was there was dried cherries on it, I thought that was an odd topping also it didn't say that on the menu. My bfs waffle was a little too dense but otherwise yummy. My mom and sister liked their omelets! The cinnamon roll was a letdown..looked amazing but just was super bread-y, like not at all gooey like a cinnamon roll should be. My mimosa was delicious too, the mimosa and Bloody Mary bar was cute. Overall a good experience!!"}
{"text":"So we were going to a show at Stand Up Scottsdale - and pulled our our trusty yelp app trying to find something within walking distance.  ZuZu was close enough that it was worth trying.  It took us a while to figure out how to get in (located near the lobby of the Valley Ho hotel) - but once we did, I had to shake my head as I thought I was stuck inside the movie Casino.  The decor / ambiance looked almost exactly like DeNiro & Sharon Stone's house in Vegas.  This instantly calmed me - much like warm milk.  Even though we only had about a half hour, the waitress made a couple spot-on recommendations (Beef Stroganoff & Pork Chop) - and after checking in on yelp we even got a free glass of house wine!  I'm not often in Scottsdale, but will be back due to the delicious food and retro ambiance.  Well played ZuZu, well played."}
{"text":"I love this place. The moment you walk in you feel like you're on vacation... In mad men. Which to me is perfect. But along with the relaxation comes the amazing food. I've been here for brunch and had the infamous red velvet waffles and I've also had dinner here a few times. All the visits have been spectacular in both the service and the taste of food. In fact, I chose this place as my birthday dinner and bring every out of towner here if that says anything on how much I like it! The only thing I wish I could skip would be the valet. As a side note, I've also been to the spa here and had a great experience getting a facial."}
{"text":"Went there last night to celebrate my birthday with some of my gal pals.   We ordered off the happy hour menu and sat in the lobby.    Had a great time -- as always!   They had the orange breeze; I think they liked it cause they had two or three each.   We ordered the fries, the guac and chips, the soft pretzel and the calamari.   All of it was good.   I think my favorite was the fries.   I liked how they were seasoned.   Everything was good.   Since we were celebrating my b day, we asked Charlie the server which was the biggest so we could all share.   It was great!!   YUMMM!!   Practically licking the glass.  Unfortunately, I don't remember the name and it's not on the website's menu.  I have been here for HHs in the past and I will definitely return.  Sit in the lobby or outdoors -- if weather permits.   It's great for people watching."}
{"text":"ZuZu's has a decent enough menu - we liked the kale salad and another time, I liked the spaghetti squash. My boyfriend liked their wines.  We ended up eating here 3 times during our stay at the Valley Ho hotel.  The food wasn't high end, but the prices weren't either.  The best part about about the whole experience - one day we had a waitress named Kate. SHE was terrific!  Really charming, efficient, fun.  I'm writing this review for her."}
{"text":"We loved the ambiance of ZuZu. The breakfast was delicious and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I wrapped up my stay at The Valley Ho by grabbing brekkie at Cafe ZuZu before heading out. Everything was delicious from the coffee to the farm fresh eggs, yummy bacon which could NOT have been more perfectly cooked and delicious sourdough. A lot of their ingredients are locally sourced so my brekkie was really a delicious conglomeration of all the goodness Arizona has to offer. What made this brekkie out of this world however was the Frosty Ho-Jay which is fresh squeezed Orange Juice blended with Vanilla gellato. I swear, my eyes almost rolled back in my head it was THAT good. Orange Julius can kiss my ass after this cosmic experience. Fantastic. I highly recommend Cafe Zuzu...if nothing else DO NOT leave until you've had the Frosty Ho-Jay. I can't believe I enjoyed a drink that much that had no alcohol in it."}
{"text":"Check in for your free dessert!  A group of us decided to walk from Tortilla Factory to Zuzu to get some drinks. When we walked in, we were pleasantly surprised that the place looks like it came out of the 70's with the decor and the lights.  Service was friendly and the atmosphere was good. Our group ordered drinks and we hung out for the rest of the night. I ate the key lime pie and it was really good. Maybe a little too rich, but it's not a bad thing.  It's off the main area of Old Town Scottsdale so it's tucked away and more quiet. :)"}
{"text":"Located in the Super Duper Valley Ho Hotel is Cafe ZUZU, just like stepping back in time, the decor is spot on with groovy tile tile, slick furniture, cool ass round booths, and bitchin' lighting.  The rock walls jutting in from the outside and the windows are reminiscent of the my home growing up.  The food was Delicious and the service was exceptional.  I had the ZuZu burger with fresh hand cut fries, I love a good burger and this did not disappoint.  The Chef thought my fry order was a little little light so he sent out more.  I just wish there were more places like this, paying attention to the details and service taking it from great to Fabulous."}
{"text":"Cafe ZuZu has a great happy hour.  However, you haven't experienced the best part of this restaurant until you've been to one of their Monday night chef's wine dinners.  This last Monday we were at a dinner featuring Cline Cellars' wines.  The dinner started out with a lobster risotto paired with a pinot gris.  Lots of lobster over creamy risotto was the perfect start.  Next was a warm mushroom and leek salad.  The Cline Cashmere blend wine might have been our favorite of the wines.  The herb roasted lamb chop with goat cheese and pine nut ravioli was outstanding.  For dessert we were served a peach bread pudding paired with a late harvest mouvedre.  What an outstanding finish to a fabulous meal.  Get on their email list for upcoming dinners.  Chef Wiley is one of the most talented chefs in the Valley and these dinners really let him show his talent and creativity.  At $52.50 per person they are a steal!"}
{"text":"I am beyond excited to be writing about ZuZu for my inaugural Yelp review!  Ok, maybe I'm late to the party on this one, but what a great little surprise to find in Scottsdale! It's at the Valley Ho which makes you feel somewhat cliche, retro and chic to even be there.    The bar area is a great place to hang out, grab a drink after work and watch all of the characters of Scottsdale parading through.  I went on a Monday night and it was very quiet, but I can imagine how it picks up on the weekends with the pool scene.    Here's the rundown...  Happy Hour... great deals on food and drinks and it goes until 7pm!  It's rare these days to find a HH that goes until 7pm, so I'm already a fan.  Service... our waiter was great and the perfect mix of helpful, funny, but not overbearing.  I always appreciate a waiter who gives honest opinions of menu items and doesn't just say he loves it all.  He was very personable and happy to let us just hang out and take our time.   Food... Truffle Fries - great but won't change your life...it's a great snack to share with the table but don't jeopardize another decision for the truffle fries.    Grilled Cheese - delish!  It comes with truffle, arugula and roasted tomatoes so it isn't your classic grilled cheese.  The arugula flavor was a little overwhelming but I'm also not the biggest arugula fan.  The grilled cheese is cut into 3 cute little pieces so it's perfect for sharing with the table if you don't want to fully commit.  Mussels - great and definitely worth ordering!  The mussels are extra large so you don't get as many pieces as usual.  The broth is unique with a coconut curry flavor and perfectly toasted bread for dipping.    Kale Salad - moved into my top 3 in phoenix!  I'm a big fan of kale salads and I've tried them all.  This kale salad falls in line after LGO and True Food.  It has pears, roasted tomatoes and bread crumbs to add the perfect finishing touch.    I hope this helps guide you a little and avoid menu anxiety at ZuZu! The rest of the menu looks equally amazing but I didn't have the space to try it all.  I'm looking forward to going back for brunch very soon to try the bloody mary bar and red velvet waffles!"}
{"text":"I came here for Arizona Restaurant Week and it was absolutely delicious. You need to try it out the food. The cooks made it very delicious and the service is amazing. I know it's kind of pricey but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Just came from the ZuZu.....ended my Christmas Day w / a fine Bailey's & Coffe made just right !  Nice folks in the lounge; great staff working hard to ensure everyone else has a good time....."}
{"text":"Great retro ambiance. Food and service both excellent.  Seared ahi tuna app was the best I've ever had.  Excellent apps and cocktails, and the braised short ribs with glazed carrots were delicious as well."}
{"text":"What a delicious new menu! There's a new executive chef in town and the food on this new menu was incredible! We had a large group (10) and they were very accommodating. There is a bar area, a medium in door area and a rather large outdoor seating space. We came in for a birthday dinner and everyone was impressed with what they ate! I had the foie gras and the brussel sprouts! I was able to share both and still had plenty to eat. I tasted the lobster grits as well. I highly recommend getting! The service was great, the food was great and the ambiance was relaxing, yet chic. We had a night we'll never forget. At the end they were able to split the checks for us and gave the birthday girl a very cute dessert with a candle. I'll be back to try more food for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food choices for AZ Restaurant Week. The burrata appetizer was amazing. The scottish salmon was also excellent, great flavor. And last but certainly not least, the chocolate dessert was very tasty, and the right size portion after a big meal.   We sat outside which was nice, but a bit loud at times when two groups of somewhat drunk people sat down nearby to drink some more. I guess that's what you expect from this hotel and it certainly looks like it can be the scene. The inside of the restaurant looked cool and I think that's where we'll sit next time for a quieter dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to Café Zuzu a handful of times now... mostly for drinks, once for dinner, and most recently for breakfast.  I've never been disappointed and I'm sure I'll continue to be a frequent customer, especially since I'm now living so close-by in Old Town!    I recall that they have some tasty martinis on the menu, but most recently I enjoyed a glass of Cakebread Sauv Blanc - you can never go wrong with that!  Chef Chuck Wiley does a fantastic job in the kitchen as I've both dined in and experienced his culinary creations around town at some foodie events.    Since my latest experience at Café Zuzu was for breakfast, I have to dedicate a paragraph to that... wow!  I'm hesitant to share this since I don't know that I want the word out about this, but Café Zuzu's breakfast rocks!  I was there with Andrea R (the morning after the pARTy), and our meal was divine!  I was leaning toward ordering their wheat pancakes served with fruit butter and a side of egg whites but Andrea was torn between their yogurt and granola and the same pancakes... So, our waitress suggested we order both and share.  Sold!  She ended up bringing us each half portions of pancakes, egg whites, granola and yogurt - and the half portions were plenty!  The granola was some of the best I've had and everything else was pretty damn delicious too.  I washed mine down with coffee and water and Andrea had some OJ with hers... We sat outside for a while after we finished, talking, working, and taking in the fresh air.  The manager, Paul, came out to check on us, and he even helped me carry my computer inside once we decided we were ready to go...   Café Zuzu is especially convenient when staying at the Valley Ho, but I now see it as a local dining destination as well.  I'm already looking forward to that granola for breakfast next time I visit!"}
{"text":"I've been there for happy hour several times and the appetizers and drinks are always delicious. I also love the 60 's modern decor and the fact that it's in a old hotel that used to be frequented by quite a few celebrities from Hollywood's golden age."}
{"text":"I have mixed reviews on this place so the stars reflect the positive and negative of my experiences. The good Bartender: amazing pours, great price for the glass and quick to serve.  Food: really good, there wasn't much after three sittings that I didn't like a little pricey but quality matched it  The bad:  Service, all of the experiences were poor and demonstrated a lack of direction and training. First experience, totally ignored after being seated but table next to us had drinks before we were acknowledged. Drinks were forgotten then partially served. Then finally received the food which was great!  Had to ask for service, silverware, cleared our own plates, asked to have the order taken 2x manager noticed it (after we cleared) and helped but didn't say a darn thing."}
{"text":"Had to get the kale salad again, I just needed it.  I LOVE that salad! My Mom had the truffle grilled cheese and it was outstanding! I wasn't a fan of the twice cooked fries, they ended up being dried out.  Our waitresses were so friendly, and free valet was such a plus!"}
{"text":"As hotel restaurants go, this is a great one. Funky vibe, really friendly service and good food. The bacon wrapped dates were delicious. And, by checking in on Yelp we got free dessert. An AMAZING milkshake with an Oreo the size of your fist!"}
{"text":"While I never know what to expect from a hotel restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised by how good of experiences I had at ZuZu. At the hotel for four days, I had breakfast here twice, and also enjoyed lunch on two separate occasions (though at the pool rather than in the restaurant itself). All meals were pretty dang tasty, and the price was right.   Let me tell you this: I am pretty obsessed with eggs benedict. When I saw the California Benedict ($13.00) on the ZuZu breakfast menu, I knew its destiny was to be in my belly. In liue of the traditional canadian bacon, it is served with avocado, tomato and spinach. While I guess you could argue that this makes it healthier (and thus more 'California' than a typical benny), when I scraped every last drop of decadent hollandaise off of my plate I certainly didn't feel like it was health food. Instead, I was indulging in one of the bests benedicts I've enjoyed in recent memory. It was so good, I had it for both breakfasts  For my poolside lunches I tried two different meals: The Famous ZuZu Burger ($12.50) and their turkey club. the ZuZu burger was stellar, with crispy bacon, balsamic onions and Maytag bleu cheese. It was cooked pretty much to my liking (maybe a TOUCH over the requested medium rare) and made me a very happy camper. Served with pesto mayo, the turkey club ($12.00) was good but not really all that memorable. I opted to upgrade to fries on the side, which cost me $2. I thought that was pretty weak, as fries are such a basic side, and they weren't fantastic fries by any means.   Service seemed fine at the restaurant, though sometimes a bit inattentive. I mean, nothing to get worried about and it's probably good for me to be reminded to slow down on occasion, but still sometimes I just want the check, you know?   As with everything at hotel Valley Ho, I'm ultimately quite impressed with ZuZu and look forward to being able to return."}
{"text":"*** Do not go for anything other than Saturday/Sunday brunch and early evening drinks unless you enjoy overpaying for drab food and you love disappointment. ***  That was for the \"short reviews\" crowd as that will be the central theme of this review and the most important point when discussing Cafe ZuZu, which is the gorgeous space inside of the Hotel Valley Ho.  ZuZu's brunch is absolutely fantastic, rife with comfort foods and thick cut bacon and midwestern-inspired dishes from kitchens with rosy colored grandmothers.  Its what I would imagine, in the matter of setting, decor and nourishment, Frank Lloyd Wright would sit down to every morning and gaze out into the world.  In the case of Cafe ZuZu, one is able to watch out of the glass paned wall into the area of the 50s inspired patio and pool area.  The bloody mary is very serviceable.  Not the best I've ever had, but very delicious to go along with fruit topped french toast.  And again, that bacon!  After brunch long passes, is another good time to re-enter into ZuZu .. for evening drinks on the patio.  With firepits roaring on chilly nights, its a very pleasant setting for a group of friends intent on a mellow night of chatting.  No ones gonna blow it out here, but its a nice spot to grab wine, beer, or specialty cocktails (which, come to discover taste like Pine-Sol and shit).    Anyway, ZuZu is a pretty unique spot in that you can start both your morning and your evening there before romping around Old Town."}
{"text":"Cool hotel bar in a cool hotel.  Get a booth and enjoy the crowd.  Be sure to get a cocktail or four at the hotel lobby bar before dinner during happy hour.  Cool place and glad we checked this place out."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and certainly recommended as a must see and do when in Scottsdale. The atmosphere can be best described as 60's retro. I highly recommend the Beef Stroganoff. Our server, Kate, was the best part of our meal."}
{"text":"In reply to Jesse T.:  I actually have been to the Friday night happy hour and really enjoyed it. Same great food, fun band by the pool AND it was a romantic ambiance with the fires going. Thanks for the reminder!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my friend.  We both had couldn't locate the parking lot, so we parked on the streets (no big deal).  This place is cool...blast into the 50's or 60's!  I walked to the back and was greeted by the hostess (super sweet and friendly).  I was seated and glazed over the menu.  Lots of yummy choices.  The server swung by to check on me since I was still waiting for my friend.  She took my drink order and bought it to me ASAP.  My friend came and we decided to each order a breakfast dish and then split a dessert.  So I got the two eggs any style (scrambled), sausage, potatoes, and wheat toast.  And we split a stuff French toast.  Everything was good.  The French toast was awesome!  Only con was the server kept trying to refill my ice tea with ice brew.  It happened 2 of the 3 times.  I did not even bother to say something the 3rd time.  But I would come back!"}
{"text":"We were not impressed. I searched in the surrounding area for truffle fries and was recommended this restaurant that I have been meaning to dine at.  However, they no longer offered truffle fries on the menu.  I called the manager before heading to the bar, and he said they would accommodate our craving and make them.  We arrived at the bar, which needed much updating to improve the ambiance.  It felt like a 5 and Diner.  I thought this was the Valley Ho? We were intending on dining for a full course lunch as well, but after the out dated exterior and interior, we no longer felt comfortable at Zuzu.  We had one round of drinks and the special-requested truffle fries, and were reassured of our initial impression of the restaurant, to leave.    The service was attentive, the cocktail/ wine list was adequate, and I have to give credit to the chef for making the truffle fries that are no longer featured on the menu. I wish the specially-made fries were impressionable, like the other reviewers felt from a few years back, but they were not.  I will not be back!  Best of luck to Valley Ho and Zuzu.  I believe updates and renovations are in dire need."}
{"text":"We enjoyed several meals here and EVERY single time, our service has been absolutely incredible and the food and drinks we've received have been nothing short of fabulous!  I think if you are in a rush (or want to keep your drinks coming), sitting at the bar is an excellent option because the bartenders are very attentive! If you like blueberry muffins, they make a killer homemade muffin and it's HUGE with a very small price tag  (only $3.50).  Sunday late morning- we headed down for brunch, only to find a super talented musical duo playing really chill music- what a treat!  The chicken sandwich with Asiago cheese will thrill your taste buds and if you are staying at the valley ho- do yourself a favor and head down to eat at ZuZu in lieu of room service. Same food but way different quality- the in person experience totally trumps all"}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food, intimate setting.    I had gift cards from the Play2Stay deal with Hotel Valley Ho.  The $30 towards food and drink went a long way! The menu includes appetizers, main dishes, and desserts.  The apps range from $6-12 or so, the main courses are up to $25 or so, and desserts were around $6-12.   Everything we ordered was super tasty!    Location: Inside Hotel Valley Ho. There's self-parking and valet.  The restaurant is in the tower, under the fitness center.   Food:  The meal we ordered included grilled asparagus, a spaghetti squash dish, drinks and dessert.  The grilled asparagus with parm cheese was made just right with a bit of cheese and salt.   The spaghetti squash dish had cheese, tomatoes, and other vegetables and was made quite well.   For dessert, I tasted a strawberry shake which was delicious and fresh.  I ordered a dessert wine that was sweet and smooth. Other options included pies, other flavors of shakes, etc.   We ordered a margarita and a martini. The martini was some sort of strawberry with  a hint of jalapeno. It sounds odd but was a nice mix.   Service: The restaurant was not really happening on a Sunday night at 7:30 PM, but the server was super attentive, friendly and helpful.    Ambiance:  Retro decor with little booths and tables. The cafe includes outdoor seating."}
{"text":"My family enjoyed our breakfast here today. The excellent service starts when you pull up to the valet stand: the valets are friendly and ZuZu's hostess makes sure you get your parking ticket validated. In the restaurant, service is prompt and attentive. Our water glasses and coffee cups never sat empty.  My Eggs Benedict entree was prepared perfectly, and my family was content with their choices as well. My son loved the seasoning on his roasted potatoes in particular. We ordered one plate of Cinnamon Roll Donut Bombs for the table, and my lord - they were amazing! I would not recommend eating them by yourself, as they're quite rich and decadent, but they are full of cinnamon goodness! Good stuff, all around!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and had an enjoyable meal but today was a 1-star experience!  Service was poor.  We wanted to order the breakfast burrito, but the waiter said he thought they were out of the green chile pork but would check for us.  He didn't check, they just brought out the burrito without the main ingredient.  No breakfast scones that they're supposed to serve on Sundays, we had to ask for them.  No refills on coffee or water.    The kicker for me was when I tried to change my 1-year-old son in the bathroom, and there was no baby changer.  My husband checked the men's bathroom and there wasn't any in there either.  I asked the hostess where I could find a bathroom with a baby changer and she said: \"we don't have one, this is usually a place for adults.   But you can just change him on the couch in the ladies bathroom.\" Ummmm ok.  If you have a kids menu and high chairs then you should assume a baby will need a diaper change at some point.  It seems silly to me to not provide a baby changer in the bathroom stall because you're such a high class adult destination but then you'd rather me change my baby on a plush couch in the ladies room in full view of people trying to wash their hands.  Wtf! Also the whole point of the changer is that there's a strap so the baby can't roll off.  It's not safe for her to be suggesting to change a baby on an elevated surface where you can't secure them and they can fall off.  We most likely won't be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"A great brunch experience!  A friend and I came for Sunday brunch around noon and were quickly seated. They have a very nice outdoor patio, which was unfortunately full so we sat inside. Cute, retro ambiance!! A very unique interior, and one of the highlights as other reviewers mentioned.  We had the mimosa bar, which was so fun! They give you a glass of champagne and you pick the juice (peach, orange, strawberry) and condiments. They also have a bloody Mary bar with even more choices which looked fun. They also have free chocolate chip scones to start which were delicious!  I got the Frittata and my friend had the Arizona omelette and it was good - she loved the potatoes and thought they were well seasoned. I loved the frittata!! It came with tons of veggies and was so flavorful. By the way, prices are super reasonable - mimosa bar was $8 and generous portions. Food is comparable to other places in the area.  Service was a tad slow but otherwise we had a great experience, and would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and had a great meal. Loved the decor and the staff was very friendly. Portions were reasonable in that we were full when we left, but didn't feel uncomfortable.   I ordered the red velvet waffle and it was perfect! They topped it with fresh strawberries and raspberries and weren't skimpy with the fruit.   I usually don't comment on the bathroom, but it was also very well kept--clean, nice soap and lotion, and little towels to dry your hands!"}
{"text":"It's a hotel bar, so you might not even need to read the review. This is a complex 3-star rating.   This place is a bit different than the regular hotel bars that people in Arcadia/N.Scottsdale seem to frequent. Mid-century modern architecture is nice to look at, and I could tell my girlfriend liked being in a fancier place for once.   The happy hour is pretty great. And by great, I mean it moves the restaurant fare into an affordable hemisphere. Drinks become less than ten dollars and you can get some grilled vegetables for about six bucks more. Anything beyond appetizers will set you back dearly, but the cooking staff seemed to be competent (even though I wouldn't know, I only had some grilled veggies.)   The hotel does a little wine-tasting/chef meeting event that costs about 60 bucks per person but would be really cool for people looking to do more than just pay out the nose for drinks and a steak elsewhere.   This place lost a star for the (can't believe I'm going to say this) behavior of the wait staff. I heard more than a few of the people talking shit about customers seated outside or at the other end of the bar, and chatting about their personal lives with each other. I'm all about hating on dress codes and regulations at work, but you should know if the place you work at charges twelve bucks for a cocktail, a little more is expected of you.   The bar has TV's but they are very poorly placed, just part of the difficulty of transforming an older spot into a newer attraction I suppose.   If you aren't staying at the hotel, there are plenty of places I'd rather hit in the area."}
{"text":"Going to Cafe ZuZu at the Hotel Valley Ho was like hopping aboard Michael J. Fox's Delorean and traveling Back to the Future.  Back to the 70's to a simpler time, when life was beautiful all the time!    I loved the retro styling of this hotel!  It was intentional retro, not worn out dated retro.  The furnishings in Cafe ZuZu reminded me of the Jetsons!  But the ambiance reminded me of old time Hollywood.  I half expected Frank Sinatra to sit down next to me and sing me a song.  I was there to meet my new friend Gabi for lunch, and I must say, we had a wonderful time.  I had read up on Cafe ZuZu before going so I had kind of an idea of what to look for.   And I wanted to say that I was confused about some of the mixed reviews because being a foodie who is almost fanatical about fresh food and clean comfortable surroundings, I was very impressed.  The restaurant was very clean.  Someone before had mentioned stains on booths, etc.  There was no such thing anywhere I could see.  The booth was clean and comfortable.  There were no crumbs, sticky spots, or fingerprints anywhere!  Very relaxing!  The servers were right on top of things too!  Very friendly and helpful.  I was a little early and they didn't make me wait until my party got there.  I hate that when restaurants do that.  They let me sit, they served me, and they were very gracious.  Gabi got there shortly and we were quickly served.  We both decided on the Ahi Tuna salad and boy was it fabulous!  Fresh ahi, lightly seared on the edges, perfect pink in the inside.  It was so delicious it melted in my mouth.  The greens were fresh too, just like they were just picked, and the dressing was just right.  Perfect for the tuna.  I loved this salad, and I am very picky about Ahi.  I also was impressed by the rolls that they served.  They were not hot, I'm not sure if they were supposed to be, but they were yeasty, fresh and melted in my mouth too.  I noticed that the tops of them were browned and salted like a fresh pretzel.  It made for a very enjoyable roll.  I would have eaten all of them, but I was trying to be polite!  :)  Well I wouldn't have eaten quite ALL of them!  I think the only thing you should be aware of is that there is no off-street parking, you need to valet park.  The valet's were friendly and fast.  But if you're not comfortable with valet parking, prepare to walk around the block or across a busy street.  We loved our lunch and Cafe ZuZu and would highly recommend it.  It's a must see stop on a trip to Scottsdale, or just for a great lunch in Old Town!    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best hotel restaurant and bar I've ever been to. They have a somlier Sandra who can pair any wine, a mixologist Greg, who can make some amazing cocktails off the cuff. The food is always of high quality and easy to adjust to your liking. Anna , Lo and Kelly are great bartenders and are always attentive and friendly!!!! They also always make my dog feel friendly Mandy always gets him water and attention. I'd highly recommend  dinner or  a drink anytime!!"}
{"text":"Cafe Zuzu, you've captured my attention. I've stayed at the HO a number of times and absolutely LOVE it, but hadn't dined at ZUZU. This time I finally did it, unfortunately the place was packed with spring breakers and the food service was slower than molasses, but we didn't let that ruin our morning and neither did our server, who quickly remembered my parents, who visit the VH often on their overnight trips to PHX. Anyway. What's not to love about their Classic All-American menu with delectable items ranging from healthy to not so healthy. And how about that Bloody Mary bar? Although I didn't partake in the Bloody Mary activities it was certainly fun to watch all the spring breakers curing their hangovers. Bottom line, the bar looks bomb. Next time, Mary! They've got all meals covered here: breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks and happy hour.  There's nothing better than enjoying a meal in an awesome setting, and VH offers that too. It's a hip and modernized retro kind of place. It's comfortable and relaxing. You can sit indoors or out on the patio.   I opted for a healthy breakfast and regret not ordering the eggs benedict, but a two hour ride home followed breakfast and I didn't want to go home with a full stomach, so next Benny! My two sunny side up eggs with quite possibly some of the best breakfast potatoes ever, were perfect. Smoked salmon on the side was tasty too. My cappuccino was less than perfect, but I've had coffee at ZUZU before and have never been impressed, so no shocker there.  I love VH, so I love ZUZU too. Even though it took about forty minutes for our simple breakfast to come out....I forgive you....it was CRAZY packed. I can't wait for my next visit. Saving room for the bloody mary bar and eggs benedict."}
{"text":"I stopped in here to order a beverage while my friends were enjoying the live tunes at the poolside happy hour. Fast service and tasty beverage."}
{"text":"While I was staying at the Hotel Valley Ho, ZuzZu became my mini-office and my home base for some breakfast comfort-food.   The decor here, as in the rest of the hotel, is really late 50's/early 60's influenced. I love the look of everything from the chairs to the coffee mugs. The outdoor area has bright orange umbrellas and sweet little potted flowers adorning each table.   I only had breakfast options, but each hit the spot. My first day, I had their home made granola w/cranberries and apricots, with yogurt on the side. The granola was really top notch, and the dried fruit was plentiful, no searching for it among the grains. The second morning, I opted for the strawberry waffles, which were nice and fluffy. I don't make big demands of my waffles -- they just have to be hot and right texture -- and these were juuust right.  In addition tot he strawberries, they also came with an orange curd, which I ordered on the side -- a really nice touch!  I'm not sure if the orange or pineapple juice that I had was fresh-squeezed.  I somehow don't think that it was, but was tasty nonetheless.  My servers both days were extremely attentive and sweet.    I really loved the fact that the hotel's free wi-fi worked here.  It make it a great spot to work while eating, and also to sit in on/host meetings. The only downfall in this department was the lack of outlets.  However, they probably don't want you whiling away your whole afternoon there, even if you *are* a hotel guest, so perhaps that's for the best!"}
{"text":"Located inside the Hotel Valley Ho, this small restaurant is a pretty cool joint to grab some breakfast.  We've come here several times.  We enjoy the following items:  Eggs Benedict, $12 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-zuzu-scottsdale-2?select=fe0MFm8S3H5mgZTQVPs7mw#fe0MFm8S3H5mgZTQVPs7mw  Denver Omelet, $12 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-zuzu-scottsdale-2?select=pGs1BJd4W0XzHK0uGzeYng#pGs1BJd4W0XzHK0uGzeYng  There's something about the decor of this place which I would describe as \"retro cool\".  Service is so/so, but generally good most of the time.  Return Factor - 75%"}
{"text":"How fantastic is this restaurant!? I guess you're reading this review to find out. Let me tell you, it's the most fantastic-est ever! Hotel Valley Ho describes itself as  \"mid-century modern\" and \"urban,\" which you'll agree with once you experience the wonderful architecture, furnishings, and brilliant colors all about. ZuZu is no exception to the theme. From their bar to their patio umbrellas to their coffee mugs, you'll fall in love with the warm, retro vibe going on.   Now this menu isn't cheap, but it isn't crazy pricey either. They feature fresh and local produce when possible, and the menu revolves around classic American favorites \"with a modern twist.\" You'll find everything from gourmet sandwiches, to burgers, to beef stroganoff, to filet mignon, to casseroles. Great wine menu as well, in addition to classic and original cocktails. The breakfast menu is equally as phenomenal with gorgeous omelets, pancakes, french toast, salmon and more.   Let me tell you about what I ordered. For breakfast, I went with the gluten free french toast which was 100% incredible. It's stuffed with lemon cream-cheese (just a hint of lemon, nothing crazy) and topped with fresh berries and maple syrup. Good god. It was breathtaking! I also had a mushroom omelet which was stuffed with spinach and sharp cheddar cheese... can't go wrong there. I had GF toast on the side with ZuZu's house made apricot jelly. Delish. For dinner, I enjoyed the roasted spaghetti squash. Don't knock it til you try it... Have you ever had spaghetti squash? It's amazing and served atop braised greens, tomatoes, and covered in a Parmesan crust and toasted pine nuts. Does that not sound like perfection? Because it is.  Make sure you come in the evening and sit outside by the enormous fire. There are plenty of couches and the service here at ZuZu is outstanding. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"This place is great for any meal but my wife and I have been hitting their breakfast and lunch often. I LOVE the short rib hash breakfast dish. Fantastic. One of the best burgers in the valley.....very underrated! Fries are to die for. Fun to people watch but it's the food that keeps us coming back. My wife likes many items also but seems to be drawn to their salads and believe it or not the oatmeal."}
{"text":"Inside the Valley Ho Hotel, the place was fancy schmancy. But the servers were friendly. The atmosphere was quiet and intimate. Definitely the spot to unwind after a long day.  Chicken Quesadilla (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RTegy5CUBpMK65pr8UeDgA?select=Sl3cwHn--wpqAXfsMr3jPw): For a bar bite, it was quite big. Generous amount of ingredients. The flavors were simple. Chicken meat, cheese and mango salsa. I supposed $10 was not bad for hotel cafe food.  Ahi Tuna Slider (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RTegy5CUBpMK65pr8UeDgA?select=qW3r3Z4PoNj-PDYQuWaaNQ) The slider, on the other hand, was not worth it at all. $8.50 for one slider and couple pieces of squash. My friend finished her meal within 5 minutes.  Not a bad option if you want a quick bite around this area."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the valley ho!  I decided to surprise my partner with a weekend staycation and dinner.  The shrimp cocktail is awesome! Their cocktail sauce has a nice kick and super flavorful.  The basic green salad was dressed perfectly and was refreshing.  I loved my Cornish hen. They butterflied it for a beautiful presentation. My partner had the stroganoff and was pleased. I didn't get to taste because I was super excited about my dish.  The huckleberry creme brûlée was silky, tart and sweet. I loved it!  The only reason for the lack of a star was because of the service. It wasn't horrible, but lackluster. Our server didn't even ask if we wanted dessert and just brought the check and we had to request the dessert menu. The table next to us had much better service, but they also had a different server."}
{"text":"They call this mid century modern. A 1950 era throwback and exactly as described. We only had the pleasure of dining here for Sunday brunch but it was well worth the experience. My red velvet waffle should be considered illegal it was so good! Hubby had a spinach omelet with real spinach not packaged. I definitely want to take a tour they offer of the hotel, rooms and grounds for the throwback price of 19.56 so we will be arranging this for another time. It's not just a hotel but an adventure.  Where is my turquoise chevy with the back fins? I felt like I was in a Pan Am movie and wanted to see those 1950 beauties around.  Our first visit but certainly not our last!"}
{"text":"Ok, I might be a little biased with this one. Only because I live right across the street and I would hate for any staff that know me from being there 5-6 days a week see a so-so review when I'm sure they have more than one incriminating incident to share about my frequent stumbles home from such great happy hours or late night keep-the-party-going visits. Anyway...  The food is outstanding, drinks are delicious, different and reasonably priced, and the bar tenders (who at this point are friends) are fun to be around. Definitely a cool/swanky place to unwind. The boyfriend seems to like to grab lunch on saturday afternoons when the pool party is going on. Wonder why. You're welcome, gentlemen.   Stop in for the Blackened Shrimp, the Tuscan Kale Salad, or some happy hour apps. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"The pictures on their website make this place look like an upscale classy restaurant. We sat outside because it was a beautiful night. There outside dining is more like poolside cafe which wouldn't be bad if the food could have won me over. My date and I both ordered the filet medium rare. We both appreciate and know a prime cut of filet. Filets should be mouthwatering tender, almost melting in your mouth. Filets are one of the leanest cuts of meat. This cut had quite a bit of gristle which makes me believe it wasn't a filet. Filets are thick. This cut was thin. To make it worse ZuZu's cooked the steak medium well.  On a positive note. The staff was very nice!! I told them about my steak so they cooked a new one to bring home and did not charge me for the steak. Very much appreciated!! Sadly, I won't go back for dining."}
{"text":"We ate here twice this past weekend with a group of friends, once for dinner/happy hour and once for breakfast.  First off - the happy hour menu is unbelievably cheap; $3 specialty cocktails/wine/sparkling wine.  I think between the lot of us we tried every drink on the specialty menu.  My favorites were the Bramble, with gin, lemon & blackberry, and the Ho-Hattan with bourbon, vermouth & bitters.  YUM.  We had a divine grilled cheese sandwich w/ tomato soup for only $5, and the cheese plate was also great.  For breakfast I had the ZuZu breakfast casserole which was topped with the most perfectly poached egg I've ever had.  The level of attention to detail in the food here is incredible - they think of everything.   My only complaint is that a few of the servers were a bit snooty and not very attentive.  We went stretches of approximately 20 minutes without anyone stopping by.  But we think we figured out the problem....there was a female manager working when we first sat down who was SUPER bitchy.....an hour or so later she appeared to have ended her shift and suddenly EVERY server was super cheerful and awesome....hmmm.  We had a server at breakfast who was one of the best I've ever had; wish I would have gotten her name.  EDIT*** I just realized I forgot to mention my FAVORITE part!!!  You HAVE to order a side of grits for breakfast.  They're unreal.  I've never been a big grits fan because of texture issues but these were amazing.  Apparently mascarpone is involved....off I go to attempt a recreation!  :)"}
{"text":"My darling SO just looooooves this place, supposedly because they have a BLT that comes with avocado and a half-cooked egg on it. Ummm... OK. When he finally dragged me here, I realized he probably likes it because the waitresses hit on him. (Honeybuns, if you're reading this, they'll do anything for a tip. ANYthing...!?)  I got a veggie egg white omelet, which had all my favorite components of caramelized onions and broccolini, but it tasted as if they had sauteed the veggies in the drippings from the burgers that just came off the grill. Uh, gross. This alone takes the rating to two stars, and I'm not even a super-strict vegetarian. It's just disgusting. The English muffin was this weird little hockey puck that really served no purpose other than to serve as a vehicle for the tasty, homemade apricot preserves that came on the side. The chocolate cherry scones were delish and the coffee quite good.  The booth next to us held three 20-somethings (two dudes and a chick) downing mimosas, still wasted from the night before, who thought it fun to play their cell phones and/or iPods at high volumes. Just annoying as shit. Later, when I visited the swanky bathrooms, I saw the girl out crying in the lobby. Guess the swordfight didn't end well.  I'll go back, so my SO can continue to get his ego stroked and his cholesterol raised, but I'm staying away from things from the grill..."}
{"text":"Delicious food, thoughtfully prepared, in a cool, retro environment with fun, friendly staff.   This time we came for brunch, which doesn't disappoint. We got the Short rib hash and florentine frittata, both of which were seriously yummy! Their breakfast quesadilla is our usual favorite, but we went outside the box and tried new yummy things. I can't think of anything I've had that isn't good, but I also know that they'll gladly exchange something if you don't like it.   Love their Build your own Bloody Bar on the weekend! $5, you choose your liquor, and them build away! Delicious and a fun experience :)   We've also done their happy hour here - $3 champagne! $5 food! Fun crowd! One of my favorite different happy hours in town.   They offer a Monday night Chefs Table once a month as well. Although the price seems steep at first, it's a really neat experience. For $52 (the last time we did it) a person, you get a four-course meal, designed around the featured winery or brewery for the month. Representatives from the winery tell you about the wines you'll be having, and Chef Wiley and Chef Sean explain the food choices as well all in all, an intimate exclusive feeling night.   I've recommended Cafe Zuzu to a lot of people from out of town, and they just plain don't disappoint."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at Cafe ZuZu.  We had so much food with a fantastic wine and wonderful service.    Our meal consisted of short ribs with mashed potatoes, beef stroganoff with sour cream, double friend french fries, brussel sprouts, and truffled mashed potatoes.  (I see \"truffle\" and usually I have to order it.)    Everything was cooked very well and we just HAD to share.  Did I mention that the service was excellent?    The decor is not my style, but done well and it was a very nice evening with good company."}
{"text":"Love the ZuZu.  Everything from the atmosphere to the food.  Not to mention their awesome happy hour -- pretty sure it goes until 7 pm, which is longer than most in Scottsdale.    My fiance and I live down the street from ZuZu, but never tried it out for the longest time as it's connected to the Valley Ho Hotel and semi-hidden.  I wish we would have tried it sooner to know what we were missing.  They have something for everyone whether you want a fun cocktail, an appetizer or a full meal.  We always eat in the bar area - it has a great retro vibe with funky chairs and fun wall decor.  I'm a fan of their bramble (gin + lemon & blackberry) and the sangria.  At happy hour, their drinks are only $5.  As for food, I love their seasoned fries, I believe they have some sort of garlic powder on them, and they are served with a delicious chipotle aioli.  Very difficult to stop eating the fries once you start.  I also loove the chicken quesadilla, which comes stuffed with mango and jalapenos + sides of sour cream, guac & salsa - amazing combination!  The burger is also pretty killer.  Be sure to get the one with bacon and BBQ sauce, it's finger-licking good.    My fiance and I have only had dinner at the ZuZu once, we tend to keep it as a happy hour spot.  If you're looking for a fun place to start your evening, or to unwind after work, check out Cafe ZuZu!    PS - Wine Wednesdays are also a great hit for HH.  The first time my fiance and I ever visited ZuZu was on a Wednesday, and they were serving Silver Oak for only $5 a glass.  If you know anything about wine, you know that Silver Oak is a very nice wine, sold at Costco for at least $75 a bottle, or upwards of $150 a bottle at a restaurant.  $5 a glass at ZuZu was insane and probably what started our love affair with the joint."}
{"text":"This was a blast from the past! Not only is this a great option for people staying at the hotel connected to it (which gave me complimentary valet service!) it has a great atmosphere and food to boot!            I met my former Yelp boss, Aimee K, for breakfast here this morning and absolutely loved the vintage retro vibe. I was waiting for go-go dancers, a disco ball and some Saturday Night Fever, but seeing Aimee was good enough for me!          Service can be a wee bit slow, but we were also chatting up a storm and I think she was trying to give us time to catch some air in between sentences.     The coffee was good and refills with this and water were endless and attentive. I ordered the Garden Fresh Veggie Omelet with egg whites and must say it was pretty splendid! The oven roasted tomatoes were so sweet and literally burst in my mouth while the squash and basil complimented the goat cheese very nicely. The goat cheese was whip-like, super creamy and oozed out tastily.        The breakfast potatoes were delicious, but I only let myself have a couple (trying to behave around my obsession with food is difficult!) And this also comes with toast and homemade preserves.        This should not be overlooked simply because it is connected to a hotel, this restaurant brings its own awesomeness to the table!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful time at Cafe Zulu, which is located within the Hotel Valley Ho. I think the 'Cafe' part throws me off tho, because I feel it's more of a lounge/bar with very mod-esque decor; something that reminds you of a scene out of The Jetsons.  They have a great happy hour menu that lists a range of appetizers from Bruschetta, Prime rib dip w/au jus, to a handful of signature drinks and domestic beers for only $3 a piece. It's a great deal!  The Chef who works for the Valley Ho and who happened to be creating these tasty appetizers, came out and introduce himself asked if everything tasted good and if he could do anything for us, while our waitress was very cool and insightful on the drinks and appetizers as well. Now that's what I call great service. You can't beat a $3 happy hour menu"}
{"text":"We had a GREAT breakfast at ZZ.  Patio is wonderful and food was equally good.  Apple pancakes, French toast, breakfast sandwich and the Mexican dish were all great.  Service was a little slow but it was lovely morning so who really cares?!?  Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great experience at the bar!! The seasonal mule was delicious, and so was my husband's Rye whiskey beverage. We also shared their peanut butter cheesecake, and that was yummy. Will be returning!!"}
{"text":"Daahhling, I'll have a gin and tonic. If you don't feel fabulous here, then you don't have any imagination.   I love the decor, it's fun to hang out here and have drinks at night. I've also had breakfast here before too, it was pretty good and certainly a different feel from the saucy evening there before, but it still had the same effect on me, that I was ab-fab.   Hanging out by the pool is fun too, smaller than I thought it would be though. (that's what she said)"}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend & I's new favorite place for date night. We had the best meal we have both ever eaten here & the service is always spectacular! They treat us like royalty down there, and always make sure to get the Showstopper shake for dessert!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's super cute, great drinks (I always get the Ricky Ricardo) and good food. I literally go here every year for my birthday, I've tried to change venues but I can't seem to rip myself away from this place. My only complaint is that they no longer serve the meatloaf... As far as meatloaf goes, it was pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Another comfort place for me. Cafe Zuzu/Valley Ho, I can say, was my first hospitality love in Arizona.   The food is always delicious. I am a huge fan of comfort and seasonal which Zuzu never disappoints on either.   The atmosphere is always chill and the staff goes above and beyond to make you feel like royalty.   They do a great brunch, have nice outdoor seating, delicious cocktails, and beautiful grounds. You will not be disappointed with your experience here."}
{"text":"Went here the other night after work - fantastic Happy Hour menu! The grilled cheese sammy and tomato soup for $5 was spectacular! And, $3 Pomegranite Fizzes? Ummm, YUMMM!! Great service and retro/hipster ambience - I live in the area but would love to stay in one of their hotel rooms at some point. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The dining area was hoppin on this Monday night, and I figure it must be due to the chef's tasting dinner with wine pairings.  Kick ass and only $42.  If I was hungry enough, I totally would've done it.  Hell, I almost did anyway. Instead me and my lonesome moseyed up to the bar for some basketball and beer.  Serious comfort food menu, and I've gotta say, this weirds me out in such hot climates.  I feel like it should be all Mexican food or salads and fish dishes to combat the weather.  When it's 83 degrees out, do you really want blue cheese fondue or beef stroganoff?  Gross. Since it was only 60something, I opted for the ZuZu burger.  This is not a shy burger my friends.  In fact, when the bartender set it down and I lifted up the top bun, the burger jumped up and karate kicked me in the throat.  Serious.  Blue cheese and onions and bacon and SALT (duh).  What's a burger without fries, and these folks reeled me right in with their \"twice fried\" crispy critters.  Super super hot and crispy (and salty, gah, are you trying to give me a stroke?) upon arrival, some of the crisp faded away once they sat around for a while. I'd absolutely give this place another shot, there were so many yummy looking things on the menu that I had to go with my panic burger (\"Ah, what should I get?!  I've been staring at the menu for 15 minutes and the bartender has already given me suggestions and JUST PICK SOMETHING ALREADY!!!!!!!\" - you know how it is)."}
{"text":"Meh... While the atmosphere is kinda cool and retro, they really miss up the vibe by playing techno music as opposed to period (1950'sand 60's). Also, Lo (aka: #216) is just about the rudest and most unfriendly bartender I've ever encountered--just downright ornery. When I gently questioned the happy hour policy, she responded with a, \"Listen, Sweetheart...\" Her condescending attitude was ridiculous and inappropriate. When I asked her why she had the audacity to call me \"Sweetheart\" in a particularly terse tone, her response was that she calls all of her patrons by that name. Really? Is that what they taught you in bartending school, Lo? I think not. Should I just call you, \"Server 216.\" The only reason I didn't give just one star is because the food and drinks are decent. The service is terrible. It's sad... Valley Ho has been a local treasure."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is serious about his stroganoff so when he saw that Café Zuzu offered beef stroganoff our dinner was already set! I insisted on staying in the hotel for dinner because we were pretty tired from the drive (Palm Springs to AZ, approximately four hours) and we had bounced around the near by downtown area for lunch anyway. The place was quiet, but then again, it was also a Sunday night. Café Zuzu had a nice romantic ambiance to it. Kind of dark and the booths were put up against the wall, facing out to the dining room so it had a cool lounge feel to it too.  The service was really good. Our server was knowledgeable, patient, and friendly. I couldn't make up my mind about what I wanted to eat and she was very patient and helpful with helping me make my decision. She explained the way things were cooked and what they were served with. I settled with sharing the stroganoff with my boyfriend and we ordered two sides; onion rings and mac and cheese. First the stroganoff; OMG I cannot wait to go back and have it again. I am a seriously serious mushroom fan and the mushrooms in the stroganoff were HUGE and perfectly cooked. The meet in it was filet and it was tendered and cooked to perfection. I could have done without the sour cream on top because the sauce was perfect in itself. As for the mac and cheese, that was amazingly delicious as well! The three different cheeses gave it an adult indulgence type of mac and cheese flavor. The three cheeses they chose (I'm not sure which cheeses the used) to mix were flavored in perfect harmony. I'm so glad I picked it! The onion rings were good too. Nothing really special there. However the dipping sauce was pretty yummy. It was aioli something or rather. But I was incredibly with our choices at the Café Zuzu and we can't till we're back next year! PLEASE don't get rid of or change your stroganoff recipe!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Great food, superior service, gorgeous decor... I had a Breakfast Casserole and a generous side of Cheesy Grits. My girlfriend had the Blue Plate Special which was a frittata.  The Breakfast Casserole is a medley of sausage, roasted vegetables, and potatoes with cheese, topped with a poached egg. There were no overwhelmingly strong or weak flavors, and I didn't see any extra oil in the dish. It came with a side of toast. I chose the marble rye and was disappointed only to see that the butter it came with was a hard stick. The grits were definetly made with milk and butter and had some cheddar cheese sprinkled across the top. The grits were more solid than watery which was a big plus for me, as I prefer my grits closer to the drier end of the spectrum.  After breakfast I ordered a bloody mary at the bar inside and it was spicy and delish, a really good balance of tomato to booze. I liked it a lot. What I liked the most, though, was the really good service and friendly attention we got from our server, the hostess, the bartender, the bar manager, the valet drivers, and even being greeted by the concierge and check-in when we weren't even staying at the hotel. I will definetly make it a point to come here again."}
{"text":"You can't beat the happy hour prices here ($3 beverages and food - and the portions are huge), but it wasn't out of this world for me. The decor was very old school 70's and it just felt like an outdated place. Our waitress was nice, but forgettable. I probably wouldn't come here again because there are so many other great happy hour places in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Had a wonder dining experience here this past weekend. We had never tried this quaint restaurant inside the Hotel Valley Ho before, but are so glad we did! Everything from the service, music and food exceeded our expectations. There was not one dinner dish that wasn't cooked perfectly, all appetizers were delicious! ZuZu is a 5 star restaurant with a more casual setting yet modern young vibe. We will be back again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Such a cool place!  We went for brunch and it was great.  Super atmosphere and the food was delish!  They had something for everyone."}
{"text":"Whether breakfast, lunch, or dinner, there is nothing that isn't great!! Chef Wylie and his staff will always put a smile on your face exquisite flavor on your taste buds. The patio is a great spot for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Love this place- awesome service and so many great options on the menu it's hard to choose!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Expensive, and not a lot of entree choices.  Will wait for awhile to go back."}
{"text":"Nice, quaint setting!  The Hubs and I really enjoyed. Food was delicious, rather small in portion size but still fulfilling!!  Live music A+ Definitely a bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Barely sat down and already disappointed with the service... We were completely ignored for at least 3 minutes and 7 minutes before we even got to order... Hopefully the food makes up for it... Especially because we are staying at this hotel for the weekend."}
{"text":"During a recent vacation in Phoenix we had both a casual dinner and lunch on the terrace at this restaurant. Both were outstanding. Service was excellent and cheerful. The food was totally appropriate. My wife and I would highly recommend sitting outside where umbrellas shaded us from the sun and kept things cool. Very nice restaurant in a very nice hotel!"}
{"text":"Travel Zoo has a fantastic offer right now. $35 for $50 in food and beverages. Alcohol is included. We went to brunch and Shane recommended the Breakfast burrito. It was amazing! You can't go wrong with green chili. Verg our bartender was very attentive as well, even though it was busy. They have a wonderful Bloody Mary and mimosa bar. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow, reminds me of Miami's hey days in the 80's. Great crowd, great music, great bartenders and OMG the best crispy pork bellies EVER!!!!  This is a chic bar/restaurant that has great ambiance, and a hip attitude. The food, well I just ordered the pork Belly, and it's like catholic miracle food, as I am cured of all my evils. I could eat 100 of those.   Zulu is located just steps from old town Scottsdale and within easy walking distance from everything.   I may become a regular."}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The atmosphere will put you into a completely different time warp! The food by Chef GARCIA is mouth watering! Trust me...order the MUSSELS!!!"}
{"text":"What a great brunch place.  You get to people watch if you sit on the patio. If you go late enough you can watch the douchebag parade as they come to the pool to be seen.  I have had the waffles as well as the BLT with egg and avacado and I loved them both. If you check in on Yelp, you get a free wine; but the waitress let's me swap for a mimosa. Score."}
{"text":"Here's what you need to know: I have an obsession for mid-century modern design and urban renewal projects. After reading local headlines about the multi-million dollar investment the new owners of the Valley Ho put into the place, I had to check it out.  I'm so glad I did. The hotel is gorgeous, inside and out. It's like going back in time to some very chic '50s Hollywood mansion. I felt underdressed. I should be more stylish to eat here or something.  Anyway, the food is amazing. I've been back twice since the first visit. Parking is valet and the restaurant validates your ticket to make it free. I had this burger with apple and some sort of aioli that was absolutely out of this world. Second time I visited I got this breakfast that had fried eggs and slow-roasted beef with this amazing savory sauce. It was a total gutbomb and not really the smartest thing to eat at 9am, but I enjoyed it heartily.  Duly impressed, the fiancee and I decided to host our bridal shower here, and have them cater it too. The room was stunning, and the staff was great. They had a staff member operate our buffet while our guests grabbed what they wanted amongst an assortment of soup, salads, and sandwiches. Everything was delicious and fresh, and much more impressive than similarly catered events I've paid twice much a head for (I think it was better food than our wedding, actually).  Staff is fantastic and knowledgeable, service is great, and the food is so awesome they could charge 50% more for it and I wouldn't really complain. This place is super trendy and a great way to impress a date or business client. Plus, it doesn't have the obnoxious overly fancy ambiance, lackluster generic food, and snotty staff that a lot of pricier (and totally not worth it) places in Scottsdale do."}
{"text":"I love the swanky, Ocean's 11/13 feel of this place. If only I had been noshing with Danny Ocean instead of on a business trip :)    Each of us had the chopped salad (yowza!) and split a couple of small plates including the truffled grilled cheese & the tomato and goat cheese casserole (double yowza!).    I had to grab several match books on the way home, so just in case any of my friends are at my house when I light a candle - - they will know just how swanky I roll!  LOL!"}
{"text":"Okay...I've never had grits.  Luckie Maounds ordered a side of grits.  I sampled...about half the plate.  Now...I ate Cream of Wheat a lot when I was a kid and grits are about the same.  The big difference is that this place makes it the way my mom never would...with real butter, whole milk and cheese on top.  G'damn.  It wasn't just the grits that got me all hot and bothered.  Let me break it down:  *O.J. - fresh squeezed.  No fillers here; it is the real deal.  *Blue Plate Special - on this particular day, it was a scramble with bacon (that's all I needed to hear), mushrooms, tomatoes, green onions and covered in your choice of hollandaise sauce or swiss cheese (I chose the former of the two).  It is served up with a side of potatoes and toast.  Holy hearty!!!!  It was cooked well and so delicious.  Only gripe is serving butter on the side rather than buttering the toast right away; it never melted!!  *Grits - yeah, yeah...enough about that.  *The patio - it was a gorgeous morning and I am glad we chose to sit outside.  The pool was nearby and opening up as we were there.  The landscaping at this hotel is divine; nice flowers, chic 60s decor.  It is top notch.  *OUR WAITRESS!!! - her name escapes me, which sucks because she was a GREAT server.  Asked cool questions without being overbearing, offered to take our photo, made sure we had what we needed at all times.  She was fantastic!  Next time I am here, I will hit up this place again.  I absolutely loved this little oasis in the Scottsdale desert!"}
{"text":"I wonder how many restaurants that are within hotels would make it on their own in a stand alone setting? Cafe ZuZu would do fine, trust me, they don't need the captive clientele.   Had breakfast here twice while staying at the Valley Ho. Absolutely amazing service and food. First morning I had the fresh fruit and yogurt parfait with homemade granola, delicious. Next morning had the best egg white omelete ever.   As with everything Valley Ho, this was a very relaxing and pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I loved this Happy Hour!!  It goes until 7pm every day so there is plenty of time to take advantage of the specials. They have $3 specialty drinks, wine (my fav), and select beers. There are also several appetizers on the Happy Hour menu for $3.   I went there for a friend's birthday on a Tuesday, and the bar area was very crowded when we got there with some business guests of the hotel, but once it cleared out we had a really enjoyable time at our table. The atmosphere was very comfortable and our server was really friendly and smiling which is a plus.   I'm pretty sure we tried every single appetizer on the Happy Hour menu. I kinda have a simple taste, so I really really enjoyed the Bruschetta and I had THE BEST Grilled Cheese ever!! It had apples and a fig jam which gave it a different but awesome taste like you would never imagine on a grilled cheese. The only thing to keep in mind is the appetizers are very small. I didn't mind this, but my guy friends ordered about 4 appetizers each to satisfy their hungry stomachs. The grilled cheese was very tiny and only came with 2 sandwiches, but again it was absolutely delicious so I would suggest ordering at least 2 orders of it if you want to try it.   I will definitely be back to this happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Our dinner at ZuZu was exceptional. Our waiter, Alec, was absolutely astounding. He made great recommendations and was incredibly attentive. The atmosphere was very comfortable and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"10/26/10  Terrific happy hour!  I'm almost tempted to give this first visit a 5-star review, but something's holding me back... Perhaps it was bec. I found it so dark indoors; How many times do I have to yelp it-- I like to see what I'm eating!!  When I'm dining solo and I can't take great photo souvenirs of my experiences, well, I sometimes feel \"what's the point?\"    I like this space.  Thinking back now, I wished I'd gone to the NYE bash held here.  Maybe next year...  Took Mom along w/ me, and I could tell she liked the old-style swankiness, too.  I must go back again, especially w/ such delicious fare and drinks and at such terrific prices, to boot!  We both liked our drinks-- mine was The Bramble, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-zuzu-scottsdale-2?select=zkpZJuIJqPU2bG8ahL7r1A#zkpZJuIJqPU2bG8ahL7r1A a short, yet sexy concoction made w/ Bombay gin, lemon juice, muddled and fresh blackberries!  Not overly sweet, and very potent.  I believe Mom had the Pomegranate Fizz, a tall, cool, and refreshing drink made of Smirnoff vodka, pomegranate juice, and sparkling wine.  Can you believe these were $3 each??  But wait!  Not only were the cocktails $3, but so were all of the apps we tried.  And oh, how delectable they were!  Mom's favorite app was the Spinach Artichoke Dip, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-zuzu-scottsdale-2?select=XBH8OmJtPaWmzy1Y7CLmhg#XBH8OmJtPaWmzy1Y7CLmhg which I found was too runny for my taste, but if she's happy, then I'm happy.  I was torn between the crunchy Artisan Grilled Cheese (brie, apple, fig jam) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-zuzu-scottsdale-2?select=jOMpMH4mpV6O5hfSUt1txg#jOMpMH4mpV6O5hfSUt1txg and the salty-creamy Prime Rib Dip (horseradish mayo, au jus).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-zuzu-scottsdale-2?select=k6Rq3e8zU8Xys5BJPE9NEQ#k6Rq3e8zU8Xys5BJPE9NEQ   The crunch factor I yearned for and did not get from the prime rib app, I found gratified w/ the grilled cheese.  Mmm... I think I've just decided where to go for happy hour after my massage appt. tomorrow!  LOL"}
{"text":"The food was great but the staff, although super nice, made service so. incredibly. slow. We waited almost half an hour for our drinks, and they came out one at a time, with 5-10 minutes between each drink. And this was *not* during a busy time--we were one of 6 tables in the entire restaurant. A friend who'd been here a year prior said the same thing."}
{"text":"We came for a quick drink and appetizer for happy hour. I had the blackberry gin cocktail and it was SO GOOD. The dip sandwich we got as an appetizer was phenomenal as well."}
{"text":"We sat outside for a bachelorette brunch, and the ambience was incredibly cozy, shaded, surrounded by palms and plants. Service was prompt and thorough and courteous. I asked the manager if there was any surprise they could do for the bachelorette and she was extremely kind and accommodated my request with a wonderful dessert! The Bloody Mary and mimosa bar was also full of options and made brunch more fun. Great restaurant and has such a desert oasis modern \"mad men\" retro vibe!"}
{"text":"This would probably be a five-star review if I came for happy hour, but coming here for dinner was a solid experience nonetheless.   My uncle was staying at the Valley Ho so my mom, sister, and I met him for dinner here. The place was pretty empty on an early Saturday night, but I really liked the swanky, retro atmosphere.   The menu looked pretty good all the way around, but what really stood out to me was the number of salad options and the \"small plates\" that were offered. There was about ten different salad options, and although none of them seemed completely crazy, original they all sounded delicious. One of those with a small plate (there's about 12-15 different options there) makes for a great meal.   I went with a Cesar salad (I know, boring), but it was delicious. It was a little heavy on the dressing, but the croutons were to die for . I went with the lamb sausage small plate which came with a tangy cucumber salad, which was delicious as well. With the Cesar salad this was the perfect amount of food. My uncle (who can be a pain to dine with) had the salmon, which he really liked (he was very skeptical about eating salmon in AZ). My parents come here often and my dad (who wasn't with us this time around) says the beef stroganoff is the best he's ever had, and that's pretty big coming from him.   The service here is good (although like I said the place was pretty empty during my experience) and the prices are adequate for the portions and quality of the food. When I'm back in AZ visiting the fam, I'll be back! I NEED to come here for happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"Came back to the Valley Ho last weekend and had a very nice dinner at ZuZu.  The happy hour deals are great.  Had a delicious margarita and the green chili.  Very tasty.  Then the Gala Burger for dinner.  So much food I couldn't finish it.  The cocktails were great this time around.  We'll be back next time we're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My husband and I brought my mom here when she was visiting to grab breakfast. They were a bit unorganized. The food was okay, but the service was pretty slow (constantly had to flag down someone for refills of coffee), but they were nice."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite places for brunch. We drive from Anthem just to go here on occassion. It's always hard for me to choose what to get. The cinnamon roll and fresh berries are amazing. They also have a fabulous fresh scone on Sunday with cherries and chocolate inside. My husband likes the ZuZu breakfast casserole. Definitely a place everyone should try!"}
{"text":"Delicious tender salmon with a lot of flavor ($25). It had a nice, lightly breaded crust with lemon and herb, and the sides that came with it were rich and flavorful as well (buttered rice and roasted butternut squash).  A plus for Cafe ZuZu is if you check in on Yelp, you get a free glass of wine (Choice of 3 or 4 wines, listed on the check-in screen).  While the entree was delicious, the appetizer was a different matter.  We shared the ahi tuna sliders ($10), and I was surprised to see that there was no slider aspect of this appetizer, just slices of tuna with veggies.  The tuna itself was seared on the outside, but seared for too long so that the tuna was mostly cooked.  It had a light breading on the outside, but that couldn't save it from the lack of flavor.  The marinated vegetables that came as a side were more flavorful than the tuna itself!  Our waitress was lethargic with taking orders, getting our orders, serving us, and getting our bill.  Also, she didn't tell us any of the specials of the day, I had to specifically ask what they were.  Maybe it was because we were a large party so tip was already included, but she provided a very disinterested amount of service.  The atmosphere is relaxed, with a very open feel to the floor plan.  At night, it's a bit dark and the lights give off a red hue."}
{"text":"I love Cafe ZuZu. i have been here twice now, and their salads are excellent.  We went on Mother's Day and they had a \"make your own bloody mary\" bar, which was a lot of fun. At only 5 bucks a pop, it was worth it. For those of you who don't drink alcohol, they have great iced tea and they serve it all fancy-like on a plate with a napkin and even a proper iced tea spoon. Being in a hotel, you would think that this restaurant would be both mediocre AND super-expensive. It's neither.  Also, the remodel of the Valley Ho is worth seeing. Check it out!"}
{"text":"My expectations for a hotel restaurant are always low. Let's be clear-I am the biggest pain in the butt when it comes to eating out. My husband can't stand it. So I came to Scottsdale on business and stayed at the Hotel Valley Ho. Last night, did the happy hour, bar thing and it was good! Today after a 12 hr working day, I decided to eat at the hotel. Kept it simple, which I always think execution is important for simple menu items. They just absolutely nailed it. Steak=10. Taters=10. Service??=10++  Love this place and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in town by far! I've literally had every appetizer and drink on the happy hour menu and everything is excellent.  My favorite drink is the \"bourbon smash\" but the \"hot n dirty\" is the best bang for your buck. You cant really go wrong with any of the drinks as they are all strong... its just that the \"hot n dirty\" has a little more kick to it :)  The appetizers are pretty big too considering its a happy hour menu. My favorite appetizers are the chicken drumettes with the honey bourbon sauce and the artisan grilled cheese with the brie and fig jam but the prime rib dip comes in at a close 3rd place. We loved the artisan grilled cheese so much that we began making it at home for and afternoon snack.  We ordered 5 appetizers, 7 mixed drinks, and 1 large bottle of Pellegrino and the total bill came to $46.30 (i am also going to upload the picture of the bill). The funniest part is that the water was the most expensive thing on the menu.  We left there stuffed, drunk, and had money left over in our pocket. We have been back several times and will continute to go there.  I hear they have an awesome brunch complete with bloody mary bar.  you can view the happy hour menu here:  http://www.hotelvalleyho.com/pdf/zuzuhappyhour.pdf"}
{"text":"This is place is great! The service and staff was excellent and the food was delicious. Great ambiance and everyone was so nice.   We had brunch and a trip to the bloody mary and mimosa bar. I would recommend both. Attached is a picture of our food and drinks. We are staying at the hotel all week and will definitely be coming back to Zuzu!"}
{"text":"I ate breakfast daily at Cafe ZuZu while staying at Hotel Valley Ho and loved every bit of it. The food was fresh and delicious! The weather was great so we soaked up some rays on the outside patio. The service was top notch- I was really impressed. The staff was always so welcoming! On our 3rd day there I loved being welcomed back. My friend and I tried a different dish each time and was not disappointed with any of them. If you come on the weekend, I suggest the bloody mary bar!!"}
{"text":"Saturday night ...great ViBE! Live music...and mood lighting. Perfect place for a date or a group of people. Extremely attentive wait staff and the manager is very lovely. Now for the food.... Order the BURGER!!!!!! It's a go to...huge and filling.  The best perk: free dessert if you check in on Yelp."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour. $3 full-sized martinis.  The HH food ($5) is just OK."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We went for brunch (mimosa/bloody mary bar is amazing). Great outdoor seating, live music and wonderful service. The whole hotel also had this cool retro/Mad Men vibe."}
{"text":"Really cool throw back place. I love sitting at the bar and drinking and eating. Fabulous mac and cheese, beef stroganoff, onion rings and breakfast is awesome.   Really everything is delightful. a must try if you are visiting and if you live here, go and check it out. The Valley Ho is a trade mark for Scottsdale. We love you guys !"}
{"text":"HH: Good drinks but food options were so-so Breakfast:  The food was ok, waitress was confused with our request to substitute pork with chicken..."}
{"text":"Six of us staying at the hotel had dinner on the outside patio area Wednesday night. We ordered several orders of oysters on the half shell. I didn't notice the order when it went in but this is a terrible time to order oysters. Even in the best locales, raw oysters are not good right now. These were definitely not good. My friend and I got the flat iron steaks. They both came out at room temp. Not even warm. Same with the other items on the plate. We sent them back, waited until everyone else was basically done with their meals, then received the replacements....which were barely warm! I'd prefer it sit under a heat lamp and be served mostly warm or hot rather than room temp. It's just not that tough to serve a nice, warm or hot steak. Others seemed to enjoy their meal but two strikes and added time on $32 steaks doesn't cut it when there are so many other dining options nearby."}
{"text":"Why Cafe Zuzu's brunch deserves all five stars:  The menu -  First of all, there is one, not a buffet with food made who knows when on a mass scale.  It's a pretty big brunch menu with items to satisfy kids to entry-level foodies to those annoying health couscious people.  The service - They take reservations and actually honor them!  The hostess and manager were super cool about letting us load up a booth meant for 4 with our 5 selves.  Our waiter was the best - we had one of those guys in our party that insists on waiting and waiting before ordering and usually ticks off the wait staff because he'll send them away 2 or 3 times before he's ready to order - waiter showed the patience of Job and kept up the refills too.  The food - Here's a breakfast for you:  layer of buttermilk pancake, dollop of banana pudding, another pancake, more pudding, one more pancake and pudding topped with bananas and real maple syrup on the side.  Over Easy should take some lessons from Cafe Zuzu's chef.  Just writing this is making my mouth water.  Everyone else loved their food too, though other than the eggs benedict and burger (both great), I don't know what all the others got because my attention was laser focused on the pancakes.  Oh - talking about the pancakes almost made me forget they gave us a basket of bread when we sat down.  I don't know if it's the same every day, but in it was some kind of scone-thing with cherries and chocolate chips that was outstanding.  It's in the Valley Ho hotel, so the easiest way to park is to valet, which is free for Cafe ZuZu customers.  The valets sometimes forget and try to charge, though, so be sure to remind them."}
{"text":"Food was okay - we got a handful of small plates. The shrimp and grits was very tasty but only two (albeit quite large) shrimp. The squash ravioli had undeclared goat cheese on top which flustered my girlfriend since goat cheese tastes like dirty gym sock to her. The iceberg blue cheese salad was really acidic and not good. The space is great however and I would give it another try."}
{"text":"ZuZu is one of my favorite places to go for a cocktail with friends late in the evening after dinner. Spacious with a large variety of seating options, Cafe ZuZu is a fantastic throw-back reminiscent of the 1960's with an attached retro motel to boot! While I admit I have never eaten their food here, they have a fair selection of delicious cocktails and other assorted adult beverages that warrant multiple visits so you can try them all. Do yourself a favor gentlemen and toss on a skinny tie and a slim suit and enjoy drinking in the type of establishment one might imagine John and Jackie Kennedy would go to if they were still with us!   Keep singing,  -Jerron"}
{"text":"A friend of mine was having a birthday party at the Valley Ho last weekend and we decided to come here for breakfast before a day of debauchery at the pool. I ordered the California Eggs Benedict (can't remember if that's what it was actually called, but there's only two on the menu and it wasn't the traditional one). HOLY MOLY that ish was delish. Legit might be one of the best benny's I've ever had. I asked the server if they had wheat English Muffins and she said no, just homemade. \"Just Homemade\" - best English muffins hands down. I don't even wanna think how it contributed to my own muffin...muffin top that is.   Anyhoo, we came back here again the next day for breakfast. I didn't wanna be the freak that orders the same thing twice so I ordered the special...breakfast veggie quesadilla. It was good. For sure good. But it wasn't the benny. However, this time around I decided to go with Bloody Mary Bar. GREAT choice. Fantastic choice. It was only $5 and they have a great selection of items to build your own bloody and I'm not gonna lie, I made a damn fine drink.   I love me some good breakfast joints and this might be up there as one of my new favs. I think I'll just be the freak that always orders the same thing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. And that Benny ain't broke."}
{"text":"I didn't need Mad Men to tell me the 60's were cool since I always knew it. It is in my bones.   You know who else knew the 60's were and always will be awesome? The folks at Zuzu, located in the Hotel Valley Ho.  The cool factor in here is off the charts.  You would think that they would just sit back and watch the money come in from hosting locals and out of towners in a neato place, but no.  Their cocktails are equally created with the same amount of care and detail.  The moscow mule was perfect.  I didn't get a chance to sample any food, but the service in the bar was just dandy.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Eggs, tomatoes, gruyere, lettuce, all on toasted sourdough with accompanying roasted potatoes sounds and looks like the perfect post-party breakfast cure, but on the morning I dined at ZuZu, my eyes were apparently much more ambitious than my stomach.   After not eating ONE bite of my plate, the manager came out to make sure everything was alright. Of course it was, I'm just the idiot that ordered the delicious food and couldn't bring myself to eat it. She offered for me to pick something else out, but at the point, nothing was going to happen for me. Although it might seem weird to review a place where one didn't actually manage to eat anything, I thought the service and the fact that they reached out to make sure everything was okay was worth mentioning.   I did manage to nibble on those potatoes and, man, I'd be tempted to order just a plate of those next time They were greasy enough, and hearty bites full of carbs. I have to take this time to say, our server was very yelly, and I wasn't the only person to notice. It was pretty disturbing to overhear everything each table was ordering, but I know she was just trying to be clear. It was in all honesty, startling every time she opened her mouth. Just plain loud. Despite that, she was really helpful in rearranging some tables and our accommodating our group as it grew throughout the morning.   Can't wait to come back on an empty stomach and indulge here!"}
{"text":"This is the second time this week. Our server today was Sharon. If you ever eat breakfast, ask for a Sharon table. The service is truly 5 star. Everything was served hot. This time we even got the sugar sticks with the cappuccino. The frittata was delicious. The arugula was crispy and the veggies on top were hot. The potatoes were crispy and peppered. The fruit plat was cold for a long time. Keep it up. See you next year."}
{"text":"02.06.10  We quickly Yelped a place after a failed attempt at Cafe Monarch (must be hard running everything with just one person).  Located in the lobby floor of the Valley Ho hotel, this reminds me (down to the logo on the matchbox) of Anzu in SF.  I had the winter linguine [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RTegy5CUBpMK65pr8UeDgA?select=N0o3_Q6n2yQ8MpaGNUMGWQ].  Comes with butternut squash, mushrooms, swiss chard, marsala wine, crispy sage and parmigiano reggiano.  They use fresh ingredients and the dish was very tasty.  Portion enough for 1.5 meals.  The others had the ahi slider [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RTegy5CUBpMK65pr8UeDgA?select=F1wOsuKHFba52sF31O4DZQ], chicken quesadilla [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RTegy5CUBpMK65pr8UeDgA?select=ScqXMRoXvZtrO7yF45MSNA] and truffled grilled cheese [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RTegy5CUBpMK65pr8UeDgA?select=DUH8R9fVcJgNByTdLAZ7IA].  All the dishes were delicious and a delight to look at.  Wonderful job on the plating.  The restroom has a couch where you can lounge while you wait for the rest of the girls to finish changing and putting on their make up."}
{"text":"My bf and I decided to come here for Sunday brunch. It was absolutely delicious. He ordered the stuffed French toast with a side of spicy turkey sausage and I ordered the red velvet waffle with berries. All dishes were amazing. Before delivery of our meal they served us fresh chocolate/cherry scones. The scones were perfect. Our waitress was pleasant and tentative to our needs. We recommend Sunday brunch here."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised after choosing to eat here solely because we were exhausted after a 7 hour drive.  The brussel sprouts au gratin were phenomenal and the grilled pork chop was done perfectly.  The service is efficient and not obtrusive.  Not sure what the normal crowd here is since we only spent a night in Scottsdale, but seemed like it was a popular destination for girls trying to replicate their own versions of a southwest SATC night out. Definitely recommend going here if you ever find yourself in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is inside the Valley Ho. Good brunch/lunch spot. They had a $5 dollar Bloody Mary bar- WHAT WHAT, amazzzinggg. Nice to sit outside on a nice 75 degree day and eat some good food."}
{"text":"Went for thanksgiving because we're tired of cooking!  Great food and service. Thank you Pete for making us feel so welcome."}
{"text":"Hotel breakfast is one of my favorite reasons for traveling, and Cafe ZuZu didn't disappoint!   On a recent trip to Scottsdale for work, a colleague of mine and I had some morning eats at the restaurant inside Hotel Valley Ho. In all of the times that I've stayed at HVH, I've never had breakfast, and boy was I missing out till this month.   I had the veggie omelet with potatoes and an English muffin, typical for me! The omelet was HUGE...HUUUUUUGE. I would definitely suggest downsizing on the number of eggs, especially if you plan to go to town on the seasoned potatoes which were delicious. The muffin didn't have me jumping up and down yelling \"zuzuzuzu\" or anything, but I was so full after getting through the potatoes and half the omelet that it didn't matter that the muffin sort of got lost in the mix.   Although I couldn't get through the crazy amount of food, I asked the waitress for an A+ for effort. She did better than that and gave me two gold stars!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for brunch at this place which is very reminiscent of Saguro in Palm Springs...started with their make your own mimosa bar which comes with strawberry, OJ or peach juice!! Strawberry was pretty good actually!! Their latte was really good and foamy as well!! Then had their California Benedict which the poached egg was overlooked but overall flavor was good, their stuffed french toast was sweet and amazing!! No syrup needed!! We ended with what my wife called \"top 5 desert we have ever had in the valley\" with the Milk and Honey!!"}
{"text":"As if the Valley Ho wasn't great enough, they had to go ahead and slap on one of the best restaurants I've ever seen attached to a hotel. ZuZu made my stay even better, and I found myself sitting in the colorful, swanky lounge quite a few times.   Service is so friendly and fast, and the server we had both mornings I had breakfast there could not have been better. Coffee comes out right away and is strong and flavorful, and they have a ton of other drink options. You can get a latte or espresso, and they even have a drink made by blending OJ with ice cream. I was trying to be \"good\" on this trip or I would have indulged in that last one...  My favorite menu item for breakfast is the garden veggie omelet, complete with oven roasted tomatoes, squash, basil, and goat cheese. I added spinach, and subbed tomatoes and avocado for the potatoes (although those damn potatoes are amazing.) The second time I had breakfast over there, I tried the eggs benedict, which was some of the best I've ever had.   I also had some menu items sent to my room a couple of times, and can't rave about them enough. The beet salad gets five stars, the guacamole gets five stars, and so does the cheese plate... which officially earned the title of 'best cheese plate of all time.' If you don't believe me, take a look at my photos.  Fantastic drink list, fun atmosphere, GREAT food, and wonderful service. ZuZu made leaving the Valley Ho more painful than it already was!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended. It was good, but not great. The atmosphere and being at the hotel was the best part and cafe zuzu is just part of that experience. The food, traditional American with a flair, was good, but not as good as it could of been for the price. If I was to pay that much for dinner again I would go to Durant's. But, it is worth checking out. I have heard wonderful things about the mac n' cheese, burgers and other items. And this was my one and only experience there while staying at the hotel. I think that it is worth checking out, the atmosphere is wonderful and the setting is even better. Give it a try and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Valley Ho is great for visitors, even if you're not staying at the hotel itself. Zuzu still offers food and drinks in the beautiful mid century lobby.  My parents were loving the 1960's vibe as soon as we walked in the front door. Plus my dad was even more excited to see golf on tv at the bar.  We shared some apps and light fare, including hummus and the little gem salad. That and a few rounds of drinks.   It's not cheap but it is unique. Sometimes there's a premium for nostalgia. And there's a Yelp check in offer for a free dessert!"}
{"text":"I am so impressed with the management team at ZuZu. They went above and beyond to make sure my experience was a pleasant one. I sincerely look forward to dining with ZuZu again soon."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for Valentine's Day yesterday.  Service was great, the bar/restaurant area was modestly decorated for V-day. It was simple, but cute. My boyfriend and I opted for the 4 course meal they offered for this occasion.  He ordered Glenlivet neat and I had a glass of cabernet. Drinks were not included with the 4 course meal.   The first course was pretty good. We chose the Charcuterie + Antipasti. The chicken liver with PB&J was interesting. For the final 3 courses, we got one of each item so we could try/share (there were only 2 options per course).   Soup and salad in course 2 were fine. Nothing spectacular. Desserts in the final course were delicious - can't go wrong with something chocolatey & crème brûlée.  The third course... sigh. The bacon wrapped filet was YUMMY. The baked lobster carbonara...MEH. This entree was so bland and underwhelming. Just no flavor whatsoever. Not sure I even spied any lobster in it, but I took a few bites & was stuffed. The sauce was pretty heavy. I didn't even have the room in me to have a 2nd piece of the filet my BF offered .  Anyway, I guess for $65 per person it wasn't bad, but I've definitely had better. We may return to ZuZu to try some items from their regular menu. Oh, there was some live music near the bar as we were heading out and they were great!"}
{"text":"The food at ZuZu is consistently high quality and fantastic.  I had not stayed at the Valley Ho for a few years and last time i was there i dined at Trader Vics which is gone now...  But wow as i impressed  - the food is tremendous.  From simple food by the pool to breakfast, lunch or dinner. All great,  I have been telling my friends that live in Scottsdale to make a special trip over to enjoy a great meal - not what you would expect at a hotel ..  Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"I've gone to ZuZu with a friend the past 3 Wednesday's and service has definitely been lack luster. We were at Valley Ho for their 6:30pm poolside yoga class, which with a monetary donation includes a drink ticket. We always grab seats at the bar after, but it's almost as if we're peasants. Lol. Definitely get a feeling of being ignored. The last time we went we joked around about how long it would take this time to A. be greeted and B. actually get a drink. There are always plenty of staff, bartenders, whoever, running around so I don't quite understand. Is it the yoga pants or what?  I've been here a couple of times before and enjoyed it. I like that they offer lotion and hand towels in the bathroom, the ambiance is very nice and sitting outside by the fire is lovely at night, but lately they haven't been on point! Tsk tsk."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. It seemed like it would be a great place to end a bacheorette party in Scottsdale.  Service was great and we were seated right away.  Our server was nice and super friendly.  Pricing was reasonable.   The orange blossom smoothie was delicious, it was like an orange creamsicle smoothie.  The chicken soup was very bland AND the fritatta was more like an omelet. The food taste was not that great.    e got a free dessert with the Yelp check in, that was nice. The grounds are beautiful."}
{"text":"Holy effin' eff! Best happy hour anywhere in the valley!   Challenge: If you can find a better happy hour than the three dollar bonanza at Cafe Zuzu, I will eat one of the wretched pickled eggs from Palo Verde Lounge, the gray-green eggs that time forgot.  I'll start with the tapas-style appetizers because they really blew me away. Two fall-of-the-bone tender braised pork shanks that will melt in your mouth and fill your belly? Three bucks. A surprisingly ample mini prime rib dip with (unassuming) horseradish mayo and au jus? Three bucks. Two buttery, rich grilled brie and thin sliced green apple sandwiches with fig jam reduction? Three bucks. I'm salivating right now.   The other two options included the border chili, which had fresh chunks of meat but was a bit bland compared to the rest of the apps, and the bruschetta that was utterly forgettable. Standard tomatoes, olives and capers, nowhere near as memorable as Il Postino or La Bocca's stellar examples.   Since these apps are a bit on the small side, the best bang for your buck to sate your hunger would be the mini pork shanks, followed closely by the prime rib dip. The artisan grilled cheese was my personal favorite (sooo perfectly buttery, sweet and savory!), but it really would have benefited from another little grilled brie sammich on the plate because they're quite small.   Several of our party tried the wine (chard, pinot, merlot, and I think they've even got some bubbly) and had positive things to say. While we all had zero interest in trying the beer, since it was just PBR on draft or domestic swill in bottles. There were much better options to be had for three bucks, like the specialty cocktails!   The waitress that took care of us was kind enough to explain what each of the cocktails entailed. Best liquor bang for your buck? The Hot 'N' Dirty, an extra dirty vodka martini with a splash of Tabasco and three olives. They even bring it out in a little cocktail shaker to pour tableside, ensuring that not a drop of goodness is wasted on the way to your table. Second most potent potable was the Bourbon Smash, a whiskey cocktail that's the illegitimate love child of a mojito and a mint julep. In the words of Sammy J, \"It'll getcha drunk!\"   The Gin Fizz was one of the most refreshing cocktails, kind of a gin and tonic with more prominent citrus notes and a splash of simple syrup. And for the girlie girls in attendance, the Bramble, Basil Showbiz and Cherry Limeade will treat ya right! The Bramble was heavy on the blackberry, the Basil Showbiz strawberried out and the Cherry Limeade had me second guessing whether someone had spiked a Sonic limeade. Superb, one and all. I haven't a single bad word to say about any the cocktails taste-wise, although the more frou frou drinks seemed a bit light on the pour.   Three dollar beer, wine, specialty cocktails and appetizers? A frenzy of (relatively sophisticated) gluttony? A mere 15 bucks. Cafe Zuzu is my new go-to for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Excellent food in a mid century hotel that has been renovated back to its 1950s roots. Ask for the casual bar menu in addition to the dinner menu for lesser priced options. Blue cheese dressing is out of sight. Great place for outdoor dining while looking at the lit palms."}
{"text":"Amazing. Green pork chili with eggs (perfectly cooked) was out of this world - deep in flavors but not too spicy. Loved it. This kitchen can cook an egg, scrambled, over easy, poached - all perfect. Frittata was excellent. The walnut/cranberry toast and the homemade English muffins were delicious. I dream about the walnut/cranberry bread. So was the homemade jam - WOW.  Beef stroganoff is good - a little al dente but the meat is so tender and the sauce is top notch. Same for the filet mignon. Excellently prepared. Just wonderful. Mr Muscle had the braised beef short rib served on vegetables and mashed potatoes. Claims it was one of the best meals he has ever had. We also tried the special one night, a mac and cheese (with poblanos chilis, corn, fresh tomatoes.. yum!). Its ALL SO GOOD.  Pass on the pancakes, not so wonderful, trust me on this one. Austin, Chelsea, Anna, TJ - everyone working at the bar and the restaurant are a jewel in the crown here. Eat in this hotel's restaurant - you will not regret it."}
{"text":"ZuZu not bad , not bad at all... I'm glad your out there in the desert doing your modern retro thing. I've been to the Standard on both coast and your doing it better..."}
{"text":"Wow. This was one of my favorite places to eat ever! I made a group reservation on Open Table a few weeks before the actual dining out during AZ Restaurant Week and by the day of, it had dwindled to 4. They weren't offended or upset and were quite nice to accommodate our smaller group.   Since I'd never been before, I was unaware that they have free valet, so I parked on the city streets. Not a bad little walk, but next time I know better. The lobby opens into the ZuZu bar area, but the actual hostess stand is tucked a bit back there [maybe it should be moved up closer?]. A manager and a hostess greeted me both quite warmly and directed myself and one of the girls to a table. Zach was our server and was amazing from the beginning. He gave us his personal favorites on the menu, both drinks and food wise. Made us all laugh at how much he loves peanut butter and their PB dessert on the AZRW menu!  The ambiance is totally trendy, but with an ode to the 1960s/70s. Around 7/8p on the weekends, you'll find some good background music. Totally adds to the environment. This would be a great date night selection.  I started with the New Fashioned cocktail. I typically prefer vodka or gin-based cocktails but this one rocked my socks. Both Zach and the house manager PJ recommended it. On that subject...can I just say how nice PJ was?! He came by our table a few times throughout the night to check in on us.   One of the girls ordered the Mac n cheese as an appetizer as an addition to our AZRW sides. I'd never had mussels before and absolutely LOVED them. If it wasn't looked down upon, I probably would've drank the broth straight from the bowl. A little disappointed at how small my main course filet was because I wanted more! It was delicious. Out of our group I was the only one to get the Panama Cotta for Desert. Might've been the best course! So rich and sinfully good.  I can totally see myself coming back but maybe actually stay the night at the resort too."}
{"text":"Located in Hotel Valley Ho, this is a fun place to have breakfast or brunch.  They have seating inside or out on their patio near the pool.  The hotel has a retro-the Jetsons sort of vibe to it.  There are lots of healthy choices on the menu.  I ordered their egg white omelet with spinach and broccoli and it was pretty good.  The cinnamon bun is huge and great for sharing."}
{"text":"The wife and I needed a vacation and we heard Hotel Valley Ho was awesome.  It is awesome.  We wanted breakfast and decided to check out ZUZUs and we loved the experience and the food.  They had a fun 50s feel with a modern flair.  We both had the Denver omelette and it was VERY tasty of a normal omelette. The people were awesome. Go check it out."}
{"text":"Excellent service, everyone's food (party of six) came out within a reasonable time of each other. Great bright and boisterous vibe. Hip place for breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"This hotel restaurant is a terrific example of how Yelp can synthesize with an invested business and promote a great experience. ZuZu is a gem. Fantastic retro style, unique culinary approach, fresh food, good service and a relaxed, casual atmosphere for evening dining. It's clear from other reviews that management is invested in keeping it that way, something I love to see. It's important to know that people are listening to the customer base.  I checked in on a Friday night and received a complementary glass of Pinot Noir that paired nicely with one of the specials, fish and chips. Five battered nuggets of white fish nestled themselves next to an inspired take on tartar sauce: fresh cabbage and light cream sauce, nothing thick or mayo-ish. Fries came separately in a lined basket accompanied by a delicious red chile dipping sauce and good old ketchup. Nothing too greasy, which is usually the issue with this dish, I loved it.  I'll be back in October, and I'm looking forward to the much lauded breakfast. Great to know that the fantastic accommodations of the hotel are backed up by a seriously unique and enjoyable dining establishment. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. Try the ZuZu burger, better than most, the chefs have excellent attention to detail. Ambiance is a splash of the Jetsons mixed with the Brady Bunch on vacation. Bar looked nice, sexy, tattoo'd clientele, beer selection was average but the menu cocktails were 100% originals. Recommended."}
{"text":"Located right in our hotel and they have a cute outdoor patio with a fire pit off the bar area.  $3 happy hour specials, yummy food and drinks!  It was a great spot to start or end a night out with a few cocktails outside."}
{"text":"Cafe ZuZu is now, quit possibly, the best burger spot in Phoenix.  Cafe ZuZu's has always been one of our go-to spots in Scottsdale. The innovative menu, decent prices, and mid-century modern decor has made it a favorite with our friends and extended family for years.  They have always had a solid burger selection, although we usually went for something else as there's no shortage of enticing items on the menu. (The truffled grilled cheese was memorable.)  But in the last few years, ZuZu has really upped their burger game. The cafe has entered, and won, an annual burger cook-off, with the winning entry ending up on the menu for a year. The latest winner, the Merlot Melt, is a masterpiece and I've ordered it every time I've eaten at ZuZu's since I saw it on the menu in March.  I was recently preparing my mouth for another Merlot Melt when -- Bam! -- the waitress hands us all a burger menu. A Burger Menu!!! Cafe ZuZu now has a second menu devoted entirely to burgers, and what burgers they are.  After much deliberation, I started with the Hangover, and it was AMAZING. A juicy hamburger patty, sharp cheddar cheese, jalapeño, onion rings, and a fried egg. I kid you not, it was stunning.  Now I have to go back to try the other five or six new burgers. I can't wait to experience the Bayou Burger, the PB + J Burger, and the Smoke Stack Burger.  For those who might object to paying $16 for a burger, I have three words: Worth. Every. Penny.  The price is made a little easier because the burger-menu burgers all include Cafe ZuZu's famous twice-fried fries (which are extra on the regular menu). I also recommend taking advantage of the Burger & Beer option, which gets you a draft craft beer for $4.   Update: We went again last Sunday, only to discover that the burger menu is M-F only. So you'll have to clear some time during the week. #burgercraving"}
{"text":"My fiance and I are both VERY new to town (like 1 week new) and we both have an eye for mid century modern design and architecture. I had read some great reviews about the place..so without hesitation, I made us a reservation for Friday night at 7.   We came early and got a drink in the lounge. I love that their happy hour goes to 7, I feel you don't find that at a lot of places. I was surprised at the fact that it wasn't super busy. Friday night.. swanky spot in Scottsdale.. surely there'd more people but perhaps we're onto something by going to a hotel restaurant that I'm sure a lot of the locals forget is there.  We were taken care of and the food was out of this world. I ordered the Salmon and it was amazing..so smokey! Not to mention, the ambience is PERFECT. I felt like I was on an episode of Mad Men. It really takes you back to another era. So cool!  We will definitely be back. My fiance and I both agreed we'd love to take family and friends here when they come to visit!"}
{"text":"I had Christmas dinner here. The waiter was excellent. The room was beautiful and decorated with style for Christmas. The entire staff was in great Chett. I order the crab bisque and the prime rib. Both were sensational and went well with the champaign. For dessert, the chocolate Torte was excellent."}
{"text":"Took two others to Zu Zu for lunch yesterday (Saturday) at noon. Ask for a booth and were about to be seated when I noticed that of all the booths available, hostess was about to seat us beside a four top with a crying infant and two year old.  Requested a different booth and she accommodated, and we were given a \"brunch menu\". Waited a while to be noticed, but eventually we we served water. Again waited for someone to notice we wanted to order.mFood came out, but we had to request utensils. Fruit side looked excellent, turkey sandwich okay, but accompanying chips were stale and Eggs Benedict served on tough pastry of some sort which I could not cut with my knife.  Side of cheesy grits was inedible.  Requested and received small oven baked potatoes instead. No one offered the complimentary chocolate scones mentioned in other recent reviews. If I had known, I would have asked for them because we certainty paid for them. All in all, a disappointment, because we are considering purchase of an expensive condo across the street and really wanted to like this place.  Have been searching for the happy hour menu without luck. A fond memory of staying at the Valley Ho. Upon arriving Phoenix three decades ago.  The place still has an excellent, fun vibe."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something retro, and want to feel like you just stepped into a scene from Mad Men, this cute lounge is for you. Unique drink selection, and a great patio for hanging with friends."}
{"text":"I love the decor and uniqueness of this mid century vintage hotel. It's like walking back to the late 50's. Be sure to check out the great pictures above the lobby on the second floor. I also enjoyed the gym, big bathtub in room, and the over funky fun color scheme! Be sure to check this place out."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed coming here for years. Recently, with the arrival of a new cook, the food has taken a turn for the worst. The quality has suffered in an obvious attempt to cut costs. The service however has gotten better. We will not be returning"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing, the staff is so friendly and amazing. The sangria is made to order, you can order is less or more sweet. One of the best Happy Hour I've been too."}
{"text":"Cafe Zu Zu...I love Yu Yu! Those were some serious BBQ Burgers I took back to room 6106. Lathered in a perfectly sweet, tangy and mildly peppered sauce with thick slabs of bacon and Vermont cheddar, or was it Wisconsin...not sure...but it was sharp and we all know cheddah makes it bettah! While the mayem and madness of putting together a fashion show unraveled in our room, I sought refuge on our private patio with my new friend (the burger) and it's sidekick (homemade chips!)....I devoured and enjoyed each morsel. The bread was soft and crispy on the edges! Heavenly I say. The signage for Zu Zu is a little Weird Weird...I thought it was Trader Vic's as I saw two signs for TV and none for ZZ! Didn't care, the decor was warm and modern with big puffy cotton ball lighting dotting the ceiling. Hostess and bartender were warm and modern with big puffy cotton balls...oh, wait...I digress...edit...the manager put together my order with a minor mislabeling of medium well and medium rare. Sorry Rickie...I know you don't like the pink spot. Hey. Clean it up yelpitas. I liked the menu I perused while waiting for my chow, enjoyed the decor and service...Cafe Zu Zu easily gets two, two thumbs up I say...Up Up!"}
{"text":"We are locals that used to eat here often for breakfast. Quality of food started to go down and more often orders were not correct. Took off out list of places to go for breakfast on the weekends."}
{"text":"The Food, I had the hamburger and the husband had meatloaf.  I thought the burger was decent and my husband said his meatloaf tasted like mom's meatloaf dipped in butter, then deep fried, and drenched with gravy. Comfort food not at it's best  The atmosphere, Uhmm..  let's see how can I best describe the atmosphere?  Take a trip back the late 60's and let's take Miami, San Diego, Cabo, and put it in a martini shaker and pour it right smack  in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale and you get Hotel Valley Ho.  Definitely a party scene.  Service-  The waiter did not seem to have any real opinions about the food, just that it was all wonderful.  In summary I would return for drinks, and fun, not the food."}
{"text":"Great place for the unique requirements we had last night. We needed wifi and wanted some wine. So we stopped in (before the Yelp Rocks event in Scottsdale) and found just that. Sat down in the lobby bar and fired up the Mac. We were thrilled to find favorites on the wine list and more excited when the cheese plate we ordered arrived at our table. Great cheeses with fresh breads, fruits and a sweet spread that topped it off. Our favorite cheese plate in town right now."}
{"text":"I have frequented ZuZu a lot over the past couple of years, but my experience last night was very disappointing.    I tend to meet there with a group of ladies (5 or 6 ladies minimum up to 10 or so) on a semi-regular basis.  Last month, when I made reservations, I was told I didn't need them if we were eating/drinking from the Happy Hour menu.    We typically order off of the Happy Hour menu, and I've never had a situation where this has been an issue.  Last night, when I arrived, I asked for a table for 6 and was told if we were eating off of the Happy Hour menu, we could sit in the lounge chairs by the bar or the cocktail tables outside.  It's 100+ degrees these days; so, we pushed some tables together and made do with the lounge area though the regular seating area was dead.  This was irritating but nothing to complain about or to bring attention to.  Our server, however, was rude.  We ordered fries, which she forgot to bring with our meal and we had to follow up about.  They were SO SALTY that I wish we didn't order them.  Another lady ordered a coke, which didn't arrive and she had to ask for again.  There was no apology for the mishap with the Coke.    We had 6 people, but one of the ladies in our group had her drinks paid for by her husband who was at a different table.  Technically, this left us with 5 ladies/5 tabs, which she gave us an attitude about when we asked if we could split our tabs.  She did (begrudgingly) split our tickets, but the tickets had an error on them and had to be corrected.  We were charged for a Chardonnay instead of the Coke.  The gratuity was charged twice on another ticket.  It was avoidable mistakes, which should have been caught.  Overall, the level of mistakes and the attitude from our server left a sour taste in my mouth.  I usually really enjoy my experience here but will remember this next time I am looking for a night out with some girls."}
{"text":"The Beautiful Carin and I stayed at the Valley Ho to celebrate my birthday this week! I turned 40 for the first time (after many years of celebrating my 39th birthday, it's time to move on and \"grow up\":) Café ZuZu is the in house restaurant at Valley Ho and a genuine bright spot in an already terrific hotel experience.  ZuZu is named after the little girl in \"It's A Wonderful Life\", the movie that's on TV 2-3 dozen times each Christmas.  What that has to do with the restaurant is unclear, but they had to name it something, and ZuZu works for me:) I think we all know that hotel restaurants can be an \"uneven\" experience, but that's not the case with little ZuZu:) We have eaten at ZuZu's before, over the years and always found the food and service to be very good and very reasonably priced (esp. for a hotel restaurant, where the prices and service often reflect the fact that they think you are captive to their $15 tuna sandwiches and their $20 omelets). ZuZu's is reasonably priced and they serve a great meal! This visit, I had a BLT with an over easy egg on it...I didn't really think you could improve on a decent BLT...I stand corrected! This sandwich has a touch of genius! I also tried their truffled grilled cheese and club sandwiches...wonderfully made...fresh tasting ingredients and great bread, well prepared eaten poolside with a couple of martini's...now that's what I call a hearty breakfast:) Fresh cut fries and fresh house made potato chips are a great accompaniment to the meals. The menus are creative and I have yet to have an unhappy experience at ZuZu. Whether you sit inside at ZuZu and listen to Frank, Tony and rest crooning along like it's 1960 again, or have your lunch at the pool and listen to Pearl Jam, Priest and the Boss, ZuZu is a good time:)"}
{"text":"ZuZu is the utterly fabulous hotel bar/restaurant in my favorite hotel of all time, so how can I not grant them 5 stars?   Expect more of that Mid Century vibe you encounter in the glorious hotel lobby continuing through ZuZu's chill lounge and restaurant's interior. The dining room is large and sports some comfy round booths, which I love, and the patio is the perfect place to enjoy your meal alfresco. I've spent time in the lounge, too (of course I did), which is very swank 60s jetsetting into the future. I like. I very much like. Heck, the Hotel Valley Ho is the stuff of architectural and design genius in its entirety. I wouldn't expect anything less of ZuZu  Although on the whole, the staff ranges from decent (yet maybe not the most on the ball when it comes to remembering that you've asked for something) to totally on it, I have to give special props to Sharon, who's the best breakfast waitress, like, ever! You could swear that she's purposely conjuring up the no-nonsense but loving vibe you'd expect from Madge at the diner back in the day, but no, there's nothing contrived about her. She's an absolute asset to this restaurant and stands out as someone you'll be recommending that people request when they are planning to visit.  Onto the food: I hate eggs and rarely if ever eat them, but I'll be damned if I didn't order that garden veggie omelet three times (egg whites only) on my past two stays. It's super fluffy and stuffed with seasonal veggies and goat cheese. Perfection! Side of grits, yes, please!!!  A special note: What happened to that spectacular cheese plate?! No, seriously, I was looking forward to returning just for that and now it's apparently no longer on the menu. Sadness! Read Aimee K's review for the deets on this plate. We were both incredibly disappointed to learn of the menu update. I'm not even going to tell you about how amazing it was because I don't want you to get your hopes up. But for the love of god, please, pretty please, ZuZu put it back on the menu!  I don't know if they do the same Happy Hour in the fall (I didn't see mention of it?) as they did in the middle of the summer but I felt it was outstanding. Cheap glasses of wine and specially-priced apps (including, *sob* a smaller version of the aforementioned cheese plate).   Roooooom service!!!! As in 24-hours! Another perk of staying at the Ho. It's prompt, and friendly and well, you can't argue with a good guac. It's the side of sauteed spinach, however, that still has my mouth watering. And memories of that cheese plate enjoyed back in July.  Sigh. I really need to get over it."}
{"text":"6 years later and the beef short ribs are still amazing! Now, time for some chocolate cream pie!"}
{"text":"I met my parents here on my birthday for their happy hour! It was a great choice because we had a great time and enjoyed some delish eats. Our server was nice and tried to get us everything as quickly as possible. It was busy so she had to bust her butt working the floor, kudos to her. The retro decor is a lot of fun and makes for a difference experience.   So we almost ordered everything off the happy hour menu, you really can't go wrong with what you order, it was all great. Actually the only thing we did NOT get was the Asian Glazed Chicken Wings. Everything else was easy to share and nothing was left on any of our plates!  As for drinks, I went with my favorite drink which I was happy to see on their menu, the Bramble. It was strong but not so strong that it was hard to drink. My dad had the Haboob which was equally as strong.   Great drinks, great food, great service."}
{"text":"ZuZu was awesome. A good friend took me here for my birthday. Our server was Sharon and she was great. She was attentive, polite and answered our questions professionally. She was on her game as I suspect most if not all of the servers here are. The staff seemed very polished, nice. There are a couple things that actually pushed this review over a 5 Star. And I don't throw 5 Stars around like a lot of Yelpers. First, the butter that is served with the bread was cool but not frozen, so it was easy to spread on the delish rolls that come before the meal. Second, I ordered an Iced Tea and it came with a small container of simple syrup. Yep, sugar water. Why oh why can't every place do this. Awesome. This is probably the single most impressive concept I've run into in awhile. Most, if not all sweeteners do not dissolve in cold liquid. Anyone who uses the pink, blue, yellow, white, brown or green packaged sweetener can attest to this. The only reason I use the one I do is because it's the one that dissolves the best in my iced tea. Ahhhh, but not here. The simple syrup was awesome and my tea tasted great. On to the food. I had the Hangover Burger. This burger comes with crispy jalapeño, cheddar cheese, onion strings, topped with chorizo and a fried over-easy egg. They schmear a smoked chile aioli on the soft bun. I ordered mine medium rare and it was pretty close to that. The only negative would be that the crispy jalapeño's were not crispy at all, barely even toasted really but that didn't effect the taste one bit. The bun was soft, the chorizo was properly cooked, the egg was spot on and the onion strings were not greasy and fried perfectly. Winner winner Hangover burger dinner.  My friend had The Famous ZUZU Burger. He ordered his rare and unfortunately it came out a bit more medium rare. It was close and I'm sure the cook was just nervous about sending out a rare burger. Regardless, he ate it and said it was a good burger. The famous ZUZU has smoked bacon, balsamic onions and blue cheese crumbles on it. We both got the house made potato chips which were awesome. Sharon brought us some catsup and ranch dressing for dipping.  All in all, a very nice experience. This will be my new place in central Scottsdale to grab lunch.  Great Service. Great Food. Great Experience. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"My family loves this place. They have stayed here and eaten here just a couple of times, and have always had a great experience with the staff, service and food. Today was my first time here and as I love the feel and the decor the staff and service was pitiful. We called 2 days ago for a Sunday brunch reservation. We got here a little early and we're sat right away. It being Sunday things were crazy, people everywhere, and tables are placed so close to one another to fit as many as possible. And for me that's fine, not a problem. We were sat outside right next to a indoor window, thankfully there were umbrellas on the patio to shade everyone, except us. As time went by the sun started to hit us. We asked for an umbrella and about 20 minutes later nothing. A member of our group had to get up to look for the manager who came and tried to move an umbrella for us, taking shade away from other people. Eventually we asked to move to another table which we got a reply of those are for people who reserved with us. Uhhh that's us! We move hearing snide comments from the people around us. Okay cool we finally have shade. High of 96 today btw. When we first were seated (in our first seats) about 6 of us order the Bloody Mary/mimosa bar. Sooo we get to our new table and our food comes out about 10 minutes before we even get our drinks, which we have to get up and leave our food to prepare. One things for sure the food is fresh and prepared well. Loved my veggie omelet with goat cheese and oven roasted tomatoes, would recommend it to any one it fancies. Our server seemed to care very little about how we were treated and that we were happy, Something I would think an establishment in Scottsdale would be noted on. As a results our drinks were comped and we ended our meal on a high note. (Left out a couple more instances but the were small, compared) come at your own risk and enjoy the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"During our stay cation at the hotel valley ho, my boyfriend and I had the pleasure of getting to dine at cafe zuzu. We didn't have the best of experiences within the hotel itself but our two meals here were definitely good experiences. I would actually return to this cafe, even though I would probably not stay at the valley ho again. For my dinner I got the crispy Thai salad and my bf got the zuzu burger. Both were prepared well, with care and attentiveness. The ingredients were fresh and zesty and everything was plated nicely. Our server was a bit annoying at first and then he disappeared until it was time to deliver the food and pick up the check. He reeked of cigarettes, but aside from the server, our meal and experience was wonderful. We even ate a small bite for breakfast the next morning and again, everything was delicious and fresh. I love that I live less than a mile away from this place, so I'm sure I will return. But I will ask for a different server, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Cafe Zu Zu has been a decent place for larger groups.  Most times the service has been spot on but the last time I was there (2 weeks ago) the service was slow.  We were sitting outside and the inside looked pretty dead.  I think our server was about to leave until we came rolling in and then she had to stay.  At least that was the vibe I got.  The food was good though.  I has the cheeseburger, it was really good.  We had the cheese plate for an appetizer and it was just so-so.  Others indulged in mash potatoes, macaroni and cheese and some salads.  They all seemed content with their food.  I really enjoy the bar in Hotel Valley Ho.  Very chill and cool."}
{"text":"I typically avoid eating at the hotel I'm staying at, but after pulling up Yelp and seeing the reviews for ZuZu I decided to give it a shot. I was not disappointed.   Casual open environment with large windows letting in the Arizona sun. There is outdoor seating as well but it was too cold to enjoy being outside.   Very friendly and prompt service with a breakfast menu that has something for everyone. I chose the coconut chia seed pudding to try something need and it was delicious. Nice blend of grains and fruits, a perfect way to start the day.   I would not hesitate to eat here again upon my next trip to Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner with a group of girls.  When I walked in, I felt like I walked into a crappy Vegas lobby/restaurant.  Clientele was what was expected & typical for that part of Scottsdale - at the bar were a bunch of \"brah's\" who like to act like they have money and their respective female counterparts.  Restaurant area was slightly older crowd - especially with the waitstaff, which I thought was unfortunate.  I expected the server to be a hot babe...girl or guy.  Instead, it was a 50-something-year-old woman with no social skills. The food was also pretty gnarly.  We ordered probably 6 or 7 appetizers before we ordered meals.  I only tried a couple of them - specifically the \"warm maytag blue cheese fondue\" with potato chips.  ICK.  The dip was horrendous tasting and looked like what my husband calls a \"wax dart\" if he hasn't, you know, for a while.  The chips were really greasy and just tasted like a potato dipped in oil.  I also tried the \"oven roasted tomato and goat cheese casserole\" with herb toast.  Another ick.  The toast was alright, but the casserole was like bruschetta gone wrong.  I ordered the \"Grilled Chicken Piccata\" with the butter sauce on the side.  It was alright - way too much salt and the seasonings tasted off.    I don't know, perhaps I went there with the wrong expectations.  I thought the atmosphere wouldn't be as cheesy and I expected to eat \"comfort food\", not food I wanted to secretly spit into my napkin.  I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that if I was rating ZuZu based off of the food alone, I'd give 4 or 5 Stars. Unfortunately, some other factors pulled it down. We stayed at Valley Ho, and experienced ZuZu 3 times, for drinks at the bar, for late night drinks and deserts, and then again for brunch. The bar was great - drinks were very good, with creative cocktail options, and good service. Deserts were good, but I felt like they looked a little bit better than they tasted. I'd give them a 7.5 on a 10pt scale. The brunch is what knocks my rating down. We showed and, despite a decent number of ready/open tables, we were told it was a 15 minute wait, then, 15 minutes later, we were seated at one of those tables that had been open that entire time. Not a huge deal. But then it took forever just to get water and order drinks. I'm not sure if the waitress was flustered about something or just forgetful (restaurant wasn't very busy at this point), but she got my wife and I's drink mixed up less than 3 minutes after we ordered. Then it took forever to get her to come back to order food, and then after that it took quite a while to get the food, which didn't come out the way we ordered it the first time. It was eventually taken care of, but as you can tell, the whole experience from arriving to receiving our food seemed like a bigger ordeal than it was worth. One we had our food and everything was correct, the food was great - no complains at all there! But after we finished, it was back to the waiting game: my wife left and was at the pool for 20 minutes before the check was actually brought over to me.  An improvement to the service at the sit-down dining portion of ZuZu could easily add a star back to my rating."}
{"text":"I'm done with restaurant week. I don't understand restaurants' line of thinking. Instead of showcasing good food, they often choose to go the cheap route. My friend and I decided to try zuzu tonight because of their tasty looking menu. We got there early and had a drink in their bar. I had their blackberry mule, which was fine. My friend had a blackberry/gin drink that was terrible. She said she'd had better on mill (which is not a compliment). Regardless, it was happy hour and the atmosphere was fun so we weren't too worried about the dinner.   We were seated outside, which was cute with a fire pit. For dinner, my friend had the butternut squash soup, shrimp pasta, and goat cheesecake. I had the wagyu beef, the new York strip,  and chocolate dessert. The soup was fine but was oddly topped with marshmallows...those needed to be removed. The wagyu beef was tiny but easily the best item on the menu. My real problem was with the entrees. My 'new york strip' came out and looked like a cut of mystery meat in a cafeteria covered in gravy and sitting in a pool of blood (ugh). The first bite of meat was all fat and gristle (actually had to spit it out). I'm not sure on what planet this counts as a new York strip. The waiter asked if our meals were good and I told him not really... I asked him to clarify the cut of meat and he told me that they cook their new York steak like a prime rib in a big slab and shave off pieces for each plate.....ummm they probably should mention that on the menu. I don't like prime rib because (like this meat) it tends to be gelatinous and lacking flavor. Talk about bait and switch. He offered to replace the meal, but I didn't want any of the other restaurant week dishes either. My friend's pasta essentially tasted like buttered noodles with overcooked shrimp. Yuck. She said lean cuisine was better. The desserts were also a massive failure. Goat cheesecake tasted awful (and I love goat cheese)... Chocolate dessert was hardly chocolatey at all. I felt completely mislead. I would not come here again nor recommend it to anyone beyond happy hour."}
{"text":"The best way to describe Zuzu Café is \"eh\". I can't put my finger on what exactly made the experience so blah- it was a combination of the lethargic ambience, mediocre food and average drinks. That being said, there was also nothing terrible, thus the three stars (I probably would have given 3.5 stars if had the opportunity). I dined here on a Friday for lunch and I have heard that Saturday is much more lively and exciting. At the very least, I would give this place another chance on a weekend for brunch."}
{"text":"We ate at Zuzu during Arizona Restaurant Week.  I had the shrimp and scallop cocktail which was very delicious. A friend had the Caesar salad which he said was good. For entrees two of us had the short rib and one friend had the Asian salmon.  Both entrees were quite delicious and good portions. For dessert we had the chocolate cake and the key lime pie. Both were quite delicious - with the key lime pie being very light with a good lime taste.   Service was phenomenal - very attentive server - and the place is so great looking - love the retro look!  Also a big fan of the Red Flower soap in the restroom - great smelling and quite fun name after recently watching The Jungle Book!"}
{"text":"Having the most amazing Green Pork Chili  Breakfast Burrito on the planet.  Come one, come all, this food is amazing."}
{"text":"Very disappointing!!! We went for Easter lunch and everything was awful. Bad service & bad food!!! Kale salad with salmon was blah & salmon was not cooked. Shrimp cocktail had no flavor & were not cleaned properly...yuck!!! Dry French toast & served without maple syrup. When the syrup finally came the toast was cold! Eggs Benedict was okay but nothing to rave about. Would not recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Solid 4-star establishment. While the service is pretty hit or miss (shoutout to Molly, the awesome bartender and Bloody Mary master), the food is consistently above average with lots of options. When I'm feeling healthy, I opt for the Kale salad and Zuzu Smoothie. If I'm embracing the DGAF nature of vacation, I'm going for the stuffed brioche french toast. Great happy hour deals, excellent desserts (I had their coconut cream pie EVERY NIGHT I stayed at the Hotel Valley Ho recently), and enough variety to satisfy every type of palate. They make it pretty difficult to leave the resort grounds when food this tasty is right in the hotel."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is terrible. Three times now we have had the same old, trashy looking waitress. My boyfriend hit the nail on the head when he said \"'Uhh, she should be working at a WAFFLE HOUSE. Not at the Valley Ho!\"  We made reservations and they said they would do something special for our anniversary. They did nothing, the service was horrible, and the waitress looked like she was doped up on tranquilizers. She didn't smile once, or even seem nice. Awful."}
{"text":"Since my initial review, I've been back to Cafe Zuzu many times. This is definitely one of my favorite places to go.   I recently discovered their potato gnocchi. Holy cow, this stuff is amazing!! I'm not a mushroom fan, so I had them sub in heirloom tomatoes, and what a great decision that was! The sauce that they're served in is so sweet and creamy and the parmesan cheese shavings on top are the perfect accent. You've got to try this dish before they take it off the menu (think it's seasonal).  I also recently discovered their fantastic happy hour! It goes until 7, so there's plenty of time to take advantage of the specials. They have a whole menu of specialty drinks that are only $3, in addition to a great appetizer menu. We're planning on going this Friday to take advantage again!"}
{"text":"To say I was excited to try this place would be a huge understatement! I will say... the food was great!  And that's why I gave it 4 stars! I wanted to like our server so much, in fact I did like him, but his service was another story! Had to ask multiple times for water when all 4 of us were out! Every time he said he'd be right back... he wouldn't come for 10-15 minutes! We asked for two separate checks and that took about 20 minutes, and he came back and had mixed them up, and they were significantly different prices. Like i said i was cheering for him, but it was just mistake after mistake."}
{"text":"I stopped in today for bunch with my boyfriend and was waited on by Eddie. We were seated promptly, with a smile, given the yummiest scones ever, and just had all around good service. I got the California eggs Benedict (which isn't on the menu anymore but i saw a gentleman eating it and HAD to ask!!) and my boyfriend got the steak and waffles. The food was AWESOME and the staff was even better. The manager even came to check on us to see how our food and experience was. She has a professional, positive, and friendly demeanor. We really enjoyed ourselves and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This is a place to go, just so you can say you've gone.  It's really beautiful to walk the grounds of the hotel and this restaurant is one if the best parts of the whole place.  All seating is at tables and while there are areas that could work for larger parties, this is a place that specializes in 4 or less a table.  Business lunches, retirees and folks who are staying at the hotel is your normal mid-week crowd.    The service is absolutely perfect - balancing that reserved resort restaurant demeanor with the upscale casual ambiance of the place.    Gotta tell you, I'm not amazingly impressed with the food.  It was very very good - but with all the hype, I'd just anticipated a bit more.  But the decor totally made up for it for me.  Very cool.  Personal note - I love their match boxes!  They are so cute I almost always have one in my purse - and I don't even smoke!"}
{"text":"We stayed here for a staycation and it just happened to be restaurant week as well. We had a great time at the pool. The staff was pretty rude by the pool though. They close about 6. They give you no heads up or last call so when we asked for another drink, the server actually said...\"you can try the bar if you want\". Cool, thanks...is that where you get drinks? Im in the pool. We went upstairs, showered and changed. The room was very nice and clean but a little confusing to find...again, we ran into a staff member who had no idea where to tell us how to get to our room.  We found the complete opposite with our service at dinner. Service was fantastic! I didnt like what I ordered which was a smoked fried chicken but my dates liked the flavor of the steak but said it was a little tough. If I noticed someone wasnt eating their meal, I would've asked to get them something else but she did not so I just didn't eat. Included was an appetizer of some sort ( obviously forgettable) and a dessert of lemon tart and a lava cake which we all enjoyed. VH is only a couple miles from my house so I ended up just coming home. The other 2 friends stayed and we opted out of the pool the next day, which is an option, but the service by the pool left a bad taste in our mouth. Not really interested in giving this place my money again but I dont have to with all the local resorts having summer specials."}
{"text":"I must've ordered the wrong thing. Dangit. And I was so excited to try this place, too. I wanted to be bad and order the grilled cheese. But, I went with a salad. It's the Gruyere cheese that got me. I had to have it. Little did I realize that the lettuce they used would be your standard, boring iceburg. Ick. But, I did appreciate the combination of other flavors, and the thing was massive (took half with me for later).   But, since eating at ZuZu, I've decided that if you go out as a treat, don't order a salad. Order something that's going to atleast have a high start value, like the blue cheese fondue.   Anyway... Have you ever had a roll so good that you thought it was laced with some addictive illegal substance? Uh, yeah. Cafe ZuZu's rolls are UN-believable. Too bad my request for seconds went unheard. I would have even paid for 'em. Words can't capture how tasty these rolls were - warm, fresh from the oven, fluffy and melt-in-your-mouth fantastic.   Service was anything but stellar. Our server tried, I'll give her that. But she seemed a bit scattered. Good thing Paul, the host (and/or manager, not sure) came by to see how everything was... and to confess that, yes, even he is addicted to the rolls.   Will I be back? Doubtful. I hate to valet park, and it's mandatory at Valley Ho. It's complimentary, of course, if you eat at ZuZu, but even then, you have to factor in a good tip on top of another good tip on top of the price for lunch... Seems like alot of effort, doesn't it? It'd be one thing if the food were worth it, but, like I said, I think I ordered the wrong thing. Even my lunch buddy, who had a green chile burger, said the food was just okay.   Cafe ZuZu, you get Cool Kid Points for trying, but I'm docking points off for poor execution."}
{"text":"Living in North Scottsdale we normally don't have the opportunity to venture into Old Town Scottsdale but, recently we did and at some delightful point in time ended up here! My family and I had quite a time deciding if the interior is Mid Century - Vintage - Retro or..?! Whatever it is we all rate it as Fantastic! For restaurants in Old Town this is at the Top of my \"A\" List! Thanks to all the staff as well who helped make our time there even better!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night. Beautiful on the patio. We ordered Scallops. Chicken Penne Pasta (2) and a veggie burger. Half price bottle of Cupcake Chardonnay. Price of a full bottle is $90. Half price $45.00. Such a deal! The portions for dinner were appetizer size.  For 3 delicious scallops, I paid $28.00. \"3\" Penne pasta with chicken was $20.00. Veggie burger was the best deal, $12.00. I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"**NOT recommended for people who like tasty food** Retro cool atmosphere with decent service. Depressing food. Seemed like our meals were pre digested for us. My child ate her lunch and cried. Even the parasol in her cocktail Ho-J failed to lift her spirits. I'm mostly pissed at the 2 hours of our lives that we'll never get back."}
{"text":"Our family came here for breakfast one Saturday and it was great.  Funky, retro setting, friendly servers, and great food.  Loved the granola + yogurt and the stuffed french toast."}
{"text":"Went to a beer pairing dinner at Zu Zu last night for THAT brewery out of Pine Arizona that was fabulous. The beer selection and Meal pairings were spot on and truly thought out. The event was well staffed, the restaurant was clean, the servers were attentive and the food was incredible. I would certainly recommend attending this type of event Based on my initial experience with the chefs offerings and skill set. I did however find it odd that we paid for our dinner at the end, I was under the impression that these types of events would have had advanced tickets sold, but what do I know. #nomnom"}
{"text":"The décor and ambience here is so nice. I loved the entire atmosphere and service was quite good. Breakfast here is such a treat with some wonderful choices. I definitely have to recommend the short rib breakfast - so flavorful. But... it is a very rich morning meal so beware. Outstanding experience - I'll return!"}
{"text":"Pretty swanky little joint with a lot of character and good service... The Bloody Mary bar rocks.  Everything is fresh and good menu selection.  Crispy thick Belgian waffle of greatness is the direction to travel down after a platter of berries and dark roast coffee."}
{"text":"We stopped in to check out some of their new items that everyone has been raving about and let's just say that I left with a smile on my face and a very happy tummy! We shared several items- The dairy-free chia seed pudding is to-die-for... holy moly!!! The new mussel dish is incredibly flavorful and the biscuits and gravy will make your tastebuds dance. Delish!!"}
{"text":"We sat outside and the first thing I noticed was a spider crawling out from either my napkin wrapped flatware or the menu they set in front of me. I murdered him with my water glass in front of the waitress and she didn't seem too concerned with disposing of the body. His corpse remained on the table for the rest of the lunch...  The atmosphere is pretty nice... I've been to the Ho quite a few times since the remodel and I kinda like it. The douche-factor is quite high here... in fact, you might step on the premises and think that this is the factory where they make douches. Anyway, it's fitting that the front lawn smells like shit this time of year. It smells like they fertilize it with dog and human turds. It looks beautiful at least. I have to smell the lawn because I would rather walk the driveway than have to valet park with those half-wits.   Back to the food - we first had a fondue and chip starter... potato chips with a cheese dip? It was both tasty and awful at the same time. I questioned the freshness of the cheese after a few dips, so I stopped dipping. The chips tasted like they came out of a bag, but they were also quite greasy. With their dip, they clearly should've gone with multi-color tortilla chips made from fresh. At these prices, they should be able to afford it.   For mains, I had a Caesar salad with grilled chicken and my lunch-mates both had fish tacos. I found the salad to be quite bland - the dressing was clearly from a tub and the chicken was rubbery and overcooked and dry. This place doesn't cook from fresh from what I can tell - all pre-packaged and frozen. The tacos weren't fishy in a bad way, but the verdict on them was that they were just okay.   The prices aren't outrageous, but they aren't cheap either and for what they charge - they should offer better food. I was disappointed. The drinks in the Ho bar are grossly overpriced. I guess if you have to eat here, you won't die.  This place is so average, it deserves a 2.5/5 instead of a 3. No need to avoid, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. Food was OK but service was very bad: very very slow and missing part of our order that was pretty simple..."}
{"text":"Okay, first I must say how unacceptable it is that I have never been here in my 30 plus years living in Phoenix. My BBF lives right down the street and I have passed by the darn place for years. Was so mad I missed the reinvention of \"Vics\" when it was open here for a bit. I cried when I heard it closed. Well it was nice to finally visit and eat here beyond the Grilled Cheese and Mac and Cheese throw down of course. (They beat my friend's husband but I won't hold that against them. My friend thinks I should though--JK --;o)-- not really, but sort of. lol)  Well this place has a lot of cheese and fish on the menu so I had a hard time deciding what to eat since I am not a fan of either. I so wanted to try their specialty burger but I despise Blue Cheese. A big sigh, since it sounded so great, all other ingredients considered.  I finally decided on the Kale salad with chicken and a side of fries. It was pretty good.  The bread they serve is yummy too. I loved their fries. The sauce they serve with it is Delish!  We went here last night with my NY club and to celebrate a wedding that took place over the summer. I can not speak more highly of the delightful waitress. Sorry I did not get her name but she is an ASU student who has a father that is a professor. Gooooo Sun Devils!  I want to thank her for her kindness. ( she knows why)   All the staff that I ran into were superb and friendly. The bar staffers were efficient and helpful, ( Mytry-lol) even the front desk folks gave us a big wave as we exited the place. The Valet said not one word about my messy car so that deserves a shout out in itself. In all that rain I felt a tad bad for them last night.   I love the retro feel of the lobby and patio area. I can just imagine Frank and Marilyn walking outside.  The restaurant is a bit on the pricey side for those watching pennies but pretty equivalent to the other places to eat in Scottsdale. In conclusion, I would like to go back again and perhaps book a Staycation."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! They have an amazing happy hour, with prices you can't beat! Great atmosphere and really helpful staff!   Sometimes the cocktails are a little off so I've decided to stick to wine when I go there but this is a great neighbor spot that I think some locals miss out on!"}
{"text":"Wow.  A place where I can go with my whole family with no complaints!  Even though the menu has many items that qualify as \"comfort food\", all of the dishes have a modern twist.  The menu has some old standards like meatloaf and pot pie, but you'll also find dishes like seared ahi tuna salad and some wonderful small plates.  While not the most focused menu, it has a lot of options that are all executed very well, making it the perfect place to bring people you don't know or people you do know who do not share you're taste in food.  It's a crowd pleaser.   Service was great.  No complaints.  Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"I ordered a Filet Mignonette and it was absolutely delicious. However, the appetizer, Ahi Tuna, was a bit disappointing. It was overcooked and tasteless. The service was only average but the bill already includes 20% gratuity. I will definiately come back here again for a happy hour but probably not for dinner."}
{"text":"I have had enough of waiting for 45 min to get seated at a trendy breakfast joint that takes forever.  Eggtastic, breakfast club, fill in the name of a place where you sweat outside until a table opens up. That was such a lame thing to do in 2002, I'm no longer permanently hungover with limited options. We came upon this restaurant when we stayed at the hotel. It's beautiful! The restaurant at Valley Ho has great ambiance, comfortable seats, delicious and nicely prepared food and great service. We now go here for breakfast whenever we are in old town Scottsdale. I love their ice tea that comes with a cup of nectar and lemon juice with a mint leaf. For my meal I order the BLT add fried egg with a side of home made thin cut crispy potato chips. I love sitting in their cozy booths and people watching.  I'll be back... sans hangover next time!"}
{"text":"Wow. I literally had the best waffle of my life here. It was the Belgian waffle with the dried cherry butter. I could not stop cursing throughout the meal because it was so good. I had my friend taste it as well and his eyes lit up like a dried out Christmas tree, so I know it's not just me. He had the eggs benedict and also enjoyed it. It had a great (possibly house made) English muffin along with avocado and perfect little poached eggs. The fried potatoes were also crispy and perfectly seasoned. I also indulged in the DIY bloody mary bar, which was delicious. There were a lot of ingredient options and even bacon! I would just say that they need to add Worcestershire sauce and they'd be golden. The service was good and prompt and the staff were all very friendly. It is clean and the building is beautiful. I can't wait to go back! [$30 for two people]"}
