{"text":"This is one of my favorite cafes in Toronto. Sitting in the window first thing in the morning is a great way to start the day.  The coffee is good, of course, as coffee from Ideal is always good. I wish they had larger mugs for \"for here\" coffee. There's usually good treats, although sometimes they arrive from the bakery a little later in the morning than I arrive. They have sandwiches but I've never tried them.  Prairie Boy bakery bakes their bread in the back, so you can leave with a still-warm loaf of Winnipeg Rye. (Do this.)  It can get a little crowded sometimes, and the table layout along the pews is kind of awkward for sharing tables, but everyone in this neighbourhood is so friendly that it all works out.   The staff are very nice, and if you go there even occasionally regularly you'll probably be recognized. It's nice to be treated like a regular. Sometimes there can be a bit of a wait for coffee because there's usually only one person working.   Good wifi, lots of plugs available. You're allowed to unplug the strings of lights if you need to.   Also, the antique wood walk-in refrigerator that takes up 1/4 of the shop is beautiful."}
{"text":"Un café ensoleillé à l'ambiance propice à la détente ou au travail. Très joli espace et beaucoup d'options de cafés. Des sandwichs sont disponibles ainsi que des bagels et des viennoiseries, salades et soupes."}
{"text":"Love the location on Sorauren... coffee shops on residential streets make me feel like I'm in Brooklyn NY.  Awesome coffee.  We love taking a pound of beans home because they're delicious.  Some cookies, scones and muffins that are pretty decent too.  They have sandwiches, but I've never tried them.    Just a few tables, but they are big, and they often end up being communal with laptop-users working away independently.  Love the coffee, and love that they are NOT cash-only!"}
{"text":"This is an intimate Café nestled in the residences of Parkdale. The light ambiance of indie rock in the background and the quiet traffic of coffee goers makes the Sorauren location a perfect study or work hideaway. I was able to catch up on reading without having to put in headphones to drown out conversations.   There is a great selection of local roasts, yummy treats (gluten free cookies and muffins available) and even a soup, sandwich and salad menu.  As an avid tea drinker, I'd like to see the menu include more variety of loose leaf selections. The choices currently include two variations of chai, green tea and the traditional herbal selections of peppermint and chamomile.   I'll  be back to try the gluten free sweets next time."}
{"text":"3 stars.  I went into this place with low expectations considering I have been to another location and wasn't very impressed (you can read my review on the other one in my reviews).  As a result of going in with low expectations I was pleasantly surprised with all that this place offers.  I don't know why this place seems completely different than the other location, but this one is good.  It is not the biggest place in the world, but there is enough seating for people including a nice outdoor patio.  Although there is enough seating, there could be even less because it feels a little cramped to be truly honest.  One of the greatest pluses of this place is the location.  An absolute gem of a spot to put a coffee shop.  Right in the middle of a residential neighbourhood just south of Dundas is great to say the least.  The coffee, as expected; the taste overall seems to be lacking that punch I am looking for when I have an espresso based beverage, but it is still good nonetheless.  The selection of goods is pretty good and they have sandwiches available as well.  If I lived in this neighbourhood down the street, I would probably come here, but it is not a place to go out of your way to visit.  It really doesn't have that wow factor to bring in people from all over the city.  This place was average to just above average.  Not the worst, not the best, but great for the local neighbourhood.  That's it!"}
{"text":"Best Coffee and baked goods in the city, Its an oasis in the city. Friendly staff and the best americano in the city."}
{"text":"What a cute place! It's nice because its not on the main road so it's really quiet. The place is filled with fun and interesting quotes by Gregory Alan Elliott, and there is a nice little area out front where you can sit as well as large windows for sun indoors. The prices are very reasonable and if you buy a pound of coffee they give you a free drink.  I got a sandwich, it was decent but not amazing, but solid. My americano was good, too.  If I lived in the area this would totally be my regular weekend coffee spot!"}
{"text":"Feel like that I found a little secret Caffè in a cozy residential area. Nice coffee,  interior, and reasonable price. High sealing as well!  ;)"}
{"text":"Love the coffee beans to take home. But..... Was almost turned away the other day because I didn't have cash and didn't reach their four dollar minimum to use a card!!! They let me off with a \"warning\" that next time I need to reach 4 dollars if I want to use a card. Never heard of this before! It was a real turn off as if I was inconveniencing them to give them my business. The staff are friendly if they recognize you. It takes them a while to warm up I guess. Despite the weird vibes from the baristas I do like the coffee and ambiance. Bring cash tho!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my I Deal experience. The iced espresso was very smooth. The peanut butter cookie was pretty yummy (but too sweet). I appreciated that they didn't play blasting music. However, I would have liked to see more music variety. Can't decide if the staff are friendly or not."}
{"text":"Very comfy looking interior, nice sun shining in... If the sun is out!  The coffee is excellent, I even buy the Bags to go. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"What nice cozy spot! Was staying at an Airbnb down the street and stopped for a morning coffee and muffin that were perfect. Great service. Would recommend."}
{"text":"HOOKED on their roast! Their cafes are all over, even Ottawa. This is the best. I recommend the cowgirl cookie. They're not giving out the recipe - I asked.  Accessible street parking with an art studio next door and boutiques, grocers along the busy street running parallel."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find that Balluchon Raymond Inc. was closed and in place of it was another i deal coffee location. As expected of an i deal coffee cafe, it was super packed when I arrived. I contemplated on leaving because it was so full, but luckily a seat freed up before I did.  Compared to Balluchon, they changed the layout of the cafe just a bit. There were more tables and chairs to accommodate to the number of customers, though they kept the exposed brick walls and counter the same. They also have a patio open during the warmer weather as well.  You can find the standard i deal coffee menu here and their typical offerings. If you are a fan of i deal coffee and is in Roncesvalles, definitely take a look at this location."}
{"text":"I love this location, it is small but it's bustling with neighbourhood locals!  The benches and table outside is great on sunny days and neighbour watching   Friendly vibe, nothing pretentious.  Enjoyed my afternoon with a butter croissant and a Flat White.  Noticed a lot of people purchasing beans as well   They have empanadas but didn't notice the till I paid (fridge to the side). Will need to come back for that!"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe that would be wonderful to work at, and right near a couple of parks, making for easy caffeination before taking your pooch or child for a wander.    I've been to their Ossington location a couple of times and enjoy their coffee, however this location warrants only 2 stars.  My dad and I walked up to the counter and waited while the barista finished what she was doing.  No eye contact, greeting or acknowledgement of our existence.   Still, we waited patiently.  When it came to our turn to order, no smile or acknowledgement of our wait.  Oh well.  I chalked it up to not having the best of days.  I ordered a latte with almond milk and my dad got the chai latte.  The drinks came quickly, and as we turned to leave, the barista realized that she had my drink with regular milk, and quickly fixed it.  I appreciated that I didn't have to find that out on my own.  I figured that I'd give her an extra star for this.  I took a sip of my latte and grimaced - the espresso hadn't been pulled properly, resulting in a bitter beverage.  Keen to get out of there, I didn't ask for it to be remade, and figured I'd get my hit of caffeine regardless of the taste.  I did my best, but the drink tasted awful, and for the first time in my life, I threw away my latte.  Bleurgh.  Important note: my dad enjoyed his chai latte immensely.  Could be that the barista wasn't having the best of days, but if the management is reading this, I recommend a refresher on customer service and espresso making.  For you Yelpers, if you're in this part of Roncy and really need a coffee, sure, go on in.  Otherwise, walk to the main drag and go to Lit Espresso for consistently good caffeinated beverages!"}
{"text":"Visited this in 2013 when it was Balluchon, and again in 2016 as part of the Indie Coffee Passport.   iDeal (I deal, Ideal, never got the friggin name of this chain) took over Balluchon and has done a good job of keeping it up.  The venue is beautiful. The ceiling, the floor, the exposed brick wall.  5* for ambience alone.  The coffee is average. Not bad, but not awe-inspiring either."}
