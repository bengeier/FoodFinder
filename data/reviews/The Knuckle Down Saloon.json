{"text":"Best blues for a 100 miles in any direction on Thurs, Fri, Sat."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite place to hang out. Great atmosphere, great taps, great staff, great happy hour deals. They've been attracting some quality live entertainment too. The food is hit or miss, but honestly, who goes to a place like this for the food? It's a bit out of the way, but definitely worth finding."}
{"text":"This review is about the food. I work not too far away and am a frequent lunch customer. They have a $6 lunch special that is a burger, fries and soda that is a great value, the burger is big and tastes excellent. Fries are better than fast food quality and service is friendly and generally fast. I hesitate to publish this because I don't want to fight a hundred people to eat lunch there, but this place is a hidden treasure in southeast Madison and deserves to be recognized."}
{"text":"The KDS is really trying to do something here with the Blues, and they are doing a great job.  They bring in blues talent from Chicago every week, and charge about $5 at the door.  What more could you ask for?  I first learned about the KDS when Dave Watts on WORT's Blues Cruise interviewed Mike Wheeler, who was scheduled to play later that night.  On a whim, we decided to go...and have been hooked ever since.  If you like Chicago blues in a laid-back environment, check this place out!"}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed to see the previous review about the Knuckle Down. I just don't think it's warranted. I was there last night, and from the looks of it, everyone was having a great time. On a Thursday, the crowd is a little light early on, so if there's karaoke that night, you just get to sing a little more often :) I've probably been there 30+ times, and have never had a bad experience. And, as a proper update, karaoke is now regularly on Tuesdays, and occasionally on Thursdays, not Wednesday as I'd previously stated."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly when they have time.  Like so many small bars in strange places (this is on the edge of an industrial park) they have a series of quirky characters.  There has been mention of a \"dance floor\" but it's just an area without tables.  I dance A LOT and a decent floor is always a joy.  The reality is that this place is doing good business and Chris is planning some improvements.  Some of the bands he has in fairly regularly will pack this place to the walls (making real dancing almost impossible).  If he could bring his big draws in regularly he could easily fill a place 50% larger."}
{"text":"Lucky to have this Blues Spot in town. They have great beer selection, decent prices, good wait service. Owner is often around, and very nice. Wonderful spot to see live music."}
{"text":"I moved to the area in 2012 and have been looking for place to listen to some blues. Having grown up in Chicago and visiting some great Blues Clubs there, I had died to find somewhere in the Madison area. Well it took me 5 years to find a place that fit the bill. Knuckle Down Saloon may not be a dive bar in one of Chicago's neighborhoods but it did have some decent talent playing there. The also have food in the form of burgers. We arrived on a Friday around 7:30 (music started at 8) as we wanted to get something to eat before the music. The menu mainly consists of burgers but they do offer more than plain and cheese. If you do get a cheese burger your options of cheese include American, cheddar, and pepper jack. I ordered their black and blue burger, a burger with blue cheese. We were not disappointed. Sides included a bar of fried and fried curds. Overall the for was better than we had expected. The beer selection includes a few draft beers included our favorite, Guinness. The only hiccup was they didn't have buns to fulfill our food order but they sent someone or for them and they did everything they could to make it right. That apologized and informed us of the delay and have us each a drink chip. The club did fill up just before the music started and was basically standing room after 8. We will be returning to check out some of the other talent! One side note, we all had a good laugh at the guy who thought the death of Jim Belushi left an opening in the Blues Brothers. He assisted up in a black suit complete with had and yes, dark sunglasses."}
{"text":"As a musician and music fan, my favorite venue in Madison.  Any die hard Prince fan or regular of the Minneapolis music scene knows of a \"music bar\" called Bunkers.  Bunkers is legendary for being a \"dive bar\" or \"hole in the wall\" where you can see world class musicians for a very low cover.  Numerous members of Prince's bands play there regularly to this day and Prince himself was known to sit in.  Famous musicians from John Mayer to Larry Graham have sat it.  But as cool as who plays there is the clientele-- The crowds are as diverse by every definition.  Black, white, brown, young, old-- you might see a 90 year old grandmother dancing next to a 20 year old drag queen.  And for ~$5 to see legendary musicians, why wouldnt you?  There is no other place like that in the world, but in a small way, the Knuckle Down is Madison's version of it.  It's definitely a dive, but not in an unclean or unsafe way.  They book musicians and bands as good as you'll find at any Madison venue, for a low cover.  The clientele is a diverse range of ages and races.  Madison has bigger venues, it has prettier venues, it has venues with better lights and sound, but none of them have consistently as good of music or crowds.  Speaking as a musician-- the owner, Chris, is as supportive of bands and musicians as it gets.  In years of touring I've been treated terribly by lots of venue owners.  Not Chris.  Chris treats his bands like he is grateful to have them.  The food is standard bar food.  Burgers, wings, etc.  Nothing exceptional but you wont be disappointed.  I'm not a huge drinker but my wife likes their drinks.  Definitely a place to go see good live music in a small venue.  Support local business/music."}
{"text":"Madison's Best Blues Bar! Regional, National and international Blues and Soul acts regularly play at the Knuckle Down Saloon including Spider John Koerner. There's a great story as to why this Internatioal Bluesman regularly plays the Knuckle Down... Ask Chris behind the bar. If he's in the mood he might tell you.  Also don't miss local legend Harpo John and the All Night Pounders."}
{"text":"THE great blues bar in Madison.  Chris books talented acts that cater to an earlier crowd than most downtown venues.  Thursday nights Chelsea adds life to an already wonderful live music experience.  I felt comfortable the first time I checked the place out.  I've heard of other places in town that play blues-based Rock, but have been to only Knuckledown for Blues.  It does not disappoint ... well, except the house band's (The 008 band) version of Stormy Monday ....T-Bone & The Allman Bros play it differently !  Keep the Blues alive Chris & Chelsea  ~  Love the Knuckledown  ."}
{"text":"Love the Knuckle Down. The music is great. The prices on drinks are good. Love the staff!"}
{"text":"Knuckle Down Trivia: The wifi password is johnlsullivan. There's a large picture of him on the wall, which the bartender drew my attention to. My friends Google and Wikipedia informed me that he was the last heavyweight bare knuckle boxing champion, way back in the day. Hence, Knuckle Down. So now you know.  I met some friends out to hear the Cash Box Kings perform last night, and they were uh maze ing. But this review isn't about them. Although there is a large stage that showcases bands really nicely, and a great dance floor which surprisingly could stand to be a bit larger. So many of us danced the whole night, and it was a standing room only crowd. What a great time, with fantastic music!   Limited tap beers, limited bottled beers, but most people should find something acceptable to wet their whistles here. Bartenders are fast and friendly, in a low key way. There's a cute, tiny little grill right behind the L-shaped bar, where you can watch all the food being prepared. I haven't tried the food yet, but I know I'll be back for more music soon, and I'll plan to eat next time.  It's a cozy place with a really nice, friendly vibe. Blues is one of my favorite genres of live music, and I think that's mostly if not exclusively what they book to perform here. If that's your thing too, you need to check it out. Tucked away just off the highway. If you blink, you'll miss the turn, like I did :-)"}
{"text":"A quaint tavern, situated on the outskirts of Madison Wisconsin , the Knuckledown Saloon is a step back into finer times.  Complete wide wood paneled walls, lantern-style lighting , and appealing decor , a seat at the uniquely shaped bar not only gets you fantastic service but also a sense of belonging."}
{"text":"Went last night for the hell of it. There was karaoke going on... I sang one song, and the \"host\", a fat, disgusting pig of a man calling himself \"Doc\" made rude comments to me. As my friend and I were leaving, he tried to convince me to sing another. Huh? Dude, you just acted like a total asshole to me and you didn't think we would leave? Secondly, why do you feel the need to cover your soundboard with magnets of disembodied breasts and asses? Disgusting, creepy and pathetic.  We also eagerly await seeing your \"medical license\". Have you considered giving yourself a Lap-Band to lose that nightmarish gut of yours? Asshole.  Chris, the bartender, was alright, but the dead look in his eyes chilled me to the bone... there were never more than 10 to 15 people in the bar the whole time and it was quite the freak show.  Don't think I'll be returning to this dark corner of Madison's bar scene."}
{"text":"Great blues bar. Music Thursday-Saturday. Drinks were great, top shelf available. Overall, very reasonable prices. Acoustics were decent and the band kept it loud enough to listen to and not so loud as to keep you from talking with your friends. Bartender and clientele were friendly and everyone seemed decent and wanting to have a good time. I am definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Five Star Dive Bar :) this place is great. I've been in several times with co-workers but tonight was the best! Tate's Blues Jam! If you're free on a Thursday you have to come in and meet this fantastic man. Fun Fact - the bar has a Tate drinking game that you can play while he's on stage.   Tate and his band were setting up for their set tonight and he stopped what he was doing to come to the bar and introduce himself to us. Not only was Tate telling us about his passion for blues and his mission to keep blues alive, he really just came over to invite us to enjoy some of the wonderful food he'd brought in to share with his audience. Let me tell you - Tate makes a mean batch of grilled chicken (SO GOOD) and his girlfriend made a great pound cake with and amazing rhubarb sauce to go with.   You just don't find places and people like this everyday :)  The bar staff was great, too! They were running a pretty cool \"suicide king\" game tonight. My buddy won a $10 bar credit FOR LOOSING ha!  It's dark as hell in there at first but don't be scared! Get off your high horse and go hang out. I'm sure you'll have a story to tell the next day ;)"}
{"text":"Ordered a medium burger. Sawdust dry well done. Blue cheese had zero flavor. Out of tomato. Onion rings were ok. Will not return."}
