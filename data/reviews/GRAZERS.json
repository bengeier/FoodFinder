{"text":"I've been looking for a healthy, quick and reasonably priced lunch spot for the longest time! I heard about his hidden gem a couple of weeks ago. It's perfect if you're looking for local and healthy (vegan and vegetarian options) food. The prices are great and the food is delicious! The rice bowls taste great and very large portions. The pumpkin hummus is delicious; I highly recommend! A wonderful local business to support!"}
{"text":"Great place with healthy, fresh, delicious options and very friendly, fun staff who really enjoy working with the public.  Everything is quickly made to order, and all vegetables and meats are cut into bite-size pieces.  I admit this seems like a weird thing to mention, but as most places just throw whole pepper rings, tomato slices, and broccoli stalks onto salads, Grazers gets extra points for taking care of this for me."}
{"text":"I'd say this is a super legit choice. The quality is there, and the prices are very affordable. Grass-fed beef and free range chicken are used, and there's a high degree of customization available, with many interesting sauces and varieties of hummus.

 It's good to have a new restaurant in town that focuses on organic/local ingredients, and the menu is deep enough that you won't get bored. Definitely worth your time."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Not many vegan options around and this place does it right. The owner is the most pleasant woman, too. Never to busy to say hi."}
{"text":"Grazers provides healthy alternatives to fast food. The owners are so friendly and cater to both vegetarians and carnivores alike. I've had a baked potato loaded with toppings: Taco meat, cheese, salsa, etc. The combinations are endless. And you don't feel like you need to sleep after you just ingested a 50# burger loaded with grease! The portions are large as well so great quality and quantity for the price point. Quality as in free range chicken, grass fed beef, organic veggies... Great for those on a diet or those just looking for great food at a good price."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this little place! Perfect for gluten-free / lactose-free organic fare. Locally sourced ingredients. Highly recommend! (don't forget to try the hummus pizza!)"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and you know how hard it is to find good vegan food.  Grazers was just the right answer.

The food is well made, good quality and, without exaggeration, must have been three pounds worth of brown rice, homemade hummus, fresh veggies, etc.  Fortunately it came in a to go container because it took two sittings to finish. 

Not to mention how pleasant and helpful the staff is.  It's obvious they enjoy their work."}
{"text":"Such a friendly staff, delicious food for all walks of life, and an adorable downtown area surrounds. Highly recommend for anyone that enjoys good food in a kozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Grazers is hidden in downtown Kent, but will soon be known since it is being put in the Student Center in Kent State University. The food is fresh, high quality, and healthy compared to what is offered downtown. Its a nice refreshing concept. The staff was incredibly friendly and helped me out the first time I went, unsure of how to order. They have a good selection of foods and many toppings. Its a small town feel and unique in that after a certain amount of visits you could get your photo and favorite recipe you order placed on the wall. I would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The large wrap is enormous. Easily two meals. It's also totally delicious. I had the grass fed steak on whole wheat."}
{"text":"This is REAL and delicious food!!!! Love the vegan and gluten free options and it is so flavorful!! The staff is always courteous and helpful. Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced kinda like chipotle. Food is served in styrofoam containers."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It popped up on the iPhone restaurants suggestions and Yelp suggestions and it is wonderful. The owners are beyond friendly the place is quaint and very charming. My boyfriend and I went on a whim to eat healthy and try something new, it soared BEYOND all expectations! The chipotle aioli is just a perfect blend, the presentation of the food, the variety of both vegan and vegetarian options, can be made allergens free, everything was all just great! Definitely my new go to restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Recently I was heading to the Kent University campus and was looking for somewhere to grab a healthy lunch beforehand and came across this place online. We got here and the people couldn't be friendlier - it was clearly a team there - and they wanted to make sure you were getting something you'd be satisfied with. 

Their model is similar to chipotle in customization, but offers far more options and healthier ones. I loved that you could get something mexican, greek, or many other styles. 

They have lots of GF, Vegan and Vegetarian options, but aren't in your face about it. The rice based bowl I had, was great and I'd certainly be back here."}
{"text":"Simply put, Grazers is the best restaurant for miles and miles. The healthy, organic, and best of all delicious choices is amazing! As a vegan, I can't recommend this restaurant enough!"}
{"text":"Great place! They have a Belly app coupon for a free hummus.   Their Pita chips are only $1."}
{"text":"Got a rice bowl. Menu says pick 5 topping but they were extremely short on that and the chicken. Bowl was mainly rice with little veggies and chicken. Decent flavor. Ok price."}
{"text":"This place is a must try.  We stopped seeing all the good reviews in Yelp.  I got a wrap with pulled pork.  The pork was very tender and not a piece of fat to be found.  The ingredients in the wrap were fresh tasting, defiantly no processed foods in that wrap.  I was not disappointed at all!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I literally make a point of coming here every time I'm in the area! 

The food is great and super vegetarian friendly. The team working here is friendly and engaging -- just ask them for recommendations on what to get! --- and the portion sizes are enormous. You can't go wrong with anything you get here."}
{"text":"I love it here! From the feel, to the people, to the food, pure perfection. When you're on the road, these places are a dream come true. Came in on a Thursday (vegan Mac n cheese day!) and had a simple side of vegan chili with cheddar cheese on top. Absolute heaven, beans the right texture, full of yummy tomatoes, pinto and black beans. Only $4 amazing. 

My friend had a brown rice bowl with chicken, salad, cheese, cucumbers, onions, tomatoes and bacon, with chipotle aioli dressing. He said it was real good, for $9 a steal. 

Come here for sure for the charm and the good home cookin."}
{"text":"This is a FANTASTIC little restaurant with amazing ownership and super tasty food. Being a Paleo-style eater, this place is right up my alley. Honestly, my girls and I loved it.....we will make this a regular stop on our list. So excited to have found them!

UPDATE 2/4/16: Their cilantro lime hummus is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Food was fine.  People compare it to Chipotle, but it doesn't let you pile on the toppings.  You only get a limited number, and they are very skimpy.  I literally had 2 broccoli crumbs as I searched for the broccoli I ordered.  For the price, you can do much better."}
{"text":"It had been a few months since I visited Kent and I was sad to see Laroush, a staple for those of us looking for natural health-conscious Mediterranean food, had closed.  Thankfully Grazers fills the void quite well.  They have the Mediterranean bare necessities that most Kent shops have (good home made hummus, garbanzo beans, falafel) but seem to have a more general wraps and veggies vibe going.  The staff is very friendly.  Everything I've had has been tasty and filling, with a very home grown feel as advertised.  I highly recommend checking this out."}
{"text":"great food... I haven't been this happy in weeks!
Thank you! 
Such a treat to eat something healthy on the road."}
{"text":"Delicious food for a reasonable price. They do lack on the veggies though. Chipotle aioli is yummy."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Being a vegan I decided to drive quite a distance to try it and it did not disappoint. The service was so helpful from the moment I walked in. They gave me a sample of their delicious vegan chili and talk to me about some of the ingredients. They told me they bake their falafel's which I found refreshing. We decided on a baked falafel pita with tomatoes, banana peppers, lettuce, tahini and hot sauce. It was so delicious! I also got a brown rice, black bean burrito with vegetables and vegan sour cream. The vegan sour cream was to die for.  The hummus was half off so I ordered cilantro lime hummus and pumpkin hummus. I wasn't very excited about the pumpkin hummus but it completely exceeded my expectations. It was like the dessert hummus! Although I give the food at five out of five the service was truly amazing there. Well worth the drive.  Check this place out"}
{"text":"Cute place where you can customize your orders. Came here for the vegan options. Vegan Bf gave it 3 stars because the ingredients was fresh, reasonable priced, and vegan friendly. I give it a 2 because it was just alright. The ingredients were fresh, good priced but had no flavor what so ever. I like my ingredients cooked properly and the carrots, mushrooms, and broccoli in the wrap were raw! Only flavour was from the vegan sour cream and salsa. 

1. Taco Meat Pizza ($9) but substituted the taco meat with the vegan chili and vegan cheese. It was decent, not much toppings on it. Wish it had more bell peppers on it. 

2. Garlic wrap with vegan chili ($9), vegan mozzarella, carrots, broccoli, spring mix, mushrooms, colored peppers, salsa, and vegan sour cream.  Need more flavour and more vegan chili in it. 
 
Overall, decent spot to grab healthy food @ reasonable price, vegan or not."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food! The hummus is outstanding. Every time I go there, everyone is so friendly and welcoming. It's a great environment. My favorite is their wraps, they're huge, and so filling. Go visit!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was no disappointment. I've been a vegan for awhile now and it's great to find a place right down the street from my house with delicious options. I walked in on my lunch break and the owner helped me create my own first meal (Falafel rice bowl with veggies and dairy-free cheese) and was just the sweetest lady ever! You best believe I'm ordering some vegan pizza this weekend."}
{"text":"The vegan mac and cheese is super delicious! And they put it together with vegan chili. It's much more than a salad place and I appreciate all of the vegan options, including dessert. The people are always really nice, too."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a light snack and found the hummus and veggies to be just perfect. It was our first visit, but will not be our last."}
{"text":"A hidden gem within the city of Kent. An establishment that actually has quality ingredients, a wide selection of options, assortments of vegetables, at a terrific set of sauces (highly recommend the chipotle aoli). From building a rice bowl to a fresh salad, Grazers has something for everyone. 

I'm jealous of the students that get access to Grazers from the comfort of Kent State's Hub. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Grazers is sort of a hole in the wall place. Really customizable to what you want to eat and any dietary restrictions (vegetarian vegan gluten etc) you might have. Pretty good food. And they make their own hummus! Super helpful people running this place that make it a great experience."}
{"text":"We always pop into Grazers when we're in the area and it's consistently great. Tons of healthy options,  vegan choices and they even have Dayia Cheese! Everything can be made as a salad, wrap, sandwich, quesadilla bowl, etc. I absolutely love their falafels on a salad. Knowledgeable, attentive and very friendly service. It's a hot spot and can get very busy around peak hours but they hustle to get everything out quick. Definitely worth checking out!!"}
{"text":"Very ma and pa type place. The owners were great to interact with and were very helpful. My wrap was huuuuge. I could only eat half of it and I'm a big guy. And the chipotle aioli sauce is the bomb, don't get a wrap without it."}
{"text":"Grazers was pretty good! I wanted to try it because they have great gluten free accommodation and they did not disappoint! The workers were friendly and communicated how important food safety and taking care of people with allergies is to them! I had the gluten free pita and it was great i recommend trying it. The only reason i didn't give full 5 stars was because i didn't particularly care for the steak but i will be going back and trying a different protein next time!! Overall great experience"}
{"text":"Love this place. A new vegan friendly restaurant in Kent, OH. Food portion is huge; ingredients are fresh; versatile toppings. Definitely gonna visit again. Too bad I forgot to take any picture, because their food is too delicious and completely into it."}
{"text":"Grazer is really great, the chipotle aioli was wonderful....tried them for the first time tonight, had heard good things.  Doesn't look very impressive inside or out, looks like a family-type operation, no 'chain-restaurant' fancy looking coolers, ovens, etc.  But the food was awesome!  Fresh, appears to be natural stuff all around.  A lot more variety than Chipotle and a touch more expensive for the quantity you get, but worth every penny and you won't go hungry.  I had a brown rice bowl with chicken, mushrooms, onions, bacon, and put some of the chipotle aioli on it, and it was fabulous, as pedestrian as that combination may seem on the surface.  Homemade tomato salsa was also very tasty.  My wife pulled together her own take on a greek salad, and raved about it, I tasted it and was impressed too.  They're a little different in that the meat (at least the chicken) is pretty ordinary, unspiced, but it makes sense because you could put just about anything on it, so flavors might clash if you marinated it or flavored the chicken otherwise.  Nice people, service was quick - unfortunate that it's takeout only, but hopefully they can grow it to be a sit-down place too.  Try this place!"}
{"text":"Fresh and flavorful. Lots of great items to add to your order.  Veggie chili was great! Pumpkin Hummus crazy good.  We had a chili bowl, Greek chicken bowl, and vegetarian wrap.  Everything was Delicious!
Only a few cafe tables inside, most people order to go."}
{"text":"Great food with even better owners. As soon as you walk into Grazers you will meet the incredible owners who hand make all of the dishes. They are honest and caring people who will make you want to come back! The food is also DELICIOUS, especially if you are a health conscious eater. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to go if you want a healthy meal. I got a chicken bowl and loaded it up with veggies (and lots and lots of chipotle aioli). The owners, Stacey and Carl, are great and make it a point to get to know their regular customers. You can even get your regular order added to the wall so you don't have to fill out a new one every time you go. Delicious food for vegans, vegetarian, and gluten-free too! Some of their most popular items are the vegan mac n' \"cheese\", which is sold every Thursday, and the hummus which comes in so many flavors and is half price every Tuesday! Chocolate. Hummus. Enough said."}
{"text":"I am becoming quite a regular at this awesome little restaurant! Every time someone asks where we should go, my immediate reaction is 'Grazers'. They have something for everyone (meat, vegetarian, vegan) and are super friendly. I love their mac 'n' cheese and their hummus selection is never lacking. They are always trying cool new flavors since sure to check the littler fridge next to the counter. 

Their menu is easy to read and use which definitely made me feel better the first time I walked in. They don't skimp on the portion sizes either (usually. I've only gotten one order that wasn't super filled of all the times I've gone). Also, they use the Belly program which I absolutely love. 

This is my go to for take out food now!"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Visiting from Phoenix and always looking for healthy options when I visit.  Thanks to Yelp!, I found this little gem.  I love how you can customize your order. So many options and they have BAKED Potatoes!!  Everything is so fresh and tasty. Make sure to try their hummus!  They even have PUMPKIN Hummus!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing, the owners are very friendly and fun to chat with. I love how they have a charcoal grill and cook healthy meats. The garlic wrap was extremely tasty, can't wait to try other menu items! Looks like I found my new favorite lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Kent is a fun city, who doesn't love coming here? You might be tempted to eat at some of the new restaurants around Acorn Alley, or maybe chow down at your favorite bar. Well I found a hidden gem that is worth your time, money, and love.... just follow the red brick road.

Grazers is a family owned carry-out restaurant that has a unique take on food... customize your meal! The way you order is similar to the food chain Chipotle, select your base (wrap, salad, rice bowl, baked potato, tortilla chips), and then you pick a protein (chicken, beef.. etc), add your topping, sauces, and BOOM! You're ready to chow down. 

What makes this place special are the ingredients: free-range chickens, grass-fed beef, gluten & dairy-free cheese, and no MSG. They buy locally when possible (which in turn helps the community) and they never hesitate you help you design the perfect meal.

The prices are very reasonable and the people are super friendly (and funny). I suppose the only knock against the place is that it's carry-out only, but that shouldn't deter you. It's fresh, fast, and it's unique. Come out and support these guys, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is a must go! I can't eat wheat or eggs which makes going out to eat complicated and sad. At Grazers the menu is clearly labeled and they even let me look at the ingredients for their gluten free pizza crust (FYI egg free). I got a regular size bowl and it was so big I had to take some home which hardly ever happens. I can't imagine what their large size is like, probably big enough for two! Ingredients were fresh and staff was great. I highly recommend even if you're not vegan or gluten free. It's a tiny place but don't let that put you off."}
