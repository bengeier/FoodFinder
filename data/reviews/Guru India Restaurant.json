{"text":"Most authentic Indian food in Calgary, and best of all it's in the South! We've eaten here 4 times since December,  everything is delicious,  and generous portions. I particularly liked the paneer,  naan,  lamb, butter chicken, and vegetable dishes (haven't had any of the fish dishes,  so I can't comment on them)."}
{"text":"Good food here!! I drive all the way here even though lots of other choices close to me. This place will not disappoint. The naan is also made fresh and is very tasty. 
I believe it's family run, the Staff/main server is welcoming and nice."}
{"text":"After reading reviews of this new restaurant, my husband and I decided to give it a try since it's in our neighborhood. It's tucked in a small strip mall.  A plain little place which is very clean, bright and comfortable.  The service is friendly and attentive, and the food is delicious.  Lunch specials are $9.95 for meat dishes and $8.85 for vegetarian.  I had the lamb Curry which was very tender and delicious.  Rice and naan were free. The Jasmine rice was fresh and soft with a nice texture.  The naan was soft and fluffy.  I also had the chai tea which was rich and enjoyable. My husband had the chicken tikka.  The chicken was tender and flavorful.  As we were leaving, the owner couple stood at the bar and waved good bye.  I felt like we just visited grandparents place. So warm and fuzzy... We'll go back."}
{"text":"We just dined with friends there. Great food, less creamy, nice and clean, good ambience, good quantity. Worth trying if you are in south Calgary.

2nd Review - Jan 01, 2018

We highly recommend Guru, we have tried their catering for large event  to small house gatherings. Great-quality food and they are amazing and truly try their best to accommodate your requests. Paramjeet and his crew are very pleasant and professional. Piyush"}
{"text":"I have traveled quite a bit and this is the best East Indian food. Please go here and give it a try! Their lunch specials are great and they give a good amount of food at any spice level. I had the lamb curri and the chicken masala and I honestly can't say which one I like better. Def will be back!"}
{"text":"One of our favourite Indian restaurants. It's super close, too. So far we haven't ordered a dish we don't like. All dishes come with rice, which is makes it a really easy choice for takeout."}
{"text":"This place is fairly new but it's quickly become our favourite Indian place in the south. I've yet to have anything on the menu that wasn't excellent; give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service - homemade and you can tell - authentic North Indian cuisine. Everyone is very pleasant and the atmosphere is enjoyable. We love their selection of vegetarian dishes - esp the paneer! On our first visit we ordered a spinach paneer and chicken masala and it was awesome. Not only that but the plates came to us nice and hot! Yes it is small and yes it be deceiving but don't let it. Highly recommended! We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Service was outstanding! The aloo tikki was by far the best I have ever had. The onion chutney was mouth watering we ate 2 with our appetizers & meal. Quality of chicken was excellent very tender. We had chilli chicken and chicken korma both very similar in taste (they should be extremely different) I came to the conclusion that they made a big batch of butter chicken and modified it. Especially with the chicken korma didn't even have the right color. The rice was light and fluffy everything did taste great but not very unique."}
{"text":"My new favourite Indian restaurant in Calgary! The butter chicken has a unique flavour that brings me back to the restaurant weekly. Would highly recommend for anyone who likes authentic, delicious Indian food with a little bit of spice."}
{"text":"NOT GLUTEN FREE!! I had the chicken masala. I asked the waitress if there was any gluten/wheat flour in it to thicken the sauce. She said there wasn't. There was... and I paid for it for 48hrs.  Will never eat there again. :(:(:("}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Calgary for his business trip this past week and happened to stop by here. Although it is new, their food was amazing. I have never tasted such authentic food, it was savoury and each bite was wonderful. We ordered the saag paneer and butter chicken as well as garlic naan. The female waitress made the experience even better as she has such an enlightening personality. A great experience overall and I would definitely stop by if I'm back in town! Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Best butter chicken I've ever had.  The garlic naan bread was chewy deliciousness. We will be coming back! Thank you Guru India!"}
{"text":"Decided to go big my last day in town and I'm glad I chose Guru India! Upon entering the aroma of Indian spices was very inviting and the staff was very respectful.   Ordered vegetable jalfrezi and malai kofta and honestly both were a 5/5, the vegetables in the jalfrezi were cooked just enough and crisp and the malai kofta had an incredible sauce. Rice came with both dishes which is rare for most restaurants and we ordered 2 garlic nans on the side. I have to say the nan's were some of the best I've ever had as they were fluffy and cooked really well. The owner was very sweet and despite being so busy took the time to speak to us. I was shocked to see all 5/5 reviews for this place but I can truly see why the detail to every dish is crazy and I would definitely recommend this to all Indian food lovers!! Definitely will be back in the future!!"}
{"text":"One of our most favorite Indian places in Calgary. A Hidden Gem in the south. This family-run restaurant boasts the most delicious authentic Indian cuisine. The butter chicken has a beautiful flavor. Other than the naan bread , most of the dishes are gluten aware. The food is fresh and the portions are large."}
{"text":"Awesome place, very good portion and reasonable price. A gem at an unexpected location."}
{"text":"The food and the service here were amazing! Our first time to try any Indian food in Calgary (we are from Edmonton) This was the best Indian food we have ever had and we eat a lot of Indian food. I had Malai Kofta and I have never been more impressed with a dish. The flavours went together amazingly. My boyfriend had the Mango Paneer. He loved it. The staff were very friendly and went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. The only thing that made me sad is that they are closed on Mondays and we wanted to go back for lunch before we left Calgary. Thank you for making us feel welcome in your city."}
{"text":"LOVE IT! We ordered Malai Kofta and garlic naan, medium hot and it was good enough for my indian spice level. Samosa was fresh and hot. The date and tamarind chutney was homemade and no food colouring in curries or chutneys. That is what I love about this restaurant. Food felt fresh, home cooked , and delicious. I was waiting for such restaurant in the South East calgary. Service was good and quick even when the restaurant was half full. two thumbs up!  definitely would come again."}
{"text":"What a the tidy little hidden gem, tucked in the shell gas station strip mall this little restaurant hits the spot for a authentic cuisine. It is amazing how often the best places are in the most obscure locations.

The food is ready quickly and and very flavourful."}
{"text":"Do you like Indian food?  Are you gluten free?  Are you vegetarian?  Then this great new neighborhood Indian food restaurant is for you.  We were out late last night and looking for a restaurant that met those last two criteria for our daughter and stopped here to give it a try.  We were pleasantly surprised to find they met all three.  They have an extensive vegetarian menu and being Northern Indian style food they use no flour and all menu items are GF!!!!

They give you free rice so all we needed to decide on was what to order.  We decided to keep it simple as it was our first visit and they are new.  The restaurant is small, clean and welcoming and they are still awaiting their wall hangings.  This was at 8:00 at night and we were the only people in the new restaurant so you are never sure.

The service was excellent and the advice from the server was more than we usually get.  And all the food was prepared fresh

We started with Vegetable Pokora that came with three sauces.  They arrived quickly and were very delicious and the sauces were house made and added a lot to the flavour.  For our main course we had Aloo Saag (spinach and potato creamed) and Vegetable Korma.   The aroma and flavours of both dishes whey were outstanding.   And as I am not V/GF we also tried their naan bread and Butter Chicken.  I was impressed with these two dishes and especially the smell of the Butter Chicken and the taste  of their sauce.  All portion sizes were good and the prices were in line

After dinner we met the chef and owner who had moved to Canada from the US and found out about his Northern Style cooking.  It was right up our alley and met or exceeded our expectations.  

Definitely going back and as well will be doing take-out.   If you live in the Evergreen area I would recommend that you give this new place a try.  They are also open for lunch and have smaller portions and a great lunch menu.   It seems they are a hit with all their neighbouring businesses.  They are next to Rips Pub and the Shell station

Right now as an opening special they are also giving 15% of your order and as well they have a current Groupon offering."}
