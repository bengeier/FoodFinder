{"text":"I was dying to try their food! I went to the food truck west valley event to see them and another truck that were going to be there! I was really dying to try this food truck! Well, Unfortunately I must be honest. I am brutally honest in hopes that they will hear from one of their customers. I write these reviews in hopes that business owners and employees can learn from it. I have to admit, I was a little disappointed. I opted for the Hawaii 50 for $9. The food quantity is very good. It was enough for my wife and I to share. The Sandwich has pineapple, so it is very soggy and it was lacking in the flavor department. After the first bite I was wishing that we tried something else. The person standing out front, who needs to work on his appearance, said it is their best seller. It left a lot to be desired. We also had the loaded fries for another $9. They were good, but had too much cheese sauce. I was a puddle in the middle. I would drizzle and not pour the cheese on the fries. I never thought I would ever say that, but it really was too much. They were swimming in cheese and hard to eat even with a fork. They have BBQ sauce on them that just confuses things more. Just a bit much of everything. The picture doesn't do it justice. They looked delicious but again the actual flavor was off a little. I would loose the bbq sauce and actually cut back a little on the cheese sauce. They added salt to the fries and honestly I would loose that too. Back to the greeters appearance. He was very nice, but appeared dirty and sloppy. I don't want to offend anyone, but when you are representing the company, you must watch your appearance. If I might make a recommendation, they need to all be in at least matching T-shirts. We were at a food truck event and they were parked next to the speakers that were way too loud. I felt sorry for them, but they should have moved or had the speakers moved. They were really struggling to hear the orders. Food came out fast and hot, but they need to review the recipes. Sometimes less is more. I know they are all about cheese, but they need to simplify things and watch over usage of the cheese.  They did take credit/debit cards. Overall I give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"When they stuff your grilled cheese with brisket, and bacon mac & cheese, you really can't complain! The Gangsta grilled cheese on buttery sourdough bread was to die. We probably shoul dhave ordered 4 instead of 1. Then there are the Loaded Tots. Cheese, bacon, tons of green onion, TGCT has their flavor profiles on point and cannot wait to dine here again!"}
{"text":"My first food truck experience did not disappoint! What's not to love....smoked meat, Mac & Cheese in between cheesy toasty bread! The sandwich had great flavor and I am already looking forward to my next Gangsta Grilled Cheese!"}
{"text":"Just went here on my break for work. The food came out fast and delicious and the service was great. I got the loaded tots and they're definitely gonna help me get through the work day"}
{"text":"So good and a great team that works the truck! they made the experience great and anyone who puts mac and cheese on a grilled cheese obviously knows there audience. Will definitely be going back !"}
{"text":"There's a misconception about Kung Fu out there; the idea that Kung fu is all about martial arts. But that isn't the whole picture. Kung fu embodies much more than fighting. In fact any ability resulting from practice and cultivation could accurately be said to embody kung fu.

With that in mind, let me tell you about my experience with the Gorilla Cheese food truck. I was at the Lost Lake Music Festival, passing between the various vendors looking at a bunch of overpriced crap, when I spotted a gentleman in a Run the Jewels hat who looked deeply satisfied in his soul, eating what looked like a grilled cheese but with a inch-thick layer of macaroni where normally just a sad single slice of american cheese sits, with bits of meat jammed in wherever they could fit. I inquired, and he pointed me at a big orange truck with a gorilla on the back He couldn't speak, his mouth was full, but I could tell he was happy.

I waited in line for a bit (it was the longest line of all the food trucks, which tells you something there), and at the register I met a cheerful man with a generous belly named Jeff. I asked Jeff if it was his business, and he said yes. He clearly took pride in his work, and told me a bit about the sandwiches he had. I told him what I wanted and moments later a man called my name from inside the truck and handed me that same model grilled cheese as the other fellow. It has pulled pork in it. It cost $10, which, I dunno if you guys have tried to buy food at a music festival, is a pretty smoking deal for a sandwich the size of your head. 

I was watching people with sad, cooling bowls of velveta shells with a handful of the kind of crap bacon you put on a miserable salad to make it feel like less of a mistake. I looked at my own sandwich and felt like I had been saved. It was delicious. It was an orgy of warm macaroni, toasted bread, pulled pork, and a dash of BBQ in my mouth. I inhaled it, and it satisfied me like no sandwich has before. 

Jeff runs a food truck. Jeff makes cheesy sandwiches. Jeff's Kung fu is off the fucking charts. Five stars, and God help me if I don't die alone I'm gonna have the man cater my wedding."}
{"text":"This truck is amazing! Tried the club, caprese and the 5-O and all were amazing! Club was my favorite as the siracha mayo was perfect! Their bread is grilled to perfection and the staff is so great! I hope to find them around town more often...best grilled cheese food truck in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Their cheesy fries are the best thing I have ever eaten in my life! I constantly check their website to see where they are but they're not open often! Wish they had a shop so i could go there more often!"}
{"text":"Pro: Good sandwich (I got a gangster sandwich).

Cons: Charged way to much. DO NOT PAY IN CREDIT CARD!! They added a $2.5 tip to a $12 order when I payed with a credit card. And I did not have the option to even write a tip I just had the option to sign) Also the man who was in charge of accepting payments(who also sounded like the owner/ manger) was overworking the guys cooking and acted like an absolute ass to them, some of the people helping him in front, and to a customer."}
{"text":"Food trucks are like field trips for the 9-5 crew. I'm so happy they were here to break up the lunch spots that our office frequents!

Although on the pricier side, these entrees are large and you could easily split it with a coworker/friend. 

I had the original grilled cheese. It was seasoned with a delicious blend and wasn't overly-cheesy but pretty greasy. My favorite part was the crusted cheese that had melted over the sides and crisped like a chip. 

The tots were awesome and had that delicious Cajun seasoning on them. Next time I'll try the loaded tots. 

The guys that work there are funny, nice, and fast!

Overall a great cheat meal for the week!"}
{"text":"Oh that ooey, gooey, cheesy grilled flavorful-filled sandwich, with a variety of options of fillings to choose from -- each one making your tastebuds jump for joy and mouth salivate simply by thinking of sinking your teeth into that perfectly toasted and crispy bread, oozing with amazingness... and cheese. *drool* 

Hungry? Go get a Gorilla Cheese sandwich or loaded tots! Not hungry? Get a Gorilla Cheese sandwich or loaded tots, anyway! Why, you ask? Well, because you will be hungry, and you can't go wrong with having a ah-mazingly glorious grilled cheese on hand. 

I seriously wish this magnificent food truck would just park in front of my house... or better yet, follow me around all day. THAT'S how good these sammy's are! Seriously. The smell lures you in and then one bite and -- BAM -- end of story, you're hooked. But it's not a bad thing, though... it's a very very good thing!

Been stalking Gorilla Cheese for about a week now and was about to call it a night until my stomach and tastebuds would not let up until I drove to Food Truck Friday to get a Hawaii 5-0 grilled cheese. This sammy, oh.em.gee. If it was the last meal I'd have on this earth, I would die one happy girl. It's loaded with slow-smoked pulled pork, grilled pineapple, grilled green chile, bacon, tomato, basil, bacon jam (yea, you read that right!), and siracha aioli, then grilled to perfection. And the tots?! You haven't lived until you've had the loaded tots. Trust me! 

Not only is the food absolutely mouth-watering and satisfying, but the crew working is beyond wonderful! Geoff, the mastermind behind the Hawaii 5-0 sandwich (and others I'm sure) is so incredibly sweet, attentive, and personable that I feel like we're basically family. Dave, the one who cooks all the deliciousness ordered, is also quite amazing, and super friendly. The gal taking the orders (I can't remember her name... so sorry) is so kind, friendly, and funny, too. I'm telling you, stop by and meet the crew and before you know it, you'll be treated like family, which is a rarity nowadays. 

I can't wait to have another Gorilla Cheese sandwich... and soon! (Check their website for locations on the calendar.)"}
{"text":"The Gorilla Cheese truck is legit! The Hawaii 5.0 is the way to go. It was delicious!! Devin and Kat never disappoint!"}
{"text":"The guys came to my work in Scottsdale today and let me tell you people.....it is NOTHING like Brian O. said in his review! These guys have a total hit on their hands!
I got The Gangsta Grilled Cheese and split a Loaded Tot with my co-worker. I was tossing between the The Gorilla Club and this.....when I asked him which one....he just said the Gangsta is like nothing you have ever had. AND HE WAS RIGHT!!! I love brisket and love mac and cheese! The bread was crispy and the tangy sauce was something to lick your fingers to! The tots were just as awesome! On the elevator ride up we had to sneak one in our mouths and bring on the water works! Same tangy sauce was on those tots with the bacon and green onion....not to mention bacon!
Not to mention the cool jams coming out of the truck while you are waiting! TWO THUMBS UP!!! Give me more!! Way to go guys!!"}
{"text":"This food truck shows open, but they are not where they state to be located. Wild goose chase. Their phone number seems to be deactivated. Just a waste of your time."}
{"text":"I have to say the owner did right by my son. We were at the Food Truck Night in Peoria AZ a few weeks ago. My son only wanted plain mac and cheese. There was one truck there that advertised mac and cheese but for some reason didn't have it that night. My son was disappointed. When we came across the Gorilla Cheese Truck they said they didn't have just plain mac and cheese, but then the owner asked his young crew to make some special for my son. I have to say I thought was was pretty awesome to give us great customer service. Thanks guys for putting a smile on my sons face."}
{"text":"I bough two sandwiches from this truck and they accidentally charged me $221.00. I've been trying for months to get my money refunded. I have texted, left numerous messages and no return calls. They finally answered the phone once when I called and requested I text them my bank statement and info, which I did.. I have texted them and called them numerous times since and no response and no refund. Be careful here.. No sandwich is worth $200.00"}
{"text":"It was ok, but disappointed.  I kept thinking that this was going to be a cheese explosion or something.  Not really.  I ordered the chicken salad.  It was cold and whatever cheese that was on the sandwich was melted.  Didn't notice any cheese flavor,  because there was too much chipotle sauce.  Ordered the side of tots.  That was huge and the tots were hot.  $14 for the tots and sandwich.  I'll roll onto the next thing I find in the jungle.  This gorilla was not satisfied."}
{"text":"I am giving them 2 stars for the food because it's definitely the best grilled cheese truck you can find in Arizona. The communication trying to get ahold of them to potentially use them for a wedding or event feels like it's close to impossible. I sent them an email 3 weeks ago and had my fiancée call leave a message and I even tried to send a message on instagram with no responses what so ever. I find it so odd that all these food businesses are extremely terrible with getting back to you. But whatever it's their loss."}
{"text":"Omg I dream of their grilled cheese sandwich stuffed with delicious mac n cheese..... their loaded tots were also amazing!!!! If you haven't tried this truck you have to find them asap. It will change your world!!!! Yummmmmm"}
{"text":"To summarize up front for those just looking for the nitty gritty:
- Convenience (I mean, it's mobile):  5 stars
- Speed of service:  4 stars
- Employee attitude:  4 stars
- Food:  3 stars
- Value:  2 stars

The Gorilla Cheese Truck was the first in the series of weekly food trucks that my office building management company has put together for us tenants.   Management notified us all about a week in advance that the truck would be out front and, not surprisingly, it resulted in quite a turnout.  

I decided to give it a try and walked out front around 11:20am.  The truck had been \"open\" since 11am, and there was already a crowd of perhaps 26 people who were either waiting on the food they had ordered, or waiting in line to place an order.  I waited in line for about 5 minutes, ordered The Gorilla Club ($9) and a half size of Loaded Tots ($5) and was able to pay with credit.  

The wait was reasonable given the traffic, maybe 8 minutes at most. The kitchen was cranking it out pretty well and both my sammy and tots came out together which was nice (I noticed some people before me got their tots or fries before their sammy was ready).  

I took my food back to my desk and chowed down.  The Gorilla Club (turkey, tomato, avocado and bacon with Havarti on sourdough) was mediocre.   The turkey appeared to out of a package like Oscar Meyer or something of the sort and I expected the size of the sandwich to be a lot larger considering it was $9.  If I walk up the street to the neighborhood sandwich shop, I get a much larger / tastier sandwich for the same price.  The Loaded Tots (tots, truck-made queso, crumbled bacon, tangy sauce & diced green onion) were good but again I didn't feel like the flavor had much pop to it.

Several of my colleagues, in assessing the line outside, asked me if I thought my meal was worth $14.  I did not."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of my local Las Vegas grilled cheese food truck, so I felt the urge to try this one from Arizona when they rolled in to town. Or at least that's what I'm officially saying instead of \"ooh, pretty colors!\"

The Gorilla Cheese Truck is a good-looking truck that has joined the Great American Foodie Fest lineup for the first time. This festival, now held in Henderson, has a lot going on including that aforementioned local Vegas grilled cheese truck. But it's hard not to notice Gorilla Cheese Truck when walking around, and even harder to resist the idea of cheese and meat.

So I pulled the trigger on a Gangsta Grilled Cheese ($9), which was surprisingly not priced at an event premium upcharge compared to the photos that I'm seeing on Yelp for this truck. You might wonder what carbs are doing inside of carbs, but the bacon mac 'n cheese somehow just works inside the sourdough. The cheese and the BBQ cream sauce are also delicious. I do wish that there was a little bit more noticeable meat (in terms of the brisket & pork), price be darned, but it was quite satisfying overall.

(UPDATE 10/10/16: my friends wanted to try this truck, so I tagged along. I was still hungry, so I couldn't resist picking up the $7 Bacon Jam Caprese. Although the bacon wasn't very prominent, the gooey mozzarella and juicy beefsteak tomato made me so happy. I was considering revising my review after I tried other grilled cheeses / melts, but this one works. Oh, and the taste that I got of my friends' Hawaii 5-0 was also quite nice. Pineapple works, yo.

I'd love to see Gorilla Cheese Truck again next time the Great American Foodie Fest rolls around. There's plenty of room for their takes on cheesy sandwiches."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Gorilla Cheese Truck ever since I found them on Yelp. Thankfully, they've changed their listed address, which was previously just the P.O. Box of the business itself. And yes, like a tool, I once ventured out with the intention of finding them, only to unexpectedly arrive at the Glendale Post Office.

Gorilla was recently at Food Truck Friday West and are known to make regular appearances there. I decided to order their \"Gangsta\" Grilled Cheese for nine dollars with an extra side of fries for two bucks. This sandwich includes both mac and cheese and smoked brisket that's covered in a BBQ cream sauce and colby jack cheese. All of their sandwiches use sourdough bread, which is the ideal way to consume grilled cheese.

The sandwich, as a whole, was actually decent quality and superior to what I've tried at the \"Original Grilled Cheese Truck\" that has since left Phoenix. What skews their overall review, however, was the fact that the fries were grossly over seasoned and way too salty. I let my girlfriend sample some and she quickly pointed out the error before I could. Between the two of us, we didn't feel like finishing them.

Despite the shoddy fries, I'd still recommend them - but would probably suggest just sticking to their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Yummm... worthy splurge!

Gorilla Food Truck came to my work. I ordered the OG and a side of tots. The OG was a perfect, classic grilled cheese. It had all the elements of the perfect grilled cheese: perfectly toasted buttery bread, oozing gobs of cheese. Tots were hot and plentiful and coated with a delectable seasoning. I hope they come back soon!"}
{"text":"Truly a disaster. We made plans to come to where I work. Person confirmed 30 days in advance but then completely could not be reached the day of event. 100% disappointed and completely do not recommend."}
{"text":"This truck came to my office today and let me just say omg!!!!  Best grilled cheese sandwich I have had in Phx.  Split the Gangster grilled cheese & and The bacon jam caprese.  The gangster grilled cheese had bacon,pork and Mac n cheese with a tangy sauce, so yummy!  The bacon jam was out of this world, tomato,mozzarella, basil and bacon jam.......nuff said!!!  Can't wait to try the tots, they looked awesome!"}
{"text":"I saw a feature on the evening news covering the Great American Foodie Fest in Las Vegas and decided to give it a try. One of the reasons was the story on the Gorilla Cheese Truck. I sought them out at the fest and ordered the Hawaii 5-0. It was the best thing I ate at the food fest over a two day period. The flavors were unique and the texture very appetizing. I can see why this truck is so popular. I plan to visit them again and maybe try the Gangsta although it will be difficult to pass up the Hawaii 5-0. If you see this truck, run to it."}
{"text":"I was actually craving a grilled cheese today and the Dairy Gods answered! I spotted the bright orange truck on the way to get something else for lunch actually but will always rule in favor of a food truck, I feel it's a perfect opportunity to try something you don't usually get. Cool, friendly people. I ordered the Gangsta and tots. Bread was perfectly toasted, cheese was delicious, everything mixed really well I just wish there was more BBQ sauce actually. I couldn't tell if there was even any but I did get green chili pieces (maybe leftover from another sandwich) it was an unexpected spicy kick. Full of flavor though! The tots were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, with a dash of Cajun-like seasoning throughout. Hope they come back to this area again soon!"}
