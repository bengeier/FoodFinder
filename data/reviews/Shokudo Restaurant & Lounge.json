{"text":"Worst experience ever. Sat for 20 minutes with no service or menu. New people walked in and after standing at the door for 5 minutes were seated and got menus instantly. We walked out at that point. The 20 minutes sitting there the staff had no clue what they were doing...didn't know which table the food belonged to. They were pouring two canisters of coffee together, taking payment whole holding a plate of food. We weren't the only ones that walked out without service either!  No skill!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came to this place one Sunday afternoon after checking their menu online and decided to give their AYCE a chance.  Even though they are a restaurant that serves Japanese food items.  Their lemon chicken, sweet and sour pork taste better than most Chinese restaurant.  This AYCE restaurant offers a few items such as Tako/Hokkigai sunomono, ika during lunch that no other restaurant would.  Also most soft drinks (including orange juice and green tea) are included in AYCE.  I highly recommend ordering tuna/salmon maki instead of sushi as they more are generous on their meat in maki.  We will definitely come back for their AYCE in the future."}
{"text":"Glad we tried this place! Both the cooked items and sushi were exceptionally good -- better than any other AYCE we have tried in Calgary, and some items even better than our favourite non-AYCE places (this may become our go-to takeout as well).  The sashimi was beautifully cut and tasted very fresh, and the agedashi tofu was perfect.  Pizza included was very tempting, but we didn't have room this time!  Service was efficient, friendly, and this may be the first and only time no orders were missed or mis-delivered at an AYCE restaurant!  Hope to see this place succeed."}
{"text":"Sushi is great and affordable. I like that they have an all you can eat option as well as a set menu. My husband and I order takeout from here quite frequently."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place is permanently closed. I wasn't able to try it but had to put a star rating to post."}
