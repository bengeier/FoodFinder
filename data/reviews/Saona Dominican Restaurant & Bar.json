{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch at Saona. I had been to a Dominican restaurant elsewhere in Charlotte and would say that Saona was a lot better. While I was waiting for my friend to arrive, I order some beef empanadas, which were a really nice starter and pretty cheap. For my entree, I ordered some fajitas...very savory and delicious! My friends ended up sharing some plantains and yuca fries. The plantains were so juicy and tasty that we ended up ordering a second batch. Our waitress, who was very friendly, suggested we try yuca fries and she was so right about them. They came with a nice garlic dipping sauce, which tasted excellent with or without the sauce. Writing this review definitely has me craving some more! I would come back again."}
{"text":"This place is a damn joke! Worse servers. They have nothing from the menu. Food is ok. Better off going somewhere else! 

Este sitio es un relajo! Mejor voy a Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this place. We love the rice and beans. I was so upset when I thought they were closed but it was due to the transition of new management. The new owner kept most of the same  menu items and is very consistent. My favs are the grilled chicken with green peppers and onions, plantains, yuca and empanadas!!!! All seasoned and cooked to perfection!!!!!"}
{"text":"Giving two stars is about the best compliment I can give this place. Walking in it was awkwardly quiet and empty (later on I could figure out why) but the space looked promising as it was large and had pool tables. The menu lacked some of the best tasting and most popular Dominican staples I expected to see. The food I did get was below average at best. The waitress who helped me was friendly and nice, but the owner shocked me with his lack of customer service. After asking the waitress to speak with the owner if he was available she came back and said the owner didn't want to speak to me. Not five minutes later he walks by me to turn down the volume to the TV and ignores my presence as I offer a greeting. I had to wonder if I had ever met him before and had upset him in some way! 

This was a terrible disappointment and I would recommend that no one tries this place looking for Dominican food. It would leave an impression that is unfair to the Dominican culture, and I am Dominican."}
{"text":"It's one of the ugliest restaurants I have ever walked into during my lifetime. As soon as we walked in we had to start guessing on whether the place was open or they were renovating an ugly, rundown house.

The customer service was amazing! Our waitress, Norma, was outstanding! She made our wait time a breeze.

We had to wait a long time for our food (about 45mnts), but it wasn't bad to have to wait; the food was really good and fresh!

We ordered Chimichurris and empanadas (chimichurris are dominican burgers, and empanadas are meat, vegetables or cheese patties), and everything was really good; we enjoyed all of our food."}
{"text":"I stopped here today because I was craving tacos & I always drive pass & see the sign for taco Tuesday where tacos are $1.  I walked in & the place was empty except for a girl in the back eating, a man at the bar, & 2 girls sitting at a table. First off, the place is atrocious. Ugly old furniture, old ugly paint job, & tables that were busted up. What a dump! The one girl behind the counter walked over to the table with the two girls & explained that whatever they ordered was not ready. She gave them the menu & talked to them for about 2 minutes. She then walked back behind the bar, out of their sight, threw down the menu & started cursing in spanish. That was a major red flag for me. She then walks over to me & asks what I want. 

She explained that the tacos only came with onion, chicken or beef & cilantro. I asked her if they have the green salsa which is as important to me as the meat & the filling. She said yes they have the green sauce. I also asked if it came with lime & she said no but she would give me lime. Okay so I'm hungry & I don't feel like shopping for tacos so I ordered.

Long story short they did not have the green sauce. That was not the kicker though. One of the girls at the table brought over the glass she was drinking out of & showed them the dirty cup. The waitress gets her & the friend plastic cups with water. The waitresses demeanor was so awful,  the girl said \"you don't look happy to be here\". The waitress now accompanied by the other waitress that was in the back eating said \"what?\" The girl then said \"you don't look too happy to have us here\". The waitress made a hideous face & rolled her eyes. At this point I had seen enough. I grabbed my tacos & walked out never to return again. 

The tacos
The chicken was dry. They actually did already come with lime but apparently Ms. Atitude did not know that as she gave me about a whole lime in addition to what was in the bag. Too  bad the limes were all old & had not one drop of juice in them. The beef tasted as if it were a part of another dish but they used it in the tacos. It tasted like stewed beef which I did not like. It was also greasy like it had been sitting in whatever juice they cooked it in. 

Welp yelp I can cross this one off the list at least. With all these great taco places in the area I'd never go back. I'd rather go to the taco truck in front of compare foods & pay a little bit more for good service & fresh food."}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day and had a horrible experience. Server had an attitude because she couldn't hear our order because the music over the radio was so loud. We ordered and spent a total of 3.5 hours here between ordering, waiting for our food and then waiting forever for our bills, then to get our change and cards back. Once we gave her the cards to charge it took her over 20 minutes for her to give them back because she made a mistake on them and didn't know how to fix it so started taking other peoples orders. We only got them back because we went up to complain about it. 

They served tables that arrived after us. Then when they brought our food we didn't get everything we ordered at once. Beans came out once some of us were almost done with the rest of the food. More than 1/2 of us finished before others got their food. Then when we were getting our bill we finally got our empanada that we ordered that was missing. 

Carnitas were burned, white rice was bland, I ordered yellow rice and never got it. To stones we ordered were never made until we were almost all done with our food. I understand when people are busy and respect that. I was a waitress years ago and get how crazy things can get. 

However, when we placed our order we were only guests there for quite some time. Then they got busy but they should still serve guests in order they arrive and make sure they serve a persons entire dinner order together not the rice and meat and about a half hour later the beans and soup. 

We never got an apology and the waitresses stinky attitude didn't help. 

The one thing our guests ordered that they keep coming back for is the sancocho and that will probably be the only thing we go back to order and most likely as carry out because the rest wasn't worth it. I should add this is not our first visit here and every time we come it's something different but just about every time we've come we've also experienced the waitresses attitudes. Some don't know English and get mad when some that travel with us don't know Spanish. Either way their job is to serve the customer if they can't do that happily, they shouldn't be working there."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and yes they are open.  Please update the status. We ordered roasted chicken, salmon, rice and beans and yellow Rice.  It was 2 plates enough for 4 people.  Prices are extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"This place right here is hittin on all cylinders. The oxtails be soo good  make u want to slap yo mama.... I went home, slapped my mama. And woke up in the hospital. The food was excellent!!"}
{"text":"I found this spot because it was on reaturants.com and I would be able to use my certificate to get 10 bucks off. I was excited because Charlotte doesnt really have alot of authentic food spots hence diversity and food is low. I saw some reviews on FB and my and a friend went to try. The staff is nice and will recommend and explain the menu. I got the #20...i think. Grill chicken and i got a half side of plaintains and yuca. My friend got the #17 which was fried chicken. My chi ken was well seasoned and the presentation was great. We also tried the passion fruit juice which was great."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but this place was horrible. Dirty, poor service, 1/2 the menu was not available."}
{"text":"One word... HORRIBLE!!!! First the place is not attractive at all. But, we have been to places like this before and they have turned out to be a gem, so we decided to give it a try anyway. We are seated and proceed to ask for appetizers. Nothing we would ask for they had. Finally, the waitress suggests something they had and was not even on the menu. After we order, two out of the four entrees were wrong. We had to then wait for them to bring them out a second time. After we got out entrees we never saw our waitress again. We finished eating and waited and waited... And waited some more for someone to even acknowledge our presence.  When we were finally fed up with waiting we waved at one of the other waitresses who took her sweet time to come. We then asked her where our waitress was and explained no one has been bye to even see if we needed anything. She then just brought our boxes for left overs and left again without an explanation. After another 45min of wait for someone else we got fed up and went to the bar area where we asked once again where our waitress was and if anyone was even planning on bringing is the check. We then got the lame excuse that our waitress had an emergency and had to leave and that we should have just asked someone else for the check. I am sorry! That is not the response customers deserve after waiting for more than an hour and getting half of their food order wrong the first time. No customer service what so ever at this place and food is not even that great. In my opinion: don't waist your time or money at this rat hole."}
{"text":"Great food. Terrible service. Probably the worst I've ever had. Please train your staff correctly!"}
{"text":"The actual building needs major remodeling. It's a true hole in the wall, but if you can get past the looks you will not regret it. 

We have never had any issues with the service, they've all been welcoming. The food is delicious and although we have closer places near our house, we prefer the hour drive just because of how good the food is. The prices are good and you get a lot of food for it.

We will continue to be loyal customers."}
{"text":"Been here twice. The first time, I went during the day. The food was gross, the furniture is old, most of the tables were wobbly, and some of the chairs were torn. Naively I went there a second time, this time it was at night. At night time Saona turns into a bar, the bartenders were horrible, you had to shout or wave in order to get their attention and they seemed to be more interested in talking to each other then actually serving their customers. That night a horrible brawl erupted. Instead of the security guard helping and breaking it up he stood in a corner watching while the bartenders laughed. Other customers had to step in and break up the fight while the Saona employees did nothing. The least the employees could've done is call the police."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and must say that their rice and beans remind me of a New York style Dominican restaurant.  This is a very good thing if you're originally from NY and have been looking for good Dominican food.

Service is ok, but let's all be real in why we go to Dominican restaurants; rice, beans, pollo guisado, Rabo guisado, and the like. I read a review where someone's feelings were hurt (a Dominican client) but they don't really explain how their poor review ties into how the food taste.  My 4 star review is bumped to 5 to help offset their bias.  Saona's strength is their beans - they're awesome.  I wasn't happy with the breaded version of their chicharrón de pollo but maybe their boned version is not breaded and just seasoned which I prefer.  Everything else I had (Rabo/pollo guisado) was really good too.  Server was friendly both times."}
{"text":"Best Dominican food I've ever had. The service is super great and the servers are very attentive. Recommend this place 100%."}
{"text":"The DJ SUCKS. BUT 

The place is a little outdated but the food is AWESOME and DELICIOUS. You do need to wait a little, but not more than I would expect. For the trained palate, you understand that quality food at good restaurants takes time to cook (you want fast food, go to McDonalds). 

The servers are funny and friendly, and the bar is good. I dont want to say how great the pricing is because I wouldn't want them to raise them.

The floor is spacious and has enough TVs with the games playing. I give it a 5 star as a restaurant. The reason it got 4 stars is because its a 1 as a night bar.

DJ SUCKS. Everything is good until his guaremates llegan, se sientan atras con el a fumar su hookah y oir dembow y trap. Everyone likes dembow but geez change it up a little and cater to the clientele, not just your buddies. A veces mi novia quiere ir a bailar y no la puedo llevar a saona (por mas que quiera apoyar negocios latinos) pk desde que llegan dos o tres guaremate el tigre nama ta chambea y hala, me tiene podrio ya. Even during Halloween and the days that it gets a bit more full, you can tell people start leaving because the DJ fails at setting up the mood. In a latin bar you expect merengue, bachata, salsa, reggaeton, dembow y trap, viejos y nuevos, no solamente lo que lo panita tuyo quieren. Even after placing requests to the DJ Guacala, I felt he ignored me and a couple of other ladies that were requesting songs. Nama le falta que sirvan limonada coco en bar y no vuelvo. Hopefully DJ Saquenlo de Ahy gets to read this post.

Oh they got a couple pool tables and a very spacious dance floor. The place is huge so you may see the parking lot with various cars and it would feel empty inside, dont let that fool you. Anyway go during the day, eat the delicious food and take some to go. Nightlife somewhere else."}
{"text":"Complete trash! The food was horrible-the freakin Mofongo was so wet and gross. This place is super dated and looks like shit especially from the exterior; it looked closed. The restrooms were dirty. We were literally the only people there on a Thursday night at 7. The fish with coco was freakin tilapia like wtf is that? The chicken was oily and full of bones. The white rice was the only thing edible. Punta Cana is hands down the local best Dominican spot. I dont how this place has a 4.4 rating on Google!"}
{"text":"Omg! This is my husband's & I second visit and their food is just amazing! It was worth the wait given today is Mother's Day!

This trip I ordered the 1/2 Chicken with White Rice, Beans and Plantains - my belly was in heavy! And, I have enough for leftovers! My husband ordered Grilled Chicken, White Rice, Beans and Plantains!

Highly recommend this Dominican Restuarant, you won't be disappointed!!"}
