{"text":"My family and I love this place. The pizza is always excellent and the service is just as wonderful. They are fairly new and still have some organization to work out, such as timing with getting the food out, which is why I only gave 4 stars."}
{"text":"We have been here several times since they opened and have always had a good experience. The 1st time was last Jan for my husbands birthday, we had a large party and our waiter (sorry, can't remember his name) was great. Large parties can be a pain, but we never had to wait to be asked if we wanted another drink, etc. My husband and I went back about 3 months later, had the same waiter and he remembered us...including my husbands name! Pizza is very good (it's very thin crust which I like) and I always ask them to leave it in a couple minutes longer than normal because I like the crust a little crispier. Always comes out right. The Capo is probably my favorite, but the Aloha, Meditteranian, Buffalo Chicken and Marg pizza are all good as well. Last time I was there we had to wait for a table and we ordered a drink at the bar...I ordered a Manhattan and the bartender was quite thrilled to \"finally make a real cocktail\" Funny! The manager has always come around and asked how everything was."}
{"text":"WOW, this place blew us away.  Went there with my wife and two teenage kids and we all vowed to go back soon.  We ordered a variety of food since it was our first visit.  Started with a Caesar salad, very good dressing and croutons.  As happy as I was with the delicious pizza (awesome crust and very flavorful) and calzone (huge and great tasting), the Italian oven baked sandwich was my favorite.  Unfortunately, my son only allowed me to have a couple small bites but man was it good.  I will definitely be ordering one for myself when we return.  We thought the price was very reasonable in comparison to other \"good\" pizza places we eat at in the Phoenix area (no, not your cheap Little Caesars) and we all left full.  Tony Sacco's is definitely a hit with us!  I'll post pictures the next time we go."}
{"text":"Pizza is fantastic and the server was great. Unfortunately, the young girls working the door don't understand the importance of serving the customers who are actually there instead of those that may come. We walked in and were told it would be a 20 min wait, asked if we could sit in the open booth. She told us they were saving it in case a group of 5 or 6 comes in. 15 mins later they sat my table of 4 in that booth."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was fresh and tasted great. We had pizza and wings. Kids even loved it. We Will be back."}
{"text":"So I am a regular at the other Tony Saccos located in Indiana. This one just isn't the same. The food was good. I had wings but the bartenders knowledge was subpar and they really didn't have a great selection of beer like the other location. Doubt I return."}
{"text":"Not exactly impressed.  The Caprese salad had welded basil... pizza was very good.  They offer happy hour after 9 PM but close the kitchen at nine...  The server was ok, good forbid you are excited about your job.."}
{"text":"I like their pizza, but sadly I had to change my review from a 5 star to a 2 star for their poor service.  They don't really seem to care about their regular customers.  We used to go there once a week and every time they would ask, \"Is this your first time here?\"  Same servers wouldn't remember us (a family of 4 or sometimes 6 including my in-laws) from the weeks before???  Carry out is better if they get your order right."}
{"text":"We love the pizza and food. Service can be a little slow at times, but not many places to go out near this location, so hope it sticks around!!"}
{"text":"Last couple times we ordered out, the pizza was too greasy. Bummed because when the place first opened it started off great. I think they're just too busy to take time to be mindful of olive oil they're adding or maybe the cheese they're using has changed. I don't know - hard to tell.  I still crave it once in a while, but it's easier to talk myself out of the indulgence knowing how oily it has been lately."}
{"text":"Good pizza  have been there several times at basha annual day turkey day food drive. Stop at tony s stand and was told 1/2 price pizzas on tues and Thursday ordered pizza the over heard pizza only 1/2 price dine in only if I knew I would wasted my time cancelled and left"}
{"text":"Friday 530 pm and you are out of budlight draft ? Do I need to call bar rescue for you ??"}
{"text":"We had one of the house pizzas - so so good! They use really high quality ingredients, which is evident in the taste of the pizza.  We came in with a large party of 17, and for a restaurant that just opened and doesn't take reservations, they handled our group really well! For the most part we got our orders in a very timely manner, which was a pleasant surprise considering how many of us there were.   I also recommend the garlic rolls - the bottom of the bowls they come in are full of butter/olive oil and perfect for dipping!   Cool decor and ambiance, too. Not hokey like a lot of Italian joints."}
{"text":"Tucked in behind Bashas, a hidden gem in Chandler.  Half off pizza and appetizers on Tuesdays.  I love the Napoli pizza which is meatballs and ricotta.  Very good!  The hummus and lasagna are excellent too!  The service is hit or miss but it's a good spot with great food and it's relatively inexpensive.  Never really had to wait long even on Tuesday's."}
{"text":"I love their pizza and wings and it all tastes great. and I hope the place stays open because people would be missing out."}
{"text":"Went here at the recommendation of a friend and saw great reviews so was looking forward to trying a new place. Restaurant was cute. Ambiance nice. Then our server came and it went downhill. We asked about happy hour - he said only M-F even though everything said \"everyday\". We pointed that out and he didn't seem to care. Just said he was new. We ended up asking the hostess who confirmed it was everyday. Guess he was not too interested in upping his average check price .... We'd probably had an app and drinks if he knew his stuff. Ordered pizza that was pretty good.  Caprese wrap  - the most bland think I've ever eaten - which made sense after I re-read the menu and realized it was missing the basil and olive oil. Kids meatball and cheese flatbread - my son loved it after we had to convince the waiter that it was actually a menu item. Supposed to come with a side of pizza sauce but we had to ask for it after the food arrived.  Kids salad - the adult version came out meaning it had tons of onions and no cheese (seems like intuition would tell you that 3 year olds don't generally eat onions). Ordered with ranch but we had to ask for that too after the food had arrived. I'm guessing he expedited for himself. Filled up our diet soda with regular - I could give him that if not for all the other issues. Underwhelming verging on disappointing. Not sure the pizza was good enough to take another chance."}
{"text":"Great food, terrible service.  Our waters were empty right when got the pizza, never refilled.  I called to order a pizza and was left on hold TEN minutes to place a take out order.  Hopefully they can get it together.  It takes great food and great service to make a successful restaurant.  Good luck."}
{"text":"MUST TRY! The first time I went there I ordered a custom pizza. I asked the waiter what he suggested. He told what he thought was good on the pizza. I instead, still, ordered what I wanted and it was just ok. We went back took his advise and it was soooooo good! Still thinking about it! It was a really great place."}
{"text":"The sausage & peppers sandwich has to be one of the top 3 I've had. Definitely coming back to try more from the menu!"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok. We tried the aloha which is hawaiin pizza. All the pizzas are thin crust. So if that's your preferance it's good. Otherwise don't expect a chewy thick crust. However, the bruschetta was amazing! Service was a bit disorganized and flighty but the manager was nice. I'd go back for the bruschetta."}
{"text":"We heard this place had amazing pizza.....we thought, how good can it really be?? Um, delicious, mouth-watering, etc etc. Love the blanca pizza (think thats what its called!) The meatballs are very good as well."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service!! I can't wait to go back. We went with a large group and sampled a lot of different items off the menu."}
{"text":"Have been coming here since they opened two years ago. In a nutshell - really like the pizza, though we always order it extra crisp. Service can be hit or miss as staff turnover feels a little high and not sure there is much training before turning new staff loose on the floor.   However, I have one big negative and that is they have no filtration on their water. Water tastes AWFUL, fountain drinks and tea are funky too. Ordered bottled water last visit and paid more for Italian water than my husbands beer. PLEASE - filter your water or offer an alternative for bottled water. Considering you can buy 16oz bottled water at about $0.10 per bottle, selling them at $1.50 each would bring a nice margin."}
{"text":"Very good food however, we had to wait  over one hour and forty minutes for our food order... watched multiple tables with the same issue get up and leave. This was the fifth night they were open. They really should have had a softer opening as if was evident there was no structure or organization to handle the client load. We will return but, will wait until the service bugs are worked out. They did the best they could with a tough situation."}
{"text":"Me and a friend went in for dinner and we're seated instantly.  Or server came and we ordered  drinks , pizza . The food was great  , the service  was even better . THANKS TO SAM our server we had great service. I will recommend to all my friends. Happy  Holidays ."}
{"text":"First time at this new restaurant. The food and service were outstanding! Our waiter Paul was fantastic! Great salads and pizza. We will be back."}
{"text":"It was okay, nothing spectacular. ordered garlic knots and a pepperoni pizza. table beside us were given dough for their kids to play with, but we weren't offered any for ours. minus 1 star for that."}
{"text":"first timer earlier this week. very kind and helpful staff. pizza is good. meatballs after great. good happy hour.  have been back second time in a week. same good service. will be back again"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this neighborhood cole fired pizza as we were regulars at Anthonys Coal Fired Pizza on the East Coast. They were written up last year in USA Today as possibly the best pizza in America. So the bar was high here. My job tonight was to do a preliminary dinner as my wife was with the girls this evening. Grimaldis has been good since leaving Florida. Great salad and good coal fired pizza but no one can beat the management at Anthonys in Brandon, FL. Marcus and his team are incredible. He remembers his customers and you always feel welcomed. He trains his employees to be as good as well. The pizza is a 10 and the baked wings a 12!  . Well, enough said about Anthonys!  The salad with the garbanzo beans was OK. Nothing special. I ordered the margarita pizza with ricotta and onion. I am use to the \"pizza done well\" tag line of Anthonys meaning the crust is dark and crispy. You have to like pizza that way. The crust here was thin but not as crispy but not bad. The sauce---blah!  Now granted, my wife is Italian and makes great sauce/gravy, but this was bland!  Looks like ketchup!  I was going to take any leftover pie home so that my wife could taste a coal fired pie only 2 miles from home. I left it!  We'll stick with Grimaldis until we get back East!"}
{"text":"My friends and I got here around 7pm for cold drinks and ordered Greek pizza and some buffalo wings. The food was fantastic and the service was so good too.  I will most likely return to this location and going to update the rating to five star if i get the same kindly service and the food again."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Granted, we came during off peak and that can either be a good thing or bad. For us it was great. Had the meat ball app (awesome!) and the capo pizza. The crust was amazing. Light and crispy. I don't eat the crust but I felt like I was eating artisan bread. Service was great as it should be for off peak times."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza! Looks like yelp will not allow me to post a short review. So here I am writing some additional text to make sure that it meets their criteria to let you know that they serve fantastic pizza! Wonderful pizza! Very very very good pizza! I know I don't work for them. Just found them a couple months ago and love them!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. New to the area so the staff is still going through growing pains but an awesome job overall. The only downfall to this place is parking. Absolutely horrible. You need to park away from the restaraunt in Basha's lot or over near Starbucks."}
{"text":"Pizza is fantastic!!!   Nice to have a great pizza place close to home.   I think I found my new pizza spot.  Wish they had gluten free so my wife could join me and the kids.  We had large pepperoni and cheese with half spinach and mushroom...  It was all amazing.   Even my picky eater daughter ate it up."}
{"text":"For those that like brick oven pizza it's a great local spot. We dined in for the first time and had phenomenal service tonight. Had the hummus appetizer and it was surprisingly good, also loved their craft beer on tap and the pizza is one of our favorites in the east valley. It's a cross between Grimaldi's and Local Eats. The thin and occasionally burnt flavor of a coal pizza along with the sweet tomato and basil flavor of a more traditional pizza. College games were on TV and the environment was relaxing. Please go and support the local places to keep some things open in the southeast Gilbert/Chandler area!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have the best pizzas in this area. The bar is always fun and they have many specials including happy hour throughout the week. Go here if you are looking for a great atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, but the water tasted bad. The owner said it was filtered water, but my tap water at home does not taste that bad. Anyone else notice this problem?"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.   If you have more than 4 people do not go here.  Whoever the idiot is that designed the seating here should be fired.   Is this place still around? Haven't been back since...."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed... Went here with really high hopes. Walked in the door and was seated right away shortly after a short server resembling snookie arrived. She got our drink order and we ordered hummus. The hummus was brought by the server a few minutes later and the water followed after the appetizer about five minutes later. We ordered our food two pizzas and wings. The pizzas came and were pretty good but where where the wings? I asked the server and she said oh right let me get them ten minutes went by and we were long done then came the wings they tasted like baked chicken that did not have time to cook correct .... Probably because the server forgot to ring them in and the kitchen rushed them. All in all the service wrecked the entire experience food was marginal but I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was great! We had the meatball appetizer and the margarita pizza. The meatballs had a crispy outside and soft inside, with a nice red sauce with a tad of siracha that made it slightly spicy and extra delicious! The pizza was good, smooth creamy sauce, dough was cooked to perfection. Crispy outside soft and chewy inside! The place is nice looking, good outside seating, and had good waitstaff. :) The food looked better in person than some of the pictures on yelp."}
{"text":"Went here to try based off previous  reviews.  Glad we stopped  in food and service were very good. Both in my party had sandwiches.   Had the sausage and peppers, and the  chicken parmigiano sandwiches.    They were huge.  Bread was a french roll that was crispy.  Didn't get soggy.   Still trying to figure out the Sunday Ticket advertising, with only 4 tvs.  Will definitely  go back  for the food."}
{"text":"Coal over pizza is superb.  Order the Antipaso...lots of meat and cheese - won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Food is good however 2 of the 3 times I have eaten there I have issues. First was lipstick, not mine, on my wine glass. Second was dirty plates dropped off at our table. In between I tried to get a pizza to go. I called it in at 11:00 in the morning to be picked up at 6:30 PM. I was having a party at 7:00 when I got there at 6:25 they said it will be another 20 mins or so. Sorry not gonna happen. I ended up going to Bashas and getting something from their Deli. I get they are new so if you go expect some \"new\" issues. It's going to be awhile before I go back. Too bad because I live right across the street."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and been pleased twice.  Pizza is really good and is kinda similar to rosatis.  I am a new York style pizza guy, but these guys have the new York ambience to keep me eating.  They have a full bar and the happy hour process are good.  The music and lighting is really nice.  Definitely someplace you could bring a date."}
{"text":"Great food, poor service. Wine selection very limited and not great. Bad water. We love the food and would go more often if service were decent."}
{"text":"Got an email from the restaurant yesterday that they've added gourmet coal-oven  hamburgers to their menu..,but they aren't quite on the printed menu yet.  Anyway, we went there tonight and tried a cheeseburger with roasted onions and it was very, very good...high quality ingredients and that coal oven flavoring made for a delicious hamburger at a pizza place!  With the burger came a side of fingerling potato wedges in a buttery garlic sauce and these were AMAZINGLY GOOD...we advised the manager they were SO GOOD they should be a stand-alone appetizer item.  We really enjoy the dining experience here...great food & great service at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Good food, a bit pricey.....Seems like it take a long time for food to come out....I do love the garlic roll things though!"}
{"text":"Tried it today for the first time and went around noon. Not too many people inside so I ate at the bar. The bar tender recommended wings and pizzetta. They were both delicious. I ordered my wings crispy and well done. The Italian style kind and they came out perfect."}
{"text":"Great Pizza!  Amazing Roasted wings and service was on point.  We'll be getting our pizza from here a lot more often."}
{"text":"We came here with a large group and we each ordered an appetizer. The salads were large enough for 4 people to share. We also split the meatball appetizer and the peppers and sausage, both were excellent! All of the pizza was amazing and the roasted wings were good too. Several people shared the chocolate cannolis and chocolate shortcake, perfect end to a great dinner."}
{"text":"The pizza is  bit pricey but excellent, and the garlic knots are super. Staff are pretty good. Service is a little slow but that is probably because it's a new place and really busy plus all new staff . I hope the place continues to provide great food because it's wonderful to have a good restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"So glad we decided to try this place.  Just moved to the area and always looking for a good place to go.  They do half off any pizza on Tuesday and half off wings on Thursdays.     The ONLY reason I didn't give 5 stars is because we sort of waited about 20-30 minutes to get our pizza BUT the manager, Kimberly, was great and took care of us.    We had the bruschetta...probably one of the best I've ever had!  The wings were ok.  The flavor was good but didn't like chewy skin.  The pizza was delicious!!  We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I have recently found this pizza place. We have eaten  here 4 times in 2 months. The brick oven pizza is very good as is the calzone.  The service has been a little hit and miss. As an example tonight we arrived 2 minutes after happy hour. We were seated and then proceeded to wait 14 minutes to be addressed by a server. He approached the table and asked if we had been waiting long?  I advised yes, 14 minutes. He replied oh wow well my name is gage and I will be taking care of you.  No apology, no manager, no concern for the inconvenience. I could understand possibly if the restaurant was busy but they were not.  Good food disappointing service."}
{"text":"Ate there today for the first time. Reasonably price, with good service and decent food. I imagine that we will be going back."}
{"text":"Cheers - !!!!!!!!!! great pies here !!!!!!!!!!!!  The Pizzas- absolutely Super tasty, fresh ingredients, robust flavors, the sauce was just right!  Great pizza will be ordering again this is a Adult pizza... Not so much for the kiddos  Best Veggie Pizza any of us had in recollection... It was gone so fast!  The Pepperoni & Sausage - I loved it.  Not kiddo safe ... the cheese was under the pepperoni and the toppings fell off for the kids. 'Eh what-ya gonna do huh?!'  Price is higher but worthy of a quality Pie!  Cheers - KSoderberg"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service and helpful managers! So happy we have this local place!"}
{"text":"Great food but EXPENSIVE. Probably the best pizza in Chandler, similar to California Kitchen in style. Fun sports bar atmosphere and very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive wait staff. Two pies, two beers and one meatball appetizer came to $70 including tip."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our first visit here. Right when you walk in your nose says yummy. We ordered the ceasar salad and that was excellent, the onion and garlic wings were decent but I wouldn't order them again. We also are the Capo pizza which was excellent. Very thin crust with excellent fresh ingredients. The charcoal oven really adds some great flavor the the food. I would recommend this to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as I've heard and read good things, that's where the good part of the story ends.  When I arrived I watched the pizza being made with all the precision of a machine, perhaps they should use a machine, exactly this much dough; no more, no less, exactly this much cheese; no more, no less, exactly x number pieces of paper thin pepperoni; no more, no less, x number leaves of basil; no more, no less, obviously they are very concerned about the per unit cost, who cares about the taste or look.  The dough was like a cracker no give at the edges overcooked in their 1000 degree coal oven and it was pricey at that.  Staff was pleasant and courteous which doesn't make up for an $18 pizza which weighs like almost nothing when you carry it out.  If I was to buy another, which I will not, I would weigh it when I got home, you sure don't need 2 hands to carry it like large homemade style pizza.  I threw out the leftovers which is a mortal sin for an Italian but I couldn't bare to eat it again.  If you want a pizza in this area, try Basha's they're not great but they're half the price, and they use a gas fired brick oven."}
{"text":"I have had much better food and for less $ .I ordered 2 calzone with Ricotta cheese and pepperoni came with  soo little riccota and only 5 pieces pepperoni cost $25.00 I will never go back . That's ridiculous they are expensive and not worthy or the pricing. They are near my house and I will travel to any other restaurant before them."}
{"text":"Extremely full is what I am after dinner here.  I mean I totally should not have shoved that last piece of pizza into my face.  It was just so good.  I only stopped there because it became apparent that I would literally vomit like Mr Creosote if i so much as tasted a wafer thin mint.  So I'm miserable, yet happy at the same time.  I had the Caprese Salad, a couple of garlic knots (you MUST order these), and a pizza with cheese, basil, and sun dried tomatoes.  I could only manage half my eight inch pizza after all the other stuff I wolfed down, but still ate another slice.  Just for good measure.  Happy hour is the time to come, with awesome deals on the appetizers and such.  Its super loud, so you can't really carry on a conversation.  But who talks while shoving pizza in your face anyway? That's just rude.  I don't drink so I can't really speak about the bar.  The guy at the next table had an appropriately dirty looking martini, though.  In the hit and miss world of pizza, this is a hit, a very palpable hit. I shall return."}
{"text":"The food is good, but portions are quite small for their prices. Pizza sizes are on the smaller size, so order one size up. They are also very thin, so maybe double the order .  But, I will say their customer service was top notch!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and the food is pretty good. I would like to give it 3.5 stars, but that is not an option. The dough of the pizza is excellent. Probably one of my favorites that I've ever had. Chewy, with a crispy outside and the flavor is very appeasing. The toppings(cheese and pepperoni are all we've tried thus far) are good quality as well.  We have tried the caeser which we did NOT like the dressing(some of my favorite caeser dressings as a point of reference are red lobster's & fazzoli's). We had the antipasto salad which the dressing was decent, super tangy, and again, not the best thing on the menu. The one thing we really enjoyed about the salad was the meat and cheese rolls in it. See pics to see what I'm talking about. We had Buffalo wings, which are meaty, moist, and have a good flavor, lots of pepper(and they have \"good\" ranch...not the weird thick packet kind). The spinach artichoke dip was good. It had hot and cold(temperature) spots which was strange, but I did not prefer the \"crusty bread\" they serve with it because they put cheese on it. I do not like baked or hardened cheese on bread. However, they give an adequate amount of bread for dipping, so you're not left with dip and no way to eat it without literally spoon eating it. And what meal would be complete without a cookie sundae! Doughy hot cookie with ice cream on top? Yes please! It was delicious and went super fast between 5 of us. I had to stop my almost 3 year old from licking the \"skillet\"(it was still hot from the oven).   This place is definitely worth checking out if you are a crust snob or want some good wings and dessert."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite pizza place.  The flavors were so fresh. The pizza dough was great.   I got the chicken bruschetta pizza and will definitely order it again!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Great crust. It taste great even the next day. Very nice ambiance."}
{"text":"I want to love this place. It's walking distance from my house. But each time I'm sadly underwhelmed. Normally I would never write a review if it isn't a good one (If I don't have anything nice to say...), but this one I feel I should write.   Server was polite, atmosphere was good, Restaurant looked clean from my view.   But, we ordered the garlic bread (can't remember exact name but kind of like garlic knots). They had very little flavor.   We also ordered 12 wings. We received 11, (I know, first world problems but we were splitting them and i wasn't trying to have one less )... and one of them looked to have a hair on it. We brought this to the servers attention. She brought us 2 fresh ones. A temperature check in from the management would have been appreciated here. A discount wasn't necessary but probably would have made me not write this review.   We still try again since it's too close not to, hoping to update this review with more stars!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Decent prices. Nothing to write home about. They are trying to be a little more upscale than they really are in my opinion, but overall they are doing a pretty good job and we're glad to have them in the community."}
{"text":"Completely terrible service! From staff and the manager Kim. The server forgot to place our order. Forty-five minutes after placing our order we were told it would be an additional 20 minutes to get it. We were brought the incorrect pizza. Nothing compared to the service I have experienced at Tony Sacco's in Michigan. I wish I could talk to the actual franchise owner!  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Originally stopped across the street for dinner and our party of 4 was greeted very poorly and told the wait was 30 minutes even though there was no one else waiting and tables were obviously open. Decided to head to Tony's and we were immediately greeted with no wait. Delicious food, great atmosphere and friendly service! We'll be back time and time again."}
{"text":"Having driven by this place many times in the last couple of weeks and seeing the Edison Lights I thought it might be worth a try.   I should also add I'm not a sucker for ambiance. I've had many a good meal in places where you see the occasional roach on the table or would rather use a portapotty than their washroom.   It was around 9PM on a Saturday night so we were seated right away. Our waiter promptly took our drink order.   Someone told me they heard the wings were good so we ordered some. We also ordered a Pepperoni, Mushroom and Kalamata Olive pizza.  We overheard one of the other waiters tell his table that this place has no freezers, microwaves or fryers.  They need a fryer.  The wings while plump and juicy were like they had been cooked in a microwave. The skin was rubbery and none of the fat was rendered.  When the pizza came we had our wing plates ready to be taken away. Not this time. The waiter had other things on his mind. And he didn't notice that more than half the wings were still untouched.  OK, the pizza. It's not Grimaldi's, Rosati's or even Casanova Brothers.   Grimaldi's has the natural casing pepperoni that crisps, cups and is really greasy. That's a good thing by the way. It also has fresh Mozzarella and the sauce is not really sauce but fresh tomato crushed on top of the cheese. I think Grimaldi's is far better.  Rosati's is better also but in a different way.  The pizza was better than Domino's, Little Caesar or Papa John's. The crust was thin and crispy with a nice crust. The sauce was ok as well as the toppings but, the toppings were sparse. All except the cheese. Actually too much cheese is not a good thing in my eyes. The amount of cheese was a bit much. Not way to much. Amalfi has way too much cheese. This place is better than Amalfi.    Did I say that after we had eaten half our pizza, had our drinks refilled twice, the dirty plates from the wings were still there. We had them stacked so they would be easy to take. Four other workers had walked by our table and not a single one noticed.   We had two pieces of pizza left and the waiter asked if we wanted them boxed up. He also asked if we wanted the wings boxed and we told him that they weren't that good. He mentioned that the table behind us had the same comment. Still didn't take the plates.   The manager came over and said that he checked our wings and we were right. They should have been cooked longer. He also took them off the check.   We also had a conversation about the lighting. While the Edison Lights are nice all the spot lights make it brighter that a night game at Wrigley Field. He said they were working on that.   There is a pizza close buy that's just as good. The Basha's next door. They have a brick oven. They use the same cheese and pepperoni. It's also only $10 bucks for a large. Not twenty.   I have had far worse and I have had much better. It's not bad but it's not somewhere I would go back to unless I didn't want to drive the extra few miles to Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Fantastic baked wings! Awesome beer served by Bree who's super friendly, and very customer focused. This is a can't miss!"}
{"text":"Great staff, great food and reasonable prices.  Always well taken care of when you are a customer here.  Mike the owner always on site. Jess the manager keeps things moving along and the fact everything is made in a pizza oven means no fried food. Yay!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place to go for family night or even for happy hour!! The staff is great and the food is fantastic!! If you are a blue cheese fan....you have found the best made from scratch!!! The wings are baked not fried and yet crispy!!! So good!!!!"}
{"text":"Great first experience...friendly staff, fast service, amazing, fresh food. We ordered the Napoli pizza, based on our waiter's fave  (outstanding recommendation) and Garlic Knots as an app, which were yummy, but could have used more garlic. Only recommendation would be a better beer selection (more local, craft). Other than that, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza and a dozen wings for pick-up.  Upon arriving, the door was opened for me and I was greeted by two kind employees. I was directed to the back to pick up my order.  I was then greeted by another employee.  Everyone was very nice!  The pizza was very good and the buffalo wings were baked and very tasty as well.  Much better than any other pizza place in our area.  Will definitely go again.  Maybe dine in next time."}
{"text":"We had a great experience having our 9-year-old's birthday party here.   I was a little worried due to some of the negative reviews so we tried it out beforehand.   The food tasted great and the cheese pizza was a hit with the 9-year old.  (I think this might be the best pizza I've ever had was what he said).   On the day of the party they allowed us to bring in an outside cake and set up the pizzas and salads we ordered buffet style for us.   The servers were attentive and provided everything we needed.   We were probably a little messier than the average party due to all the kids but I didn't hear any complaints from them.  I was surprised both times we went that they were fairly empty as both the food and service seemed great to me.   I would do it again for sure.  Thank you ToScany's for accommodating us!"}
{"text":"Pretty good  food ice cold beer would definitely recommend to other people and friends great place to watch a game and get food and beers."}
{"text":"Our first dining experience will unfortunately be our last!  We arrived at 5:25pm, seated, & then the experience went downhill!  We ordered an order of garlic rolls & it took 30 min with our waiter, Mike checking 3 times to see if they were ready!  We ordered 2 - 14\" pizzas & a calzone & it took over an hr to get them, again with Mike checking more than once.  When my husband asked Mike if there was a reason why it was taking so long, Mike's reply was that it was the first week they were opened & that we should have come earlier than 6:00pm.  When my husband said we got there before 5:30, Mike shrugged his shoulders & said \"well maybe you shouldn't come back!\"  We have never had a server speak to either one of us like that & that only makes us feel like our business is really not warranted or that important!  Coming from NY where restaurants are always super busy & having worked in the restaurant industry, this kind of treatment & speed of service are two things that will quickly make one's business a goner, something a business in today's economy really has to be so careful of!  Totally a thumb's down experience & a waste of a Saturday night!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted pizza tonight and to give this place a try.  We shared a small salad and a midsummer pizza.  Everything was very tasty and the crust was perfect.  If you ever want a good pizza, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Love this place! The pizza is really good; our favorite is the Greek. Good ambiance and half of on Tuesdays! Decent wine and beer selection."}
{"text":"Rude almost hostile environment, did not even wait for the food, got up and left, will never ever go back, I would normally hope a new local business does well but not this time."}
{"text":"Pizza is the thing to order here , everything else is just mainstream stuff nothing extraordinary. Service is usually slow!!! My kids and wife are here when nothing else to eat at home"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok.  It was just too loud and took forever to get served.  Had to ask for drinks multiple times.  Too busy/loud to enjoy food."}
{"text":"6 of us went Saturday just before 6pm, trying to beat the dinner crowd. We had attempted to eat here on 2 previous occasions, but didn't have time for a wait. They do have a nifty wait-list system that texts you your approximate wait time and how many others are in front of you. There was a line when we left.  We were very pleased. The restaurant is well decorated and our service from the time the hostess opened the door for us until they held the door open on the way out was efficient and friendly. Our waiter was attentive but not intrusive and the manager was making rounds talking to customers.  We ordered a Garlic Rotolis, a Lg. Pepperoni Classico, Sm. Capo and a Cheese Pizetta, plus a Caesar Salad. The pizza was really good, reminding me of \"John's of Times Square\" with a thin crust, crisp but with enough chew. The rotolis are fantastic and salad was a typical Caesar, but a good one.  Finally, if you like ranch dressing on your pizza or rotolis, they make a good ranch. Anyone from Albuquerque who understands the ranch from Dion's will appreciate this.  As for the price, yup, it is more expensive than the surrounding take-out/delivery places, and worth it.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hummus is good and the meatball appetizer is as well, but the happy hour menu and prices are not all that. Drinks are pretty expensive for a local pizza joint...it's not some high end Craft establishment. Head someplace else if you want better drinks and food."}
{"text":"The food here is very good. Honestly, I haven't had anything I didn't like. Service is pretty good, bar is well stocked, and the place is almost never crowded. The bread is awesome, so the chicken-parm sandwich is epic. Make sure to tell the bartender to go light on the ice."}
{"text":"We came back and we had a nice Caesar salad and sausage and mushroom pizza.  Good service and good beer selection for my husband.  It's a decent choice for a neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  yummy food. Excellent wings and salad! Very nice servers.   Glad to have this local neighborhood establishment!"}
{"text":"Morgan was our server today... Today was our second visit after the first being terrible!! Today was awesome food but the service was just as awful as the first time unfortunately. She took way too long to get us our drink and food orders and seemed to \"forget\" us  She brought us the wrong pizza and comped us for it but then had to wait for the original correct pizza. She wasn't very apologetic for her mistake and instead (she later gave us the wrong pizza free) just kept saying our pizza was coming up. When she does get our food I had tried get her attention very loudly bc she couldn't hear us to get us refills only to be brought a drink with a bug in it, I had a 10% coupon for yelp and they didn't comp anything further for the bug , mistake or overall lack of service ; AWFUL   Totally disappointed and won't be back again!!! Totally wasted the $85.62, don't waste your money!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. Everything about it was great! We had sausage and peppers app, wings and capo pizza. We sat at the bar. Drinks were good. Service was amazing! I will be back! So happy to see such a good local place!"}
{"text":"Rough start due to coupon confusion! Manager made it right and we loved the thin crust pizza and house salad! Finally a gourmet pizza restaurant in the hood!"}
{"text":"We ordered wings pizza and beer. They place the pie on one of those pizza stances to save room on the table. It had more slices on one side than another and my wife took a slice and The rest flopped to the floor. The waiter was great he talked to manager and she had made us a fresh new pizza to take home with us.  The service was great. !! Glad to have a local pizza joint by our house. :)!!"}
{"text":"I struggle with this place. The food is consistent, tasty, reasonably priced with great weekly specials and happy hours...BUT the service has been sub par every time I've been there. Doesn't matter if it's busy or completely dead--my water cup sits empty or the table is left completely alone/forgotten until we flag someone down. Twice now we've had to ask the host if we had a server after waiting ~10 minutes once seated.  We've sat at the bar a couple times, which was better. But the last time we went, the guy behind the bar was too busy talking to his friends and sipping on a margarita to even greet us and say the other bartender would be with us soon.  It's not enough that I want to forego going completely (especially since my in laws like it), but the tip certainly suffers as a result."}
{"text":"Horrible overpriced sub-par food. All undercooked pizza and calzones. Terrible live music. Don't waste your time. Pleasant and courteous server though. Travel to the closest Grimaldi's. Totally worth the drive."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Nice place. Pizza is good. Wings are very good. Their prices seem reasonable. Will go back often"}
{"text":"Love coming here on Tuesdays for half off pizzas. Food is great and kids love it,too!"}
{"text":"The hummus appetizer was excellent. The wings are very good and half price wings on Tuesday is awesome! The pizza is just the way I like it...thin crust and coal fired. Thursday is half off pizzas and is a great deal. You will not be disappointed. The service is sometimes slower when there is a crowd but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went here on their 1/2 price pizza Thursday's. Got here at 5:30 and they were busy!!  1/2 off appetizers for happy hour--   Had the caprese salad... It was good .. Lots of basil!  Also ordered their wood fired wings- 6 Italian and 6 buffalo. Like the crisp of the wings however the flavor was not there.   :(  Now the pizza-- is gourmet without being too fancy. The crust is thin and crunchy.. Mmmmmm. Sauce is light but tasty.   Did not order the meatballs this time but they are the way to go!!    Doin it right Tony Sacco!!"}
{"text":"Nice looking clean place, service was good, but pizza was just ok ... sad because we were looking for a great pizza. barros has better pizza then this .."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before and the food is not terrible and pizza is good.  However, on this trip we ordered a specialty pizza (think it was called the Napoli) and had to send it back. The meat topping on the pizza had BONE in it (my wife found out the hard way by biting into it while eating the first slice) and the waiter offered to make a new one (without meat this time at our request), but the manager didn't even come over to apologize or refund any portion of the meal.  The waiter gave it to the manager who he said confirmed it WAS BONE in the meat.  GROSS meat and not very good customer service from management.  Sad because this was a good back-up place for us until this visit.  Guess I'll be throwing away those coupons I purchased for this restaurant.  It would have been a lot different if a manager actually came to apologize...guess that is why this place is so dead every time I have been there."}
{"text":"I don't know... For a short time, I thought I had found a NY Style pizza place that we desperately needed in this area.  I was wrong.  Tonight I ordered a 16\" pizza w/ 2 toppings and 8 wings \"crispy\".  $28.95 later... I brought home a horrible experience.  The pizza was average at best, the wings soggy and nowhere near crispy.  Too many kids working.  The product is inconsistent.  Was there a several weeks ago and it was better than this time, but not great.  Seems to me, the kids are more interested in whether or not you are going to tip them for bringing you your take out order.  Where I come from, the best pizza is made by the owner of the restaurant and maybe a son or cousin.  In this place, its a production line of kids, with one more clueless than the next.  You can't provide a quality product with that type of inconsistency.  I usually speak with my wallet.  I'm not afraid of the cost... but with this quality, I would try something else.  I personally think that Gilbert Pizza is closer to what I would consider a NY Style pizza.  If you go there, you will notice the owner almost always present in the kitchen!  Many will find Tony Sacco's good, and I respect that.  I think it is a huge disappointment!"}
{"text":"We have visited twice now.  Time to write the review!  The first visit we ordered pizza.  It was fine.  Nothing spectacular, but it was good.  I'd probably give it 3 stars.  This visit was for lunch.  We ordered (and split) the sausage and peppers appetizer, and the chicken Parmesan entree.  The sausage was good, but the peppers didn't taste fresh.  In fact, they tasted \"old\".  My wife, who is a serious veggie eater, wouldn't eat them.  I had some but covered the taste with marinara.  The chicken was moist but not flavorful.  So they cooked it properly, but didn't season it noticeably.  The pasta was overcooked a bit and only warm.  It should have been hot (if it were fresh) and \"al dente\".  We both agreed that it seems likely the pasta had been sitting around a while, so it had continued cooking from residual heat becoming softer, and of course was becoming cooler as it sat.  Service was good, and the marinara sauce was tasty.  Those were probably the high-points of this latest visit.  There are too many other options out there to settle for this quality level.  Definitely \"I've experienced better\"."}
{"text":"got a coupon for this place and figured why not check it out. The restaurant itself looks nice, clean, very appealing.  As far as the food goes it was ok.  We tried the garlic roll things and you could tell they had been sitting for a while.. not much flavor, not really warm, served with cold marinara sauce.  The italian chicken wings weren't bad.  As far as the pizza goes, it was decent.  If you're a fan of Grimaldi's it's the samy type, but not nearly as good. Will we be back? Probably not, unless we get another coupon."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times with my husband since it opened a few months ago. Have done carry out as well as dine in. Pizza is pretty good and the garlic knots and garlic onion wings were great. Nice atmosphere and a great addition to SE Chandler. Nice deals during the late evening happy hour as well."}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch with my wife and grand daughter. The pepperoni special pizza was delicious. The service was attentive and friendly. The waiter who was also covering the bar was very helpful but I can't remember his name. The Caesar salad was very fresh and tasty. We will definitely be back soon for dinner."}
{"text":"Although its a 47 mile one-way trip from Glendale, my wife and I decided to try Tony Sacco's today. It was easy-enough to find and the restaurant is furnished nicely, like any other sports bar. I hear the place was founded by two guys from Michigan, and I'm from Michigan and I was in the mood for something different.  We ordered a Margherita pizza, half-dozen wings and my wife ordered the Pollo Di Forno (chicken sandwich).  The food arrived promptly, though the wings arrived after everything else, which was odd. The pizza is very thin, so it gets cold very quickly. The crust is light, the sauce is light, the basil is shredded (wish they used whole basil leaves instead). Overall, the pizza is bland, with the only flavor coming from the basil. I think the pizza should have been cooked longer and had more sauce (and I'm not a huge fan of a lot of sauce on a pizza, but this was very bland.) It tasted fresh, but there just wasn't much flavor to it.  Since there are no fryers in the restaurant, I was hesitant to try the chicken wings. In my opinion, chicken wings should be fried crispy. But the picture on the menu made them look so good, I thought I would try them. I'm glad I did. They serve them with tongs on a fancy plate, which is unnecessary. They also come with some cut celery. There were 6 wings and 5 pieces of celery. Too many places that serve wings no longer serve celery with the wings, so I was delighted to have celery with my wings!  The wings have a light coating on them and the 'hot' sauce is built into that coating. Therefore, the wings are not served in a puddle, but sit rather dry on the plate. I find this appealing. The wings had a good flavor, but they would have been amazing if they were fried.  The Pollo Di Forno was good, but again very bland. They could've used more pesto in the mayo. The pasta salad it came with was very good.  They serve Coke products. Yay!  The manager stopped by our table to check if everything was okay. That's a nice touch.  The menu offers calzones that are NOT made with ricotta cheese. This is the first restaurant I've been to in more than 20 years that makes calzones this way. Many restaurants that serve calzones won't even make them without ricotta. I can get a calzone from Babbo made without ricotta as a special order, but its one of the few places that offers that option. I'll definitely have to come back some time to try the calzone and to try a good ole fashioned pepperoni pizza.   The total cost of our order was $36.  Over all, the atmosphere and menu options and prices were all to be expected for this style of restaurant. If they were more centrally located, I'd definitely eat here again. However, driving 47 miles for something that was just 'good' and not 'awesome' isn't worth it.  If they open a location on the west side or even central Phoenix, I would go mildly out of my way to eat there when it was convenient. But for now, I don't anticipate going back any time soon. My overall conclusion is this place is more about their location than it is about their food. If I lived close by, it would make sense to eat here. Decent food at decent prices. But its not some place for special occasions or to treat yourself to something special. There is, sadly, nothing special about it. But also, nothing horrible about it, either."}
{"text":"Little pricey for getting full....but perfect pricing for deliciousness.  This is gourmet pizza.  We had the napoli.  Fresh basil and ricotta made it amazong.  The GM stopped by our table for feedback.  Good service.  This is family friendly.  All in all a great value.  No reason not to give a 5. star.   Reference for rating, I would rate Barros 2, pizza hut 3, dominoes 1 , Rosatis 4, Grimaldies 5, rush street 3"}
{"text":"Ordered take out tonight and there is parking right up front for to-go.  I would have to say when I looked at the pizza I was a bit bummed but it turned out to be one of the best pies I've had in a while.  The ingredient were flavorful and generous with the toppings.  They I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"From hero to zero!  Not only has their pizza quality gone in the toilet but the way they charge is even worse.   If you order a half and half pizza the cost is ridiculous. Every topping is charged individually as if it was a whole LARGE pizza!   This was on a small pizza!  The pepperoni half had a few mini cheap ass pieces on each slice. I didn't want to buy the place, just grab a quick takeout dinner.  BTW I guess you have to specify you want cheese on your pizza because there were no signs of cheese on the doughy limp tasteless crust. (I ordered it extra crispy and live less than 3 minutes away). With the number of pizza joints around, drive 4 minutes more to get a quality, fair priced, digestible, cheese and topping filled pie.  There is a reason they have shortened their hours.   I suggest being closed 24/7.  Sadly Peter Piper Frozen Pizza is comparable to the expensive trash ToScanys is serving."}
{"text":"Have ordered take out a couple times. Being from NY their pizza is so so. I was a big fan of their antipasto salad though. Decided to dine in a few nights ago and I have to say I was extremely disappointed. Service was horrible. I have managed restaurants so I am usually very understanding but this was just bad. I'll just mention a few gems...no silverware on table even after food was delivered. We waited at least 15 minutes before we got any. Food came out at all different times. Specific prep requests were ignored. There was a woman (who I assume may have been an owner because she definitely did not look like a working manager) who had her hair down and was wearing high heels who was serving shots and other drinks to tables around us. She looked over at our table a few times and blatantly ignored us. Not a good experience at all. Will not return to dine in that's for sure."}
{"text":"Love Tony's for pizza, but I do recommend dining in much more than take out.  The prices are good and the pies are delicious.  They have a decent menu that also includes some great appetizers such as a hummus plater and meatballs.  They have a nice bar and several interesting local draft selections.  Never seems to get too busy and they tolerate my crazy kids just fine.  There is also an outdoor patio that is great in the winter!"}
{"text":"The Chicken Pesto pizza is soooo good. One of my two favorite pizza places in Chandler"}
{"text":"I very rarely, actually have never, given 5 stars.  All the staff were very friendly and they seated our party of 12 as soon as we walked in.  The service was excellent and the owner even took time to come to our table and chat. We loved everything we tried. The meatball app, sausage & peppers and chicken wings were my personal favorites. I didn't personally try the pizza, but the other 11 people at the table loved theirs. The place is a cool looking, comfortable place to hang out with great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant with amazing happy hour (and reverse happy hour) prices. Their pizzas are great but their lasagna with garlic knots is even better. Owner is always around and really friendly as well which is always a good sign. The bar is always packed with friendly locals which is a great option for peeps looking for a good meal, good wine, and good convo when dining alone."}
{"text":"Met a business associate for lunch, we both had different 14\" pizzas & they were amazing! Great service, awesome food & clean place to dine!"}
{"text":"This pizza is excellent!  It's good quality pizza, not the cheap stuff around the area!  Nice place, too!!"}
{"text":"After reading other peoples negative reviews I was thinking \"Wow, some people are very picky about their pizza!\"  Well, I guess I am one of those people because this pizza was awful.  We ordered a Margherita and it was just not good.  Burnt spots on the bottom, barely no cheese, a tasteless tomato sauce, and it was super thin and bendy.  I tried folding it in half but then the first thing I tasted was the burnt stuff on the bottom.  We also got the garlic rotolis.  No where near as good as the garlic knots I've eaten at a dozen other pizza joints.  They tasted like they were made from canned Pillsbury dough and there was hardly and seasoning on them.  The Bruschetta was decent tasting, but hard to eat because the bread was really soft and when you attempted to pick up a piece it folded inwards and all the tomato topping and the tons of excess juice just squished out all over.  It was like Italian Sushi because you have to cram the whole entire thing in your mouth at one time.  The one thing that kept me from giving this place one star were the wings.  I myself did not eat any buy the guys LOVED them.  They're oven baked in that 1000 degree coal oven.  Burns pizza but makes great wings I guess.  Anyway, I probably won't go back but the BF and his buddy will probably find their way over there for the wings again."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza last night.  Had the Greek pizza-it was great!  Thin crust, lots of toppings.  Hummus appetizer and garlic rotolis were amazing.  Full of flavor."}
{"text":"Tried it on a Friday Night. Hostess sat us down and said\" Were a 100% natural, not like McDonald's were they throw the whole chicken and head into a blender and that's there chicken.\" My wife and me looked at each other is shock! Ordered a Aloha pizza and antipasti salad. Pizza was like eating cardboard and you can get a better salad at Costco's food court. Mike the server never showed up after the pizza and we sat and waited and waited for the check. Manager came by and asked, \" How was everything?\" We told her of the events and she picked up the tab. Service 1, Food 1. Wouldn't waste my money again going here!"}
{"text":"Great wood fired pizza!!! YUMMY, delicious grilled wings!!! The pizza is the best around. The service has been mostly wonderful. Bar service is great too! Usually little to no wait time unless you go on Tuesdays when they have 1/2 off pizza when you eat in!"}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Very good brick oven pizza & very fast. Our service was great,  just like the pizza. Check out restaurant.com for coupons"}
{"text":"I have ordered a couple of times from here.  I initially liked the flavor of the pizza.  However having doordash as the only option for delivery really sucks.  The pizza always arrives stone cold and really not edible.   So after waiting 45 minutes for it to arrive from doordash, we then have to put the pizza in the oven.  Not only to get the pizza hot but also to finish cooking it, as it seems the center is always undercooked.  Pretty disappointing that this place doesn't have their own delivery driver.  It's not like the pizza is cheap, they should be able to provide their own delivery.  Otherwise they should remove their name from doordash."}
{"text":"Way understaffed for a Sunday game day with TVs. Brie was really nice and took care of us and the entire bar.  Wings had good flavor but were really fatty.  Pizza was really good but took forever.  Overall was good but  just really needed additional employees!"}
{"text":"We went there on a Tuesday afternoon, the staff was very attentive and nice. We started with the bruschetta and the meatballs, both were very fresh and very tasty, followed by a large Greek pizza. The crust and the pizza toppings  are the best I have had in a very long time, we will be back.  pm"}
{"text":"We went during the initial opening and said we would not return due to service and food not being up to our expectations for the price. Of course we went back several months and things were much different. Service was very good. Maybe too good. The bartender told us the wings were really good. MISTAKE... they are outstanding. I do not ever need to eat a fried wing again. The wings are made in the oven and come with roasted garlic and onions. They are truly the best wings ever and not greasy.   Pizza is good also. I recommend the vegi with a meat. Their vegis are very good but a pizza needs meat for me.   We have not taken another shot at a sandwich after the first visit so I will withhold comment until we try it again.  Not cheap. You are paying for quality but it is rather pricy. There are other pizza places close that are not as good but much less price.   Inside is very nice and good atmosphere with plenty of TVs."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good calzone, friendly service. Others at my table likes their pizza. Was there on a Sunday and it wasn't overly busy but was steady."}
{"text":"Wow, really good food. We have been 5 or 6 times now, each visit has been great. The pizza is super, we have also tried the wings (Italian) are the best, the salads are tops and always fresh. Oh, good cold beer, too. Anyone saying this isn't a great place, must own a nearby pizza place and they are missing their customers. We are all at Tony's!!!"}
{"text":"We showed up at 9:50 on a Friday night to have dinner after a football game. The posted hours say they are open until 11:00. We walked in and waited to be seated. We were told they just closed. I said it says you are open until 11:00. I was told \"Sorry\", we decided to close at 10:00 today. We won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Good wood fired pizza cooked just as you like it. Carry out staff is always friendly & gives us packets of cheese & peppers. When we dine in we try to sit in the bar area lots of locals watching sports which makes for a fun time while enjoying a cold beer."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good, caprese appetizer was decent, and the white cake desert was okay.  The prices are right but the service was too slow.  We were hoping it would all be great as it's very close to where we live but unfortunately it won't be our goto spot."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for dinner, and I have to say that it was an overall enjoyable experience.  We sat at the bar, and thankfully it wasn't too busy. Ricky was our bartender for the evening.  Being the first time here, I wasn't sure how big the pizza was but we went for the large Capo. We were not disappointed! The crust was just thick enough but still crunchy. We also had the wings and they were some of the most delicious wings I've had in a long time!  To end the night, we had the canoli for dessert.  All in all, great food, great service from Ricky, and great laid back, enjoyable atmosphere.  Will come back again!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing, thank you Josh! The food was delish! We will definitely be back. It's about time we had a really good pizza place and bar in southeast Chandler. Loved the thin crust pizza and the baked wings were a must. We will be back...soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza places in the valley. There crust always comes out perfect my kids love it!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Dined in once and a few weeks later got a carry out order, both pizzas were excellent, most recently had the Napoli and bbq wings.  When we dined in we ordered a half bianco and half cheese since we had our kids, 5 and 3 with us. When the pizza came out it was a full bianco but the waitress said she noticed the issue, apologized and already had the kitchen start a new cheese pizza which came out a short time later. This was excellent service by fixing the problem and not waiting for us to bring it to her attention.    I will definitely be back for a third visit"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout capo pizza and salad and it was great.  Had to call several times to place the takeout order because no one answered and I kept getting a recording that kept saying \"no voicemail was set up\".  I kept calling and finally got ahold of someone."}
{"text":"Great pizza , delicious drinks, awesome draft selection, yummy appetizers...what's not to love?!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch here on whim with my wife and son. Seemed slow for afternoon so not sure how service is when busy but we were greeted by friendly staff, seated right away, food came out fast, hot and delicious! We'll be making this a neighborhood regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Love the wings, sandwiches and pizza.  Good family environment.    Love the garlic rotoli's and can't go wrong with the specialty drinks.    Blueberry smash tonight is hitting the spot!"}
{"text":"This place was such a pleasant surprise. The food was delicious! They have the most delicious meatballs, the pizza was perfect and the roasted wings were mouth watering. To top it off- the service was great too. We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Some of the lettuce had brown edges and the croutons were stale not crunchy at all (thanks mgt and waiter for taking the salad off the bill) Service was good. Wings (6) and a Caesar salad. The wings weren't bad. Could have a little stronger flavor had the Italian flavor. Cooked well, liked that they were naked.  While the salad was taken off the bill and as minor as it was it would've been a good thing for a manager to stop by.  Just a tip: get rid of the Buffett during the week do a limited selection; i.e.: 1 slice (oversized) and a salad and a drink for fast service and let the business people know in the area. The Saturday buffets for the Saturday shoppers etc."}
{"text":"We were so excited to eat at ToScany's after my inlaws said what a great experience they have had on multiple occasions for happy hour  I'm sorry to say - we had quite the opposite.....such a disappointment since when we walked into the restaurant it did smell like an Italian Grandma's home  1. Caesar Salad - way over dressed....tasted like cheap kraft parmesan cheese pretty much inedible 2. Garlic knots - were cold, drenched in olive oil, barely tasted of garlic and tasted stale...really? you're a pizza place - they should be pipping hot and made to order 3. Sausage and Peppers - completely overcooked 4. Meatballs - unimpressive  the only thing this place has going for it is you could potential get out of there for $10 during HH (less than some fast food places now a days.....)"}
{"text":"Excellent service!!! I had the Italian wings and they were sooo good! Not to mention they are baked and not fried so that's cool. I wish they had a gluten free pizza because I would come in more often. Nicholas was an AMAZING server and really funny. Best one here . And he always keeps your drinks full!"}
{"text":"We have tried Toscanys twice and if the first time was like todays experience, I wouldn't have gone back for the 2nd time.  Salads were overpriced for the size and the pizzas were very bland.  I paid over $60 which doesn't seem like much but for what we got, I definitely overpaid.  Food was also prepared too early, based on my requested pick up time as the pizza's were barely warm.  Wouldn't go back, despite the convenient location.  Overpriced and food tasted very Bleh (:"}
{"text":"If I had written my review when we first dined at this restaurant I would have given them 5 stars. It has gone down hill since then. The busier they got, the lack of taste went into their pizzas! Even the service went down hill. My favorite pizza on their menu was Capo. I'm not sure if they changed their sausage vendor but it is now disgusting.   You know business has changed when they start offering half off pizzas or lunch buffets."}
{"text":"Wow!  I am impressed.  I just got back from an amazing dinner at Tony Sacco's.  We were a large group and got to try a lot of things.  EVERYTHING was delicious.  I don't remember the last restaurant I went to that I liked everything.  The hummus was to amazing.  The meatballs made me lose track of the conversation and I have never like meatballs before.  The wings are baked in an oven that is 1000 degrees (I think that is what the server said).  No frying, but delicious, spectacular wings.  Everything was fresh.  The pizza is thin crust and the toppings of the three types I tried were a perfect blend.  I am sorry I don't remember the names of the pizzas, but two of them are known as the favorite, so just ask.    The lighting was bright enough to see the party, but dark enough to create a lovely atmosphere.  There was just the right amount of music in the background, and conversation was easy.  An amazing place to go for a dinner for two or for a large group like we were.  I will be going back with my husband first chance we have.  Make sure to save room for the deserts!"}
{"text":"The pizza is also good by it does take a while to get it. Usually a 45 minute wait at peak dinner time. That being said, it is worth the wait. Excellent thin crust and a good flavor. I like a healthy version so I get the Marco Polo without cheese. Great flavor and a healthy choice."}
{"text":"This is a great place in the neighborhood. The food is consistently delicious and fresh. The atmosphere is casual with lots of families. My favorites are the meatball sub, Napoli pizza, and the tiramisu. The staff is friendly and helpful! The bar is nice and has tv's for the sports fan. There are always good specials and a good happy hour. Super glad this place is close by."}
{"text":"We decided to use a coupon and try this new restaurant out.  Even without a coupon, the prices were very reasonable.  The Capo pizza was piping hot, although the ingredients could have been more evenly spread on the pie.  The Antipasto was crisp and cold.  Reminds me of Grimaldi's but much, much cheaper.  For NY pizza, it was excellent --- we are from Chicago (pizza rivals!) and all staff members were friendly and service oriented.  Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Food is never cooked all the way!  Take out service is AWFUL.  Make sure you check the order because I have never received the right order!!!!"}
{"text":"My Fiance and I went to Sacco's on a half off day.. We are new to the area and and wanted to try something new. We were advised that there would be a 30+ minute wait, they ask for your number to call you when your table is ready. I noticed after 15 minutes more people started to arrive and they were being seated before my fiance and I.Moments later a hostess comes outside and ask a new group of individuals if they would like something to drink after she had come out 2 additional times I guess she felt obligated to see if we were thirsty.Now 30 plus minutes later more people are called before us and I was thinking maybe that had reservations...No I go to the hostess and advised her that several people have been seated before us she acted as if she was oblivious to was I was talking about and I asked her to repeat the number that was given...She typed in the wrong number and said that she hadn't called us anyway but of course she didn't because she didn't have the correct number. Finally we were seated BBQ pizza was horrible wings were flavorless and the table was fit for 2 very small people. I have had pizza from around the valley and this was not in the top 10."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and it wasn't too busy. Got seated right away! We got the spinach dip for an appetizer and it was fresh and hot! We also got a make your own pizza and wings. Both were great. The wings are huge! Great food, atmosphere and service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Turned off immediately that (clearly a regular, because she's all chummy with the manager) parks in the \"to go\" parking.  Rules must not apply to her and her two girls.  Or she already knows that no one at the restaurant cares.  Mike B. - thanks so much for your reponse.  You came over to the bar booth (we were seated in the booth next to her) and spoke with her directly (petite woman, hair in ponytail, dressed nicely, drinking multiple martini's, with two young girls).  In fact, many of your staff workers came over to say hi and give hugs.  She knows all of you, but clearly doesn't respect your rules.  Your hosts say this happens often, but they just shrug their shoulders. My husband and I love your place, but we parked in the outskirts of the Bashas parking lot to eat here, and then watch this \"entitled\" woman just park right in front where she shouldn't be.  If I  had ordered \"to go\", and saw that, I would have been even more ticked.  But I appreciate that you will check on it, and you now get 5 stars, because we really love the place!   Mike B. -  I hope you're thinking of the right person.  She was NOT the woman sitting at the bar with her daughter that had long, blonde hair.  The woman I'm speaking of has TWO daughters, both with long, brown hair, ages between 8 and 10 (I'm guessing, because the girls were not facing us).  They were in a booth directly across from the bar.  Just don't want you to confront the wrong person.  However, the woman at the bar with the blonde-haired girl ALSO came over to her booth and they chatted for a while.  So I guess everyone knows EVERYONE there, which only says good things about your establishment!  :D  Thanks again - we'll be back."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan, took 15 minutes to get a server..... service was mediocre after that.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great service. I will be here again for sure. Great local spot. Prices were great considering how fresh the ingredients were. Super excited they carry my favorite beer Sierra Nevada too."}
{"text":"We found ToScany's on yelp and although we've probably passed this intersection hundreds of times, we had no idea they existed. They are a bit tucked away, south of and around the corner from the Basha's grocery store. I'm so glad we found them. We stopped in for lunch and realized we'd found a little gem! Actually, it's not so little. It's a really nice space, well designed with comfortable seating and a good number of tables so you don't feel crammed in between other patrons. It's clean too! Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and our food was really good! So I don't know what else one could want from a restaurant! Thanks Yelp, for helping us find this place! Oh...and the check-in discount was a bonus! Thumbs up all around!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, Great atmosphere, Attentive employees. Great place for a nice slice of pizza"}
{"text":"Great pizza,  great service!  I love this place,  Tuesday's is half off pizza!  They have a great menu and its clean and very well managed.  I have been several times and always leave happy! Great place for some drinks and appetizers too!"}
{"text":"I think this place is on the expensive side for what you get. Its only worth going to if you are going to dine in, the pizza doesn't taste as good when you take it home and reheat it. Service can be slow and disorganized. For this type of pizza, I think Grimaldi's is a better choice."}
{"text":"We had the caprese salad and Margherita pizza, both of which were very good.  We were seated and served right away on a busy Saturday night. Our waitress, Celeste, was phenomenal too."}
{"text":"I have eaten here everyday this week and have been blown away by the complete experience- food, service, atmosphere and price.  The pizza is tasty and fresh; the blue cheese dressing for the salad is killer; the meatball sandwich is to die for!  Absolutely everyone has a great attitude and is very friendly and \"gets\" customer service.  Price/value is excellent.  Worth the trip.  In town for 2 weeks and expect to be most days!"}
{"text":"Went in last Saturday, the bartender was waiting our table. We ordered an appetizer and a pizza. When the appetizer came out, it  was skinny little undercooked tortilla strips that couldn't even be used to scoop the hummus. When telling the bartender the problem she was very rude and even rolled her eyes. Just a horrible attitude. Then the pizza came out and only had 4 little circles of cheese. We had to then complain about that because per 3 slices there was only one piece. She then put more cheese on it but did not recut it. Made us feel very uncomfortable the whole night and the food was clearly not up to par."}
{"text":"Saw that this place opened up right across the street from my house and it was much needed.  We have a pizza hut, but there is nothing like coal oven pizza, it's the best.  I haven't had the pizza yet, but I have had their wings and OMG they are perfect.  I had the Italian style wings which are marinated over night (from what they told me) and they were cooked to perfection.  This is my new place for football and fun."}
{"text":"The pizza here is always tasty, it's not a great value at $20 + for a large, but it is consistently good. I like the flavor that the charcoal oven adds to it. They are generous with the toppings.  I ordered a Caprese salad to share between three of us. When I got home and took the box out I was amazed at how tiny the salad was. I'm not exaggerating when I say they probably had to hire someone with tiny hands specifically to make this salad. It's an absolute ripoff at $9!   I'll probably come back for the pizza, but they really need to re-evaluate the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This is new to the area but I'm so happy it's here! It's a great date night, family night or casual place to go in this area. Beautiful restaurant and I love the fire pits out front in the winter. So elegant! The food is amazing as well and the service was good."}
{"text":"Pricey but good pizza; I like they have crispy strips of basil standard instead of charging for that like Grimaldis. I wan't a huge fan at first but it has grown on me after a few visits and I am now a regular. Not on Grimaldi's level, which is a 5+ stars, but I used to do Sauce all the time too and now I do Tony Sacco over Sauce. Employees are always very nice here as well."}
{"text":"We love this place! Defiantly try the wings. They take a little longer but they are baked instead on deep fried. The bread appetizer I would pass on. The pizza however is perfect! The one with the meatballs and the margarita are my fave! The bar area is fun during games but not huge. Try this place!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place out. We went on a Tuesday night and were seated right away. We wanted to try and few things so we opted for the spicy meatballs and the Italian wings. Both were very good! We then ordered a build your own pizza and it was very tasty as well. The restaurant is nicely done and it also has a nice size bar. We were happy and will definitely go back. It's fun to watch the guys make the pizzas behind the glass. We'll be back"}
{"text":"I ordered an 18 inch pizza to go and some meat balls. The pizza was 16 inches and the reason it was so apparent that it was too small was because it was in an 18 inch box that the pizza obviously was too small for. The pizza was cold and I have had frozen pizza better. The last complaint is that I ordered the meatballs app and she instead of getting 3 meatballs I got one. Over priced and not quality pizza."}
{"text":"Tip 1: There are a lot of kids/families here.  Noise level was up from kids running around all over the place.   Tip 2: If you ask for a kids cup with a straw for water, make sure you specify you wanted water with that cup.  Other wise you will get a cup, a lid and straw.   The place was full by the time we left, 95% all families with lots of kids.  Noise level went up pretty quick as the kids were running around the place.  But this has nothing to do with the lower ratting.   I rated it 2 stars due to mostly service or lack there of.  My glass sat empty most of the meal.  Pizza was brought to the table without any plates.  Had to wait for the server to come back and check on us to get plates, and no other waiter or staff would help us as we tried to flag someone down.  In general I would describe the service very lethargic and distant.   Though the pizza seemed to have good ingredients on it, the toping all slide off the pizza as you pick it up.  Along with a river a grease.     I've had worse, but I have had much better.   For me, I don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"The recent negative reviews really surprise me because we have yet to have a bad experience. Service for dining in and carry out has always been friendly... never had a bad pizza. We have added ToScany's to our normal rotation for take out, which is really saying something because we have been stuck in a \"take out rut\" for a while.  I really enjoy and recommend the pizza Napoli. The crust is thin and crisp, the meatballs are flavorful, and I'm a huge sucker for the pillows or ricotta cheese scattered throughout the pizza."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try the coal fired pizza buffet was 7.99 but was very very limited, Romaine lettuce 3 toppings 3 dressings but the salad was not fresh cut so it was already turning brown, 2 pizzas pepperoni and mushroom but the mushrooms were old, a new pie came out bacon pineapple was much better do to the fresh crust, the place and staff is really nice seems silly to offer a buffet unless your trying to spike up business in which case if your only going to serve a few things make sure they are fresh or what's the point, pizza crust is a 3 star crust fresh 2 stars under the heat lamps, if your looking to try their pizza not a bad deal, I'm glad I tried it but not worth a return trip whatsoever, gourmet pizza buzzkill"}
{"text":"Update- we were contacted by the manager and were notified that the soda refills are free, she then compensated our experience with a gift card! Great follow up and customer service."}
{"text":"Good pizza with soft chewy dough. Always had great service as well. We have been there six times now and it has been very consistent.   Great for kids and for watching sports too."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and thought we would try out the local pizza joint. VERY glad we did. Service was excellent and we felt very welcome. When the waiter said the wings were \"the best he has had\" I had heard that before. They were actually really good and are among the best I have had. All the pizza toppings were very fresh ( they said they don't have any freezers as everthing they make is fresh daily). This will be a new regular hangout!"}
{"text":"We have been eating here since it opened.  Great pizza, friendly service.  Kids love it, too!!!  Keep an eye out, they offer half off pizza specials, occasionally.  Decent craft beer selection, too."}
{"text":"When this place first opened it was really good. It's been going down hill ever since. Poor staffing, long waits, just okay food.  Went recently at about 5:30 pm. The chef dropped our food on the floor so manager came over and told us we had to pick something else. Ordered meatball sandwich and the meatballs were burnt!!  I will never go back again!"}
{"text":"We have just moved to the area and thought we'd stop in for a pizza and beer. The experience began nicely but went downhill in a hurry.  The pizza tasted great and the outside of the pizza was nice but the middle was soft, runny, and cold.  Once the server delivered our pizza, she disappeared. Couldn't get anyone's attention so I got up to find ya some napkins. Couldn't find any utensils so we did without. Our server saw me looking for the napkins from the bar area and just stood there. So, may give it one more chance because it is close to our new home but if the experience is the same, we will not return."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place, but I was wrong. The pizza was cold, I paid extra to have regatta cheese in my calzone? I will not be going back to this place"}
{"text":"Well I don't know what to say. I'm so disappointed by our visit here tonight. I've driven by here a few times and the draw was the great ambiance lighting on the prior.  I told my husband we need to come and try this place and tonight was our \"try\".   When we got out of our car. We were greeted immediately with the door opening and being seated immediately. So the set up was over the top and then it just went downhill from there. It's a beautiful place on the inside and gain the ambiance was wonderful. I loved they way the bar area was set up as well.   As soon as we were seated our server came over with and was right on with getting us our drink orders. They have happy hour everyday so that was nice to see.  Our server could use a little help. Although she was attentive her customer service skills were, well how shall I say, less than stellar. My husband asked about the draft beers and she just pointed to the menu insert. I asked about a wine list and got the same response. The only thing was I couldn't figure out what my husband was looking at and then I realized he has the insert and I didn't.   Our order:  The Antipasto;  not bad big enough for two to share.   The meats were rolled and placed around the salad. Tomatoes nicely sliced but, green. They were not ripe at all. The olive garnish was more like a tapenade on top. Nice touch  Buffalo wings;  baked not fried. They were ok but nothing to right home about. Leave the wings to the sports bars in my opinion  Capo pizza;  we ordered a medium which was plenty for the two of us. My husband didn't want sausage so we ordered half with and the other half without. The nice thing was that the basil was a nice touch but in all honesty it was extremely bland and tasteless. Flavor was really lacking.   All in all our bill was $55 and no taste on my tongue. Really disappointed. I was so hoping this would be a great neighborhood go to place."}
{"text":"Super busy on a Tuesday night and then found out it was 1/2 price pizza. The pizza was very good. Our waiter was very busy, but attentive. Definitely plan on making this a go to Italian restaurant for us."}
{"text":"The Napoli pizza is amazing. We go here or get take out at least once a week. Never disappointed"}
{"text":"So happy for a new restaurant in my neck of the woods!  Even better that it is good...  This place just opened in the Bashas shopping center on the corner of Gilbert rd. and Chandler Hts.  Not much out this way- so we end up hitting germann and gilbert.    We ordered the garlic rotolis- which are kind of like garlic knots but bigger and yummier. Followed it with a large pizza with pepperoni (we are a pretty plain group-lol). Gave the chicken wings a try as well and went with the Italian style which is made with roasted onion and garlic.  All the food was delicious :)  The price was pretty much what you would expect...I believe our bill came to $30 bucks.    The restaurant is also decorated really well and the bar has I believe two or three tv's which had the games playing.  Seems as though people had already deemed the place to be a good neighborhood spot to sit and watch the games and the bar seats were all full.  Enjoyed and will go back!"}
{"text":"Still really on the fence about this place.  Was in Friday night.  Restaurant was really cold inside.  Pizza was so-so.  Crust was good...thin and crisp.  The rest of the pizza was somewhat lacking in flavor.  Not sure what sauce they use, but it really doesn't taste like much.  Not sure I'll be back."}
