{"text":"Nice decor and good ambience, but a pretentious Indian restaurant. Good choice of mains and starters. Very small portions, not great tasting, spicy and $$$ too. The special lamb chops was good though."}
{"text":"I believe this place had a recent makeover. The place looks nice and has a good look to it. Appetizers were spot on in colour texture and flavour. Specially gobi 65 and manchurian. Main course was disappointing as the main reason we were excited was to try roomali roti which they were out of it! But curries were not great either. Now I could compromise in quantity for quality but that  flavour  which was lacking. Drinks were subpar. Overall not as bad as other reviews says. Should try when you are not in rush. Could improved a lot. Cheers"}
{"text":"My family and I were looking to try a new Indian restaurant, and we decided to come to this place, despite the mediocre Yelp reviews. I had made a reservation one hour before arriving, and had no issues.   Upon arriving, we were greeted by the host/Maitre de. We sat our tables and the waiter came after 5 minutes. He introduced himself, and asked whether if its our first time or not. We told him that it is our first time, and we told him that we are vegetarians. He then recommended few dishes, and especially recommended the Gobi 65. He told us he'll give us a few minutes to decide on what we want.   We eventually ordered the Gobi 65, the Kale pakoras, Jeera rice, Asparagus Malai Kofta (we have never heard of this dish before, and so we wanted to try it), Dal Makhani, butter naan, garlic naan and finally Aloo stuffed Kulcha.   The waiter asked if we wanted the appetizers to come out first, and we told him yes. After 15 minutes, the appetizers arrived, and it was perfect. The taste of the Gobi 65 was great. It wasn't the traditional Gobi manchurian. The kale pakoras were fantastic on their own.   After finishing our appetizers, the main course came after 15 to 20 minutes which was acceptable as per our standards. They were served in appealing kadai dishes. All of the dishes were great in terms of taste, spice, texture and overall satisfaction. I enjoyed the butter naan as well. It was not dry at all, unlike other places we've been to. I especially enjoyed the Asparagus Malai Kofta, and I definitely recommend it.   Overall we were satisfied with the food and service. Kudos to the waiter who was very helpful and showed exceptional service.   The place did get busy, so its highly recommended to make reservations. I know for sure that I'll be definitely returning back here in the future."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of spicy food, so this place was exactly what the doctor ordered. And as someone that has worked in the hospitality industry for years, the service can make or break an experience for me, particularly on a first visit. The service alone will bring me back for another visit."}
{"text":"I've been working in the area for the past week. All I've heard is how great the Indian food is in the GTA. I made a dash for Tavva for lunch one Saturday. I can tell you I was completely underwhelmed. I travel to India 2 times a year and I really love all the variety of food there. I'm no expert but I do know real Indian food. This was good for a quick fix on an Indian Food craving but nothing more. I was the only one there for lunch - not a good sign- and they had this muzak turned up too loud. That's just weird.    I had the Chicken Tikka Masala and a paneer dish. The paneer was alright. The Chicken Tikka was not. The sauce was run of the mill but the chicken didn't have that nice charcoal flavor. It was simply cooked on the grill in the kitchen and had no flavor. The naan was nothing to die for. It wasn't bad but a bit too doughy.   I cannot recommend this for anyone except the most desperate Indian Food addict in a long over due need of a binge. It's so-so."}
{"text":"We visited for the babe's parents wedding anniversary dinner earlier this week.  I was pretty worried when we walked in here at how empty this place was (we were the only family up in this place). Thought for sure it was a bad sign.  But no! The food was great! Service was a bit awkward but that's alright with me as the grub made up for it :)  We tried a few appetizers, including a salmon dish which was so so so delicious. The mains included a chicken in a coconut, an asparagus kofta, butter chicken, and another one I forgot - all so tasty! We ordered naan on the side which was also very yummers. I would say if you are sharing at the table, order at least one curry and one naan per person (portions were a bit on the small side IMO).  For dessert we tried kir (spelling?) shooters and a deep fried cheesecake dish - both scrumptious! I would definitely return here!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and the restaurant was practically empty. Yet, the service was exceptionally slow. I'm used to Indian restaurants where someone is constantly refilling your water. Here, we had to ask for more water and that took 5-8 mins to get.  The food is ok, not bad but nothing great. Portions are small and price is high. Decor and ambience is nice but doesn't make up for what this place is lacking."}
{"text":"Either I was very lucky or things are much-improved over the previous reviews.  I was disappointed to find the place empty, but it was snowing that evening, which may have kept people away.  The d√©cor was very pleasant - elegant and understated. I was seated on the upper level, which afforded me a view of the full restaurant. Instead of seating me wherever, they truly gave me the best table in the place.  The waitress was very hospitable and friendly. And, the food was very much to my liking!  For an appetizer, I ordered the Samosa rolls. They were presented like egg rolls and in similar wrappers. While somewhat unconventional, I found them tasty, hot, and crispy. The chickpea sauce served alongside had a great level of heat and flavor. I also ordered the Masala fries with Indian ketchup. Just ok, but not special enough to warrant the calories or expense.  The Malai Chicken Tikka was outstanding! Tender and juicy, the chicken was grilled to a turn and not at all tough & dry like I've had in the past. The flavor was great as well. (It was even tasty the next day as leftovers!)  Finally, I asked for a side of Lachha Paratha. Hot, butterly, and flaky, it was an delicious accompaniment to the chicken. The sauces served along the side (mint, tamarind, and mint-yogurt) were all tasty as well as refreshing.  I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Went here for Lunch, restaurant was also empty at the time. We went for the so called executive buffet. Service was extremely slow, took about 2 hours for lunch as they are that slow. Don't bother going if you are going as a lunch break during work. They claim its a buffet but you have to ORDER from the menu, so its more of a cook to order buffet. Portions are so small. We had a group of 10, ordered enough food for 10 but they just brought out 1 bowl of each item, ridiculous if you as kme.  It's about 30mins between reorders, Never enough bread or rice, kept having to ask for refills, water was always empty, wait time between food refills was ridiculous. To the point we just gave up. First time leaving a buffet HUNGRY still. Then another stupid thing is that you are limited to 1 desert, specifically 1 choice and no refill either, theres only 2 desert choices and you can only choose 1. Doesn't sound like a buffet to me. Also ordered a few items, server kept saying she'd bring it, but never did. I would never come back here nor would I recommend ANYONE to go here. They changed owners or name's recently as it use to be something else which had a full buffet line (much better IMO). Customer service is EXTREMELY POOR and the whole half ass buffet style they have going on is just a complete waste of peoples time."}
{"text":"I ordered the Palak Paneer Poutine, the Samosa Spring Rolls and The Chicken Briyani. Overall I think they have some interesting twists on indian food...but is it worth it? The PPP wasn't as good as a poutine and not as good as a Palak Paneer dish. Same goes for the other fusion I ordered. And the Chicken Briyani wasn't really one of the better ones I've had. Very plain and lacking flavor. They did however give me to side dishes, no idea what they are, but were decent."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service . Waited long didn't got the food , came back , restaurant was too noisy with the tv sound . It seems no one was interested in the business"}
