{"text":"If you want the best Gyro in South Western PA, this is the place to go to. Tons of meat on a soft pita....Absolutely fantastic! Will only go to this gyro place! The price is very good for the food you get. Highly recommended this establishment"}
{"text":"One steak gyro and scup of soup for $12.00!  The sand which was ok....I mean iceberg lettuce, tomatoes,and 4 oz of  steak on a grilled gyro cant cost $9.00.  Place had a funky smell.  Having to see the sloppy dressed kitchen staff cooking didn't make me love the food.  Yuk"}
{"text":"Nothing like it! Quick and friendly service.  Awesome food! Gyros are ridiculously amazing! Nothing compares to Mike & Tony's!!!"}
{"text":"I eat at M&T's at least once a week - their food is really delicious, the place is super clean, and the wait staff is perfectly attentive. The atmosphere is really casual and perfect for a daily lunch spot/local joint. No negative experiences here! I work in this area and regularly go out for lunch and choose this place because they have the freshest salads by far that are actually healthy and not covered in BS, and still delicious (specifically the Greek salad). Their house soup is really good - who else puts lemon in soup?! The first time I had it I was unsure because the lemon is so unexpected, but now I order it nearly every time I'm there because it has such a pleasant flavor. It's really nice to be able to go out for lunch and not feel terrible or lethargic after. The chicken plate and the Athena plate are also fantastic - I cannot figure out how they get their chicken to be so moist, and the touch of lemon sauce on that Athena plate is fantastic.   On the less healthy side, the Steak Hoagie, Turkey Club wrap, and Fish Sandwich are just as good and come in really decent (big) portions. They use really good buns/rolls for the sandwiches that don't get soggy or fall apart. Lastly the French fries are  perfectly crispy with the right bit of softness, medium thickness, normal, good old French fries.   So happy with this place and so thankful that they opened up in this area!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing gyros and quick service. Everything is great about this place. It's quick and yummy. If you are out and about on the south side it's a good place to get some grub when you are drinking! And you don't have to wait long!"}
{"text":"Best food in the burg and great people that work there.  The pita bread is amazingly soft and the meat tastes amazing.  The prices are a steal as well.  It's so good it makes the parking situation worth it."}
{"text":"Great for a quick meal and really fun after a nice long walk around town! Very Good gyros and will go back on day we hope!"}
{"text":"The portions are great, salads are massive!!! Gyro's are very tasty. Seating is limited at lunchtime so try and get there early. Prices are fair and the staff is pleasant. Good beer selection and they always have the game on!"}
{"text":"Was dining there last night, pretty sure the waiter described below who looked like he was getting ready for football camp was our server.  I overheard him telling another employee that \"all my tables are f***ing idiots.\"  Not something I want to hear while out to dinner with my husband."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. I usually get a chicken gyro and fries. I work right down the street and I consider it one of my go to lunch spots. The reason I put four stars instead of five, is because I feel the food is good but not great. Nothing stands out enough to really rail me in. It is however decently priced and better than any fast food options in the area except for chipotle. I have also hung out here at night and I must say the have a good drink selection. A lot of good craft beers. Overall it's A pretty good place."}
{"text":"I am surprised by some of the lack luster reviews. Our experience was nothing but great!  My husband and I went here for the first time last night and loved every minute, bite and drink. For an appetizer, we started off with the M&T's Pierogies. These things are amazing. Deep fried pierogies covered with hot sauce, ranch dressing, FETA, and gyro meat. Let's be honest- everything is better with feta and this was no exception. For our entrees, we had a chicken gyro and souvlaki gyro. Both were great. The pita was very well done and exceptionally soft and the meat was cooked to perfection. For drinks, we both ordered beers and both were the way they were supposed to be: ice cold and delicious.  This place is a true Pittsburgh staple and we will definitely be returning! :)"}
{"text":"Best. Gyro. Ever.  This place is nothing to look at, but their gyros are hands-down the best I've ever had.  I always have to eat at least two, and have even been known to take down three.  I really wish I hadn't started writing this review.  I'm salivating and realizing I won't be back to Pittsburgh for months!  I think that a M&T Gyro should be the thing you get for out-of-town visitors instead of the overplayed Primanti's sandwich."}
{"text":"I was very happy to hear that a previous review that I wrote for Mike and Tony's was addressed.  The owner was aware of a previous review that was related to service.  The issue was addressed and I am happy I went back.  The Gyro's are excellent and I couldn't stay away.  Great Food!"}
{"text":"Really good. Makes me think of Zorbas in DC at Dupont Circle for the taste, not the selection.   The food is simple but good. Plus who can beat the special for $6.50 (gyro and fries).  Some don't like too much sauce on the gyro - they don't skimp here.  FYI  First time to Pit, not a bad way to leave a good impression.   If fancy places are your gig, this no frills place is not for you. Get take out.  Also, only cash"}
{"text":"Best gyro ever. I mean ever. If i feel happy, sad, mad, glad mike and Tony's either turns it around or makes me even happier.  I always get a regular gyro and a chicken gyro sauce only. It is filling, and well worth the money. Underpriced to be honest for the amount you get. The first bite you take will be pure bliss, if you haven't had a gyro from here you are living a sad deprived life. Well what are you waiting for GO GET ONE NOW?"}
{"text":"My family has been coming here since my parents were kids. Every single time I order Gyros here its at different times of day with different staff and its the same great taste every time. They mainly do one thing and they do it well which is what makes them so great. Everything is original, its quick, they always have fries ready to go and they aren't looking to charge you out the ass. They serve generously and the food is prepped right. Yeah theres minor annoyances like not being able to pay with a card and parking is terrible in that part of south side but you know what, for at least 24 years now the food has been great every time and for that consistency they deserve a good review."}
{"text":"Best Gyro salad in town. I have been to many places and gyro salads usually leave something to be desired, but this one is excellent. I think it's what under the gyro that makes it work. They use a lettuce blend, good feta, olives, a few french fries, and some tomato. They also give you a decent amount of meat where other places really skip on the salad. highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I grew up on these gyros. Thought they were great, until i tried someone else's. Their gyros are over priced, and are the size of samples. They've lived off of being the only game in town. Its not that way anymore. If your sober, you can tell the difference. Dont believe the hype. Want areal pleasing gyro? Try gali's pleasant hills"}
{"text":"I've had both their Gyro and Grilled Chix Salad - both really good and definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Straight to the point and very forward with you. Have your order ready too. A great late night stop but during the day I ask myself why I am eating this crap? It's an average gyro at best, but late night it's the perfect stop in that part of town.   Pricing is good, and atmosphere is small."}
{"text":"Inside is icky, however the food was pretty good. It was my first gyro and I enjoyed it. The price right and the service is fast. I went during lunch hour and was out in less the 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Everytime I go here the food is delicious. Sucks that they only accept cash but worth stopping at Getgo (surcharge free!!) to get cash. The gyros are packed and made fresh! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is just like the original shop, but I definitely prefer this location over the other. Every once in a while I'll go and treat myself to one of their gyros. They're filling, so I usually end up splitting one with a friend. Keep in mind they don't put anything on the side other than sauce. It's you either get the toppings on it or not at all. It's also always a bit chilly on the inside, and I feel like I have to keep my jacket on while I'm eating. Other than that the food is good, service is alright, the bathroom is clean, and the atmosphere is chill.  Update: DO NOT split a gyro. If you plan on sharing just say one person isn't hungry and only order one, or take it to go. They charged us a 3 dollar plate charge to split one, and the waitress didn't even tell us about it until we got our bill. There is absolutely nothing different. There are the same amount of fries, meat, everything. They literally charge you 3 dollars for an extra plastic basket and to cut the gyro in half. Seeing how a full gyro with fries is 7 bucks all together we should have just got another one for only 4 more dollars."}
{"text":"I came to visit family in Pittsburgh and was told I had to try a gyro from here.  Wow, it didn't disappoint.  Lots of gyro meat piled on with a delicious yogurt sauce.  The pita bread was hot but not burnt and was so soft.  I can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"So after reading the reviews for this place I was psyched to finally get my hands on a tasty gyro sandwich. I made the eleven minute drive from my apartment to Mike and Tony's Gyros and Shish-Kabobs and I was rather disappointed.   French Fries: Delicious, crispy, golden brown. Crunchy on the outside and just the right amount of soft potatoey-ness on the inside. They were also piping hot and made to order.  Gyro: The meat was under-seasoned and the sauce was not very flavorful. I've definitely have had better tasting gyros. The bread was a little crunchy/hard on the edges.   Coke: Delicious!!!  Maybe it was the rising expectations that led to this Mike and Tony's gyro experience being not so great so I've decided to give them another try in the future. Until then I will be trying the gyro shop on the next block!"}
{"text":"Great food, great beer list, friendly attentive staff, great happy-hour food and drink specials, and cheap. One of the best gyros in town. If I could have one wish, I would ask them to improve their onion rings to a lighter and crispier ring. Great place."}
{"text":"The food is to die for. Its cheap, too. We got a steak gyro and a soulvaki gyro, both combos. For $7.50, you get the gyro, a soda and a ton of fries. For the three of us, the two orders of fries was too much.  The gyros were awesome. I got the soulvaki and she got the steak. My soulvaki came with at least a dozen grilled chunks of meat enclosed in a soft pita, lettuce, tomato and tsatsiki. I ended up eating my sandwich with a knife and fork because there was too many contents for the pita. The steak was delicious, too. She got a solid sheet of steak about 1/4 inch thick. She said the tsatsiki was the best she ever tried. I liked it alot but I wouldn't say it was the best. I actually thought it was a little too salty. We also ordered the baklava. My girlfriend had never had it before but she loved it. As did our 2 year old daughter.  My only complaint is that my pita started falling apart on me. We showed up pretty early in the morning, so maybe they were finishing last night's pita. But that's my only complaint!  This place is apparently a Pittsburgh staple and it was our first trip there. Its definitely top notch. They have a pretty simple menu. Service was prompt and friendly. This place is cash only. And beware! You order first, then eat, then pay when you leave. We almost walked out after our meal."}
{"text":"I don't know if this is the same owners as the one in south side. But I got really sick after getting their gyro. I was sick for 3 days. N when I say sick I mean stuff from both ends. My stomach felt like a rock. Never again."}
{"text":"For what this place is...a divey little cash-only spot serving Greek favorites, it really hits the mark.  The gyros were ordered were good (not great) but plenty large and filled with seasoned lamb and fresh veggies with tzatziki sauce on them as well.  Fries were seasoned well and served piping hot.  We also had a spinach pie which was large enough to share (between the three of us) and was pretty tasty with its layered phyllo dough.  Small place, but kept pretty clean and service was prompt.  Would be a great late-night spot after visiting some of the local bar-type establishments!"}
{"text":"This place is cheap and you get what you pay for food wise. It's not bad but nothing outstanding on the menu. The inside is a little dark and dingy so it doesn't make for the most appealing atmosphere. They take cash only."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!  I absolutely love Mike & Tony's. My order is exactly the same every time I go (gyro, fries, iced tea, and an extra side of sauce for dipping fries and gyro). I moved away from Pgh for a few years and always made Mike & Tony's my first stop when I visited home. I've even eaten here 2 times in one day...they are that good! I'm glad to be home. Even though they are a good 20 minutes from my house, I probably go at least once every 2 weeks, if not every week.  The ambience leaves much to be desired, but I will chalk it up at character. But one bite of the best gyro ever and you won't care. Service is faster and prices are less than a fast food restaurant.  Keep in mind that they only accept cash. I don't see this as a deterrent. It helps them keep their prices low. If you forget your cash, they do have an ATM with a $1.75 fee. I'll gladly pay the fee to get cash for my gyro.  Did I mention I love Mike & Tony's? :)"}
{"text":"Saturday may 17th.  Just left mike and Tonys due to very bad attitude by the waitress.  My family and I have dined there several times for lunch and dinner.  During lunch have had good experience and the good is pretty good.    Tonight waited a few minutes before seating ourselves after a table opened up.  Waitress came and cleared the table in front of us without saying a word.  Waited about 10 minutes before she came over to take an order at a table by ours.  She then came to our table and and asked us what we wanted to drink.  When we told her we were ready to order she stated \"I'm only going to take your drink order now\".  After my wife gave her an incredulous look and order water for her and a sprite for my kids she left and I watched her complain about us to another waiter.  That is when we left and as I told her we were leaving and not to worry about our order or wiping down our table from our previous occupants, she stated ok without even looking up.  Will never go back.  Mike and tony, you need to train your staff to be much more courteous."}
{"text":"If you read my Lesvo's review then you would of read that I said they don't compare to the downtown Mike and Tony's, this is the mother load.  This place is Food Network material.  Everything any gyro shop does, these guys do it better, even more so than there own other locations!  Get the Spinach Pie, Get a Gyro, Get the FRIES!  Make it an adventure.    People say it's gross in some of their reviews, they must come from humble beginnings ;-)  Eat here before any other location...  Tell them HITTofMCM sent you."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Pittsburgh this is a must stop for a gyro. Had one just last night and it was amazing!! This gyro taste like I shoulda ordered two!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! I had a steak gyro and it was so delicious that I finished it. Normally, I would have taken half of it home. The wait time was very short. My husband and I  went in the middle of the day and the place was steady but not busy.  The only negative comment I have is our waitress nevertheless came back after she served our food. She didn't leave the restaurant, she just did not come back around to ask how the food was or if we needed a drink refill."}
{"text":"Gyros are the best in town, and their fries are nice and crispy. They only accept cash."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop by for a quick bite, either for lunch break or late night after party munchies. They throw together a tasty gyro in minutes. $5 will get you a gyro packed with layers and layers of meat. I never thought I'd be saying this but there was too much meat. The meat to wrap ratio was just divine. The meat was beautifully seasoned, although slightly a bit salty. The sauce tasted straight up like yogurt. I wasn't very impressed. I wish there was more \"Tzatziki\" in the Tzatziki sauce. Overall, the gyros at Mike and Tony's really gave that bang for my bucks. Will come back!"}
{"text":"2nd visit here because friends wanted to go. 1st time I ordered a sandwich to go w/o onions....it was loaded with onions. My husband ordered a gyro w/o onions...loaded with onions...that was the 2nd time. I chose not to order something that I had to concern myself with onions...wise decision since it seems they don't listen...dessert on the special menu with a Greek custard inside can be plain or add al a mode..I didn't request ice cream but it was going to be served that way no matter what. If they would ask you a question or listen to your request that would be great. I won't return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty good gyro except way too salty. I tried the souvlaki sandwich but the meat although tasty and grilled was not fully chewable. The meat could have been tough and should have been tenderized or was old? Hard to tell, but I don't like to chew and chew meat forever. Also way too much salt and overkill.with the cucumber sauce that didn't have any flavor. The workers were nice and good service though."}
{"text":"My boyfriend comes here pretty often I believe for lunch. He was leaving work early and grabbed some food. He got a a gyro for himself as he usually does and he ordered a shrimp wrap for me.  He was in a hurry so he didn't get to ask if they do shrimp gyros or not. That's what I wanted to be honest but I got the wrap. We ordered pick up, so we could eat at home. The was super soggy and we live close the the restaurant, so I'm not sure why but it was so wet that I wouldn't even eat it. I think maybe there were too many veggies but I will never order that again. I probably won't venture here again unless I have to or if I find out they have the shrimp gyro."}
{"text":"Another regular spot for lunches, just love their gyros. They are full of meat and a large portion of fries.  Excellent taste and great service."}
{"text":"A gross establishment but a decent gyro.  The place is absolutely gross.  I watched the kid who took my order clean his (wet?) hands with the front of his t-shirt so that he could write the order down.  I then watched him pass the order to the gyro maker, then proceed to take out a pile of pitas with his nasty hands and place them on the grill.  Once he was finished, he once again cleaned his hands on the front of his t-shirt.    I've done worse myself, so I ate the gyro anyway.  Not the best ever, but certainly not bad. The restaurant itself is pretty nasty.  Try not to touch anything.  Oh, and they pronounce gyro as GYE-row.  I guess that is a Pittsburgh thing?  Definitely not a Greek thing."}
{"text":"So good and reasonably priced. Excellent salads, full of fresh vegetables and deliciously cooked meats!"}
{"text":"Great little gyro shop.  You wont find a better one around just need one in the east side of the city"}
{"text":"First time here, heard it was good. Lived up to expectations. Good service, food and atmosphere, can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"One of the best gyros I've ever had and after eating 1 you will go home stuffed. An order of wings to start with a beer or 10 and you're set to go. Great selection of beers and great desserts too."}
{"text":"Best gyros in Pgh... Even better after a night of a few drinks!! Check this place out if u love hot fresh lamb and the best cucumber sauce ever!"}
{"text":"The food was very bland and the service was probably the even worse. The girl with blonde hair has no customer service and I should have read the reviews before coming here.. Waste of a meal."}
{"text":"Oh Mike & Tony's, how do I love you! The saddest part of moving out of Southside was the fact that I would no longer be able to walk a block to indulge in the deliciousness that is Mike & Tony s. If I was forced to eat something for every day the rest of my life, it would be the gyro special with extra onions. There is just something about a gyro from here that makes me so happy.  Service is always quick and really friendly. Gyros are hot and fresh and always taste amazing! I love their fries too, always goes good with a side of ranch. If you get it to go, they send you off with your gyro in a plain brown paper bag, just like a typical school lunch. Only this is way better than any school lunch i've ever had.   Basically, you need to try Mike & Tony's. I sincerely miss being able to go there whenever I craved a yummy gyro, and I tell anyone and everyone to check them out!"}
{"text":"Disappointing !  I ordered a chicken plate and the chicken was dried out, hard, and not tasty.  The salad was boring as was the dressing. If anyone in Pittsburgh made chicken as tasty as Moby Dick's in the DC area, we'd all be better off (except the chickens!)   I tasted my daughter's shrimp salad, and it was mediocre.  I was looking forward to the opening of this place but am now very disappointed.  The South Hills needs more choices of decent restaurants."}
{"text":"5 stars for Great gyros but the place needs a makeover. Seat in booth has a huge rip in it, seats are terribly uncomfortable and the walls are dirty. Intended to stay for whole hockey game and could only stand the seats for one period. Management needs to look around. A coat of paint and new booth seats would go far."}
{"text":"These are by far the best gyros in Pittsburgh.  I went to a Greek food festival over the weekend and Mike & Tony's seriously put those gyros to shame. The meat is plentiful and well-seasoned, the perfect amount of sauce (plenty, but not dripping-oozing-soggy-gross) and the ingredients are fresh. And it's cheap! $5 for a gyro?! It's great treat when I'm out and about in the South Side."}
{"text":"Hands down best gyro in Pittsburgh in my opinion.  Possibly the best gyro ever.  Even at 2am when there's a line of drunk people waiting, the staff is quick and efficient.  Clearly they've been doing this for awhile.  The fries are not the best, but for some reason I always get them with the gyro because they taste so good together.  The gyro is so jam packed with goodness that when they hand it to you you don't think it's that big...until you unwrap the foil and start eating it.  I always eat mine so fast that I nearly choke.  I can think of no sweeter death.  I used to frequent Mike & Tony's on a regular basis when I lived in the South Side.  Now that I don't, I try to stop by whenever I happen to be in the neighborhood.  I just can't resist."}
{"text":"The gyro sandwich is very good.  The pita is soft and fresh, the lamb meat is flavorful and tender, and the lettuce and tomatoes seem fresh and looked good.  The fries are served very hot, medium salt level, and on the light side (i.e., not fried to a dark, golden color).  They are cash only, which is a limitation in 2017.  And the setting, while quite clean, is kinda of dark and small and not super inviting."}
{"text":"Okay so yes Mike and Tony's has arguably the best Gyro in the Burgh, but the love affair for me ends there.  Oh and just a gyro is less than $5.00 dollars which makes for a very affordable lunch.  The downtown location is gross, there was bum piss in the door way. It should be some ones job to wash away the bum piss before they open their doors for business. The mural on the wall is very outdated and looks cheesy and the plaster is chipping away inside.  If anything just take your gyro to go.  I have never eaten anything besides a gyro from Mike and Tonys but my boyfriend likes the grilled chicken salads."}
{"text":"Gyros the way I like them. Delicious ingredients in ample proportions. Fresh pita.  Fast service."}
{"text":"My husband has been telling me this is his favorite Gyro place in Pittsburgh for a very long time. For some reason I haven't been able to try out until last week. I came here around 12 o'clock on a weekday, it wasn't busy when I first got there. But after I sat down for a few minutes people started to come in and it got filled up pretty quick.  The restaurant is pretty big they have couple tables that you can eat there, but I see most people choose to get them to go. I got a regular Gyro, it came out really quick and it is huge. They serve it in a basket and since the Gyro is so big it was hard to eat with my hands, so I had to ask them for a fork. It would've been easier to eat on a plate. The flavor was great, the lamp was very well seasoned and cooked. I was very happy with my meal. Six dollars for a huge Gyro is a great deal for downtown lunch, I would definitely come back to try some other kind of gyros."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this place for years! I love love love love love love this place. love! (get the picture?) =]. I have become a serious regular there- to the point that when I wasn't there for a month, an employee noticed right away lol. Amazing gyros!  My boyfriend and I order the same exact thing every time we come here. I get the chicken gyro special with ranch instead of cucumber sauce and an Iced Tea as my drink. The boyfriend orders the gyro special with everything on it and a Coke.  The food is always consistently good!  I adore the chicken gyro. They marinate the chicken for hours and it is obvious when you take a bite out of it. It's full of flavor and it's juicy! Since it's cooked on the grill, it has that charred taste to it slightly and I love that! The ranch is awesome too, although it is a little runny. The pita bread is amazing too- soft, but at the same time it doesn't get very soggy if you order take out.   The fries are delicious too- although, sometimes the cook (depending on who is working) over fries them and they are a little too crisp for my liking.   My boyfriend LOVES the regular gyro. Never anything to complain about there.  We are addicted to this place and do not plan on venturing out to try other gyro places. We already found our favorite!"}
{"text":"I loved Mike and Tony's ... But since they got taken over under new management a few years back I can taste the  difference and I don't like it at all..."}
{"text":"I go to salon on the South Side, and since my appointments are typically after work, it's better for all involved if I get something to eat before I have to sit in a chair for awhile and drive 30+ miles home afterward.  I figured that, hey, \"You're in the South Side.  The world is your oyster!\" when it comes to good, inexpensive, quick eats that aren't necessarily from a chain.  After a quick Yelp sweep, enter the five-dollar gyro from Mike and Tony's.  Hot, and more importantly, FRESH, and fast.  And cheap.  And goooooood.  I tortured the poor receptionist and assistant at the salon as I inhaled it in the waiting area like a hungry racoon before going back to get my hair done because it smelled as delicious as it tasted.  If a gyro is this good on a stone-cold sober Tuesday evening, can you imagine what people do after stumbling out of Mario's Saloon?  Mike and Tony must have to avoid getting full on mouth-kissed by patrons left and right!  One more thing: it's cash only.  That's probably contributing to how they can keep the prices so reasonable.  Don't worry, they have an ATM right there in the restaurant.  Ante up!"}
{"text":"Gotta write an update now.  Getting a couple of sandwiches to go and then taking them to a nearby plaza for some alfresco dining.  Is there any better way to spend your lunch hour on a beautiful spring day?    Well a colleague and I did just that, getting a couple of gyros to go.  Yeah, Mike & Tony's is still a great hole-in-the-wall dive, but really!  Where else can you get good cheap gyros this good?"}
{"text":"A whole-in-the-wall in every possible positive sense of the term. Bring cash, get one of the specials, sit dahn and eat yer food. The gyro is not fancy gourmet but it's just done well. Good portions, juicy meat, large plate of fries.  I work all the way on the other side of downtown but it's rare that a M&T's suggestion meets with a No from my coworkers."}
{"text":"The best gyros in Pittsburgh, The are friendly, the food is delicious and they are fast. The lunch rush gets hectic but they work well together and get you in and out. I always get the gyro platter with the fries and drink. There portions are great and you leave stuffed. They have a location downtown and on the southside. I've been to both and never had an issue. If you love gyros you must get one from this place."}
{"text":"Plain and simple, I wish that I could give this review 1.5 stars. We've been going every other week or so the past six months. The past 3 times we've gone the service has gotten progressively worse.   It's been our quick hour time lunch stop and has been greatly enjoyable, the food has been decent to good every time, and we've been able to get in and out. Unfortunately, they've either hired new people or they've gotten really lazy in regards to how they treat their customers, but I walked away feel very upset.   They wouldn't come by for refills, they wouldn't get us anything when we requested it(ranch for example), and it took them 25+ minutes after asking for our check to finally get one.   I'm not normally one to complain, and I usually find reasons for why businesses might be having a bad day, but it's been unbearable and today was the breaking point. All in all, food is very good for a lunch time meal/dinner. However the service has been downright abysmal."}
{"text":"Not a great place to go. Poor service. The Greek salad is mostly wilted watercress without dressing. It's Not Greek. Best to order the fries instead. It's more of a bar with American food. I will say that the service is quick and the food is ok."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome for a new local bar/restaurant in my area, IMO! Classic gyros and decent tap and bottled craft beer selections. And with standard bar hours, what's not to like?  For lunch, I subbed out french fries with a soup on the menu, a chicken lemon rice soup. Once I tasted it, I remembered this soup from my college days when my Greek roommate would make it in our apartment. I believe he called it \"avgo lemono,\" and Mike and Tony's version of this delicacy is fantastic! I will sample more of the menu before giving the place five stars. But my first impression was awesome!  Huge gyro with lettuce, tomato, red onion & dressing was really good!"}
{"text":"Regular gyro was on the smallish side and a little dry. Co-worker's chicken gyro was tough and over cooked. Fries were lackluster.   The to go Greek Chicken salad was pretty good according to the recipient back at the office.    Dining area was new and clean. Plenty of large screen TV's and bar service.   Over all I've had much better gyros"}
{"text":"You know what, these might actually be the best Gyros I have ever had. Mr Myers and Mr Danza should be proud of themselves.  I've never been to Greece, and if I had to think of a better Gyro, the only one that comes close, is Central Gyros in Chicago. I can't choose which one I like better, so I'm going to have to say they're jointly the best Gyro I have ever had, and therefore this really is the food gem of Pittsburgh. Of course you have to try Fiore's Pizza and Peppi's Roethlisburger too, but if you only have 1 meal, 1 time, in Pitt, and you like Gyros... here, my friends, is your Mecca. Brought to you by Mr Tyson and Mr Romo.  There are actually two locations of this, and because it had a shorter line, i think I like the Southside version better. But there is one downtown that caters to the lunch crowd, and they are excellent too. Another thing that is fantastic about Mike & Tony's is the price! Their Gyro (piled with juicy delicious meat, with loads of fluffy Gyro style pizza, sharp onions, juicy tomatoes, and creamy yogurt sauce), is cheaper than most burgers! Extremely impressive! Just like the founders, Mr Jackson and Mr Hopkins.  Gyros should be made a certain way. There's an exception, in Buffalo, where \"Gyros\" are something else entirely in some Greek diners, and are very good, if not as good as traditional Gyros. But what I cannot stand is those fake, frozen, pre-packaged Gyro strips. They are already cut out in Gyro strip shape, and they just grill those and bam, Gyros. No thank you! Gyros are supposed to be shaved off a large spindle, delicious and juicy and fresh... that's the only way to go. Add some yogurt sauce, onions and tomatoes on a Gyro Pita - the end. The best in the world are Mike & Tony's in Pittsburgh, and Central Gyros in Chicago. Nom nom nom. This place does Gyros RIGHT! So thank you Mr Jordan and Mr Soprano.  Parking is tricky and tight at both locations, so be careful. They're always a little tow-happy in Pittsburgh, though not as bad as NYC. Try around the corner from the Southside location, that's your best bet. I asked owners Mr Buble and Mr Bennett and they told me the same thing.  Mike and Tony's - you are absolutely outstanding!!!  My original review (what was I thinking)  One of the best Gyros in America, hands down. Very cheap too. Eat it while it's hot, that's the way it's supposed to be. Then let's make out, so I can taste some of that Gyro too. Well, no, I mean, I'd love to make out anyway, but tasting the Gyro is a bonus. OK OK, I admit it, I just want the Gyro taste! You caught me Blue-and-white handed! (the greek flag. Although there is nothing greek about this place. It just happens to make better Gyros than most Greeks).  So thanks again to Mr J. Fox and Mr Hawk for opening this place!"}
{"text":"Wings are good, gyros above average. Service good. Air conditioner was broken. In the middle of August. Not good."}
{"text":"Let me paint you a picture.   It's 2 am, the bars just closed and all of a sudden the only thing driving your feet forward is your hunger. For some reason after consuming gallons of alcohol all you wanna do is shove food down your throat. You are wondering around the southside with your friends, 2 girls you met in a bar and a random homeless guy who you thought was the funniest dude alive. All of a sudden you stumble onto a little shack type place with a lit sign outside that says \"mike & tony's.\"   My friend you have just hit drunk heaven.  For the rookie orderer at mike and tonys it may seem like the \"soup nazi\" skit from seinfeld. You need to know what you want, these guys move quick, they only take cash and the gyro is an even 5 bucks. Don't studder or they will move on to the next person until you are ready. Once you order, move to the right, wait for your bag and get the hell out!   Usually by the time you get to the corner you have unwrapped it and taken your first bites of this magnificent spectacle. I've seen many a rookies first reaction. You slightly tear up at first, embarassed you wipe the tears of joy from your face. Then you look down at this magical wonder you have just traded for five dollars of currency and try to speak through your full mouth of tender lamb meat, \"this is the greatest thing I have ever eaten.\"  They have won, Mike & Tonys will forever be a southside tradition now."}
{"text":"Not the same since it was sold years back. They changed the sauce and the gyros shrunk. Go to Mike & Tony's downtown for the best gyros."}
{"text":"BEST Gyros in the city! Lots of meat, the best sauce, great employees. My favorite stop in downtown for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Questionable cleanliness, place feels dirty and just touching a ketchup bottle let's you know they never wipe them off, among other things for sure.  Not knocking them for being outdated, just overall cleanliness.   If you go, I suggest take out and bottle beverages.  The soda machine is suspect.  The food is usually decent the gyros, sauces and fries are delicious.  However they reheat previously cut gyro meat on the grill, maybe from precutting to much prior to lunch.  Personally I prefer the lamb \"meat\" fresh and sizzling off the spit.  Payment, bring cash, no cards and the ATM is expensive and also not surprisingly... dirty.    I try to avoid this M&T's, but every once in a while I have a weak moment and end up with a gryo special, if I remember to bring cash.  Darn it, get a card reader."}
{"text":"Everyone thinks Mike & Tony's has the best gyros and I really think this is because they have been around forever.  Their gyros are ok but they are just ok.    The lamb is very good, but then they PILE the lettuce on and then drown it in gyro sauce (tzatki sp?).   I'd like this place more but I dont like the customer experience there.  If you are on your phone or talking to someone they wont take your order, but I get that.  there is a sign that says, \"Prices will be going up soon, =the Mgmt\" taped to the side of their register that has been there so long, its fading.  Cash only  If you want your order to go and you dont say to go, they charge you for it which again I understand, but that's crappy  You are nickle and dimed for everything  Their hummus is GROSS and the pita just comes out of a bag its not heated or anything  The restaurant is a total hole in the wall and does not appear clean, and this is largely because customers are expected to bus their own tables, and this rarely happens bc most people aren't aware of this.  There is a very sweet older gentleman who works behind the counter and I always like making small talk with him when I stop in there, but it's not often that I do.  My Big Fat Greek Gyro is just a few blocks away, and it's much cleaner and the gyros are much tastier.  2 stars because I really freaking love gyros."}
{"text":"I wanted something different for lunch, so I decided to check out Mike & Tony's. I went based on previous Yelp reviews and I wasn't disappointed. It's hard to go wrong with a large chicken pita, fries, and a drink for $7.50. There was a lot of Tzatziki on the pita, so it was a mess to eat, but it was delicious. The fries were still crispy when I got back to my office too. I'll definitely be back. Of note, they don't take credit cards as the information on Yelp says."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of Mike & Tony's. I'm shocked I hadn't rated it before. I prefer this to the one in the south side, since you get table service and they have a full  bar. The food is always wonderful and the service is good."}
{"text":"I love love love the gyro here. Every time I start to eat one I always contemplate ordering a second because they're so good. But they're also filling enough that I never need more food, except maybe a few fries on the side. I don't drink, but this is my go-to spot when I'm DDing and making someone buy me food. They're always quick and friendly and the food is consistently delicious!"}
{"text":"The best gyro in Pittsburgh is at Mike & Tony's.  I first became obsessed with their gyros at the south side location and was happy when they put one downtown near where I work.  The service and food quality is just as good as the original spot.  There is no other gyro I have had which is perfect with every ingredient.  Every piece of the puzzle at Mike & Tony's tastes amazing.  From the perfectly toasted pita, to the fresh meat, and the unique gyro sauce they use."}
{"text":"Mike and Tony's is a bit of a local novelty.  This little shack on 14th does produce a great Gyro at an affordable price.  I remember the first time I went in there it reminded me a lot of my first visit to In&Out.  Simple menu, so hurry up and order, there is a line behind you.    What impressed me about this place was the quality of the meat and the quantity that they are able to load into the wrap.  Wow.  Normally I tend to ask for double/extra meat but at the time I only had $5 in my pocket so I went with normal.  But I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of meat they stuffed into the wrap along with the fresh vegetables.    Every time I get a chance, I definitely walk through the door of Mike and Tony's to get a little slice of gyro heaven.  Cash Only"}
{"text":"Seriously, the BEST & biggest gyro I've found in Pittsburgh. Sometime's they'll have a deal for gyro, fries & a drink for around $7. Great deal for such a great amount of food! :)"}
{"text":"A hidden gem for downtown lunchers. Mike & Tony's  is located downtown on Liberty Ave. If you are traveling inbound towards town from the strip district it's in the same block as Tonic on the right hand side. I believe there's another location. because this location appears to only be open during the week.  If you're not paying attention you'll probably miss it. Mike and Tony's is probably best known for their Gyros.  My favorite menu item has and always will be the  sampler. You get lamb, rice, pita bread, olives with feta, and rolled grape leaves."}
{"text":"This is a very straightforward, no-frills place to get your gyro. Like many places in the area, it's pretty appropriate for crashing after barhopping or getting some drinks at neighboring joints. Prices are cheap, and portions are pretty big. The gyro meat is quite tasty, and they give you a lot if you order the plate--literally overflowing onto the salad part of the plate. The sandwich was okay too (we got the steak), though the meat portion seemed a bit less and it was a bit messy to eat by hand. So my verdict would be to go for a plate if it's late at night and you're looking for a filling meal. It's great how both the sandwich and plate also come with combos with things like salad, fries, and fountain drink."}
{"text":"Was looking for something non-burger and walked past Mike &Tony's. Since it had my name on it, I just had to stop in and see what they had. The man behind the counter were very friendly and welcoming to me, someone from out of town. I ordered gyros and fries, and they suggested the special which I took. They only accept cash but there was an ATM right behind me so I  was able to get some money to pay for my food. It was ready before the money was dispensed from the machine. I definitely plan on coming back here next time I visit Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"I gotta say, this place really does hit the spot..just don't tell your personal trainer you've been here. Your arteries will definitely resent you for a few days after a nice long visit to Mike & Tony's. Probably the best gyro in Pittsburgh, although I've only tried a one or two others. The cash only thing is annoying (mob ties?)."}
{"text":"The gyros are pure bliss it's heaven. The fries are amazing with the sauce and the cheese sauce is so awesome! The boxed tea is something special too! Try it! Not the best bathrooms though but the best gyro!"}
{"text":"I love Aubry! Best server ever!"}
{"text":"Good gyros, neat little place, sort of what South Side is all about"}
{"text":"best gyros ever hands down. love the salad and the vinaigrette dressing. fries are sometimes good too, depending on the age of the frying solution. make up your mind ahead of time if you're eating out or in, they don't play around!"}
{"text":"I hit Mike and Tony's late night with a buddy.   After a late night on Carson, this place is perfect.  The gyros are nearly perfect, packed with flavor and doused with tzatziki sauce. At $5 a piece, not a bad deal either, especially when they are served quick and fresh.  I would bet the fries are great too. I would even venture to visit during the day for a combo meal deal if in the mood for a gyro.     As far as the setting, the place is nothing special, but this fits right in on Carson Street."}
{"text":"There are a lot of places that serve gyros in the area.  And everyone that I spoke to said this was the place to try -- and I spoke to a lot of people.  One fine day, I just happen to be near this location during lunch hour and figure I might as well try it.  The interior is a tad dark and dank which tends to make it feel a bit dirtier than it might have been.  The associates behind the counter were nice and were more than willing to help us.  I was happy to see the spits of gyro meat turning at the front of the store -- no precut freezer meat here.  We ordered the following at the counter:  Fries Barqs Plain steak pita with cheddar sauce Gyro with tomato and tzitziki sauce on the side  Taking the rootbeer with us, we found a table.  It was a bit dirty from the previous customer and I couldn't figure out why -- the place was barren. The food was rather quick to come to the table and looked very good.  As I normally do, I tried the meat and the sauce separately.  The meat was over-seasoned while the sauce was underseasoned.  I don't even think that it was tzitziki sauce, but I went forward with my meal.  Trying to find that balance, I began adding the sauce to the gyro.  With each bite, I had to add more sauce.  It got to the point where I didn't want to add any more sauce.  Luckily, I had added enough sauce to enjoy the gyro.   I tried a piece of the steak pita and went back to my gyro -- the steak was full of fat and gristle while also being tough.  I didn't need to eat anymore of it.  The fries were your standard freezer fare and were fried properly -- crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  In the end, I would say that Lina G's has a better gyro.  I really don't like my gyro swimming in sauce and if I have to choose between Mike's and Lina's, it will be Lina's every day.  It is much easier to add seasoning to an unbalanced gyro with sauce than it is to remove seasoning from the meat.  Still looking for a gyro that is balanced."}
{"text":"Mike & Tony's is one of those urban holes-in-the wall that does one thing REALLY well:  crank out excellent gyros.  Four stars for that.  Sure, it may look like a glorified food truck with tables (and it basically is), but if you're looking for a good Greek taco, this is the place.  Like your favorite swarthy food truck guy, they give zero f-'s about your opinion.  After all, it's not Mike and Tony's ambiance, or Mike and Tony's lounge - the sign says what you came here for - and if what you're after is a fantastic gyro you'll leave happy.  By the way:  bring cash or expect to be \"voluntarily robbed\" by the shakedown ATM (it's behind you).  Even after all that, once you take a bite of the gyro, you still won't care.  And you'll be back."}
{"text":"I had the Gyro special for $6.50. I would equate this place to bowling alley food. The place looks disgusting, the appearance of the people behind counter are disgusting (if I were the owner of the place I would not let my employees dress the way they do), and the food was sub-par. The ingredients used were about as cheap as possible.  Taking a look around, you can see that the average clientele fits right in with the above description, as I was the only professional there. You'd expect that a place that puts the word 'Gyro' on the outside would have a stellar 'Gyro', but this is not the case here. This restaurant is not a Greek restaurant! It is all American!   I will not return.  *cash only*  Food Quality/Taste = 2 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 3 Stars Price = 3 Stars Service = N/A Experience with Staff = 1 Stars Decor = 1 Stars"}
{"text":"BEST PITTSBURGH STYLE STEAK SALAD EVER!! I would it eat it everyday, if I could! Great laid-back environment and attentive service."}
{"text":"This place is classic Pittsburgh and I would probably send a journalist here rather than Primanti Brothers to give him a feel for 'old Pittsburgh'.  I've been going here since I was a kid.  It is dirty, cramped, low-ceilinged and dingy as the House of Usher, but the gyros are delicious.  Which is great since that's really your only option.  If you have an open lunch and are in the South Side, jump in here and enjoy a delicious unhealthy Pittsburgh tradition."}
{"text":"Great food. Prompt and kind service. Huge portions. Love the hummus plate. Gyros are outstanding. James is the best waiter!!"}
{"text":"Complete dump from appearance but the gyros are awesome and very inexpensive. Tons of meat. Don't expect atmosphere as it does not exist."}
{"text":"Walking down liberty ave and saw the sign and figured.. What the heck how bad could a five dollar Gyro be.  Well let me tell you one bite got me hooked.  It was the best Gyro that I ever had.  I've lived in many cities in my life and hands down this was the best.  Highly, highly recommend. Don't really appreciate the sign that charges u an extra $4.00 if you sit down after ordering it to go for an inconvenient charge.  I probably would have ordered another, but I was gone already.  Besides that...GREAT GYRO!!!"}
{"text":"Dear reader,  I submit to you this humble comparison of two Gyro joints that sit within spitting distance of each other. But it's more profound than just bragging rights for the best Gyro, this is also a tale of Yelp vs. local word of mouth. You see, I was challenged by a friend not 30 minutes before on the quality of Yelp reviews vs. WOM.   So I'm getting a ride from a local (thanks Bernie!) to the South Side, and he points out a Gyro joint as being the best in P'burg (Mike and Tony's) and then I see just across the corner another Gyro joint I recognized from Yelp reviews as having 4.5 stars. So it hits me. Let's put his tithe test.   I asked to be dropped off, pull up Yelp and check reviews. Sure enough, my WOM rec, Mike and Tony's has only 4 stars, and Lesvos has 4.5. I see my opportunity to test local WOm vs. Yelp right then and there (and eat two Gyros instead of one!)  I won't belabor the results:  Mike and Tony's was a better experience for me, thought neither was perfect.   M&T's - 4 stars Lesvos - 3 stars  Now, keep in mind this is based on one visit, Gyro to Gyro. Sampling method is not perfect since there was a few minutes between eating each, and Mike and Tony's likely has an advantage since I was more hungry when I ate theirs (although I only ate half to try to control for this).  Here are some details:  M&T - total hole in the wall, but not in a bad way. Gyro came in seconds to my table, piping hot and absolutely piled with meat. It was juicy, and the pita had just the right amount of resistance. The meat was just a tad over seasoned, as another reviewer mentioned, but really food flavor overall. The tatziki sauce tasted like straight sour cream to me, with similar texture. It wasn't bad, but I prefer something a little mote delicate, with some lemon, cucumber, and a bit of yogurt tang. Overall, pretty freaking tasty.   Lesvos - also pretty good ( and same price BTW), but just missing on a couple of things. The meat was a little dry, and though tasty, not quite as tasty. There was less meat although still a generous portion. The sauce was a tad more delicate, though still mostly tasting like sour cream. The bread was not bad, but just a tad more presence than ideal for perfect balance - a little too thick and chewy.   Moral of the story? Not exactly sure, but if I had gone by Yelp alone, I would have missed out on the better Gyro just next door."}
{"text":"I had been looking for a good Gyro in Pittsburgh and when I mentioned it one day my buddy immediately said, oh man, we need to go to Mike & Tony's!  So we took a walk downtown and ended up here for lunch. There was a decent line on a weekday but these guys are pros and kept everyone moving. One guy took orders at the counter while the others cooked and one rang. It all worked like a well oiled machine! I have no idea how this guy kept up but he did with no problems. Even as people made special requests.  Everything is in plain sight so you can watch all the action. The spits turning the lamb, carving with an electric slicer(this thing is awesome and I want one!) and all the grill action is right in front of you. Now i will say, this place isn't much to look at and in the surface may come off as dirty and run down. I mean, one of the grills is even slanted!  But I digress, this is part of the charm of places like Mike & Tony's.  It shows character! And character is this joint in spades.  The best spots always have a story to tell so take it all in and enjoy.  A Gyro with Fries and a Drink for $9 is a deal! Just slide them a ten dollar bill(that's right kids, cash only!) for their troubles and be on your way to mouth heaven!  The Gyro was perfect as it comes and quite honestly huge.  You'd easily pay $9 at a fair or Greek Fest for a Gyro alone and it would be half this size.  The fries were a nice compliment but I'm telling you now, the Gyro is where the magic is. Stop in and try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall dive, makes the best Gyro I've ever had in my life. You won't believe it. It's so good. I was in town on business, and searched for gyros on Yelp. Went here late in the evening, ordered to-go, took the gyros back to our hotel room. they were fantastic."}
{"text":"A gyro under 5 bucks? Yes.   It was filling, tasty, and quick!  My friend and I biked to South Side for the sole purpose of obtaining a gyro. Under her recommendation we went here and let me tell you - it was worth the life risking bike ride. The bike ride isn't bad, I'm just a horrible biker, so getting here is actually quite easy. We ordered our gyros, went to wash our sweaty hands and came down to sit to our freshly made gyros. I love, love the gyro bread, the fluffy goodness that cushions your jaw with every bite. I would advise everyone to get this. EVERYONE."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for gyros, I go here. They are delicious and they give you a very generous portion. If you're not a fan of a ton of sauce I recommend you ask for it on the side. They give you a very generous portion of that also. My only complaint is that I get too hot in the restaurant due to the meat cookers radiating heat at the customers ordering in line. That being said, this is my favorite gyro place."}
{"text":"Great value and excellent taste! I got a few gyros which were loaded with tastefully seasoned meat. I ordered two because usually it takes that much to fill me up, but I was full after the first one :)  Their feta / olive side was also favorably portioned with enough to share between two people.   They'll get me next time in in the mood for gyro."}
{"text":"Great $7 lunch special (gyro, fries and drink).  They do charge for drink refills. and only take cash.  You don't go for the atmosphere; looks like a dump!  I recommend carryout only.  The gyros are pretty good.  Greek Gyro in Market square gives you more to eat but you are comparing $11 versus the $7 here."}
{"text":"For a small local place - the food is great and you get what u pay for! I was here for the first time last week (1/27/12) - definitely will be heading back"}
{"text":"This place is tucked away, but they serve delicious gyros/ spinach pies and have great prices. It's no smoking inside so even though it's small I don't feel suffocated."}
{"text":"You wont get atmosphere, you wont get 5-star service, but you will get the best deal on food in town.  Its all about $5 for the best gyro and fries (and drink) in town.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"The BEST Gyros in Pittsburgh!  The meat perfectly seasoned as is the tzatziki.  I've tried other gyros around town and while there are good gyros to be found, each time I go back to Mike & Tony's I'm reminded of how much better theirs are!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I both ordered Gyro sandwich specials and we both loveeed our choice. The sandwich is full of Gyro and has lettuce, tomatoes, and a Gyro sauce. The fries were crispy and the guy gave us both a lot! We came before they were closing so it was really nice of the staff to serve us. Would definitely order from again!"}
{"text":"Worst gyro on the South Side.   At one time it was a good place to get a good gyro,  not now.  The place is utterly filthy   After eating came the stomach cramps then came the diarrhea."}
{"text":"Yummy gyros for cheep. All ingredients are fresh and they make it right I front of you so you can see everything that goes into your gyro. Fast service. Food is ready in less than 3 mins. Perfect if you are looking for a fast meal or just like gyros. Hits the spot after a long night out on the Southside."}
{"text":"I'm from Pittsburgh and currently live in Atlanta...and am yet to find a gyro anywhere that even comes close...I get homesick when I think of Mike and Tony's!"}
{"text":"We ordered what they're famous for (gyros and fries) and...I loved everything about it, except the food, which was just okay.  The service was great, the staff were nice, but to achieve true greatness, I think the pita needs to be fried on the griddle with a bit of butter for crispy contrast, and the tzaziki does need a little zip, and even some cucumber.  Don't get me wrong: this is a solid entry in the \"what should we eat for lunch?\" quiz, but it needs a little more finesse to knock my socks off."}
{"text":"If you must have mystery meat snack after a night of over imbibing in South Side, make the stop at Mike & Tony's.  Add some fries.  Get some Ice Tea.  Jam the gyro and fries down, wash it up with some tea, and you'll feel ready to blow cookies when you walk out. This means you will feel satisfied on all counts. Seriously, it tastes good. We're all gonna die anyway right?  Oh, and if you get the meatshave gyro, get it with all the fixin's. C'mon, you know it's good!  Don't forget to pay...oh, you'll pay, alright."}
{"text":"If you're obsessed with feta cheese like me, you must try the buffalo feta and hot garlic feta wings! They are SO delicious! We got the M&T fries too which were also amazing! Service was good and they have a nice selection of beer as well. I recommend the wings but will def go back to try a gyro! I saw a few come out and they looked so good. It's a nice little place that will def satisfy your fried food cravings!"}
{"text":"First time at this Mike & Tony's and was pleasantly surprised to find it is a sit-down, very clean restaurant with a full service bar! Cabernet, yes please! Friendly, quick service, delicious gyros and hot, fresh homemade fries. Recommend, and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The best gyro I ever had. Only place in Pittsburgh to get one from. The fries are good too!!"}
{"text":"This place is like a little dirty hole in the wall, but in the best possible way. The BF and I stopped in for a late lunch last week, mostly because he had never been there. I ordered your basic gyro and he got the Souvlaki gyro, which is pork, I think. We also got the spinach pie to share. I really enjoyed mine. For me, their gyros are second only to St. Nicks Greek food festival. Both places have a fantastic gyro, which comes with a ton of meat, with an amazing tzatziki sauce, except compared to St. Nicks $8.00, Mike and Tony's is only for $5.50! Whatda bargin! The pork was a little fatty but spiced and cooked well, and with pork you get fat, so I can't really can't blame them for that. It was also a little more expense, but still totally worth it. The spinach pie was \"eh\" for me but I'm not into that too much. The only thing I think would put this place over the top would be some kick-ass hand cut fries. Alas, they have yucky frozen fries. I guess you can't be great at everything."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the female wait staff is horrible. Bad service will ruin this business!"}
{"text":"Greasy hole in the wall gyro shop. The people who work here are very good at what do. They really kick out the orders during lunch time. The menu contains more than gyros, but I would venture to guess that the overwhelming majority of the people coming here order the gyro or gyro salad.  The gyro is $5.50 tax included as of November 2017.  Comes with very fresh tomatoes and lettuce every time. The white sauce is not tzatziki, but it is certainly delicious enough. The meat portion is overly generous to the point of making you feel greasy. Was this supposed to be a negative? It is a shame that the meat comes from a frozen gyro cone, but can't fault Mike & Tony's since Pittsburgh is a meat cone gyro kind of town.  Just to be clear, I'm not suggesting that this is great gyro that you must come to Pittsburgh to try, but the the cheapness, quickness and taste all together is a solid five star for anyone looking for a quick lunch downtown.  Cash is king here. Only cash is accepted. There is an ATM inside with a hefty fee."}
{"text":"There's a wide selection of food, and it's good enough, but nothing special. Large portions. Our group enjoyed the steak hoagies and the gyro salad and wrap. The fries were pretty greasy, and soggy. The wings were not impressive in the least. I don't know who took those pics, but my wings were nowhere as good looking nor comparable in size. The most annoying part of the visit was the way we were nickel and dimed for things like extra sauce, mayo and iced tea refills. That was pretty dismaying to see on the bill, and in all honesty it ended up coming out of the server's gratuity, because I definitely see it as a service issue. The prices we were paying for very average food definitely did not warrant all of those extra little charges, which did add up in the end.   I'd eat there again, because the gyros were good, and we were able to find things for everyone to eat, including kids. (despite the fact that there's no specific kid's menu) But I still can't see any reason to rate it any higher."}
{"text":"I got the chicken sandwich, which was basically a gyro, but with chicken instead of lamb. I really enjoyed the sauce they used. I feel like the chicken could have been left on the grill just a little longer. It was kind of pinkish and rubbery feeling, maybe next time I will get the shaved steak. I also got a side of fries that were just nothing to write home about. I feel like they were frozen and needed seasonings."}
{"text":"Mike & Tony's are the best Gyros ever!! They are full & seasoned perfectly. Every time I walked in, I'm meet with that wonderful aroma. Staff could be a little friendlier but I guess that what you get when dealing with SouthSide & staying open until 3am."}
{"text":"This is an outstanding eatery!I love the food,the people are polite,the prices are affordable,and the service is fast. Every time I am in Pittsburgh I come here because this place provides such a great dining experience to us every single time!These people are great. They have their meat on a rotisserie so you can see them make the gyros right in front of you just like how it should be.I will recommend this establishment to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and well prepared.  Staff is normally good.  I eat here every week....so it can't be too bad!  Helen is good!"}
{"text":"After a three day stay in Pittsburgh I took the bus downtown to get on the Megabus and go home (Cincinnati). I have nothing bad to say about Pittsburgh, except that I haven't found any food that I truly loved here. This was no exception.  The gyros were very standard. The fries were pretty good. The decorations were really boring. The staff was nice, but having some strange conversations in front of customers that wasn't exactly appropriate for employees of a restaurant (not that I really cared much, but I could easily see it bothering others a lot).  I ordered a gyro with no tomatoes. I got a gyro with tomatoes.  Refills cost extra. This will bring down a restaurant regardless how amazing the place is. So if the owner would allow guests to get free refills, this would deserve three stars as an average gyro joint. It's unfortunate that the owner can't part with those three pennies and give customers free refills to make them feel more welcome.  I wouldn't avoid this place, but there have got to be better restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"My lunch gyro (Hee-Ro!)  Not sure what else can be said about Mike and Tony's.  It's drab, greasy, and almost non-existent decor is what made me want to try it the most.  A place that can draw the lines it gets with that atmosphere, a ban on plastic payment, and snide directions on how to order taped to the counter must have good food. The gyros are great, 4.50 for a lamb gyro stuffed with juicy lamb, fresh tomatoes and lettuce, and a very good yogurt sour cream.  I opt for some banana peppers to be thrown into the mix and it's all good.  If you have a Lincoln in your pocket and need lunch skip Wendy's and get to Mike and Tony's."}
{"text":"Note: Cash Only!!!  Heed my words.  When you go to Mike & Tony's, order the gyro, the french fries, a beverage, and nothing else.  Do not deviate from this path.  I made a fatal error one evening last week prior to the Exodus concert at The Rex Theater.   After debating where to go eat with my fellow metallions as we waited for The Rex's doors to open, they all swayed me towards Mike & Tony's, a franchise I was acquainted with and whose low prices were too tempting for this cheapskate to resist.   Why didn't I order the gyro after relishing it once before at their other restaurant?  In the name of Yelp and wanting to try and therefore review something different, I ordered Souvlaki.   Gyros don't take long. A young man with hair long enough for me to wonder if he was depressed over having to miss an important metal concert just doors away utilized some sort of hand-held electric slicer with a disc for a blade, whizzing and whirring away at the lamb loaves flicked by small orange flames, manufacturing flaps and flaps of grey-ish, speckled protein. He crafted at least 10 gyros as I sat in a wobbly chair at a wobbly table sipping on a Hi-C watching coverage of the recent Boston Marathon bombings unfurl horrifically.  The more my Souvlaki was delayed, the deeper the feeling of potential disappointment sank into my heart, paralleling that of current evens. I watched the nuggets of pork being neglected and could almost smell them burning as news of the dead and injured flashed on the television.   When the sandwich arrived in front of me with no plate provided, my hunch proved correct.  The meat was the consistency of a door stopper. It felt as if I had stolen a 100-piece o-ring set from a plumber in a fit of insanity and was trying to chew a handful of them. The pita bread haplessly crumbled upon each bite as chunks of elastic beef spilled out of it, bouncing...bouncing off of the table's surface, nearly scalding my mouth.  \"We have no idea right now who did this or why, just to reiterate,\" I heard a male, middle-aged voice state coldly, his deep, authoritative voice resonating throughout the busy restaurant.  With 1/4 of the sandwich left to eat, I hurled the rest of the sham into a trash bin and left angrily.  \"What's wrong, man?\" One of my buddies asked. I was silent.  \"What happened? Didja get the gyro?\" Matt knew something was amiss.   \"No, I uh...got Souvlaki.\"  \"What??? You dumb-ass!\" The sound of a dozen groans and half as many hands smacking against foreheads could be heard.   \"I need dessert,\" I blurted flatly. With some more time left to spend and wanting to leave disappointment behind, I headed over to The Milkshake Factory for comfort.   A lesson was learned: Just order the gyro at Mike & Tony's. Exploring the remainder of their menu will result in grief, one that cannot be compared to that which was brought about in another state or is rained down daily overseas by our military but grief nonetheless.  P.S. I should note that I've also been to M&T's Downtown Pittsburgh location and had a much better experience, their gyros being very moist, tasty, generously appointed, and filling (that tzatziki sauce could use a little more zip, however). Not ordering the gyro was folly."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY!  Eh, \"cheap?\" By all means call it so. \"Nasty?\" That's a strong and strongly inaccurate word for M&T's. It's certainly not Cure or Trilogy, but I also saw no vagrants present.  I finally stopped into the Downtown locale last week and was treated to a batch of scrumptious, canary yellow wands of starch they call \"french fries\" that had the outer crunch and inner softness I look for in such a thing as well as that gyro...  The gyro, served up by a spunky, wiry, older fellow with an animated accent, was not able to surpass Brookline's It's Greek To Me in terms of quality but did impress with its moist, seasoned proteins, fresh vegetables, simple, creamy, mild sauce, and a gently toasted pita pocket that was as downy as a comforter yet was as palatably charred as the Indian bread known as nan.  These places have a charm to me that goes beyond food and service, and I found both to be more than adequate. Hell, the aforementioned gent minding the store asked me how everything was as I left and even bid me adieu.   If this place is \"disgusting\" (and the dining room in the back was anything but) to you, I think you've been mighty sheltered. Then again, as long as a restaurant is clean, and M&T's was to my eyes (I'm no health inspector, mind you), I couldn't care less. Decor's a petty thing to bag on, especially for an eatery like this (there's tables, chairs...walls...oookayyy...anything else is just frosting on the cupcake). Being a man of the people and all, I'd eat in here daily if possible (and if there weren't so many other joints for me to try) and likely make friends in the process.  P.S. I've noticed a strain of ugly, subtle classism in at least one review of Mike & Tony's. Get over it. Being a \"professional\" doesn't  necessarily equate with decency. I hate to break that to some people."}
{"text":"Nice place with an outdoor patio.  The sign said they have DJ on Friday and Saturday night.  14 draft beers.  Nice friendly staff.  Good Service.   The gyro was good.  Typical size and tasted good.  The fries were crispy and good once they were salted."}
{"text":"Very happy after eating lunch here. I had some burger with gyro meet on top. It was great and very reasonably priced. I like the fries too. Took two Gyros home with me"}
{"text":"If I was Richie Rich, I would have gone with Mike & Tony's in my house instead of McDonald's. I do wish they served grape leaves though."}
{"text":"BOOM-SHAKA-LAKA!  This place kicks major BOOTAY!  Even if I'm not hungry, I eat a gyro here every day.  It's my main spot to chill with my downtown work peeps.  The gyros are picture perfect.  I defy you to vomit after scarfing down one of these bad boys.  (HINT: you can't cuz it's impossible.)  Whether or not you're dining here, you should at least pop in for a FREE WATER!  These dudes are all about gratis hydration for the masses.  Kinda like Gandhi in that way.  True humanitarians!  Mike and Tony, you're my \"Gyros\"!  (pronounced 'heroes')  ; )"}
{"text":"This is the best and they support MS!!!  I discovered this place from pregnancy cravings and it cured those!!!"}
{"text":"The gyro was pretty good.  Cash only.  The place could be a little cleaner.  The staff was pretty friendly.  Would go back for more gyros. I did have it during the middle of the day, I'm sure drunken gyros might be even better."}
{"text":"Looking at the exterior alone, I wasn't so sure I wanted to go into Mike & Tony's but because of the high ratings on Yelp they pushed me in. When we walked in we were greeted with the pleasant smell of seasoned meat. The interior is a no frills, basic set up all in brown with some pictures and articles up; an arcade machine and a flat screen tv, playing espn. I instantly felt at home with the casual environment. Ordered the gyro platter and was amazed just at how cheap everything was for what we got. The meat was cooked and seasoned well and the tzatziki sauce was a thumbs up. Pita tasted fresh. Even though I ate everything off my plate and my stomach was stuffed to the max, my brain was telling me more. I know we will be back though Mike & Tony's is cash only."}
{"text":"The only legitimate Mike and Tony's in my mind. Some of it is clearly nostalgia and bias, but the other franchise places do not have the same 'burgh feel. In the south side establishment, you walk in, order your gyro in a non-standard way, talk a little pittsburghese, and then go out and enjoy carson street. Its got the steel town vibe. doesnt get much better. Its IMPOSSIBLE to find a gyro like this on the west coast. Not only do they make them terribly, they scream at you for not calling it a YEERO. ugh."}
{"text":"Best gyro in Pittsburgh. The night time crowd is a bit tense so it's better to go during the day or for dinner. Gyro, fries and ice tea."}
{"text":"It's a cheap, nasty dive, only open weekdays for lunch, with only one thing worth ordering - a gyro and fries.  The gyros are made Pittsburgh-fashion - good pita bread, a huge pile of the standard lamb-beef shavings, and topped with a very generous dose of tzatziki, lettuce, tomato and onion.  The seasoned fries with it are perfect.  All for around $7 with a drink."}
{"text":"Finally got fresh cut fries, frozen fries don't belong in any restaurant. Gyros are generous on the meat, and they have probably the best steak hoagie in Pittsburgh area.The fries were a problem, always undercooked, speed is important there. Have not tried fresh cut yet, hopefully they leave them in the fryer. Next step...Heinz ketchup, come on guys, this is Pittsburgh. That sweet imitation stuff doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"LOVE the food! HATE the service :( I usually order a chicken salad Greek style along with a feta spinach dip served with pita chips. I would highly recommend both and I often crave these dishes, but I think the service is bad. I don't believe the staff put the employee first and often seem rude. Every time I sit down to eat or order takeout, the staff is not very attentive. I'm disappointed with that aspect especially since I love the food!"}
{"text":"I really like M&T, and miss it dearly now that I'm no longer working downtown.  You can't go wrong with the Gyro Special for $6.50.  My waistline however, is benefiting from my neglect.    M&T's is a hole in the wall in downtown Pittsburgh, but that's part of the appeal.  This isn't a place you take a date, it's a place to grab lunch on the cheap & bounce.  Walk in, stand in line, grab a tray, yell your order, and enjoy.  If you go between 12-1, they're slammed, but any other time it's generally get in & get out.    I generally get the Chicken Pita Special.  $7.50 for the fresh-grilled, REAL chicken (no processed junk here) fries & a drink.  Don't forget to ask for the hot sauce bottle."}
{"text":"I won't order gyros anywhere else. These are fantastic and the tzaziki sauce is spot on.   J and I like to get them to go and then go down to Riverside Park in South Side and eat them by the river on a warm summer day."}
{"text":"Here on recommendation of coworker. It is great friendly staff, great Pittsburgh local.  Feel like most important person in place.  Gyro was great they don't skip on meat.  I will be back"}
{"text":"A solid gyro!  Went here yesterday for lunch and grabbed a gyro and fries to go. It was less than $8. When I got home everything was still hot and nothing was greasy or mushy.   They do not skimp on the meat or the tzatiziki which is great because most places I have to ask for extra sauce!  Everything was delicious! Remember to bring cash, but if you forget they have an atm in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I waited on forever and I only ordered one gyro.  Everybody else had more orders and they were out the door quick. I feel like that's not fair if you have customers order one gyro than you should get them out first then take care of the big orders last. Only because there the ones that take more time."}
{"text":"Business done correctly, open till 2 serves you with what they have till 2 and tells you what they have prior to service. Thank you!! Service done right"}
{"text":"Best gyro and grilled chicken salad in downtown Pittsburgh! Always very quick and friendly service with good quality freshly made food."}
{"text":"Me and my friends from work decided to come here for late lunch and I ordered chicken gyro thinking it's rotisserie chicken which what comes makes the chicken gyro but ended up getting diced up chicken in between the pita fries that came with it was good it had seasoned salt on it. My friend also wanted me to include the had good they had good tunes:)"}
{"text":"The best gyros in the city!  Nothing beats a gyro, meat shaved off the leg right in front of you, fries, and an iced tea. All for under $9."}
{"text":"We recently got take out and we were pleasantly surprised by how fresh the ingredients are and how taste everything was. Gyro fries were awesome."}
{"text":"An iceberg lettuce pile with very little else and cold gyro meat on top makes for a huge disappointment; one tomato slice? Three kalamata olives? A tiny amount of feta that would hardly fill up a mouse's belly?  It was barely edible and far from enjoyable.  Just because you're running a dive doesn't mean you have to serve crappy food.  M&TG&S should think a little harder amount the concept of \"salad\".  Additionally, the pork souvlaki was super full of gristle.  The floors and covered with food and the place (bathrooms included) is generally filthy."}
{"text":"We used to go here occasionally and would occasionally get take out. Used a be a 3 star. Used to have decent wings, large salads and great fries. The chicken and pork are historically tough (cut in big chunks and possibly cooked ahead of time and reheated) so we usually avoided them. Today my husband grabbed take out and the food was HORRIBLE. Greek salad had brown iceberg with big pieces of core, inedible large pieces of red onion, and a different Greek dressing that was basically red wide vinegar with oregano floating on top. Also, some of the olives looked like they were rotten. I wonder if they just keep adding fresh olives to old olives?  The wings were very soggy (not cooked enough) and over sauced and the fries which used to be good even as take out were soggy and greasy. Cooks need some training..this is basic food prep..cutting and frying, not that hard if you exert some effort."}
{"text":"Far from fancy and downright delicious. I highly suggest their gyro &/or chicken gyro. To put it simply, It is absolutely the best in town. Cash only. What this place lacks in ambiance it makes up in taste.   After 10, they only serve traditional gyros & fries. They don't care because they're THAT good. While I wish they'd serve chicken into the night, I get it. When you're as famous and flavorful as these are, you just don't have to go overboard to keep customers happy and coming back. The food is that good."}
