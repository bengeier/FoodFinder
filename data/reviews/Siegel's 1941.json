{"text":"A combo coffee house and steak house is what they are going for.  I had breakfast here and it was very good. Service was good. They got the drinks and food out quickly. The only issue was a bit slow on the check.

As for the food it is not a cheap dinner but that is not what they are going for.   The omelet was huge and very tasty. The potatoes were good and bread fresh.  I liked it.  Will update if I come back for a steak"}
{"text":"I like this place. It's in the El Cortez casino. The orange roughy special was exceptional. Good coffee. Very good casino restaurant."}
{"text":"I tend to judge a restaurant based on the bread basket. The two slices of dry yeasty soft crusted bread served cold on plate did not bode well. The matzo ball soup was good luckily and the rock crab claws fair for the cost. Service can be spotty. While I enjoyed both the Flame and the Cafe more the food is adequate especially if using comps."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place for lunch Downtown & we had heard that Siegel's 1941 had recently opened in the El Cortez Hotel, so we stopped in to check it out.
We spotted the Red Neon Sign as we walked into the casino & it welcomed us into \"Bugsy's\" domain. The restaurant has a nice 1940's decor with Bugsy's picture, bigger than life on one of the walls. The service was great. Paula, our waitress, came over right away & showed us the drink menu. I had a Meyer Lansky Mule(a New York Mob version of the Moscow Mule) & the drink was excellent. The menu has a nice variety of selections, shades of old New York choices. The food was prepared very well & came quickly. It was delicious.
This is a fun place to go & we will go back to try some more of the of the vintage mob menu choices. The food, service, & ambiance  are 5, on a 1-5 scale."}
{"text":"Been a lot of years since I have eaten in old downtown vegas. Food is good portion and very tasty. WARNING if you order the Cajun chicken fettuccine, very cajun, very good. Service tonight is slow and never received my salad."}
{"text":"So receptionist  told me I have to wear like a gentleman. .it was hot sunny day and this is vegas.. few old ladies works here.. unbelievable. . So rude..but food is not bad.. I think they have to get rid off those rude old  ladies.."}
{"text":"I'm a local and eat here every other week for lunch. It was a very disappointing experience today. It took 35 minutes to get our food and I was told the slowness was due to a turkey Cobb salad. Really? The salad came and it looked like a head of lettuce with three pieces of turkey and about 10 cubes of tomatoes. I was advised a manager would come speak to me. He/she never showed up."}
{"text":"This was our first visit since The Flame closed and we were quite disappointed. The food is not bad at all, and the $10.95 Prime Dinner was great as was the Yellow Pike, but the place is now nothing more than a diner that was at one time a lovely white table cloth restaurant with a wonderful atmosphere and feel. Not any more. The staff was good and I felt sorry for them because they had to walk so far to serve some of the tables, it seemed poorly planned. The cashier seemed to squabble a lot with her colleguess that was a distraction and once she shoved a chair away from a nice lady trying to clean a table, but I could see they were experiencing a lot of pressure from just the way the cheap skate set the place up as it was so far just to wait on the customers. What a sad thing to see a beautiful restaurant turned into such a cheap red and white and black tile joint. I must say the staff and bus people were top of the line and very, very courteous and it was nice to see some of the familiar faces from the old place. I hope the staff makes out, but this place is just a feeder place dumped on the good people who patronize the El Cortez with their money. Certainly it says a lot about what the owners think of their customers, which in my opinion is not much. My wife and I won't be going back and will instead make two trips to Binion's Steak House now, instead of the one we used to and the one at what was once the Flame. No more Flame. So sad. And really, what for? To serve breakfast and lunch all they needed to do was cover the pretty white table clothes with new red ones and set up two steam tables and two waitress stations and they could so very, very easily have covered breakfast and lunch for everyone. But, no, in their cheap minds they figured the white table cloth Flame needed to be done away with and we now see what we have, a not so attractive diner like down at the corner at three o/clock in the moring. Sadly, also, the wonderful piano player, Ray, is not there either, he's off to the side of the lobby next to an old beat up antique car. Is this the way downtown is going? Geez, I certainly hope not. Lets hope these rich but cheap owners come to their senses and go out and hire a consultant next time before they stand up and just demolish a classy, tasteful and lovely established place like the Flame. What a mess."}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened to the restaurant at the El Cortez.   Their restaurant used to be excellent with great service.  But  I have been in there twice lately and both times it took forever to get cocktails then it took forever to get the meal. Then another long wait for the check.  When you ask someone for water or anything it starts a cascade of people asking other people but no water.   Where does the server keep disappearing to?   The GM was wandering around but seemed not to notice the room full of people waiting for drinks, food, checks, etc.  Also, when the meal arrived it was cooked wrong and cold. It has obviously just been sitting in the back for a long time.  On two different visits.  I had to send it back it was so bad.   I don't really know the restaurant business but they seem to have plenty of people, they probably just need to re-think their process, I don't know.      And I used to love their 50% off Wednesdays but now the menu items on the \"special\" menu is so limited I am not sure why they even bother.       I hope the El Cortez can get their old mojo back here.    Bugsy would not be happy."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time last night.  Overall service was great...food was good as well...one problem..the hostess....Not a friendly person AT ALL.  Her name is Marilo and when I first walked up to the hostess stand, she was throwing menus on the back counter and it took her a few minutes to even acknowledge I was there.  Even after she sat me, another patron said to her to smile and she gave him a look...I assume she knew him.....When I went to pay the bill, she was throwing the server bill folds on the back counter.  I understand everyone has bad days but if you do not like customer service then you should not be in the position.  There is a time and place to take out your anger and it should not be done in front of guest.  Very disappointed in this treatment."}
{"text":"Very disappointing restaurant. Food is bland. They just couldnt get my order right. I finally just gave up and went elsewhere. I tried eating here several times and all meals were below average. I would skip this place. So many better right outside."}
{"text":"Went here to treat my kids for a late dinner (around 10:00 pm when we arrived and met the hostess). She greeted us and took us to our table.

Reasonable price, good food selection and Great Service (Des).Noticed too that servers are having fun while working. 

Love the restaurant design and atmosphere.

Definitely a place to visit when you're in Downtown Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I had heard about Siegels 1941 and been wanting to visit it when I got to Las Vegas.

Well the opportunity came and I went. 

The atmosphere here is cozy and quant. 

Observing the restraurant and notice the customer service in which was given to the customers not knowing it was the manager (Rodrigo T.) of Siegels 1941 scored major points in my book.

Rodrigo T. connected with his guest at the restaurant (with a smile and the tone of his voice was gentle) to make sure his guest were satisfied. 

After reviewing the menu in which had excellent choices, he suggested the \"8 oz.Prime Rib Special\". His selected dinner suggestion was \"Phenomenal\". 

When you visit Siegels 1941, make sure you ask for the manager Rodrigo T. because he will make you feel right at home and make sure you will leave satisfied.

Overall, because of the customer service (number 1 which sets the tone) and his suggested selection Rodrigo gave, I have to give this place 5 stars

Thank You,

Ms. W."}
{"text":"Per our server (never got his name), Siegel's 1941 has been there around 2 years. The Cafe is gone (replaced with yet another pizza joint in the area) and the $10.95 Prime Rib dinner isn't so obvious. I specifically asked the hostess about the unadvertised special and I was simply dismissed. When I mentioned to our waiter, \"we were looking for the cafe with the prime rib special\" he lied and said it (the special) didn't exist. Come to find out after we finished our meal he said they had the $10.95 Prime Rib special though Severs are told by management to not tell customers it is still available unless they specifically ask! Did I not ask before I ordered? I specifically said, \"Well, since the special isn't available I guess I'll get the 14 oz $28 Rib Eye.\"

Now, that was one of the most disappointing cuts of Rib Eye I have ever had. Reminded me of the thin cut of steak with steak and eggs found on the midnight? cafe special for a few bucks that most casinos offer.

Others ordered Filet Mignon and it was way overcooked to a travesty! 

Our beverage lady was rude, slamming glasses on the table when she did provide a refill! One whole refill! And I never did get water so had to drink out of everyone else's glasses at my table.

Server made no effort to correct the issue or offer a manager to discuss this horrible experience with. 

I'd give zero stars but I have to select one I guess... Don't waste your money here. I've eaten at most moderately priced steak houses in Vegas in almost 15 years as a local and several high end ones but Siegel's 1941 makes Outback look like a Ruth's Chris restaurant in comparison!"}
{"text":"10.99 prime rib in a town where you have to pay 3.25 for a bottle of water in most establishments...  sure can't complain about that.  With a nice sized baked potato and veggies, this was a meal that didn't leave me hungry.  And the prime rib tasted great and was cooked exactly as ordered.  Waitress was very hospitable."}
{"text":"Called up Siegel's to make a reservation, arrived promptly on time. We were noticed but not acknowledged by the woman that kept walking past us that worked there. Eventually she spoke and said \"follow me table of 2\". Classy. \"Hello\" would have been minimally cordial but ok at least we're sitting quickly. Atmosphere was decent. Waitress took our order of prime ribs, queen for the lady,  king for myself. We each ordered a coke and received waters instead. Eventually The cokes came right before the meal.  The food was decently priced for Vegas especially and it was quality meat. I wanted some catsup for the fries but our waitress was way overworked with too many tables to handle. Never got a refill on the coke. We were still eating when the waitress put the check next to my empty glass. I would have liked a coffee, maybe see the desert menu, I don't know, maybe a refill on that empty coke that was sitting there for half the meal. The manager I guess caught wind we were upset from the other waiter my wife spoke to. He was extremely apologetic and genuinely interested in what we had to say. He offered a complimentary piece of cheese cake which we accepted and it was quite good. All in all, I'd say the food actually was worth the price but not the service. EDIT I just read other reviews speaking of fresh bread and rolls. We got nothing. We got waters we didn't order, no bread. Bummed out."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE from the waiter (named D*sR*y). Ordered 50+ bacon and egg special with bread \"well-toasted\". He repeated it back, but we didn't get \"well-toasted\". Additionally, he repeated my drink order \"Irish Coffee\" but what I got was a tepid cup of coffee/cream/ and I THINK a little booze; no whipped cream (traditional presentation). My companion got his glass of water after asking twice from our waiter and then one more time from another staff member.  The manager (a stocky guy in a dark maroon jacket) passed between the tables, SORT OF asking how our meal was going, but not slowing down to hear the answer.  We were looking forward to trying this place. It was our first visit (and last) to Siegels 1941."}
{"text":"Saw the prime rib sign outside ($10.95, I think) and came in on a whim with friends. We all ordered it and we're shocked how good it was. I might even say it was the best prime rib I've ever had. We all demolished our prime rib and went back to the strip very very full and happy. I am not a huge fan of the downtown area but I'd definitely come back just for this prime rib!"}
{"text":"We are locals and we love the El Cortez. Tonight we were extremely disappointed in the service level at Siegel's and we will not be back. The soft drink runner was great, but the main server Valerie ruined our experience. A cocktail was ordered, and after asking multiple times, even from the manager, it finally arrive after about 40 minutes. Two entrees arrived luke-warm. The third entree arrived five or ten minutes later. The fourth arrived another ten to fifteen minutes later. The steak was not medium and the potato was not mashed, but we had a show to catch and just couldn't wait any longer. The restaurant did comp the cocktail and the last entree. From the looks of things, other guests at tables around us were having the same issues. The wait staff seems to spend most of their time off the floor, away from guests. Are they also cooking the food? Are they on break? It seems like a management issue if we were not the only ones with this experience."}
{"text":"If it were possible I would've given Siegel's 1941 4.5 stars. As of this visit, Siegel's is 4-days new and the food was spectacular. Definitely not the the same old Vegas manufactured garbage. Ribeye steak was perfectly done and the lasagna was clearly house made. Would be a steal at 30% higher price."}
{"text":"$10.99 for Prime Rib ALL DAY! What's to complain about? 

There was 6 of us. Everyone ordered medium rare and theirs were perfect. I ordered medium and mine came out super thin, compared to everyone else's and it was way over done. Picture posted was not my plate. But I still enjoyed the food and the service was great. Took them 20 mins to seat us even thou the place was only half packed, but it was 9pm and I understand when you don't have enough wait staff."}
{"text":"Quick review: Ordered my food to go, order came fast. I ordered the calamari, and the Cesar salad. The calamari was by far the worst calamari I've ever eaten! It was salty, tough, and the \"cocktail sauce\" that it came in had what I believe is caper juice or something in that nature. I was so disappointed that I ended up giving my uneaten salad to my Uber driver. Mind you, this place was recommended by another Uber driver...I wish I could take a star from him for giving me a place that disappointed me this much."}
{"text":"Being in an older older hotel in Fremont, you don't expect such a nice restaurant. Theme is from the 40s and named after the famed mobster and the year the hotel was built. It will not break your budget especially with their $10.95 prime rib special (you have to ask for it). Setting is perfect and takes you back in time with the retro furniture and classic photos. Nice and very friendly service which is always important. Food was very good, and portions are generous (from what I saw on adjacent tables). Will definitely have to go back and try some of the other items on the menu, as we had the recommended and not disappointing Prime Rib special."}
{"text":"Big portions delicious  food if you stay at the hotel you get a 5$ coupon The server was super nice,, the place is clean,,"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast around 10 AM. Not so packed. Our server was super sweet. The vibe and ambiance was really nice. Loved the setup of everything. Everything we ordered was delicious. The eggs Benedict and cappuccino i had were exquisite. So glad we found this place on a whim. From the looks outside, it was kinda odd but after finding it, we're so glad we did!"}
{"text":"Talk about a throw back, $10.95 for prime rib, prepared exactly the way I asked. The baked potato was perfect. All five entrees in our party were great. Customer service was on par with the way they advertise it will be. 

This is a solid restaurant for family dining."}
{"text":"Came here late night. Maybe too late because these employees dgaf. Not mad at it though. Don't order the omelet. Unless you like them from Denny's."}
{"text":"So this used to be Flame, which I heard was an awesome steakhouse.  I usually stay at El Cortez because, its easy to get to, navigate around, friendly staff AND had a great steakhouse and 24 hour cafe.  Now the cafe is gone and the steakhouse is now Siegel's open 24 hours.  I went there for breakfast and had the crescent sandwich.  It was not very good, dry and really lacking in any type of flavor, reminded me of cardboard.  The potatoes were also on the cold side and and also lacked in any type of flavor.  I miss my $5 burger, fries and a beer at the old cafe.  Might give them another shot or might have to look elsewhere to stay as I prefer to eat where I am staying."}
{"text":"I stopped by late night for the prime rib special that I've been meaning to try. I was greeted very quickly and my party of 3 was sat right away. Server came by promptly to take drink order and make recommendations. We shared some items, calamari was very tasty and crisp also the potato skins were great and enough to share. 
Then we had 3 prime ribs which were all cooked correctly, and includes veggies and choice of potato for 11$! What a deal! Overall we had a great experience and even the manager Rodrigo stopped by to check on us and we shared our experience with him. 
Will def be back!"}
{"text":"If you get the right waitress, this is excellent. You might have to remind them you want the Creamy Horseradish for the Prime Rib but the Potatoes Au Gratin or Baked are awesome. Even the Liver & Onions is good.  Be sure to tell them for the Virgin Pina Colada no berry sauce and for the Banana Cream Pie NO BERRY Sauce or the Chef may get creative!"}
{"text":"We visited Segal's in the El Cortez casino and hotel because we were meeting a friend there. I asked the waiter if he understood what \"Pittsburgh rare\" meant for a steak; he indicated he did and I asked him to have it prepared \"Pittsburgh medium\". The steak came out medium well not at all crispy the way it should've been on the top and bottom. My wife got a hamburger and indicated it was only fair. Our friend got a pastrami sandwich and said she was disappointed.

The wait service was only fair particularly when it came time to pay the check. We would not go back."}
{"text":"We stay at the Cortez about a week a month, we used to love the Cafe, now all they have is this restaurant. The food is ok not worth the price but worst of all is the service! They ignore you and only pay attention to you once you bug them, just terrible. I honestly would prefer eating at there subway!"}
{"text":"Three of us walked in at 5p Friday night for dinner.  It took awhile for a table to be cleared but I got a sense the staff was stretched.  This did not affect our service during our meal.  Two of us ordered the prime rib special (yes, you do need to ask as it is not on the menu). The prime rib was a skinny slice, less than 1/2\" thick.  The third ordered the linguini and clams special for $14.  It came with several clams in their shell and a slice of garlic toast.  All in all, we felt it was worth the price and would return.  Note that when the board states $4 wine with the linguini and clams it probably means their cheap house wine.  We were charged the price from the menu.  It would have been nice if the waitress pointed that out when we ordered."}
{"text":"Very rude service, from the hostess.   The food was so so, and the waiter was ok, but I personally will never set foot here ever again, due to rude service from everyone else."}
{"text":"Came here because we were staying in the hotel and needed something quick to hold us over for dinner. Plus we saw their sign for $10 prime rib dinner and we were sold.  The prime rib is not bad considering the price. You get 8 oz. piece of meat with vegetables (carrots and sting beans) and your choice of potato, mashed, baked or fries.  I had to order mine well done so it wasn't as great as my companions but still hit the spot for us. 
Three stars because it was nothing special just your ordinary meat and potato dinner."}
{"text":"I ate here a few times in February and again in September.  I've had the omelette at breakfast, the burger, the $5 breakfast sandwich and a really good NY strip a couple of times----not all in the same sitting.   I've tried other steaks at the Tropicana and the California, but Siegel's is better all around.    The sides are great and the wedge salad was a classic ---done correctly. 

The casino is great for people watching.   One night we got to see a local guy that had macho man Randy Savage sun glasses, a yacht captain hat, and a fur coat play $5 craps and keep everyone entertained along with college kids, business men and a few couples.   No telling what you'll see at the Cortez."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service. I went here on a Saturday night. Besides our table, there was a two people party that was just finishing and another table of 3 that just got their food. We were a party of 3, and we came here specifically for the 10.95 prime rib dinner that is advertised throughout the casino. There was no mention of it on the menu anywhere. We finally asked when the one of the only two waiters working the whole restaurant about the special, and he said that you have to mention it to your server specifically to get the deal. Our waiter comes and we order 3 prime ribs all medium rare and an order of Calamari. 15 minutes later our Calamari comes out hot and crispy. The restaurant fills up a little more. 20 minutes goes by and no prime rib. We see other tables get their food which really upset us because we where there when the restaurant was empty. We finally see someone bussing tables in a suit and tie that we thought was the manager. We asked where our food was and tried to ask how other tables, including the one next to us, got their food before us when the manager interrupted us by saying, \"I'll go check on your food\" 5 minutes later, with absolutely no apologies, the Manager says that our food will come out shortly. Another 5 minutes rolls by and our food finally comes. Two of the primed ribs came out well done and one of them was really rare. Your better off eating at the strip."}
{"text":"The food was terrible! Sandwich bread was old, french fries were soggy from an intense amount of grease, and the service was extremely slow (the restaurant was not busy). Big disappointment."}
{"text":"Food is great but service is slow and took 20 mins damn near for us to get something to drink! If you have time to sit here then come but don't come if you're in a hurry"}
{"text":"Was 40s themed. Loved it got the 10.95 prime steak with baked potato. Was delicious and got full. Would come back service was pretty quick and very nice."}
{"text":"Prime rib was the bomb and be careful it gets crowded fast but they handle it perfectly"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant 2 times and both times were awesome the food is awesome and the staff is great.  Not to mention the interior is slamming so retro looking can't wait to eat there again. If I could give this place more stars I would"}
{"text":"Mid-century modern light fixtures, rich red leather booths, dimmed lighting, and televisions showing classic black and white films from the 40s and 50s- Siegel's tries (and mostly succeeds) at establishing a classy retro atmosphere. The menu encompasses breakfast and dinner specials, a series of \"sandwiches of the world\", and a $19.41 steak dinner, which makes Siegel's not what I expected. The atmosphere is geared more toward a steakhouse, but is instead utilized as a diner. 

The $19.41 steak dinner includes a salad (heads up, the house vinaigrette is a creamy version), sliced sirloin served topped with steak sauce (usually not  something I like, but nicely zesty here),  heap of fresh fries, and a bread plate (which never materialized). The Tuesday dinner special is a country-fried steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables, which was generously sized and solid for the low $11 price tag. We couldn't resist adding on a bowl of their matzoh ball soup with challah, which was surprisingly meaty for $8. 
We wanted to share a dessert, but upon asking to see the menu, we were handed our bill- guess that makes the decision for us, huh?

Unfortunately, the subpar service kind of ruined it for me. Regulars were enthusiastically greeted, and we were helped in a polite and competent manner, but odd delays (20 minutes between courses, 10 to run our card, the dessert thing) made things a bit frustrating. The location and decor lend this space the potential to be a higher-end restaurant, if they kicked up the menu and retrained the staff."}
{"text":"We got comps so decided to come here for dinner. The restaurant itself looks very nice compared to the rest of the casino. We got there around 7 and was seated immediately. The busser took our drinks immediately and brought them out very quickly. Shout out to Kibrov (I think this is how he spells it), he was amazing! So friendly, so good at his job, our drinks were always filled, he picked up our empty plates right away, and every time we ask for something he delivers! He was the best part of the whole experience to be honest. 

Our server was friendly enough but service lacked majorly. We had to ask for dinner rolls and it was brought out to the wrong table. We checked-in on Yelp and got a free bottle of wine, which she did not know about. She kept looking at my phone then had to ask the manager. If you have special officers, make sure the staff knows about it, it was not very professional when she asked me \"Oh..what is this?!!?\" And the wine took forever to come out, then she told us \"everyone came in at once, I have so many tables.\" I know it wasn't her fault that she was behind because I could see her running from one table to the next, the manager should schedule more people if possible. 

The four of us got 3 steaks and a pasta with house salads. The house salads looked pathetic, very little lettuce with a couple of thinly sliced onions on top with cucumbers and tomatoes. Lettuces were wilted and flat, did not look appetizing at all. My pasta did not taste bad but had too much sauce, pasta was over cooked and a little mushy and chicken was dry. It was not too terrible to where I could not eat it by any means, but would not re-order. The steaks on its own were not too expensive but the prices of the sides were a bit high for downtown pricing. $7 for very basic sides: baked potato, grilled asparagus, spinach - nothing special. 

Food came out half cold and half hot, some parts were hot while other parts were cold. Clearly food sat there for a little bit before it was brought out. We were so irritated by this point we just wanted to finish and get out of there. 

So overall...service was not on par, food was not impressive, prices were too high for simple sides...will not be coming back."}
{"text":"It is a fantastic ambiance & delicious food! The steak was cooked perfectly.. I will defiantly come back"}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant seemed average. The biggest drawback was they left the paper on the sliced cheddar cheese in my omelette. It can happen. Regardless, overall nothing special or terrible."}
{"text":"Had a large gift certificate that had expired about a month ago. I had already called ahead to make sure it would be honored and got the go ahead from the manager. We showed up for dinner and even though it wasn't busy, the hostess and cashier were rude. Our presence was apparently an annoyance.They immediately said no to the certificate and I had to explain several times that we had already confirmed it was OK before they called and confirmed for themselves. We were then grudgingly lead to our seats . The server wasn't much better. I don't think she even introduced herself and we didn't get our drinks until after our appetizer arrived. She checked on us once before dropping off the check, but didn't offer dessert or drinks, both of which we wanted. All the food and drinks were really good, though having gross \"whipped topping\" on top of the banana pie instead of whipped cream was a total bummer.

The supervisor (Rodrigo?) was the only enjoyable employee and he stopped by our table even more than our server. Food was great, but not worth the crappy service."}
{"text":"Very good meatloaf and impeccable service.  A nice old school vibe with reasonable prices.  I'll be back to try some of there meat selections."}
{"text":"Service was great. I had the steak and eggs. Tasty and prepared right. Server was quick and courteous all the waiters look out for any of the needs the customer requests. This restaurant is located inside the El Cortez. It's not fancy but the prices are reasonable and the service is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"About ready to give up.  After several dining experiences...   just not ever at The 'wow' factor.  Breakfast is ALWAYS good.  Dinner is always
 disappointing. 

Finally...there are AT LEAST 4 different types of seating and lights.  Yet they insist on seating you where it suits their 'lineup'?  

HINT:  Don't  put booths...wicker...leather...cushioned seating...then decide where you want me to sit..and object when I ask for something different.   Ambience and comfort can cover a lot of flaws...but starting it out disappointing me...can influence my dining experience."}
{"text":"Forgot this place if you have children!!!! They have a ridiculous rule of no kids after 4pm. I use to go here in the evenings with my friends for their prime rib but now that I try to bring my family I am shunned. What a slap in the face driving all the way here for nothing!!! I'm pissed!!!"}
{"text":"The Skinny: skip the Cuban and the chicken pot pie (2)service: slow and inefficient for a 24 casino diner (2) value: skip this joint... There are better places in the city (2).

The hubs was craving some chicken pot pie so we decided to hit Siegel's for a good tuck in. 

We headed over to the El Cortez and braved the smokey hallway to get to the restaurant. The question is... Was it worth it?

Overall,  I am grateful the hubs decided he needed a pick me up and got us a venti green tea frappucino before getting there. Because if he hadn't,  we would have been way less patient with the service. 

Once we were seated,  the server took a while to come to our table. The buser got us some water but our server was largely MIA. This is even after we purposely closed our menus to signal that we were ready to order. We didn't know who our server was until a good 15 minutes when she finally showed up at the table. Our food also took a while (yes,  I know we ordered chicken pot pie which takes longer.... But it took 30 minutes+). The only thing our server was good at was leaving a check. Picking it up was another matter and I had nearly finished my review before she came and picked it up. 

On to the food. I ordered the Cuban which was pretty horrible. The roasted pork was dry and extremely salty. The lack of mustard mayo also added to the dryness and lack of flavor. They also did not have properly sliced pickles in there - just lay a large pickle spear inside. Plus,  the cheese was not completely oozing out of the sandwich like a real Cuban. Boo! The side of coleslaw was pretty meager and served in a small ramekin for butter. That may have been a good thing as the coleslaw was tasteless. 

The hub's chicken pot pie was bad too. The chicken was cooked to the point of mushy baby food and certainly not in chunks. The stringy bits of chicken could only be matched by the undercooked vegetables.  The puff pastry was doughy/gummy yet slightly burnt on top. Flavor wise and texture, a Marie Callender's frozen chicken pot pie is far superior to what we experienced here. Served with a side of rubbery unseasoned broccoli,  we had enough. 

Between the subpar service and the food,  there is no reason to schlep it to downtown and brave the smell of El Cortez for this. 2 starred review."}
{"text":"Ordered the crab cakes which were average flavor but small.  Everyone enjoyed their meal, prices were decent."}
{"text":"Wife and I decided on this place for a Friday evening out.  Place had a nice atmosphere was a bit quiet for a Friday night.  We sat down and right away the busser asked us what drinks did we want.  Figured cool staff going to be pleasant and on top of things, guess again.  Took over 6 minutes for waitress to even come to table and greet us.  We had a hard time understanding her for it was like she was mumbling.  She took our order appetizer was calamari,  entrees were trout and Cajun chicken Alfredo and a cocktail a margarita.  It took 20 minutes for the app to come out and at 30 minutes looked for waitress for my drink, she states it had to be made.  It's been 30 minutes for a margarita really.  At the 40-45 minute marker entrees arrived.  Dishes were good.  My chicken dish I  believe should have been something other than penne but it was good.  Wife had found a bone in her fish she like the dish Overall.  If it wasn't for the busser Christina we probably would have sat there and had no interaction with staff.  We'll try this place one more time before writing it off as a do not go place"}
{"text":"They need to bring back the old coffee shop at El Cortez. This last visit is the second time I have eaten at this restaurant; and I will never eat here again. Both times the service has been terrible, the food has been mediocre and definitely overpriced, and this last trip my food was cold in the middle. For what they are charging for the new restaurant, the food is not worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped in over the weekend for a very late dinner. Based off the online menu, I was expecting something a little more upscale but it's more like a cafe with high aspirations. It has a quaint cafe-style atmosphere that's typical in casinos, very laid back and welcoming. I really liked the homage to Bugsy on the wall.

I knew before sitting down that I was ordering the $10.95 prime rib - it's not on the menu so I figured it must be especially awesome ... It was better! The meal comes with vegetables and choice of potato (I ordered the homemade mashed potatoes with gravy) but no soup or salad. My medium-rare prime rib came out perfectly (warm red center) and to top off a great meal, they still offered a dessert menu for afterwards.

We ordered cheesecake and apple cobbler for dessert. I was super impressed that it was still fresh and didn't look or taste like it had been sitting all day.

Our server was very attentive and quick to acknowledge us despite being double-sat by the hostess. We were never left waiting or wondering where our food was - the entrees took about 9 minutes to arrive to our table - and our drinks were kept full. The entire meal (from the time we sat down to the time we paid the cashier) was 46 minutes plus we had the amazing bonus of hearing live music playing at the bar across the hall!"}
{"text":"As a solo female traveler, I sometimes run into obstacles. 
My obstacle this morning was a feisty old,
eastern European waitress from the Carla Tortelli School of Waitressing.
I ordered a cheese omelet a la carte.
In her thick accent, she asked, \"what kind of toast you want?\"
I said, \"um, I don't want any toast. I just want the omelet by itself.\"
\"But it comes with it.\"
I said \"OK, I'll have some wheat toast to ignore.\"
So she brings me a full breakfast with toast, omelet and hash browns.
I only ate the omelet - which was delicious, by the way.
She never checked back with me after serving me, never topped off my coffee or asked how everything was.
When I was done, I flagged the hostess to get my Obstacle.
She slipped me the check as she muttered \"you can eat whatever, I don't care.\"
I said, \"that's big of you to let me eat whatever I want!\"
She laughed loudly.
I wondered if my army green jacket was giving her flashbacks to the Revolution.
I charged the bill to my room, handed her the filled-out check. 
My babushka said \"you take toast for later.\"
I said \"I DON'T WANT THE TOAST.\"
We then proceeded to bicker at the end of which I shook my head and said \"you should not be waitressing!\" 
It was like a scene from a Woody Allen movie.
As frustrating as all this was, I don't want her to lose her job. Life is hard for everyone these days.
I'm Italian-American and had a bossy grandma from Naples so I get where she's coming from. 
Maybe she was thinking I'm a poor Trotskyite, what with the Commie jacket, boho bag, small specs and lack of makeup, in need of all the food I could get.
Whatever the case, I hope she'll ease up on the single lady travelers."}
{"text":"Excellent food but it's terrible
service.. waitresses barley speak English. Complained to the manager how
We had horrible service the first time

{"text":"Staff were very friendly, I was greeted and sat quickly.
Very attentive, yet not intrusive,
 Elena was very pleasant and eager to answer all of my question, being my first visit. 
The Prime rib was as flavorful as any other anywhere. The Baked potato was perfet, served with butter and sour cream w chive if desired, all on the side. This was well worth the cost. The value and quality will bring me back.
Thank you Elena, I will ask to sit in your section on my next visit. 5 hearts"}

{"text":"In a city where everyone is trying to nickel and dime you, Siegel's 1941 provides affordable comfort food in a vintage atmosphere.

The signature meal at Siegel's is the $10.95 Prime Rib Dinner, and it's surprisingly good for the price. There are also other specials running, such as a lunchtime pasta dish. The food is standard comfort fare - meatloaf, Mac and cheese, liver and onions, etc. The restaurant is open 24 hours, and you can get the prime rib dinner at any time! For breakfast, I got the sausage egg and onions skillet, and they did not skimp on the cheese! 

Bonus if you are a hotel guest - if you stay for two nights, you can get a prime rib dinner comped, and if you spend $30 at the restaurant, you can get a complimentary bottle of wine. 

The atmosphere is really cool. It's a little bit darker and has large pictures of old gangsters on the wall. The plates and some of the placemats look like they have seen better days, everything is high quality. 

Siegel's 1941 is chill, affordable, and a nice place for a meal."}
{"text":"I think el Cortez is my fav casino downtown. Inconspicuous and hip in a seedy dive bar way. I was hungry so we decided to try Siegel's. Well our first server took our order and then was never to be seen again. We ordered cocktails which are on par with any great craft cocktail joint, unfortunately because of the change in servers it took 15 min to get a drink. It's not busy here per se and that's just unacceptable. The food looked super sloppy on the plates. No love or concern for presentation. I didn't even want to eat mine. The only saving grace was Rodrigo the manager who was humble and sweet. Great attempt at customer service but a little too late to make the whole thing a good experience. Also they refused my service dog a bowl of water, because the owner was here???? I don't get it"}
{"text":"I've eaten here only when it's comped or I have free food vouchers. I get the New York strip and watch all the other people in the restaurant scrape together some change for a coffee.  I attached the pics from last week. Eat for free. Would never pay for food. No reason to go here unless it's free. Free x 100+ times! Get on my level, live like Jerome!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, the atmosphere is perfect. Our server Cindy was really friendly and attentive. I recommend this place for a big crowd or small. Affordable and the wine was a big plus."}
{"text":"Friendly hostesses. Sub par food, full of angry drunks every time I come here. People look miserable."}
{"text":"Tonight we had the opportunity to dine in a recent newly opened 24 hour restaurant at the El Cortez that was named after one time owner Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel. The restaurant achieved the blessing and cooperation of Siegel's daughter who was a teenager at the time of his assassination in 1947. She donated some family photos and even 8mm video of her father and family. 

In premise, backstory, and even aesthetic execution, I would give this place 5/5. Unfortunately, the ultimate execution falls short on a few levels. 

Yelp has this restaurant categorized as a \"Steakhouse\" but the truth is it it just one step above a 24 hour coffee shop. The restaurant is located in the former space that was occupied by the El Cortez Steakhouse which was a fine dining old Vegas style restaurant. Siegel's isn't really a steakhouse at all. It offers breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night with a menu that includes low priced sandwiches, appetizers, and basic steaks and soups. We ordered the calamari which was ok to mediocre. The Poutin was a travesty. Had it not been labeled as Poutin and instead just advertised as cheese fries, we would have probably been more impressed. 

The overall restaurant is quite nice. My recommendation would be to nix the 24 hour and go for a more traditional darker Siegel Steakhouse fine dining restaurant. The concept is done nicely with napkins, China, and mosaics all adorned with their Siegel's 1941 logo done in Bugsy's handwriting. I do recommend giving it a try but I also recommend that they revamp their overall structure. 

Service was satisfactory. Not great but not bad either. Just mediocre to okay. I think this restaurant, now a month old, will reinvent itself eventually and when it does, I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Prime rib special 24/7 for $10! Good deal, just bad, non existent service. Where's the waiters? Never received my check, had to go to the hostess."}
{"text":"Loved it overall! Somewhat of an oasis away from the slot machines and the smoky interior. I LOVE the steak and eggs so much. Steak cooked more rare than I ordered, but it was delicious with perfect sear marks and beaming with flavor. When I went to dinner though, the meatballs in the spaghetti did taste a bit like reheated cat food, but Fancy Feast as opposed to Purina One. They need to step that up or pull it. Key lime pie was also old tasting and underwhelming. Raspberry jelly should be preserves or a compote instead. It's too sweet and liquidy. Service is very friendly and accommodating. Casual but quiet and dimly-lit, great for a weekday evening out on no special occasion."}
{"text":"Ahhhh, Vegas.

While playing some video poker and waiting for some friends to arrive at the El Cortez bar, I noticed an advertisement for their restaurant, Siegel's 1941. The deal being offered was Las Vegas at its finest and I couldn't get it out of my mind. 

Starting at 11pm you can grab yourself an El Cortez burger and a beer for $6.00. 

My interest was peaked and you can bet your big ol' butt that I was in the half empty restaurant, waiting to be seated and hungry as all hell at a few minutes past 11pm. Okay, the service is horrid. One waitress, spread super thin, completely frustrated and ready to clock out... for life. She puts a lot of trust that the menu does a good enough job explaining the food because when she's at your table, she's all biz, no chit-chat. Thankfully I was already prepped and primed for the burger/beer special, which was not listed anywhere inside of the restaurant but verified to actually exist. 

I ordered mine cooked medium with a ice cold PBR to wash it all down. Twenty minutes later an impressive looking burger surfaced and I was quick to dig in. Where's the salt? Where's the pepper? Sure it was cooked to the perfect temperature and looked pretty, but damn, where's the flavor? A little seasoning could have bumped this burger up a few levels seeing as all of the other components were pretty decent. Hey, for $6.00 I'll still chalk this one up as a win."}
{"text":"This place has the $10.95 prime rib, don't be fooled! For some reason it's not on their menu (my bf actually asked the waiter about it), even though they advertise it everywhere in El Cortez. We came here at about 1230AM after the Life Is Beautiful festival, wasn't packed yet and we were seated. Our waitress was super nice, waters were refilled promptly etc. 

Of course, I had to get the prime rib - I didn't expect *too* much bc of the price but I really enjoyed it LOL. A bit on the rare side for me but I nearly finished my whole plate with the veggies and mashed potatoes (I was a big fan). I also saw people mentioned the mac & cheese on here so I had to get that & I thought that was really good too!! My boyfriend got the spaghetti & he didn't hate it.

If I'm ever looking for a cheapie prime rib when I return to LV, I'll for sure keep this place in mind!"}
{"text":"Located in the Cortez casino, this eatery is bright and inviting. It seems a bit out of place in the Cortez, but a welcoming sight if you're hungry for well prepared food. 

For a late breakfast, I ordered up the chicken & waffles. The waffles are light, fluffy, and  golden crispy delicious. They were the most deliciously prepared waffles that I've eaten. The fried chicken strips are OK (a tiny bit on the dry side). 

Our server was attentive, friendly, and made sure that our coffee cup was full and all was A-OK.  Give this eatery a go..I'm a fan."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place to eat anytime of the day. I eat here often so I've tried pretty much everything from breakfast with a begium waffle topped with fresh sweet strawberries and whipped cream to a beautifully? cooked juicy ribeye steak with eggs.  Dinner is when I go most often to eat a fresh spinach or Caesar salad with shrimp and chicken or the spaghetti and meatballs.  You can also never go wrong with the prime rib special for $10.95. The staff is always friendly and seat me right away. The atmosphere is very relaxing and the vintage decor and old time movie playing on the TV's is a real nice touch. I highly recommend Siegel's 1941 to anyone visiting Las Vegas. If you love downtown Vegas make sure you stop in for a delicious meal and an old fashioned? ice cream sundae. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The prime rib was so bad, salad tasted like it was tossed in chemicals, spinach tasted like the color green out of a can, but the basic stuff like chicken wings and fries are good. I think it's an overpriced cafe trying to be a fancy restaurant. The employees were really nice."}
{"text":"The food certainly should be commended; huge portions at a very reasonable price. The ambience is nice.
The Hostess was slightly scattered, as was the Waiter.
However, there was one person who went above and beyond: the drink/set-up/buser, Kibrow. His attention to detail and pure professionalism is rarely seen outside of 5 Star establishments. 
This man deserves every Kudo the El Cortez can bestow."}
{"text":"If Vegas is about having fun, then this was fun.  Restaurant is new and trending without being pretentious.  Menu was old school comfort foods (matzoh ball soup) but with some nice twists.  Wish my appetite was bigger.
We had corned beef on rye and a Meyer Lansky burger( a pastrami topping).  I thought service was just right. 
Loved the whole vibe of restaurant and casino"}
{"text":"I love Siegel's. You can grab drinks at the bar while you wait on your table. I had the Fish-n-Chips and Calamari. It was tasty. The server assistant was quick to get us drinks, but the server had a lot of tables so getting our it took a while before he could get to us. All the staff was nice and seemed like they were working hard. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I only write reviews when the food is great!  Corned beef and cabbage was delish!  Meatballs were awesome!  Mac and cheese was the best!  And the baked chicken was crispy and excellent!  Needless to say...we'll be back!!  Jeff and Aaron were excellent \"hosts\"!"}
{"text":"First the service was great. 
Wife ordered Liver and onions $11 + $3.00 for salad, salad was very small and skimpy but over all not a bad dinner for $14.
I ordered the pork chops, $22.00, came with apple sauce, they were good but very thin, no salad, no potato. 
asked to see the manager, he stopped and said he knew about the skimpy portions but wasn't much he could do. He said he would tell his bosses but didn't offer a free drink or money off of the bill or desert.  Not very good customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"My first time at Siegel's 1941. I received a coupon for a free bottle of wine for this restaurant. One must purchase at least 30.00 to receive the free bottle of wine. I ordered the Black Angus rib eye steak. I ordered it medium. When we got the steaks they were rare. It's ok for me, but what I didn't like was the veins and how hard it was to cut thru because of how nervy the steak was. Full of nerves. I thought a black Angus steak would be a little more tender but this was hard to eat thru. It wasn't tough,  just alot of nerves. 28.00 for a nerve steak. But the service was impeccable and the staff very polite. Also the steak lacked seasoning."}
{"text":"Las Vegas locals spot Service is on point anything you need they got it & quickly All the staff are so attentive and kind the head chef comes out to make sure you like everything and then wants to know what could be better...who cares enough to do that these days
We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a bit shadey.  The staff have more important things to do.  Not many customers.  Different languages.  Don't be in a hurry.
But, I got to tell you, the guy in the kitchen knows what he is doing.  
The $10.98 prime rib was perfect. We're going back tonite.
Oh, last nite we went to the famous Binion roof top restaurant.  Prime rib.  46.00.  If I had tied that price of meag around my neck, it wouldn't have inspired my dog to lick my face."}
{"text":"Still my go to place when I feel the need to be completely ignored by the waitstaff. It's a nice touch of throwing my plate down then walking away only to return a few minutes later with the bill and asking if everything was \"ok\". I didn't need that desert, thanks! The hot wings were pretty good."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible!  It was my first time because my friend was hungry and she thought this place would be good.  It took over 35 minutes to get a salad and fish and chips.  The fish was soaked in oil and to greasy to eat.  The employees need to learn how to treat customers.  Oh well, there are many other places to eat at..."}
{"text":"We ate at Siegel's three times while in Vegas this trip since we stayed at the Cortez.  I found it to be needlessly expensive and slow.  

The first meal (around 10 pm) the staff was slightly slow but good, but the food (meatloaf dinner) mediocre.  

The second meal (5-6 pm) the waitress ignored us while the other table (people the waitress knew) were treated like royalty. The food of that meal was good but extremely expensive for what was given to us. $24 for a strip steak with three pieces of shrimp. That's it. Just meat and shrimp. No salad, no sides, nothing came with the meat!  Who does that??

The third meal (around noon) the waiter was very good, and the waffle was good, but for $9 I think they could have given me two. I mean, really, a waffle is not that expensive to make!

I think I'd rather eat somewhere else..."}
{"text":"I love El Cortez and have stayed there 4 times in the last 6 months; however, this restaurant is simply one of the worst managed I've ever experienced.  The hostesses will tell you there is a 15-20 minute wait only to seat you at a table that had been empty the entire time you were waiting.  The service is slow & often incorrect with orders.  The water servers often don't bring anything until after the food has arrived...sitting for 20+ minutes waiting for food & drink.  The waitresses are always behaving rushed as if understaffed and rarely check on you after the food server brings the food out.  Worst of all, however, is the young care-free, lazy manager who spends more time looking at his phone than doing his job.  I've never seen him assist in any way.  He will literally walk through the long line of customers who are frustrated at how long the wait time is and say absolutely nothing.  Never checks on the tables.  I actually heard him ask the hostess \"What does Maitre de\" mean?"}
{"text":"Only one star because the hostess was nice. Only stopped in because everything in old Vegas was closed this was open.... A big mistake the menu was very lackluster and the waitress was incompetent and a complete \"B\"! When she didn't understand a question about the menu she would just tell u the name of the item your asking about... Left without eating... Like many others"}
{"text":"This established restaurant is one of the worst restaurants downtown. The 
Food would be classified as \"garbage\"and the service is farmed out to second out to second world servers that can't speak English. I regret that
I spent more than \"one dollar \"at this establishment after the fact becoming 
Very sick with a slight case of \"food poisoning\"after eating their gross burger and soggy spinach salad. I would give this establishment zero stars 
If I could.   By the way. Have your picture ID ready to show them when you give them your credit card to,pay your 40.00bill.....what a joke..we refused to do that,,,,,,,,,"}
{"text":"Got ten bucks? Want a slab of prime rib with the fixins for the price of a big mac combo? This place. Go here. Even if the waiter moves in slow motion. Even if the semi-creepy mural of a long ago murdered mafioso emblazened on the walls around you stares and won't stop staring. Go here. Eat and feel like you got one over on the system. Au jus and horse radish on the side? Yes please. Giant slab of butter on two steamed huge chucks of broccoli? Sure! The prime rib is thick cut and substantial. Unlike the the number on the check. Score."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious! Went with my boyfriend whom ordered the 12 oz prime rib. I ordered the $10.95 prime rib special... to my surprise I ate everything on my plate!
Low key casual vibe. We ended with the banana cream pie... still dreaming of how delicious it was!!
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I also have no idea why anyone would not like this place. As far as a high end steakhouse, it is not, but it is slightly nicer than your average casino diner. I really like 'Old School' and this place is cool is sparsely decorated. Restrooms are right outside  the door so no 1/2 mile hike, which is nice. Beers reasonably/regularly priced. Waitstaff was very attentive (we were there for a Saturday lunch on a holiday weekend).

I went with my partner and two friends and we all got something different and we all found our dishes to be absolutely delicious. So, if you like Chicken Parmesan, Liver and Onions, a Pulled Pork sandwich (OMG great) and Cheeseburgers (we had the Meyer Lansky burger w/ pastrami on it), you cannot go wrong. The only dings I can think of would be more fries (I love fries) and a $2.50 charge if you straight out order your food to go."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner for a reunion of a dear friend of mine whom I haven't seen in almost 16 years and I wanted to treat her to nice dinner since she's staying at the famous El Cortez hotel here in Fremont East.

I've read the reviews and they were always mixed but, my friend didn't want to travel to any of the new restaurants that have sprung opened in the recent 3 years, I optioned for Siegel's restaurant.

The wait time wasn't very long and we were seated. The decor and ambience is to reflect the old school times of when Fremont street were run by the organized crime bosses of its era.

Pictures of its former leaders adorn the walls and the furniture are echoes of its historic past.

The waitstaff are nice and our waiter Des was quick to come and get our drink order.

Shortly after, our food order was placed. It is an ala cart menu and offers many comfort food selections.

I ordered the prime rib rare, and a side of Au Gratin Potatoes.

The Au Gratin Potatoes was amazing! Cheesy, sharp cheddar flavor, buttery and creamy. So good!

The prime rib was flavorful but, unfortunately it wasn't rare as I had ordered. Small detail.

In the end, the whole experience was good and the food delicious. The customer service was also good.

I have only four stars because of my preference for prime rib.

Will I come back again? I only live a few blocks away, I may come back in the future - I've had better prime rib, but if I was put into a situation where this was my option, they may find me sitting in their restaurant again in the future.

{"text":"I order prime rib and a bake potato... and I was served prime rib and mashed potatoes; not happy I didn't get what I order..."}
{"text":"There were a few glitches with the hostess... I called ahead and made a reservation, but our table wasn't ready when we arrived.  I had also asked for a table that would handle a wheelchair, but the hostess set us up toward the back and had us navigate through the other patrons.  The restaurant itself is very nice looking, especially the Bugsy memorabilia and tin ceiling.  One hotel/casino issue is that there are no Family Restrooms nearby, and the Women's Room handicapped stall was broken - we have a full-time female nurse with us for my father, so this made it difficult for him to use the facilities.

Food : Both of the steaks we ordered were lukewarm on arrival.  After heating, both were quite tasty.  The matzo ball soup was very salty and the challah served with the soup was dry.  Nice side salad, good penne vodka, good garlic bread.  The salmon a top of the Caesar salad was delicious.

Most of these issues were handled and somewhat erased by the sweetness of our server, Linda.  She is a treasure!  All in all, Siegel's 1941 has good bones & hopefully, will only get better."}
{"text":"$10.99 for Prime Rib after a festival? Yes, please! Came here after the Life is Beautiful Festival. It wasn't too packed, which was great. I really enjoyed the Prime Rib for the price I paid. Yes, of course, it wasn't the best, but how can I complain for the price? 

Service was good too!"}
{"text":"The entire staff was great, incredibly welcoming and attentive. Really good wedge salad, TONS of crumbled bleu cheese :) NY strip was perfect. Our server, Mark, was fantastic and gave us recommendations for local spots that we loved. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We recently spent 4 nights at the El Cortez, lured in by \"the loosest slots in Vegas\", the vintage vibe, and the direct booking offer of a free bottle of wine and a prime rib dinner at Siegel's. We were looking forward to a nice steak dinner, so we redeemed our prime voucher and headed in. On first glance, the restaurant itself is quite nicely decorated. It's obviously new, but still has that swank vintage Vegas feel (unlike the casino floor with it's odd smell, yellow light fixtures, and low ceilings). The large TV screen playing classic Vegas/mob movies was a nice touch. Service started out well, then kinda fell to shit. But I don't want to get ahead of myself. Our order included starters of calamari (greasy) and poutine (not poutine). I'm sorry, but poutine by definition is topped with cheese curds, not melted cheddarjack. Regardless, the fries and gravy were ok. My partner had the prime rib, rare. It looked and tasted great. No issues there, especially considering it was \"free\". I, however, decided to live large and order a $28 ribeye, medium rare, with a $7 side of creamed spinach. And here's where it went off the rails. First I'll add that after our waitress delivered the apps, we saw her scurry across the dining room to a server area carrying a styrofoam cup of instant ramen noodles. No biggie, servers have to eat too, but it was strange to see in the middle of dinner. My steak-the medium rare one-was delivered well done. I mean like, shoe leather well done. I'm not one to send things back, but for a $35 entree I had too. The manager eventually came over and seemed put off by my complaint. I'm like dude, don't blame me-I didn't cook this. Nevertheless he apologized and promised to fix it. 
A few (literally a few) minutes later my new steak arrived. Now, I'm an amateur chef and know full well that even a Med rare ribeye takes more than 4 minutes. And I was right. I cut into it right in front of the server (who was probably wishing she was eating her ramen)-and it was rare, borderline raw. Again it goes back to the kitchen. In the meantime, the cheese is congealing on the (not) poutine, as is the cream in my creamed spinach. A few minutes later my steak comes back out. It's still on the rare side but at this point I'm over it. Fine, I say. 
The server then lets us know it's time for he break. Meaning, she wants her noodles, and passes us off to another waitress who we never see until the check is delivered. No offers of dessert or coffee, no \"how was everything\", nothing. 
To end the evening, the check was wrong. The \"free\" prime rib was charged. We didn't know who we'd be tipping. 
There are lots of places in Vegas to get great food with exceptional service-this isn't one of them. Free prime rib and wine or not."}
{"text":"Oh my god ! 
One of the last jewel left in this dessert a well preserve part of history highly recommended a most place to see if you go to Fremont, prices are accessible and food is outstanding their lattes are awesome as well. Join them for breakfast or dinner you won't de disappointed"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here multiple times during my 2 day stay. The atmosphere was reminiscent of the 1940's. There was a TV that showed old black and white gangster movies. You couldn't hear it but I think it was there to add to the Bugsy Siegel theme.  The service was prompt and attentive. The prices were inexpensive. A glass of wine is $5 and the average meal was about $14. On Wednesdays if you are 50 years old or over you get 50% off your meal (select menu) I tried the spaghetti with 2 giant meatballs. The pasta and sauce was good but those meatballs were delicious and for 50% off I loved it even more. They also serve a prime rib dinner for $11 regular price which is served 24/7. I enjoyed my prime rib dinner it was cooked to perfection, medium rare. I chose a baked potato with sour cream and scallions for my side and it comes with steamed vegetables. One early morning after gambling in the casino I had the crispy hot/Asian wings. They were over cooked but I guess that's why it's called crispy wings. They were $10 but I used the $5 off coupon (El Cortez Fun Book) So for $5 I was okay with the wings. When I order them again I'll ask if they can be lightly fried. This was the first time I visited Las Vegas and didn't eat at a buffet. I enjoyed Siegel's better then any buffet and it didn't break the bank. Now that I know about this restaurant I would eat here even if I wasn't staying at the hotel."}
{"text":"Update: came in for the eight dollar burger and beer special. Pretty good burger maybe a little dry but served with beer and chips. The prime rib for 11 bucks was amazing. Horseradish sauce was creamy and delightful. The vegetables were soggy and totally gross but at 2 o'clock in the morning when you're eating prime rib you're probably not eating vegetables either ;-).

They serve Breakfast all day. The corn beef hash was canned but hot and tasty. The eggs were perfectly over the easy. They serve English muffin. Service was fantastic. The coffee was super hot. They serve some sort of apple jelly which is wonderful."}
{"text":"With all the options in Downtown, AVOID this place. The best part of the meal was leaving. Ordered to drinks, a coors light and an Angry Orchard. The waitress came back with a Coors lt and a Guinness or some stout. They don't carry Angry Orchard... opted for a vodka martini. Ordered a plate of calamari when we ordered the the drinks. Entrees arrived, app order never got rang in. Bread and butter (toast) was brought to the table.The martini was warmer than the prime rib... The Prime Rib almost had a chill to it and was tough (jerky tough). The Ribeye was well seasoned and cooked as requested. Didn't realize neither entree came with a side until they arrived. Meat and Toast!! That's the meal. Far better places to choose from. This was just a disappointment."}
{"text":"It is very inexpensive here. Definitely a dinner ambiance  feel to this restaurant. But its clean service is hood and most importantly food is pretty good for price. I would come back. And they have pretty good wine selection."}
{"text":"Both my wife and I's food came cold- we told our server and she didn't take anything off. Had to remind our server about a side of asparagus we ordered that was extra stringy and $7."}
{"text":"So happy that on this trip back to my Favorite Casino and dinning at Siegels 1941 they have improved and have ironed out all the kinks that had my visit last time!  The service was good the food FABULOUS as usual I have Prime Rib  it was on POINT!  My new lunch favorite is the Seared Ahi~so ONO/DLISH!  The best part of it all was everything was hot and cooked perfectly!!! Thank you SIEGELS for the experience and I can't wait to return in January!!"}
{"text":"It's the only restaurant at El Cortez besides a hotdog stand and subway and for the most part is good for ONE visit if your staying in the area. The Casino is off the strip and away from the Fremont Street Experience so it is not in a busy area. In the four days I was at the hotel I never saw it full. The had an attentive and friendly waitstaff and the manager came by on both occasions to check on us. I had the 12 oz prime rib which was really tasty and very reasonably priced for Las Vegas. The rest of the table had the Pasta and Shrimp special that, in my opinion, looked like cafeteria food but nobody complained."}
{"text":"The food here at Siegel's 1941 was pretty decent. DTLV is full of hidden gems where you can get good food. 

I ordered the ribeye steak, paired up with a glass of William Hill Cabernet. I have no idea if it has any relation to William Hill sportsbook, but that would be interesting. My steak was cooked medium rare, and I honestly had no complaints. Went with the wine well. My friend ordered the prime rib, and he liked it too. It is a small restaurant, but I did not have to wait.

I would probably eat here again!"}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped at this restaurant because we saw an advertisement at the side of the building. The food was delicious. I ordered the chocolate strawberry waffles and my friends ordered the soup of the day and burgers. 
The waitresses make you feel like you're being served by your grandmother; which sounds weird but I promise, the waitresses are so kind and help you pick items that will leave your tummy satisfied lol
The service was great and the food was delicious. Portions were big and the restaurant was inexpensive too. We will definitely come back when we are in Vegas on Jan 19th-21st."}
{"text":"It's kind of sad that this is the new diner at the El Cortez. The old one had some great deals, like a $5 burger and beer special, which was made even better by a $5 dining coupon you got when you checked in (if you asked for the fun book). Brad B. said it was $6 when he was here a year ago, but the staff just told me it's now $8 and 11pm-6am only. 

So I sit here with my $5 dining credit unable to eat for free anymore. I ordered a $9 roast beef sandwich, so $4 is the modified price. We'll see how it holds up. If it's anything like their burger was, I won't be impressed. 

The layout of the place is definitely nicer than the old diner, but they aimed a bit high with the size, eh? This is El Cortez after all."}
{"text":"Poor service and food was cold and sad.  Go to Ellis island if you're looking for great food in the area."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, food is great!
Have to try the $10.95 prime rib special. Really hungry?  Order 2 of them!"}
{"text":"Wow! Prime rib for $10.95! It was delicious. I ordered my rib medium rare w/ mashed potatoes w/ a light brown gravy and their seasonal veggies. It came w/ at jus sauce! It was to die for! The severs were awsome and very nice to us and the service was fast Also. The wait time for our food wasn't long at all either! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I came to Siegel's 1941 twice since my original visit nearly two years ago when it first opened.  Both times my meal has been less than satisfactory.

On my first return, service was so bad that it took approximately 10 minutes from the time I ordered a piece of pie for dessert.  My server even walked out with an empty bowl requested by the table next to me and then made a trip back to the kitchen.  You can't carry a small bowl and a piece of pie at the same time.  

I returned last week for breakfast.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict.  The menu describes is like this: \"Poached Eggs Served over Toasted English Muffins and Canadian Bacon. Topped with Hollandaise Sauce and Served with Hash Browns.\"  The Hollandaise had to be from a can or bottle.  If it's made in house, the chef ought to be ashamed!  The Canadian bacon was more like two thin slices of ham, and the plating was atrocious.  Someone just took a ladle and dumped the Hollandaise smearing it along the side of the dish and partway into the hash browns.

The quality has gone downhill and it's not worth coming here even if the meal is comped.  I'll go elsewhere.  It appears they didn't work on their fourth star very much but instead went backwards."}
{"text":"Well, that surprised me.

My wife and I enjoyed dinner there Sunday evening. The prices were very affordable and the filet was excellent. The deep fried Walleye reminded me of my youth in Wisconsin. Yes, it was that delicious. 

Service was attentive. They do have a dress code, which is much appreciated.

If you are thinking about maybe eating here, my recommendation is to give it a try. You won't be disappointed and you may have even found your new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"This was not a good experience. We came in about 8 pm and were told it would be a 30 minute wait even though there were many open tables. No big deal. Once we sat, it took a bit for our server to come see us and while he took our order he seemed a bit confused. He forgot to ask how I wanted my prime rib. When our order came, there were several issues. My prime rib was well done because he had not asked, and I prefer it rare. My boyfriend and I both had prime rib and the cut was only about 1/4 inch thick. He did take my prime rib and brought out a rare one, which was about an inch thick and really good. My friends got dinners with salad and they had to request croutons for their salad a few times. One person ordered a Chicago dog, no onions and no tomatoes. It came out as a bare hot dog on a stale bun. When she asked about the other condiments, he looked confused and had to go get a menu to see what she was talking about. He came out three different times and once told her nobody knew what peppers they were talking about on the menu. He finally brought out another hot dog with some items on it. The bill was another fiasco. The salads were the wrong price, the add ons for the burger were on the prime rib, and he could not split the bill. It was below average food with very inconsistent service. It's too bad, I had been looking forward to going here."}
{"text":"Just took a to go order back to the room. Traveling solo and this really seems like a place to take a date. I liked the atmosphere however. Lots of locals at this place so I figured the value was good. 

I ordered the Flamingo turkey burger and coleslaw with a side of onion rings. It was a little over $20 so not super cheap. 

The burger was really good, super fresh avocados and the onion rings were crunch and good. 

I think the Prime RIs is what you go here for, along with the specials and comps. Nice place inside the Cortez."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant tucked into the el cortez. The food was good the meatball appetizers were excellent. The service was good and the prices were reasonable. Never got the complimentary rolls that everyone else did  though"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, & while it's not the best place in town the food is really good for the money. The menu has a ton of options. I haven't had a bad dish here yet, & you can't go wrong with the prime rib special. The staff always seems friendly, and the manager Rodrigo is always around making sure everyone is enjoying their meal."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Siegels 1941. I really enjoyed it here. It had a very comfortable atmosphere. 
My family and I went for a night out downtown, and decided to stop here and have some dinner since we've heard about this place but never have been here. 

We had the shrimp scampi which was very tasty. In my opinion it was more like a Shrimp Alfredo but it was delicious and very filling. The Calamari was one of my favorites. The sauce it comes with has a nice spicy kick to it. It was a perfect flavor. 
Also, we had the Filet Mignon. It was flavorful with a side of potatoes and veggies. FYI They dont add seasoning so if you want seasoning added to your steak request it. 
The New York strip was another choice of ours. It was a juicy, tasty steak I got cajun seasoning added to mine and it was really good. Also I got a side of macaroni of cheese with it. The macaroni and cheese had amazing flavor of different cheeses and crispy on top. My daughter got the chicken tenders and she devoured them which is a good sign. We also ordered the potato skins which were pretty good as well.

To top off our dinner we all shared the bread pudding. The ice cream on the side is vanilla bean ice cream. None of that fake ice cream it was real vanilla bean, and the bread pudding was delicious. It was a nice way to end the meal. The manager was very nice. He came by and asked how everything was. We will definitely be going back for dinner or maybe even a lunch when we head downtown again."}
{"text":"Best to have reservations! The wait here can be quite long. I brought my parents here for some old-style Vegas dining, and the wait was 40 min.  We all had the prime rib special, and it was delicious! Rare is rare, so hope you like blood on your plate if you go this route. This is in my neighborhood now, so I look forward to coming back again many times."}
{"text":"Planning a return visit in August, but remember what a great meal and service my wife and I had in August of 2017! This is a very nice place (as is the casino) with a wide range of dining options and a very nice wine list.
I wouldn't consider this \"fine dining\" by any stretch of the imagination, but consider it upscale casual. Go for a drink in the Parlor Bar next door beforehand for another treat! They have a happy hour that runs 4-6.
Our host that evening made sure we were well taken care of and added to our experience. Try the Prime Rib special for a real value - delicious!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Newly remodeled. Had the Lasagna and wife had Filet Mignon. We both really enjoyed our meals except for the side salad."}
{"text":"There was a wait list when we showed up at midnight and there were literally only 8 tables with people sitting. After waiting for 10 minutes to get a seat the servers passed by us 4 times without asking us for a drink order or welcoming us. Then when she came to our table and sis not seem like She wanted to wait on us. Food took long to come, bill took long to get, and we will not be back."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, and not crowded at all. Very classy setting, with vintage mob movies playing on the walls. My server Danielle was very sweet and attentive, and the \"Lucky Luciano\" burger was cooked to medium-rare perfection! Aside from the low-class couple nearby who were loudly dropping F-bombs, this is a great, inexpensive restaurant to enjoy comfort American diner food with a slight upscale twist."}
{"text":"The food here is acceptable. The prices are reasonable. The service here is SLOW. There are honestly better places to spend your Vegas time and money."}
{"text":"Not my place for sure... The drink sucked... I ordered  a mule... Sucked.... no mint and tasted flat... I ordered the chicken wings... They refunded my money on this part... they came out uneatable... Dry is being nice... Prime rib is more like prime fat with some meat.... Never eat here again"}
{"text":"Great service. Overall, the value of a lot of the specialty and featured menu items are exceptional. Order those!

You start off with a plate of warm dinner rolls with butter. The prime rib special is such a value at $11. It comes with a potato preparation of your choice and mixed veggies of carrots with white & green beans.

Had the airflown walleye, its a special fish from the great lakes. Got it deep fried and sauteed, both styles were 3 large juicy white meat fillets without bone. Its served ala carte so plan on getting a side which was large enough to share.

Bread pudding fans, rejoice! A big scoop of rich vanilla ice cream and a big square of cinnamon raisin beauty drizzled with a caramel sauce.

Overall really enjoyable and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE

We tried to go at midnight on a saturday and we were rudely told it would be a 15-20 minute wait because the waiter was overwhelmed. There were 6 people in the resturant. They advertise as a 24 hour resturant and yet you can't get food. The server is allowed to say no were not seating people and the hostess was rude. Save your money and go to the container park."}
{"text":"The $10.95 prime rib dinner was excellent. The vegetables were cooked to perfection. You also get a choice of potatoes. The mashed were average. My son enjoyed the chicken parmigiana which he thought was good. My wife thought the Cajun Chicken Alfredo was bland. For dessert I choose the ganache cake. Delicious."}
{"text":"While staying at El Cortez we had breakfast here one morning (eggs Benedict) and dinner one night (French dip). The food was fantastic and the service was lovely. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Inconsistency is the name of the game here. Portions are generous, quality is above standard coffee shop fare, and service can sometimes be amazing. But combining good food and good service appears to be a struggle to get the balance right. 

Sticks to burgers, salads, and the daily specials for a worthwhile visit."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic!! Service was extremely slow and now of the employees looked happy to be there"}
{"text":"We had a pre-wedding dinner for 12 at Siegel 1941. The food and cocktails were very good and so was the ambience. We had guests from out of town and they were impressed with the classy decor. The $10.99 prime rib special was simply wonderful. A few of us ordered it and each order came exactly as requested (medium, medium rare, or rare). The creamed horseradish was perfectly creamy and sharp.

The service at the restaurant had a few hitches. A milkshake was never delivered. The bus boy (actually gentleman) and the waiter seemed to be warring with each other. The \"bus boy\" was literally giving one of our guests serious attitude and literally did a dissing head/neck turn when asked to bring an Espresso with a \"tad of milk\".  

Despite the service glitches we and our guests had a good time. The classiness of the joint came in a a very good value/price point (for Vegas) and I do recommend coming here, albeit with some caveats."}
{"text":"Located in the historic El Cortez hotel and casino, this is a Bugsy Siegel-themed restaurant that does a good job of providing a good selection of food at reasonable prices. Their big seller is the flat iron steak that comes for $19.41. It's pretty good. They also do specials for seniors on Wednesdays, with half off meals.

The decor is kind of a throwback to classic Vegas, with photos of Mr. Siegel and the El Cortez. It's a large space, and the tables are laid out far enough apart that you're not bumping elbows with the folks at the next table over.

Service can be a little hit-or-miss. There seems to be some sort of hierarchy/pecking order at work, so if you need a refill on your iced tea it may be a virtual game of telephone between staff members until someone actually comes to your table and refills the tea."}
{"text":"Delicious Prime rib for 10.95 and the sides were delicious are well. Add a 5 dollar margarita for a drink. You will be set."}
{"text":"I came here with friends and our server barely said any words to us. Super unfriendly, and took a long time to take our order. We were done eating and basically forgotten about so we had to ask for the check. After we had paid with a card we were sitting at the table for a while waiting to get it so we could leave. I walked to the front of the restaurant, and the card was sitting right there at the front host stand with the check presenter open so that anyone could have came and picked it up and stolen the card. Food was okay. Service was poor."}
{"text":"Total trash. Do not come here. With so many other options in the immediate area, skip this shit hole. Bad food. Overpriced. Long wait. Flat out shitty. The wait staff was good and the hostesses were friendly but the food is garbage. Like dennys quality with double the price tag. Go elsewhere. Trust me."}
{"text":"Good all around and fairly priced. The bar next to the restaurant inside el Cortez is cozy and quaint. The meatballs rule."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a lunch of salmon, sauteed spinach and rice pilaf, all perfectly cooked.  There was a side of cream sauce with capers which was delicious.  Getting it half price on Senior Wednesday was a delightful surprise.  The staff were nice, fast and effecient.  I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Didn't even make it in the door!!! Pulled into the \"free\" parking lot for the El Cortez and were told $10 to park. No validation. No thanks.  Take the \"free\" off your parking sign."}
{"text":"Was really disappointed.  Basically a coffee shop with an attempt at dinner... Best bet get lunch here. Service was poor and the food lacked any skill in preparation or presentation.  Oh and did mention the service lacked the same, no skills.  Overall FAIL"}
{"text":"I love this place perfect for a last minute DInner with the fam, they service is nice n the food delicious n the prce is perfect  ."}
{"text":"Sit-down dinner type of place inside the casino that looks fancy, but is reasonably priced. Chicken strips and fries were a great late-night snack, especially to share with a friend. Prime rib dishes were huge, too. Service was quick and on par, and weren't bothered by how loud my group was being lol."}
{"text":"I kind of have a soft spot for Siegel's. The service is good and the food is good. If you play at all at the El Cortez you'll receive dining vouchers for Siegel's (because unlike strip casinos, there's no buffet); so we get to dine here semi frequently and when you can get a large, good prime rib, baked potato and veggies for $10.99 there's really not much you can complain about.

I must confess though, the only meal I've ever ordered here has been the prime rib, and it's good every time. (I've been here at least a dozen times- lol). It's kind of pathetic... each time I sit down and look over the menu like I'm going to order something else, but the prime rib is just too good a deal to pass on.

Is the food Mastro's quality? No, but you're not paying Mastro's prices either. For a little italian restaurant in a divey hipster vibe casino, this place is a solid 4 stars. 

The $5 patron margaritas are nice too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! In Old Vegas, this place is fun and interesting.  The menu had a great variety of items to try.  Of course the Prime Rib is the most inviting.  The mac n cheese was also very good. 

They will honor the Yelp check in free bottle of wine also. They let us take home the bottle since we did not finish the wine. They also give you a choice of red or white. 

Our service was very good and on point.  

It was Father's Day, so they gave my husband a ginarmous slice of the most amazing cheesecake I have ever tried.  I was super jealous.  Guess I will have to go back on Mother's Day, to get that free slice for myself. 

I love this place, it is not smoky at all and the ambiance is fun to look at."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for the awesomely cheap prime rib special. We walk through downtown LV from our hotel which was at the other end of the downtown area and once we get there, the rudest hostess tells us that we can't come in and sit because we aren't wearing a shirt with sleeves. Are you kidding me?! This place is located in downtown Las Vegas that serves a $11 prime rib special. It's not like its a 5 star restaurant.

Anyways, we ended up buying shirts next door and came back since we had walked for 30 mins to get there. When we finally got seated, we looked around and saw people in flip flops and cargo shorts. Classy stuff right there.

The best part of our experience was our server. She was so nice and sweet and she even apologized for the rude hostess. She saved the experience for us. We ended up ordering the prime rib special which comes with a baked potato, but our server let us switch it for mashed potatoes. The food itself was nothing special. My stab of meat was overcooked even though I asked for rare and my boyfriend ordered medium and it came out medium rare, so we switched. Maybe when they dropped it off they announced it wrong, but if you used your eyes then you could clearly see that it was wrong. Not really sure if we would come back here again because the food wasn't so great and pretty out of the way."}
{"text":"If you want a $28 rib eye...and nothing else. No bread, no veggies, no side salad, nothing. Just a plate with a steak on it, then this place is for you. The steak was cooked to my liking, but c'mon. The service left something to be desired. I had to ask for water to go with my carafe of wine. Oh, and a wine glass. Overall, meh."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place, as we live downtown, and are always looking for good restaurants.  Price point was right so we decided to try.  The decor is just ok, with an attempt to nod at the history, but it still had a cold, empty feeling to it.  They need a bit more drama, like adding some art on the blank white walls and i would also recommend the lower the heights of the deco lights in  the center of the room to help fill the void.   Very nice table top  and menu, i wondered if they add tablecloths at dinner service... 

Service was not great, in particular the hostess/maitre d.  No smiles, deshuvelled uniform, not remotely into doing this job. Waitress was nice but not great.

Food was ok at best, i had the chicken n waffles, which was chicken fingers on a waffle.  The gravy was good but i don't think that was really maple syrup.   Husband's eggs seemed ok but not great, and when he asked for toast, we were told it didnt say in the menu that it came with toast, but they would give us some anyway.   While i appreciate that they made this concession, i wonder who serves eggs without toast??

Don't order the cappuccino.  

I am hoping they can pull it together, we love the el cortez and would like to have more reasons to enjoy."}
{"text":"I've gone three times now to this little gem, enjoying each time.  The first was nearly a year back, to try the Monte Cristo, which I've had trouble finding.  That proved to be a tasty sandwich although not the classic battered/fried one I grew up eating.  I also had to request the preserves that should accompany it...and had to settle for strawberry as they didn't have the customary raspberry.   They have not disappointed in my two more recent visits however.  Both were breakfasts from the Wednesday 50% off for age 50+ menu.  With discount the NY Steak & Eggs cost $7.  The medium-cooked steak was reasonably tender & flavorful.  Sure, it wasn't the higher quality steak but for the normal $14 price what did you expect?   The hash browns were good and the eggs, which I eat scrambled, good.  Toast comes on the side & I took sourdough, a good match for the rest of the meal.   The waitresses have always been very friendly and eyes out  with coffee or tea refills.  Good prep time was reasonable...I didn't time it.  The atmosphere in the place is comfortable.  I do plan on returning and trying other menu items."}
{"text":"Where do I start.....

The Meal: My Mom asked me to take her for the prime rib special she has enjoyed over the years. The coffee shop is closed but we were told Siegels 1941 offers the prime rib deal. $10.95 just like before, however you need to ask for it.

Meat:The meat was perfectly rare, and was seasoned nicely they scored 10 points,  Her piece was extremely fatty and she left a pile of fat on the plate.Mine was perfect, there was enough marbling to add flavor, it was not as tender as I have had before but still good.

The Potato: The baked potato was rinsed and baked, there was no seasoning, not even salt, nor did they rub oil on it, so it was presented plain, and it was not even split. My first thought, was that it was not cooked! There was a generous amount of butter and sour cream to add taste, presentation is everything... 

The Vegetables: The green beans, carrots, and waxed beans were no better than the potato. There was no flavor, no salt, come on, at least throw garlic powder on them. My Mom asked me to taste the carrot, it was textured mush, so two bowls were returned on our plates minus one carrot each.

The Salad: I give points for the salad, it was a spring mix and the dressing was good. What ruined the salad, the bag of saltine crackers. If the bag was opened and crackers were placed on the plate the salad would look more appetizing. The looks of the plates were cafeteria

The Decor: When you first enter, you feel as though you stepped into vintage Vegas, as we sat down and as we looked around we could only shake our heads. I loved the photographs on the wall of Bugsy, the black and whites are great, the chandeliers and lighting, Sinatra and others are singing in the background and this is a nice touch.Then in the corner there is a flat screen TV with sports on, I am then looking to see where the bar is and there is none, it is so out of place.  The red booths against the wall are nice as well as the chairs that are retro, then I look at our side of the dining room and we are all sitting on wicker chairs that belong on a veranda. Order more of the elegant chairs, or if you can't get them, sell all of them and make them uniform, or cover them all in red fabric covers!. The room does have glass windows and you can see into the casino and that is nice, however I began to cough because the smoke enters in through the front of the restaurant, for that reason alone I cannot go back, I have asthma. The beautiful drapes at our table with the wicker placemats, ruins the ambiance. It is like Siegel's can't decide if it is a nice dinner spot or a coffee shop. If they change the name to Siegels Coffee Shop some of this could be forgiven. The servers have great uniforms so maybe I expected more, it just needs to decided what it wants to be, casual or elegant. If management polished what they have, Siegel's 1941 could be a gem!

The Service: Poor. We were seated and a server came by and asked what we would like to drink, then a second one came over and was asking about drinks and food, they had my Mom and I both speaking till I stopped and asked, \"Who is the server because I am not sure who to talk to since one was on the side and the other at the front. We both declined water and a few minutes later the water arrived. We both thanked the server/busser. Then came the wine. I do not expect 5 star service but when one pours from a carafe, if you lift it away from the glass it looks nicer. A busser had a quick conversation with another employee that was leaving for home at our table, so we looked at her back as they spoke. Having a better command of English without an accent would help, I had a difficult time but my Mom really struggled. Part two, the busser came by to fill the 2 inches of water my Mom did drink and my Mom said, \"No thank you\" but she continued to pour the water. I am not sure if this was a language issue, or a busser on auto pilot. The server came by to ask if we needed anything, as we said no thank you, she left before thank you came out of our mouths, pausing a moment would be a good thing. I thought for sure she would return with the bill without asking for dessert, this is a peeve of mine, if there is a check in hand I always ask to see the dessert menu, much to my delight, she asked if we would like dessert! She scored points. Training could make the dining experience very nice.

I do not like to write a negative review, I feel guilty, the El Cortez has been a favorite place to take friends from out of town to have the chance to experience old school Vegas, and the charm was lost here. I will watch other reviews and see what happens, but if it does not change, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Our group came here for dinner after a previous restaurant couldn't accommodate to my specific sensitive diet and so happy we did.  I really wish I could remember our servers name bc he was so patient with us (came in last nite, Wed around 11pm).  He definitely deserved the stellar tip I left on our small bill.  

The guys ordered their $8 burger special which included a PBR.  All the guys devoured their burgers before the beers which told me they were pretty tasty.  I ordered their 2 Eggs Any Style with no meat or toast (gluten intolerance).  I asked our server if he could do scrambled but with no dairy.  He just looked at me and I said I know (while giggling) but I can't have dairy either.  Then I laughed and said whatever way you want to make it, I'll take it!  Any style is fine but no dairy. LET ME SAY, my scrambled eggs were DELICIOUS!  Oh man they were so good I wanted more! They were so fluffy and the taste was on point.

Would definitely come back again if in the area and the El Cortez hotel has an old school gambling hall feel, not a casino."}
{"text":"The girlfriend took me to Vegas for an early birthday trip, and I picked El Cortez as our hotel, primarily for value, free parking, and location. I love steak, and was excited to read about a hidden gem steakhouse in the hotel. Sadly, it was not until I arrived that I found out it had closed; however, I heard El Cortez was building a brand new restaurant that included the top steaks from the now closed steakhouse. We ate here it's first day open, and were thrilled. The rib-eye I ordered was cooked to a perfect medium rare. I've paid more than double for the same cut at more prestigious, well known steakhouses in Vegas, and this steak was better. She ordered the steak and shrimp, which was also good. The shrimp were nice sized and grilled perfectly, and she enjoyed her medium well (a travesty if you ask me) steak.
      I was in Vegas recently and took clients here. They didn't think much of the place until they sat down and took in the decor. They enjoyed the poutine (fantastic) and their main courses. This time I got the pork chop which I also enjoyed. If the service was better I'd probably bump up the rating to a 4.5, and if they offered more variety of meat, I'd probably give them a perfect 5."}
{"text":"Dinner time for this senior couple. Plenty of seating in a wide open space. Read the menu pricey but a new establishment. Go to order nice gentleman in a tie try's to take our order. I was having a club sandwich, my husband wanted a burger. That's when the trouble started. NO SUBSTITUTIONS. We prefer to have salad with our meals instead of fries. These places do not want to accommodate diet needs. Fries , salad near the same food cost. There are plenty of places to eat in Vegas but this will not be one. Used to love El Cortez steak house. To bad."}
{"text":"While wandering around downtown Vegas on a Saturday night , my wife and I were in the mob museum gift shop . One of the staff overheard my thoughts on wanting a good meal. She advised on visiting Siegels 1941 just round the corner at the El Cortez . Had only seen pictures and heard stories bout Mr. Gaughan , but knew this place had some history . Got check it out ! 
Upon entering the El Cortez My wife and I were definitely in awe of the old school vibe that oozed the style of Vegas that lives on triumphantly on Fremont St. 
Restaurant was intimate but felt bigger than it actually was . 
On the tvs they were playing Oceans 11 (the original one !) set the vibe like a nice pair of shoes ! 
Wait staff was excellent. Very courteous and helpful .
My wife ordered a petite filet mignon with mashed potatoes and gravy with a vegetable medley . Filet was nice size and was cooked perfect! 
I went in for the chicken parmigiana with spaghetti. This was the best I have ever had !
Chicken breast was nice size and the sauce was a second only to my wife's  (She's Italian , not gonna tick her off!)
Meal was well priced and prepared. 
Old school and vibe rules all the time ! 
Thank you Siegels 1941 at the El Cortez , will see ya again next time we're in Vegas"}
{"text":"No clue why people hate on this place. 

11 prime rib was huge and delicious. 

Also had a burger that was great!

All in with drinks and tip for 2, 37 bucks. Can't beat that.

If you're in the area and hungry check it out."}
{"text":"A nice surprise $10 prime rib special. Served 24 hours a day. It hit the spot.  Downtown Las Vegas is a must see."}
{"text":"Always a wait and the they seem to never have enough staff. The food is just ok for the price be careful what you order. Also seems that there is a very different dress code for men vs. women, ok for the women to where jeans and tank top but not the men?? The hostess always seem to be overwhelmed and there is a wait with empty tables. The daily specials run out very quick as they never seem to make enough.. Overall they don't care about return customers just taking advantage of the visitors. Not the best value by far."}
{"text":"Sadly, had to walk out. The special 10oz steak looked good. We wanted to be seated somewhere else, but no server. Didn't seem like anyone knew what was going on."}
{"text":"The only reason I go here is they give me a 2-1 every month and then a free food coupon every once in a while.  To make up for all the free food they charge ways to much for what they serve.  You think when you get a coupon for $20 that your going to get a great meal for two, but that is just a sandwich.  I \"won\" a $50 voucher from one of there contests, I was able to get 2 drinks, a daily special and an upgraded burger and 2 deserts.  The food is the chefs take on things and every time I get something new there is a \"what is this\" moment.  Like we got a house salad, but it was a lot of greens and not iceberg, so it didn't get eaten.  It seems every time I've been here (5 times) that someone gets something that doesn't get eaten or sent back because it is so different then what was expected.  Even with a 2-1 is seems to be a questionable value."}
{"text":"Siegel's 1941 is in the El Cortez hotel and is a brand new concept.  It was lively and bright.  It's open 24/7, so we went for an early dinner.  We were greeted promptly and pleasantly. Our waitress was friendly and helpful with the menu and wine list.  We loved the shrimp cocktail, it was chilled well and the shrimp were cooked perfectly.  My husband and I both had delicious steaks, but the stand out of the meal was the scalloped potatoes.  They were awesome!!  (and I rarely eat carbs or cheese).  All in all, I enjoyed our entire dining experience and cannot wait to go back to try other delicious looking things on their menu."}
{"text":"Perhaps the most aspiring downtown hotel dining project in recent memory, and one that instantly sparked interest given the 24/7 concept within the historic El Cortez, it was with three friends that a four-course feast was enjoyed at Siegel's 1941, the sizeable space and immense menu showing promise of great things to come despite only officially being open for five days at the time of our mid-morning arrival.

Inspired by Bugsy Siegel, an early investor in the El Cortez, with a soundtrack that veers vintage as Rat Pack classics float beneath gilded ceilings overhead, Siegel's 1941 features several touches harkening the era for which it is themed and with Virginia Hill gazing on over wood and red leather the menu is wide-reaching with breakfast, 'all-day,' and late-nite versions offered depending on the time, the transition from breakfast occurring at 11:00am proving the impetus for the party's 10:15am reserved table.

Managed by Scott Farber and conceptualized by ESPLV, a design group behind several local restaurants with varying degrees of value, it would seem obvious that a concept as aggressive as Sigel's 1941 would be marred by a few issues in its opening days, and fully admitting that staff/kitchen transitions are one of those 'kinks' it was no-doubt a pleasant surprise that saw Scott diligently looking over his team throughout the stay, a middle-aged Hispanic woman providing almost universally impressive service given the complex coursing of the order, while a few kitchen delays and errors in execution seemed a bit more egregious - the chicken sent in place of requested eggplant, while a side of meatballs was instead served as the spaghetti centered entrée with a whole lot of watery noodles eventually going to waste.

Beginning with breakfast, a few cups of coffee as well as orange juice, milk, plus a cocktail all brought along with water with refills rarely requiring a request, course one saw four plates delivered and while the flaccid pancakes with a simple spread of nutella could have benefitted from a bit more imagination both the chicken and waffles beneath peppery sausage gravy and the challah French Toast were as good as any served within a local diner, the use of 100% pure maple syrup a definite highlight, as was the quality of house-made corned beef acting to anchor a hash that featured golden-brown potatoes and lightly seared red peppers alongside a pair of poached eggs.

Designating round two as 'the sandwich course,' it was on the advice of EatingLV that 'the city's best Cuban' was ordered, and served with fries on a silver tray one would be hard pressed to argue with such an assessment, particularly as relates to authenticity, as each ingredient melded nicely between layers of toasty pressed bread, the 'Monte Cristo' equally tasty and loaded with ham despite missing an opportunity to be the only deep-fried version currently offered in Sin City while the 'Carolina' pulled pork was unfortunately quite dreadful, a total lack of vinegar in either the pig or the slaw not at all resembling the stuff served in the Southeast while the bun was a soggy mess mere seconds after arrival.

Receiving repeat apologies for a delay that stretched just under forty minutes at the midpoint of the meal, it was almost as though the extra time only served to confuse the kitchen since the aforementioned mistakes were sent out despite being correctly listed on the ticket, but thankfully not meeting any harboring a distaste for animal flesh as the enormous chicken parmesan was an exceedingly high quality rendition with light breading and good sauce while meatballs were unfortunately a bit dry and almost entirely devoid of spice, the pot pie undoubtedly proving a far more worthwhile bite as golden puff pastry formed a buttery dome over a creamy potage chockablock full of chicken and vegetables that outdid many more expensive versions found elsewhere in Sin City.

Not yet dialing in the dessert menu, and as such unable to offer the Strawberry Ice Box Pie while also admitting that breakfast pastries are currently brought in from an outside source, the meal conclude with a duo of Bread Pudding and Turtle Pie, the former a dense block of brioche swimming in bourbon infused sauce beneath slowly melting ice cream while the later was an absolute must-order for those fancying caramel or chocolate, the filling a spot-on rendition of the inspirational candy with a graham cracker crust crisp too the tooth and heavy with spice.

Already rivaling anything downtown for 24-hour fare, and only likely to get better with time, Siegel's 1941 is the sort of retro-rebrand that places such Roxy's at the Stratosphere have long aspired to emulate - a place where tourists and locals alike can get a good meal at a fair price, all while experiencing the old-school Vegas vibe that flows throughout its longest continuously running hotel and gaming space."}
{"text":"Must order the mac & cheese, it's the best I have ever tasted. The menu is great, even late night some very good deals to be had!"}
{"text":"Replacing the classic Cafe Cortez, Siegel's 1941 is the El Cortez's attempt at modernizing things in the otherwise vintage \"Old Vegas\" hotel.  The menu boasts a good assortment of appealing options including the tasty Bugsy Burgers (I had mine with a fried egg and cheddar) and nice salads.  The coffee, by the way, is more bitter than one would like.

Our experience with the service, however, was terrible.  Our waitress, Luba, was completely inept.  She had little knowledge of the menu and possesses poor table side manners.

The kitchen, which took some time to get our food out, got half of our order wrong.  My burger came out just fine, but my girlfriend's salad came out as a noodle dish.  That's not even close and she was very much not happy.

We're Las Vegas locals and would like to come back seeing as we enjoy the hotel and the food, but that waitress all but ruined the place for us.  We'll give it one more try, but if Luba is our waitress again we'll leave without ordering."}
{"text":"So, we stayed at the hotel and called to place a phone order and was told that we could not place a phone order for pick up and that they do not have room service. I clarified with the lady that all we wanted to do was place the order over the phone and then head down stairs to pick it up. Apparently, we couldn't do that and she really didn't have an answer for me. 

So, we went down stairs, hung the hell over with our pj's on and totally out of it, LOL! to place our order. We ordered a pastrami sandwich, matzo ball soup and a regular hamburger, medium cooked and bacon. Well, we get back up to the room, which felt like a million years later and find out the hamburger was cooked to a crisp and no bacon. We even paid for the extra bacon. We were already burnt out and didn't go downstairs to correct it either. Kind of disappointed too since I had high hopes since we always stay at the El Cortez, you win some, you lose some, right?"}
{"text":"Prime rib special for $10.95. Apple cobbler was tiny, like one bite and Abra cadabra gone!!!  I may come back for the prime rib....nothing else. The restaurant is nice and pretty but don't be fooled, the potato they gave me with my prime rib was small and wrinkled.  Nothing to see here."}
{"text":"A surprisingly amazingly awesome breakfast/brunch spot inside a casino. The waitresses are super friendly and very attentive. I got the smoked salmon breakfast and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Awful service for the second time! The fist time I had the rudest waiter with absolutely no personality and the second time I waited forever for everything! I waited to be seated in a close to empty restaurant because the host was MIA, I waited forever for my drink order, waited forever for the waitress to take my order, waited for my appetizer (which was served cold with my food) and was confronted with an attitude when I chased the busser down who kept passing my table by, to ask for a refill. They should really rename this place THE WAIT! needles to say, I will not return for this cold food, rude staff and long wait time!"}
{"text":"I don't know why third are only 3 stars rated. Based on the breakfast my wife and I just had and the service this place deserves nothing less than 5 stars."}
{"text":"Decided to try out Siegel's after discovering the café was closed. Found the service to be on par and friendly,  albeit a little slow.  Nice and pleasant atmosphere (like the mobster vibe).

Ordered the Lucky Luciano burger which was cooked to a nice medium with marinara sauce, mozzarella on a ciabatta roll.  Italian all the way; appropriate for a burger named after a mobster. Liked that it was served on a metal tray--like in the \"joint\" Haha. 

Was really disappointed by the very small sized wings; $10 is a bit steep considering they weren't even very good. 

Overall, a pretty good experience and will stop back when at the El Cortez."}
{"text":"The classic association between old mobsters and retro Vegas finally gets a good turn. Situated in the classic El Cortez, Bugsy Siegal gets a reworking as an inexpensive retro restaurant.

We were there for their second night, very near a couple who sent their order all back; the man had a steak he didn't like (it cut and ran nicely in front of me), the lady had \"overcooked\" vegetables. We had the burgers: delivered on better than average lightly floured buns with sauted onions, a nice deal for about eight bucks! You HAVE to give places time to shake out the kinks; maybe we just got lucky. Burgers, fries, slaw, sodas: bada-bing.

The soundtrack was vintage; the score is understated and nicely done. It's a LOT safer than anything in the downtown area, so relax there; it's a spot that you won't overpay at, and more power to 1941 for bringin' on pastrami, a reuben and easy eats.

PS: I know some locals are pissed about the old diner goin' out and a slick mobster eatery goin' in. I get that, but downtown's infamous for chancy chow; Siegal's 1941 is hip and pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Went for lunch the other day with five friends we all had prime rib, it was amazing and reasonably priced! Paula was one of the best waitresses I've had in a long time at any restaurant... Thank you for the great service."}
{"text":"I reeeeeeaaallllly wanted to love this place because the menu looked good. Lots of variety.....but......I didn't care for it.

Here's why.

I thought the chicken and waffles description sounded wonderful. Fresh floured, crispy chicken breast, fluffy waffle, maple syrup and sausage gravy on the side. Yum. Imagine my disappointment when my plate arrived and it was a few chicken tenders. Yes, frozen chicken tenders that you would see on a kids menu. Meh.......

My boyfriend ordered his eggs over medium. I swear, no one in Vegas knows how to make eggs. His eggs were very snotty, very runny and no where close to a semi solid yolk like they should be. 

Service was good in the beginning, then dropped off and began to suffer. We didn't even have a chance to ask for different eggs.   She was nice, but didn't check on us much. 

We had to wait a long time for our bill as well. 

I don't think I'll be back and we love El Cortez."}
{"text":"We came here because we won a $50 voucher from  a El Cortez Casino drawing. If it's not for that I'll probably never come here. 

The food is decent but not great - we ordered fried calamari as appetizer which the calamari wasn't very chewy or fresh, batter was kind of apart from the calamari. We had a ribeye steak ($28) that came with no side, so I add grilled asparagus for $7 which felt like a ripe off at this diner. But I needed some ornaments for my yelp picture so oh well.. and another shrimp scampi pasta as entree. Both dishes is lack of flavor but I was just glad my medium rare was at least on point.

So the worst part about this place is the service. Took the busser a while to ask us what to drink, and forever for the server to come take the order when it was not busy at all at the restaurant. After the meal came until we finished the server never came to check the table and just took our dishes away without politely asking if we're finished first. Then we had to asked him to refill water and of course he told the busser to do so, but busser didn't even remember our water was no ice with lemon. And the server forgot to deduct the voucher while we already told him in the beginning we are using voucher as partial payment. These are all basic knowledge and respect to customers but none of them is putting their heart at work which made us really disappointed.

I would say there's no reason for me to return, although I was interested on the prime rib special for $10.95.. so maybe someday if I end up at El Cortez with hungry stomach I'll reconsider again."}
{"text":"Okay. I was in Las Vegas. It was my first night there. It was about ten O'clock, and I was exploring Fremont Street. I had JUST had a slice of pizza and beer at Evel Pie down the street. As I was walking back, my eyes caught sight of a huge banner that read \"10.99 Prime Rib!\" And for some inexplicable reason. I suddenly really wanted prime rib.  I guess I'm just a sucker for advertising.
    I got sucked into the casino. The El Cortez? I think? I meandered around looking for the restaurant. I found one of the bars, and moved on. No signs for Prime Rib there. I passed the pizza joint. Nope. No Prime Rib there either. Then I got to Siegel's. It seemed fancy. It seemed pretty upscale. It seemed really nice. No way this is the place? 
      \"Is this the place?\" 
      \"Yes. This is the place.\" 
      \"Okay. One please!\"
   I was quickly lead to a table and a cute waitress swung by for my order. I let her know I wanted $10.99 Prime Rib. Not quite still fully believing it myself. She smiled, nodded and asked about my drink. I hadn't had water all day, and I figured it was a good a time as any to keep up the hydration. Plus, I just really wanted to pay $10.99 for the Prime Rib. But cute waitress got a tip too. Nowhere on the menu does it say '$10.99 Prime Rib\" Hence my confusion. But if you ask for it....they've got it.
    On the TV's were playing I think the original Ocean's 11.  (No, not that one.  The actual 1960's original one) That somehow seemed appropriate here. After a lil while of trying to figure out what the heck I was watching, the prime rib showed up. Holy Crap! $10.99 Prime Rib is awesome! I was starved all of a sudden.
     Thick juicy tender steak. Mound of french fries. Bowl of carrots, and two different ramekins of sauce to dip things into? I think I love you $10.99 Prime Rib Special. I tore into the steak and ate it as lovingly as I could.  I tried to save it. Enjoy it as long as I could. But it was gone before too long. I used the horseradish and au jus sauce with the fries. (So very Good.) 
  

    So ya. Total was about $15. So a pretty cheap second dinner. Thanks Siegel's for $10.99 Prime Rib Special. It was magical. I'll definitely stop in on my next trip out your way for it."}
{"text":"I like the place but Worst service ever , never came back again, hostess lady on graveyard very rude , waiter he left the place with out telling us, and took so long to bring  the food, is a alot options around , avoid this place ."}
{"text":"This place is so good. The portions are huge at reasonable prices. The staff are hard workers and the place's ambiance is spot on. I cannot wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Went there for the stone crab and enjoyed the stone crab but not the sides so much.  Has an impressive menu but food is not like a gourmet room restaurant in a hotel.  Prices and service are decent.  I would recommend staying with the meats and comfort foods."}
{"text":"Delicious Prime Rib Dinner at Siegel 1941 for less than $12.. Very Large Portions & very Favorful.  Somehow, I consumed the majority of this meal when it could have been a meal for 2.. Cool Red Leather Booth sitting was comfy..."}
{"text":"The prime rib was fairly tasty but before we ordered the waiter said oh let me get you some bread, then after we ordered the special, I  asked for bread and he said it was on request, he said he thinks they ran out and goes bavk and returns..yea theres no bread. Bs. A woman came with rolls.. im very upset.. not so much I didmt get rolls but it made me feel like because I  ordered the special I didnt get bread. Bad business."}
{"text":"We go to Vegas a couple times a year, and are a young 60's couple. This restaurant was very fairly priced, and the theme is entertaining. To say it's decor is from the 40's is a little misleading. It's more like cafeteria style, a little loud, but has huge BW prints on the walls, which we liked. There are a couple TV monitors that play gangster movies, which is cute. The menu is named after historical mobsters (The Lucky Luciano Burger) which we also liked. You can get a good burger for $10. They also serve breakfast, so we'll go back next time for that."}
{"text":"Stayed at El Cortez for the first time recently, and after a late concert and a lot of drinking my friend needed some late night (early morning) grub... bad!... so we went in Siegels.  I didn't feel particularly hungry but thought I'd get a little bite of something and somehow turned it into ordering a full meal vs bite.  I got the chicken parmigiana.  It was huge!  And A-B-S-O-L-U-T-E-L-Y  DELICIOUS!!  The sauce, the chicken, the noodles, the bread... everything was excellent!!!  My mouth is watering just looking at the picture.   I chowed down on more of that than I care to admit and took the rest up to my room which luckily had a fridge.  The next morning (ie, a few hours later) it was time to check out of the room and I couldn't bare to toss that meal but there was no microwave. I thought I'd just look at it (ha) and then I saw it and smelled it and... couldn't resist and took a bite (haha)... and another and another.. man I couldn't stop. 
 Even COLD it was still delicious!  Clearly, I highly recommend this dish and I'm so excited to be going back next month and I am FOR SURE getting it again!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times only to give it another chance but this by far was the worst experience we went on a Wednesday for dinner we sat for more then 5 min then asked to be moved to a different section since no one ever approached us. We finally got a server he took our order kinda impressed no paper got it to the t . Our food came out and he went on break really 2 nd time that happened and it was busy  we were forgotten but had our bill we wanted desert flagged someone down and we all ordered desert my son got a brown cow similar to a float and sucked a piece of meat through the straw disgusting .I showed the busser who went and got a women who took the item then never came back. Wtf I tried to get the hostess attention and she walked 2 x by never stopped and mubbled  something just rude . Finally I had a manager approach me said he was sorry and took it off the bill ..and said else do u want me to do I said first of all your people r rude and act as if they don't want to be bothered again apology ...bad service  bad management won't give it another chance ...diago or rigo the manager train your staff properly. Unsatisfied"}
{"text":"On a recent visit to this mob-decorated casual restaurant, all food was of high quality except for crumbly cold complimentary rolls.  Vegetable Egg Rolls were crispy and very good, and Shrimp Chow Mein featuring large tail-on shrimp was good and tasty.  Service was efficient and good, as well.

This time XXX-1/2 overall!"}
