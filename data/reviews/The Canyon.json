{"text":"We went here over 4th of July weekend to watch the UFC fight. This place has a great concept and nice environment. However, the food is TERRIBLE. If you liked the food when it was FOX Sports Grill, then you will still like the food., as the menu is not much different and the food is of the same poor quality---it comes out within 5-10 minutes of ordering and tastes as if food was cooked hours earlier and was just reheated in the microwave (it probably was!). Food = worse than Chili's. Very pre made, very over salted and preserved, very not good.   My husband and I both agreed that if the food tasted better, we would come here more often to watch football and the fights. Maybe we would consider checking out the live music, but we can not bear the thought of paying for such terrible food again."}

{"text":"Went here with friends last week; the first any of us had seen it since it changed to The Canyon. It's clear they are in the process of making this place more music friendly - with the decor and entertainment.   The food was pretty good and service was good for us too. We went on a Friday night to watch a Bon Jovi tribute band. As far as the music; the sound seemed to be a bit off but I would expect that as they learn how the sound system works and tweak it a bit it'll improve. The band did a great job at entertaining us for sure... dressed the part and made an effort to get the crowd involved.   We had a fun night out with friends; maybe spent a little too much for drinks but ah well - it was worth it."}
{"text":"What has been formally known as Fox Sports Grill has now been renewed into The Canyon Club - \"Where music meets the soul.\"  This venue transforms nicely into the goals of The Canyon Club.  Three 10 foot projection screens, extremely large bar area, ample seating, as well as an area for live music, enables The Canyon Club to cater to it's mission on bringing live music, sport event viewing, and great food to Scottsdale.    Their menu boasts a nice selection of appetizers, along with sandwiches, burgers, salads, and complete entrees.   Happy Hour is available Monday-Friday from 3-6 p.m.   Their grilled chicken sandwich is made to your liking with toppings of your choosing, besides their standard fare.  Most of their menu items come with your choice of cole slaw, French fries or sweet potato fries.  For an additional charge, you can substitute the side for a salad or soup of the day.  The grilled chicken sandwich is tasteful and of large size on a soft Kaiser roll.    If you crave more meat, their Prime Rib Dip on onion bread is a stomach pleaser, complete with caramelized onions and plenty of juicy beef!  The Canyon Club has a bright future ahead here in Scottsdale.  Two California locations have already performed successfully, and now they aim to please here in Scottsdale.  With live music and televisions enough for any sports fan, The Canyon Club will be able to cater to most anyone's interests, be it sporting or music.  I look forward to seeing what live acts come into The Canyon Club in the future, as well as sampling the rest of their menu!

{"text":"This was an amazing place! We visited on 80's night, featuring the band The Spazmatics. Incredible facilities, very good food, great service, amazing, fun night!! We will continue to not only visit The Canyon, but are hosting a party there in the near future, and will definitely recommend it to many others."}
{"text":"Bartender here was very friendly.  We came in on a Wednesday night and I believe it was still happy hour ($2 Coors Light).  I think it would be fun to come here on a weekend.  They now have a \"music theme\" and have bands here.  Rock Lobster (excellent 80s cover band) is playing here soon.  It's a very nice facility that used to be Fox Sports Grill.  I think that the biggest problem is the location.  It's about a mile away from Scottsdale Quarter (We walked it and it wasn't fun in summer heat).  I guess if you lived at Pillar across the street then it would be great."}
