{"text":"Is this real life?  

They asked me if I wanted my chocolate truffles in a bag or a box,  and since this was a delicate dessert,  I asked for it in a box. 

When I got home I realized they charged me $0.50 for 'AAA' box. Never did the staff say anything about how it would cost extra to choose plastic over paper. 

We're not talking a nice Tiffany's gift box, it's just a clear, plastic, typical,  run-of-the-mill restaurant establishment to go box! It's not even meant for reuse. 

...Oh yeah,  the truffles were unremarkable;  tasted like margarine,  and had the texture of lard. 

I can overlook the upcharge for a to go container if the food made up for this lack of business sense, but the truffles or other of my orders failed to impress me."}
{"text":"I was at East Towne Mall today and being a warm day a smoothie sounded like a good idea. So I came across Belle Pizzelle and ordered a strawberry smoothie. Little did I know the series of disasters I was in for. The first attempt consisted of about 3 strawberries and lots of ice and water. It was a watery pink color and cold but that's the only positive thing I can say about it. It was a nearly tasteless but sort of sweetish watery ice slush. Not quite sure how this was worth $4.50. Or couId be called a smoothie.  I tasted it and immediately commented that it had no taste and asked for my money back. But the attendant offered to try again using ice cream (?? was I getting a strawberry milkshake but hey that would be an improvement) so I agreed. In the meantime someone else ordered a strawberry smoothie so we both stood there watching the comedy act to follow. 2 plastic cupfulls of what looked like hard vanilla ice cream, 6 tiny strawberries (yes we counted) and more ice and water. But unfortunately this new concoction wouldn't blend in the blender so more and more water was added until it sort of blended with lots of poking inside the blender cup to dislodge the mess inside. 2 people were now working on it. This was then put in cups and served to us. One taste and I nearly spit it out. Imagine extremely watered down ice cream with ice chunks and no strawberry taste whatsoever. Refund next and left.  Very sad. Hopefully their other menu items are an improvement or it's impossible to see how this place would be in business. Would highly recommend a new smoothie recipe!!"}
{"text":"The kid working the counter barely looked up from his phone to help us. The $2.50 snowman sugar cookie was a rock. The 3 for $5 cookies we bought were nothing to write home about. Feel like I got taken by the fact that this place was in the mall next to the play area. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic service & fantastic food.  In a mall.

Don't let the unusual location fool you.  This place is legit. Fresh ingredients, house made soups, delicious cookies.  I will go to the dreaded mall again just to eat there."}
{"text":"I revisited this little gem today. It was empty. The restaurant definitely needs signage and increased word of mouth . It is rare to find fresh food at a mall . Delicious soup, sandwiches and baked goods. It is a quiet spot away from the food court. 
I tried the homemade borscht which was fabulous. There was tender pieces of beef along with some greens and the beets. I also had the pelmeni again!
I discussed with the owners that my friends include Jews and Muslims who do not eat pork . I learned that their homemade pirogi has a vegetarian filling and is made with same noodle as the pelmeni. I plan to try that next time . 
Please spread the word and support this oasis in a good food desert ."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I thought it was unusual and interesting. I got the veggie pelmeni (potato dumplings) and loved them and had a White Zombie latte and LOVED it. It is very strange to see a place like this (independent, different food, also a bakery that does catering) in a place like East Towne Mall. 

I hope this place makes it. The lady working there was very nice, and I want to come back soon and sample something (anything!) from the bakery case. 

If you're at East Towne and in search of something to eat, check this place out. They have other things, too, sandwiches and maybe soft tacos or something? I forgot - I was dazzled by the dumplings."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! The next time I need to bring a dessert for a party, I am coming here to get it. Love the sandwiches too! WOW!"}
