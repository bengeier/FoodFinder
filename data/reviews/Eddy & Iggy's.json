{"text":"This place is bro central, which cost it one full star. The last time I went here the entire bar was empty, but the whole place smelled like a urinal cake. Minus another star. SO...on its best day I'd give it 3 stars. The food isn't anything special and I don't remember there being a great beer selection. Also, I didn't go to a Catholic high school so I think the whole idea is pretty lame anyways. Apparently most of the bros that frequent this place did and think its great. The'll probably buy those new \"Brohio\" t-shirts that I think are horrible and wear them to karaoke on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this bar yet? I go here all the time! I love that they do karaoke pertty much all the time. It gets really busy on weekends but never so crowded that it's annoying or anything. The bartenders are all really nice. It's not the cheapest bar in the area but it's not expensive either. It's always clean and has pretty decent food, as well! My friends and I end up here a lot because it's just an all around solid bar."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good beer selection, and tasty food. I would recommend this Bar for a couple of good beers or possibly a date night."}
{"text":"I love E&I for one thing and one thing alone.
KEVIN KELLIOKE on Thursday nights.  
You never know who you're going to see, or WHAT you're going to hear.
Plus you can get a quick bite and enjoy a beer while you watch the show...."}
{"text":"Friendly & helpful staff, convenient location, and awesome decor are three great things about this place. They have a unique list of drinks called \"poptails\" for those who liked mixed drinks with sodas. With plenty of beer options, this place has it all. If you visit, you have to try the deep-fried donuts. They are chocolate donuts with peanut butter deep fried in waffle batter. Best dessert in Cleveland if not all of Ohio!!"}
{"text":"Typical neighborhood bar. Beer selection was not horrible.  They have some home brews there as well. They give their recipe to a brewer, they are not a brewery.

We ordered burgers. Weird, the bacon on the bacon burger is IN the burger. Different, not bad. 

Our bartender (Jenny), was very nice and did a great job.

The place is named after St. Ignatius and St. Ed's. Cute idea, filled with football memorabilia from both schools. 

I will probably go back."}
{"text":"I went on a super crowded Tuesday trivia/karaoke night and was told it isn't usually so full. I like when bars have activities, and it was a good time. The crowd was interesting. Everyone seemed like they had had their 21st birthday within the week. I usually think of ATC as the youngest bar in Lakewood, but this definitely takes the cake. With that said, maybe it was a goofy night. I'll go again for sure. All the memorabilia was cute, I'm sure the collection will grow. 

And if you are a wine drinker like this girl, don't be discouraged by the tiny wine bottles behind the bar, they have the real stuff in the basement, just ask!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Saturday night, and really enjoyed it.  BIG step up from Cronies, though I was sad to see they got rid of the stripper pole. Oh wait, no I wasn't!  Anyway, we were pleasantly surprised by this place.  We met some friends for drinks, and found a generally late 20s crowd, and some nice bartenders.  The karaoke was...well amusing, and the beer list was impressive.  I will say my fiance attempted to order several different beers and they were out of all of them.  Why wouldn't you make sure you were stocked on stuff for a Saturday night?  It wasn't even late!  But all the same, a generally pleasant experience.  I would go back, for sure."}
{"text":"I can not say anything for the food, I've never had it.  I love going to Eddy & Iggy's because of their consistent karaoke offerings.  I believe karaoke is every night.  During the weekends it can get packed rather quickly.

Drink selection is typical of a Lakewood establishment.  Their addition of a side patio last summer was a superb idea!

They also have several tvs and a big screen projector.  I've watched a couple of different sporting events here with pleasure."}
{"text":"Fun place to enjoy a game, some cocktails and karaoke.  Everyone was very friendly.  I will definately visit again when in the area!  I have been told that the food is good, but I didn't have anything.  I was there for Wednesday night karaoke.  The host was great!!  And there were a bunch of good singers the night I was there.  Drink prices are really cheap!  The Apple Pie Moonshine is a must try."}
{"text":"Not a bad place.  Came here for a wing crawl.  The wings were solid.  Flavors not exotic or anything.  Got served super quick.  Drinks are cheaper than a lot of other bars!  Kind of a frat/jock bar...fooseball table..guys drinking Bud Lt out of alluminum cans..lol.  Hillarious how there is so much of these types of dudes in Lakewood..  Its like a college town..without the college.."}
{"text":"So, for those of you reading this and only seeing one review. This is for you:

This place DOES exist. They have Karaoke on Thursday nights!

The crowd here is your late 20's early 30's for the most part. The tenders are really nice people.

This is kinda your semi-upscale sports bar with low prices!

If you are into cheap beer, this is also a great option with miller high lifes for a buck (sometimes, all the time, I'm not sure).

if you are nearby here this would make a great watering hole!"}
{"text":"My last couple experiences at Eddy and Iggy's have not been so great :( I mean, the last time I was there there was a TACK in my water! How does that even happen? They changed the trivia dude and he was pretty rude to my team so we just left. Please go back to the way things were!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend turned me on to the place after she found out how much I love karaoke.  It's a small spot in what I consider to be the trendier part of Lakewood.  I've been twice and the crowd seems to be more mature young professionals late 20's early 30's. It's not a rowdy bar either.  Conversation is just above a rumble and laughter and cheers abound.  But we were there for karaoke, and they never disappoint. The sound system is great and the dj's are alot of fun. Its not at all unusual to see them dance to a tune they like or even chime in with some backup. Thats what I like in a karaoke dj. I hate when the djs act like they're doing you a favor to come out and play these songs for you.  At Ed & Iggy's you're gonna hear alot of the 90's, top 40 hits, and of course the  classic karaoke tunes but everyone is really encouraging. There isn't any booing or heckling or anything like that, just folks out for a drink and ready to belt out drunken versions of their favorite songs.  Their regular dj is a guy called Mufasa but I guess he's indisposed the entire month of Sept. (I heard he caught a case y'all!) So, their was another guy whose name I didn't get. He was alot of fun, very high energy and very enthusiatic....he's filling in for Mufasa. I'd like to try make it down there before he moves and and find out where else he djs. He was very fair about the rotation also. I got there around 11pm on Saturday night and put in my cards and I sang twice before it ended at 2. Pretty much everyone got to sing if they put in a card, whereas I only sang once with Mufasa and I got there at 10 and several of his \"crew\" sang multiple times so * side eye* to Mufasa on that one. But I only sang with him once so I'm going to withhold judgment on that one until I see if this was an unusual thing or if this is how he regularly runs his rotation. I'm interested in checking out the trivia!"}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland last night and looking for karaoke, the staff at the restaurant where we had dinner suggested Eddie and Iggy's and we are grateful for the recommendation!!! The karaoke host was awesome and we had a great time!!!"}
{"text":"Of course I like this place!  I'm Asian, and they have karaoke on Friday and Saturday nights!  I'm genetically predetermined to love karaoke, and their selection is amazing!  They have both new and old songs!  They have a decent selection of craft brews and offer specials on local brews. Who doesn't love to support the local community, while having a good time!

Tip #1: put your karaoke songs in early because this place gets busy!  The DJ is excellent and will spread your choices throughout the night that way one person is not singing for 3 songs in a row. He knows how to do it right!

Tip #2: boy band songs are a huge hit here... So learn it and love it lol"}
