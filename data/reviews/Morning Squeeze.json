{"text":"I went to Morning Squeeze for the first time today. I really liked it! The booth was comfy, the decor is colorful, cheery and hip, and the staff was friendly. I had the Scottsdale breakfast burrito, which had egg whites, potatoes, spinach, and tomatoes inside. It was served with a side of fruit. The portion size was perfect, and the food was very good. The waitress kept my iced tea filled and the manager stopped by twice to make sure everyone was happy. The menu is huge, so everyone in my party had lots of choices. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible and the food was mediocre.  The wait was long (despite beating the bro-crowd on the weekend) and the waitress seemed confused and overwhelmed.  I think she was schizophrenic.  After 30 minutes she tells us that the cook had messed up one of our orders so we had to wait another 15 minutes.  I ordered a veggie omelette and it was cold and stale (including the toast).  Nothing spectacular for my taste buds.  My friend's Egg's Benedict was cooked horribly wrong, i.e., the eggs were hard-boiled.  And it wasn't covered with any hollandaise sauce but instead what appeared to be a streak of brown gravy.  I hope it was gravy. This place is in the heart of old-town and I was expecting great food by talented chefs.  I'd choose Randy's over Morning Squeeze, unless they improve soon."}
{"text":"I got the sqeezemobile....pretty good, needed more cream cheese I thought. And my husband got the NY Steak and eggs...good as well, he said the eggs were really good!"}
{"text":"We ate here after the the yelp local shopping crawl for the sunset brunch, so I have no idea what the prices are. However the Mimosas were poured strong, the bacon and sausage delicious, and the eggs Benedict perfect."}
{"text":"super cute and healthy menu. i love the atmosphere and how it opens up to the outside!"}
{"text":"Went on a weekday and food/service was great. We were hesitant bec of other negative reviews, but we had no problems and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"always drove by here and always wanted to try , but i regret it! will never return! the food is overly priced and i had to return my food how disgusting it was after waiting forever for it to arrived. i literally paid 29$ for two waffle and two coffee!! and the service was worst (machele) was our server! dogs are allowed on the patio.. but i didnt expect to see dogs sitting around the bar i was shocked! And employees playing with dogs without even washing hands and serving food!!! Thats just disgusting !!!"}
{"text":"I am very glad we gave the Morning Squeeze a second chance. The first time was very subpart, service was slow and inattentive. The food was cold and not very good, burned eggs and toast. This time was just the opposite, food was great and Brianna our waitress was very nice and on very attentive even with a packed restaurant."}
{"text":"I got breakfast on St. Patty's day here, and it was awesome. The whole place is green inside so on St. Patty's day having everyone dressed in green as well was a bit intense. I got french toast and bacon, and that's exactly what I got. No goofy toppings or weird concoctions, just a picture perfect breakfast."}
{"text":"Sat us super fast but food took more than 30 min to arrive. Crazy!!!! Never again!  Breakfast Club is better and speedy!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for awhile! This place recently changed their menu and it is amazing! The farm out omelette and breakfast tacos are my favs. They also have a full bar, which for a breakfast place is pretty amazing!"}
{"text":"The ambience was nice but the food was disappointing. My eggs were under cooked, turkey sausage was bone dry, and the French toast was burnt to a crisp! They served it with the burnt side down to hide the error, but one bite made me realize they tried to sneak one past me. I flipped it over and sure enough it was charred black...Nothing about my experience here was positive besides the company of my sweetheart. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Service was severely lacking and the food was marginal at best. To be honest we only came here because it had the shortest wait of all the restaurants nearby. You're better off just waiting it out to get in somewhere else."}
{"text":"We went there expecting a wait because the bloody Mary's are good but once we got say it took about 10 minutes for someone to greet us, 10 minutes for our drinks, 10 minutes to get out order take, and 40 minutes from that point until out food got to out table. A couple sat about 20 minutes after us and got their food 30 minutes before us. The manager talked to them and apologized for the wait but ignored us even though we had waited about 30 minutes to order food and  70 minutes from the time we sat down to actually eat.  I am disappointed and I would not recommend anyone to return.  The service was sad and the food was not  tasty enough to compensate for the timing and server attitude."}
{"text":"Fun location.  Breakfast food was average.    Pitaya bowl was very good!  House made granola was excellent.  Ask for extra.  Service was slow so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Awedome food, great staff! Friendly feeing when you walk into this place. Staff is always kind and smiling and helpful, food is some of the best breakfasts I've had in awhile. Great job guys."}
{"text":"I don't often give bad reviews, but my group and I had a horrible first experience here. Our server was painfully slow, acted pretty stuck up, and never checked on us. At one point I got a filthy drinking glass. Our server didn't come back in a timely fashion after dropping the glass on the table and so thankfully a busser overheard me mention to my friend that I was grossed out by it. He retrieved me a new one. We were charged for the dirty one too though. None of our food came out at the same time and one of my friends was left sitting there with no food after we all had ours. When eating his food after it finally came out, he found half of an EGGSHELL in it. Another friend of mine took the plate directly to the manager to make him aware of what had happened and the manager took the plate to the back. He returned a few mins later with the same plate with the eggshell just taken off (we know because my friend had eaten some watermelon prior to turning the plate in and that was still on the plate). The manager simply made a comment about how it was organic - no apology or compensation was offered. We weren't given silverware promptly with our food either. The overall experience won't have me returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Service was great! Cami was fantastic and will come back for sure! Food was great! Bacon bacon bacon!"}
{"text":"Went today for the first time & so excited to have a new spot, everything was perfect from service, food, and ambience, some of the other popular breakfast places are starting to feel like college cafeterias....Loud, crowded & get you in get you out. Morning squeeze is my new main squeeze! Best hash browns ever!"}
{"text":"I second John E. This place is a joke. I waited 45min for cold food. The only saving grace is that this place has hot waitresses. Otherwise this place sucks."}
{"text":"Had a very nice lunch at the Morning Squeeze. Sat outside and enjoyed the rising temps. My wife had a salad and I had the patty melt on rye... Both were great! Service was prompt and reliable and prices decent. The only negative was they didn't take Discover... But not a big deal."}
{"text":"For the over abundance of servers standing around, you would think the service would have been exceptional...we were one of two other tables.  Our server completely disappeared for a good 15 minutes while we waited to order. Food was subpar.  We won't be back again."}
{"text":"The veggie omelette was very watery and service was not superb. Had to ask and wait for everything including jelly for toast. With tip bill was $35 for two breakfasts and a glass of orange juice. Menu has a lot of variety and location was great but the portion of breakfast potatoes was small and swimming in all the water from the veggies in the omelette. This was our second and last time dining here. First time food was overlooked and dry. Not recommended for the price conscious customer compared to the quality of food."}
{"text":"Love coming here on the weekend. Outside patio is very comfortable. Best waffles and mimosas. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"We came on memorial day late moring. The place was packed but didn't have to wait long for patio seating. The food was good and reasonably priced. The drinks alcoholic and non alcoholic are pricey. The have the morning shade on the sidewalk seating. Servers were very responsive. Seemed to be the place to be for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever.  Sat opposite the kitchen and got extra orders.  We're here two days in a row on vacation.  Staff was great waitress \"fanny?\" Was great.  If we lived here I'd be 200 pounds.  Excellent selection with crossfit menu."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't write a review but after today's experience at Morning Squeeze I felt I needed to. We had eaten here the week before and everything was amazing so we decided to go again. The service was great but the Benedict was barely warm, the toast was stale, hash browns undercooked, and I found a piece of metal in the omelet!!!!!!! We told our server, gave her the the piece of metal, and she immediately went to speak with a manager... but came back only to say \"you're good to go, we took care of the bill.\" This is definitely not what we were looking for... we weren't looking for anything for free rather than just tell somebody about our experience so they could improve and not have this happen again. If it would have been handled properly, I would probably give it another try but we won't be back."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, and I'm hooked.  Everybody was super friendly and I have no idea how you couldn't feel happy in here ??? Just look at the decor.  They have a good selection of food and drinks ( adult and non ) My fav was the mango smoothie.   We were there with a big group and it was pretty crowded, but everybody kept their cool we all got our orders.  The regular menu look fab and I cant wait to come back here to try the rest of what  they have to offer"}
{"text":"This is a tremendous find for breakfast or lunch. Quantity choices, quality food, terrific service. Thank you Libby for taking care of our requests."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast ever!  Usually I have breakfast at the daily dose but this time we decided to choose a new place and the morning sqeeze review's are not too bad. My friend tried the omlett and I the lox bagel.  Both meals were tasteless and poor. The salmon looked disgusting,  was brown and the bagel was just a gummy dog toy. Even the coffee and the ''fresh squeezed' juice was not good. I can not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I go to Morning Squeeze periodically and thought I should write a review. I have been there perhaps 5 times in total. Ideally located on a visible corner off Scottsdale Rd in Old Town, the Morning Squeeze is fairly popular. It seems to appeal to a hip good looking crowd that was probably out the night before in Old Town. Not sure where I fit in that description! Nice interior design and vibe. Feels like a breakfast place. The servers here like those at local competitor the Breakfast Club hires exclusively young attractive women (girls) in short shorts or skirts. The men are mostly relegated to the kitchen and bus boy services. I like the food. The dishes are not IHOP. They are creative and tasty. Equal to but different than the Breakfast Club. One of my favorites is the Protein Pancakes. Not too sweet and very fulfilling. Fruit is fresh. Not all of the juices are fresh squeezed. If I would leave it at that I would give them a 4 star rating. My criticism of the Morning Squeeze is the service. While the girls are beautiful and some very nice, they are not on top of customer service. This is I believe the responsibility of the management to better train them. Many of the girls/women come off too snobby. While that is par for the course with pretty young women in social contexts, it is misplaced in a service context. This was the case 5 separate visits something not amiss by other guests. I hope they  sort this out. Overall I give the Morning Squeeze solid grades but due to the modest service quality not outstanding. I will re-review in the future and see if this has changed. I am rooting for the Morning Squeeze!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, but the service was horrible. Our waitress never refilled our waters and only came to the table to bring us the check after we flagged her down (and it was a Wednesday)."}
{"text":"Went here this morning for the first time. I had a horrible experience and am not sure I will go back. We sat at the bar and the servers took 10 minutes to even ask us if we wanted something to drink. Finally when we ordered food and got it, the order was wrong and the servers didn't care and didn't even offer to get me a new order. The service was horrible and the food was cold!"}
{"text":"Very lively, comfortable spot. The food is great and well worth a visit while you are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"There's something about this place. All gurls serving were fit and happy looking, we just couldn't stop admiring our waitress attitude! She did everything to make us feel welcomed and valued, definitely recommend for their amazing service. But food by itself was decent, frankly I can't rave a lot coz We ordered protein pack pancake which was a bit bitter no idea why it was! And other item was breakfast omelette which seemed nice.  Overall! Great ambiance + energetic waitresses & customer service oriented which i totally Loved!   Yay! But one small request- pls pls add more veg or Vegan option for breakfast, can't eat pancakes at 2p"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, and have experienced sub-par service, and an overcooked omelet.  The first time I went to the restaurant, the place was no more than a couple weeks old. We had to wait for a few minutes to be seated, but that is to be expected, as it is a new establishment.  After being seated and waiting for about 10 minutes, we finally had a server come and introduce herself.  Since we had already sat there for 10 minutes, we were both ready to order, but right after we had placed our drink orders, the waitress just sped off, so we had to wait another 5 minutes. When the server came back, I had ordered an omelet with potatoes.  The food came out about 15 minutes later, and my omelet was burnt, while the potatoes were cold.  I waited for a few minutes, but our server was nowhere in site.  At this point, I had become impatient and just ate the food and chalked it up to it being a new place, and would come back a 2nd time to try it again.  About 2 weeks ago, we finally decided to go back, thinking all the hype should have died down, and we should be able to get some decent service and food.  I was wrong.  We got seated and waited about 10 minutes for a server... again.  This time, we made sure to order the food, and then the drinks.  I ordered the same thing as i did the last time- an omelet.  The food came out while I was in the restroom, so I didn't have a chance to see it while the server was there, but the omelet was burnt... again.  Omelets are supposed to have some yellow to it, but this thing was BROWN.  Anyways, I came back, waited for about 5 minutes, only to see our server playing with a dog on the patio.  This went on for another 3 or 4 minutes, and again, I became a little upset at the fact that we had sat there for so long with minimal service, so I started eating the omelet.  It was a good thing, because she didn't come back until our plates were cleared.  Horrible service, and sub-par food... again.  The atmosphere is really cool, and the location is great.  I love to sit outside and people watch, but I do like to eat a decent breakfast with some service more.  I understand this is the new trendy restaurant in Scottsdale, but its going to lose fast, if it doesn't start taking care of its customers.  There are plenty of other breakfast places in the area that have outstanding service, with better food.  I suggest you look for those places."}
{"text":"So I thought I would add that a couple weeks after I posted this the manager messaged me asking for my email so he could send us a gift card to try it again and he never did:( I didn't leave the review because I wanted something for free I just didn't want people to expect to much. Guess some of the other reviews on the management are true."}
{"text":"Good service, solid menu, and descent prices. Been here several times and I have always had a good experience."}
{"text":"The Mexican Breakfast Burrito with green sauce was delicious!! It was very filling and there was just the right amount of ingredients - not too much chorizo but enough to taste a little bit in every bite. I love the decor here too especially the colors and the wall with the chalk art and grass on both sides."}
{"text":"Food was good. Fun to to sit on patio n people watch over brunch. Staff was a little slow. And I like when brunch places have unlimited mimosa specials and this place didnt so that was a bummer. I would go back but it wouldn't be my first suggestion."}
{"text":"Biggest, best breakfast burrito I've had at a restaurant. Finally people realize that people like to eat a lot of food for breakfast. Menu was HUGE too, I'll be back to try more things for sure."}
{"text":"Breakfast Gone Wrong First,no problem with my food or my server.  About 3/4 of the way through my meal, the manager John \"Gino\" Giannini dropped 2 plates of food behind me splattering bits of food on my arm, clothes,etc. Cut to the GONE WRONG....Gino comes up and hands me his business card and tells me how hi is fanatical about his clothes and if any of my clothes need dry cleaning to contact him.  Great EXCEPT they then hand me the ENTIRE BILL.  In no way did I expect they would pick up the bill $26, but I did think they would take my breakfast off the bill.  Super angry that he can tell me about how fanatical about he is about his clothes while allowing me to walk out with water spots (where I tried to get the food off) all over my shirt and shorts.  The people watching were amazed that it was the manager who did it and then did nothing but hand me his card.  I won't be back as long as John Gino  Giannini is the manager."}
{"text":"so its been a few months since my last review and true to my word I did not go back to Morning Squeeze for a while! this last weekend I descided I would try and take a couple orders from there when they came through instead of declining the runs.   I was very pleased. the wait times were minimal. The staff friendly. I was in and out in a very reasonable time!  whatever you guys did to improve things has worked!!  Thank you I will be happy to take runs from your restaurant again in the future!!"}
{"text":"A favorite spot! Absolutely love Laura - we always head straight for the bar. She remembers our drink order and makes sure we are well taken care of. Always nice to be remembered and know our brunch bartender!"}
{"text":"Slow slow slow. We got seated quickly and then waited 35 min. for our food. And, they wanted $4 to add blueberries to my pancakes. Our server 2 was great....when we said we were leaving she wasn't surprised!   I'm going back to Butter ' s."}
{"text":"This place is the best breakfast place! Really cute atmosphere, great food and drinks, and the servers are very fast an efficient. Will be back again and again! :)"}
{"text":"For a place that specializes in breakfast, we would expect quite a bit more.  We've been here 6 times now, and there's some good, and a lot of mediocre.  We frequent a lot of the breakfast spots here in Scottsdale (Breakfast Club, Daily Dose, etc.), and this place doesn't stack up.  While the service (we had Sam recently, and she was awesome) and the ambience are very good, the food just lacks anything that wows you.  There are two things that we'd recommend.  First, the waffles with the seasonal berries and granola are good (the granola puts it over the top).  Second, the smoothies are pretty darn good.  This place is also great if you wanna bring your pooch(es), as they are very dog friendly, and everyone there seems to love dogs as much as we do. Beyond that, the omelets and other standard breakfast fare are okay at best.  We had a really bad experience with the Chorizo (steer clear!), which was gamey (my fiancée validated), and presented very lackluster on a side plate (I'll post the picture right after the review).  We've also tried the Huevos Rancheros, various omelets, and breakfast sandwiches, and they've all been sub par.  I hope that this kitchen gets it together, as this place shows a lot of promise, but this place unfortunately just doesn't stack up to the local competition."}
{"text":"So I want to love this place and I do for its location and environment but the food leaves something to be desired. The bar and outside seating is ideal for a lazy weekend breakfast, the servers are on point but the food comes to the table consistently cold.   I judge a place by the temperature of its toast and they can't get that right. We're here 2-3 times a month and not once has my toast been delivered hot or even warm. The foods great, but temperature is pretty spotty. We're constantly send food back to be warmed or asking for hot toast. Your a breakfast place, hot food should be in your DNA.   Here's some unsolicited advice. Instead of having 3-4 hostess just standing inside the door, have them running food out to tables. Hot food for everyone and I bet you can turn your tables quicker on a busy morning."}
{"text":"Squeeze has a great atmosphere, fun to sit up at the bar and watching the specialty coffee and bar drinks being made. Lots of people watching on sidewalk and activity at bars across the street. Only negative is the volume. Acoustics in here make the place very loud when sitting inside, try and get an outdoor patio seat if possible. Considering how packed this place is in the mornings, the service is fast and the servers all friendly.  The food is consistently good. Great breakfast tacos, awesome homemade muffins (snickerdoodle blueberry a favorite!). Their Lox and bagels is served open faced and always fresh and a generous proportion. Their lunch garlic fries, black bean veggie burger and Reuben are some of our favorites. If you love bloody Mary's and bacon, get their Pigs Eye which has bacon vodka and is huge and dressed very cool.   What keeps me from the five star rating is considering this is a breakfast spot, their bread quality is very average and almost always is served cold (by the time it reaches the table) and under-toasted. This after probably 30 plus visits (we live a few blocks away).   Overall, we love Squeeze and love taking all our guests there. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I think this place will be around a long time because of the location, hip/cutesy decor, and full bar featuring 92,347 variations on a Bloody Mary. I think you end up paying for style with little substance.  The menu is pretty big. My group had a salad with chicken and a fancy sandwich. The \"local greens\" in the salad turned out to be iceberg lettuce, which was disappointing. The sandwich was okay, but the \"side of fries\" consisted of 14 fries. The coffee, on the other hand, was quite good. We didn't have anything from the bar.  Service was okay overall.  Perhaps the bar drinks are great or the huge menu is has some great options, but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I would say 4.5 stars. After working in the F&B industry for almost half my life, I understand a bit slower service for a place that gets so busy. I normally sit at the bar here and the bartenders/servers are attentive to their guests, while making drinks for the restaurant. They always make sure we have what we need, and are almost always friendly. This is a hard task to accomplish especially when I'm sure they are busy from open to close during spring training.  I took off half a star because I think they could have either a couple more staff on in certain places, and offer pagers for the longer wait days so we can walk around the area while waiting."}
{"text":"I use to really like this place, and most of my previous visits the food was delicious and fresh but not this time. It took almost 15 minutes just to get are lattes which in my opinion is a little long for a coffee. I ordered the squeeze with a side of country potatoes like I usually do unfortunately was not as tasty like my previous visits, the potatoes tasted like they had been sitting in a food warmer for a while so I did not really enjoy them. Service was okay just wish my server would have seemed a little happier to be there. I'm hoping my next visit will be a lot better next time."}
{"text":"Inept, rude staff who don't seem to care about anything. It took at least five to seven minuets for someone behind the bar to even acknowledge me or offer me a menu. Another Five minuets later it gets worse. Save yourself the trouble and do not go! The restroomes where filthy as well. This list could go on.For all Spring Training Visitors... Morning Squeeze just plain sucks."}
{"text":"It took the kitchen 35 minutes from when I ordered to send out eggs benedict with over cooked hashbrowns and undercooked poached eggs. Our server was very apologetic and said the kitchen had to keep remaking it, but still took 35 minutes to send out a terrible dish. I can't say it was because they were too busy, we were one of three tables for lunch."}
{"text":"Eh. Unimpressed. Poor waitresses look overworked- we had to ask the manager for refills, got my order wrong twice.  Breakfast was a little bland (we got the healthy options & apparently that means no flavor)  You have many other better and more delicious options nearby. Sorry morning squeeze, work more on your food and service instead of putting all your effort in a trendy vibe."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time and Im already in love with the retro vibe and delicious food! The other day, my boyfriend and I were searching online for a dog-friendly brunch spot in Scottsdale, end Morning Squeeze caught our attention with their puppy food menu! We arrived at the restaurant before noon and were seated immediately on the patio with our dog, who loved all the attention and pets from the waitresses. The weather was perfect outside, so it was a little bothersome to have multiple blazing heaters above us. But our young and polite waitress came over with waters for us and the pup. Service was very fast and friendly, which is why Im giving them five stars!! We ordered ourselves orange juice cocktails and food (the VW Squeeze was an  on point egg sandwich!) and decided to treat our doggo to the \"pup-cakes and gravy\" and she devoured it! It was all a tad overpriced, but I dont mind treating myself to a quality brunch once in a while, and I'll definitely go back to the Squeeze with my family soon!"}
{"text":"The breakfast tacos are pretty good and they have fresh orange juice. The service was good and our waitress was attentive and nice. The noise level was fairly high, so it's not a quiet or relaxing breakfast spot by any means. The one thing that was awful always the first stall in the women's bathroom- if your over 5\"2'- you aren't going to fit!! LOL!! Just warning you..."}
{"text":"I didn't even eat here. I couldn't get past the hostess with short brown hair. We came for Mother's Day and asked how long the wait was for 2 people and we got \"30 minutes\". We said thank you but we were going to check somewhere else and may be back because we were hungry. We came back about 5 minutes later and I asked her to put my name in and she literally gave me the rudest laugh and didn't make any eye contact and said \"yeah sure I guess\" and then I said \"thank you\" and she RUDELY said \"yep\". What ... Was... Her problem? Won't be back. Don't want to go back. I can only imagine what the rest of the staff was like. I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worst service I have seen by far. After calling in two orders I was told that it would be a 15-20 minute wait. One order was ready after 30 minutes, even though the restaurant was nearly empty. After another 10 minutes I asked a server where the second order was a she just stood there and said that it looked like they were getting a to-go order ready so she didn't need to go check on it. Upon asking a second time where my order was I was informed that the kitchen thought it was a duplicate order so they cancelled it. No attempts to resolve the situation were made by the server or the manager who rudely handed me the food and walked away. Never coming back to this restaurant again. The mediocre food isn't worth enduring the horrible service."}
{"text":"I went here with friends for lunch since we work nearby. It wasn't awesome. It's trendy inside, and the waitresses all wear athletic attire, and everything is neon colored, blah blah. Typical Scottsdale trendy stuff. I got the turkey club, which was disgusting. There was ham on it, which it didn't state on the menu, and the ham eventually had to be taken off because it tasted like either over salted balogna, or Spam. The fries were cold, stuff and flavorless. I got a side of ranch to dip my bland cold fries in, and it was so salty I asked the waitress what was wrong with it. She brought me a new side, but it was the same. Salty as all get out. My friend had a breakfast plate she appeared to enjoy, with a side of biscuits and gravy. We tried a bite of the biscuits and gravy, but they were awful. The gravy also tasted like it had Spam or bologna or something in it, and was otherwise without flavor. It has the weirdest aftertaste. There were three of us at the table who love biscuits and gravy, but nobody wanted them. Maybe this place is better at doing breakfast, I don't know, but for the expensive lunch I had, I was very disappointed with the taste and quality of the food, and also the typical Scottsdale attitude of the waitress. Save your nearly twenty bucks and go to Rehab Burger Therapy - or anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"GENO is the light of this restaurant. I work right down the street, and when  Myself and Co-worker walk he, he not only remembers our name, but what we order. He is extremely attentive, and polite!   Thank you for your hospitality!"}
{"text":"I love the location and atmosphere of this place. Although for a place called morning squeeze they don't have fresh juices squeezed in house. They are just \"locally squeezed\" and not even all of their juices are.  We got there at 11:30 on a Friday and for 2 ppl the wait was 20 min so we sat at the bar. Our food took about 40 min to come out. By then we were kinda over it. Food is mediocre nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"First visit today for brunch with girlfriends. Service, especially management was very disappointing.  Drink orders are extremely slow.  Ordered two of same drink but received two that were very different, one breakfast order was incorrect, and iced coffee order to go was incorrect.  Two of us were over charged and the manager came over to tell us how WE must have misunderstood...no apology.  Felt like an attempt at telling us we should pay the higher amount. Also, tried to tell my friend that her iced coffee she sent back was made properly.  It was not.   After 20 minutes, we finally received corrected tabs.  There was never an apology for confused orders, miscommunications or delays.  Just bad attitude by the manager. It's too bad since it is a cute place and food (that was ordered correctly) was good."}
{"text":"Failed on every level. 40 MINUTES for food to arrive, place less than 1/3 full. Server nice, but only apologized for the wait after I mentioned it was 30 minutes and no food in sight. No adjustment for bad service. One entree came with wrong eggs, which she did catch and bring out new eggs. Other entree, Hillbilly Highrise didn't match the description, no layers of hash browns, a very few laying on the bottom? Chickend Fried Steak was horribly overcooked.  Also was $14.00 with no toast or biscuit or bread of any kind. Large OJ 5.75, think it was out of a gallon jug.  Best new restaurants, thinking NOT. Was excited to go and bummed it is not good. You can tell no manager visible on the floor and server even told us \"the kitchen is messing up everything\". Decor is cool.  Worst $42 I've spent in a very long time!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, the food was amazing (we got the famous French toast and Pulled Pork Benedict) and it's the cutest place! ..I also love that they offer outdoor seating and allow pets on the patio. Will be back soon! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I mean I know it's 11am on a Saturday but would it kill anyone behind the bar to have a smile on their face?"}
{"text":"Great food and the best service I've had in years! Robyn took great care of us! I'll be back"}
{"text":"Yeah... I was not pleased at all with the food. I couldn't eat half of what I got (odelay scramble with hash browns).  The hash browns were very buttery and the scramble was a mess.  No real flavor other than butter and the coffee came with coffee grounds and was very bitter."}
{"text":"It's colorful, it's filled with HOT Scottsdale Athletic Eye Candy just off their morning Saturday hangover run cure, and the menu is creative.  There's a wait for Sunday Brunch of course, but that's part of the scene.  The food tastes great, although they serve everything at room temperature, so you have to not be put off by that.  Best to go with friends who stayed over from the night before, cuz that's what everybody around you will be shouting about, lol.  It IS noisy, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're in the mood for it.  Fairly inexpensive as well.  It is NOT a good place if you want a calm Sunday breakfast however, so that's what prevents me from giving it five stars.  Nevertheless it's fun and unusual and pretty good."}
{"text":"Extensive menu - great outdoor atmosphere. Given their name, was surprised to find out they don't actually offer any fresh squeezed juices...which was sort of the purpose of going. :0("}
{"text":"Longest wait for food I've ever experienced. So many good restaurants in Scottsdale.. Don't waste your time..   Watched many people send their food back. Horrible service as well."}
{"text":"This place exceeded all expectations. Oh man, every bite was on point. The staff are all friendly and the environment is awesome. I came in to find a quick breakfast and now I'm going to become a regular. I got he breakfast burrito and left extra full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place so took my friends there before going tubing down the river... server at first told me the restaurant didnt carry bottled water I had to show her on the menu that they did .. then she bought out the water and told me it was the last 5 bottles they had.....and that the didnt plan on carrying bottled water because tap water sells more..... i didn't know you could sell tap water? Need less to say I ordered a berry smoothie as well which was delicious! When our server aisha came back she was rude (i think she overheard us making fun of the fact she didnt know that a restaurant would have bottle water )and when one of my guests ordered a drink she told her know because she reaked of alcohol.... funny thing is non of us had drank yet and had all showered so she said I cant serve you its my judgement call... we asked to speak to the manager who everyone knows is going to back up the server .... after I informed the manager that none of us had drank and she was mistaken she had the nerve to tell me I reaked of alcohol as well.... best part is I dont drink and was the designated driver.... this place got a 2 for the smoothie being great it also gets me informing the world that their uneducated staff and mcdonalds bound management should be replaced and maybe they would be as busy as surounding establishments ... now at the breakfest club and so far its a five star time here"}
{"text":"Despite the fun decor and good service, I would not go back here to eat. My husband's omelette was a half inch thick overcooked egg pancake folded in half and stuffed, my hash and eggs were greasy and the toast was burnt. Maybe this place would be better at the bar."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Service was subpar. The bartender seems to ignored us and was very curt and distracted."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in Old Town. Always great service, tasty food. Get there early if you don't want to wait for a table, they get busy!!"}
{"text":"New in town (April 2014) from Seattle.  Only other breakfast spot was Breakfast Club, which I really liked ie great location, atmosphere, fast friendly service and great food at fair prices! Morning squeeze was a cool spot with ok food and friendly staff, but over-priced for the quality and portion sizes. I will not go back to Morning Squeeze again. Breakfast Club is my spot from now on."}
{"text":"I got take out this morning which was called in. The food was ready when we arrived but on the call in I had ordered the breakfast tacos,asking if they had any veggies they could add, she said no and then they even forgot the salsa- so basically this was eggs, cheese and bacon in a tortilla- not very tacoy.   My coworkers also ordered food and it took about 30 minutes to get take out."}
{"text":"Breakfast: eggs, potatoes, bacon, coffee and juice...you know, breakfast. $22.00. $10 entree, $3 coffee, $6, 10 oz OJ, (say what?) $3 tip plate-sized side of hash browns. It was good, but not that good. I'll stick with Waffle House: twice the food for half as much, and just as good. Better coffee in fact.  Final judgment, good but not great, 25% overpriced."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"Grilled BLT\". It wasn't grilled, but toasted. Then bacon was cold, French fries were soggy, and old.  Waitress asked how everything was only after we were almost finished eating. Never offered a refill of our drinks, or anything. Not worth it, and wont go back."}
{"text":"We liked it. Yes, food took a while and some things came out wrong, but they opened 8 days ago. Once they work out the kinks this place will be great. Server/bartenders were SO nice, food was good, atmosphere is fantastic. French press coffee? Yes please. Really creative breakfast menu and breakfast cocktail selection."}
{"text":"We normally find a couple of seats by the bar area so the service is quick and friendly. The omelettes are my favorite.  Good brunch place overall but I avoid seating inside of the restaurant if I can avoid it.  Almost every time we have been the kitchen manages to burn a toast or something so the interior of the restaurant smells like burnt toast. You would thing they will figure it out one of these days. Either better toaster or a better venting."}
{"text":"Great new place to have breakfast or brunch on the weekends. Couple of friends and I went in for a late breakfast on Sunday, there was a little bit of the wait, but to be expected from anyplace nearby that time of day (even Denny's). We all got a variety of items of the menu, from French Toast to Breakfast tacos and everyone loved their food. Couple mimosas for one member of the party as well...  Pros- -Good, diverse menu with plenty to choose from -Pricing was very reasonable, especially for quality of the food -Atmosphere was lively and definitely a laid back feel  Cons- -Can be a wait at popular times (but so is every place) -Kitchen seemed to be overwhelmed at times (one friend who ate here before was served undercooked hash browns, probably from a rush to get food out)  Overall as great of a breakfast place as you'll find around Old Town, especially for the price. Worth a shot to try out if you haven't."}
{"text":"Love sitting outside on the patio people watching. Probably one of my favorite breakfasts in Scottsdale! The Chowhound Scramble is my jam. I get it without cheese though so my parents aren't punished with the smell later."}
{"text":"Love this place for Mimosas and an excellent breakfast.  For lunch I recommend The Monte Christo sandwich or the Cesar chicken wrap.  Great wait staff and food is always delicious.  They get busy on the weekends but generally you won't wait very long for a table."}
{"text":"Service painfully slow!!!   Busy........but 30 minutes for 2 fried eggs??   Food not bad"}
{"text":"Unfriendly hostesses wouldn't seat us at any of the 10 open tables or the bar, saying all those sections were closed at 10:00 am and that it was a  25 min wait. We waited only because the other person i was dining with was adamant we eat here to try something new. It was not worth the 25 min wait, and we were rewarded with poor service and bad food. Try the breakfast club instead for better food and a place that will let you sit at open tables."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and location. Can get pretty busy and noisy at times but I like the environment. They have a huge menu with tons of options. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go to this place. But the wait was an hour, hostesses were rude and the food was not very impressive after the hibiscus orange juice. My monte cristo was cold by the time we got everyone else's food because they brought our plates out in waves. In our party of 7 no one really raved about any of their dishes. Wish we had eaten somewhere that sat you closer to your reservation time. What's the point of reserving if they can't?"}
{"text":"This 5 star review is a little bit different than the rest. My grandma was recently diagnosed with cancer and is 84 years old. I called on the way in to check and see if there was a wait in which I was told that we should be able to get right in. By the time we arrived, the wait had changed to 30 min. After explaining our situation the owner/manager was extremely helpful and put us in a booth right away. It made for a wonderful brunch and meant a lot to my family. It was a true showing of high class and on top of that the food was excellent. The only knock against the place would have to be the amount of time it took to get our food. However, our waitress was great and everyone was accommodating. I love the portion sizes (had some to take home) and was thrilled to eat a healthy egg white veggie omelet that completely satisfied me in the hunger and taste department. 2 thumbs up for morning squeeze."}
{"text":"Great Service, good food, reasonable prices, cute atmosphere.  We were visiting Old Town Scottsdale and were looking for a place that 3 very different people could eat and be happy.  This fit the bill perfect, Nice salad for one, Reuben Sandwich for another and Bagel and Lox for the 3rd.  All happy and satisfied. Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The place looks great, lot of young woman there. Food is ok but nothing special.  Coffee is horrible, and not sure why the manager or owner was chewing his gum looking like a goat.  I try a different place next time."}
{"text":"Food was good but took 30-40 minutes to get our food. We went with our three kids and they were starving!  Way too long to wait for your food order!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. Waited for about 15 minutes, hostess was very friendly. Service in general was not that great.   I asked for eggs my way, with cheddar cheese and mushrooms and onions in my eggs. Husband had the fit bowl and we shared the oats and nuts waffle. I asked a few questions as we hadn't ate here, however the server did not know the answer, like what kind of nuts were in the waffle. Not a huge deal but the server did not offer to find out, which is not good service in my opinion.  Waited for about 30 minutes for our food. My dish came out without cheese and onions, missing butter and jam for the toast and no butter for the waffle. Waitress came to check on the food and I let her know I was missing the cheese and onions and butter and jam. She responded that it should be there, although it obviously wasnt. She came back with shredded cheese on top of my eggs, cold. I asked if it can be melted.  She came back again but they then added green peppers to my egg.   My husband asked for ketchup for the hasbrowns. Waited several minutes, no ketchup. I went to the host stand and asked for ketchup, another employee said sure, and then said she'll be right there. I go back to our table, wait a couple more minutes. Our waitress comes by, but just to clean the next table. Still no ketchup. Finally someone else brings it out.  I ask the waitress for our check and she picks up my silverware from my plate, of my uneaten waffle, and grips it by bottom end of the fork prongs. I explained that I hadn't ate the waffle yet, and could I have new silverware. She found this to be a weird request, but why would I eat with utensils picked up in her hand (the part that goes in my mouth) not the handle.   Overall the food was average. I did like the waffle, although it had cooled off significantly by the time I got to try it."}
{"text":"We called ahead for a party of 5 and we're put on the list (25 minutes) for a table on a Saturday morning. After 50 minutes of waiting we were sat. Honestly, not that bad in Scottsdale, it just sucked we were told 25.  The inside tables were riddled with flies and the temp was about 80.  Our server was nice and friendly, but we had to repeatedly ask where our food was. We waited 70 minutes for the food to be delivered. She made excuses about the kitchen being slammed but didn't apologize.  The food was good, but we won't be back. Not worth it!"}
{"text":"A favorite Old Town breakfast joint. Weekend brunch might be a long wait, but it's Old Town on the weekend...expect it and plan ahead! Service is usually great, and they have an allergen friendly menu (gluten free)."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast experience I've ever had. The staff was terrible. We were one of the first people there and the wait time was 45 minutes. Never stopped to refill coffee or water. The food was awful. The Tuscan toast tasted rancid. The eggs Benedict were hard boiled at best. The potatoes cold and lack luster. The whole meal should have been comped due to the horrible experience."}
{"text":"Stopped with friends to cure a hangover. Really good menu,  good coffee. I had veggie omlette, no egg whites. I prefer the whole egg. It was good, huge portions. Good potatoes and fruit. Only comment was that my friends pancakes weren't cooked all the way through. The waitress did take it off the bill, which was gracious. With all the food we had, no one went hungry.  Open up one in the south east valley- Chandler. We need more breakfast places."}
{"text":"Food was not cooked properly at first go around. Pancakes were batter in The middle. Country-fried steak was soggy and had a bad flavor to it(tasted like bad/old oil). When we brought up our concerns to the manager, after only a few bites, he made excuses instead of simply apologizing and replacing. Eventually, he said he would take care of it. Then the server dropped the check off with the steak still included. When I questioned that fact, her response was \"yeah, I need to have my manager take care of that.\"  Girl, don't give me a check you know is wrong and hope I just pay it.   Overall, bad experience. Won't be going back to this place as there are many other great breakfast options in old town."}
{"text":"Good, definitely not great, definitely not work the price tag. Spent $70 for three people to eat a moderate amount of food and two mimosas. Hostess was less than impressive with service, our server was very nice. We waited a long time for food once our order had been placed, and it was a Friday afternoon, not prime time breakfast time. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I will never be back. We sat down and didn't get service for over 10 minutes. We complained over many issues and all they did was take the side of hash browns off our bill to compensate. The manager never stopped by to apologize. The busser yelled at us. It was horrible service and food. DO NOT COME HERE."}
{"text":"My wife and I moved to the Phoenix area several years ago and always avoided this place based on recommendations from friends and coworkers. Despite that, we decided to give it a try last Sunday.  Big mistake. Mediocre service and it took over 45 minutes to get two simple meals.  The place was busy, but not so much that any competent kitchen couldn't have handled the work. Aside from being located in the tourist trap area of Old Town and catering to spoiled kids spending daddy's money, this place just isn't very good."}
{"text":"What a great morning / afternoon. Great food, service and mimosa's. The breakfast appetizers were lovely.  Michele was amazing.  Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out in exchange for my normal Old Town breakfast haunt, Daily Dose. Food was good, service was good, but man was the manager on duty (I'm assuming he was, who else would wear a cardigan) was an absolute prick! All he did was run around yelling and swearing at the wait staff. At one point he walked over to a group of servers and shouted, \"Why are you all standing around!\" (here's a hint, NOBODY was in the place) and then as he was walking away he made sure to shout \"F&*K!\" for the entire place to hear. This continued the entire time we were in for breakfast. Seriously, if you treat your staff like an asshole they'll probably be less inclined to help you out. Or at least I'd suspect that might be the case.   Food is 3 stars Service is 4 stars Over tanned Scottsdale D-bag Manager in cardigan is 0 stars"}
{"text":"About us:  My husband (hubster) and I live in Scottsdale and go out to breakfast once every weekend.  I try to pick a different place each time because I'm adventurous and we haven't yet found a place to become a regular favorite.    This review is for the:  Morning Squeeze, Scottsdale Road location   Summary:  Atmosphere lacking for me, but food good.  A little spendy for what it is, but comparable prices for Old Town, so that's perfectly okay (total bill for 2 was $30and change, +tip = $37; a little much for standard  breakfast fare for 2, but not bad for Old Scottsdale). Service was decent, too.  Love the dog friendly patios.  Cute to see a waitress carrying a tray with water glasses on one hand, and a dog-bowl with water in it in the other hand. :-)  The atmosphere:  This is a little place on a corner on the North edge of Old Scottsdale.  It's a sit-down breakfast/lunch restaurant.  It is VERY noisy, with the exception of the North patio, which has doors to mitigate the sound of the restaurant but only has about 5 or 6 small (2 person) tables in it.  It was full, so we couldn't sit there, but we were able to get a table outside on the West side, right along Scottsdale Road; better, but not ideal because the West side of the restaurant is open-air with a bar and seating flowing onto the patio - no walls to shut out the noise of the inside (and music a bit much, too).  On seating outside:  While it's a cute, upbeat, trendy environment with nice looking booths inside, it was also way too NOISY.  Seriously - like a night club -  not how I like to start off my Sunday morning.  I want to relax and enjoy my breakfast and Sunday morning, not jump into it screaming like a cold shower.  Even outside, hubster and I had to shout across our little bar topper table to talk with one another.  There's no way I would have made it through the meal indoors.  Fortunately, it's now the end of October, so the weather is finally allowing outdoor seating to be possible.  Service:  They have lots of nice, pretty, young waitresses whose service is just fine.  Ours checked in with us two or three times during the meal and came to the table promptly to get us started with drinks (which was quick) and then take our order.  The only wait was maybe 5ish minutes to get the bill when we were done.  No problem.  That's 4-5 touches on our table, which is perfectly fine for breakfast considering we never even finished our coffees.  Speaking of which...  Food:  Oy, terrible coffee.  Bitter, super hot, and way, way too strong.  So much that, for me, three sugars and the whole little cup of creamer and some ice cubes barely made a dent in taming it.  But, if you like super strong, hot, bitter coffee, you're going to love it!  Hubster and I never even drank enough of it to get refills, though.  I had an orange ricotta pancake (delish - although there's no ricotta on it so it must be in it) and biscuits and gravy. The gravy tastes like the canned variety, but I happen to like that flavor and thought it was good; husband was more \"meh\" on it.  Hubster had bacon, eggs, gravy, chick fried steak; standard breakfast things.  He said it was fine - pretty neutral on it.  I loved that they garnished his plate with fresh fruit, which he doesn't like, but I do - works for me 'cuz I ate it!  Overall, I'd say the food was okay.  Also, the morning alcoholic beverage menu looked really good.  If I had any inclination to drink booze in the morning, this would be an excellent choice.  End result:  We probably won't go back unless we're in the area and see that there's seating open on the North side."}
{"text":"I was there everyday for the month of March for Spring training. The place is friendly and the prices can not be bet. I had one bad server, but management responded A.S.A.P. I was impressed. This is a plus for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Super great breakfast spot!  Wonderful service, great menu, cool retro environment."}
{"text":"Awesome venue in downtown Scottsdale! Love everything about this place. Hubby & I had omlets. Yummy!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice. First our order was messed up, but server went above and beyond to make it right and food was good. This time on 4/9 our server was inattentive - had to get up and ask for water at the bar as server ignored us for 15 minutes and we had just finished hiking. She would not have refilled coffee if we hadn't asked. The food was outright bad - burnt creme brulee pancakes, tasteless breakfast burrito, and bland potatoes and hash browns. I only give the place any stars because the red-haired hostess was really nice, the other not so much."}
{"text":"Best place in downtown Scottadale! Love sitting at the bar. Great service, great coffee and delicious food. Definitely order the pigs eye Bloody Mary if you love bloody Mary's. Comes with a side of bacon."}
{"text":"Friday lunch here was very good, especially the biscuits and gravy. I try them every time I am at a new breakfast place as a gauge of what the rest of the menu might be like and theirs were terrific. I know it can be insanely busy there in the weekends so I will keep this as a weekday spot, but I'm definitely craving those biscuits and gravy! Healthy scramble was good too."}
{"text":"Not good and glacially slow food service. Very pleasant waitresses. Avoid the frozen mochas and the French toast."}
{"text":"I was taken here by a friend who lives in Scottsdale. He said it was one of the best breakfast places in town. His claim for Morning Squeeze's greatness was supported by how busy the place was and the amount of people waiting for a table. Unfortunately, Morning Squeeze did not come close to what I expected.  Our group of four was put on the waiting list with a estimated wait time of 20 min. After close to the 30 min mark I asked the hostess what the status was on our wait and she said we STILL had two groups on front of us. What we didn't realize is we would of waltzed right in and sat at the bar to order. The hostess could of done a better job by either giving us a more realistic time table, giving us a heads up on how many groups of equal size were in front of us, and/or recommending to us to sit at the bar (provided there was space for four people). Ultimately, we found space for three at the end of the bar. I chose to stand because we did not want to wait any longer and I still had hope the place would redeem themselves via the food.  The servers behind the bar were moderately attentive during our meal. We placed our order for food and drinks with no issue but the next problem was how long the food took to get to us, which was about 20-25 min. I'm a pretty patient person but the wait to sit combined with the wait for food was unacceptable. This is also considering the fact I saw people who came AFTER us get their food first (it looked like one of the workers who might of been the manager of the place knew these people personally). The lachs/lox (smoked salmon) omelette I ordered was good  and my friends seemed to think the food was average for the price ($7 yogurt and granola parfait? really??).  In the end, the ambiance of the restaurant is what I feel attracts people. It seems trendy. You can sit outside and also bring your dog. The female servers are dressed like they just got done with a Crossfit workout session (low-cut workout tank top, yoga pants, and running shoes)...but all of that doesn't cover-up the poor service or average food.  If you are passing through this area, I would recommend looking else where to eat breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm not one to write negative reviews but Morning Squeeze really was a let down this morning. I've been a few times before and never have received this inattentive of service. When we finally did put our order in it took forever to actually get our food. The server blamed the kitchen staff, but when the food was delivered it wasn't even hot. I would call that a server issue not kitchen. The people at the table next to us ordered after we did and received their food at least 10 min before us. When our food was finally delivered we didn't have silverware so the food sat on our table for about 5 mins before they came back with utensils. After waiting almost an hour for food, this was unacceptable. The food itself was ok. I think we ate it all because we were starving by the time it came. With all the other breakfast places to choose from in Old Town, it's doubtful we'll be back here."}
{"text":"Doing a great job to continue to become one of \"the\" breakfast places in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, my wife and I come here at least once a week. The breakfast rush is usually pretty crazy so we come after around 11am, we like to eat breakfast a lot later than others. The best seat in the house in my opinion is in the back booths where you get a lot of natural light and a great view of the street, plus the air conditioning is great, and much needed here in Old Town during the summer months.  The bartenders are also very nice and quick when making drinks, and are always up for conversation. Our favorite server is Chris, he served us today at 1230 and was very attentive! He took our order down and read it back to us so it was 100% accurate. He also checked in with us after the first bite to make sure everything was great. If you come here see if Chris is working, he'll take care of you and make sure you get an amazing dining experience.  Now let's talk food, I've had a lot of food on this menu and all of it is exceptional. The breakfast tacos are a must, and so are their protein pancakes with peanut butter on the side. My wife gets the \"Eggs My Way\" plate and it's got all the essentials for a hearty breakfast. If you're coming in for lunch grab the Caesar wrap and fries, delicious.  If you're visiting in the area and are craving breakfast or a great healthy lunch, this is the spot! Thanks again Chris and Morning Squeeze for a great experience every week, we'll be back soon!  Chad and Laci"}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch, split the Cali Benedict with a friend and it was sooo good, I regretted not being able to have the whole thing to myself! Fun people watching and excellent service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great location and the vibe is pretty cool. Prepare to wait a bit. The service was very good, the food well nothing to write hope about. Have a cup of coffee and people watch."}
{"text":"All of the reviews for this place are glowing, but it is really nothing special.  I had the eggs benedict florentine, which was cooked very well, but had very little taste (so weird!) My boyfriend had the Eggs My Way, which was, once again, nothing special.  I also had an iced vanilla latte-- it wasn't anything great and, unfortunately, Starbucks would have been better. The regular coffee was really good, not sure what they're brewing, but it was smooth and I wish I got that instead of the iced latte.  We didn't have to wait for a table, so that was nice, but after a while a line did start forming by the front door.  Dogs are allowed on the side patio where there is a separate entrance, so that is pretty neat.  It's not bad, but it is just not incredible or amazingly awesome-- you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awful service, dirty water glasses, messed up orders. Came back a second time hoping things would be better and they weren't. This place is a joke"}
{"text":"Food is great, service is literally a -10 every time we come. Only come for the food. Takes more then 10+ minutes to be greated, have to wave down waitress for a refill on drinks or our bill and not once are we ever asked if our food came out right.  Really disappointing"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. My brother and i went on Sunday and as always we had a great staff that got everything we needed. i drink a good amount of tea so they had to refill my glass over and over. even though this can be annoying they were always happy about it and not rude at all. Also love that they are dog friendly and look forward to bring my pups up. :)"}
{"text":"My favorite, go-to breakfast in Scottsdale. It has a reteo-modern vibe and every menu item is amazing. Their mimosa flights are heavenly and amazingly priced for the portion we received. Often a wait during busy times, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Holy... Best breakfast EVER! Do yourself a favor and try my crucial combo, the breakfast tacos (no meat for me! sub black beans instead) and the mocha fit frap.  The food tastes fresh, not greasy or heavy. The tacos are probably the lightest tacos I've ever had.  We went 3 weekends in a row it was so good. I could seriously eat this every morning for the rest of my life and be a happy happy girl.   The service is great. The servers and food runners are attentive and friendly.  The decor is bright and clean, inside is pretty noisy on a Sunday morning but you if can sit outside on a nice day you'll find it less \"happening\" and a little toned down.  You can also bring your dog on one side of the patio; always a plus in my book.   I honestly don't need to go anywhere else for a breakfast, this is my new spot."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE brunch spot! Everything here is so amazing. The breakfast tacos, eggs benedict, everything! The service is always great and they have a dog friendly patio. Yum"}
{"text":"I'm starting to believe I may be a service snob......but I just have to believe it is not THAT hard to give good service! I have been wanting to try this place- always trying to expand my brunch options! My sister and I put our name in and waited on the beach chairs out front (Love those!) and people watched. Our name was called and they put us at a booth inside. We noticed 2 high tops were available on the patio. I asked for one and she sat us out there. (Have no hostesses ever played \"Sally's Diner\"?! Gotta maximize and not use up all your 4 tops with just 2 people!)   Our server was nice....but not very experienced. My sister asked for a coffee recommendation and the caramel latte she got was almost minty. Not delish. I had just a coffee....which was rarely filled unless I asked. At one point I asked her to \"warm up\" my coffee a \"little bit.\" She poured a tiny amount in and asked if it was okay. Haha Gotta get up on your brunch lingo, girl! Plus, I feel like I should never have to ask for a refill. Maybe that makes me a diva. What ever. We waited quite a while for our food (okay it was a Saturday morning-I can understand that.) BUT! When our food came it was luke warm at best. She never asked how our food was and dropped off our check with a \"yep.\" No- we didn't want anything else, or a box, or anything..... Our plates were never cleared. We ended up walking the bill up to our server at the hostess stand....where she was standing and not refilling my coffee. ;-)  The food would have been good if it was hot but the service REALLY killed it for us. It was kind if painful being able to see The Breakfast Club from where I was sitting...next time I'll probably go there."}
{"text":"I was definitely disappointed by the morning squeeze. Service was great and I really loved the retro ish atmosphere. It's also a plus that dogs are allowed on the patio.  The downfall though, was the food. Everything was decent. Decent being the best way to put it. Things were just bland. The salsa and sauces all were bland. The eggs Benedict had holindase that was watery and tasted like nothing. Overall, i would scoot over to another option for breakfast over the morning squeeze."}
{"text":"Really fun place for everyone to have breakfast.  There are puce vinyl booths with tall sides on the interior, and a long bar with seats both inside and on the sidewalk.  Misters hover in the overhang for when misters are necessary to keep patrons chill.  Servers are in track shoes and pastel sports gear.  Orders do come out of the kitchen quickly, but come on - Do we really need that visual reminder of how that all happens?   I had a pulpy orange juice - delicious.  And a guilty short stack. Also delicicous.  But fair warning.  Food should be cooked, not ready to be spit out.  The sausage links were pink, warm, and as far as I could tell, closer to raw than cooked.  Without prompting, the server took them off the table as well as off the check.     Gotta run.  Hope to see you here again soon."}
{"text":"Avoid Libby at all cost. By far the worst experience I've ever had here. Everyone else was great, great atmosphere,  and great food. For now on, I will be asking for anyone but her."}
{"text":"First place we grabbed something to eat in Scottsdale after flying in on a work related trip. My wife got a turkey club sandwich and I opted for the standard house burger rather than the build my own option.My burger came as a dry meat patty sitting inside a bun and some onion,lettuce and a bit of tomato on the side.Some McDonalds style straw fries came with it.My whole meal tasted as bland as dead rats on toast.Thank God I had a Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA to go with it.I don't know what their mission is but the chef has gotta go."}
{"text":"Really like the vibe at morning squeeze! Love the bright, natural lighting from the windows as well as the brightly colored, but not obnoxious decor. I always get a cup of coffee and choose from one of their tasty egg breakfasts! And all the friends that I've brought here have fallen in love--they never want to eat anywhere else for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Love it!  Great atmoshpere and food.  Only complaint is that they close at 2:30 on the weekends.  WTF?!  It's Scottsdale.  When you still have a full house at 2:30 why close?!  Half of Scottsdale is just waking up and you could make so much money well past 2:30.  Otherwise, great staff and food."}
{"text":"Ooof. This was a bad experience. We waited more than 30 minutes for a table (not their fault) only to be told by our server that \"the kitchen is running really slow.\" So, we waited another 30 minutes for our food and, to put it mildly, it was horrible. The eggs Benedict were overcooked and came without hollandaise, like the chef forgot. The breakfast burrito was flavorless.   It is worth waiting for good food. I wish we had gone for cheap breakfast burritos instead and saved the time and money on this meal. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Sooooooo sloooooowwww. Breakfast Club is way better and worth the wait...waitress took 20 min to get me my champagne. Food was just average. Not worth $50 ..."}
{"text":"Monday morning....almost all of the servers looked like they were having a bad day, no one was smiling. Anyways, outdoor patio and booths, a plus but not enough of a plus for the greasy hash brown, crappy bagel breakfast sandwich, in which the only thing that was fresh was the avocado. The \"fruit\" that came with it was a sorry slice of orange. Nope, I don't recommend, unless you like a side of grease on your plate."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved this little spot. The lox bagel is my favorite along with their Bloody Mary selection. Skip the mimosas and get them at a cheaper location around old town."}
{"text":"Waited forever !!! We were so hungry for some great breakfast. We thought we would give this place a try. We walked in and asked for first available of course it was outside. It was fine , the weather was nice and we were hungry. Then we waited, waited, and waited. The next group of people came over and sat down. Not 5 mins later they got a service!!! Not to mention, the waitress was very friendly with them. Then the waitress finally came over to us. She was short and not friendly.  So we ordered our food. I ordered steak and eggs.  Medium rare for steak. After about, what seemed like, 30 mins the food came but instead of a medium rare,  my steak was well. She did offer to take it back but we didn't feel like waiting for , what seemed like, another half hour. We finished our food and left. Never going back again."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Great coffee. Awesome atmosphere so many great options. Definitely recommend! Also awesome location close to shops and mall."}
{"text":"Fun dog-friendly brunch spot with nice patio (they even have a dog menu)! Service was friendly! It was a little slow to get a table and get our food but we were a large group on a Saturday morning. Lots of healthy and not so healthy options. It's definitely the kind of place where everyone in your group can find something they like."}
{"text":"Went back again. Food quality was much better! Mocha shake was good and hash browns were delicious."}
{"text":"Love this breakfast spot!! The food is consistently good from my experience. I always bring my family here when they are in town. The owner is also very friendly and makes an effort to come by and chat with us even when it's busy."}
{"text":"Sorry guys. I know breakfast places are all the rage but this was not great. I live locally and needed pancakes so we made our way here at about 1pm.  Pros:  cute ambiance, cute outside area, decent coffee.  Cons:  food took just under an hour and all I ordered were pancakes and potatoes Pancakes had black burnt bits all over them which made them very unappetizing  Potatoes were cold and they gave me such a small portion for $3.50, really? They were supposed to have peppers and onions, I guess they did have 2 random pepper pieces......? Total $16 for 3 burnt bit pancakes and a few potatoes and coffee.   Save your money."}
{"text":"This place is just down right amazing.  The wait is worth it! All the employees have a sense of urgency and I just feel like they care.  Breakfast is phenomenal and so are the mimosas. I look forward to many more amazing breakfasts there."}
{"text":"This place cannot be managed more poorly. Food was wonderful, our waitress was perfect, but the management killed the whole experience. The food took too long to come out. The wait is ridiculous and the most disturbing part is when we finally got seated, there were about 5 tables open for all those poor people standing out in the heat to sit at! I really don't feel like the food was worth the 55 min wait, but to each his own. Just know you will wait a while!"}
{"text":"We have been to Morning Squeeze several times. It has never disappointed. The food is always good, the service friendly and lively, and the place has a colorful uniqueness of its own.  Of the many places we have eaten in Old Town Scottsdale, this is one we keep going back to. Everything I have had there has been really good, but one of my very top favorites is their Scottsdale's Finest Hash. It's different. It's delicious. It may well be the finest, a fair claim on their part.  Yes, we're fans!"}
{"text":"29MAR  10:00am I am torn on how to rate, so let me start like this: Our service was excellent.  Hostess greeted us very friendly and sat us right away.  Lucky timing because there was a wait when we left.  Our server Alex was awesome.  She was very friendly, checked on food as the kitchen was slow without having to ask, kept water filled without asking, was prompt and attentive, suggested another round of bloodies when the first was gone.  All in all she was excellent, and I would recommend anyone ask for her.  Service = 5 stars Food was excellent, even though the monte cristo was slightly overdone.  Wife had a build your own breakfast sandwich on a croissant that she said was outstanding.  She raved about the garlic fries, and was very happy with the food.  5 Bloodies, sammy, monte, side bacon - Bill total $76.37.  Not your average cheap breakfast for 2.  Food = 4 stars (monte cristo)  Here is where I am struggling.  This restaurant was DIRTY.  The table was \"clean\" (just don't moved the salt and pepper), but the booth seats were anything but.  I realized this is the case after watching the busser.  He simply wipes off the table- Does not move the salt/pepper/condiments - wipes around them, and pushes everything off the edge of the table, onto chairs and the floor.  No bother to wipe off the chairs or booth seats.  This explains the booth cleanliness.  Add to this, where we sat, there was a shelf that ran along the back of the booths, right at the top edge of the booths.  Looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a month.  You could see where people had mistakenly ran their arms or hands along it.  BIG MISTAKE as you would immediately need to go wash them.  Also, on the wall above us was a vase that had lemons and limes.  It too was covered in dirt and dust.  all I can say here is At least our silverware, plates, and and glasses were clean!  Cleanliness - 0 stars  The real icing on the cake was the manager.  I believe I was told her name is Leslie.  She was expediting/running food.  When she brought out ours, she auctioned it off.  This is a big pet peeve of mine at any restaurant.  She dropped off the food and turned around and walked away.  Either she couldn't carry everything, or she forgot the fries and bacon, because a couple minutes later she appeared with the missing items.  Again just dropped the plates and walked off.  No bother to ask if she could get us anything else.  No smile.  No \"Enjoy\".  Nothing.  Thank goodness our server Alex appeared right away as we needed a couple things - ketchup, jelly (this was listed on the menu as coming with the monte cristo, so this was not a special request - Leslie just missed it), etc.  We were seated in a place (table 53) I could look right down the food line where Leslie was expoing.  She never smiled.  Never said please or thank you.  I watched her run food to several tables.  Sure enough, she just auctions stuff off and walks away.  One table actually said \"excuse me\", then again quite loudly, \"excuse me\" to which she turned around and said \"Yes?\"  They asked for hot sauce.  You could tell by the look on her face she was irritated.  She goes and gets it, drops it off and walks off.  No \"anything else?\" or \"Enjoy you food\". Nothing.  This has to be one of the WORST examples of leading by example, and how to treat customers.  How this woman is employed in a service capacity is beyond me.   I was actually going to ask to speak to a manager, about the cleanliness, our awesome server Alex, and the food runner.  To my dismay, Alex told us leslie was the manager when I asked.   Oh well.   0 stars  This is an excellent opportunity for the owner to do some THOROUGH coaching and teaching with the bussers, and with Leslie.  People come to a restaurant for food.  They do or don't come back for a myriad of other reasons.  I would return, only after a thorough cleaning, on a day that Alex was working and Leslie was not."}
{"text":"Laura is the best bar girl! Makes my coffee perfect every time  I love this little place, unique and cute. Plus they have cute shirts."}
{"text":"Too bad the wonderful food was ruined by horrible service. From asking for a table to being waited on - horrible experience. You should never have to feel uncomfortable in a restaurant."}
{"text":"First impression: This place is super cute and bright, and put me in a good mood upon entry. Their menu looked amazing, and their signature cocktails were delicious (tried the AZ Hound Dog and something with strawberries and basil).  Last impression: Disappointing service ruins everything. I pushed away my food, because I didn't like it, and it sat there for over half an hour without any staff inquiring why it was  uneaten. One employee did a check-back without eye contact, and walked away before I could utter a word about the item. The check was automatically dropped, as if they were trying to avoid any further interaction. We would have at least ordered more drinks, but instead left feeling unwanted."}
{"text":"Amazing experience!!! Thank you.. they definitely need my help.    Food solid,  timely, our friendly server Jessica was awesome!! They have killer breakfast tacos..Pea really took care of us and made sure that we had an amazing time. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Food was cold and over cooked. Biscuits taste like Bisquick and gravy was blah. The one good thing it had going for it was the good service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Bad service - still sitting here waiting for breakfast 45 minutes after ordering. It's breakfast, simple omelet."}
{"text":"It wasn't far fetched yesterday. I was there. I was wanting to go back but was reminded about the so so food and uncleanliness due to the dogs. Not washing hands is a must in the food and beverage industry!!!"}
{"text":"The service was left to be desired.  As friendly as they were, it didn't warrant an hour wait for sandwiches and salads.  Meat-preferences weren't delivered correctly and the fries were soggy.  Albeit we ordered lunch items, we should have saved this place for breakfast so see if the 4-star Yelp rating could have held true."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Didn't even get a chance to eat because I waited for 6 minutes without being acknowledged by a server. The hostess asks me if I would like a booth or a table, I say booth and she sighs and acts like the world is ending. This place looks like your typical over priced Scottsdale joint with bimbos as waitresses who can't crack a smile. By the way, when did apple juice become as expensive as grey goose? $5 for a glass of juice? Seriously? I could buy two huge jugs of apple juice at costco for $5. I am glad they waitresses didn't serve me, f this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Get Tara as bartender or server she's amazing and super nice! This place has a Great service and awesome food for breakfast! And it's close to campus"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great, good music and really awesome decor. I had the VW Squeeze - egg, avocado, sliced turkey and havarti cheese piled on a delicious pretzel bun, a side of fresh fruit and a choice of potato. The hash browns were underwhelming. My boyfriend got the breakfast potatoes and they were amazing. Next time I'd definitely get those. Also, the iced nectarine green tea is awesome. Straight up. :) I have to agree with some of the comments about the coffee being super bitter. Dad in law's girlfriend put seven sugars in it and the whole bit of cream and said she couldn't even taste the cream or sugar. Yikes!! Total bill for four people was $37 (before tip-Dad in Law and his girlfriend eat like birds) so not too bad! The little bar/patio was nice, a little chilly after they turned off the warmers, but there were a bunch of two-seaters and four-seaters so there was room. We went at a great time, though. As we were leaving there was a line waiting out the door. Good thing the weather was great :)"}
{"text":"Great. Fast and very friendly service. Food was good, ordered omelets, French toast, the basics. Sat outside w/ kids.  Also went on a Sunday at 9am, during spring training time, and wait was 20 mins not bad and not an issue.   Oh they do allow pets in their patio so if that's an issue for you dont go but when we were there, there was only 1 pup there no biggie deal at all!)"}
{"text":"We went to the soft opening today at the Morning Squeeze in Tempe on Mill. What a delight! Can't wait to go to this location in Scottsdale! The food and service was wonderful! Don't miss their wonderful crepes! I think you should give them a try as I found this wonderful! Hope to see you soon! Thanks Tara for your awesome service today!"}
{"text":"Despite the winning location on Scottsdale road and the semi-open air setup, this was without a doubt the worst service I received in my life.  Many times over the course of over 45 minutes, I was told my order was on its way.   I'd have to think long and hard to recall the last time a patron who arrived after me was served before me but in this instance it occurred multiple times.  My order was as simple as it gets - a fit bowl of brown rice, quinoa and chicken.  So much time had lapsed that even though the hostess mentioned she wouldn't charge me, I felt it was time to get up and leave.  I told her I needed to go and relayed to a colleague to tell the kitchen to put the item in a to-go bag whenever it was finished being prepped.  About two minutes later, after nearly an hour in total, my item came and I exited out the door.  When I opened the box and saw the food, I was shocked at how something that easy to prep could take so long.  The apology I received is appreciated but unfortunately does not make up for this horrible experience.  I have to leave one star."}
{"text":"Since Morning Squeeze sent the Yelp police after me, I will remove my original review which was true and accurate. All I will leave is this part; \"I used to like Morning Squeeze, but something terrible has happened to this place.\" I will never set foot in this place since they decided to go after me instead of addressing the issues I posted."}
{"text":"Good food rating but the service is awful ! Waiting 25 min for breakfast and when I stepped away from the table for 5 min they thought I left ?! And had to wait another 15 min to redo it . So not a good experience as far as service"}
{"text":"This place is great!  They even have a part of their patio designated for people with dogs!  Great service, great food, and if the line's too long here (which it has been a couple times we've stopped by), there are more great brunch spots within walking distance."}
{"text":"A great new addition to Old Town Scottsdale! As one of my coworkers said, this is the type of the place she would go when she is on vacation. Luckily, we live and work in a resort community, so we can go here all the time.  Morning Squeeze specializes in breakfast and lunch. It is brightly decorated with colorful booths inside, a square bar that can be accessed from the inside or from the dog friendly patio. The wait staff are very friendly and are willing to answer all of your questions about the menu, but be nice, they deal with enough jerks who are either hungover or still drunk from the night before in Scottsdale.  I've tried both breakfast and lunch items so far and found everything to be delicious although my coworker noted that her crab cakes could be a little crisper. My favorite so far are the Eggs Benedict.  Morning Squeeze also prides itself on a large selection of Bloody Mary's for those who want a kick start to the day.  If you like to eat out for breakfast this is definitely a place to add to the regular rotation."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but horrible service! Our waitress barely came around & gave us attitude when we were ordering. I think Tawny was her name?"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious and locally sourced food! My husband had the Biscuits N Gravy Breakfast which had 4 biscuits with country gravy and scrambled eggs with the country potatoes. I had the Foxy Lox Down Scramble which had smoked salmon, capers, red onion, and tomatoes. I also had the County potatoes which had medium sized chunks of multi-colored bell peppers and onion. For drinks he had the mocha and I had the large Dirty Chai which was creamy and delicious. We sat on the dog-friendly patio which was the perfect temperature for a hoodie mid-December & thoroughly enjoyed people watching and the antics of the local birds. The decor is bright and cheery, yet the bathrooms are very dark and subdued which makes for quite the contrast! Thoroughly enjoyable experience which makes me wish that we lived closer!"}
{"text":"What a joke! My friend and I just visited the Morning Squeeze. We just sat there and waited for our food for 45 mins! (oat meal and an omelet) and finally left without eating.  We waited at first for about 15 minutes before the waitress said our order was 'on they way'. She said the same thing a few more times for the next 30 mins before we decided to just leave.  As we left, I spoke to the hostess and explained that we could no longer wait. I asked her if she wanted to me to pay for our drinks- a coffee and and orange juice. She said 'no' and that she was 'sorry'.  But as we left, and walked across the street, the waitress screamed out to us that we didn't pay our bill and ran across the street to us - bill in hand. We explained that hostess said out bill was taken care of. She argued with us that the hostess was 'not the boss'. We offered to walk back before she grudgingly accepted that we were dissatisfied with our experience. Unbelievable. We won't return.  Now reading the other 'bad service reviews'  here on Yelp and seeing this is not uncommon."}
{"text":"I've always liked morning squeeze but the last 3 times have been well below par. The most recent and last time my omelette was burnt toast burnt and my fiancé burger that was supposed to be medium was well done. I could go on but what's the point. The service has gone down as well. I'm very surprised they allowed the omelette to come out as you could clearly see it was burnt. Disappointing because it's got great decorum and used to be good food great service."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The service could use a little polishing."}
{"text":"Very attentive service when sitting at bar.  However kitchen definitely has long ticket times..even when not that busy."}
{"text":"This is sad for me to do because this place used to be my favorite spot. Their new menu just does not do it for me. I understand they wanted to skinny down the menu since they had so many items. They left off some of my favorites, peach blossom protein smoothie, Waldorf chicken salad, etc.   I tried to give the new menu a shot but the skinny down lunch had little to pick from and even on item that I finally did select they were out of (Waldorf sand which), fewer menu items should allot for them to always be available. I think got the steak sandwich, MISTAKE. It was covered in creamy blue cheese sauce and a ton of arugula. I knew the sand which came with it but it was over powering the steak and just sloppy. Also the fruit side was a joke. 4 pieces of fruit that were basically all Rhine.   Wasn't surprised that the place was no longer that busy at lunch as I won't be either."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Shared a bagel and cream chz, Cali benne and some fruit. I'm not a big breakfast person but I tasted everything. I really like dining In the morning on the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"My family and I came in and it took a long time to get seated with no wait, and we weren't greeted at the table for 10 minutes. The eggs benedict was not poached and the sauce had no flavor. My dad found a hair in his food and a server watched as we pulled it out and she said NOTHING. I will not be coming back ever again."}
{"text":"Delicious! No complaints. They didn't have that long of a wait for brunch so we enjoyed a nice brunch on the patio!"}
{"text":"With so many great places to eat in Scottsdale, I would skip this place. We ordered breakfast and it took over an hour for the food to come out. The staff was not very friendly and the food was just ok...definitely not worth the long wait. I would suggest Breakfast Club instead which has better food and a friendly staff. Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Meh.. nice location and trendy. The food is average and the service was good. Average I would say. I like the wimpsical style. Not sure I would go again. Breakfast should be economical."}
{"text":"Great setting, very friendly staff and food was delicious. We were in Scottsdale for a couples weekend and ended up going back here twice for breakfast. Southwestern feel to the food made us feel right at home in Arizona, coffees were great too."}
{"text":"This place is seriously the best breakfast joint in Old Town Scottsdale. Their Green Chili is awesome! Cami was our server and she is fantastic! We just moved to Scottsdale and have eaten at a bunch of restaurants already since we are huge foodies :)  Love the ambiance and the prices are very reasonable. It can get crowded, but that's because it's so good! I love sitting at the counter and the booths. Outside area is cool too. We will be eating here a lot! Go check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had brunch at Morning Squeeze yesterday.  My friends and I had a great time!  The portions were huge!  The food was great!  We ordered a western omelet, egg sandwich, and biscuits and gravy.  We also had hibiscus mimosas! I enjoyed my brunch and plan to return soon!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. That really is all there is to say. Since I have to fill a minimum word count... I can say I had to get up to refill our coffees, 3 of 4 meals were cold when they showed up and had to be re made and I had to go to bar to get our check. Never going back.. It's breakfast... Easy meal to make so if service is bad there is no point. The entire staff should spend the day working at Denny's to see what attentive service looks like."}
{"text":"Very sub-par.  My husband ordered the protein pancakes, I'm fairly sure something in them was rancid, possibly the flaxseeds, they just did not taste good.  I has the Cali Bennie, the hollandaise was thick and very over cooked, in general the dish lacked seasoning and the fruit served with is was quite underripe...  Just not a fan of this place."}
{"text":"My friend and I always turn to yelp and reviews to try new restaurants because we don't like chain restaurants too much. Well the reviews did help. We loved our food and service and price. Definitely coming back.."}
{"text":"Stopped in to the new morning squeeze in Tempe and loved it! They have a screaming good deal on mimosas for the summer, $3.99 for a FLIGHT!"}
{"text":"Just went there this morning around 11 when it was very busy. We got sat rather quickly and waitress was very good, but the floors were extremely dirty and food came out cold. My wife had cold and hard French toast which is hard to mess up. I would choose a different place if you are going to breakfast on the weekends in old town"}
{"text":"Positively the best breakfast in town. It is wide open with a cool patio. Best to go when it's not blazing hot outside. Mimosas and Marys are perfect on a Sunday.   Good start to a day on bikes going to bars in downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Grabbing brunch with the family. They said it would be like a 15min. wait, but it was maybe only 5 so that was great! The hostesses were extremely pleasant, & seemed genuinely happy to be at work.  We were seated and the guy taking our order was very attentive, and great with refills. The only reason I'm not giving the service a five star is because it took more than 45min for our food to come out. Once it came out all was forgiven because it was nice and hot, & so delicious.  I ordered a omelette & so did everyone else at our table. Everyone was happy with their choices. I didn't get hash browns, but I  heard they are great!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service! A girl name Eunice was very helpful and friendly and made me feel welcome."}
{"text":"Food was less than stellar.  Staff was friendly, but food took forever.   Pricing was on par."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in old town. I prefer the bar cause I'm always attended to by Laura. Super cool always makes me feel welcomed. Great food, great selection and great service. What else can you ask for..."}
{"text":"My husband and I (from Denver) went to brunch at Morning Squeeze on Friday. We sat at the bar with another couple, our friends who live locally in Paradise Valley. I really enjoyed the pleasant atmosphere with the restaurant open to the street. Our server was very friendly and attentive to everything. I had The Belfer Fit Bowl with shredded pork and avocado. My husband had the Breakfast Tacos. Both entrees were delicious and filling!!! We will definitely eat at Morning Squeeze again next time we're in town and will probably order the same thing because it was so good. I highly recommend Morning Squeeze!!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably a beautiful place to come and eat some food and enjoy asu campus basically. They have 3.99 mimosa flights which will make you super excited with a amc theater right across the street if you want to enjoy a movie after a amazing brunch. They have great egg Benedict's and they have great huevos rancheros which all this food is vegetarian and it will not let you down. They have outdoor seating with steam showers and they have a indoor seating also and close at 230 pm on Sunday which is awesome. They are right in the hub asu campus so for lunch brunch they are busy. They have many tables available and if you check in and write a review they give you a mint chocolate crepe. Me and my girl friend came here to enjoy the outside and try some food out and we are not disappointed at all and we would come back to this awesome location again because they have one in Scottsdale and they have one in Tempe and we are at this location in Tempe. So all I say is come and enjoy some bomb food some mimosa flights and have a great time."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I have been here, but I was following them on my IG account and the food started looking good again. Looks can be deceiving though and this meal wasn't their best performance. I was actually served cold coffee at one point in the meal and besides that the coffee really wasn't that good, fresh or strong. The stack of choc. chip pancakes was slighly overcooked and the pancakes were tough to cut after a few bites. They did include chips baked in, but not the chocolate syrup I saw on my IG account. Also, the first batch of breakfast tacos were cold and the following batch was good, but nothing like we can recall from 2015. This place seems to have fallen behind the big three of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is always packed so had to try it. Had the breakfast tacos with turkey sausage. Very flavorful and good salsa. My bf had eggs Benedict. Although the eggs were cooked perfectly, the hollandaise sauce tasted greasy, rather than buttery, lemony. Too many other good restaurants to go back there"}
{"text":"That place never get my order right !  Including today.. so i talke to the manager and problem WAS NOT fixed.. dont go there if your hungry or if you really enjoy good food..its a cool hangout place but thats about it.. i will never eat there again for sure.. this is my first time on yelp just because of the horrible experience i had today."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale for the first time and this is one of my moms favorite places. Came for breakfast and it wasn't very crowded (me gusta mucho). However, the rest left a lot to be desired. Our waitress was quite impatient (I mentioned it wasn't busy right?) and the food was just...eh. I had breakfast tacos and my mom had, what is essentially, a continental breakfast.   Can't say I'll return, but the atmosphere is very cute!"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere and friendly staff! The breakfast burrito was great except the hash browns. Dry, no taste, and wasn't hot. I will give them another chance in the future."}
{"text":"Absolutely some of the worst service I have ever received. Got seated right away on the patio. Ordered a breakfast sandwich and pancake. 40 minutes later I got the wrong breakfast sandwich and a pancake with no syrup. I sent the sandwich back and asked for syrup. They returned with the wrong sandwich again. After sending it back for the 2nd time, they finally got it right.   The saving grace to it all was the manager came over and said he would take care of the check.   Will not be returning."}
{"text":"It's hard to find something I don't want to eat here, but all the food seems so overwhelming and heavy. Maybe that's just breakfast and why I've avoided it as a meal for so many years. The service is incredibly friendly and attentive. If I had an unlimited budget and didn't have to work afterward, I'd come here all the time. But this is real life! Particularly good vacation/weekend breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast on a Sunday. We waited under 5 minutes for a table for 4. The service was great, and the food was really great. There were lots of different options for people's tastes, and the presentations were very palatable."}
{"text":"What a great place for breakfast!!  The menu has some really great choices and a full bar to boot!  I think this is a perfect place to start a weekend fun day!!  I plan to visit Squeeze every time I an in Old Town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Hostess was super rude!  After getting a text for the table I walked up to the counter, I'd been waiting forever BTW, and 5 minutes from the time they texted my table was given away.   When u asked why the hostess said, 5 minutes is a long time, this is a busy restaurant!  It wasn't friendly, it was degrading.  I asked to speak with a manager.  He never came out to address the issue.  Needless to say, I'm NOT coming back!"}
{"text":"Very comfortable atmosphere with amazing food! Croissant breakfast sandwich is prime time and the service was great! You do have to have a little patience, but worth the wait. Great Bar as well"}
{"text":"Visited for breakfast this morning prior to 8am and the time from order to receiving food was way too long, 30+ minutes for food. Service was below average, food was average. This place has a long way to go to compete with Daily Dose or Breakfast Club on food quality and service. Will not be back, too many other great choices"}
{"text":"Ordered the regular Bloody Mary. Was decently surprised at how great it was! Ordered the Release Grayson and it took some time before it was served to me. By the time we received it, it was cold. So cold I actually had to ask for it to be sent back. The meal that came back only had some newly cooked eggs on top. Otherwise the meal was still very cold. I would not recommend this place or would I come back unless I only wanted a good Bloody Mary. Also, didn't receive any butter for toast or silverware. Staff was too distracted by regulars to care for new customers."}
{"text":"I was in Scotts the week of the WM PGA golf tourney and stopped by this place for breakfast. Service and food was great. Bloody Mary's were also excellent. My 1st time here and I will be back."}
{"text":"Nice staff, quick seating. Ok coffee. Food isn't great, coldish when it comes out and doesn't taste like what you get charged for. Most likely wouldn't come back or recommend this place to anyone. The atmosphere is nice and it has nice look to it. But not good food. I'm from seattle and have high expectations for breakfast spots and good coffee! so maybe i'm wrong. Just wasn't impressed!"}
{"text":"This place is a hip breakfast spot with great food.  My family regularly goes here for the outstanding food; however the service needs a kick in the ass.  A waitress named Briana is prob the best waitress I ever had in ANY breakfast spot in my 14yrs since moving to Scottsdale. However if you get another waitress good luck."}
{"text":"Love the place.   Overall atmosphere is great. Bloody Mary with bacon is amazing. The bar manager or lady working as manager Behind the bar is fabulous and is always concerned with customer service. Think her name is Karen or something like that.   Breakfast burrito is filling. And the Cappuccinos are not bad either."}
{"text":"This place looks so cute and like it would be a great breakfast spot. Unfortunately, had one of the worst services experiences. Never came by to fill up our drinks, when we got our food we never got utensils and had to ask multiple people for them, and all of our orders were missing something that we asked for. We didn't make a fuss about anything though and our meals were mediocre. The food didn't stand out at all. Also, we waited 30 minutes after being done eating (and nobody clearing our plates) we had to go to the host stand to ask for our check. There are so many great breakfast spots nearby that I have no reason to ever go back. I don't know if it was because today is Labor Day and they were understaffed, but had a pretty bad experience and would not come back or recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday for brunch, fairly busy, service was fast and friendly. Bloody Mary's are strong and worth the money. Great food, and atmosphere. Dog friendly patio, and dog specific menu my two pups love. Only downside is the plastic plates."}
{"text":"First timer. Super relaxed, comfy atmosphere . Our server Rubi, was adorable, super friendly and gave great recommendations (huge menu with lots of good options, everything sounded good). Love it when  wait staff is upbeat and cheerful! Glad we stopped in here on our way to the airport."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place. Nice patio (when it's not too hot). Simply an enjoyable place with decent food! I'll definitely be back to try something else and for lunch as well!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast in Scottsdale! The food here is amazing. The hash is the way to go. The service on top of everything is the best in Old Town. The hibiscus mimosa is the bomb.com. Thank you Pea!"}
{"text":"Food looks good but servers, bartenders and waitresses seem tired and non-interested.  Still waiting 30 minutes for my Togo order.  WAiting to post this until food is here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in Old Town! Great food and a pleasant atmosphere! I have never had much of a wait here and have always had great service, friendly and quick. They also have a pet friendly patio which is always a plus. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible experience here. Had to wait endlessly, and when we finally sat the bar had a careless waitress who didn't apologize after our food came in 1 hour. When the food did come it was quite gross (had the steak and eggs). You could taste the old oil from their skillet. Overall not impressed.   I would go to The Breakfast Club over this one anyday."}
{"text":"Long wait for sub par food. In fact, we sat at the bar and waited 40 mins for our order which came out incorrectly. I asked for no cheese on my breakfast tacos and yet they arrived cold and with cheese. The bartender took them back to kitchen and, to my dismay, they just picked the cheese off the top and gave me back original, soggy, cold breakfast tacos. It didn't strike them that there would still be cheese within the eggs/meat, not just the top.  Concerns about allergies and/or customer disliked are anxiously lacking. Wasted about 90 mins of my life here. Left hungry."}
{"text":"Foods good but clearly management isn't managing staff.... waiting constantly on them while they huddle texting in a corner... horrible service!! When she was around she rushed you with her aggressive words, never slowly down to actually listening to the customer.... she clearly didn't want to be servicing customers but rather rush back to texting with coworkers."}
{"text":"This was by far out of the 3 days I stayed in Scottsdale the best.   Good service, good coffee and a nice overall atmosphere.  The food was very good.  People are casual and just was a good time.  I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Probably 4 stars on a normal day but I had such a blast at the Yelp charity brunch they hosted.  Pancakes are genuinely terrific."}
{"text":"This place was packed on a Sunday morning but luckily we snagged a spot at the bar. We could have eaten a dozen of the special deviled eggs they serve (so good!). My breakfast burrito was huge and the eggs Benedict was tasty too. I got a Bloody Mary that was very strong! Friendly servers at the bar. Overall we had a really good breakfast! A little on the pricy side."}
{"text":"Love this breakfast spot and that's saying a lot considering old town is packed with so many great breakfast/brunch places to choose from.  Would have to place it in my top 5 for this category when looking for a great breakfast place in old town.    Staff is quick and responsive especially when your food comes out wrong or contrary to your liking.  This has never happened to me here personally but I have seen it happen to others around me each time I have been here and it is the reason this review is not a 5 star.  Personally I think they just need a better order system or another cook in the back but still a must try despite their shortcomings with orders.  Also, if you plan on coming here during peak breakfast hours on a weekend, forget it!  You will wait for at least a half hour.  But worth it if you have the time."}
{"text":"We came in this afternoon for brunch and went straight to the bar, thinking we would only be getting drinks before meeting up with friends. We decided to stay and bring our friends here instead, so I went up to the hostess (short brown hair, jean vest and dress) to put our names down for a seated table. As I walk up to the hostess table, I had to get her attention because she was on her phone. Hostess 101, your phone shouldn't even be near you, you're getting paid to greet customers who come in. As soon as I got her attention I told her that I would like to place my name down for a table. Instead of asking what my name was and how many people were in my party, she said, no because your party has to all be here. Her tone was especially rude as there are other ways of saying no without sounding obnoxious.  The food was mediocre at best and took over half an hour to be served."}
{"text":"My experience here was okay. Our server was fast, nice and very attentive but the food quality was only okay. I had the original French toast and it was very bland. It tasted like fried bread with syrup. I'm giving this place 3 stars only because of the server we had. I wont be back for their food."}
{"text":"Good but not great. Had a scramble and a latte. There was a big selection with something for everyone but I don't need to go back. Nothing special; got the job done."}
{"text":"Skip this place. Came here awhile back with several other hungry soldiers after taking a PT test. We were ushered to the side upon arrival and multiple other parties were say before us despite several open tables that could accommodate or party.  Food came trickling out after a thirty minute wait. My dish, lox and a bagel, was the last delivered to the table.  A forty minute wait for lox and a bagel. Completely unacceptable.   Informed the server we wanted to see a manager and was brushed off. Eventually they dropped a check with no adjustments. At that point I cut my losses and was just happy to be done with this place. I don't expect any additional service when in uniform, but I do expect to be given the respect of a paying customer."}
{"text":"The Monte Christo was interesting but not for me. None the less I was very impressed with the service drinks and menu in a hip lively atmosphere"}
{"text":"I walked in busy Sunday rush.. The hostess was taking phone order that never seem to end and 3 waitresses walked up to stand and did not speak to myself or the people behind me. The hostess finally put the phone on hold and ask the 3rd waitress for help and she walked off without helping. I understand it's busy Sunday morning but what happen to saying \" Someone will be right with you in moment.. No one said anything..\"   A manager came to hostess desk to ask how many people where in my party.. She did not speak to me to ask how I was doing just straight to business.. I requested table outside as I sitting alone. She said yes you can go out there and handed me the menu... I sat myself...   My waitress - Tesleah was the reason I decided to stay! She was helpful and friendly! Really enjoyed her service.   The food.. I did not enjoy the ranchero Omelette.. I did sub out the pork for chicken.. The chicken was burnt.. I will not get this again.. I do not recommend it. My waitress gave me water to go!   I did go in restroom.. one stall was not working and the other one would not flush..   Maybe different day would be better"}
{"text":"One of the worst breakfast experiences ever!     The service was extremely slow and my food came out rubbery and cold. But that probably had something to do with the fact that it sat up on the counter for five minutes... Which we watched happen. Not only did several servers walk by our food with the ticket ready and keep walking but so did the manager, twice!  Finally, since we were in a rush we went and found the server standing at the hostess stand and told her our food was ready.  My friends French toast was cold so she had to send it back. Unfortunately, I had some place to be so I just didn't eat my food, I sent it back. My eggs were rubbery and brown and my hashbrowns (which I ordered extra crispy) were cold and not crispy.  The manager was a jerk, when we complained he walked over and said \"you guys are complaining already ha ha Ha...\" . He was unprofessional, never came over and apologized, and we watched him touch his face at least 10 times while he was expediting food. Ewww! He should not be running a restaurant, this is the reason this place is a disaster and gets terrible reviews on yelp. Luckily all was not lost because I was in good company!   My advice, wait the extra time for the breakfast club or go to McDonald's you have a way better experience either way."}
{"text":"Went to Morning Squeeze for the first time. Prior to going I saw the Yelp rating of 3 stars so I wasn't expecting much. I split a breakfast burrito and butter milk pancakes. The coffee was fresh and never had to ask for a refill. The breakfast burrito was very good and a good size to share. It came with potatoes which were cold and we asked for hotter ones but when they came those weren't much better. The pancakes were average and dry. The service was great!"}
{"text":"Hovering between 3 and 4 stars, staff was great, and I hesitate to judge the food on a single visit.  I had the build your own sandwich choosing the options of Canadian bacon and scrambled eggs on sourdough and while $7 at a restaurant isn't outrageous the bacon while good was the size of a silver dollar, combining the eggs and single piece of bacon covered less than 30% of bread were equivalent to a small side dish this was not a sandwich, it came with a tiny orange slice...and I drove past McDonald's on the way because...well the wait staff was nice."}
{"text":"Although my experience here, has not been the best service or the worst, I have never had a better Monte Cristo. The second time we went here, the owner did however go out of his way to not only bring us a free waffle while we waited, he also gave us a bill credit. I will definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"I'm going to give Morning Squeeze a strong three star review. The decor of this place is really fun and funky. It's got a open space, lot of light, and bright colors, which I always enjoy.   I ordered the Friends with Bennies (or Bennies with Friends, whatever). It was an eggs benedict with shrimp and lobster, with hash browns and a couple slices of fruit. I think it came out to about $14, before tax. The food was all right, though I thought the eggs were overdone (which, next time, I would just order as poached over easy. Simple fix).  The portions are small. In my case, I'm not sure if that's a bad thing, because I never finish my food (and cleared my plate at Morning Squeeze), but I could see others being disappointed. I guess I would have liked a bit more for $14, but since I was having lobster with my breakfast, so should I complain? Not really.  I have one peeve about Morning Squeeze (and it is nit-picky, I'm aware) and that was that the hostess that sat us down was wearing a see through blouse with a black bra. Typically, this type of styling doesn't bother me in the least, but it's not what I am looking for at 9:30 for breakfast on a weekday. Does this make me a 25-year-old fuddy duddy? Maybe.  In closing, I'd be game to try Morning Squeeze again, but I didn't experience a \"Wow!\" factor my first time in.   Hope this helps, happy eating!"}
{"text":"We visit Scottsdale several times a year and decided to stray from our routine of eating at Daily Dose and try this place on a recommendation we received. After looking at the pictures of the eggs benedict online we decided to give this place a shot. We went to the restaurant on Monday morning around 8:30 am. Service was meh, kind of slow, especially for not being busy. Took about 10 minutes from the time we put in an order for coffee for the waitress to come back and ask what we would like to order for breakfast. She was visibly standing chit chatting with another server. After we were done eating it took about 15-20 minutes to get the check.   We ordered 2 coffees, a build your own breakfast sandwich (English muffin, cheese, fried egg, sausage, and American cheese), and pulled pork benedict.  The 2 coffees were fine, not the best tasting restaurant coffee. It became much worse when I got to the bottom of my coffee and ended up with a mouth full of coffee grinds because they had poured me the bottom of the pot. The build your own breakfast sandwich was good. The \"fruit cup\" that comes on the side can barely be classified as a fruit cup. It should be called a fruit garnish. I received a couple measly pieces of cantaloupe and melon and count them, two slices, not pieces, but thin slices of strawberries and 4 blueberries. The amount of fruit in the cup didn't even cover the bottom of the bowl they serve them in. It'd look better to just put them on the side of the sammie, it doesn't need it's own serving dish. There's not enough in there to warrant it. Now for the worst part of the meal. The pulled pork benedict. I'm not really even sure why they would send the plate out the way they did, but the \"poached\" eggs were not poached. There weren't even egg whites to be seen on the plate, well there were...but they weren't cooked. The plate looked like egg soup, like someone forgot to cook the egg and just cracked two raw ones on top of the benedict. The entire plate was mush. After it took so long to even take our order and not really ever seeing our waitress again we ate the pork and the english muffin and pushed the slop to the side.  Would not go back to this restaurant; not when there are more consistent and dependable breakfast places within 2 blocks. 2 stars for the breakfast sammie and the orange juice which we ordered after the meal because \"there has to be some redeeming quality about this place right?\""}
{"text":"Here in town and got recommended this place, atmosphere is adorable! It's tiny and has a nice patio to sit and enjoy the view and weather.   Favorite feature is definitely the coffee cups on the wall behind the hostess.   It wasn't busy so we got seated fast and greeted and drinks to us quickly.   Service was good, not rude but not overly friendly it was quick and easy.   Food was very good! I had the biscuits and gravy with turkey sausage. Cooked good and gravy had a very rich taste.     Definitely a place I'll come when I visit."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Terrible food. All around terrible. The food was cold and took forever and tasted horrible. I could barely eat my food and taking the check took almost 20 minutes. They forgot half our order and when it came it wasn't even worth it."}
{"text":"The service was bad. We went to watch the soccer game as they advertised in their Facebook page that they are open for World Cup matches. But they didn't have the sound on and we had to ask them 5 times in order to get the volume higher. Meanwhile they were playing music as well and it just made it too noisy. The food was just ok. Too expensive for what you getting. Nothing special.  The design is pretty cool and new tho!"}
{"text":"Disgusting, horrible service,  servers know nothing about the food , menu, or even how to serve. We ordered a lox scramble minus capers and we received the scramble with capers and when we mentioned it to the server her exact words were, \"what are capers.\" Wow, way to train your staff. When I asked about the avocado appetizer, she said I don't know anything about it I'm new. Seriously?? On top of that another person in out party ordered a crepe and a parfait, the crepe was cold and dry and disgusting, and the parfait came with a spoon with dried oatmeal on it. And the prices??? 4$ for a side of bacon,"}
{"text":"The food is some what good but kind of pricey for a plate of pancakes that my bf ordered. I got a weird egg and chicken veggie combo not the best veggie with eggs i've had. The orange juice was freshly squeeze and good. I've only eaten here once but i will stick to my cheap pancake eateries that serve giant pancakes for less than what i paid and taste better. Sorry."}
{"text":"Very disappointing!  Will never go back!!!  I ordered the smoked pork Benedict. It was not smoked pork but rather BBQ pork drenched in BBQ sauce and topped with an egg and sauce. It was cold and NOT GOOD. The breakfast tacos were ordinary, and the \"best Scottsdale hash\" was not fresh and mostly consisted of potatoes. My daughter had the breakfast burrito and she thought is was okay. I will say that the sour dough toast was really good but if you want it buttered, you need to request butter and jam. The hot chi was good as well. If you want really good hash, the tap house kitchen the the BEST Scottsdale Hash by far. This place won't be on my list of good breakfast places. There are to many good ones in the area that make the cut."}
{"text":"I had the breakfast Tacos, and was surprised how big and over stuffed they were.  I was only able to finish 2 of the 3 tacos.  I'm looking forward to trying their egg on an avocado and adding a side of chorizo! OJ was perfect, no pulp. Several people were having a jump start to their day with cocktails and even wine. Good feel and doesn't feel overwhelming and loud like the breakfast club up the street."}
{"text":"Great new place in downtown Tempe. I'll come back when I'm in town next time. I recommend"}
{"text":"I went for breakfast. Great location and space. Open air, nicely decorated with old fashioned booths, bar chairs and combination of colors. The servers are excellent being attentive, prompt and just friendly. I had steak and eggs and was disappointed in the NY strip as it was very thin, a little tough and just not tasty. I was not looking for Ruth Chris steak at diner prices but I would recommend not ordering their NY strip. I also ordered an Americano coffee which has an up charge. This reminded me of hotel room coffee. Airplane coffee is better. In summary only three stars because their coffee is generic weak coffee and the steak was disappointing."}
{"text":"I had the steak and eggs which I would highly recommend you don't get.  Eggs (over easy) were the runniest I've ever seen eggs.  The egg water flooded my plate as soon as I put my fork in it.  There seemed to be a lot of butter somewhere on my plate too, so I had a pool there by the end of it..  The meat wasn't terrible, but no seasoning to speak of.  Not the greatest cut of meat.  And I had to rip through it with the butter knife too which I thought was odd..  My friend got a sausage and mushroom omelet.  It was decent.  I don't think I like the hashed browns but the country potatoes were solid.  I would like to try the egg white omelets they have before final judgement, but definitely never getting eggs over easy again!"}
{"text":"Sat for 10 minutes at the counter at a very unbusy time...not a whisper of service.. The server at the counter was too busy flirting and chatting with a gentleman..ok I'll go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Best Monte Cristo sandwich in the valley. Period. Always busy but that means great people watching. Patio is dog friendly which is admittedly bizarre for a place that serves food but hey if you are the kind of weirdo who orders menu items for your dog then this is right up your alley. Oh yeah they have a part of the menu for dogs. Welcome to 2017 everyone."}
{"text":"Visiting my son in Scottsdale, he took me out for breakfast!  I had a flight to catch and the wait was 40 min...The hostess took us after about a 20 minute wait!!!  The food was awsome!  I had an omlette with avocados, the veggies in the omlette were fresh and plentiful!!!  The staff was quick and efficient as well.  The only one thing I would comment on is the dirty floor, it was so sticky my shoes would not move.  Thank you for the great experience! Kathy O."}
{"text":"Morning squeeze is a cute little breakfast and lunch place that when you first walk in is a fun carefree atmosphere. So why did I give it just two stars? We were seated in front of the open faced kitchen in a booth and there were only about two other groups in the restaurant. Briana, our server, came over three minutes later with water. Asked if we needed anything to drink. We asked for coffee and orange juice and waited another 7 minutes for it to arrive. We finally get to order. I got a side of biscuits and gravy for $4 and an egg scrambled for $1.50. My friend ordered sausage patties for $4  and we split a Belgium waffle for $6. We were pretty pleased with the prices. So Briana put in our order and we waited. And waited. And waited. Our food was ready in the window less than 3 feet from our table for 10 minutes while our server was up at the front counter with the hostess. We watched our food get cold and even contemplated going and picking it up from the window ourselves. Finally our server walked up to the window and grabbed our food turned around and handed it to us. My biscuits turned out great and the waffle was amazing. The sausage patties though we're roughly the size oft he face on my watch. Tiny. For the same price as the giant biscuits and gravy. We ate and finished most of it. Then a busser came by and took our plates. We didn't see our server for another 8 minutes after we finished. She finally came by to give us our check and we got our our cards and gave them to her to avoid waiting for her again. She paid us out and said good bye. We gave her a 20% tip that she did not deserve and left. On the way out the cooks yelled from the kitchen to have a great day and that was probably the best service we received the whole time we were there. The food was decent but it really didn't make up for the rest. My friend and I are both servers and we understand a lot when it comes to this kind of stuff. But Briana was terrible. And we can say for sure we will never go back to Morning Squeeze."}
{"text":"Third time here and disappointment continues.  Slow and inattentive service, food comes out incomplete or cold.   Definitely the last time."}
{"text":"Once we were seated, it took our waitress 20 minutes to come to our table. We ordered and then waited 30 minutes for our food!  It's breakfast!  That's what your restaurant serves, so learn to manage your time and get your kitchen staff to learn how to cook in a reasonable time. This is restaurant basics. The poor waitress aren't to blame for the kitchen but they are to blame for not coming to our table once we were seated. Come one morning squeeze, get your act together. It's not like you just opened."}
{"text":"So here we are on a holiday weekend, haven't been to Morning Squeeze in awhile, let's go.  We decided to sit on patio because it wasn't crowded at all, nice change.  Server was quick, and took our drink order, came right back with water & coffee, next our food order, didn't take long.  The food was ok, nothing to write home about.  Server never came back to fill our coffees.   Sad, cuz I wanted another cup, and really never saw much of her.  So I had to get my Tabasco from another table.  Now I'm getting annoyed.     As I eat, I can see the girls behind the bar chatting it up & laughing.   Then I spot our server, Cami, she does not see me.   As I try to get her attention, I see her literally popping a zit on the bartenders shoulder, right in plain view of God & everyone!   I dropped my fork, told my friend, and we were done.  Cami finally shows with our bill, we take it to the cashier, and walk out.    BTW, I watched as Cami delivered food & coffee to other tables, she never went to wash her hands.   Needless to say, we will never be back.  Ewww!"}
{"text":"Food ambiance were very good.  Tainted by service.  No butter given with toast or pancakes.  Should be given not by request only.  Staff should not congregate at hostess station.  did not want to interrupt her conversation at hostess station to ask for it. Other than that would return and recommenr"}
{"text":"Bomb food! Alicia Rene was on her game! Thanks for a great dining experience morning squeeze!"}
{"text":"So went last week and didn't review because every new restaurant needs to work out the kinks.  I came in today, went to bar and sat for 10 mins, no water, no menu, no greet! So i packed up and let the hostess know about my situation. \"Sorry, thanks for coming in\"  ahhhhh am I missing something!  The only good thing about this place is the OJ is like crack and it's always under shade (not like my attitude) but it's cover completely #nosun I know it's summer and it's slow but pick up guys/gals."}
{"text":"Too long of a wait for table and then again for food...only to then have it arrive cold.   Based on their reaction this is not a unique experience. I will not return."}
{"text":"Ventured down to Old Town for Sunday Breakfast only to be disappointed!  It's the middle of summer in the desert and like fools we agreed to sit on the patio as it was packed and hoping it wouldn't be miserable.. Given that I am almost 7 months pregnant we had to be asked to move inside mid-way! The hostess handled our situation with a pleasant grace and our original server was very sweet about the change.  When our food arrived they forgot my husbands toast and then he realized that his omelette was not the one he ordered.  So I are without him and then waited for him to eat once his correct omelette came. He also had ordered hash browns but got country potatoes. Both of our egg dishes needed seasoning.. All in all it was pretty bland breakfast.  I highly doubt we will ever return!"}
{"text":"Great patio for an early morning AZ breakfast. The food and service are good. People watch while drinking your coffee and mimosa. Cheers!"}
{"text":"We recently adopted a dog and brought him on our Spring Break vacation.  We looked for dog friendly restaurants where we could take him.  This one did not disappoint.  They loved our little guy and treated him just like any of their guests.  The food was great and the staff was very friendly.  The only reason I gave this a 4 star instead of a 5 is because their regular drinks are a little on the pricey side.  I love the quaint atmosphere and the menu was great!  Lots to choose from.  Will visit again!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC BREAKFAST!! Giant cudos to a breakfast spot that offers multiple milk alternatives for my coffee!! This morning I went with coconut and it was divine.   My meal was the protein pancakes. I find it to be a happy medium between pancakes and a healthy breakfast like a protein shake. They were YUMMY!  They were massive fluffy and had a hint of vanilla and cinnamon.   My fiancé had a southwestern omelet that came out looking stunning. Fresh avocado, pulled pork and a sauce that forced me to reach over and snag a bite.   Apart from the great food and beverage options the environment is great. The music isn't too loud to have a conversation so this is now added to my list of breakfast spots for business meetings. For a fun breakfast spot it hits all the marks on decor and environment as well. It's bright happy and the staff is sweet attentive and kind. All the things you need when you are heading out for breakfast or brunch.   As for adding this to the Mill area it is a huge win! The area was in need of something like this!  Also did I mention a dog friendly patio?!  I LOVE when the patio is dog friendly! It makes breakfast that much better.   A must stop in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Had the Bloody Mary, wild berry parfait and classic eggs Benedict. Everything was amazing ! I wish I lived around here because I would be here every day. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Should've been skeptical coming here in the first place with a 3 star rating but I've never been and I figured I'd give a diff breakfast place a chance(RnR my first choice) Service started off pretty good then quickly declined after the first interaction. Order a $10.25 Bloody Mary with coronita that was mostly tomato juice. Before I even ordered my food I specifically asked if I wanted the Cross Fit but wanted a protein pancake if I can substitute the toast for one. You can probably guess what kind of pancake came when my food arrived.(not the protein) After all that I decided to play it safe and order a beer. There's no way you can get that wrong right? My IPA comes with a \"bottled date and enjoy by date\" bottled 04/2016 and 07/2016. No biggie I can see how a server or bar tender might not notice that. So I take it up to the bar and show the bar tender the date and she looks at it and says \"that's 2018\" I laughed and walked away. Being a bar tender or anyone with common sense knows bottled beer isn't water and wouldn't be good TWO YEARS from now. And the picture I took clearly shows the 2016 date it was bottled and the 2016 date it's good by is the same. Get employees that enjoy working on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"I was seated right away, place was pretty busy but it seems folks truly enjoy sitting outside.   Well I have to say the food was good.  The service was ok, right when I got antsy our coffee finally arrived.  Our waitress was courteous, but she was never around to ask the normal questions about the food.  We pretty much were left alone, I noticed at the end she was also working on the north patio which tells me why our service was ok, Morning Squeeze doesn't have enough servers to be efficient and provide that extra mmmphh for the dining experience.  Now to the food, my girlfriend ordered the breakfast tacos and they were pretty good, but not popping.  I ordered the Crossfit with pulled pork, pretty good stuff. Wherein layeth the problem with the kitchen, my egg scramble was steaming when I got it, but my hash browns were damn cold.  So they got done fast and weren't under a heat lamp and just sat.  Then we shared a nutella and banana crepe...it was good, but it was not a crepe.  Crepes are thin, this was just a thinner pancake and, and then it stated on the menu we can put any topping on it...but it was add any topping.  I've paid ten dollars for a crepe before and that wasn't a ten dollar crepe.    As I said, food was good, service just made it, cold hash browns annoyed me and I can see why there are so many poor reviews."}
{"text":"We were driving by and saw lots of people at the restaurant and thought we try it. We had to wait about 10 minutes but it was well worth it. The breakfast was fantastic, there were lots of choices. They even gave us a complimentary cornflake waffle which was out of this world!"}
{"text":"This place is cute and trendy, however seeing that they keep an open gallon of milk on the sink that they been using to make their lattes makes me wonder how their kitchen hygiene is here.  The juices in a tray with NO ice.  People can get really sick from having latte with bad milk. I was going to order one until I saw where they keep their milk for the lattes."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place to enjoy breakfast in the Valley!  I absolutely love that the patio is pet friendly and they actually have a tail waggers menu for our furry friend...and she loved it (eggs, turkey and cheese).  The OJ is fresh squeezed and to die for.  I tried the ab cruncher (egg white omelette with chicken, tomatoes and spinach)...seriously healthy and good!  You may have to wait, but trust me it is worth it!"}
{"text":"The staff was very accommodating for my mother with a cane, although there for Father's Day. The food was excellent, the people were very friendly and made two generations of dads happy with breakfast. Definitely going back and think mom and dad will as well. Thanks to our server Samantha. Keep smiling."}
{"text":"Went to the new Tempe location after receiving a giftcard in the mail.  It had a great atmosphere and I loved the dog-friendly patio.  The downside was the food. The food was prepared tasteful 'looking' food, but the food sucked! The chef was an amateur unable to make simple meals.  Very disappointing. Don't claim to be a brunch place if you can't make good food."}
{"text":"I don't think the food was bad, but it was very pricey for the simple environment and the simplicity of the food.  The food was good, but I won't pay that much for an average meal again.  I felt I was gouged due to the spring training time of the year.  We did find better food at better restaurants in the area.   Again, the food was fine, just seemed over priced."}
{"text":"I like coming here on the occasional early morning.  The food is pretty good and the prices are about what I would expect.  Service is good too.  Nothing terribly stand-out, but no complaints, either."}
{"text":"Great place to go for breakfast and they have patio seating.  I went on a Wednesday morning and was seated right away.  Food and service was great.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Such a fantastic interior! So bright and inviting! Love it! But, make sure to ask for your sausage or bacon extra cooked, it arrived very, VERY under done. Oh, and the iced coffee blends are Delish!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast. Great vibe. On the loud side and dog friendly doesn't mean the dogs are friendly so beware sitting on patio. Service gets a big sparse when it's busy. Otherwise a do again when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I thought this place was excellent. They have a HUGE menu with breakfast and lunch items. I tried the southwest omelette and nut and oat waffle. Both were awesome. Some reviews say the wait for food was terrible but this is their 3rd day! Staff was all super nice ..."}
{"text":"I am totally a breakfast person but I probably will not return to this place.  I ordered the squeeze scramble - eggs were Luke warm, potatoes and toast were cold. My hubby ordered the Waldorf salad, he said it was just okay. Service was average. We eat out all the time and I really wanted to love Morning Squeeze but unfortunately it just didn't happen."}
{"text":"We love this place. It took some time to work the kinds out but now it is our favorite breakfast place in old town. My favorite menu item are the breakfast tacos!"}
{"text":"I've been to Morning Squeeze a handful of times and they have all been pleasant outings. Unfortunately this last on has me wanting to not come back again. Understandably, it was a busy Saturday so waiting to get sat was not an issue. It's after we were sat that wasn't that great. We ordered our food within 15 minutes of getting sat but didn't receive our food for an entire hour. We were seconds away from putting cash on the table for the drinks and just leaving. Our server did not come over once to reassure us that the food was even being made or on its way. I had to stop her in passing and ask what the hold up was an hour later. When the food did arrive it was cold and half of my husband's meal was still missing. Very disappointed in the productivity.  And lastly, Morning Squeeze must be in dire need to save money because they traded out basic glass plates to plastic flimsy plates that look like something of a middle school cafeteria.. not quality at all.. and they traded out their nice big white mugs for itty bitty Ikea mugs.. like why? Save your money and walk across the street to the Breakfast Club where its better to wait the extra 15 Min and get good quality everything."}
{"text":"Hey, i really dig this place.  Heard about their great breakfast but couldn't pass up a BLT for lunch.  My office is just down the street and now I'm hooked.  Going to be a great weekend breakfast joint and TVs for football too.  Leslie the GM really seemed to be on top of things.  The staff was smiling, attentive and the BLT was loaded with the good stuff."}
{"text":"The food is ok... I used to go for the old wait staff and the 99 cent mimosas. Now that they seem to have an all new staff and no more 99 cent mimosas I won't be back. Twice now I have been for the Nutella creep and been brought pancakes. Not nearly the same thing. I am to nice to send them back, but I won't be back either."}
{"text":"I had high hopes when my mimosa came and it was delicious, but with a long wait for food I became a little weary. Our food came cold, eggs Benedict were hard boiled, lox canes well done. Asked for poached eggs, waited awhile for the new eggs which then came out a mess in a bowl, broken told hard on one..disgusting. I hate being a complainer, but I think at point get a new cook. Not asking for a whole lot just poached eggs. My husbands omelet came out cold, up side it had a lot of bacon in it. Would never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"When planning my trip to Scottsdale I bookmarked several places that looked interesting. This was one that I was glad I did.   A very nice indoor/outdoor restaurant that even has a pet friendly area located in Old Town Scottsdale.   We of course started off with coffee. I then ordered the Mexican Breakfast Burrito which has scrambled eggs, hash browns, black beans, chorizo with melted cheese & salsa. I was given a choice of red or green sauce I choose the red. The wife ordered the Halls Oats N nuts waffle which is also served with their homemade granola, pecans, walnuts and powdered sugar. She also had a side of sausage links.   The service was quick and everyone was very friendly. It definitely seems like a popular place even on a semi chilly morning like today."}
{"text":"I always bring visiting friends to this place for brunch...  I've never heard anything but positive comments.  I too love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm not really the \"Yelper\" type, but I just wanted to say that I love Morning Squeeze! The food is always yummy and you can always plan to be in an upbeat and fun environment! Also, Gino is amazing and makes sure customers are happy. This is a great spot in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Such a good vibe here, staff is fun, food is great, location is amazing. Sit outside and see the view of Camelback and all the $100,000 cars drive by on Scottsdale Rd on a Sat or Sun morning. It gets busy but the servers do a good job hustling and service with a smile even when rushed. Laura the bartender will make a great Bloody Mary, make you feel like you are getting personalized service, as she serves the entire bar of 25 people. My favorite breakfast place"}
{"text":"I have to admit that this was the worst breakfast I have had in Scottsdale. I had been once before and it was pretty good.  Not today. Room temperature OJ out of a carton.... yuck.  Cold coffee... double yuck.  I never knew that Eggs Benedict was served with rock solid hard-boiled eggs until today.... triple yuck.  Save your money and go to Denny's.  The food was that bad here.  My friend's breakfast was just as bad.  The wait staff did their best but you can't cover awful."}
{"text":"Was there today for brunch. I ordered a vanilla latte and their florentine omelet. My friend ordered their oats and nuts pancakes. The service wasn't great, but the food was really good. I rated it a 4 star because I didn't like how long things took to get to our table and I didn't like how they up-charge for anything and everything you change. Besides that, the decor is fun and cheerful. The coffee is wonderful and the breakfast was great."}
{"text":"Came on a busy Sunday with 5 people. We were seated pretty quickly and had great service. Even though it was very busy the noise level wasn't bad and easy to have a conversation without having to feel like I was yelling. I always love the hibiscus orange juice and Southwestern omelet"}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about.  Brianna was nice and kept out of my way.  Forgot a coffee refill when my friend said, \"A little more, please\", but clearly when we asked a second time, Brianna didn't hear the first request.  No foul.  Food for my friend was excellent.  I skipped, not hungry.  I'd visit again. Definitely within an hour of opening.  Mid-day, probably not."}
{"text":"Newly opened: I've been waiting for this place to open for a while now and was excited to see their doors open this morning. The decor is bright and cheery with great bar area and big pillowy booths. A+ for breakfast ambience.  Ask for Paige. She was knowledgable, very friendly, and gave great service. The coffee was delicious and I'm a coffee critic. They were passing out free samples of their spin on The Breakfast Buzz, an espresso protein drink, and it was also great. Food came out fast and everyone was happy. Order the fresh-baked biscuits as an appetizer--they were amazing.   All around a worthy addition to the Scottsdale breakfast scene."}
{"text":"Large breakfast & lunch menu but no corned beef hash :(. Good atmosphere and food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the crowds and very cute decor. The food was disappointing at best. My husband had a breakfast burrito of some kind that was blah, really disappointing, and portions are smallish. My whole wheat pancakes with pecans and bananas tasted like you would think raw YEAST tastes.  Really bad!! And I let them know because no one should have to eat pancakes that taste terrible.  If you're a breakfast place and can't come up with a recipe for whole wheat pancakes that taste decent, then DON'T put it on the menu and don't serve it.  I could understand a whole wheat pancake being a little grainy and maybe a little thick, but it certainly does not have to taste sour! Don't bother going. You'll be much better off at Orange Table near the Scottsdale Performing Arts Center, Daily Dose, or plenty of the other restaurants in Old Town that serve brunch."}
{"text":"They have great cocktails and usually have seats available at the bar. It's not worth waiting for a table, and the service is crazy slow. We waited almost an hour for granola and an egg sandwich. But if you are in the mood to drink and don't mind waiting for your food, this place is as good as any."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite breakfast spot In town. Dequan was an amazing server! If you can a change to stop by, ask for Dequan!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and wasn't impressed with really anything. The food is average, nothing impressive or that you couldn't make yourself. They have a $20 champagne bottle that was split between five girls, which wasn't enough, so we ordered another. Overall a small and nicely decorated spot for average food."}
{"text":"The eggs benedict was okay but they need to work on their hollandaise sauce. It was really Bland.  It's a great location right on Scottsdale Road and it's nice to sit up by the street and watch all the passers-by. :-)"}
{"text":"Had a great brunch here...cali eggs bene and crispy bacon was great, we also had a mimosa flight (which had classic, pomegranate, and hibiscus varieties) for 9 bux. Prices are a little high and you have to ask for things (like refills, ketchup, cream for coffee, etc) but overall the ambience was great- the breeze flows through the entire restaurant and we just chilled and relaxed for a while. I would definitely go back during spring/fall cool season."}
{"text":"We were never actually acknowledged after being sat. Pitty, menu looked tasty. We walked over to the Original Chop Shop across the street."}
{"text":"Grandsons love the\"do it yourself\" breakfast sandwich and the coffee is great.  I'm from Seattle and I know my coffee.  Service included asking if I wanted a to go cup for my coffee, which was actually a large fresh poured cup."}
{"text":"Was excited to see a morning squeeze here. I was actually on my way to snooze and was told to try this location.We were a table at five and we all thought the good was just ok. I didn't like that the flax seeds were just thrown in the pancake.The coffee was really good though! I'll def come back to try other stuff hoping that something will taste better."}
{"text":"The service was really good. We ordered an omelet and protein pancakes. Loved the pancakes!!! The only complain was the potatoes that came with the omelet were hard and old. We let the waitress know and she fixed it by bringing out some fresh potatoes."}
{"text":"Great fun decor. Menu looks great and creative. Food quality is pretty disappointing.  They offer fresh squeezed orange juice and it was absolutely not even close to real juice, even the waitress admit it that it was freshly squeezed 'locally' delivered every two days! To me it looked and tasted like tropicana or made from concentrate.  Over medium eggs were really runny that had a lot of clear, runny runny, raw !  They recommended some crispy french toast that were topped with corn flakes to add crunch and yes  they were pretty crispy, they were deep fried like 'churros'!  Service is ordinary."}
{"text":"Nice menus, very friendly staff over everything is dog friendly place. Extremely clean and nice decorations."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and probably won't return.  Coffee was good as well as the side of sausage links that I had. The pancakes were huge!  But as for my actual breakfast of lemon ricotta poppy seed pancakes......no. Their were so many poppy seeds in the pancakes it was ridiculous. The ricotta was supposed to have lemon in it but that was lackluster and gritty, not smooth consistency. The lemon chutney was sloppily placed on 3 corners of the 4 sided plate. Presentation was clearly not cared for. And the chutney needed to be cut up/graded better during prep. I had to do additional cutting before being able to eat it.  I guess when it says lemon ricotta pancakes, I was expecting to not get a lump of it plopped on top of my pancakes and left for me to put the final plating together. You know, like I work there or something."}
{"text":"Just left the Morning Squeeze in Old Town Scottsdale and felt having breakfast here which is a rarity for me. I'd rate it middle of the road one step about Denny's.   Had French Toast which was mediocre alone with a side of bacon which was really thin. Come on Mr Restaurant owner you know people love the swine, so stop trying to save and give up the meaty crispy bacon we deserve.   On a positive note they have girls in skimpy outfits serving your needs. So I had that going for me and last but not least the OJ is fresh squeezed and yummy. Grab a glass and an outdoor sidewalk seating and enjoy something but don't have huge expectations about what your getting."}
{"text":"All of the smoothies were terrific.  Fries were great. Sitting outside was great.  The eggs Bennett was ok.  Needs better sauce or more. My salad was just ok."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I ordered a acai bowl and asked if I could add shredded coconut to it. However when my bowl came out there was only shredded coconut on it and pumpkin seeds which weren't supposed to be on it. There was no fruit like the description had said, plus it was 11.50 for not that big of a portion. I did not pay 12 dollars for a smoothie bowl that didn't contain goji berries, bananas, strawberries and blueberries. Outrageous prices for food that is mediocre. Will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"We LOVE going to morning squeeze when we vacation in Scottsdale. The food is great and the service is awesome! Our server, Briana, is SO great and keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying one star is being generous. Maybe it was because it was a slow Tuesday, but all of the staff minus the bartender and hostess looked miserable and stressed, including our own server, who did not take the time to introduce herself and quickly left without any waters or anything.   Now, I am usually very understanding of restaurant  hardships as I myself work in a breakfast joint. But MS was pretty dead and only a couple of other people around, and our food took 31 minutes for a mere cremebrulee pancakes and a breakfast sandwich.   The food itself was ATROCIOUS. We got two burnt pancakes that looked slapped down on the plate in a hurry, a surprise given how long it took to get. My sandwich was just an egg and some avocado between a croissant, that honestly tastes like I could have made it myself in less time and with a better attitude. Given the smaller portions and less than mediocre food, the time took was ridiculous and better spent at a Juliobertos.   Our server than just left the check folded without saying anything and we never got a good bye or anything else. We were pretty glad to leave and I've never wanted to get out of a place faster! I don't know what it is about the decor, the service, or the food but this place is missing a lot of its potential.   The time it took to get us our food could be better used to train all the members of the establishment to cook better, serve better and be better in general."}
{"text":"I've been here before and decided to try it again, but not much better.  I ordered a grilled cheese and there was literally 2 pieces of cold cheese on it.  Crappy grilled cheese and iced tea for $13 isn't bad, if the grilled cheese is oozing hot cheese.  But this sandwich looked like something out of a junior high cafeteria.  I won't be returning to this restaurant based on the crappy quality of food."}
{"text":"I'm not one to leave negative comments but I've had it with this place. I've ordered from here for over a year now. Food is never the same, it's over priced and the place just needs new management. Half the time you get bad attitudes, bad service and a gambled meal."}
{"text":"This place has a great location, cute decoration and a very original and tAsty menu. Great unique coffees, drinks and food. There is a wait but it's well worth it.  Love the outdoor seating and the mugs on the wall."}
{"text":"What a great place! Super nice staff, fast service, great food. Everything looked delicious. We shared pulled pork eggs Benedict and a waffle. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a friend's suggestion.  Place was packed, so there was a bit of a wait, and it seemed like there were empty tables while we were waiting. We got our seats and had to wait a bit for service, but all went well after that.  Food was good and the staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"Great place for awesome omelets and breakfast pancakes. Great sangria also. Service was spot on even though they were very busy on July 4th."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary was good and the coffee too, which I am a stickler about.  Coffee has to have flavor and not be Foldgers-esque.   Veggie omelette was so full of veggies it was a bit watery.  Added a dash of seasoning to everything and the flavors popped.    Something must have caught on fire in the kitchen because mid-way through the meal I thought we might have to evacuate due to the burning smell.  Do not let that deter you though, people we're nice, server was great, and for worth a try.  Yum on!"}
{"text":"The best thing to come out of our visit to this place was the discovery of the french restaurant next door. Morning Squeeze could have been great had it not been for their hungover, unwashed, uppity clientele.   My husband and I and our infant decided to have breakfast one Sunday morning, It was nice out so we ate on the patio. Their patio is dog-friendly, as are we, even though we left our furry friends at home.  Enter the most annoying man alive. This guy in his late 30s was dining with what might have been a date (probably his last) and his long haired dachshund. He proceeded to talk to every person on the patio except his date. Whether you wanted to or not, this guy was going to talk to you. All about him and his stupid little dog. Then he went on and on about how he knows the manager. Is it Brian? Because that's the name he kept dropping. Like anyone cares that you know the restaurant manager. Seriously. STOP ANNOYING PEOPLE!!!  So the fun happened when two guys and their pitbull mix and sharpei mix sat on the patio. Let me say these dogs were really well behaved. They laid down next to their owners and slept. UNTIL this chatty idiot with the dachshund decided to let his dog off leash. You know the phrase \"Let sleeping dogs lie?\" Apparently this guy hasn't. He let his doxie run right up to these two sleeping dogs that were like 100 times its size. Needless to say a dog fight ensued just  feet away from our infant.   Dear Morning Squeeze: You need to require that four legged visitors be kept on a leash at all times and supervised by their owner.  I had no idea I was putting my child in danger by ordering eggs benedict and coffee on a Sunday morning.  I won't be back. I'll be at the quiet Au Petite Four next door enjoying gigantic crepes."}
{"text":"I finally decided to step in for a quick breakfast sandwich. Wishful thinking I suppose, service was prompt upon arrival but it faded quickly. I waited 6 minutes for my mimosa, we'll I should say orange juice. Had to ask for the champagne to be added.   I didn't know what to expect of the food, I went with the jet setter, asked for avocado and an over medium egg. It arrived and I honestly was disappointed. The portion size was legit but to use a full sized pretzel bun for a breakfast sandwich is a little much. We already are getting a carb only option as a side. Top of bun=removed. One could def. Enjoy the pretzel bun if about an inch was cut out of the middle. No avocado  and an over easy/runny egg but didn't want to wait. Mental errors will kill the experience for those who know steps of service. All in all, it was what I had expected I probably won't be back"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in Old Town. I've been here half a dozen times and I've had mixed results with the food. However the cold brew coffee is incredible. It's even better than the coffee shops in the area and it's the reason why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"We had a great visit on Mar 6. Visiting for the SF Giants Spring Training, we felt welcomed immediately from the host and staff and of course the orange and black was prevalent. Super cool open vibe both inside and outside which is blended by the open wall configuration. Service was good, although the food was a slight hick-up. We were a bit surprised at the portion size (i.e. a bit weak in overall offering there). We thanked the server and kitchen staff as we were seated in a booth facing the open kitchen."}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews for this place aren't better.  I had a typical breakfast plate and my boyfriend got the breakfast burrito. Both were really good !"}
{"text":"Fun hot spot for breakfast/brunch. The whole place is open to the outside so it has a great Phoenix feel. Clientele is eclectic and varied. Food is tasty with intriguing options. I had the pulled pork Benedict. It was tasty. The the poached eggs were way over cooked and the potatoes were also over done. Bloody Mary was good but not memorable. French press coffee was a nice touch.   I'd definitely go back, but will either manage the expectations or asks them to fix whatever isn't quite right."}
{"text":"Eggs and bacon are really good, not life changing, but good. The 5 stars are for what replaced the toast and potatoes I didn't want. Not just fruit, but berries. I know it sounds stupid, but most places will not do it. I hear no substitutions, $2-4 up charge , or at best a pathetic little bowl of fruit.  What I heard from Morning Squeeze - sure. And it's a really nice bowl of rasp, straw an blue.  Service has been a bit slower than it should be.  I know it going in, doesn't bother me."}
{"text":"The Owners sister walked right in, picked her table and bypassed the six people waiting for an available table. Rude!!!"}
{"text":"A lot of money was invested in this Scottsdale road restaurant which specializes in breakfast, rather than potentiousness and getting people drunk for maximum profit. As such it fills a void in the market  I thought I was in for an expensive meal when I saw a Maybach and a Vette parked out front, but we're talking Denny's level prices for a meal with good portions, at a place that doesn't skimp on paying serious rent or multiple waitress' wages  I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of the Greek omelet in which I substituted egg whites. The feta and the grilled tomatoes were to die for, and the omelet was the perfect level of fluffiness without being soggy  Hash browns were too oily, but I could live with that  Overall a solid 8.5 out of ten on the food, and perfect ten for patio seating and ambiance. All for a reasonable price"}
{"text":"I'm hemming an hawing between 2 and 3 stars ... The food is A-Ok.  The service could use some polishing!  I wish I could remember who served me this past Saturday, but she was seriously lacking with being prompt and attentive.  Took a few minutes before she hit our table after seating, and she apologized.  Then again when our food finally got to us via a food runner (again she apologized for the long wait...it was probably 20-25 mins), she didn't come back and check on us until we were ready for to-go boxes.  Such a shame because my avocado didn't come out with my breakfast burrito, and I really would have liked more of the green salsa (don't bother with the red... too much smoky chipotle and the flavor balance is off).  I also never got a refill on my water.  My friend and I were at a two top on the patio, and after the breakfast rush around 1130am... Why the lack of attention?? I will say the classic bloody mary was on point. Its what saved this from being a 2-star review.  Perfectly spicy and not at all bitter.  This is probably the only spot in town that doesn't run any drink specials for mimosas or bloodies on wknds.  Morning Squeeze has a large menu, and offers vegan/vegetarian options, which I appreciate.  They have a protein shake called The Jolt that I've had in the past with almond milk and highly recommend if you're looking for a morning boost!   Not sure I'll put this in regular or serious rotation for brunch/breakfast... It could be much better and much more appealing with a few tweaks and some better service training."}
{"text":"Restaurant is very nicely decorated with a vintage feel. However, the service was terrible. We waited 45min to get our food while others around us had no wait at all. The mimosas tasted like a sour punishment on the palate.  When the food arrived: Hashbrows were cold  Omelet was burnt  Sandwich was wrong  Bagel was stale  Avocado was too hard to eat.   And to top it all off, our waitress made it her mission to play hide and seek."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and the breakfast bar scales both the inside and outside of the establishment. Food is consistent and they use both fresh and quality ingredients. A very cool and retro spot located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale.  For those who partied too much at all of the local bars in this entertainment district, grab a Bloody Mary's or Mimosa and embrace the \"Hair of the Dog\". #vino2ultimate #vinosquared"}
{"text":"There is a reason this restaurant has a line out the door on the weekends. It's because they have a good breakfast, a decent patio and they are dog friendly! We've eaten breakfast here a couple of times and have been lucky both times to not have to wait for a table. We came one time with our dog Harley and he had a blast! In fact, they have a special menu for dogs. Yes, dogs! We ordered Harley the Pup cakes for dogs which are pancakes and gravy. Harley gobbled it up in about three bites! I enjoyed the omelet which was also tasty but I think Harley enjoyed his meal more. All in all, this is a great breakfast nook and one you should visit!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable! And perfect for meeting friends for breakfast (which I do often). The food smelled and tasted delicious. The server had no trouble exchanging my coffee for a latte, which is a nice change in Old Town. The restaurant has a fresh, comfy feel and everyone is friendly right when you walk in the door. I will be going back for sure to try more on the menu and sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty cool. they have a pretty large selection of food so that's nice. prices are decent for a breakfast/brunch/lunch. unfortunately the service here today wasn't as great as I was expecting. I don't have high expectations but if I am standing at the bar trying to order a drink for ten minutes and can't even get acknowledged once, and a man walks up and she greets him promptly, there's a problem. Thankfully our server took good care of us and after waiting 40 minutes for our food she took $10 off the bill. The ticket says Alexandra, but she goes by \"Ally\", so if you come in request her because she was really nice and knowledgeable about the restaurant. she remained cool, calm, and collected while we waited. she explained they had to let go a few kitchen staff members and that's why there was a wait. On the other hand, the red head at the bar was the one who ignored me while trying to order, so stay away from her. Their food was great, no complaints really. their iced latte was good after our server finally got it for me."}
{"text":"This place is not good at all. The food was bland and not flavorful. The cheese they used was like generic shredded cheese from food city. It was overpriced for what you got. Very disappointed. Will not be coming back. Gross."}
{"text":"I am really surprised to see that this place doesn't have a five star average! I just visited for my second time today, and I was just as pleased as the first trip!  The food is fantastic, and I love that they used local and organic ingredients! They also offer gluten free options, which is great! I have really loved both meals I've had, and the service has been fantastic!  The first visit was with my dog, Arya, and I loved that she was allowed on the patio. They also have heaters all along their outdoor patio, so my pup and I can visit in the winter too! They even have a menu for dogs, and Arya gulped down her chicken and eggs! Three people from the staff promptly came out to say hello to my pup too, which just makes you feel even more welcome!   I couldn't say enough great things, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop in here for breakfast recently since we hadn't been in a while. We had about a 15/20 minute wait (which was totally fine) and we had about an hour before we needed to leave for an appointment at 11am. Well, we got seated and placed our order right away. I had the Lox and bagel and my boyfriend had a fruit/yogurt bowl. We waited and waited and waited and waited...all while noticing people who arrived MUCH later than we did were getting their food in about 10/12 minutes...we were going on 30 minutes and barely seeing or server and at this point I was getting nervous we were going to be late for our appointment. We saw her about 20 minutes into our wait and we ordered a hazelnut latte and we got that in a few minutes and still we waited and waited for our food. Once our food finally arrived 40 minutes after we ordred it we had 10 minutes to eat it, pay and head out to our appointment. While the food was good I was very disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"Service was lacking, food was microwaved, and the employees are too good to he here. Starting with this host just stared at us as we walked in because she must have been too busy standing trying to look hot. Then we get our server, who checked on us twice during the whole time. The runner from the kitchen had to end up taking my order for a drink because Katie R was too busy talking up the hostess. During this time I saw the other waitress check on her table 3 times. Country fried steak was disgusting and dry, English muffin was cold. I have been here several times but this is the last, unfortunately. Management had failed to see any Yelps as I can tell. The internet is the forefront of your business, check local sources and maybe you wouldn't keep running into these same issues."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast joint in town. Always great good, good service, and perfect location."}
{"text":"Our experience at this restaurant was awful. My ham and cheese omelet was good, but that was the end of the positive experience. The grilled cheese sandwiches sounded great on the menu, but were disgusting - dried out bread, unmelted cheese. The bathrooms are dark and creepy. The service - from seating, to being served, to getting the check - was extremely slow. (We ate here in the middle of the week, around 2pm) Worst of all was our waitress. She was rude and slow to respond. The icing on the cake was as we were packing up our belongings, the waitress came by and counted the tip we had left. Needless to say, we will never be returning."}
{"text":"Just an okay place!  The atmosphere was lively!  The food was priced accordingly,  reasonable for the food. I was hoping for something outstanding,  but I hot ordinary! !!"}
{"text":"Extremely underseasoned and nothing is made with their own recipes. Extremely overpriced for what you get. Super loud ambiance. Slow service. Wouldn't come back and I live less than 200 feet away. Lol."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but was shocked at the lack of service. My colleges and I, about 7 of us, waited over 75 minutes for our order without even a word or apology from the manager. When we arrived, there were only a few people in the place so I can't even justify it being busy. When we finally asked to put our order in bags so we could get to the office on time,  our server even apologized that her manager wouldn't acknowledge us or their shortcomings. As a business owner, reviews are not a thing to take lightly and I know how devastating a bad review can be. I therefore write this in hopes that the folks at Morning Squeeze take this as a lesson learned and make some changes. I don't want a discount and I don't want free food. Simply, and acknowledgment of a mistake and give me a reason to try you again in the future."}
{"text":"Started the New Year off right! Creme brulee pancakes. Soft and fluffy on the inside, a ridiculously tasty sugary crispy brulee crust on the outside. You don't even need syrup.   Coffee is great. Service was a bit slow, but it was packed this morning. Another great visit."}
{"text":"Great food, pleasant service. My meal was prepared exactly as ordered. I liked the local sourcing of ingredients. The coffee was fantastic!  I highly recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"The only thing fast about our visit was the pick up of the check.  Getting seated was slow, the service was slow, the food was on par with Denny's.  I would say only come here if you are looking to impress friends with dogs, otherwise, save your money and go to Scramble down the road."}
{"text":"It was the perfect Sunday for Brunch. Location is great, the server Briana is really nice but food and overall attention was far from satisfying. Food took like 20ish minute to arrive, my Crossfit scramble came with a hair on it so I had to wait more time to get the replacement. Just one apology but no drink on the house or anything to compensate. Then the lady that clean the glass door sprayed us with Windex by accident. WTF!? All those chemicals went into our drinks, and again, just one simple sorry that didn't fix anything. I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Look, I want to like this place. It's close to home, it's hip, has a decent menu..... but none of that makes up for the fact that I have never had good service here, my food has often times come out cold and is mediocre at best. My roommates and I were coming here on a pretty regular basis, but after our experience today with a server (if you could call her that) named Alexis, we will never come back. I'm in the industry and this chick shouldn't even have a job, I've never had worse \"service\" in my life. The manager, Leslie, attempted to make up for it, and she was very nice but the way Alexis acted left such a sour taste in my mouth, and the food isn't good enough to make me come back. After she got spoken to by her manager, and we were leaving, she had the nerve to run out to the patio as we were walking out the door to \"thank us\" in the most petty way. We all tipped her, and honestly more than we should have, so there was no reason for her to act so inappropriately. If she focused on her tables as much as she did on being a b word, she'd probably be a little more successful at her job."}
{"text":"Heard good things about it and believed them until I found hair underneath my piece of French toast AND in the coffee creamer container. Complete lose of appetite. Not to mention the English muffin was clearly toasted and served cold. Food came out with no silverware and was cold by the time I could eat it."}
{"text":"Came here two times for breakfast on a 3 day trip to Scottsdale because it was that good. The first time, I had the hangover bowl which was delicious and my husband had the breakfast tacos which he said were really good. The second time we both had breakfast burritos and split an açaí bowl which were all great. Both visits had great service! Highly recommend visiting Morning Squeeze when you're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place has horrible service, the waiter couldn't retain the order had to have my meal made 3 times before it was made right. waited over a hour to eat, my orange juice was warm and when asked what kind of oranges are used the waiter replied and said Navel oranges but he wasn't sure how it taste. Due to having my order made over, the staffed treated my sister and I as if we did something wrong and gave us dirty looks the entire time. when asked to speak with a manager a young lady came to the table saying she was manager and that she apologize for the service. she said our breakfast would be on the house. shortly after someone else came to our table asked what we ordered so we explained again. one food was brought it still wasn't what we had ordered but decided a hour was long enough to wait so we keep our meal. When leaving the same waiter that fucked up our original order had the audacity to run outside with this receipt in his hand demanding us to pay, we kindly asked for the manager, a young lady came out who advised she was the manager, we told her she was not the same person we spoke to at the table who had said she was the manager and that our food was on the house. She apologized and after hearing what had took place she agreed it should be on the house. My issue with this entire situation is, it was Mother's day, I only came to this place because it was advertised on FB and IG, and the food looked great. but after going through all of that, I don't think I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Stayed in Old Towne and decided to check the place out. Staff not friendly, food was sub par. Biscuits and gray had very little gravy.  Wifey got a bowl and it was partially warm.  Not a good experience."}
{"text":"YES!  WAAAAY better and actually this place itself was better than it is now.  What happened?  Love the area-get to walk from our home into town and the view is Camelback mountain.  SO much going for this place and something is missing.  A breakfast place in town should be welcoming and homey so that even out of towners or snowbirds want to go back for more.  We get repeat visitors in Scottsdale so we need to develop joints that last for decades just like cities as New York, Chicago, LA...I have certain restaurants I go back to every time I visit even the smallest of towns... worst thing that happened that may be a cause is lack of accountability of what is expected from the employees.  A manager needs to get their employees to feel where they work is awesome and appreciate them then maybe they would worry about doing things that could cause them to leave their awesome job...for instance...we literally walk away from our table after eating and realize my husband left his very expensive NIKE sun glasses on the table so we walk back and they are gone...the bartender even noticed to tell him that he just saw him with them on his head.  My husband never went to bathroom neither.  My husband immediately asked the busboy and he said no.  Low and behold after looking everywhere and asking everyone I asked my waitress to please ask the kitchen again and how interesting the busboy had them.  It was to obvious and too weird.  Are you kidding me?  Is it worth losing a job let alone your integrity?  I mentioned this to the manager and her excuse was lame...ok...well, now you know why a business may lose its strength and it starts with PAPA BEAR and frankly this restaurant is missing a gut.  A good soul with some depth can survive, but the rest of them will eventually fade out.  I wish this restaurant much luck and hope it finds its way back.  I would start with good help.  Honest help that takes pride in working and is afraid to lose their job."}
{"text":"I love the Scottsdale location and wanted to try the Tempe one, however they are far from the same. We waited an hour for our food from the time we ordered, two of us got eggs Benedict and another got a toasted bagel. There is no way this takes an hour to make when only 25 people were in the place (I counted on the way out). The potatoes are overly salted, I like sea salt, but they were so salted that I couldn't eat them. There was puke in the bathroom, someone had clearly missed the toilet and had been there long enough to dry. Lastly our waitress never refilled our waters so I kept needing to remind her, she didn't bring ketchup and hot sauce after we asked twice, and she didn't bring out a crepe that we ordered. The crepe wasn't on our tab so it wasn't a big deal, but again, with only 25 people in there at 11 am, I don't understand why it is so difficult to get good service and an order correct. Do yourself a favor a walk over to Snooze a few blocks down."}
{"text":"Meh-so many other places for brunch out there, we won't be back. Slow service, and pretty expensive for what you get. Had the creme brûlée pancakes which were just ok. Tiny sides of syrup and by the time the server came back I was almost done with my meal. Skip this one."}
{"text":"We wanted this to be a good spot, because you can bring your \"spot\" on the patio. Service was slow and not so great, and it wasn't real busy. I had the Hall n Oats waffle and it wasn't awesome. The Mr. ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and it was less than awesome. We thought the food tasted like frozen food. Hash browns were not good, and they only served one piece of toast with the CFS, which isn't a deal breaker, but it wasn't a good tasting piece of toast. I want to give it another shot, but Mr. S says no. Bumskis, morning squeeze!"}
{"text":"Briana was a wonderful server! Awesome mimosa flight, pomegranate was our favorite and fantastic brunch! Amazing breakfast sandwiches!! Would definitely recommend the breakfast sandwiches!!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and Excellent service I will definitely be back again. I really like they are dog friendly,next time I will bring my boxer."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!! Pretty pricey for breakfast and not AT ALL worth the $$$. Our food took FOREVER to come out and not sure why because we could see our eggs sitting on the counter for at least 10 min, then of course they came cold! The English muffin was still frozen in the center. They forgot the sides. They also got the order wrong for another dish.  The only positive thing to say is that the server was very nice. Although she should have comped at least one of the orders."}
{"text":"I won't give up on this place......yet.  I really like going here because of the location, atmosphere and generally the staff but my most recent visit was disappointing.    It started with the hostess.  There were no people waiting in line or lingering around waiting for a table.  In fact, there were 2 empty tables.  When I requested a table for two, preferably outside on the west side of the bar area the hosted took my name and that was it.  10 minutes and still 2 empty tables later we still hadn't been seated.  Was there a waiting list?  I don't know since I was never told there would be a wait for a table.  In my 11+ years of working in restaurants I've never heard of NOT informing a patron that there is a wait to be seated.  With 4 empty seats at the bar my companion and I opted to sit there.  Both bartenders working the bar were very friendly and always kept our coffee and waters filled.  The food was okay.  I had the corned beef hash and I wasn't impressed, nor will I  every order it again.  The toast.  What is it with Morning Squeeze and their constant ability to screw up the toast?  Last time I ate here the toast was burnt, hard and cold.  You could also smell toast burning.  This time I ate here it was an exact, and I mean EXACT repeat.  Burnt, hard and cold toast on my plate and twice during our time there you could smell burning or burnt toast.  Obviously their system for making toast needs some serious improvement.  My companion had the Release Grayson and it was good.  As the place became busier and busier I watched numerous waitresses and one of the bartenders get clean glassware off the hanging racks by sticking their fingers INSIDE the glasses.  That is a major NO-NO!  You do not, I repeat do NOT put your fingers inside glassware or carry them from the top of the rim.  That is \"Restaurant 101\".  No, I am not being picky or a \"germophobe\" you just don't do that.  Think of 10 possible places those fingers could have been 30 seconds prior to being inside that clean glass.  Counting money?  Wiping their face?  Cleaning a table?  You get my drift.  I am hopeful my next visit is better and I will definitely specify to the server how I won't my toast prepared!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Every time I stay in Scottsdale I eat breakfast here. Definitely recommend the Belfer Bowl."}
{"text":"It gets a five star for atmosphere, food and service!!!! Cami was our server and she was outstanding!!!! She showed up at our table with a big smile and a cheery \"hello\". We told her it was our first visit to Morning Squeeze and she eagerly gave us recommendations without even having to ask. Food was served very quickly (again with a genuine cheery attitude) it was hot and delicious!!! Smoked pulled pork eggs Benedict and breakfast tacos were spot on and more than we could eat. We will be back on our next visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"So I love the food here but the service is absolutely terrible. Both times I've been here, the servers have been rude and disengaged. However, they were blatantly flirty with the male customers. I waited 45 minutes for eggs, bacon, and potatoes and it finally came out when I asked about it. When I had asked for utensils to go since I had to run after waiting so long, the server snuck them onto the other side of my table so that I didn't see them, causing me to wait around even longer until I told her I would just grab some myself. She then rudely pointed out that she put them next to me.   Hire new staff and I would love to come back with friends and family (who all agree that there is terrible service at Morning Squeeze). Otherwise, not worth the negative vibes and sloooow service."}
{"text":"I liked their food and service the last couple of times. It's a good place with good food. Especially during the spring time and sitting out on patio drinking a mimosa is refreshing.  Had them checked the balance on my gift card but wouldn't take it. They said they don't accept it anymore. How weird since it should have $10 on it. Beware if you have gift cards or anything like that to this place."}
{"text":"Best place to grab breakfast in Scottsdale, hands down.  Love the indoor-outdoor Palm Springs in the 60's vibe.  Food is stellar (and the menu is the same in their Tempe location if you are closer to Mill and 7th).   Must tries:  the protein pancakes, the crepes, the Laguna Beach-inspired Acai bowl, and the breakfast tacos.  Wait staff is trained well and they actually seem to enjoy being there.  Not sure what beans they use but the coffee is great too."}
{"text":"After visiting the farmer's market in Old Town this morning, we decided to stop for breakfast. I'm kinda on the fence about this place. Here's why....  Pros:  Waitress and hostess were both AMAZING. My husband and I have both been in customer service for awhile and tend to kinda people watch. The staff was consistently great with every table.  Mimosa was good for the price. $6. My husband had fresh squeezed OJ. So amazing!!!  Husband had the veggie omelette. Over cooked, but decent. He opted for all fruit, no potato, and the fruit consisted of watermelon, melon, and pineapple. Also not bad.  French toast was yummy!!!!! I added bacon and strawberries. Bacon was a bit undercooked, but not bad.   Cons: Like I said, I added strawberries to my French toast and for the extra $1.50, I expected more. They looked frozen (even though they're in season) and I think I got a total of 2. Kinda bummed.  The wait for food was pretty long and it didn't seem fresh for the wait, if that makes sense. It seemed like it had been sitting for a bit before it was brought out.   Overall, we might be back. We might check out our other options in Scottsdale next time, but overall it was pretty ok."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict took 40 freakin mins! Unacceptable... You can keep your free drink. The table next to us was saying they've been waiting for an hour. The crab cakes, you can barely taste crab in it, it had more fillers than crab. The sausage and gravy in my husbands plate was not hot. Food is meh... not worth $14"}
{"text":"Came to the Morning Squeeze for breakfast with family and friends.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere at this place.  The service was excellent and very friendly upon arrival.  Had ordered the Southwestern Omlette and really enjoyed the omlette and the OJ.  I thought the decor was awesome at this establishment and felt it was great place to bring friends and family here."}
{"text":"Beware of hair!! I ordered the surf and surf omelet almost two times a week here when they first opened. It was amazing. And then on three different occasions I found a hair in my omelet.  The cooks at the time did not wear hairnets from what I could see. The last time I went in there and ordered it. It had a very fishy smell to it like bad seafood.  My buddy's had the same smell... I sent an email on their website but never got a reply. I would love to start going again if the quality was back to when they first opened...."}
{"text":"Came here for the end of the Yelp Shops Local event in downtown Scottsdale. The decor was super cute and all of the staff were friendly even though I'm sure they were working outside of their normal hours. The menu included kicking spicy bloody mary's, mimosas, and a buffet of your usual breakfast fare- scrambled eggs, bacon, pancakes, eggs benedict, fried potatoes, and the like. I was stoked to get $10 gift cards as part of our goody bag, so we will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"French press coffee tasted like water, with leftover grounds in it. One thing you expect from a breakfast place is good coffee, if not great. The coffee I got, at least, was terrible.  And you would think place called \"Morning Squeeze\" would have fresh squeezed or blended juices; this place does not. Hopefully, they'll make some tweaks and get themselves up a notch or two. The place has a good vibe."}
{"text":"I remember this place as Jimmy Woo's (I'm still a little sad it's gone) but Morning Squeeze was a nice stop end stop for the Yelp Shopping Crawl for Local Businesses. We were served a breakfast buffet and received 2 drink coupons, with a choice of a Mimosa or a Bloody Mary. Same layout as before just different color scheme to Jimmy's, there's 2 bars (one outdoors and one indoors, outdoor patio seating and indoor seating). Kitchen is open and booths surround the restaurant with varying tables. Food and everything was OK, drinks were nice, atmosphere was probably my favorite. I would return if I was in the area and looking for a breakfast/brunch hangout spot in Old Town!"}
{"text":"Just ate there yesterday for a casual business breakfast.  Service was good, food good and appreciated the server allowing me to make adjustment to the menu.  She was sweet.  Also really like the location and atmosphere.   Not to sure about the dog friendly patio, but I guess people like bringing their dogs out.  Not a fan of that or it would have been 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"I tend to be cautious of brunch places in old town. Ive found that they can have long wait times and slow service. I'm pleased however to say that I had a great time at Morning Squeeze! We were given a 20 minute wait time and probably waited only 10. Our server was very attentive and made a point to let us know that they were busy that morning and the kitchen was a little backed up, but if there was anything she could do to make our wait better to let us know. She checked on us a few times while we waited to give us updates on our food.   I ordered the breakfast tacos and omg they were so good. Really simple with just eggs, bacon and jack cheese with sour cream, salsa and pico on the side but good quality food. I want to go back for brunch again this weekend just to have them again!"}
{"text":"Had fabulous breakfast tacos! Service was just fine and the outside seating is comfortable"}
{"text":"We come here every weekend we get a chance to and the food is always amazing. Delays always happen when their busy but I'm never in a hurry to be anywhere else but have breakfast.   Recently here, Briana, is one of the best servers here. Great, friendly, and prompt service. I'll always be back.  Edit: there was nothing wrong with our service. My comment on delays was based on what I saw others reviewed which. We always enjoy the service we receive here."}
{"text":"Food was average. Service was well below average. We sat at the bar had to ask for refills, wipe down of our area, them to pick up the plates when we were done, etc. I have not seen someone so bad at their job in a long time. The food presentation was beyond bad. Food was slapped onto a plate with no presentation in mind. Ordered a omelet with bell peppers and potatoes on the side. When the plate came out, it had bell peppers with egg residue scattered among the potatoes. It would be easier to deal with bad service with decent food, but that was not the case. Mgmt really needs to hire or train better qualified people for this spot...Personally, i will never head back to that joint."}
{"text":"It took awhile to open, but it was worth the wait...  And now I have another great breakfast place in my 'hood to add into the rotation - hooray!  I had a breakfast meeting this morning and suggested we meet at Morning Squeeze since I hadn't been yet.  It was 8:30am on a Thursday am and there was a nice buzz going on when I walked in, but not too crowded. The hostess was welcoming and I like the colorful decor... Shortly after I met my colleague, we were greeted by our servers, who were just attentive enough.  Our drinks were delivered quickly, which I was thankful for too!  I went with their wheat pancakes and a side of egg whites and my friend had the oatmeal brulee.  My eggs were a bit on the salty side, but I dealt with it, and we both enjoyed our breakfast.  The pancake serving size was huge, so I even had leftovers to bring home!    The only awkward feedback was that my \"side of egg whites\" came on two extremely small plates instead of one medium sized one.  They also only had small to-go containers, which wasn't a big deal, but hopefully they'll order some medium sized plates and larger to-go containers in the future.  Other than that, I found prices to be moderate and service spot-on.  Parking wasn't an issue and the location is super convenient to my office and the heart of Old Town, which I love!  I look forward to returning soon.  I hear their lunch menu is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Accidently found Morning Squeeze on the internet trying to buy concert tickets for the group Squeeze! I've be 4 times and they never disappoint. I'm not much of a health nut, so I lean towards the Crème Brulee Pancakes & Bananas Foster Waffle. I know, I'm a child, but my better half eats health and she loves the place too. Their coffee and staff are both a great start to any day!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is great, the food decently tasty and the service okay. I ordered the pitaya bowl. It was...okay. I have had many a pitaya bowl from numerous places and this one wasn't my favorite. There was way too much granola and not enough fruit (although I did read after the fact that you can add extra fruit for an additional charge). There was something in the bowl that tasted a bit stale...not sure if it was the pepitas or the granola or whatnot. The service was okay...I could tell our waitress was stressed (moderately busy) and I had to ask for water more than once (IMO, every guest should receive water and not have to ask for it). Overall, I would return if it was convenient. The decor is cute and the patio is very nice. I love that they are dog friendly and will hopefully return with my pooch! Check em out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"OK, could the real 'morning Squeeze' please stand up?  Ive been to your place 2 days in a row and have had vastly different experiences  Day 1:  5 star - fantastic breakfast burrito, solid performance on the coffee Day 2: 1 star - cali benni - sloppy tasteless mush, coffee tasted like it came from a gas station.  Pleas be more consistent, you have a cool place, good waitresses, but whats with the inconsistency ????"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast.  Great location.  Surprisingly easy parking on Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambiance. Huge selection of roasted coffees and juices. I recommend the Jolt - frozen espresso goodness. The service is always up to speed and friendly."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here because it looked full every time I drove by. My husband and I came through during the tail end of brunch (on a Saturday). We were seated immediately and our server checked in on us. We weren't ready to order drinks so she made her rounds and checked in again. We asked for one more minute.. It was our first time here so we were thorough in reading the menu. We decided what we wanted, my husband went to and returned from the restroom, and still no server. 10 or so minutes had passed before our server came by and asked if anyone had taken care of us because they changed sections. If you are or have ever been a server before, which is the case for my husband and I, you can imagine our list of judgements and critiques was growing. She took our order and that was that. Our food arrived about 15 mins later. The expo didn't even give us a chance to look at our plate before walking off. After waiting more than 5 minutes my husband went up to the bar to request butter for the toast and ketchup for the breakfast potatoes *not impressed that a restaurant wouldn't plate butter and ketchup with toast and potatoes or at least train expos/servers to ask if their guest needs any condiments. A few minutes later our server checked in, at which point we had everything we needed. We finished our food... The southwestern omelet and chorizo tacos, both of which were good but had no wow to them. Our server dropped off our check and comped one of the meals. An appreciated gesture that really would not have been necessary had our server been present especially after discovering that in the section change we were forgotten. No matter how good the food may be, the poor experience is what keeps people from coming back."}
{"text":"I just picked up an order for breakfast to eat at home which is 5 min away. I ordered the eggs Benedict and my husband ordered the breakfast burrito. It was horrible and the worst presentation from a restaurant. He asked for light salsa and it was so drenched in salsa he had to eat it with a glove on. My eggs Benedict was far worse. No Potatoes on the side. It was cold. No flavor. And the egg was cracked and toppled over. When I opened up the box it this is what it looked like....for $10 I expected a much better meal"}
{"text":"BACKGROUND   I think Morning Squeeze in Old Town Scottsdale is a pretty cool place to have breakfast or lunch, and so does everyone else because it's always packed.  So what makes Morning Squeeze cool?  The location.   Morning Squeeze is located right in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale on Scottsdale Road at 4th Avenue half way between Indian School and Camelback.   The layout.   The main dining room opens up to the patio so every seat has a view of Scottsdale Road. This makes hanging out with friends and people watching super fun.  The menu.  Morning Squeeze combines traditional breakfast with fresh, organic, locally grown ingredients.   There is a wide variety of omelettes, eggs Benedict/poached egg plates including the classic, Cali Bene (with avocado & asparagus), Pulled Pork & veggie patty.   There is French toast, crêpes and pancakes including a healthy choice: Power Protein Pancake with protein, natural oats & flaxseed.   Morning Squeeze has all sorts of unique takes on traditional lunch items too - featuring salads, sandwiches, burgers and more.   The menu is outstanding and it would be impossible to ever get bored eating here.  For a full menu, go to morningsqueeze.com  CONCLUSION   The prices are very reasonable (most everything is between $6-$12) and the service is decent.  5/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE   *Hours: 6:30am - 2pm Daily  *For more information: MorningSqueeze.com"}
{"text":"This was our destination for the May Smunch.  There was some mix up with our reservation but we were still able to get one of the only two tables that were expandable for a party of more than 4.  From that point on the service and food were great.  I had a crab cakes Benedict that was really good and came with fresh fruit and perfect hash browns that were made even better with a mixture of ketchup and Sriracha."}
{"text":"Oh! Pigs eye bloodys! Full thick slice of bacon in my Bloody - Mmmmm! Trendy Decor. Amazingly good breakfast. Pancakes fresh fruit smoothies all sorts of benes! a true breakfast delite - I always order eggs benedict when I eat breakfast/ brunch out. It is one of those things that I do not like to cook at home, but love to eat. I love hollandaise. I really enjoy the flavors of bacon, egg and sauce blending into breakfast mimosa's. So incredibly delicious. If I can get crab or asparagus - Win Win! The bloody mary's were divine and I will say, if there is one breakfast place in the country I would traverse back to for bloody mary's and bene's - this is it!  Win!"}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale for a weekend and were looking for a brunch place. This place was the first one that popped up on yelp therefore we naturally stopped by.  There's nothing special about this place, it's 12pm and we're paying $18 for eggs. The staff was kinda attentive and kinda nasty at the same time. This place became busy so fast that our server was missing for at least 45min. I wonder if this place is the go to brunch place because the line was ridiculous to get in."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Tough ham, undercooked asparagus, undercooked eggs, and I'm not sure the kitchen even knows what hollandaise sauce is. This was an overall F for me. Our waitress Jessica was nice but the rest of this place was far from impressive."}
{"text":"Came in to get some food and was seated right away. Waited 20 min before our hostess came out and realized no server had been to our table yet. Waited another 5 min before our server came out and took our order. We then waited another 10 min and finally got tired of waiting for our coffee and left. After waiting 35-40 min we couldn't even get a cup."}
{"text":"This place is super cute, love the atmosphere! I got the biscuits and gravy and I can honestly say it was the best biscuits and gravy I have ever had! Fantastic flavor. I would go back for sure. They also had a lot of healthy options if you don't want a large breakfast."}
{"text":"An awesome little breakfast spot near old town Scottsdale. This is my first time visiting Scottsdale and I must say it's the best service I've had so far; my server was polite and brought out a doggy bowl with water for my sisters pup when she first came to the table. The food was simple and fresh as well as the vibe. They also have a dog friendly menu for all you pet owners out there which was a deal maker for me. Morning squeeze gets five stars from me for thoughtful and kind service and great food."}
{"text":"Food was good in general. Fast service and clean semi modern atmosphere. A bit pricey for breakfast though which takes away one star.  French toast was vert good with large pieces of bread. Shredded hash browns were done just right."}
{"text":"I took one of my training clients there ( who's also my friend) for the very first time. We loved the atmosphere, decor and vibe of the establishment! We thought right away this is going to be our new spot. Then it all happened..... the bartender was the worst one I've had. I use to own bars so I know the difference. We had to ask her several times for refills of water even when she saw our glasses empty but yet filled the persons up right next to us. Three other tables who came in 20 mins after received there food before us. We asked the bartender about this and she was rude. Our food came and the tomatoes were mushy and soggy. My dish wasn't even the right one. The bartender took it and didn't apologize or even ask what I would like to make this right. Instead she stammered off mad.     We felt uncomfortable and not welcomed. At this point we were not going to come back. Long story short, we asked for the manager. She came out and was as professional as one should and could be. That is what I expected from this establishment. She was gracious and apologetic. She then gave me a new fresh meal made right and a gift card to come back. Because of her professionalism we will come back and give it another try! Thank you to the two front desk hostesses for being so nice when we came in and after!  Update: My client ( a different one) and I came in after a training sesh to try it out again. Everyone was nice, professional and the new bartender was a doll! Food was delicious! I'm so glad we gave it another try! New spot for us now;)"}
{"text":"This was by far the worst service I have ever had. We waited 30 min to order then we waited 45min for our food and when I got it my order was wrong. The staff was not friendly or apologetic. The food was average for the wait. The best thing about this place was the comfy booth."}
{"text":"Great food, solid service and a very friendly and welcoming atmosphere. The Scottsdale Finest Hash and Breakfast Tacos are my favorite. Sometimes, I'll get a grilled cheese with tomato and avocado when I DGAF, so good.  I love the design of the place as well. It's got a retro, South Beach vibe. I'll be back and would recommend Morning Squeeze, \"The Squeeze\" to anyone!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is great. Bright colors, fast paced, nice servers. Carmel latte is awesome. I had eggs sausage and a pancake. It wasn't really anything spectacular. Kinda was hoping for something more local."}
{"text":"This place is adorable....just love the ambiance and the open patio.  As you walk in you see a wall of cute coffee cups, the hostess was very friendly...all the staff was just awesome.  We came to Morning Squeeze for an event after hours, so you know they all wanted to go home after a long morning/afternoon.  Again, they were all awesome!  They offered lunch for brunch menu and we got to sample a few items on their menu.  Everything we tried was very good- eggs, bacon, pancakes, fruit and their turkey omelet.  I can't wait to come back and try their a few of the omelets.  We sat at the bar and they had a full bar.... mimosa's, bloody Mary's and to our surprise BEERS!   The bartenders were friendly and very knowledgeable about their drinks.    Morning Squeeze is a fun place for breakfast, great menu and great selection at the bar."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast, very cute decor, dogs allowed on the patio and peppy friendly staff who despite being quite busy were going above and beyond. There was a bit of a wait when we got there but the front advised an accurate wait time and you can sit in some chairs in the shade while you wait outside. Pets are allowed on the patio and there were some cute puppies we also played with while waiting. The patio covers most of the different breakfast options you would expect. The mimosa flight was a tasty option, the kitchen was a bit slow so we ended up getting a second one on the house as well. I ordered the bagel and lox which was a full meal with lots of toppings and other table members had pancakes and one ordered off the lunch menu. Portions were large and prices were reasonable, even with the exchange rate it was less than most Calgary spots charge for brunch which is what I am used to."}
{"text":"Worst service in old town! 30 min to get a bottle of wine...when we asked the waitress which chard was more buttery her response wAs \"I don't know I don't drink wine\"...they brought out my friends first (we ordered at the same time) mine came out min later! I will probably never be back."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends while staying in the area for a weekend. Got seated pretty quickly and our order taken, however it took FOREVER for us to get our food, other ppl who came in after us had already eaten and left by the time our food had came out.  When the food arrived, 3 out of 4 of our orders were wrong, we let our waitress know and nothing was done about it. We figured we had already waited so long for our food to get here that we just wanted to eat and leave. My food was good and correct thats why im giving 3 stars.   After we were done eating and asked for boxes, we waited probably another 10-15 mins just for the lady to bring us our check.   Terrible service, but good food, if they get your order right. We will have to skip this place next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely worth the wait, and there will be one!  Very cute (busy) modern brunch spot! The waitresses are all very helpful & nice. There was so much on The menu I couldn't make up my mind, it all sounded (& looked, thanks yelp for pictures) so good. I ordered the \"cali beni\", it was perfect! Mimosas are a must, fresh juices! There was a little bit of a wait on the food, but the place was SO busy it was a Saturday morning. Still not complaining. Will definitely be back when I'm in the area! Thanks again"}
{"text":"Wouldnt serve me because my eyes are red? Yeah.... fuck   You. Also fuck you some more. Its hot in there and I dont know how the fuck you are still open with the breakfast club next to you. Ill make sure to put eye drops in before I go next time"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite breakfast place! My veggie omelet was fabulous! The service was amazing! And the ambiance was top notch! I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This 5 star review is for the bar/counter top dining experience I had this morning.  The location is an indoor/outdoor diner spot off of N Scottsdale Rd. Perfect for a leisurely breakfast whilst you enjoy the desert scape and passerby's. Out of habit, and preference, I always chose to sit at the counter and since the heat was already creeping up I sat inside as oppose to my second favorite location... The patio.  The indoor counter top faces N Scottsdale Rd. and offers a great view as well as A/C ( I'm still adapting to the heat)  I love the eclectic and artistic vibe that old town Scottsdale offers ... it is very much like Laguna's art walk area and a bit old town Pasadena.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy it was really hearty and delicious but more than the food I enjoyed my down-to-earth conversation with the bar/server she was such a sweetheart!  I stayed long after my meal and juice was finished just chatting it up and to be able to feel that welcomed and relaxed was completely appreciated!  A 5 star review for Morning Squeeze!"}
{"text":"My mother and I went in this morning for a birthday breakfast and were incredibly disappointed! She had the hangover bowl, a signature dish, and it was served without most of the things in it. When she brought this up to the server, the server brought a side of black beans for her to put in it, which were supposed to be included. It was also not warm. The server noticed that this was mostly uneaten when we asked for the check and offered to take it off, though, which was nice.   I had the build your own breakfast sandwich. Pretzel bun with egg, cheese, and I added spinach and avocado. No spinach, also not warm, and the avocado was brown. The bun was way too greasy. It was served with fruit, which had a hair in the bowl. We brought this up to the server, and she brought a new bowl of fruit, most of which was mushy.   We ordered a bloody mary and a hibiscus orange juice. Juice was incredibly sweet, both drinks were kind of warm. Overall, we left feeling very hungry and disappointed."}
{"text":"I've gone to morning squeeze in Old Town many times. This location is well designed and executed for interiors and customer comfort. I ordered the protein salad for takeout lunch and was pleased with the portion size of the salad and burger patty, and the flavors of both as well.   Phone service and hostess service for food pickup was polite and efficient in getting the job done."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom last weekend when I was visiting Scottsdale, and it was awesome. We can early enough, around 8am so there wasn't a wait but when we left at 9ish, the line was out the door.  Here are my pros: - Huge, diverse and well explained menu. There is something for everyone here. I was boring and got the basic eggs and sausage plate, and it was delicious but I should have been adventurous. Mom got the Denver Omelette and she finished it wish a huge grin, loved it! - Pets are allowed! As a dog lover I couldn't be happier that this was a pet friendly place. - Price, very fair! Nothing was really over $12 and the portions were generous. - Healthy and fresh ingredients  Cons: - At times the wait was a little much but it's popular so what can we expect?   Overall, be sure to try it if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I really like morning squeeze ! The caramel latte is absolutely fantastic, that being said the food can be hit or miss. I've only ever eaten breakfast here so I really can't review their lunch menu. I usually get the thigh master omelette , some days its really tasty but other days it can be kinda meh. Other than that I have no complaints ! Sometimes the service can be slow , but I've always had very friendly waitresses. I think this is one of the better places for breakfast in old town Scottsdale. Plus it has a dog friendly patio ! YAY!"}
{"text":"This experience at Morning Squeeze went from \"ok\" to \"EXTREMELY AWFUL\" within a matter of minutes! I stopped in for brunch a few weeks ago hoping to cure my taste buds with a hearty meal and enjoy the sunday funday setting.   Our waitress was resourceful about the menu, full of energy, and brought the food out within a reasonable amount of time. At that particular moment, with great service, I just knew things couldn't get any better than they already were. Unfortunately I was correct...they got worst.   After paying out the tab and leaving the table....I walk out to realize my wallet is still inside on the table. Within less than \"2 minutes\" of being outside of the restaurant near the front door, I went back inside to find my wallet gone.   The employee who cleaned our table, whom also had a history of being accused (info from server) of stealing things had immediately disappeared. I asked for them to review the security system, but was told they didn't have any cameras in their restaurant. Surprising to hear being in their location..you would think they had some type of monitors in place.   Not only was my wallet stolen within minutes, but there was also not one type of acknowledgement of the situation from the general manager who was on site the entire time. She walked passed me several times...no eye contact, smiles, or any type of addressing what just happened. The crazy part is they \"allegedly\" couldn't find the bus boys phone number & personal information.   If you want an incompetent staff who shows up for a daily paycheck and looks the other way when things go wrong, this is your place."}
{"text":"This pretzel bun is so on point! The country potatoes are crunchy and perfect! It's always delivered perfectly exactly what we ordered and extra condiments. My sister got \"the lox\" she said it's perfect with tons of salmon! We also got a strawberry smoothie it is so delicious! We door dash it and it always comes fast and hot! We ate it too fast for beautiful pictures. (Sorry) EAT HERE"}
{"text":"The breakfeast is great but i ordered the waffle and my wife an omlelette and both came out lukewarm, dont know why they call it the squeeze! The OJ is out of a carton and NOT fresh squeezed!!"}
{"text":"Crazy good place for breakfast or lunch. Great food and atmosphere. Everything very fresh and you can be healthy or way not so much. I have an example of the latter. Bacon vodka Bloody Mary with, oh yeah, bacon garnish. Selfish."}
{"text":"Incredible breakfast! Surf and turf omelet is awesome and mimosas are very good! Service is okay, but they are always busy so be considerate, the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because of the wait for a table but its because the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Boom Baby awesome breakfast  What a great place to have breakfast you sit out at the porch you've got great views the food is outstanding I can't think of a better place to spend an early-morning then here"}
{"text":"Long ass wait for mediocre food. Cold eggs , moist has browns, bland Mexican, so many better places nearby avoid this place.  Very loud"}
{"text":"I love this place! The color schemes are so fun and mimosas are cheap! 6$ and way worth it. The pancakes are fluffy and they have amazing protein shakes in various flavors.  Me and my girls come here after exams to destress and its now a tradition!"}
{"text":"Great food, cool place. Why is there a word limit. Service was good. Good spot on mill next to my favorite restaurant zipps"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast weekend and was pretty excited! I'm writing this as I sit here for two hours waiting for our food. The food was decent but nothing I would wait 2 hours for ever again. The food on the breakfast weekend menu was limited to one option and that option wasn't something I liked so I had to buy something 3x as expensive.  After writing, proofreading, and editing...I'm still waiting for my food."}
{"text":"Love Morning Squeeze!! It had been a few years since I was here for breakfast and I did notice the menu changed. Last time I was here I got some sort of Crab omelet, which they didn't have anymore.. boo!   So this time I got a Smoked Salmon bagel & it was soooo good! They also have delicious fresh squeezed orange juice. My dad got a Southwest Omelet & my mom a Breakfast Sandwich, they both said they were great. A great choice for breakfast when in Old Town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I've had breakfast here three times over the last three months and it's been very good! I pretty much get the same thing every time though; egg white omelette with veggies, coffee and fruit. I sat at the bar each time and never had an issue with service. My waitress even suggested almond milk for my coffee when I wanted to try something different to mellow that bitter coffee taste. The only thing I'd change is that the fruit has been hit or miss as far as taste and ripeness. I love the people watching, especially on a Sunday morning as the hipsters roll in after a late night of fun. Parking is a big pain too but it's good to park further and get a little walk in. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cool looking place, it is very small.  They do have a small bar inside. I had an omelet I think called the Florence, it was made from egg whites and had ricotta and spinach inside.  It was good but a little greasy and the ricotta gets to be too much as you get towards the middle of the omelet.  Fruit was good although kind of warm and English muffin was large-not bad but the bottom was hard as a rock.  Server was nice and food is pretty cheap but for about the same prices I would probably choose the Good egg over this.  The menu is pretty big, I would go back to try other items like the pancakes and smoothies."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in town, this is place is a must! Fresh squeezed orange juice although a little pricey, is delicious. And what could be better than combining breakfast with the best dessert ever??Creme brûlée pancakes are to die for. Make sure to check this place out."}
{"text":"Stopped here before a morning hike on my last day visiting the area.   Seating was very quick and our waitress came by for drinks quickly. I got the fresh squeezed OJ and it was superb!! Definitely tell that it was fresh and just the right sweetness to start the morning.   She was also really knowledgable of the menu, making a few suggestions and shaving the local favorites.   I ordered the Biscuits and gravy with the sides eggs (scrambled). The eggs were a bit over cooked but nothing terrible. The b&w were definitely a great choice! The gravy has some sausage bits and a little spice but it's honestly more of an after taste of spice than that immediate peppery taste a lot of gravies have.   The only reason for the -1 star: it did take a little longer than expected for the food to come out.   Overall though, glad I made the stop and would enjoy trying some other local favorites next time."}
{"text":"Cute place.. but what I ordered wasn't great. I got biscuits and gravy and the biscuits were very hard and the gravy was cold. The coffee tasted burnt.   2 biscuits & gravy, a *tiny* side of hash browns and a coffee was $10. I doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"One of the 5 best places in the area to have breakfast along with N'Counter, AM Snooze, Farm & Craft, Breakfast Club. The diner style decorating fits along well with the hugely excellent menu and tasty food. Get and Americano coffee to top it off and there's no reason to leave. Very dog friendly (I don't care about that) for anyone who wants to dine with their loyal companion. Great talent working here to help your eyes in the morning."}
{"text":"$5.75 for orange juice? It better be harvested from the groves deep within the kingdom of mordor, past the misty mountains and the shire, in a place where simpler things prevail, where a man can wet his whistle in peace, amongst brethren who've also tasted the glories of battle against the army of sauron. Toasts not bad tho."}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday brunch anticipating a better experience than a year ago. Seated promptly on patio, place doesn't seem overly busy, food still not to table after 1 hour. Taking food to go(still haven't got it yet) but might update review on how the food was. The muffin which I ordered as well took over 20 minutes to arrive...Too many good breakfast spots in old town, won't be back.  Update: We ate food that we took to go and it was 3/10. No bueno"}
{"text":"UPDATE: After Morning Squeeze management reached out apologizing for the bad experience I'd had, I decided to give the restaurant a second chance. I am so delighted to report that the service was night and day! Hats off to the manager Leslie for being on top of her kitchen - she is a class act and a big reason the restaurant seems to now be thriving. The food came out way faster than expected, and the taste was on point. I also gave their peach pear smoothie a try and definitely recommend it for a nice, light refreshing treat. Thank you Morning Squeeze! I will definitely be coming back again.     Truly wish I could give them a higher rating, but the kitchen needs to get its act together. The first time I came the service was decent; today it was not. Seems like it's hit or miss. Waited for more than an hour to get food, and had to start snacking on whatever I had in my purse. The server felt so bad she even brought a comp side dish while I waited. By the time the entree arrived I was full and everything was just backwards. While I did come in during a busy day, this length of a delay is inexcusable. If you're willing to wait a long time to get your food, I recommend. If not, go elsewhere. Disappointing, as I really enjoy the ambiance."}
{"text":"Good server and nice atmosphere, but the cooks are truly clueless beginners. Salmon wasn't fresh, eggshells were found in our eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"First off, the staff was very nice and accommodating. Our waitress was very nice when we complained about the food.... but the food was so awful. It was probably the worst breakfast place I've ever been to. The potatoes were raw, the hollandaise was literally like water, ex. The best thing on my plate was the garnish orange slice. Even the coffee was watery.. I'm giving 1.5 since the waitress was helpful but please just avoid this place. The food was overpriced even for good food. Save your money, the food was that bad."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I had high hopes this place would knock it out of the park. The location is great and the ambiance is fantastic. My experience here during Sunday brunch however, was terrible. We were seated promptly outside and our orders were immediately taken. Fast forward 45 minutes, and all we're left with at the table, was water and some over priced OJ which tasted as if it were from concentrate. The waitress kept stressing that they were slammed and our food would be up in a few moments. Alas, the food shows up, basically half cooked. The eggs were undercooked and watery, and my friend's breakfast burrito was dry and bland.   If you like undercooked, bland breakfast food, then this place is for you. Otherwise, there are other alternatives in the area for brunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious breakfast amid a great retro ambiance. Our waitress, Chelsea, was a doll....very personable and attentive. We will be back and highly recommend. Side note: coffee could've been a smidge hotter."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time the other morning and really liked it. It's super cute inside with lots of little colorful booths. It was really bright in general inside and the waitresses were wearing bright colors too so it just felt cheery in there (and I liked that grass/turf wall). My boyfriend and I both got a benedict. He got the Friends with Bennies (lobster and crab) and I got the classic. Both were good. I got potatoes and he got hash browns, the hash browns were delicious but super buttery. They have a lot of good coffee drink options too (I want to try the orange chai). Our waitress was friendly and it's reasonably priced. I definitely want to go back and I hope this place sticks around because I feel like everything that goes into this building doesn't last :(. Oh yeah and I liked the set up how it was like open to the little patio, it made it feel beachy. Maybe it was because I had beach on the brain since we were heading to SD the following week, but whatever."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review and I am writing this strictly due to the poor service this establishment has. I came in and wasn't even acknowledged by the snobby hostess who later greeted me after I made myself clear that I had been waiting for so long. I ended up walking out because of this."}
{"text":"I only gave this place 2 stars because the ambiance was nice and food was just ok! Our service was bad, she didn't check on us at all and took a long time to greet us even though it wasn't busy. Never checked on us after we receive our food until she dropped off the check. I had to ask someone else for more water  I might try this place one more thing me to give it a second chance. Had the gluten free pancakes so it was nice finding a restaurant that serves GF but the turkey sausage was over cooked and dry!"}
{"text":"Cool decor and great location. Service was fine. Food was not good!  3 of us got eggs benni (3 different kinds). Of the 6 eggs, 5 were over cooked with hard yolks, the English muffins were dry and there was very little hollandaise sauce. The 4th person got an omelette and said it was dried out and just not good quality. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The Southwestern omelet might just be the best omelet I have ever had. The thing that earned the fifth star though is how pet friendly they are. They have a tables on the patio for people with pets. They have water bowls for the pets too. Best part? They have a section of the menu just for pets. My dog went crazy for the chicken and eggs. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Morning Squeeze is for sure my main squeeze! This place is awesome, from the biscuits and gravy to the mimosas it's never a disappointment. The service is five star and I always feel like the most important customer.  10/10 would definitely recommend to a friend and will always come back."}
{"text":"This is my fave spot in Scottsdale to eat. Shout out to Gino & his crew, I miss you guys. The food is good & the service is friendly. The staff works hard on getting it right... I appreciate all the efforts, keep up the good work. Thank you."}
{"text":"Great service but the potatoes were burned and cold. Poached eggs were good.  Lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just a little place on a corner in Scottsdale, I dropped in and had a bran muffin & coffee while waiting for family that was roaming and shopping nearby.  The muffin was surprisingly good!  Coffee was decent, too.  The bright, colorful sign stood out in the broad and open intersection, so the restaurant is easy to spot and would be a handy gathering place."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait on the weekend to get a table, but it's worth it. Seriously some of the best eggs benny ever! I had the crab cake eggs benedict and it was sublime. Everyone at the table enjoyed their breakfast. My buddy had the breakfast burrito, which he raved about. Definitely coming back!  The only thing I'd do different is not get the gin/vodka bloody mary combo. Sounds crazy, I know. It tastes like gin and vodka combined. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Would have given them five if they made classic eggs Benedict the right way!!!! I always pray when I try a new breakfast place that they will use Canadian bacon. I just don't like salty ham on my Benny.  But the place is great. We were the hung over ones everyone is referring to. I ended up with classic scrambled eggs and toast. Perfect. Fresh juice. Perfect. Coffee-perfect. Energy and hydration returning, I checked out my copilots Belgian waffle and it was crunchy and made me want one, too. But I was satisfied with a bite. Perfectly cooked. Doggies bickering on the patio, tourists peeking in at you. Another perfect day in Old Town.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and awesome decor. I usually never venture out and try different things for breakfast, but their menu has so many interesting items on it. The eggs benedict with the crab cake is so delicious! The patio is dog friendly, and they have free wi-fi."}
{"text":"Our first time in  this am. Great food and service. Thanks folks. Will return. On the Best Of list"}
{"text":"Nice coffee and breakfast spot right on Scottsdale Road. Coffee is fresh hot and strong the way we like it. Staff is quick with the re-fills and always offer a cup for the road. Breakfast items range from typical comfort foods to healthier options. While your are eating and sipping, you can watch the world pass your by, and that can be good thing! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Waitress and staff are nice.due to the third try pancakes, cold toast and undercooked hash browns it was a poor experience.  4 stars for comping the pancakes. ....doing the right thing."}
{"text":"Generally I don't like to leave negative reviewed based off of food I had delivered, however I decided to make an exception. We ordered food through Eat24. The food was delivered by GrubHub. I ordered the food at 11:04 AM and was told food should arrive between 11:40 to 11:50 AM. Food arrived at approximately 12:15 PM. No big deal.   The woman who delivered the food was very nice. She did mention that she had advised them that I wanted a Vanilla Latte and not a Caramel, so I assume the extra time it took to get the food delivered was due to their mistake. Also, when I had ordered this through the app, it advised to call to get the flavors of Lattes. I called the number, no one answered and it went to a voicemail box which was full. The Latte itself was bland and had no flavor.  My boyfriend and I opened our meals and the first thing we noticed, was the bread was ridiculously stale. He had Rye and I had Wheat. Two totally different types of bread, so you would assume only one of them may have been stale, but both...? Our omelettes we're just average. I noticed what I thought was mold on a bell pepper in the country potatoes...turned out to be a label which was not removed. Poor meal prepping by whomever cut up the bell peppers.   Overall, under-impressed and disappointed. Will not be on my list of places to go in the future...sorry Morning Squeeze."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice but the food wasnt so great. We were sat right by the expo window and i saw my boyfriends meal completed and sitting there and a server asked about the other half of the ticket, my meal, and the cook said \"oh shit!\" and started to cook a grilled chicken breast sandwich. My bf asked if he could get his food instead of it sitting on the counter getting cold waiting for mine.  When mine came out the sandwich was pretty good but i paid extra money for garlic fries which was literally plain fries on top of a couple pieces of garlic that were basically cut in huge pieces and not cooked, you couldnt even see the garlic until u dug it out from the bottom of the plate but even then who wants a huge slice of raw garlic on their fry that wont even stick to it u have to put some ketchup on it first to stick the garlic to it. My bfs biscuit and gravy was hard as a rock and sent it back. I work at a breakfast joint so i guess im more critical to basics. On the plus side the oj and iced tea was great"}
{"text":"Sat around for over 40 mins waiting for our food this morning before being told \"the kitchen is backed up\".  We ordered breakfast not a well done steak and lobster dinner. In that 40 min time frame, the server only came by once to fill our water before coming back again to say our food would take longer. Eventually, the table next to us, who complained about the same issue, left before we decided to just walk out as well. From being sat to leaving it was around 50 mins for two basic breakfast orders before we left without having gotten anything but waters. Oh and the food, way overpriced.  I wish I could say it was worth the money but I didn't even get my food. But based on other reviews, I doubt it would be.  All that being said, if you want to just waste you life sitting around doing nothing, this is your spot."}
{"text":"Eh.  My omelet was burnt and really really gross. HOwerver, the wait staff saw and immediately stated they would get me something else and remove this from the bill, which I appreciated. I'm not able to fully comment becuase I simply had scrambled eggs after the gross omelet, and those were good.  I had a delicious boozy, frozen drink that was absolutely delicious.  I'll give them one more chance since the waitress was so helpful with my obviously burnt omelet."}
{"text":"Went to Morning Squeeze at the new Tempe location. Ordered an omelette and asked for cottage cheese and tomato instead of potatoes and toast. They put the cottage cheese inside the omelet and burnt the omelet. Not what I expected at all. Not a happy patron at all. I could have cooked a better breakfast for $20."}
{"text":"The place seemed busy enough for a Saturday morning. We had a 20 minute wait but found friends and crashed their table.  Bartender was nice and attentive enough but not overly friendly, which seemed to be the theme for the staff here. We had to tell our waitress a joke in order to get her to crack a smile. I get it... They hire pretty and it's appreciated, especially for breakfast. But the girls could smile a little.  I ordered the burrito, which came highly recommended but I couldn't understand why. It was bland and hard to tell the ingredients because they were so mashed together the inside looked like something I would feed my dog. I also didn't feel very good immediately following breakfast. It wasn't pleasant.  My buddy had an Denver omelet and said it was awesome. So maybe that's a better way to go.  The wait for food was a little longer than expected also.  Overall, I would t recommend it but I wouldn't write it off. Order the omelet, the burrito is overrated."}
{"text":"Pretty miserable experience at this place. Went for brunch and the place was about 70% full, definitely not packed and there was no wait. The server came over and took our drink order quickly but that was about the only thing that was quick about the whole experience. We ordered an eggs Benedict with hash browns (extra crispy) and a black and bleu burger (medium rare) that was supposed to have caramelized onions, black peppercorn patty, and Cajun spices.  40 minutes went by and there was still no food. When the food finally arrived, the eggs Benedict was actually cold to the touch and rubbery, the hash browns were close to undercooked and very far from \"extra crispy\", and you can tell the entire plate had been sitting there waiting for a solid 15 minutes at least. The burger was warm but was completely gray on the inside, totally missing the caramelized onions, no black peppercorn, and whatever \"Cajun spices\" that were supposed to be on there seemed to be just salt. Burger was overall way too greasy as well and that's a shame because you could tell it started as quality ground beef, I could've make something better on my own grill and that's pretty sad. Fries were also cold to the touch and generally unimpressive.  If .5 stars was an option I would've chosen that, but I guess the only positive part of the experience is that the server was at least nice. I won't ever be back."}
{"text":"We honestly can't review the food, as having waited for over an hour  and fifteen minutes without recieving  anything other than a \"sorry, ten minutes we promise\" (three separate times), we had to leave to catch our 12'clock appointment. I know breakfast joints can get busy, particularly on a Sunday morning, but since we were sat at 10:15, we figured we'd have plenty of time. Even so, we thought we'd order something quick. I could even understand if we had ordered something super complicated or many courses...we ordered a smoothie bowl and a side of biscuits n' gravy. Like...its a smoothie, over some granola and fresh fruit, no cooking required. Biscuits shouldn't take all that long either (I'd assume as an available side for most breakfast plates you'd have them coming out of the oven regularly), and proper gravy can't be made quickly so it should be handy for breakfast service.  We weren't the only patrons having issues either, many of the other guests there were grumbling about the hour plus wait times. I understand it can be hectic on weekends, but you're a breakfast joint. You should thrive on the breakfast rush, god knows that's the only time you're open.  I wouldn't have posted the review if management had made any attempt to make it right.  Instead he came over and said \"don't worry about the bill, we hope you try us again\"  Don't worry about the bill? For the food we didn't receive? For the smoothie we waited for, for over an hour and never got? Damn right we're not worrying about the bill. And for the record, next breakfast in scottsdale we're trying someplace else.  Dude, get your kitchen in shape. There are so many excellent breakfast joints in old town, if you can't get food to your guests then you're not going to be one of them."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint. Coffee is good and they have a good morning cocktail menu. Service was excellent! The country potatoes could use a bit more seasoning and flavor and were a bit cold which is why I rated it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Love eating at The Morning Squeeze every time I'm in Scottsdale!  Friendly staff, great food & Laura behind the bar is awesome!"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars!  I LOVE Breakfast and Morning Squeeze has a pretty cool menu - I am glad we stopped!  Started with delicious coffee and a bloody mary then onto a huge breakfast with friends.... Omelets and bacon and hash browns (delivered late but I forgive)  My favorite breakfast of the trip!"}
{"text":"Visited on 3/11/16. Didn't start well when it took at least  20 minutes to take our order. Both omlettes ordered were burnt and one of them wasn't the right kind of omlette. Waitress wasn't very professional when dealing with it. Overall disappointed with the Morning Squeeze and with myself since there are many places to choose from in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast as they do it until 2:30pm. Have been here several times only to be extremely happy with the quality of the food, drinks and service. Definitely a local gem which is close to home for us.. Try it out, you will NOT be disappointed.."}
{"text":"I love the food. I love the atmosphere here.  Minus 1 star because of service :( The servers seem really uninterested in the customers and more interested in carrying on their own personal conversations. :("}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, sitting outside calms the nerves, and their Sunday Mimosa flights are 3$!  We have Sunday brunch on a regular basis here but the last three time have been some of the WORST service. I literally thought our table existed in an alternate dimension beyond the sight of severs. Each time, as my stomach started to eat itself, I was forced to ask the staff: is this table usable or simply decorative?"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and vintage look. Sunday morning and the place was packed but we found space at the bar. Food was tops but the service was not great. Took forever to get our food and our server was lass than helpful."}
{"text":"Can't imagine how this place has only 3 stars. Our family of four loved every single dish they ordered. This is by far the best breakfast any of us have ever had. We plan to return as many times as we can while we are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Pig's Eye Bacon Bloody Mary, say whaaa?!  After months of deprivation I was in desperate need of bacon. That and a brunch spot that would meet the needs of some of my favorite ladies (mimosas, moderate prices, deliciousness). This place fit the bill to perfection.   It was a fantastic day for patio dining and the service was splendid. We had a lot of catching up to do and the server was ever so patient while we did. She also helped us work out the best combination to satisfy all of our day drinking desires and breakfast/lunch cravings. The decor of the space was darling and was situated in an ideal locale for people watching. The only downside for me might have been the early closing time, as I could of used just one more hour to take it all in:) That aside, it was a brunch for the books. Yum."}
{"text":"Good food good vibe have to take one star back because took  a while to get food it was a Sunday probably be expected but not up to par. Had to wait forever to get a drink refill and to pay for out food."}
{"text":"Sitting in the exterior portion of the bar this morning in a bustling Morning Squeeze was reminiscent of being on a cruise.  The mild weather and breeze, the tropical colors of the decor, the permeating smell of bacon, and the clatter of dishes and silverware all felt like the breakfast buffet on the lido deck of a Caribbean cruise liner.  The food provided a similar feeling in that it was good to be hard to find specific complaints, but not so good as to be memorable in and of itself.  That's fine on a cruise because breakfast is nothing more than an opportunity to fuel up before a day of shore excursions, and honestly for a hip Scottsdale breakfast spot there may not be any need to have great food to attract a crowd.  For my money, I want better than tolerable for a $17 out-the-door price for coffee, meal, and tip because there are plenty of better, cheaper breakfast spots in the area and many of those have the added benefit of not being the starting point for Sunday-Funday.  Much like a Caribbean cruise, the staff and patrons were all attractive and well put together for a 9:30 breakfast; most being dressed as lightly as politely acceptable.  In a way, it's a continuation or new start to the Scottsdale social scene, with pickups still occurring.  Every part of the service at the bar was prompt.  Quickly provided water and menu, my Americano came out quickly and all the usual barrista questions were asked (which comes down to \"hot or cold?\"), and once I assumed the I've-looked-at-the-menu-and-am-ready-to-order pose a bartender was there to take my order.  I witnessed a food-prep snafu regarding the diners beside me--their order was taking a while so they asked the bartender to check on it.  She promptly investigated and was quite candid in letting them know that the kitchen didn't put together their custom sandwich (a menu option) correctly and redid it.  A minute or so later she came back to let the diners know their meals would be comped.  It was an impressive level of candor and remedy in a situation that could easily have been covered up.  The food, as indicated above, was satisfying but not exceptional.  It's not something I'm in a hurry to return for...  I had the country fried steak and eggs--two eggs any style, hash browns or country potatoes, toast, some fruit, and country fried steak with sausage gravy atop.  The steak could have really used a crisper fry and some more breading to give it a nice crunch and to provide a vehicle for some pepper.  Otherwise, it was tasty and the sausage gravy was a good topping.  The rest of the dish 'was what I thought it was'...which is to say, eggs and toast and potatoes are routine.  My neighbors' dishes looked underwhelming.  3 of the 4 had a breakfast sandwich, which was served without a side.  I'm not sure if that's by choice or design, but it definitely makes for an unimpressive plate.  The remaining person ordered french toast, which looked amazing in that it seemed to have the crispy batter my steak lacked, but also was plated and served with no accompaniment than syrup--the side of bacon had to be specifically ordered separately.  In a way, perhaps, Morning Squeeze is the perfect metaphor for Scottsdale - everything looks nice, but scratch the surface and you'll find the beauty is only skin deep...despite that, you'll still find yourself satisfied and ok with enjoying good looks.  Ok, that's a little dramatic, but I'm more focused on football than metaphor right now."}
{"text":"This was delicious. We ordered in delivery which got to us super fast (regardless of the quoted 45 min wait) we had our food in less than 30 minutes. The smoothies were delicious and the perfect texture. I got a build your own breakfast sandwich which was spot on delicious and came with more sausage than I thought it would. One person got hash brown which are cooked in butter and perfectly seasoned. One other person got the veggie omelet which she said was superb. 10/10 would recommend and will be ordering from there again"}
{"text":"We come here quite a bit and let me start by saying not every experience has been 5 stars. But there has always been a way they have made us come back by making the wrongs right. The host Bre or Bri is my favorite. She always welcomes us and Is so friendly.   Our server today Briana was fantastic. She is now one of my top servers. Very quick. And doesn't make you think you are bothering her by asking for something else. :) we will Keep returning."}
{"text":"I will never go back to this place !!! Service was friendly but food was horrible. The three of us who ate there had an upset stomach !! I had heart burn all day :( the bar was dirty and disgusting (we should have known better) I really don't recommended this place :( sad sad sad the star goes to the server ONLY   Food, ambiance and presentation of the restaurant (dirty) get a BIG 0"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday morning at 6:30 hoping to beat the Sunday Funday crowd, but opening was delayed half an hour due to some overnight break in or something or other.  There were cops, and I wasn't asking for details because honestly I didn't care to ask.  But either way, not their fault someone broke in and caused a ruckus or whatever it was.  There were two different outdoor patio areas, and I'm going to assume that both are dog friendly.  I walked in the patio thats parallel to the main road so I could sit at the bar with my little homie.  I ordered a few mimosas, the classic bene, and a side of toast for myself.  Mimosas weren't bad, a bottomless or carafe option would be nice though.  Classic bene came with a side of hashbrowns and an orange slice.  Bene was pretty good, not amazing, but pretty good, and decently priced.  Hashbrowns I thought were a little on the undercooked side.  And toast is toast, although I don't think it came buttered.  But didn't matter to me, I like toast with my bene so I can soak up all the gooey protein/cholesterol goo mixed with the leftover hollandaise drenched in hot sauce.  For my little homie, I ordered him the Chow Hound Scramble.  And he didn't like it.  But then again, he is, by far, the pickiest puppy you will ever meet.  It was like a mix of plain scrambled eggs, cheese, and chicken.  Eventually I picked out all the chicken bits by hand and he happily wolfed them down.  Service: It was a little slow, but it was brunch on Sunday Funday.  I sat at the bar so all my orders went through the bartender.  I didn't catch her name, but she was nice, and I thought the service was pretty good overall despite some of the negative reviews you'll find here.  Wait for food was about 15-20 minutes, even though I was here right when they opened.  Along with the 20+ other people who were there with me due to the delayed opening.    Things that could have been better:  the chow scramble came in a little styrofoam bowl, and I would assume the other options for furry friends come in the same.  I was a little worried my little homie would bite off a chunk of the bowl and swallow it down.  Lucky for me, he only ate the chicken bits once I pulled them out and fed him by hand.  Also, they could have offered a water bowl for the little guy, but I wasn't too concerned, it's a 5 minute walk and he wasn't thirsty anyway.  And the hashbrown thing, just slightly undercooked.    Overall: 3.5 rounded up to 4, because all the servers were super nice and were super friendly.  Probably because my puppy is cuter than your puppy.  My little homie got much love.  I didn't see this place listed as dog friendly, but it is very much so.   One more bit of randomness: they have the little hook things under the bar and under tables, which was nice to tie off the little homie's leash.  And I suppose you could hang a purse or backpack or whatever on the hooks if you really wanted to."}
{"text":"Dog friendly with a couple things you can actually order for your pooch! I've been coming here since I've moved to Scottsdale, and I always have a great experience. The owner (I believe) even works on the floor which is great to see that she is so involved in the business. Great food, I always get the veggie omelet or the belfer fit bowl. They have really good protein shakes too!"}
{"text":"We came here twice, once for brunch and once for lunch. I come here for brunch again, but not lunch. Their mimosa flights are really good. Their pancakes and breakfast food all in all are pretty good. When we came back for lunch, I ordered a burger medium well. It came out burnt on the outside and somewhat crunchy. I couldn't eat it. Definitely a brunch place, not so much for later in the day."}
{"text":"One of my go to staples when I'm in Scottsdale. To be honest, I go here more for the vibe than anything else. Grab a seat at the u shaped bar for some awesome people watching and (usually) some good convo with the bartender.    I do like that the menu is healthy focused and has awesome options for those of us who work out and stick to a meal plan/diet. The oj is fresh squeezed and the coffee is really great with full body, not bitter flavor."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! My hubby ordered the Scottdales finest hash. It was made with canned corned beef and had a smallest toast that was stale and hard. My daughter ordered the Cali bene with brown avocado and an over cooked poached eggs   It looked like a hard boiled egg. I ordered the breakfast burrito that was cold inside with ice cold stale hash brown on the side. We came coz they were dog friendly and had a patio. We ordered the family pup a chow hound scramble. Can you believe it our pup didn't eat it! What dog won't eat scrambled eggs with chicken?!?! That's gotta tell you something!!! And my hubbys portion was so small the doggie portion was bigger than his plate!!! Complete joke for what they charge!!! I do not think they make the food fresh as ordered. I never give such a negative review but it was horrendous!!! Such a fail and disappointment. Needless to say we will not be back. I give this joint negative 5 stars."}
{"text":"I own an office nearby and am here often.   Great staff. Delicious food (especially the French toast for breakfast and BLT for lunch), and super cool atmosphere and ambiance.  In the winter, the patio is a fab place to sit."}
{"text":"I love Morning Squeeze!   1) They serve breakfast even during lunch 2) Their Eggs Benedict is awesome 3) They have a dog-friendly patio 4) They have Gluten Free toast 5) Mimosas!  I've tried almost everything on the breakfast menu, and it's all yummy! Build your own breakfast sandwich, eggs benedict, omelets... All the waitresses have been great (I say waitresses and not wait staff because literally the only people who work there are women under 30. Not sure what that says about the owner.. But I digress). Good location, cute decor. I don't have a single complaint!"}
{"text":"Experienced maybe the worst service you can imagine this morning. Although our server was very kind and sweet, as well as most of the serving staff - We waited over an hour from the time we ordered until the food was on our table. I understand it's a busy Saturday morning but this was a travesty. I will never go back and will tell everyone I know to stay away. The food was average at best and I was upset the manager waited until we got our food to mention she was sorry and made up some pathetic excuse as to why it took so long. There is no excuse - accept the fact that you screwed up, tell your customer and offer to give a size-able or full discount, period. She did neither and I was clearly upset. My meal should've been free. This place is a disgrace. Zero stars"}
{"text":"Wish I could give a better review, but wasn't able to try the food. Got seated outside with a great view of old town, but no ever came to say good morning or anything. We waited 10-15 minuets and finally had to leave. If they where busy I could understand but it's Monday morning and not full at all. Not sure if I'll try again poor service is on my unforgivably list."}
{"text":"chicken club. do it. probably one of the better club-type sandwiches I've had.  amazing food, cute interior (sit outside!), and attentive service. people watching from here is fun, too!"}
{"text":"Great food and love their menu for my pooch! This is our 3rd time in two weekends! Really like the wait staff and atmosphere. Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant with lots of healthy breakfast options. My Spinach Florentine omelette was quite tasty. They also have different smoothies, protein shakes, and a variety of espresso drinks. Next time I'm going to bring my puppies to dine on the dog-friendly patio.   The only thing I didn't like was that they charge extra to substitute fruit for toast. That wasn't mentioned on the menu, nor did our server ask if that was okay. I hate being punished for eating healthy."}
{"text":"Love this place. I'm here right now as I'm writing this. I come here like 3 to 4 times a week. Super friendly staff no matter who you get. It feels like a small town restaurant. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I went to Morning Squeeze this morning with a few friends. I do breakfast a lot in Scottsdale but it was my first time here. They have a very wide selection of foods to choose from. We started off with a blueberry muffin which was amazing, I highly recommend. The service was great and fast! We also had a Bloody Mary which I would 100% get again! The food was also very good, I will for sure be coming back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I love this place the food is amazing and they have great lattes my only complaint is that the staff is all a bunch of young girls with bad attitudes. The service sux."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 4/5 Happiness - 3.5/5  Morning squeeze is close by to the Breakfast Club, and I definitely prefer this one. The bread here is top notch. Every slice tastes freshly-made and is toasted very well. The eggs are cooked expertly and while the fries and breakfast potatoes don't look like much, they pack big flavor into them.   The wait-staff has always been upbeat, particularly Cami. They have added $2.00 mimosas on the weekdays, which is made with fresh-squeezed orange juice. A definite recommend for both breakfast and lunch (where their grilled chicken sandwich is to die for).   My big complaint comes from the last trip there, where they started cleaning the grill during our meal. Some pretty bad odors wafted through the restaurant as a result (and they were seating new guests to boot, it's not like we were there past closing time). It's small mistakes like that which keeps the ever-elusive fifth star from being awarded.  The location is right on Scottsdale Road and parking is very difficult. Be prepared to walk a bit to make it to the restaurant."}
{"text":"I wish this place were a little faster with their food and faster with beverages but I will not prevent them from their 5 star rating because of it. Oh and if they could be open later that would be great too. Why waste a perfectly good establishment and be closed half the day and all night? This is my \"go to\" breakfast spot. i crave their lox and egg whites."}
{"text":"I LOVE their chicken Caesar salad. Big portion with one of my favorite dressings! If your a blacktag member at Corepower Yoga you also get a discount on food!"}
{"text":"2 stars for now. I know they just opened but...  First of all, a star for the decor and ambiance. It's so cute and colorful and comfy! We were worried there would be a wait (the place seemed packed) but were able to snag a spacious booth overlooking the kitchen. This may seem like a great idea, but I was able to watch food get sent back (3 different meals in the time we waited for ours) and see how long certain plates were left under hot lamps. Being able to watch the kitchen in action is neat in theory, but if you're well-versed in the ways of restaurant life, you'll catch these problems easily.  Another star for service. Our server was sweet but slow...because I think she was overwhelmed. She would disappear for long stretches (as in, I couldn't find her in the whole place) and it took forever for coffee refills because they were out of glasses. Again, I don't fault her at all. I think that she must have been slammed. Every table in the place was taken.  The food? Well. I ordered the Scottsdale burrito, and subbed cheddar for the goat cheese. Instead, it came with no cheese. The menu promised hash browns inside the burrito...and they were, and they were frozen shreds with no crisp or color to them. They blended in with the egg whites. Dammit.  Boyfriend ordered the Odelay scramble, with a microscopic amount of chorizo. His side of breakfast potatoes was tasty, at least. Why couldn't they put THOSE potatoes in the burrito? Everything was just underwhelming.   The place has a gigantic breakfast and lunch menu...maybe scale back and focus on making a smaller amount of items, but doing them REALLY well? We both agreed we'd give them one more shot if we're in the area and only if there isn't a wait. Otherwise, there are just too many solid breakfast places in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I think I have this place figured out.  It's the Hooters of the Scottsdale breakfast scene.  Except that at Hooters, the waitresses will at least pretend to like you and crack a smile now and again.  Except at Hooters, the hostess won't say no to you with an attitude.  The food was, while generous in portion, was served close to thirty minutes after our order and was a bit cool when it came out.  Oh whelps."}
{"text":"Extensive menu with healthy selections.  Came in with á party of 7 and was seated immediately even though restaurant appeared very busy.  Food was tasty and great portions and reasonably priced for location.  Only negative:  most of us were coffee drinkers and would like to have had a pitcher of it left at the table as it was hard for the waitress to keep up with our consumption.  Will def be a favorite of ours.  *Dog friendly patio* ++"}
{"text":"It was my first time dining at this lovely restaurant and I have to say I was very impressed. The service was very attentive and friendly and our food was even better! The place is kept very clean and the decor is very trendy and modern. I recommend the mimosa flight to share with someone. It makes your brunch that much better. Keep up the amazing work!! We will be back for another great brunch."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with this place! It was very loud and rather expensive. I was no impressed by the taste of the food nor the service I received. Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"The brisk morning breeze was pretty pleasant today Morning Squeeze was very busy Upon arrival we were told that the patio seats were the only ones available and we didn't mind because they had outdoor heaters The hostesses were friendly and energetic Our server directed to us to our seats I had to have a coffee because it was pretty chilly and I was still half asleep The people in the restaurant all seemed to be hungover/still drinking  I got the Scottsdale burrito and switched out the turkey for sausage It was really good  We were satisfied with our visit and will be back in the future"}
{"text":"Morning Squeeze has my favorite breakfast burrito in town.  It is huge, loaded with good stuff, and delicious!  That is the only thing I've had there, so I can't comment on any of the other food, but when I've been with friends, they have always been happy with their food as well.  Unfortunately, I don't make it there very often because it's always so crowded on weekends--a testament to how good it is.  I have been a couple of weekday mornings, though, and my complaint was the same each time-- initially poor service.  Both times, I was seated and then waited at least 10 minutes for a server to come to the table.  I must point out that this was not during high-traffic times, so they couldn't even use being busy as an excuse.  The last time, my boyfriend actually went to the bar to get waters after we'd been sitting for so long, and it was only then that a server noticed and came to our table.  The good news is that, for the rest of the meal, she was pretty attentive."}
{"text":"One star is being generous. I was told 15-20 minute wait for a table of four. 25 minutes came and went and I saw that they sat 2 tables of 2. People came and went whom arrived after me and were sat before me. I went to check the time and I was told another 25 minutes due to the kitchen being backed up. I understand what it means to be backed up but that is truly poor management and poor planning. My advice... If your kitchen is backed up stop sitting people. I had relatives in town who had time restriction, needless to say nobody got to eat. Very rude staff! I will never eat there again. Poor planning!"}
{"text":"Nice little brunch joint with outdoor seating and even a small dog menu for outside. The service was great and lots of delicious sounding options. Everything was fresh and well put together. I would go back"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, to be able to enjoy a nice Sunday breakfast and some drinks during the morning at the same time. Yes I said drinks! It's like Vegas!   I came here after a long weekend of enjoying a Phoenix Yelp Singles event at Wild Knight. After that night of open bar I was feeling pretty drained however my friend was like hey let's cure that hangover with a drink and this was the place he picked.  It was a great and lively place, there was a line, so I knew it had to be great. We were seated outside where you can watch the cars drive by and enjoy the scenery of Scottsdale. There were lots nice cars parked out too like an Audi R8! Alright moving on to the food, I got a simple, 2 eggs, hashbrown, bacon with fresh fruits. Surprisingly it was pretty feeling and fresh. Everything was cooked fresh and didn't have that old oil/grill taste. The fruit looked colorful and fresh as well. Along with that I had a whole french press coffee to myself and that too was amazing. I don't really see much places serving French Press Coffee nowadays. I usually just make it myself at home! It was a great place to just talk, relax, and bring my weekend to an end. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend. Give it a try, it's a great Sunday morning Breakfast/Drink location!"}
{"text":"there are a lot of haters on this wall and i don't get it. been here several times and really like a lot here.  most recently tho i had the hibiscus orange juice....  BAM BAM BING POW POP BOP BANG BANG BAM BOOM BING BING POW BOP BOP BOP  excuse me, my robot self was just malfunctioning because that juice is fire. str8 fire. short circuit the system.  anyways, the pulled pork Benedict is especially good when you are still drunk from the night before and sunglasses/advil are not adequate enough to mask your misery."}
{"text":"I would go back, but I would order something different. The atmosphere is super cute and the staff is friendly and helpful. The menu had a variety of amazing choices and it took all five of us a while to make a decision. Sadly, I made the wrong decision. I ordered the chocolate chip pancakes thinking they would have the chocolate chips stirred into the batter and evenly distributed throughout the entire fluffy pancake. I was wrong. My extra $1.50 for the chocolate chips only got me a 10-12 clump of chips smack dab in the middle of the giant pancake. That means most bites were just plain, boring, dry pancake. It was very sad for a chocolate chip pancake lover like myself. My sister said her build your own sandwich was delicious and my bacon was cooked to perfection. However, the entire menu was a little over priced. Most of us stuck to water because the juice prices were outrageous."}
{"text":"After a great hike on Camelback on a windy Sunday, me and the roomie decided to grab brunch here.  First thing i ordered was a bloody mary because i saw someone with one (monkey see monkey do) and the bacon sticking out of it looked great!  So when i finally got mine, it had no bacon.. no celery either.. just an olive, a lime, and a lemon.. and it was super bright red.  The taste was not too bad, but definitely not what i had expected, i asked about it, and the server said i should have ordered a \"bacon bloody mary\" . oh well, my bad right?  So i did so for my second, and it was pretty good, except the bacon was old, like what you would find at the last 10 minutes of a bloody mary bar.   To eat, i ordered the chicken fried steak/hashbrowns/something stack, it sounded EPIC! like something from Hash House A GO GO!! But.. when it came, it was lacking, well.. everything, it looked sloppily put together, and was near flavorless.  I am so glad that they had a couple different hot sauces at every table, they are gonna need it."}
{"text":"i would literally NEVER go back here.   i called ahead 45 minutes before we went in because we had a group of 10 people and they told us they had a table for us that would be ready around the time we arrived. long story short, we ended up waiting for another hour outside after we arrived. only 3-4 of the tables in the whole restaurant can be moved around so there was only one place we could sit.  finally we get sat, and the waitress ignores us for over 15 minutes - no water, menus, silverware, nothing. i had to grab a waitress passing by to ask her to grab our girl. she was super panicked and flustered and told us that she was our waitress \"but i just got sat a whole bunch of tables right now, so you guys will have to wait\". when she finally made it back to us, we said we were ready to order and her response had us in tears - she basically looked at us like we were crazy for wanting to order because they had 3 chefs call in that day and the wait for food was going to be another 45 minutes.  anyway, we spent most of the meal going up to the bar to get our own drinks and laughing about how we would never come back."}
{"text":"Always love coming here! I agree with another review, not sure why the reviews aren't higher. We always have a great experience. Today is Memorial Day, so the wait was a little longer and it's been a while to receive our food (still haven't as I write this) but I noticed the main guy we see walkin around.. I think he's the manager? He isn't here today.. It's a girl this time. Haven't seen her check on tables or anything like he does. But he always came to our table to say hi, check up and gave us free drinks before because the wait. Awesome guy! We definitely always come back!"}
{"text":"We tried a new place and it was awesome... Great food, service and dog friendly on the patio. A must try!!"}
{"text":"The food is great here and the location is awesome. The only down fall is if you order anything from the bar the service is extremely slow!"}
{"text":"This place is my go to weekend breakfast spot!  It can get busy but it has a upbeat busy atmosphere that helps me start my day.  Go to menu items- Breakfast sandwich Crepes  Muffins Yogurt granola bowl (ask for honey on the side)  They also have a super powerful cold brew in a bottle or cup."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast place near the Scottsdale shopping and old town. I drove past here on a Saturday and it was packed so we came back on a Monday and it was easy to get in and seated. Food was good and the service was friendly. I ordered the corn beef hash and it was good, portion was a bit small and it was heavy on the potatoes but it was tasty. Overall a nice family breakfast place."}
{"text":"Service was slow but food and coffee was great. Definitely a must for a Sunday morning brunch!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot!  We went on a Sunday morning, so obviously the place was packed, but we still got a table for 4 in less than 30 minutes.  The waitstaff was amazing and took great care of my two little cousins (1 and 4).  The food was really good (I had the chorizo breakfast tacos), but it came out a bit cold which is my only gripe about the place.   The atmosphere is pretty unique, almost like a retro diner with modern touches.  Very bright and upbeat.  And the crowd was a good mix of families and groups of friends eating and drinking away the effects of the previous evening's activities.  I'll definitely try it out again."}
{"text":"We went for the Arizona Breakfast Weekend special.  It went rather well.  The special was 3 tacos made with 4 eggs and your choice of meat in them.  Also included in the $7 special was a mimosa, a bloody mary or a large latte.   The server was nice, checked in with us several times and all went well.   The tacos were hefty enough, that we got full after two!  Took home the last ones so we can scramble them up for lunch.   Easy to find and we were grateful to them for the $7 special, compared to most other restaurants offering only a $15 special."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant for being convenient, when I come to Scottsdale which is often. I sense there is good management with an interest in the business. The food is very good, my only complaint it last week the food was cold and took awhile to come out, given it was only 7.45 am on a weekday and very few customers, I'm not sure why. I will go back again ! Give it a try its fresh and an interesting menu choices something for everyone. Also dog friendly !"}
{"text":"Pretty good place in Oldtown to have a nice breakfast. Food was pretty good, bloody mary with bacon was great. The place gives off a nice vibe."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cali Benedict and added chicken. Both were very plain as were the potatoes. The hashbrown was good. I tried one of the omelettes and it was just ok. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We were helped by Laura who is absolutely awesome! She was friendly and prompt and we couldn't have asked for a better waitress! The food is great and who doesn't want a drink with breakfast sometimes? Laura made a great mimosa too :)"}
{"text":"This place exudes trendiness in all aspects. Awesome interior design, grass on the wall, vibrant colors and very cozy feel.   The wait is a little much usually but we called ahead and that was a fantastic option as we walked in, and sat down, Sunday at 10am.   The noise level is on par with a medium crowd concert and the employees are quite all over the place trying to get everything to wherever it's going. Much like a bustling ant hill.  The servers are very personable and if you can have some patience you'll get what you need. They definitely care about helping you, however if you don't have a patience cap, go somewhere else.  We sat in a booth next to the kitchen and you could definitely see a ton of the breakfast tacos going out, which I would likely get next time. I opted to get the creme brûlée pancakes, which were... Good, however they lacked anything other than pancakes. I felt they were missing something, like you know- another taste of flavor of some sort. Was sort of bored and only ate half of it.  If it weren't for our sweet waitress Briana, being, sweet.. I would've rated the experience even lower however she made the wait, extreme noise level and the marginal food acceptable."}
{"text":"I tried this place recently, I wasn't very impressed with the food, I think the menu was confusing the meals were scattered everywhere and it was so annoying how I had to flip it back and forth a million time with how big it was to figure out what I wanted to get, it  could use so much improvement, I tried the buttermilk waffles and if it wasn't for the fruits I added and the syrup I would probably have tasted nothing, my friend ordered the broccoli grilled cheese,I tried 3 bites of it and I didn't want to eat any more I could have made a better one at home honestly, my sister ordered the cross fit and her toast was burnt and the eggs tasted plain, but the place is pretty....  And the patio is really relaxing,the service was ehh."}
{"text":"After a walk to old town, we decided (based on the crowd) that morning squeeze had it goin on. The wait was only about 15 mins, and we got to sit on the open air patio in the beautiful AZ weather.  We actually got a table quicker by asking for a table outside. We started off with a classic bloody, and it was good. We also got an iced mango chai tea which was the winner of the day. Briana was really good, but the food took a long while to come out (not her fault). The presentation of the dishes was completely lacking. One soup of the day (clam chowder) and half BLT, and it tasted okay. The Crab Bennie was also ordered with country potatoes and it was also just okay. Nothing spectacular here. However, the biscuits and gravy were awful. There is a distinct taste to them, that may be for some,  but we could not even eat one half of a biscuit (and we LOVE biscuits and gravy). Briana was nice enough to take it off the bill for us. Overall, not worth the 40 dollars plus tip to eat breakfast for 2... Would consider ordering some different dishes, as we unfortunately struck out on all 3. Would also say, the atmosphere is great for brunch drinks!"}
{"text":"Yes I agree... 3 stars is the best I can give this restaurant. Had the chicken club, there was plenty of it but it just lacked that wow I'm coming back for another one. I must say the booths were nicely upholstered with rolled and tucked material. They also were fairly comfortable. I'm a table and chair person myself. In my view, with the number of restaurants in this area I would try a different one next time.."}
{"text":"How could this place only have 3 stars? I love this place. It's my go to with better food, service and atmosphere than the other breakfast places in Old Town. Try the Benny and the Jetsetter. And the coffee is awesome. $6 for an OJ is a bit over the top though."}
{"text":"Had a great first experience at Morning Squeeze on this beautiful rainy Sunday morning. Food was great, service was friendly and speedy, couldn't be more satisfied. Enjoyed a delicious vegetarian omelet with a side of crispy toast and a an amazing eggs Benedict. Our waitress, Briana, was very friendly and helpful too. We'll be back for sure. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The food was good, although I'm not sure it's worth the usual 20-40 minute waits on a busy Saturday or Sunday morning. I had the \"Thigh Master\", I think? Grilled Chicken with Spinach, Tomato and Egg White. Although I had it with scrambled eggs. I like that they have a good selection of coffee drinks as opposed to just having plain old boring coffee with cream. Service was fine, no complaints and it was busy, so I don't expect above and beyond for brunches. I'll definitely be back, but probably when I don't mind waiting around for a little bit first."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today and I am disappointed. I ordered the crepe after the waitress recommended it. When it arrived I was sad, it was so small and the presentation was poor. I could have eaten 2 crepes and still not be \"stuffed\" . It was $7.25 for just the crepe without anything in it then another $1.50 or more for each added topping... just wasn't worth the money. There were gnats flying into my water and food the entire time, not in a rush to come back here sadly."}
{"text":"So happy to see this place has very average reviews.  I went today and did not enjoy one thing.  I hate when I come home to review a place tho, and see that everyone else liked it.  Then I have to wonder, is it me?  Am I too particular?  Anyway, judging by many other reviews, it is not just me.  I ordered a very basic bacon and eggs with white toast.  My friend ordered a plain waffle.  Waffle was cold.  Twice.  Butter didn't even melt on it.  There was one tiny dish of syrup, that barely covered half the waffle.  My bacon was undercooked, sunnyside up eggs were broken and the toast was whole wheat, when I ordered white.  And they only serve one slice.  Who doesn't serve 2 slices of toast with breakfast?  Wait, this gets comical.  So I asked her for white toast.  No problem.  She brings back white toast.  Then I see it's not buttered.  I then asked for buttered white toast.  Then she says I'll bring you some butter, as we only serve dry toast here.  If that's the case, then shouldn't they say something in advance?  Not everyone eats dry toast.  I said then the toast will be cold, socan you please make me fresh, hot toast and butter it in the kitchen?  She said they only have a butter oil liquid mix, so I'd probably not want that, but that she would bring me hot toast with butter on the side.  I said fine.  That order comes burnt with rock hard butter on the side.  I said can I please have white toast that is not burnt with butter that isn't hard like a rock, so I could spread it.  She said sure, she will try again.  So I get white toast, at last, not burnt, not buttered, but now with melted butter on the side.  Really.  A dish of totally melted butter.   Anyway, needless to say it took 4 times to get the toast order correct, and even then, it was served with liquid butter.  Pathetic.  If you can't fry an egg and not break it, and you can't serve hot, buttered toast, how can you claim to be a breakfast restaurant?  And who ever said this place is reasonable must come from New York or Paris, because I found them overpriced.  $2.75 for a cup of coffee.  $8 for a smoothie.  $12 for most egg dishes.  This might have become the norm at these overrated, trendy restaurants, but it's definitely not reasonable in my world.  BUT, even at half the price, I would not return."}
{"text":"I work across the street and have been coming here since they flipped Delice into Morning Squeeze. The renovation worked wonders- it's soooo much better than it was.  They're working through staff finding people that fit right and let me tell you, Brandon is absolutely wonderful. If you're looking for a laid back gem in the middle of downtown Tempe, pop over to Morning Squeeze. :)"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open and was so excited when it finally did. I just got my first chance to go yesterday. It wasn't as good as I was hoping for. Our waitress seemed like she wanted to be anywhere but there and was impossible to find most of the time. Two people at our group ordered coffee and she never came around to give them a refill. The food was ok but I honestly could have made the same stuff at my house and I'm not even a great cook. I'm not totally writting them off...I know they just opened so I'm hoping that they will work out the kinks. I'll probably try them again in a couple months...I won't be rushing back next weekend!"}
{"text":"Top marks ! Love the amazing food, don't let the reviews bother you though I am guilty as all others by avoiding places lower than 4 stars like the plague... This place certainly does not deserve the leprosy treatment .  The staff are friendly (to be fair I was one of like 15 people at the restaurant) and the moral of this story might very well be to not expect great service when it's a full house anywhere .   Will highly recommend their biscuits and gravy !"}
{"text":"cold, stale bread is NOT toast. It was a family visit and it was not good. We got a table quickly (1 star). The staff who helped us changed constantly. It was very confusing. The toast was truly just cold, stale bread. Listen, kids, if you are going to try to be clever at least draw some marks on it so it LOOKS like it was toasted. Sigh.  My hangover bowl was tasteless. No black beans in it lame. The cheese was not even melted on top, it was still cold, what the hell!? I put probably half the container of black pepper on it. We were never asked if we wanted anything besides water or how our food was.  It was insanely loud and hard to speak to others at table. When we were ready to leave, we had to flag down some random staff member and it took a while to get it paid. Ridiculous.  If you MUST go to old town for food, just go up a block to that other place on the Westside of Scottsdale road. Anywhere else will do, honestly."}
{"text":"Such a cute \"Old Towny\" breakfast spot with a great layout, helpful staff, and food that hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Healthy food option, just a little overpriced. The staffing is upbeat and enthusiastic. The place is super cute. Great place to stop to have breakfast if you're driving through."}
{"text":"Love the original french toast here. Great menu with lots of unique healthy items. My new fav. for breakfast in old town scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I don't understand the negative reviews at all. It's quite a popular place, which explains the wait time. It was slightly above average wait time for what I'm used to, but again, popular place and most people order drinks and food. Really popular bar.  Ordered the acai bowl (damn) and a beverage. Both really good. So many awesome options - I wanna go back and try again! The portions an get you really full and are great to share! : )"}
{"text":"This place is on it food was great service was great location is awesome at that ham and cheese omelet with avocados. The view is even nicer"}
{"text":"I have had nothing but great experiences at morning squeeze.  The wait can be long on the weekends, but thats expected for anywhere in Old Town.  The food is good, the portions are perfect, and the service is always good.  No complaints here.  It can be pricey, but that's also expected for any place in Old Town.  This is my go-to breakfast spot in the Old Town area.  Skip RnR and The Breakfast club and go to Morning Squeeze."}
{"text":"Super cute and nice ambience - but the food took forever.   Over 45 minutes and no food.... As I'm writing this review, the food is still not here.   Servers made no offer of muffins or anything to acknowledge and pacify the lengthy wait.      We absolutely won't be back, or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The place is designed really nice and has great outdoor seating, but the food really wasn't that great. I ordered an omelet that was missing avocado, came with a side of potatoes which looked like they had been fried for hours and I wasn't sure they were even potatoes anymore. Toast was cold and eggs were cold. The only good thing that was actually pretty good were the protein pancakes."}
{"text":"I am disappointed with this new place. I love breakfast so I have tried a lot of places and I am a regular of 1 butterfields, 2 daily dose and 3 breakfast club ( quality of food in that order as well ).   Pros:  + the server was super nice and it made the   experience bearable as well as the bussers that refill the coffee  + coffee is good better than daily dose + interior looks good - nice design  That's about it.   Cons: + it took 30minutes for our food to arrive ( and it's just scrambled egg with spinach) , bacon and hash browns + egg was overcooked  + food was cold + 3 pcs of bacon is not good  Will not recommend"}
{"text":"Love this great new brunch place in Old Town.  This is a tiny place but they can sure squeeze a lot of people in.  I recently checked out this place with a friend on a Sunday.  The place was busy with tables but we choose to sit on the patio.  With the hot Arizona heat, it was too bad sitting at the bar.  I would recommend installing some misters.  The service was very good.  We got our Hibiscus Mimosa and Iced coffee within in minutes of sitting down.  I went healthy for breakfast and tried the Squeeze Scramble.  The scramble includes turkey sausage, egg whites, mushrooms and onions.  I added country potatoes and an English muffin to the meal.  My friend tried the Grilled Cheese with truffle fries.  The truffle fries were amazing.    I have no complaints with my visit at the Morning Squeeze and I hope to make many more visits.  They have an extensive menu and I had a hard time making a decision on breakfast.  I wish they would be open for dinner.  I love having breakfast for dinner."}
{"text":"Sunday mornings, there's always a wait to dine here.  People like to look their best for brunch in Scottsdale so you may want to rethink those comfy sweat pants.  There is a large selection of breakfast and lunch items on the menu.  I personally like to order anything that involves eggs benedict. I would not be able replicate theirs at home.  The pricing is ok for the amount of food you get. When a meal says it comes with a side of fruit, they really mean one tiny slice. I am usually still hungry at the end of my meal.  But, I mostly come here for the experience, the atmosphere, and to people watch. Then I go home and eat a little more."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite breakfast place. I love the food, the ambience, the decor and it's usually not that long of wait. Iced lattes and the Mexican breakfast burrito are sooooo delicious. It's also good for people watching on Sundays."}
{"text":"Don't go here if all you have is an hour for lunch. The service is really horrible. Not only do the servers take forever to greet you, but they take forever to bring your drink and they'll leave the food under the heater for 10 minutes before they bring it to you.....all while the place isn't even busy...I've been here a few times in the past 4 years because I work close by.  I swear every time I decide to give it another try, I get a similar experience.  It usually has to do with the servers they hire. I don't know if they all have zero IQ's or what, but I swear there is nothing going on upstairs in a few of those girls minds. The most recent time I gave this place a shot I ordered a sandwich on gluten free bread. The server let the food sit under the heater for 10 minutes before bringing it over with a regular bun on it. When I asked for the gluten free bread again she just said \"oh\". Fast forward another 15 minutes, still no bread....she came to check on us and meanwhile I'm not able to eat my meal. We complained to the manager who was nice to comp the meal. Unfortunately, this place needs to get it together."}
{"text":"We became addicted after our first visit, so returned 3 days in a row.  After checking out our free hotel breakfast, we ran to our car and drove the couple of minutes to Squeeze and never looked back.  Great coffee & cappuccinos.  Order the breakfast tacos (3 in a tray will fill you up), blueberry or wheat & nuts pancakes - yumm.  Good OJ, too.  Loved the color scheme, so bright and refreshing and after a good cup of their coffee helped me wake up to a great day.  And the servers - we had a different server each day but each one was friendly, knew the menu and helpful.  I'm missing you, Morning Squeeze, already.  See you next year while at Spring Training - Go Giants!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I've had nothing but good food here, and FYI they even have a doggy menu:) . However, the first time my friends and I dined here, our inexperienced but gorgeous server forgot some parts of our order and never checked on us. It's really important to check back with the guest after food is dropped. My friends and I ofcourse came back and were able to enjoy our meal because we had everything we ordered, and the service was ofcourse awesome. I wish I could remember her name, because she was stellar!  We would continue to come in, but service was always inconsistent, and we didn't want to juggle with it...BUT things MUST be changing because... This morning, I called and ordered a bagel breakfast sandwich to go because our office is very close by and because they seemed so busy, I waited to pick it up, not to mentioned called 3x to place the order. I walked in and the very bubbly manager, Gino, was surprised I took so long to pick it up...He explained that the place was under new management- after he understood my frustration. Not only that, but they were shorthanded, and Gino was totally efficient. Today when I walked in, not only did he approach me right at the door - but the bartender was on top of it too- asking if I had placed a to go order! Im really happy about this because before, I'd walk in...stand around the hostess podium....while the staff stands by the server station and the only one who approached me was clueless about the order... .I know I seem harsh, but I too have been in the industry- and this place has so much potential! I've always been proud or priviledged to work at certain places, like Olive and Ivy and The keg etc. People dine out for the experience...Not just convienience. It's nice to go out and have a server that is full of energy, knows the menu, and cares about the guest. I think Gino will do great job...and when you go in, sit AT the BAR....The day time bartender is on top of her game!!! I would still give the servers a chance too:) The patio is dog friendly and the inside is comfortable...This review is mainly all compliment because today I was really impressed and even as short as the interaction was...it really showed that the new management cares:) Good job Squeezers..."}
{"text":"The staff here is great super friendly. The food is good but may take forever to come out! I clocked my friend and My food at 45 minutes... Luckily we had stuff to talk about to keep us busy."}
{"text":"DON'T EAT HERE!!   Burnt food..... Four times in a row? I'm the dumb one for giving this place too many chances. We even asked not to burn the food today and apparently they heard BURN IT MORE! :( I spoke with the manager Leslie today and she didn't have any excuse except to say \"we are really trying\". And we had a coupon that said buy one get one free, after 11:30, and the hostess said it was only good at night... BUT THE PLACE CLOSES AT 3.   This place is just run by a bunch of clowns. I will never eat here again, and you shouldn't either!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst breakfast place I've been to.  So to start off it took like 10 minutes for the server to come to our table with water.  She was pleasant, which was probably the only good part of this place.  Other employees weren't so friendly.  However, the food was definitely what urged me to write this review.  I'm one of the least picky eaters, but this food was unpalatable.  Both my friend and I had unpalatable dishes.  Bread was hard but not toasted, eggs were soggy, potatoes were old.  Everything just tasted bland as well.  Took maybe 4 bites of my food and then asked for the check.  I'm not one to complain or argue so I didn't tell her it was disgusting.  But I feel like she should've asked what was wrong since we both ate so little.  Paid the bill, tipped accordingly since at least she was nice, and left.  I understand this place is new but it could've been so much better."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for brunch. Tastey, fresh mimosa's and eggs benedict made to perfection. It is obviously a popular establishment as it is fully booked every time I have been there!"}
{"text":"Morning Squeeze is one of two place we eat every time we're in the Phoenix area! The service is great and the food is excellent. Great ambience! Get there early or be prepared for a long wait!"}
{"text":"Early Saturday morning breakfast and couldn't decide on what to get off if the huge menu.  Our waitress, Karissa, offered her favorites and we went with her suggestions:  breakfast tacos with sausage and the billy bob Bennie.  Tacos came out with link rather than pattie as ordered....karissa offered to exchange, no big deal.   The Bennie was good, but the the hash browns could have been warmer.  Coffee was hot and strong.  Not a solid 4 stars, but better than three...more attention to detail and this place can be the best breakfast spot in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We recently went to the morning squeeze on this past Monday April 18 at around 12:46 in the afternoon. We had visitors from Virginia and spoke very highly of our past experiences there to  our guest.   Unfortunately, we were very embarrassed by the service and how cold our entrees were when we finally received them at our table. I ordered their famous biscuits and gravy which came out cold 2 times. We still left a 20% gratuity in kindness but we're heavily considering not returning."}
{"text":"Service was sub par at best. Food delivered with no plate setting. Coffee served with no cream or sugar offered. No refill offered. Toast served cold and dry. Asked for butter and jam. Butter was harder than Chinese algebra so it didn't spread well to say the least."}
{"text":"Oh Morning Squeeze...I used to love you, but today we are ending our long term relationship. Yes, it's super cute decor and trendy looking waitstaff, dog friendly patio and fresh and healthy options are all great- I just can't return after the multiple times of sorely lacking and unprofessional service we have encountered. I can take a lot of abuse as a patron and not complain. Yes I will scrape off the cheese I didn't ask for or overlook a slightly burned pancake but today we politely sat for over 30 minutes while 2 parties that order after us received their food. After 5 more minutes we informed our server- and she corrected us first, claiming we ordered after them, then checked her station and realized we were right. Even after going back to the kitchen we waited about another 10 minutes. When we received our food my partner's chicken was so burnt he could not even cut it with a knife. We begrudgingly sent it back as we were starving - we waited over 10 minutes for a replacement and the manager was informed but never stopped by to check on us.  Unfortunately this was the second time I had to send something back here (and only the 3rd time ever in my life!). On my previous visit my chicken sandwich was undercooked and the same manager did do the right thing and got it re made and back to me and came to check up and apologize. That is why I decided to return but unfortunately we were rewarded with being ignored by our server, given burnt chicken then having to wait an inordinate amount of time for a replacement and not getting a follow up with the manager.   Sorry guys but until you have some management changes we are threw."}
{"text":"Food, ambiance, and service (once we were sat) were all awesome! I had steak and eggs which was huge,  but delicious! Also, they have a bottle of champagne for $20 &add OJ for make-own-mimosas at the table..beautiful patio area for bringing dogs and enjoying AZ weather.  Only bummer was arrival experience into restaurant. They weren't on any wait with many tables open and hostess left us outside for up to 10 mins after not-so-welcome greeting. Otherwise, i reccomend grabbing your pooch and heading on down!"}
{"text":"Good service and good breakfast. I shared the steak and eggs with my wife. The coffee  is really bad...but who can beat Starbucks?.. maybe they should just get there coffee from starbucks :)"}
{"text":"First time here. Great service by Briana! Such a sweetheart and very personable!  Food/flavor was as expected;I got the breakfast tacos. Did not 'WOW' me. Coffee was not the best...   Loud environment when busy! All in all, it was a normal experience."}
{"text":"Yelpers: I am glad I chose to stop here for a late breakfast. I did not witness any of the hiccups some of the previous entries did. The staff was friendly, young and respectful, food was above average. I had the egg white omelette feta, spinach, tomatoes, & hash browns which were very tasty and just the right portions. In and out in 30 ish minutes at 1215. Plus it's fun to sit on the sidewalk and enjoy.  I will recommend The Squeeze to anyone I know that visits this area."}
{"text":"Favorite dog friendly place in Scottsdale! We seriously go here every Saturday morning. Every employee is a friendly face and the bartenders are total sweethearts! Their Greek omelette is to die for and their protein pancakes are delicious as well! If you want to be naughty get the crepe with banana and PB chips SO YUM!!! Overall an amazing breakfast spot for the old town area!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I checked out Morning Squeeze for the first time this weekend. We somehow got a table right away, located outside on the main patio. I ordered the Eggs My Way and a Mimosa; my boyfriend got the Belgian Waffle. Both dishes were great! Their menu is really big and I would totally come back to try a few other things, as I bet they have over 30 breakfast items to choose from. It was a busy morning at Morning Squeeze and our waitress was attentive. Fun atmosphere and good place for people watching!"}
{"text":"Loved the vivacious atmosphere! Service was quick and very friendly.  My breakfast burrito was filling, however the beans were a bit crunchy (shouldn't it be a little soft?) but altogether it was good!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Right in the heart of old town scottsdale on scottsdale rd. So it's great to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful weather and scenery of old town. The waitresses are all very easy on the eyes. I usually go with the French toast and a mimosa or the omelette. Never been disappointed in any trip down there. Open 7 days a week so it's good spot any day."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were going out for breakfast and decided to give this place a try. I'm very glad we did. The place is bright, clean, and the staff are very friendly. The menu is filled with an abundance of well put together items that are perfect for those trying to eat healthy. Eggs generally don't sit well with me, plus I'm diabetic, so I ordered a tuna salad. I was informed lunch items didn't get served till 11:00. It was 10:00. I explained my issues and asked if she would Ask if they could do this for me, which they were willing to do. I really appreciate a places willingness to put customers above what time it is. This was a large reason for my five stars. Another reason for 5 stars was the food itself. My salad was fresh, crisp, lightly dressed, and the tuna was also lightly dressed so you tasted tuna. So many times at other places I feel like asking if I could have some tuna with my mayo. But not here. There was a hint of Tarragon that was a pleasant surprise as well. My daughter had an egg white omelet with spinach and other healthy ingredients. It looked beautiful and she enjoyed it very much. She had to take half of it home. You really get plenty of food. We saw someone served a breakfast burrito that looked big enough for 3-4 people. Fresh squeezed OJ and good coffee makes this place worthy of my coming back and encouraging others to check this place out."}
{"text":"I had a friend tell me how great this breakfast place was so I decided to try it. He always got the Harveys oatmeal and raved about it so last Sunday, I decided to try it. I got there about 1145a and sat at the bar. I ordered the Harvey's oatmeal. I had asked for the fruit and nuts to be on the side and it was. Unfortunately though, the oatmeal cold and it wasn't even served with milk. That was disappointing and I figured the whole pot must be that way in the kitchen so I ordered eggs Benedict, California style with veggies. I now have waited quite a while. The Benedict showed up and sure enough, it too was luke warm and so were the hash browns! It was also soggy. Are you kidding me? What are they doing in the kitchen? The man next to me told me he comes there a lot but had a bad Sunday experience himself with cold food. The server behind the bar was very apologetic, twice, and then a manager came and apologized. She did not charge me of course, and was nice enough to give me a gift card to return. I think I will give it to my friend and return to my favorite breakfast place, Breakfast Kitchen Bar in the Scottsdale Quarter. Food made from scratch, not prepackaged and a unique menu.  Everything I've ever had there is excellent!"}
{"text":"How many more chances do you give a highly popular restaurant to get it right after repeated examples of bad service and poor food product? None! After too many mornings to count where we were forced to send back a \"toasted English muffin\" because it arrived cold and raw - how is it I asked for a \"warmed\" blueberry muffin and I see it cut in half, toasted and burnt to a crisp? WTF?  What was once a new and interesting place to hang out and people watch has become a victim of their own success.  How many times can you express your disappointment and the only response is to \"comp\" the item. Today I was told - \"I understand why that seems bad\".  I understand too, it's because IT IS BAD! No longer will I not critique  the servers who arrive Saturday and Sunday morning hung over and huddled in the corner reviewing the events of the prior night while coffee cups sit empty and orders sit on the kitchen window getting cold.   When food product arrives with shards of melted plastic in it because someone dropped a spatulate on the grill \"by mistake\" and when this is all served up with a - we just don't care - attitude on the side.  Well, I do care and I am done and I hope all those other regulars and those reading this and looking for a new option do the same. Perhaps it is time to seek out a new option and new place, one actually worth it."}
{"text":"Everything is good about this place. And by good, I mean nothing is impressive but nothing is terrible. Bloody Mary's and Mimosas are pretty decent, but overall, this wouldn't be on my list of recommended breakfast joints in the area."}
{"text":"So we called in from the office to pick up breakfast to go, took a bit longer than expected though but I was like \"no worries, at least it will be fresh\". Some of the food was cold though. But that's the chance you take when you order to go! What really bothered me though is I had asked them for jelly for my toast on my to go order, and they remembered the jelly but forgot the toast. Not bad, but not what I was hoping for"}
{"text":"Really like this place, I've come twice now, and the atmosphere is great, service is great, and the food is great, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Delish food, friendly service and good vibe! Location is convenient in heart of scottsdale, the food comes out fresh and quick, and prices are affordable. Consistently good every time. For breakfast, I like the breakfast tacos and a smoothie. Also enjoy their Finest Hash and Pulled Pork Bennie."}
{"text":"I can definitely understand why this place only has 3 stars. Myself and 3 gal pals came for the first time this morning to place to go orders and were really let down by the level of service especially from the manager. I ordered a strawberry smoothie (add banana) and a side of bacon. (I'm 6 months pregnant and have learned not to argue with my cravings) The bacon of course was fine, who messes up bacon? However, the strawberry smoothie was an abomination. It was made from some form of disgustingly sweet pre-mix that has no business being in their restaurant and had not been mixed thoroughly either. I informed the host of my dislike for the smoothie and asked if it could be remade with fruit and ice only. She came back and informed me the only fruit they have is bananas, did I want that. You can't possibly think I believe that there is no fresh fruit anywhere in this restaurant aside from bananas?! And no I sure as hell do not want a banana smoothie.   She said that she would go get a manager for a price adjustment, and did so. The manager (a woman who I did not meet) came out, did something at the register, and then went about her merry way back to the kitchen. What kind of half ass manager doesn't apologize to the customer or even speak at all? My mind is at a loss for how in the world this woman became a manager unless her wait staff has the misfortune of having her as a owner in which case I could understand. Some people buy titles, others earn it. If she earned it I'd be flabbergasted.  We went to the restaurant at 7:45 am on Friday, April 29th. The \"manager\" was a shorter woman with brown wavy/curly hair."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere.  (Best I can say). 5 dishes ordered. Nothing was hot. Release Grayson with over-easy eggs was terrible. Roasted tomatoes were COLD.  Eggs were undercooked so I stopped eating. Watched the kitchen and although they are all trying, they are struggling to get food out in a timely manner and correctly. Things sit forever.  Oh, and my hazelnut latte did not have any hazelnut flavoring.  Tough morning for Morning Squeeze. Edited review to two stars because they accepted the feedback and took responsibility."}
{"text":"Ever wonder why some people NEVER LEARN? Well, I have to look in the mirror and wonder that myself. After my last experience here I'm wondering why I would go back, but I'm a sucker for a memory. I really love the feel of this place. I loved the experiences and food I've had prior to the last few visits but this may be the 3rd strike. I met my AOB buds here for lunch. And, as fate would have it our experience this time was much the same as the last. First, lets start out with a public service announcement to ALL servers who think it's cool to memorize the customers order in your head. IT'S NOT. No one cares if you can remember ANYTHING. That's not why the customer is at your place of employment. They are there to be served. All the customer wants is what they order. CORRECTLY. And when you don't write anything down and the order comes out wrong and then you blame the kitchen the ONLY person who looks like a schmuck is YOU. Do yourself a favor and all of your past and future customers, WRITE ORDERS DOWN.  So, here's how our lunch went. Our server was AM Bar. Yep, forgot her name which is a good thing for her. AM Bar is what it says on the receipt. Regardless, as I ranted above I'm sure it's obvious that she did not write our orders down. We even told her that it would probably be a good idea because our friend S (female) loves to order stuff and then make so many changes it's hardly recognizable as the original food she ordered. But, this server in ALL her wisdom thought she knew better and did NOT write anything down. T ordered the Cali Bennie ($10). He also ordered the Ham Steak Side ($3.95). His Cali Bennie was fine he said, but the Ham Steak never materialized. By the time he was asked how everything was and he pointed out the missing item, he decided that he didn't want it anyway and told our server to forget about it. S (male) ordered the Breakfast Burrito with Red Sauce ($9.75) His burrito came with green sauce and instead of waiting and having them re-fire another, he gave in and just ate the green sauce covered burrito. S said it was tasty but would have been better as ordered, not as delivered. S (female) ordered the Caesar salad ($7) with oil & vinegar instead of Caesar dressing. She also ordered the dressing on the side. She also ordered a side of Deviled Eggs ($3). A pretty good deal for 3 bones you get 3 halves. S commented that they were pretty good. And guess what? Her entire order was correct. I ordered the Build Your Own breakfast sandwich ($6.50). This really is an amazing deal, of course that only applies if they get it right. Which they didn't, AGAIN. And this is where I kind of insisted that she write down the order because there is a lot to remember. But alas, she thought she was being neat or cool or something. In the end, she was just an idiot. I ordered the sandwich with fried egg, chicken, Havarti cheese on wheat bread and added Avocado, Tomato and Onion. My sandwich came with no chicken. No meat of any kind. Seriously? Our server was kind enough to bring me a side of chicken, which ended up being a grilled chicken breast, but I wanted the chicken on the sandwich, not a side plate. Plus, the chicken was DRY. The sandwich itself without the chicken was ok and was half gone by the time the chicken did arrive. I will note that the restaurant took my sandwich off the bill. BAD service, 3 out of 4 mistakes, adequate food, good prices. 1.5 Stars."}
{"text":"So disappointed  I was so excited Morning Squeeze was coming to Tempe but was sadly let down! I live in Tempe and frequent local establishments for breakfast, lunch and happy hour. Customer service was good! Food was terrible! My breakfast was cold, eggs were not cooked right and my order was not complete. Seemed management was overwhelmed and place was not full several empty tables. I would not recommend. Not too hard to get breakfast right!"}
{"text":"The \"Morning Squeeze\" and no fresh squeezed juice?  Huh.  We were promptly sat at a table when we arrived.  We then waited 5+ minutes before we met our waitress.  Our order came out in a decent amount of time but my biscuits and gravy as well as the accompanying scrambled eggs came out cold.  No check in from the waitress to see how the food was until I had picked my way through 1/3 of the cold dish.  I pointed out what had happened and received no apology, just a whole lot of \"and I care why?\" attitude.  She retreated into the back room and returned with a zero bill for my breakfast.  That's nice, but still, no apology.  I could continue to ramble on about the remainder of the bad service we received but I'll spare you from having to read it all.  This place is on our \"do not return\" list."}
{"text":"I had been patiently waiting for this place to open! I was super excited when they did, however a little underwhelmed by some of the reviews. Maybe I had hyped it up in my head too much? But I decided to give it a go anyway.   Went here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon and was immediately sat. We were kind of lucky coming a bit later as it wasn't too busy. The decor is adorable, with bright, spring colors. Unfortunately it was too cold to dine outside, so we were sat indoors. The booths are bright green and quite roomy-I wondered what this place was beforehand? My boyfriend seems to think it used to be a sushi restaurant.    Our server was Lauren, and she was really friendly and helpful with the menu. My boyfriend and I ordered mimosas and coffee, and drinks came relatively quickly.  The menu is rather extensive with both breakfast and lunch choices. I opted to order the Scottsdale Burrito (egg whites, tomato, spinach, goat cheese and hash browns), and my boyfriend ordered the My Eggs My Way. Our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, and was delicious!   Overall, my experience with Morning Squeeze was a good one. Although they just opened, I feel like they are a very promising restaurant. I had realistic expectations that were far exceeded by the excellent service and delicious food. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We were walking towards downtown to do some sign seeing and we passed by this place. It was busy early in the Sunday morning. We had a group of ten and we waited about 15 minutes to get our spot. That's not bad consider how busy they were. They spilt us to two tables though. One on the booth near the wall and the other on the table a little below the booth. It's kind of weird and we didn't really get to talk much together. None of the guys finished their meal cause the potion was big. Well i guess the $20 Mimosa bottle thingy filled them up too. It's kind of hot and stuffy inside the restaurant though so seating outside was probably a better option."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving them 2 stars is because of our previous experience here. The first time I went to the morning squeeze I got the breakfast sandwich with bacon on the side and it was delicious. Bacon was cooked perfectly and the sandwich was an amazing home style recipe. Unfortunately the second visit didn't live up to the hype.   On our second visit, the sandwich was just \"eh\" and the bacon was burnt to a crisp. Being a waitress, why would you even serve a plate of bacon that looks burnt and dry to a customer? I mentioned it to the waitress and she said \"ok I'll get you more.\" She came back with what appeared to be the SAME burnt and dry bacon. It was so hard it was literally inedible.   Hopefully they were just having an off day, or maybe they were training a new cook. (there was a kid who looked 16 in the kitchen)  Either way, if I give them a try again and have the same experience I won't be returning any more."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast place in Scottsdale. (It doesn't hurt that it's right around the corner from the Marriot we always stay in) I love sitting outside and enjoying an iced coffee while waiting for my food. I usually grab the Laguna Beach antioxidant bowl with acai sorbet and a packed assortment of fruit. It's delicious and definitely one of the healthier options available from Morning Squeeze's robust menu choices. I've gone with the pancakes a few times as well and they are nearly impossible to finish. Fabulous though, especially with peanut butter chips :)"}
{"text":"Great brunch and lunch spot. Foods solid, great Bloody Mary's  and the staff is solid.   Very busy on weekends.  NOT a 3 star experience. Closer to 4.5.  Not sure why they're ranked so low."}
{"text":"Food was OK. I ordered their famous oatmeal and a banana nut muffin but wasn't impressed. The bags of Quaker Oat Meal I get at the store is a lot better. Also, the muffin looked and tasted store bought. If I knew I was going to wait 45 minutes to be seated plus an hour to get our food, I would have stayed at home and ate elsewhere. Not good for groups!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. Came here with a party of 10 on a Sunday. Granted, we were a big group, but the service was ridiculous. We didn't get seated for an hour and saw other large groups who came after us get seated. Then, they said they couldn't accommodate us at 1 table and tried to sit us in a booth and table, even though we saw other large groups who were accommodated. We had to ask for that before they put 2 tables together. Then, it took 15 minutes before she even took our order. And as I write this, we have been waiting over 40 minutes for our food. Being from New York, I've been to my share of terrible establishments. But this by far is one of the worst places I've ever been to. I have literally been sitting here watching the restaurant clear out. No excuse for taking this long for service. I can't even comment on the food. But no great dish could turn this around. Terrible representation of Phoenix dining. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Got the Eggs Benedict and mimosa flight (classic, grapefruit, and hibiscus). Great service, tasty food, and delicious drinks! Great brunch spot in North Tempe."}
{"text":"Ordinarily I'm pretty positive when it comes to this sort of thing, but the wait time at this place killed the experience.  After being seated and promptly ordering, I waited more than an hour before being served, with little to no acknowledgment.  Once the food did come out it was lukewarm, and average at best.  Needless to say I will not be returning, and you shouldn't either!!"}
{"text":"How is this place still open? It is the worst!! Can't handle themselves when it's busy. The food quality SUCKS! Bland potatoes and hard boiled poached eggs. Also, found a gross beard hair in our food. The only saving grace is they were too busy to remember to ring up our drinks."}
{"text":"Keep in Mind that two stars = \"meh.\" So it wasn't a bad experience...it just wasn't impressive, or original, or anything super amazing. I probably won't be back because I think I would have appreciated a hardier meal or at least one with more flavor. I had the bananas foster waffle. Service was slow. There's a dog patio so that was nice. The mimosa was small and overpriced.  It was decent. I just don't see myself coming back and I think my partner would say the same. Maybe try Snooze in Tempe for a unique take on breakfast!"}
{"text":"Service good. Music too loud. Food SUCKS! Looks good yet tastes cheep and microwaved! yuck. Won't ever be back"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!  At first we got there and we were seating right away. But then we ordered our food and waited and waited and waited. Had food brought to us that wasn't even ours it was for a table that got there after us. Mind you we have been waiting for 30 mins now. Then we saw 2-3 tables come in eat and leave still had no food. Then finally the waitress came to tell us it was really busy sorry for the wait. So after 50! Minutes we finally got our food and it was ICE COLD!!! I normally never send food back or make a sense but this is just not okay! Then when we told our waitress about the situation she said she would have the manager come over and talk to us we proceeded to wait another 10! Minutes for the manager she NEVER came so we told our waitress that we weren't going to pay and wanted to leave and how this is totally unacceptable (mind you I work in the industry ). Horrible horrible horrible. I don't even want to give one star"}
{"text":"I went to Morning Squeeze for the first time on Sunday, May 15th and had awful experience. Being in the service industry I am not particularly picky, except when it comes to acknowledging guests and wait times. There were many open tables and the wait was 30 minutes. My boyfriend and I sat at the bar to eat instead and we were not acknowledged for ten minutes and we ended up leaving."}
{"text":"Food was ok here. The first round of food I got was really cold, literally cold. First time I have ever sent something back to get the same thing again. It kind of scares me getting food after complaining, but they have an open kitchen. So I really felt ok with doing it this time. The next plate of food was good and hot.  Service is good to average. I sat at the bar with my friend, noticed only female servers and bartenders at the place. It is full of dudes gawking at all of them while ordering breakfast... Almost  creepy. You can tell all the girls here are so used to it they just have these fake smiles and tiring looks on there faces. Anyway they did have baileys and coffee, outside seating, wheat toast.... Which for some reason is rare here in old town Scottsdale. Atmosphere was really nice and modern. They need to work on the food being cold situation, I guess you can't really do anything about all the creeps:) might not come back unless someone else wants to go"}
{"text":"I've been to this place numerous times and it still doesn't \"wow\" me like it did the first time. Staff is slow, the food is just meh, and it's kind of pricey."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary is on point, food is always amazing, great service. Came in this morning was seated immediately, all around great atmosphere. A must breakfast place if you are in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The Morning Squeeze is very laid back and cool atmosphere.  Our waitress was at our table quickly and got our drink order.  We sat outside and the weather in the morning was just fine and the outdoor misters helped :)  When our order arrived...we got the Classic Bennie (Should of got that) and the Jet setter.  It was prepared fine, except my bread was a little burnt..Check the picture out.  The staff was attentive, the food was pretty good and the atmosphere was great.  A good breakfast and the prices are decent as well."}
{"text":"Morning Squeeze 5 stars Breakfast Club 4 Daily Dose 3.75 all in walking distance. Karissa is an excellent waitress which matches the vibe of the Morning Squeeze ask for her. An egg is an egg all places had good food. Daily Dose has a slow roasted pork green chili swiss omelette that was awesome and you can't go wrong at Breakfast Club but if you want to hear a remix of an Elvis song and other cool music then squeeze"}
{"text":"The place is beautifully decorated. The food however tasted like Denny's food. The hash brown tasted old and looked kinda grey. The mimosa flight had way too much champagne in it, some people might like that but not for me."}
{"text":"great variety menu, good food, excellent breakfast drinks.  the atmosphere is perfect for an indoor/outdoor experience.  we come here regularly and like the speed and service from the counter."}
{"text":"Please bring back the Scottsdale Burrito! The jive omelette was bland. Literally smothered it with hot sauce to finish. This is our favorite breakfast joint, but missing the old menu terribly.  UPDATE: got my Scottsdale burrito :)"}
{"text":"Morning Squeeze is a welcome addition to Old Town and is a nice alternative to fit into the weekend breakfast/brunch rotation. I typically opt to bypass the wait for a table and grab a seat at the bar during busy brunch hours and I do enjoy the indoor/outdoor seating options. The outdoor side of the bar was a little toasty throughout the summer, but the indoor side stayed surprisingly cool. Maybe a little crunched if the bar is packed, but not bad.  The food was mediocre - nothing bad or cooked improperly, but nothing drool-inducing. The brussel sprout salad was good, alebit very heavy on dressing which was a touch too sweet for my taste. The omelettes are sizable with good filling choices, but the breakfast potatoes seemed a little...generic. My hubby had a sandwich that was also unremarkable, but the Bloody Mary's were delicious. Their canine menu is cute and I'm glad we have another place that welcomes pups on the side patio.   Overall I like the vibe and the eats are alright. The beverages are tasty and the staff is fairly welcoming (though we've had a couple of inattentive bartenders, no one has been unfriendly). I would recommend this to others and out of towners for a pleaseant meal with a decent price."}
{"text":"4 stars for the location, the high food quality, and the large menu selection. However, in my opinion they need to work on the service which could be better. Ok that it's just breakfast, but the customer always needs to feel welcome.   Anyway, I had a biscuits and gravy plate with eggs, bacon, and potatoes. And a large cappuccino. Simply delicious."}
{"text":"If you are visiting the Scottsdale area, do NOT waste your money here. The host was extremely rude and unhelpful as soon as we entered. We ended up seating ourselves at the outside bar where pretty much all the chairs were open after the host told us there's no room anywhere and we have to wait 25 minutes to be seated. Everyone's food was disgusting. Nothing had flavor but was just covered in pepper. The bartender was rude and paid no attention to us and didn't check on us while she talked to every other person at the bar. Don't waste your money here!"}
{"text":"Morning Squeeze hosting a Yelp event and threw a nice party. Great breakfast joint. A bit spendy but it is more than a greesy spoon. I'll definitely want to try this spot again since the event had a buffet and sometimes those aren't the best way to show off your food. But what I did sample seemed interesting."}
{"text":"So excited to have a breakfast spot near by that we can do brunch! They have mimosa flights, They could be colder but a few ice cubes help! Megan was our server she was very enthusiastic and friendly. I had a build your own breakfast sandwich it was great! The avocado looked to be grilled but i was turned off by that so i didn't eat it. The hubby had the burrito and loved it! The green Chile's were fantastic on it. Over all I'm looking foreword to go back."}
{"text":"Going way downhill. There are notifications all over FB that say buy one get free lunch so...why not? We ordered a chicken waldorf salad and a black and bleu burger with a chicken breast. The chicken in the salad was awesome. In fact, everything in the salad was except for the dressing. It was a yogurt vinaigrette and was...well, pasty? Weird. I asked Amanda, our server to bring some balsamic vinegar and she brought olive oil. Other than that hiccup, our service was fine. We had full drinks and she checked on us frequently. The chicken sandwich was just gross though. Neither of us tasted any cajun on it and it was undercooked. We didnt eat it. When Amanda brought the bill, I said, oh I thought you were doing a BOGO special and she said, \"yeah, If you have the card for it.\" I said to show me where on any of these posts say anything about a card and she couldn't. So, they took off the sandwich we didn't like anyways. I can see this place scratching to stay alive.....sad, considering at one time, this place was so awesome. On a side note, the bartender was so nice, saying hi and bye and he hopes we have a good day etc..."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. Lots of staff running around but no one helps and never saw my waitress. The manager should start helping out and maybe lead by example. See an empty drink fill it."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite breakfast joint until today. Today, they messed up my order completely. I ordered 3 pancakes and bacon to go. I guess it was my fault for putting too much trust in the establishment and not checking the bag. I got 4 slices of burnt French toast, 4 strips of cold bacon and 2 burnt pancakes. All for a total that was higher than what it should have been. I called them to tell them about what happened and they seemed pretty reluctant to give me any sort of compensation. When I went back to get my compensation (not a refund, mind you), they refused to tell me how much was on the card. I had to ask to speak with the hostess' manager. The manager came up and acted like I was asking the world of her to see how much was on the giftcard they gave me. After waiting 10 minutes and finally getting the amount, the manager handed me my giftcard without even the slightest apology. She simply stated \"here.\" Bad customer service."}
{"text":"Nice location and good ambience, open atmosphere. Have only tried a couple breakfast dishes but not bad. Next time I come back I'll have to order something different. I like the booth seating and outdoor seating options. Nice asset to have nearby."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, bloody Mary's are super good! Not badly priced either for what you get in old town Scottsdale and for it not being a weekend day.   Patty melt is amazing, garlic fries need work.  Eggs Benedict are sooooo good.  And the mimosa flight is adorable. I love the hibiscus!   Being a dog owner, this place really does cater to dogs which is amazing to see.   Overall, a good option for brunch and lunch!   And Shaw was great as a server!"}
{"text":"I went here for a business meeting today. I like that it's dog friendly, the food is very delicious, and it's reasonably priced. I like that they can also make protein shakes!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for breakfast, and have always left disappointed. The menu is pretty basic, so I feel as though I'm paying for something I could easily make at home. The coffee always tastes a little burnt, and the last time we visited our server forgot about us for no joke 40 minutes. I don't see myself going back.  If you're looking for a good breakfast/brunch spot definitely opt for Daily Dose down the street."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict was the best I've ever had. Awesome place on Scottsdale Road in Old Town!"}
{"text":"There was a 30 minute line to get in for brunch on a Monday, for good reason.  Very cool, funky interior.  Great prices on food.  Full bar.  Array of choices on menu.  Plentiful servings.  Good waitress service.  Excellent people watching.  This place is on my list to return when I'm back in Scottsdale for Spring Training next year.  Go Giants!"}
{"text":"I had the monte cristo sandwich with fries, very tasty but what made the sandwich complete was the strawberry jelly. This is a very rich sandwich and I would not recommend for someone looking for a light breakfast since it was oily to the touch. The service was prompt and friendly and they refilled our water often (which tasted filtered!)"}
{"text":"I had the black and blue burger that was suppose to be medium but I think the take the black a little to seriously. The thing was beyond burnt. The waitress never asked if we needed anything.  When I did ask for things, she forgot to bring them.   I don't like writing bad reviews but I felt that I really wasted $42 here."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill. It looks as if they have not cleaned in months."}
{"text":"I would strongly suggest NOT going here.  The place looks amazing and is in a great location....all the while serving mediocre diner food.  Don't waste your time...or just go to the French Cafe \"Au Petit Four\" right next door."}
