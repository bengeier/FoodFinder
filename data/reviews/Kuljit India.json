{"text":"Wo made a reservation for 12 at this place,  on a Monday night,  to celebrate the departure of a friend moving to Europe.  We all got there,  and it was CLOSED!!!
NOT COOL
We had to scramble to find a place nearby."}
{"text":"Yes! Yes!
The spinach dish. Or the samosas.
Or the biryani. Or the thali....

Even for a vegan like me, you can't go wrong!!
Indian cuisine at its finest.. with a smile!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Love it..best India food in MTL. You MUST try the butter chicken and chicken tikka. Super cool family running it too."}
{"text":"Impeccable service, very quick and efficient. On top of that the food is delicious and always consistent. We go there on a regular basis and are NEVER disappointed!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of good inexpensive Indian restaurants in Montreal. This isn't one of them. Too much of the food is pre-cooked and re-heated upon ordering and the combination of flavours in the sauces is mundane at best. We ate at the restaurant once and ordered take out on another occasion. Neither experience was satisfying which is a shame. - The restaurant is close to home."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  They are inexpensive and they have a nice variety of vegetarian and meat dishes.  They have Bollywood movies playing in the dining area.  
Best dishes: 
*butter chicken and shahi paneer: the sauce is delicious
*Channa Samosa: to die for. Ten million times better than Pushaps!

You shouldn't  expect fancy shmancy stuff, but you can definitely expect delicious food!"}
{"text":"My go to place for indian food! The fish pakora, butter chicken and chana samosa are my favourite dishes in the menu"}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant in Montreal! Family owned business. The lady is so sweet! It does get pretty crowded on the weekends so don't forget to reserve! Their butter chicken is out of this world! The best I ever had! Bring your own wine & beer!"}
{"text":"J'ai fait plusieurs restaurants indiens à Montréal, dont le réputé Mailhi Sweets, et aucun de ces restaurants n'ont jamais égalés la qualité du Kuljit India. Petit restaurant familial, les proprios sont sympathiques. Malgré l'emplacement et la devanture peu invitante du restaurant, ça vaut vraiment la peine de s'y déplacer pour l'essayer.

Leur poulet au beurre est différent de tous les autres poulet au beurre que j'ai mangé, un peu plus sucré au goût et parfaitement épicé. Je suis même toujours déçue lorsque je mange du poulet au beurre ailleurs que dans ce restaurant. Et j'ai essayé plusieurs autres plats du menu, et c'est un délice chaque fois! Tellement savoureux, on devient vite accro!"}
{"text":"Garlic naan bread, samosas, butterchicken, curry lamb, fish pakora, tandoori chicken.  Mom and pop restaurant.  BYOB.  We takeout from here regularly."}
{"text":"Love this little place :) Possibly one of the best Indian restos in Montreal. They also do takeouts. This little discovery has made my jeans tighter. My recommendation would be to try everything. The lamb biriyani was pretty good. Butter chicken was so creamy, a little sweet for my taste. Loved the chicken jalfrazi and of course, I was surprised at how good their tandoori chicken tasted. 
Go try this place out people!!"}
{"text":"This place is 3 blocks from home, been going there for years. Butter chicken, naan, samosas with their sauces are all my favourites. But anything you order is garanteed to be fire even the desserts! It's family run and the lady at the cash is really sweet. It's great for takeout or even eating there. This place made me discover indian food and it is bomb!"}
{"text":"Kuljit is that hole in the wall you tell yourself you're better than, until of course, you actually eat there and realize how wrong you were; this place is phenomenal and they're serving up some of the best Indian food in the city! 

That's what happened to me. I was put off by the ugly decor and the scratched up, stainless steel dishes, however, upon trying their food,... let's just say my expectations were blown out of the park. The food is incredible, specifically their butter chicken and vegetable pakoras! The server, presumably the wife to the operation, is sweet and really takes care of you. The cook, again assuming it's the husband, makes fantastic food. And that's all there is to it.  True Indian food at an amazing price."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Portions were very very small. Butter chicken was very sweet. Goat curry didn't have much flavour."}
{"text":"The butter chicken and fried fish are really good. Especially dip the sauce of butter chicken with naan. Place is small, because it's a family business. Service a bit too slow, food is good."}
{"text":"Cause' you had a bad day, you're taking one down, you order takeout from Kuljit just to turn it around. Seriously, every time I order for takeout at this little gem my day becomes a good day no matter what. 

The dishes aren't light on the spices, exactly how Indian food should be - spicy and unforgiving. If you get butter chicken then you'll wonder why the same dish at other Indian restaurants aren't as good. When someone tells you to try butter chicken at x y z you'll tell them \"well...Kuljit India does it better.\" Do also try their fish pakoras. Light and fresh accompanied with contrasting bold sauces - heaven. 

Amazing cheap Indian food. You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"My revelation for this year is certainly kuljit's chana  samosa. Sweet hot sour tangy creamy crispy fragrant hearthy light rich just ridiculously tasty entrée. Really nothing bad to say about it. The dishes are generally rich and creamy... portions aren't ginormous, but it's made for you to try out different dishes. The biryanis are divine. I munched on my leftovers on the next morning. If you have been to at least one indian restaurant... GO NOW!

{"text":"I dont care how good the food is and that it's byow,  The place is filthy dirty. Saw one of the cook wipe his sweat w his hands. The wet cloth they clean the tables is so old and dirty it smelled like urine. Im really sorry for this review cuz i love indian food. But i cannot eat it if the place is dirty. We walked out before even ordering. We're not snoots we have been to many indian restaurants in park x. But this one we just couldn't swallow it. Sorry :("}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Indian food and wasn't disappointed at all!!  My boyfriend suggested I start with the lentil soup and it was bomb. No complaints. For the main dish we got a thali of curry chicken lentils rice and salad.  The chicken was amazingly tender well cooked the lentils with the naan bread delicious and the bread is amazing great texture not dry and soft."}
{"text":"Vous voulez manger le meilleur poulet au beurre en ville, n'hesitez pas. Il est superbe, en fait tout est bon, le poulet au beurre est simplement sublime."}
{"text":"Honnete portion, bon gout, végé et non végé, few tables, service attentionné, satisfaisant somme toute ;)"}
