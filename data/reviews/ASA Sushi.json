{"text":"Low prices, huuuuge portions, I would have loved this place in university. That being said, their rolls go heavy on the fillers like rice and fake crab (impossible to avoid in this place) and skimp on the nice sashimi meat. We ordered alcohol, apps, and the most expensive thing on the menu (large party tray) for just two of us, but they didn't bring one of those little freebie side salads, which I've sort of come to expect at little sushi places. Side note: we will definitely order their ramen again, as take-out, great broth."}
{"text":"I've been going here for a couple years now.  The sushi is always fresh and delicious.  Everyone who works here is friendly.  The soup and salad are yummy and I've not had a piece of sushi I didn't like.  They also do take out and it's really fast.  Mmmm."}
{"text":"Tasty and reliable sushi in Bloor West Village. I always order the double salmon roll - it is my husband (and kids'!) favorite roll!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to ASA since we moved into the neighbourhood (2007). We have never had a bad experience here. We have brought many friends and family to this restaurant and many agree that they are one of the best restaurants around. The food is amazing and the owners are the friendliest people! As regulars, we have occasionally received little extras on the house. This little acknowledgement goes a long way! They really know how to run a business. Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"This is one of our regular sushi places in the neighbourhood. We usually do take out but it's not a bad spot to dine in if you don't mind the slowish service. I like how private each table is and the decor is decent. However, the bathrooms could use some updating.   The sushi here is always fresh and decently priced. They have lots of vegetarian sushi options and creative maki choices which I appreciate! Definitely a good place to go if you're looking for variety and consistently good food."}
{"text":"It's easy to miss this little Japanese restaurant off Bloor and Jane, and it certainly feels secluded. Even the inside, which is criss-crossed with screens, is snug without being cramped. The schlocky, non-Japanese muzak, however, gets a bit annoying after a while.  They've got a really good lunch special for about $6 (the usual choices of sushi, miso soup, etc.), and the traditional carrot dressing on the salads strikes me as particularly tasty here."}
{"text":"Perfect for a date. Unique menu and style of dishes. Waiters could be taking their time, but if a date is going well - what's the trouble. The only thing - they close at 10 on Saturday, so have something planned for afterwards."}
{"text":"The reviews are pretty accurate, tried it for the first time a couple of days ago, super friendly family run business, with exceptional sushi, it will now be my regular local takeout sushi  place :)"}
{"text":"Great service but unfortunately I wouldn't consider going back there again. Their sushi dishes all consist up cheap fillers such as fake crab meat and cream cheese. I had high hopes for this place but thankfully there are plenty of other sushi places in the area. Thank you for the great service!"}
{"text":"Was going to give this place one star because they served me spoiled tuna, but as I was treated well and discounted the offending item they get a gold star.  Seriously though, with all the great reviews I was very disappointed with this place. The sauce they're using for their spicy rolls is disgusting, and the rolls themselves are remarkably small. The worst part? They're actually a bit pricey. So by putting themselves in the same ballpark as, say, Raaw Sushi, you'd expect a lot better.  I've had a lot of sushi in Toronto, and this is by far some of the worst."}
{"text":"A basic sushi restaurant, ate here last weekend and overall the food was good.  The service, although seemed friendly, was a little inattentive and the sushi sets were smaller that other comparable restaurants.  Unlike other restaurants we did not get a salad or miso soup with our meals."}
{"text":"Love ASA Sushi! :)   Yes it is extremely handy to my neighbourhood but it is actual one of the best sushi place I've ever been to! I bring all my friends here and everyone loves it!   Great selection with unique fusion rolls (try Jane and Bloor roll!), fresh and tasty sushi, friendly staff (even the chef smiles and says hi), nice atmosphere, good prices and if you want take out they are quick.   The only negative is that they are not open on Mondays!"}
{"text":"One star might seem extreme, but this place - despite the decent sushi - has awfully slow and oblivious service. My bf and I waited for a half hour without acknowledgement by their sole waitress. They give preference to takeout orders and ignore those who take the time to walk inside. We ultimately chose to leave. Take your customers for granted, and your success won't last forever. They've certainly lost our business."}
{"text":"Dependable sushi place that is a cut above average. Dragon rolls are excellent, tempura is light and cooked in very fresh oil. Menu is somewhat limited for hot alternatives, but what they have is good."}
{"text":"I don't know how they are still in business with their prices! Two can eat like kings for $30! Always greeted by a welcoming smile, this family run Japanese place is not to be missed."}
{"text":"I love their California rolls!  I'm not a big fan of it usually but The way they make the roll is amazing.  So tender and tasty.  I always get the California rolls  from this restaurant."}
{"text":"If you are looking for \"okay\" sushi as a quick meal than sure. But the sushi here is really not the best in the area. I am not a fan of their California rolls since they mince the crab meat and they taste funny. There are much better spots such as Yumi down the street on bloor or even better SUshi Place at Keele and Bloor. I only grab sushi from here if I don't feel like going a bit further down bloor and I need to grab a quick bite. Prices are pretty cheap though!"}
{"text":"The maki rolls are pretty good.  The \"bloor and jane\" roll is quite delicious.  The price is a bit higher than downtown Toronto sushi but if you are in the area it's one of the best I've had around here."}
{"text":"My go to Japanese place in bloor west village. The ramen and California roll combo is a staple. The bento boxes are good too. You know a good California roll when there is just a small amount of rice and the crab filling is creamy."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. They're lunch specials are few and not the greatest. $6 for sushi, beef or udon combos, and $11 for bento boxes.  Good service, forgot about us a few times, but not bad.  When the menu says spicy, they really mean it. Be careful.  Ordered the spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls, the spicy tuna was too spicy to eat. Also got the Special Crunchy Roll and it was delicious! They do a really good job at the fancy sushi rolls."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place years ago and tried to today, wow was it bad ! Did it go downhill ? I hate to leave a bad review but this was really has. I ordered take out, volcano roll and a spicy tuna hand roll and Wakame salad. Volcano roll was so salty and rubbery and the topping tasted like ketchup. The hand roll was awful, tasted like tomato sauce. The Wakame salad, I just took two bites and threw it out. It wasn't even chewable. It was as though it was mixed with plastic. I hate to leave a bad review, but I'm super disappointed. On top of that, the waitress / hostess also had her three kids in there spread out over the tables with home work and snacks. All super cute, but it was distracting."}
{"text":"I have this 4 star because nothing is terribly bad . But I  wasn't like wow I am gonna go back there . It's right beside my house so I went there for dinner with my friend . I just didn't have the time or energy to go somewhere else .  Ambiance is not bad . Food is not bad . You come h here because you have no choices . But not because you  wanna plan this and you are gonna enjoy yourself . I think you get my point ."}
{"text":"Great quality and very decent prices. We really like coming here. I recently tried a new place downtown and honestly was reminded why ASA is my favorite (that new place had the worst cut of tuna I ever had. At ASA I never have any complaints). Sometimes the small things they miss are: tempura a bit oilier, tea and/or soup not hot enough, and their wait staff is too distracted/hurried/not experienced (I honestly thin these girls are family - daughters or nieces - and they are definitely not in the waiting business lol). But in general - very friendly - and remember their regulars!"}
{"text":"The owners are very kind and pleasant.  The sushi overall is of much better quality compared to any AYCE In Toronto. I especially enjoy the Jane Bloor Roll, massively delicious. This place will continue to receive my patronage."}
{"text":"Meh. Extraordarily average. I could mention the pros and cons but my ambivalence about this place prevents me from bothering. Did I mention they have \"Robster Salad\"? Lol."}
{"text":"Sushi bars are a dime a dozen in Toronto but ASA is definitely one of my top choices. The staff is extremely friendly and will say hello to anyone that walks in... even if the chef is midway through slicing a maki roll!  The quality of the sushi and sashimi is excellent and there's a wide variety of rolls, nigiri, sashimi and combos to chose from.  As a bonus to all you veggies out there, they take great care not to contaminate vegetarian rolls with the pesky massago fish roe that stick to every surface known to man.  My only complaint is the dressing on the salad. It's a chunky citrus flavoured paste and I much prefer the creamy tangy dressing of other downtown locations.  All in all a great place for sushi on the west side."}
{"text":"Great place for takeout sushi. Definitely one of the better places in the West end esp since LAN sushi closed. Prices are reasonable. My go-to sushi place when I get a craving. =)"}
{"text":"The salad could use more dressing and the beef teriyaki was just average, but overall the meal was good. The sushi rolls were the best part.  One thing that does set them apart though is that they have all day bento box specials, whereas most other nearby restaurants stop at around 3pm."}
{"text":"Right across from Jane station, so a convenient for TTC users.  Came in with a group of 18 around 5 PM on a sunday. It was pretty empty at the time since they just opened for the evening, so they combined a number of tables together and re-arranged the walls as needed, which was pretty nice.  The interior is decorated pretty nice.  Menu comes with a lot of options, which is pretty normal. After 30 minutes of deliberation, four of us ended up ordering four \"Large Fusion Rolls\" that weren't available on the party trays, which are said to be \"double size\" and 11-12 pieces each.  The rolls were quite large. A lot larger than I expected. One roll would probably be good enough for one person. Enjoyed the taste and texture of each roll. Would say they are better than getting some of the roll combos.  Free tea. Free edamame Disposable chopsticks provided. Can't complain about large rolls."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love sushi?  Lots of sushi places in Bloor West.  This place is just north of Bloor at Jane.  The sashimi was fresh but it also didn't taste like anything other than cool chunks of fish.  I find this a common problem at many sushi places.  The spicy salmon roll was not done in the usual way that I've had it in other sushi restos.  It tasted like salmon combined with some tabasco sauce and turned into a roll and not in a good way.  The other rolls were fine.  Service was friendly and there was a line up of people waiting for our table when we left so it seems to be a popular spot for the locals."}
{"text":"Always dependable.   This is our local favourite Japanese in Bloor West Village.  Street parking limited before 6pm."}
{"text":"I go here when I can't bother to go downtown or when my sushi craving won't hold through the traffic. I find the rice is mushy (for lack of a better word).  Service is always great. But I can't stand the decor."}
{"text":"Good, reasonably priced, friendly service.  If you want spicing/sauce, this isn't the place for you.  Cool clean flavours, fresh fish, great vegetarian options.  NOT high-end, this is a neighbourhood drop-in casual sushi place.  They do heavy business in take-out as well."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places for take out. I have never had a bad meal here.    I agree with some other reviewers on slow service at times - however it's a family business and its understandable that they can't hire an army of waiters.  On those extremely busy nights even the cooks help bring out the food and they are always friendly.  They really try hard...  I prefer take out since I'm pressed for time and sitting in such a small space leaves my clothes smelling of tempura :))"}
{"text":"It's average sushi I would say. The staff was friendly but boy was the service ever slow. I'm not sure if I just went on an off night but it took so long to get our order or even be seated when there were lots of tables open. If I was in the area, I might come back but I wouldn't go out of the way to."}
{"text":"Great variety, keeping up with the nouveau sushi menus of interesting and varied maki rolls.  The sashimi pieces are almost too big, but very fresh.  I addition to sushi they also have a small Udon soup menu, and provide some alternatives for those who don't care for raw fish (chicken katsu, beef teriyaki).  The decor is plain, Japanese style, no frills.  Family run, and very friendly."}
{"text":"For those that say this place is great, they have not had proper sushi.  This was the worst sushi I have ever had.  The edamame was microwaved as was the soft shell crab for the spider roll.  The spider roll also has a funky fish smell (no pun intended).  The green spicy roll was horrible and the fish was not fresh.  Do not eat here."}
{"text":"Been coming here since high school and I love it!  Service is always great any time I go. Prices for a la carte are fairly reasonable.  Favourite roll is the You Go Girl roll. Its always made SO good! If you love cream cheese and salmon, you'll love the You Go Girl.   Will keep coming back here! Just hoping that they go through renovations, the place has been the same for so long now, would be nice to see it updated."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious. We ofter prefer for take out as the restaurant is small and you can not seat a group larger than 6 together. The owner appears to take great pride in the freshness of his fish and you can generally taste the quality. Another downfall is that they do not serve wine. Only beer and sake."}
{"text":"I've been going to Asa for quite a few years now it's a little gem in this neighborhood. The staff are really friendly and so are the owners. I love their maki rolls especially Jane and Bloor roll! So good. Their sashimi is always fresh and delicious when I go. I think the prices are good for what they give. The bigger maki rolls are HUGE compared to the ones downtown for a decent price."}
{"text":"This place is kind of mediocre. The sashimi cuts are pretty generous, but the prices are very high compared to what you can get at other places in the city. ASA charges about as much as, say, Wow Sushi, but is much less creative and has less variety in the kinds of fish you can get. Service is fine, not great. My teacup was empty for more than half of the duration of my meal."}
{"text":"I've been going to ASA for about 8 years now and I've never had a bad experience. They're maki rolls are delicious, and I love their spicy mayo. During the winter, I've always had a complimentary miso soup, and green tea. I love that they flake their crab for the California rolls. Whenever friends come from out of town, or I'm meeting my cousin for dinner - ASA is our destination! LOVE Thomas and his staff :)"}
{"text":"Maybe this is because I've had superb quality sushi but this sushi restaurant is horrible. I don't know about these great reviews to be honest. I ordered the spicy tuna and not only was the rice not fresh, the tuna tasted weird. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Ordered take out sushi last night from ASA. Unfortunately it was less than stellar. The rice was bland and could use more vinegar. Spicy salmon roll was one dimensional. The soy sauce was too salty. The worst part was that I found a strand of curly hair embedded in my California roll. It's safe to say that we won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Adorable small restaurant at the corner of Jane and Bloor. Easily accessible since it's across the street from Jane station. Very friendly staff that never fail to have a smile on, and the owner can be found behind the bar rolling the sushi himself. The prices are super affordable which is a plus given the neighbourhood. I always order either the bento lunch boxes or their deep fried california rolls."}
{"text":"Very delicious and great unique variety of sushi.  Very fresh ingredients.  Definitely best sushi restaurant in area and well priced."}
{"text":"We've been picking up Asa sushi for years. It's been amazing every single time. Quick, too!  We've eaten in a few times and the service is always friendly. Can't really comment on anything other than the sushi, because that's all we order. But it's the best sushi we've ever had."}
{"text":"I've been coming to ASA for the last 6 years, and I have to say it is my favourite sushi place.  My friends and I come here often and the service is great! The main guy who makes the sushi is so nice and friendly and the waitresses are all nice as well.    I always order the deep fried california roll, dynamite roll, and the crunch roll with their spicy mayo (soooo good). It's not all you can eat, and it's a little pricey if you order multiple kinds of sushi, but it is definitely worth it!  Even ran into Fefe Dobson there once!   I highly recommend this place, and it's very convenient because it's right outside Jane station."}
