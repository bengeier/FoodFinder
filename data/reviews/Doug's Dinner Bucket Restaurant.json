{"text":"Delightful find. We've been on the hunt for a great little breakfast place close to home since moving to Hudson. Not a fan of chain-type spots - and this was anything but. VERY fluffy pancakes and super friendly service. I see why they've been in the community so long."}
{"text":"Very small restaurant. Good food and good service. Staff was very friendly. Only drawback was styrofoam plates and plastic silverware. But the food made up for it."}
{"text":"It's so good. The owners is so kind. We had Bucket Burger Lunch and hot cakes, the hamburger is wonderful. We drive from Cleveland to here and it is worthy."}
{"text":"Friend recommended this place. I've literally past it a million times and never paid attention. 

Stopped in for lunch on Saturday. Menu is simple, prices seem reasonable. Got a cheeseburger, my friend got BLT and cup of soup (chicken dumpling). 

Nothing fancy, paper plates, plastic cups, plastic silverware. But if the food is good who cares. 

Lunch was good! Lots of hand cut fries, cole slaw was homemade too.  It was not bad at all, in fact it was great. 

Pat and Tony were very nice and hospitable. We ate and chatted with them for 30 mins. Nice Mom and Pop type business. Lunch was fun and it was nice to get to know the owners. These are the business you want to support. 

We will definitely be back. Many more times,"}
{"text":"Great down home food, coffee is hot and the service is great. If you have never been to Doug's put you kids in the car and head there now. They have limited hours mostly breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"I went to this place this morning with my boyfriend and I have nothing bad to say! I love hole in the wall places, the owner (I'm guessing Doug's wife) was very sweet and made us feel right at home. She spoke to us like she'd known us forever! I had the veggie omelet and it did not disappoint; it was packed with veggies and cheese. I also had a side of hot cakes and I don't think I've ever had a fluffier pancake. Overall this place is a good choice with simple, home style eats."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this place, we found on yelp. We really really enjoyed the food was so delicious! We live about 45min away and will totally drive to eat here! Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Small little hole in the wall.  It is definitely a no frills casual kind of place, but the kitchen is clean, the menu has a decent selection, and the food is all made fresh to order...nothing frozen (at least it doesn't taste like it).  

The owner and her son are there every day and make you feel very welcomed.  Great place for a quick, inexpensive, lunch."}
{"text":"Great food at fantastic prices...a must stop for anyone driving by! Where else can you grab a fresh homemade breakfast for under $4!"}
{"text":"Amazing place with amazing people that are very friendly. Pam and Tony are awesome people that will make you feel at home and like a regular. Very reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Five stars are reserved for those extra special experiences. Not to be melodramatic, but Doug's is totally deserving. 

The family who runs it could not be nicer! 

The prices are great and the portions are LARGE. 

I JUST barely missed breakfast but the BLT I had for lunch was delicious. Hopefully I can make it up on a weekend to try the breakfast. 

Thank you for wonderful service and true, homemade food!!"}

{"text":"This place is a refreshing change from same old stuff. Very convenient to highway. Small and homey and the owner chef takes a lot of pride in their home made food. 

The good home made bread was nice and the chicken sub good. The pot pie was ok, my husband thought it could use some carrots. Hand cut fries were fresh and crisp. 
Pam, the owner, was very accommodating. Reasonably priced and not huge portions which is a wonderful thing.

The bathroom is around the outside of the building and very clean.

We would definitely go back next time we travel near there."}
{"text":"If you dont know you're missing out! This is a great place for breakfast and lunch. Clean and friendly. Homemade everything. Stop just about every time I drive by and I have an appetite."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade country style breakfast. Everyone is local and makes you feel welcome. Definitely a hole in the wall place. Cheap, too!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and atmosphere unpretentious. Everything is always fresh. Servings are generous...prices fair / very reasonable. But the best part is Pam, the owner, who treats her customer like family."}
{"text":"I know what you are thinking. You've driven by this place hundreds of times and never thought about stopping for breakfast/lunch or dinner. It's time to stop. After reading several reviews on YELP we decided to have lunch. My family has lived within 2 miles of this place since 1998 and we were guilty of never dining here. What a wonderful meal. Fresh cut fries, homemade macaroni salad, delicious sandwiches. The woman who owns this place was very gracious and friendly. Felt like I was being propelled back in time and I had walked onto the set of an \"Andy Griffith\" show. Remember how Aunt Bee always treated guests like family. Nothing fancy about this place. But the friendly greeting and atmosphere is genuine. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I've been recommending DDB for many years.  In addition to being a 5-star restaurant, please note that they also cater.  Everything there is very good, especially the Pot Roast.  Thanks, Pam and Tony, for all the great meals!  I hope to see you soon!"}
{"text":"what a great find. This diner has been hidden in Hudson for 40 years.   Small diner that is open Tuesday- Sunday's. they serve breakfast and lunch . Saturdays and Sundays open til 2pm and breakfast served All day.. love the home fries and they have wonderful homemade hot sauce.  we will definitely come back. Friendly service."}
