{"text":"I'm so happy Mt. Albert has J&P's! Everyone there is so friendly...they always remember our names when we walk in. The food is great and is always consistent. Good prices too. My daughter especially loves the fish & chips."}
{"text":"Very good Ma & Pa shop. Minimalist decor, but that is made up with a good selection of burgers and toppings.   Since I was cycling with a few buddies from Toronto, this was the last stop before we headed back to the city.   The location is at the bottom of the hill on Centre Street, which is off Mount Albert Road. So we were glad not to hike up another hill to get to it.  There's a small sit down area that seats about ten people altogether. This is mainly a take out restaurant.  My corned beef kaiser was well prepared and I could choose my toppings at the serving counter. The toppings were fresh and the serving portion was to be expected for the price. Not quite like Pancer's Deli in North York, but more than good enough.  They take cash, credit and debit. Street parking in front of the restaurant. No bike parking, but there are places to lock up to, simply watch your bike from the restaurant window.  Overall, this restaurant delivered a tasty snack and shelter from the sun after a 140 km bike ride. With 70 km to get back home, this place reinvigorated us for the remainder of the trip."}
{"text":"Awesome Burgers.   Grabbed one my first day moving into Mount Albert and it sure hit the spot.  Owner was super friendly and welcomed me to town.      The second time I went I was obviously showing up just minutes before closing.  Without hesitation she fired the grill back up and flipped me an order with a smile.  These guys deserve 5 stars based on their service alone - but their burgers are top shelf as well!"}
