{"text":"Wonderful quiet restful sleep in a very comfortable bed.  Delicious breakfast of juice, scones, fresh fruit, clotted cream, raspberry jam, bagel, eggs, bacon and potatoes. All with friendly service. A hidden gem!!!"}
{"text":"Visited this business for tea with with my daughter for Mothers' Day and was delighted with the quality of food and the attentive service. Our server was knowledgeable about the large variety of teas served. Her service was timely but not rushed. The decor is cozy, interesting and complements the service and product. This isn't tea at The Drake, but a very pleasant place to spend a few hours. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at the tearoom on December 1st.  The tearoom is meticulously decorated and special touches are plentiful - even the menu is embellished.  We tried a modified high tea and were very pleased with our choice.  We got to try three different teas, one with each course of our lunch.  The starter was the soup or salad of your choice, the next course was the traditional finger sandwiches and sweet breads, and finally, we were presented with a lovely dessert trio.   Our service was impeccable - our server was attentive but gave us plenty of time to talk and enjoy each course of our lunch.  I think we all plan to return with others.  The tearoom would be the perfect place for a special lunch or small shower."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a weekday for lunch - no waiting. While the waitress was very nice - the English Breakfast tea was disappointing-- not very warm and weak! The chicken salad sandwich was small but tasty. Also tried a scone - which I had to ask them to warm up. 
I'm Irish so I take my tea and scones seriously:)
Decor is vintage and charming, but I'll go elsewhere for tea!"}
{"text":"What a jewel and so close by!!!  We enjoyed the tea.  Three pots of tea--each a different selection.  We had a salad, sandwiches and tea breads AND a delicious chocolate dessert.  Not the traditional English tea--still worthy of a visit."}
{"text":"Literally a life-sized dollhouse. 

Emerald Necklace looks unassuming on the outside, but step into the tea-filled foyer and you'll know you're in the right place. Reservations are required according to the website (11:30a is the first available time slot on weekends). My date and I were the only party there on a Sunday morning and had a two-person high tea party. 

The Emerald High Tea menu includes a bottomless pot of tea that stays heated over a candle on your table. I opted for the Gemini Rooibos, while bae got the Happy Ginger Chai. Both excellent, but the Rooibos was our favorite. The rest of the meal is definitely enough for brunch and includes the daily soup or salad, an assortment of pastries and sandwiches with Devonshire cream and lemon curd, and finishes with a dish of yet more desserts. The food was satisfying but not very memorable. The tea and decor are definitely the selling points, as well as the staff. 

There are few options for high tea in Cleveland. Only Emerald Necklace offers high tea that feels like you're in a vintage British parlor."}
{"text":"This place is so charming.  I've never stayed at the inn but I've eaten here a couple of times.  My mom and I did high tea and it felt so special.  This included savory and sweet finger foods as well as a pot of tea each.  The ladies working here were super warm and inviting too.  They also do a Downton Abbey themed tea which I've been meaning to check out with the other D.A. fans in my life.  Anyways, grab your grandma, put on some pearls and get over there for a cuppa!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed their tea luncheon very much.  Three small sandwiches, scone with the works, three dessert sampler, Quiche and fruit.  It was very relaxing and the food was fresh and yummy.  I enjoyed chatting with the InnKeeper Gloria.  She is supper friendly and charming.  The price was right in line with many of the tea houses I have visited nation wide."}
{"text":"Great central location in the cleveland area with hiking trails! Gloria did an inspired job putting together my sisters Madhatter Tea Party at the Emerald Necklace. Great selection of teas and snacks. Very accommodating and hospitable. Rooms are spacious, clean, and some have outdoor patios as well!"}
{"text":"Hidden little gem in Cleveland!  My husband and I booked this last minute just deciding to spend the night away.  The own met us at the door as it was after check in.  She was so sweet and accommodating, even brought us up a special desert in case we were hungry.  The room was so cute and comfortable.  Breakfast in the morning was delicious.  Loved all the beautiful china.  This place is definitely worth a try for a lovely getaway!"}
{"text":"Oh my sweet baby Jesus this place is adorable!

I made reservations for a Sunday afternoon tea party. Three lovely ladies showed up in their pearls and hats to enjoy this quaint place full of soft, colorful, feminine decor. There were other patrons (little girls, couples, older clientele). Staff was friendly; our young, new on the job, waitress tried her best to be pleasant and satisfy our needs. She even let us tour one of the rooms they rent out and told us about how this old building was involved in the underground railroad! 

For food/best experience, I went with the Emerald High Tea $25. To begin I got this Georgia O'Keefe cold tea starter in a little jar with a pink sugar rim.  Next I got to choose my own pot of loose leaf tea from a large section (I went with the Lady Londonberry). First course was a cup of chopped fruit and a slice of cheddar, tomato, broccoli quiche. (By the way, the goods were served on pretty china that your grandma Doris would love). Second course I chose a cute looking salad of mixed greens, fruit, and crunchy noodles (you can get a cup of soup instead of salad). Third course included finger sandwiches like cucumber with cream cheese, chicken salad, and egg salad. I also received a blueberry scone, two mini slices of bread (I think one was blueberry and one zucchini?), and spreads like Devonshire cream and lemon curd. The last course was all about dessert with a chocolate covered cherry, chocolate covered grape, lemon madeleine, frosted brownie, and a mini cheesecake. Individually all are small portions, but collectively it's a filling meal. 

I really enjoyed my experience here, everything was just lovely (minus this awful caramel apple tea that I tasted). You can come here to enjoy bed and breakfast accommodations, for a tea party, or even for the ice cream parlor that they have. The backyard connects to the Rocky River Reservation so you can go for a stroll through nature. I would highly recommend you check out Emerald Necklace Inn for an enjoyable experience! (I'd just like to remind little girls that there is no crying at tea time, pull yourselves together, you get to wear princess dressed in public, you should be thrilled!)"}
{"text":"This was a wonderful place to have tea with my little cousins. We had a party of 6 (with very demanding orders ;o) ). Gloria was AMAZINGLY accommodating and took great care of us. The tea was DELICOUS. Everything that we ate was absolutely divine. We will definitely be visiting very soon. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Mom and I made an reservation for afternoon tea to celebrate her birthday on Monday 9/5. We have visited several tea houses in the area, but this was our first visit to Emerald Necklace. It makes me sad that I didn't even know it was here- the building is so easy to miss if you're not paying attention.

I love the fact that this building is so old. It immediately presents a certain kind of charm and an age where things were much more simple. The d√©cor inside is exactly what you'd hope from a tea room. I wish I could have seen the guest bedrooms!

The table was set with all the usual accessories and we were greeted immediately by the owner, Gloria. It is very clear that Gloria pays close attention to detail and enjoys what she does. She went over the menu and the history of the Emerald Necklace Inn and really welcomed us. We even got a sample of a new fall apple cider tea and we sampled the aroma of all the tea we inquired about.

We settled on a pot of Rooibos Very berry Blend. It was perfect for us- she kept checking on the pot and making sure the strength was right.

We started with a soup (tomato rice for me) and an adorable salad for Mom. Should salad be adorable? It is here. My favorite part was definitely the scone with Devonshire cream and a delicious lemon curd. Banana bread was also tasty.
Next we had tea sandwiches- all very nice sizes, traditional and delicious. I was expecting a little cream puff or something simple for dessert- but WHOA! We got a trifle of chocolate mousse, cherries, and chocolate sauce. Served with a chocolate spoon! It's the details, people, that make all the difference for me. 

We had a very enjoyable afternoon and never felt rushed. That's how tea should be. The price was reasonable, food was fantastic and the service was top notch. I highly recommend Emerald Necklace Inn!"}
{"text":"One of the best high tea services we have ever had!  Went for a ladies afternoon tea (high tea.). Amazing service, no rushing, excellent food and a lot of it. Teas were exceptional compared to many other places we have gone over the years. What an adorable atmosphere too.  It was like stepping back in time!  

This is a MUST VISIT for anyone who appreciates a well done tea experience. We will definitely be back!

Many thanks to Toni and Gloria for the service and coordination!!!"}
