{"text":"In town for business- recommended by my hotel. Perfect! The service was wonderful and the food hit the mark. From the minute I walked in I could tell the food was going to be good by the clientele. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you like good Italian food, this is the place. There is always something great on the specials and they have that special WOW salad dressing that nothing else seems to duplicate. Nice friendly staff. Can sometimes take a while for your food, but why hurry a good meal?"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here tonight.  Cute little restaurant.  Server was ok, older lady that wasn't very personable.  Maybe it just wasn't her night.  I had sirloin steak for 16 bucks.  It was in this puddle of sauce and mushrooms that was very strong and salty tasting.  I wouldn't have it again.  My wife got the chicken ala Granny.  It was a different kind of dish, but she really liked it, she also got a side of the house pasta.  The marinara sauce was the best.  I wish I would have done something more Italian after I had a bite of that!  Oh well. For the two dishes and just water we spend 40 bucks.  Since it was that much I wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently moved to Pittsburgh from New York City.  We were directed to Tambellini Bridgeville Restaurant for authentic Italian cuisine.  The food is amazing!  Starting with the zucchini strips and wedding soup that were superb. My wife wanted to try the pizza because it was advertised as new to the menu. It was delicious!  The crust was crispy and the sauce was perfection.  We are kind of pizza snobs living in New York City for so long, and we are thrilled to have found amazing pizza in Pittsburgh!  We also had an order of the chicken parmigiano and it was so good.  Overall the food was delicious, authentic and all at a reasonable price.  The family style atmosphere was welcoming and cozy, and the service was friendly and prompt.  An added bonus was the connected bar/lounge in the restaurant. We enjoyed an after dinner drink and they happened to have live entertainment that night as well.  We will definitely be back here often!!"}
{"text":"A goods friend suggested that I visit this place and I was shocked that the quality was not that great. I know that Pittsburgh has too many Italian restaurants and I count this restaurant among them. Perhaps I am missing something, perhaps not."}
{"text":"We were the only two customers for at least 10 minutesbefore any other customers came
  We ordered from the luncheon menu baked eggplant and a chicken entre.  With no special orders or directions and no other orders from other tables, it took 50 minutes for our entrees to arrive - lukewarm.  Yes, the entrees were good, but our enthusiasm had long since gone.  Our waitress didn't seem to care nor did she make any apologies for the delay. We will probably not return nor would we give it a good recommendation to our friends.This used to be a very good restaurant - what happened?"}
{"text":"I love \"old school\" types of restaurants, and I wanted to like this one more than i did, but there are a few things that could use some improving: First, all the host and the server both reeked of cigarettes.  Also, I ordered a medium steak and it was beyond well (dry and hard to cut, let alone chew).  I did like the blue cheese dressing on my salad.  It was different from others I've tasted.  Beyond that, I'm hoping a further visit will be a good one, so I can change my review.  If you're searching for a good restaurant with a similar menu, try the Grant in Millvale.  It's a bit better."}
{"text":"Called tonight to see if they did take out and the rude lady on the phone said no we don't and hung up on me! If you can't be nice on the phone I don't want to see how rude you can be in person! Will never try that place!"}
{"text":"The fact that I am writing this review at 3 am trying to ward off food poisoning should say it all. We wanted to try this place because we got fundraiser cannolis from here that were to die for. Unfortunately the restaurant was not. Prices were ridiculous and the food was clearly frozen and re- heated, nothing fresh. I had the baked ziti- red sauce tasted ok going down- hope it stays that way. My husband got the seafood pasta- which he said were small frozen scallops reheated. My son got the kids pizza- pretty sure it was microwaved. Never again."}
{"text":"I didn't even get to order from here. Reason why I'm giving a one star is I called in for a takeout order. First call was put on hold. The person who answered reported that it would be a hr for takeout. At this point I think she thought I was going to say never mind. I told her that was fine. Put on hold again then hung up on. Called back man who answered the phone was very rude. I told him that I was just on hold to place a take out order. He could not hear me and yelled \"what?\" very loudly on the phone. Told him what I said again he had placed me on hold. The person who had originally told me it would take a hr for a takeout order is now telling me \"we are not taking orders for takeout\". Then rudely hung up on me. From that interaction on the phone I couldn't imagine actually going to dine in there. I just bought a house in Bridgeville and I will NEVER go to this place!"}
{"text":"Seriously great sauce.  The lasagna is superb and so is the angel hair scaglio.  Was here from the AF Base. Will be back next time we are in town. Maybe try dessert."}
{"text":"\"Babe, I don't think we can go here.\"
\"What? Why not?\"
\"Do you remember Rachel? She gave it ONE star. For service.\"
\"They've been open a while now,. You have to give them time to get the kinks worked out. Let's just give them a chance.\"

So we've been wanting to try this place for a few months now since we always see it on the drive home. Hoping to be pleasantly surprised, we made the 30-second drive and stepped into the restaurant. It was pretty busy, which was initially comforting, but the absence of a host(ess) for the first couple minutes brought my hopes back down. The hostess arrived and looked stern, stating that it would be a few more minutes before we would be seated. No welcome, just a firm statement. Okay.

Service was definitely slow, but our waitress arrived in a few minutes. I ordered wine and watched in a panic as she haphazardly reached across me to place it on the table, spilling wine down the sides of a tiny, but very full glass. My date and I placed our orders and I made my usual \"ew\" remark as he ordered his steak rare. The waitress picked up on it and shared an anecdote about her daughter and son-in-law--a strict vegetarian and a meat-and-potatoes guy. Totally us. We had a laugh and looked forward to our meal.

The crab stuffed mushrooms were pretty good, but there was a long wait for entrees, so we ordered another round of drinks. My wine came out in an even smaller glass (!?) than the first and my date was given a different beer (the first was still on the table, so I'm not sure why there was confusion.) I ordered a pasta dish, which was generously sized, but consisted solely of cooked noodles, blobs of cheese, diced tomatoes and shriveled spinach. It lacked sauce, flavor, seasonings--everything that would make it into a $15 bowl of pasta. The boyfriend's steak was disappointing enough that he didn't even bother taking home the leftovers. 

The waitress noticed I didn't eat much of my pasta and must have told the hostess, who came over and asked if I didn't enjoy my meal. I told her it wasn't what I expected and she walked away without another word. The server then came over and told me she was \"fixing\" the bill, which had already been presented. She then gave us the new copy of the bill with the pasta dish taken off. It was a nice gesture, but I'm surprised that the hostess never apologized, told us that she was offering a comp or took the opportunity to ask how they could improve the dish. It's like she knew what to do for customers in terms of service recovery, but not how to actually recover. It left me more disappointed and uncomfortable than if she had not done anything at all.

I'm glad that we satisfied our curiosity about the new Italian restaurant down the street, but this was definitely one of the most disappointing restaurant experiences I've had in a very long time. I would recommend stopping by Serafina's next door instead if you're tempted."}
{"text":"The food was not as bad as I expected from other reviews. I had a salmon dinner and thought it was quite good; however, my husband (who has a somewhat more sensitive stomach than i) has gotten sick the last two times we've been here, spaced out about a year apart, so I don't think we'll be back. 

The atmosphere is abysmal. It's dark. There was no music in the dining room. My water glass had water spots and food residue, and all of the plates seemed too small for the food that was on them. 

We had a reservation for 12 on mothers day, but they only set up 10 chairs. We were set up against a wall in a half full back dining room, which meant our server was constantly wedging herself next to me and handing food across the table (and complaining about how she couldn't reach, and never apologizing to me once). The server also tried to prevent us from ordering a kids meal, saying \"kids don't eat here\" and \"she won't eat it\" which was just ridiculous and insulting -- especially so on Mothers Day."}
{"text":"Prior reviewer called it old school and that describes this Italian restaurant perfectly.  We thought it was OK, we both got veal dishes.   Great service here too.  When we were there it was not very busy and we got the impression it never gets busy busy here, which is a plus at times.  Please note we like it quiet.   We went back and got the same meals again on a 2nd visit, so we thought this establishment was overall OK."}
{"text":"As my co-worker and I drove around the area waiting to go to the airport, we noticed this place and thought Italian food would be good. We were right.
     We didn't expect anything new or special. No fancy fusion dishes here and nothing close to the food in I've eaten in Italy. Just good old Americanized dishes and comfort food. Which in this case was just what we wanted.
     We had small salads, Pasta with meat and one with chicken. All of the food was good. Just what you would expect from an established eatery. Good consistent food. 
     I was very please to find that my food didn't come out overly salted like so many places do to bring out the flavor.
     Though I'm rating this 3 stars, it's more for the out dated decor and slow wait staff. The food would rate 4 stars but I'm averaging them out.
     I would eat here again if I lived nearby. I know I would get good, safe food."}
{"text":"A posthumous review here as this place has closed down. I know there have been some negative reviews on the service but I have never experienced that here. My Grandmother loves this restaurant, so we go for family dinner relatively frequently. 

The positives have been the friendly service and the rapid preparation for a rather large party. They have always seated us on time and provided a timely meal. 

The negatives, the interior and menu are both dated. It's like a restaurant that has seen only minor changes since the 80s. Its clean and warm...just dated. The food is also on the bland and uninteresting side. I've had any number of pasta and Italian themed entrees, and honestly, it's hard to review as they are pretty forgettable. 

One of my favorite things though is the entree descriptions on the daily menu. Things may be drizzled with scallops or splashed with artichokes. I try to imagine the preparation in this manner and it makes me giggle to see a chef throwing my scallops at my plate, bouncing everywhere. 

Oh well, my Grandmother is disappointed so that makes me sad. Supposedly a sports bar is going in."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it 4 stars because tonight I learned that it has been sold.  Boo hoo.  It was a great neighborhood bar to go to with pretty good food and entertainment on the weekends.  Tambellini's has been an institution in Bridgeville for years and years and years.  I'm so sorry to see it go.  Wherever will I go now in Bridgeville without having to resort to overpriced Rumfish???  :(  I'm hoping my source was wrong."}
{"text":"My first time at Tambellini Restaurant in years took place Saturday, 18 October 2014 for a take-out order of pizza and fried zucchini, both of which were tasty.  The problem lies in the amount of grease and salt in the dishes, which was a great deal.  The zucchini box stained paper underneath it and the bag it was placed in glistened with grease.  I took advantage of a coupon offer for $9.90 for a large pizza with one topping.  The Tambellini large pizza is considered a small at other establishments like the great Mineo's Pizza House in Squirrel Hill and Mount Lebanon.  It contains eight average size slices. The restaurant was stingy with the amount of mushrooms placed on the pizza, which were few and far between. I was intrigued by the low price for the zucchini, but found upon opening the box that it is a tiny portion relative to restaurants that charge more for the dish. The zucchini was limp from the grease.  The meat sauce which accompanied it was delicious.  The dining room is reasonably attractive and comfortable except for a few tiny booths which barely seat two.  The server who brought out the order ignored me, not saying \"thank you\" or acknowledging my \"thank you\".  She seemed preoccupied.  You get what you pay for.  I do not plan to rush back."}
{"text":"I was here a while ago and don't remember why I had not been back. A friend and I returned tonight since we were in the area. The food was very good, although a bit pricey for the rather dull atmosphere. The service left much to be desired. Friendly waitstaff, but not very attentive. Iced tea $2.60? That's crazy for a mediocre restaurant. No real reason to go back.
Prices too high."}
{"text":"I should have looked up the reviews instead of going in blindly - probably would have swayed my decision. I was expecting some delicious homemade food for the price we paid per plate. I'll start with the appetizer, the fried zucchini. The only thing I liked. Lightly battered, thinly sliced - really good in my opinion. That's where it ends. The soup of the day (clam chowder) was clearly store bought along with the coleslaw. The chicken cordon blue is debatable. My chicken parm was ok. All in all I just don't think it's worth the price they are charging - if I wanted store bought food I could have taken a trip to the store and saved some money."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about the Tambellini restaurants.  I'd heard one too many negative reviews so I just decided to avoid the restaurants all together.  Today was the end of that avoidance.  Oh, and those rumors of negativity.  Totally true.

As Jackie P says, I'm always a little fearful of Italian restaurants because no one cooks better than my little Italian grandma did!  So to come close to that is a feat that's pretty much unheard of.  To say they missed the mark on that big ole' boot we call Italy would be an understatement.  

We walked in and I swear I heard crickets.  NO ONE was in the place except for a party going on in the very back   I literally had to chase down a server because no one was even in the front to greet us!  She pretty much waved me off and said that our party was \"probably\" downstairs.

We had about 25 people in our party and only ONE server.  She never introduced herself, never asked us what we'd like to drink, never came around to really do anything except serve us a meager portion of buffet food.  

And the food....um....the Italian bread was good.  Seriously, the food wasn't gross.  It just wasn't a real hearty Italian meal.  The choices were parm fish, roast beef w/ gravy, chicken and rigatoni.  The fish was probably the best...but anything coated with cheese is!  

Best part for me?  The homemade biscotti that a family member brought.  Oh wait, that doesn't count for a star upgrade here...."}
{"text":"We love their red sauce and the chicken Parmesan was just right.  Also the zucchini appetizer is really good.  It's an older restaurant but the food is good and it's not too expensive."}
