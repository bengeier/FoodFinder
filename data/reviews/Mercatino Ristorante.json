{"text":"I went to this restaurant in 2015. The chef was outstanding. He has left which was sad and now it has been taken over by a wonderful lady. The food is different. There is variety but it's more of a hot table for lunch now. 

Food was not as good as the past chef but it does not mean it's bad. It's still good but more day to day foods rather than the specials I was used to before. 

I recommend if you are in the area to go by."}

{"text":"Totally suggested! Every dishes taste authentic and flavorful, plus, the lamb chops are extremely soft and tender, I'd like to come here when I older than 80 and my teeth are all gone but still enjoy this meal! But the way, I'm Chinese, but I love these Italian stewed meal, it's really close to my culture's traditional eating habits. Yummy."}
{"text":"Under New Management. this quaint little Italian hot plate has been taken over by a lovely lady who has brought in some new tastes and flares including Mexican and Middle Eastern cuisine including the classic Italian food that has been served here for years.

I came here for lunch and enjoyed a delicious pasta and meat plate, great coffee and excellent customer service.

Pricing is very reasonable and atmosphere is quite nice for an industrial restaurant.

If you work in the area this is definitely a place to note they've also added breakfast to the menu. For $7 you get eggs toast meat and home fries."}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian lunch time restaurant. You need reservations. Always busy. Daily specials. Staff are friendly and food is served hot, fast and delicious. I ordered the Gnocchi in wild boar tomato sauce emmmm!  My friend had the special Gnocchi in a cream and wild mushroom sauce with peas and shaved Parmesan. Oh very decadent. My waist expanded a few inches over that meal. The gnocchi was as good as mine, and that's saying a lot. Lol!!! Portions were generous. 
Too bad they don't open for dinner, but are available for special occasions. A little pricy for lunch, but was well worth every bite. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Mercatino Express located right next to Mercatino Ristorante is great option for breakfast or lunch if you are in the area.

Opens at 7 am serving breakfast with a choice of Cornetto (Italian Style Croissants) with fillings or Frittata goes well with a cup of cappuccino or americano.

For lunch there are also sandwiches, soup and salad to choose from.

Great place for a quick and healthy meal...either to go or stay in. 

But of course if you do prefer something heavier with table service during lunch, then Mercatino Ristorante next door will be a better choice!"}
