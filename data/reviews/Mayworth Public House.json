{"text":"A great little restaurant in a quaint southern town. My wife and I decided to stop in on a Sunday. It was busy but we were seated quickly. I ordered the fish tacos and a side salad with homemade Bleu cheese dressing, and my wife had the breakfast burger with the hashbrown caserole off of the brunch menu and both meals were great! Our server was awesome!  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite hangouts, the wait staff ranks really high (thanks James and Rebecca)--They take their job very seriously.  The food is awesome, even though I eat mostly salads these days.  I get the grilled shrimp added to the build your own which is excellently prepared.  Great rum cocktails too with a nice local draft beer selection.  I go about once a week just to see everybody that works there, excellent armosphere!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Friendly service. Attentive management. We were very happy with our meal here. There was nothing wrong with the previous place but this is an improvement.  Only minor negative is that the music in the bar is a little loud and echoes out into the dining area. Most people going to a pub probably won't mind it."}
{"text":"Decided to try Mayworths tonight for dinner. We were seated right away and the server was quick to take our drink order. We started with one of the advertised Happy Hour appetizers, soft pretzels with pimento cheese dip & honey mustard. It took awhile to arrive. The pretzel pieces were room temp around the edge of the plate and only a few warm pieces in the middle. We had to send the cheese dip back because it was cold. Our server picked the cup of cheese dip up off of the plate and took it to the kitchen. A film had formed on the top because it must have sat in the window awhile. The cook microwaved the heck out of the cheese, still in the plastic cup, and served it.   We ordered shrimp tacos and a burger. I will say that the burger was cooked perfectly and the tots were the hottest part of the meal, not counting the renuked cheese dip.  The shrimp were over cooked and tough. They were served on double-layered corn tortillas, which were stale. The water, or the cups, had a funky flavor, almost like mildew.   Not the worst place I've eaten, but not someplace I'm going to go back to anytime soon. There are lots of similar style restaurants in the area worth trying."}
{"text":"The menu had a great selection and it isn't your typical bar food.  Very good beer selection (locals) and great staff. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Beer selection fantastic. The wings were cooked to perfection. We had hot and garlic Parmesan mixed with mild. The service was fast. The kids loved and devoured their mini burgers and Mac/cheese. Also, you have to try the sloppy joe waffle fries. Worth the short detour off I-85. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"We ate here on Friday of the opening weekend and it was super crowded but we got seated relatively fast for a peak hour. The server was nice and she gave us the drink and food specials.  The food came quick and it was good.  The place has a ton of TVs and so if you want a quiet romantic dinner this is not your place. They had the basketball tournament going and so the crowd was definitely there for the sports.   Price was reasonable and would like to come back."}
{"text":"Decent menue, lots of items to choose from. Service could of then a little more upbeat. They do have awesome chicken wings though!!"}
{"text":"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome. Sloppy Joseph is incredible and waffle fries are prefect. Service was great and good drink specials."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Went on a Saturday night and the place was packed. Judging by the number of kids it's family friendly but I wouldn't take small kids. Sliders were perfect, fish taco and shrimp tacos were so good. Extensive beer and wine selection. Definitely a diamond in the ruff."}
{"text":"Food is good but I feel the menu is too limited. Needs to be changed-up every 6-9 months."}
{"text":"Fun place, trivia night is a blast.  Food is very good with nice variety.  Full bar and nice beer selection.  They have a nice back patio as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. I love the blackened chicken pasta most of all, but have never had anything here that I didn't love. They have some of the best waffle fries here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is brand new, and we waited a couple weeks to try it. Downtown Cramerton is extremely quaint, and we already have a favorite restaurant there (South Fork Deli). This is a wonderful addition to the downtown area! Very different type of food from South Fork, but also delicious!  The restaurant itself is on the dark side with lots of wood and not much lighting, but it's not unwelcoming by any means. We sat in a booth and it felt fairly private. There are big screen TV's to watch the games, but they aren't overpowering if you just want to sit and dine. (We went around 6 pm, so I'm not sure how this changes as it gets later).  Food wise, it was good. We would order some things again, and probably not order others - but everything was fresh, homemade, and unique! The menu is not huge but allows for a lot of customization.  Appetizer: We got the chips and queso. The chips were good. The queso was on-point with taste, and was definitely homemade and not from a can! But, the consistency was off. It was heavy and not as \"runny\" as I would have liked... more like a guacamole consistency. We would probably not order it again.  Drinks: We split two mojitos - black raspberry and regular. Again, we would probably not order them but more because of personal taste. They were VERY sweet, but the flavor was good. They used fresh mint leaves which was a huge plus! Just too sweet for us - but not a bad reflection on the bartender by any means.  Dinner: My husband just got a house salad and it was great! Lots more toppings than a standard house salad. I got the southwest chicken salad and it had corn, black beans, chicken tenders, spring mix, pico de gallo, and a BBQ ranch. The greens were fresh, the chicken tenders were impeccable, and the corn was clearly freshly grilled and cut right off the cob! DELICIOUS! The BBQ ranch sauce was delicious, although it got a little too spicy for me toward the end. However, the taste was on point - unique, delicious, and definitely something I would order again.  Something else great about this restaurant was the service! They were busy, but all workers were helping one another. Multiple servers brought our meals, cleaned up dishes, etc. The manager/owner (not sure) stopped by every table to thank us for visiting and ask how our meals were. Our server was quick with refills, the check, etc, but we never felt rushed. I hope that the enthusiasm with service continues as the restaurant loses the \"newness.\" It's nice to see a group of employees working together and keeping a restaurant moving!  Overall, the restaurant was slightly pricey, but quality was second to none. Even the food that we didn't love, was still made well and with fresh ingredients. We look forward to trying something new on the menu next time we come."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The food is pretty good and really nice location right across from Goat Island Park. It's perfect for lunch and then taking the kids to park after.   The last time I was here I had the cobb salad and it was enormous! For a salad it was incredibly satisfying. My wife had the Korean BBQ chicken sandwich. I only had a taste of it but it was pretty great.  Only minor complaint was that the last time we were there our server forgot about us towards the end of our meal. We waited patiently for the check probably 10 minutes after we asked for to go boxes and ended up having to flag down someone else to get things wrapped up. It happens, not the end of the world and most of the time things go fine.  I'd recommend this place, definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This was a fabulous place for lunch - we got the warm pimento cheese spread for an appetizer - YUM!  The create your own salad was perfect and something I wish more restaurants offered.  Wish we lived closer but we will be back when we are in the area again!"}
{"text":"Loved  the fish tacos and Mac Attack Burger. The sloppy Joe waffle fries are amazing. Wife's salmon was undercooked but staff handled very well."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Stopped in while passing through town on I-85.  A little off the interstate but totally worth it!  My husband and I both had great food and the beer selection was stocked with local craft beer!!!  Great surprise for a small town!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Had lunch here with friends. Shrimp tacos were a hit. Sandwich with grilled chicken & pimento cheese was excellent. And, for the gluten free, dairy free, pork free person, the make your own salad was perfection. Great service. We will come back!"}
{"text":"On a few occasions my hubby and I have ordered take-out from here and it was always good. We went to the resturant last week and it was trivia night. Place was packed and very loud but all in good fun. Service was great and food was good. Some items we have ordered over the last few months and enjoyed were.....wings (ordered hot), side salad was awesome, loaded baked potatoes were delicious, hubby loved the bacon wrapped meatloaf and waffle fries. Things we thought were meh were mac and cheese (bland) , burger was a little dry and chicken fingers also dry. Mayworth is a great neighborhood joint and we look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Love the salads here. One of the choices is build your own, picking 7 ingredients from an extensive list. All of the ingredients are very fresh and tasty.  I also like the iced tea here. Good flavor. And they charge a reasonable  $1.95.  There is a nice \"local\" vibe. Kind of like the neighborhood bar/grill that everyone searches for but rarely finds.  Part of the reason that is the friendly service from the servers and the attentiveness of the manager.  This is what a well-run local restaurant looks like!"}
{"text":"I went to Mayworth with a neighbor and I truly enjoyed myself. I remember visiting this establishment when it was Center Street Tavern ( probably said the name wrong) years ago. Nevertheless, I truly enjoyed Mayworth. From the time we walked in until the time we left,  Dana took care of us. Her hospitality was outstanding. The pub is very inviting and cozy. I really wanted to stay longer, but I had things to do.  I order the Jamaican jerk wings entree with a side of sweet potato waffle fries. The Jamaican Jerk was not to my liking. I felt it wasn't spicy or seasoned at all. However, the fries were so delicious. Dana suggested mayo with it, and I said no thanks, but do you have something else? She had me to try the chipotle sauce and man was it good. Afterwards, Dana asked me about my wings. I had to be honest, I just told her I didn't like them at all. She immediately said she would get me another flavor wing if I wanted. I said yes, and requested the  hot wings. When the owner found out that I wasn't satisfied he immediately came over to our table to talk with me. Again, I told him about the wings. He assured me that he would take care of me. The wings came out and boy were they good! I really enjoyed them. The owner comes back over and asked if I was pleased with the wings and I said yes and thanked him for taking care of me. This owner went above and beyond what most owners would do. I never got a bill so I had to asked Dana for it. To my surprise there was no billed because the owner took care of it. Most customer would say thank you right off, but not me! I wanted to fuss with the waitress about the owner taking care of my bill! He didn't have to do it, but he did and for that courtesy I'm so grateful. He will have my business from now on. This is the kind of establishment you want to embark on. You know you're going to be cared for here. Thank you for the love shown."}
{"text":"This place was fabulous! Atmosphere is wonderful. Tastefully decorated. Ample space between tables. Booths are private. They have an outside covered patio. The food was excellent! NOT typical bar food. I had fish tacos that were absolutely delicious. My husband had the Korean bbq chicken sandwich. There was so much more I wanted to try! Our server was prompt, attentive and friendly! We will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"What a find in quaint Cramerton! Our server, James had an awesome personality which made for a pleasant experience, however, the food is the star of the show! The house  made pimento cheese has just the right amount of heat and the Mayworth chips are scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Love this local spot! Food is fantastic. Get the sloppy Joe fries - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very very very yummy! Can't believe how much food! We started with the Sloppy Joe Fries this was enough for a meal for BOTH of us! But we were ambitious and ordered more food! Wings- yumm, Chazz's meatloaf- yumm (and an awesome name!) sweet potato fries- yumm!  They also have a good selection of craft beer on tap and in the bottle! Great service very friendly! Overall very impressed! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed eating here and food had always been great... however we ate there yesterday and my husband ordered a hamburger that was to be cooked medium well. It was raw. Cold in the middle it was mooing  GROSS."}
{"text":"The build your own salads are very good here. As a sports bar it is lacking, they don't seem to have a full selection of NFL games available. We like it just fine other than that."}
{"text":"First time in.  Visiting friends from the area. Nice atmosphere, warm and inviting. The food was good, nice portions.  I am saying a 4 star rating because they need to work on the service. Not terrible but there is room for improvement. It maybe a new business and they maybe working the bugs out.  Everything else was wonderful!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the greater Charlotte/Gastonia area, hands down! The beer selection is great, the sloppy joe fries should be renamed \"ambrosia\", and the veggie tacos are killer! We've brought our dog along several times when we sit in the outdoor seating area in the back (only downside is the occasional smokers). We live in Charlotte, but the short drive to Cramerton is worth it!!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent resturante for great food, and service. The best in town for friendly socials and having a great time!"}
{"text":"Overall I liked this place, it's a sports bar so expect it to be loud!  I decided to have appetizers for my dinner because I wanted to try a couple of different things.  I had the small order of bee sting wings and the sloppy Joseph waffle fries.  The waffle fries were outstanding, the flavor combination of the sweet sloppy Joe with the spicy jalapeños and queso was a winning combination.  The wings were average, good but nothing special.  I was disappointed with the blue cheese, it was very runny and thin with no chunks of blue cheese to be found.  I am looking forward to coming back and trying some of the entrées."}
{"text":"When in the middle of Belmont,NC this little pub is a good spot to hit. The staff was prompt, the ambience good, the beer selection impressive, and the food above average. My colleague and I happen to dine on a Friday night which is also Trivia night and I must admit it was a blast. I ordered a salad with seared tuna and it was pretty good. My colleague ordered the wing entrée and it was plentiful (7 wings and a side)."}
{"text":"Mayworth's is one of my go-to's. It's always a solid choice. There's not a huge menu, but you'll find something to please everyone from the \"chicken tender plate\" to your more adventurous foodies. It can get quite busy, and for good reason.   The sweet potato waffle fries are AMAZING, and the regular waffle fries come with some kind of chipotle bbq ranch sauce that is good on everything. The mac and cheese is comforting, with some fun options to dress it up if you like. I've had the spinach and goat cheese sandwich made with chicken, it's a bit like a gyro sandwich, and a great lighter option. The korean bbq chicken is good too, tangy, but I usually get it without the bun because it's a bit big and unwieldy with the extra bread. The pretzels are also a really yummy appetizer, but I'd recommend a double serving of the honey mustard sauce, and skipping the queso. I've never done a salad there, but I'm looking forward to trying the wings at some point. Plenty of beer and wine options, I like to go on Mondays for half-price wine."}
{"text":"Nice quiet atmosphere for lunch. The turkey club was excellent and the sweet potato fries are perfectly crispy and salted. My server Serena was very attentive and efficient. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Had the chicken lettuce wrap and buffalo chicken tacos and they were bomb. Sooo... freaking good."}
{"text":"Neat sports bar/restaurant located smack-dab in the heart of Cramerton, a quaint southern mill town.  It exudes Americana.  Think Mayberry and you get the picture (sans Andy, Barney & Aunt Bea).  I've visited twice for lunch and both times was treated warmly with friendly staff, good food all at great prices.  My advice:  pull a seat at the bar, say 'hey\" to Bree, nurse a frosty and enjoy some well-prepared grub.  Me likes it!  Nice."}
{"text":"We were visiting the Daniel Stowe Gardens and decided to go local food for lunch, checked yelp and decided to give this place a visit.. They had a lunch special of the day so we chose it.  Ordered the Buffalo chicken tacos and sweet potato waffle chips.  Both were very good and with a very reasonable price! The staff was excellent. Highly recommended to give it a try if you are in the area.. ."}
{"text":"Very impressed with our experience at Mayworth Public House. Courteous service, delicious food and solid prices. Any place my wife can get fish tacos and I can get a burger is a winner! Everything came just as we ordered it, and we both enjoyed a piece of delicious cheesecake for dessert for $5.99. Cool that they have a brunch menu as well. We'll definitely be back for a second go around!"}
{"text":"Great little pub located in historic downtown Cramerton! Don't be fooled by the pub label however as this place serves up some wickedly good food. In particular, the Buffalo chicken tacos are fantastic. I have ordered them on both my visits along with the thinly sliced, perfectly fried sweet potato waffle fries and have been very satisfied both times.  The fish tacos also rock as do the collard greens, which may be the best this greens lover has ever had.   The service is very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is festive and attractive with wood floors and beadboard booths. Will always eat here whenever I'm in the area. It's  almost worth the drive from Charlotte (I said almost)."}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice restaurant and were tired of the same thing. Found it on yelp and were very impressed. The burger meat was so good you didn't need mustard or ketchup. The Cajun Catfish was very good. Waffle fries were good with a crispy cheese sprinkle. Also have a nice selection of beer. D9 on tap. Would go there again and recommend it to others. Good to see a nice end restaurant/bar in the gastonia area."}
{"text":"The service here was great. We had Matt as our server and they transitioned smooth into a new server with Jeremy. Both were on their game and Tiffany was a fantastic bartender who served us before we sat ourselves out on their back patio.  We came on a Saturday night and they had karaoke.  It was a fun night with great service!"}
{"text":"Was a regular customer at Center Street and was very sad to see it close.  When we saw that Mayworth was opening, we were very excited.  We've eaten here several times.  The food is ok but the atmosphere doesn't have the same welcoming feeling that Center Street had.  Plus we went to Center Street for brunch after church almost every Sunday because it was so affordable.   I hope they change up the menu and run their brunch longer on Sundays.  The Sunday Brunch crowd is a very important crowd and it seems that Mayworth isn't interested in this."}
{"text":"Visited again on NYE with a party of 6.  Our server disappeared for a long while.  5 out of the meals were good.  I ordered steak cooked med rare it came out well done.  The Manager came over remade my steak and it came out close to well done again. The manager apologized and offered another steak  with a desert.  The ladies took him up on the desert.  I went ahead and ate the second and he took it off the bill.  All in all, my two experiences were solid and I still plan to revisit."}
{"text":"This is our absolute favorite place to go for dinner. The sloppy joe waffle fries are my most-craved food EVER! And Brittany at the bar is the most wonderful person to get your drinks from. All the service has been great, and we have zero complaints. Also karaoke night on Saturday is our favorite time to be there for Jimmy J's jams!"}
{"text":"Maywood burger was excellent!  The sweet potato waffle fries were also great! Had 2 different beers not normally seen on menus here. Service was wonderful too!  Highly recommend you visit this small eatery. I see they have karaoke starring at 10 tonight."}
{"text":"Definitely a sports bar. Really fun on Sunday's! Staff has great customer service skills. Good beer selection but wish there was more since it's a public house. Food across the board is good too! Don't drink their water though. Seems to be a known issue for a long time."}
{"text":"Come on, Yelp -- this place is a 2 at best. I was totally suckered into this mediocre dinner by reviews that are way too high for the actual quality of the place. What a waste. Weird service, salty-as-hell sides, tough steak ... wish I could get a redo on this particular dinner choice. Just because you live in the sticks doesn't mean you rate something a 5 for simply existing in your town."}
{"text":"For such a small town, this place is almost always busy!    Everything I have tried here is consistently good. Typically when I'm in the mood for wings this is my go-to spot!   The owner is super friendly and is there most days!"}
{"text":"Consistently excellent food. My entire family loves this place. Every sandwich on the menu is amazing and you have to try the house special \"Sloppy Joseph\" (don't pass up on the jalapeños and queso)."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I really like Mayworth.  It has been a favorite.  The food is always great.  However, I often dine alone.  I was very angered the last time I went that the server assigned to my section walked by no less than three times, looking me straight in the eye each time.  While she co tinted to flirt with the table next to another server asked if ---- was helping me and proceeded to take my order.  The server who was supposed to be over my section stayed at the same table go guys for a solid 10 minutes, and then proceeded to roll her eyes when the other server asked her a question.  She never once so much as acknowledged me.  Needless to say I made certain to tip in cash that night to the server who ACTUALLY helped.  Ever since I feel like I get an attitude when I go in alone, and I always tip 30% or better.  It makes me less inclined to go to what was once a favorite spot for me."}
{"text":"4 picky, retired folks came for a late lunch and had so much good food and fun we stayed for 2 hours!!  The staff was welcoming, sincere and down right fun!  Every single thing was fresh, tasty and had a creative twist. This restaurant may be a little out of your way, but if you take the time to seek it out you will not be disappointed!  Meatloaf snuggled in a blanket of bacon! Sloppy Joe served on a brioche bun.  Roast beef piled high on a special Weck roll, and Buffalo chicken tacos with a tasty sauce for dipping.  I don't want to test your patience by going on and on about the sides, but I should.... pasta salad, sweet potato waffle fries, and OH the mac and cheese. Nothing ordinary here.  Really, each item was planned and executed with thought and attention.   And then there was dessert!!   Cakes from Queen's Bakery in Charlotte... need I say more???  All were over the top good, big slices, and exceeded expectations.   We finally departed with leftovers in hand, not wanting to leave one tasty bite on the plate.   So...what is most important--food or service?  We've been to places where the food was special, but the service so bad it ruined the meal. It is really hard to beat a place that serves tasty food with a sincere smile, sense of humor in a welcoming atmosphere. Kudos to the staff!! That combo makes this place a special gem you shouldn't miss.    We are only in town for 2 weeks and plan to go back before we leave  -- there are other things on the menu we still have to try.... and yes, more dessert please!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch spot!    Went for the first time today and had a great experience. Waitress was very helpful with her suggestions.  We started with the Sliders Appetizer, which we delicious and plenty for a full meal.  I had the Buffalo Chicken Tacos, which were delicious. Tons of flavor and very fresh.  Sweet Potato Fries were also amazing!    Overall, we had a great experience with great service, great food and a few great drinks!"}
{"text":"Best waffle fries ever! Great beer and wine selections along with great cocktail menu. Had the regular burger with side salad and waffle fries. If you love crispy waffle fries then these are for you. Salad was fresh and the burger wasn't a thin patty. Looks like the homemade kind. Check was about $50 for 2 burger, 1 cocktail, a side salad, and 3 draft beers. Not too shabby. Sports bar feel and music in the background. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great lunch today!  I've been wanting to try this New place.  We started with pimento cheese dip and chips which was amazing...great amount of heat.  I had the California Black Bean Burger with avocado and pepper jack cheese.  Burger was great.  Our waitress did an excellent job with our large group of 6 women and 3 kids!!  This is a great addition to the community."}
{"text":"Mayworth is a classy edition to the Cramerton area. The space has been resurrected in an all new exciting way. Rich, dark woods everywhere you look. Mid sized bar and a ton of flat screens. Best of all are the beer selections that include rotating seasonals from NODA, Triple C, and Sugar Creek on tap, plus an extensive list of bottled beer. Lots of great appetizers, including mussels steamed with chorizo, garlic and fresh basil. There's a really neat build your own salad section. Looking forward to trying the burger with Mac and cheese with bacon next visit!!! Yes they put it on the burger!! The Beef on Weck also looks killer!!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is delicious! Last time I was in I had the southern burger, it was great!  Chill atmosphere, friendly staff, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"What a great place.  Has the warm feel of an old Irish bar but with updated and finished look. Great view of TVs from any seat, solid beer selection and the whole family was very happy with the food. This is what a bar/restaurant should be."}
{"text":"This place has become one of my favorites. Thursday and Sunday beer specials and outstanding food. The staff is quite regular, as in they appear to be staying with the business. Has turned out to be much better than my first assessment. So far, I have nothing but kudos for this restaurant."}
{"text":"First here so I tried the burger. It was very juicy and moist. For my side items got mac and cheese. It was  very creamy but not very cheesy. They have a large selection of draft and bottle beers at the bar. Lots of TVs. Great place to come for lunch during the weekday. I have not tried them on the weekend it. My waitress was very attentive and she checked on me at least 5 times in 30 minutes. LOL"}
{"text":"Sooooo good!! I'd give them 5 stars but the service was quite slow for a Thursday afternoon. The food was worth the wait, though, and our server was super sweet. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with the spinach and goat cheese style option - wow it was delicious! My chicken was a bit more burned on the outside than I would have liked, but I pulled off some of the pieces and was able to enjoy it none-the-less. The hubs got the foot long hot dog southern style which he inhaled. We both got the pasta salad side which was very good - lots of veggies and lightly dressed so it's not your typical pasta salad (at least from a Jersey perspective). I liked this place a lot and wish we didn't have to rush to the airport to return home - I would have happily stayed for another round of drinks and maybe even dessert. Thank you, Yelp, for pointing this place out! We wouldn't have known about it otherwise."}
{"text":"The small town of Cramerton has a couple of eating places. This has been opened for a year, friendly staff, so so menu. The Pimento Cheese dip was decent.  Not spectacular. I had the Jamaican Ribeye, MR, my husband had the burger, medium.  Both were very undercooked. Bake potato was cold.  Seasoning on the Ribeye was interesting. My steak was rare, cool to touch, and poor quality. A Ribeye should not have excessive gristle throughout.  Having said that, this is a neat gathering place for friends and couples wanting an evening out without a bunch of riff raff.  I would stick to the standard bar food and forgo the dinner menu."}
{"text":"This used to be a go to place for us, but several months ago, we noticed a new manager.  He seems far more interested in hanging out than managing a restaurant.  Today was the last straw.  The same manager sat us, and we waited more than ten minutes.  No server approached us, and the manager was just shooting the breeze with his obvious buddies.  We won't be back.  Sad to say, because we really like the atmosphere.  Please let me know when you get rid of that horrible manager, and I'll be happy to give you another chance."}
{"text":"Probably the best customer service I have ever gotten at a pub. Recommend the sweet potato waffle fries! Just moved the area and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great service, good atmosphere. Wings were awesome, but the cooks need to realize grilled chicken needs seasoning. Had the heater chicken sandwich and it was super bland. The \"Siracha mayo\" wasn't spicy, and the chicken tasted like nothing. I'd probably go back, but be more careful of my choices."}
{"text":"I had one bad experience at Mayworth, but it appears that it was just a bad night.  I have been back three times since the last review and the food and service was perfect."}
{"text":"You should know I reserve 5-star ratings for truly exceptional, exquisite experiences. 4-stars means I'm a fan and will return often enough to become a regular.  I've been here three times now and have enjoyed each visit. The service is good, the food is good, the atmosphere is good, and I really like sitting out in the back open area.  Try the Sloppy Joseph fries appetizer. You won't be disappointed. The bacon wrapped meatloaf is good. I've never seen anyone get anything they weren't happy with.  I've been there with a group of about 6 people and another group of about 14 people. All had a great time.  I would recommend Mayworth Public House to anyone."}
{"text":"We live in the area and have visited several times. Each time the restaurant has been light traffic. Tonight we entered during shift change and our waitress did not show up for 20 minutes. I asked to speak to the manager but she never showed up. Passed by us multiple times but never stopped. Food was average and service was poor up front. Too many choices in the area so we will not be back for food or drink."}
{"text":"This was an overall delightful experience, and exactly what I was looking for when it comes to pub food.  We came on a cool Friday night, around 8:30pm.  It wasn't terribly crowded, nor loud.  We were promptly seated and our server came by quickly for our drink order.  Alas, they were out of the one beer on tap I wanted, Bell's Two Hearted Ale, but they did have Hop Drop & Roll in the bottle so that minor misstep was overlooked.  As an app, we got the pretzels.  Two large, soft pretzels come with a pot of queso and a pot of mustard.  These pretzels were delicious; chewy, salty, and brushed with enough butter to make them glisten.  The queso and mustard were excellent complements.  For my entrée, I got the classic burger with some sriracha mayo.  My wife got the spinach and goat cheese black bean burger.  I got the standard waffle fries, while she got the sweet potato waffle fries.  My burger was cooked about as well as a burger can be.  I asked for it medium, and while it was a tad medium-well on the edges, overall it was great.  What made this burger special was the seasoning.  It was PERFECTLY seasoned.  A round of applause to the line cook and his judicious use of the salt shaker.  The bacon on the burger was also perfectly cooked, the sriracha mayo I got on the side was par for the course, and of course what tied it all together was the Martin's potato roll, literally the best bun you can use.  I savored every bite.  My wife enjoyed her burger.  Both the regular and the sweet potato waffle fries were great as well.  Crispy, hot, and well-seasoned.  Exactly what you're looking for in a french fry.  Prices were exceedingly reasonable, the quality was high, and service was excellent.  I'd consider Mayworth Public House to be a higher-quality, more reasonably priced alternative to some place like The Liberty in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Lemme just say this is an adorable and friendly little pub. Never went to the old place. I highly recommend what it is now though. Diverse menu and pretty appropriate pricing. Good regional beer selection as well as some regular cheap standby beers. I would come here super often if I lived nearby."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for Trivia Night.  I recommend!  Great location in small downtown near the river.  Nice atmosphere, attentive staff.  I've tried the pretzels, chili, and a burger.  All were very good.  I need to get back and try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 5 and had the bacon cheeseburger, Mac and cheese, shrimp tacos, fish tacos, and chicken tenders.  Everything was very good!  The tacos were delicious.  The Mac and cheese is homemade. Cute place  and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Our experience first and certainly not last experience at Mayworth's was great! The decor and overall ambiance of the restaurant was dark and somewhat industrial. I loved the woodwork and the Edison bulbs in the lamps put a nice touch on things. The TVs in the restaurant were appropriately placed to give you something to look at. I loved the tall backs on the booths as it did offer privacy to your table. The booths were not padded which is fine to me as some restaurants have sunken booths that are uncomfortable.  The bar was beautiful and rustic. Definitely a welcomed addition to Cramerton! The patio area was not offered but the option is there. I wished the area was not so fenced in.  Food was good. I had the Mayworth's chicken. The siraracha sauce gave it a nice kick but was perfectly balanced with the tzatziki sauce. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the marinade reminded me of a Greek marinade I've had before. The rice its served was a a bit much. It was literally an bowl of rice with chicken on top. I would have much rather had a smaller portion of rice and a vegetable.   Maria our server was EXCELLENT! She was pleasant and professional. Her silent service was appreciated and her recommendations were spot on. Maria made the experience very enjoyable by serving our needs perfectly."}
{"text":"Me and a friend stopped in for dinner on a Sunday afternoon. We had the pimento cheese dip and tortilla chips as an appetizer. The pimento cheese dip was warm and very good. It was not spicy.  For our meal we had the veggie tacos, collard greens and the sweet potato waffle fries as our side. The tacos were perfectly seasoned and nice size proportions. The sweet potato fries were crispy and cooked just right. Our serve Jeremy was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. He was able to make suggestions to help us with what to order. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very good food!  Recommended by co-workers and worth the trip. The black bean burger was perfect and the mussels were delicious in the spicy tomato sauce with andouille sausage.  The music trivia was icing on the experience cake with the whole place joining in!"}
{"text":"Well we just found another spot to add to our favorites list!  The beer and drink list is incredible and is sure to satisfy any craving. The food was delicious, service was courteous, friendly, and efficient. We will most definitely be coming back and recommending"}
{"text":"My wife's salad was huge and amazing.  Great mix of greens, fried sweet potatoes pieces and delicious marinated cucumbers and onions. She is on a very strict diet and she had many options to choose from. Their make your own rice bowl will be her choice next time we go. Oh yeah my taco and fries were great.  You can see the river from their patio. Oops, I reviewed the wrong restaurant, should be Doffer's Canteen. Gonna try Mayworth next Saturday."}
{"text":"Overpriced and average. It's been awhile since I went in, so maybe things have changed. Long story short, quality is not the first priority. I was also asked to leave a good yelp review last time in exchange for a lighter tab, but wasn't on the platform then. Wouldn't change anything for me and I find it incredibly sad of them to even ask. More of a morals review here, but I just can't support a place that is both average and desperate. Better places in the town to eat in my opinion."}
{"text":"We stopped by for dinner tonight. We started with the lettuce wraps, which were very tasty. Then we ordered our entrees. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich (Mayworth style) and my friend ordered a grilled chicken salad. Lots of very tasty options for sandwiches and salads (customizable). The real thrill was dessert. This eatery gets its desserts from Queens City Pastry. This is a great pub, with a great beer menu, and great food. The service is friendly, the food is good, and the atmosphere is inviting. We are sure to come back. Make sure to stop by and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Hamburger sliders were solid. Bar tenders attentive. Great group of people who could sing on karaoke night."}
{"text":"Unique location with excellent offerings. Located right in downtown Cramerton's town square. One of the South's historic mill villages, we had a great time waking around the neighborhood and Goat Island park before dinner. Great beer lineup and food offerings, we particularly enjoyed the build your own salad option and the beef on weck."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, service was weird. We were told there was a wait of 15 minutes for our party of 2. There was another group of 6 waiting also. Thing is, there were 4 empty tables. After waiting about 10 minutes, the party of 6 was seated at one of the tables that had been empty the whole time they were waiting. 10 minutes later, we were seated at a table that had been empty the whole 20 minutes we were waiting. Not sure why, my husband would  not let me ask. Maybe they do it so the wait staff and kitchen can keep up? Not good business.  This place won't last with the current menu and service. Plenty of people working, the place is not big so no excuse"}
{"text":"So the place is nice. I was a bit surprised that when we ordered the items did not come out together. I did enjoy my hamburger but my husbands fries came out later. I loved the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"The wings were really good. I took my girlfriend out on a date here. We only met an hour ago. I used this dating website called Craigslist. She was really nice and I made her get just the salad cause I was cheap. Ok enough about myself, the food was absolutely amazing. I would recommend this place to anybody who is bringing a blind date.    PS just kidding my 3 year relationship girlfriend would kill me if she found out that I posted this review lol"}
{"text":"We showed up about 7pm on sat night with a party of 10. The placed was packed somehow got seated in about 15 min. Service was prompt and on point. Everyone was very happy with their meals and my 9yr old daughter said the mini burgers was the best shes ever had lol I have the fish tacos and they were great. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I have dinner at Mayworth about once a week with my friends, and we have never had a bad experience.The staff is always cheerful and timely when taking an order, and the managers really go out of their way to make sure your dining experience is everything you would want it to be. Excellent food, great beer selection, and all at very affordable prices.  If you're looking for a good appetizer to feed a larger group, definitely order the sloppy joe waffle fries. You won't be disappointed.   Need a place to take your furry friend? They even have a patio section out back where they allow customers to bring their dogs! With the Goat Island park right across the street, I can think of no better way to spend a Saturday than taking my dog for a walk in the park and then hitting the pub for a cold one."}
{"text":"Great food and service! I got the  shrimp tacos with sweet potato waffle fries and my husband got the mac and cheese with bacon and jalapenos. Both were very good and the rum runner drink was very strong! Will definitely be back with family in tow..."}
{"text":"This place compares to restaurants in Charlotte, fresh ingredients and great flavors!  Atmosphere is inviting and service was great plus the food was delicious!  So far this has been the best place we have eaten in Gaston County.  I had the vegetarian tacos and my husband had a burger.  This will become a regular place for us to visit."}
