{"text":"My girlfriend and I love this place, it's one of our go-to dinner spots!  The peanut sauce is especially good, although I've never ordered anything I haven't liked!  (The shrimp soup is wonderful as well)"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of S-BT's curry, especially the Ka-Ree. One day I ordered the Ka-Ree over the phone for take-out, not realizing that there's also a noodle version. When I realized my mistake my reaction was, \"Meh, I'll just try something new!\" Although the sauce and meat were flavorful, there was just something about those noodles that I couldn't deal with: they seemed kind of gloppy-mushy, and very nearly tripped my gag reflex when they went down. So it's back to the CURRY version of Ka-Ree for me, and I'm a happy camper!"}
{"text":"I had eaten lunch at Sa-Bai Thong a few years back and remembered it being pretty good, so while in the area running errands, my fiance and I decided to try it for dinner. While the atmosphere is clean and the decor is nice, I was very disappointed with the meal. I ordered the Pad Si Ew and my fiance ordered a yellow curry dish with tofu. While sitting at our table I could see into a small area going into the kitchen that had a microwave cart. I watched our waitress put a plate of food into the microwave which she then took out and brought right over to our table (which was my dish). She set my fiance's curry down also and quickly rushed away without checking if we needed anything else. The curry dish came missing the tofu. We waited for 10-15 minutes before the waitress came anywhere near our table (we had to flag her down) in order to tell her that there wasn't any tofu in the curry. At this time, we were pretty annoyed and also inquired as to why my dish would have been microwaved. She tried to reassure us that my dish was made fresh but that it was done before the yellow curry so she had to re-heat it... which is just poor planning. My food came dried out and the noodles were sticking together. I would have rather received our meals at different times than have my meal re-heated in the microwave. She did get my fiance a bowl of tofu for his dish but at this point, he was almost done eating. She gave us 10% off our bill for not including tofu in the dish but did not address the microwaved food.  I have had much better Thai food and service for much less money (even with the 10% off). This was a total waste of time and money and we will not be returning here."}
{"text":"I ordered their food through grub hub, and was thoroughly disappointed. I got a call from the restaurant asking if I still wanted my food at the estimated delivery time. It was going to be 45 more minutes. On top of that, when my food finally got here, it was wrong. Ignoring all of that, for what you pay, the servings are incredibly small, the food mediocre."}
{"text":"Ate here one time.
Pad Thai
Spring Rolls

The Pad Thai was the most unusual Pad Thai I've ever had, in that it really didn't taste like Pad Thai at all, was too dark looking (too much soy?) and was basically crap.

The spring rolls were a little better, but not better than the nearby Vietnamese place.
So I do not recommend this place at all.
If you want good Thai (for Madison) go to Thai Noodles on McKee.

Adios!"}
{"text":"I agree with Alex S. I have had the similar problem. The waitress was not very friendly. I am from neighboring country of Thailand so I can handle spicy food like most natives can. I have been to Thailand once a few years back. I ordered papaya salad and a curry dish. I ordered the hottest of the hot dish and i ended with the sweet version of the papaya salad and curry was okay. I went in there to satisfy my pallets and all I got was a modified version. I felt total let down. I have not been there since."}
{"text":"I'm staying at the Marriott and a local at my class recommended this restaurant. I was so tired after working all day and it's so cold out that I couldn't stand the idea of going out.  Lucky, these guys deliver.  They delivered delicious  curry to me in just about an hour.  Delivery charge of $2.50 was so worth it and the meal was perfect!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places in town. They have great curry, as well as noodle-based dishes. In addition, they have decent alcoholic beverages. They also deliver!!"}
{"text":"Food is not very good and overpriced.  Service was poor. This place used to be good so ask people who say they love it when the last time they were there."}
{"text":"I went there over a year ago. The food was good but the service was terrible. Especially considering we were one of only three couples in there.   I would give them another chance."}
{"text":"The pad Thai  is too soggy and wet, if a Thai restaurant can't make a reasonable Pad Thai, then they don't have good Thai food.
I went there twice, never want to go 3rd time,   the other rice noodles are tasteless also.
The services are slow.
But they have ok appetizers."}
{"text":"Food was OK last night.  Not as good as I remembered.  We've been coming for over 10 years.

Let's just focus on the bizarre service last night:
1. They forgot to bring water for a quite a while
2. The four of us (my wife and two girls, one of whom was not feeling that hungry) ordered 3 entrees (mus-a-mun, crispy duck, and tried a new dish).  The waitress (I think might be the owner, or else the worst waitress ever) was clearly unhappy and made comments like, \"O only 3 entrees?\"
3. We asked for an additional bowl of rice, she said, \"O, you are not done eating?\"
4. When the check came, she made a point of sending only 3 pieces of chocolate (Get it? You order 3 entrees, you get 3 chocolates!)
5. The girls were feeling tired, as they headed to the car, I waited for them to bring my credit card back.  The same waitress came and asked if I wanted to order cupcake and macaroons (Hello?  The table is empty, they're all gone.)  When I said, \"No thanks,\" she asked, \"Did you have enough to share with your girls?\"

The waitress (owner?) was I believe extremely offended that we only ordered 3 entrees (with tip came out to over $50.00) for four people.  She couldn't stop making that point to us over and over again.  

It was funny yet awkward experience to be at the receiving end of so much passive-aggressive anger.  

But suffice it to say, while this restaurant used to be a favorite for special occasions (I came for my graduation, the girls' birthdays), that will no longer be the case."}
{"text":"They make the best Thai curries ever! My husband and I eat here often and feel that this is the best Thai place in Madison. They are very vegetarian friendly and can make any dish vegan. I have had Thai food at many places (husband loves Thai food) and we always feel like it's never as good as Sa Bai Thong. My favorite is the jungle curry!"}
{"text":"We like authentic Thai food - found it here in Madison! Fantastic coconut soup, papaya salad, minced beef and I'm sure many other Thai plates...
We tried it so far twice and will surely come back!"}
{"text":"I like this place and think it is one of the better Madison Thai restaurants, though I think the other location on University is better and more consistent. Had take out and only one dish was memorable. Still, it's my go to take out place when I am visiting the parents on the west side of town."}
{"text":"Good food and good size portions. One soup is enough for two. If you don't have a large appetite, you can probably share a curry or noodle dish too. Tasty food, and they can definitely make it spicy if you ask them too which is great. Ambience is great too, will be back soon!

Friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Ordered some tom yum and panang curry to go, food was great and actually spicy like I asked! It was also ready very quickly. I don't give them five stars because they use the tom yum paste in their soup rather than making it all from scratch, I'm a bit picky when it comes to that."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment.  The place was not at all busy (Saturday evening, around 7 pm).  Service seemed slow, though there was an abunance of employees standing around the cashier area.  Our food arrived luke warm at best and cooled to outright cold within minutes.  The veggies in our dishes were overcooked.  I'm guessing the food sat for a while before it was delivered to our table. 


Food is served on a large scallopped plate and cools off very quickly.  I'd seriously suggest returning to the older style covered aluminum serving pieces, or a deep bowl at the minimum.

When we communicated to our server (when she finally checked back with us to see how the food was) that the food arrived lukewarm and over cooked, she indicated that next time we should let her know sooner so she could warm it up.  Hmmmm. Methinks warmed up overcooked veggies are not going to fare well.

Additionally, a dish advertising basil had none.

We won't be returning.  This was a waste of $30+"}
{"text":"The Penang is out of the world. Jungle curry was really good. Pad Thai was just ok."}
{"text":"Great food, weak service. Saturday night so the place was full but not crazy. Seated immediately, but waitstaff only showed up on request after loooong wait. Then delivered a wrong beverage. The food, however, made up for it. Apps came quickly - lettuce wraps were excellent and had a terrific sauce. Shrimp purses also excellent, though we used the other sauce - the included sweet/sour sauce was unimpressive. Entrees arrived at same time, hot, and were good. Management should know I would've ordered a second drink if ever asked (I wasn't), and we asked for check quickly fearing the wait."}
{"text":"Their food was okay and that's the only reason why I have them 1 star. 
0 for the customer service. A few weeks ago me and my husband went in and our food just came out and 5 minutes into eating our food our waitress came out and said \"we close at 2:30 and right now it's 2:16 so you guys have to leave soon.\" Like, bitch what? So you just going to kick us out? At least let me know prior to taking my order so I'm aware. She could've just told us that they close at 2:30 and I would've already gotten the idea that I need to leave instead of pressuring me to gtfo. Never returning."}
{"text":"Got the ka soup with shrimp and crab Rangoon. Everything was delicious. The soup had some great flavor or lime cilantro and chili"}
{"text":"I'm very hard to please and they nailed it. Great friendly service, very good peanut sauce with the chicken satay and proper beef panaeng just how I like it. The spice rating system is a little Americanized, I went with 3 out of 4 stars because when trying a new Thai place it can be dangerous to go full tilt the first time but if you can eat a jalepeno popper you can handle 4 star heat there. I've even heard that the university location does it better so I'll try them soon and report back."}
{"text":"The squash curry, pa-naeng curry, and jungle curry are all outstanding. I get the tofu option, and I've had enough soggy tofu in my day to really appreciate how perfectly this tofu is cooked. I've never eaten in the restaurant, but my boyfriend and I carry-out regularly."}
{"text":"I going to preface this review by saying that, in general, I have lower expectations for service and decor at ethnic restaurants - that is why this got s 4 and not a 3.

Service/decor - I see alot of negative reviews on here citing bad service. I've been here on three occasions and each time the service has been white good. Granted, I was there weekend nights and not on a Tuesday afternoon. Decor is VERY nice compare to comparable restaurants in town.

Food - It always pleases me. I have found, and my Asian boyfriend has confirmed, that Sa-Bai is kind of a fusion between authentic Thai and what, apparently, a contingent of Madisonians want. I'm more than okay with this, as I have enjoyed every meal here.

Price - You pay for the nice decor and friendlier service. I'm willing to pay the extra 3/4 bucks an entree for that any night."}
{"text":"I'm in a bad bad mood - (spoiler alert!) Jon & Kate are separating! I'll try not to take it out on Sai Bai Thong too much.

So I'm in town for Epic training at the Radisson and I figured I order some pickup right before J and K's \"special announcement\". I got back from my workout at about 7:40pm; I figured, \"Hey, I got 20 mins to spare and the place is just around the corner\". The only thing was, no one was picking up! I called about three times consecutively and still no answer. I called the other location in downtown Madison and they picked up instantly. The person on the phone just advised to call again. 

Already irritated that my precious time was dwindling, I gave them another ring and they finally answered. I put in my order, drove to the restaurant, waited another 20 mins and made it back at about 8:15. Fortunately, J&K hadn't made their announcement yet so I wasn't missing out.

Anyway, so here I was ready to plop down and enjoy the food and the show when I realized they didn't even pack me any silverware or napkins! Isn't that standard for takeout? I had to call the service desk to bring some to my room. Trifling!

Now to the food; the one thing I can say about this place is that it doesn't lack flavor. Whether that's a good thing; that is the question. I ordered Som Tum (Papaya Salad), Crying Tiger (Thai Beef Salad) and Chicken Satay. The Papaya Salad had a decent flavor which was pretty consistent throughout . The Chicken Satay was saved by the peanut sauce (probably one of the better peanut sauces I've tasted); otherwise it was average. Finally, the Thai Beef Salad was just off. When I opened the container, I had dig to find any greens. It looked like nothing but shredded strips of beef.  In that case, it should have come with tortillas. Secondly, my first bite felt like accidently taking a gulp of water from the Red Sea. Super salty!!! 

Overall, the food was ok and service was subpar - I need to find a new Thai spot to hit up whenever I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"This is a nice (looks family) run restaurant. The service was fast, good and I had plenty of follow up checks from staff. The food was quite good. Been to many Thai restaurants and I always see slight differences due to regional differences. Would definitely return when back in town."}
{"text":"Made my 2nd trip to Sa-Bai Thong. First trip was not great, but not bad. Ordered the Pad See U, which is my typical dish at Thai restaurants. It was mediocre. This time I got the Pad Thai. It was average as far as Pad Thai goes. Service was okay"}
{"text":"Not exactly the most authentic Thai food I have had. Well this wasn't exactly Thai food. For what it was it tasted good service was OK. Had to flag down the waiter multiple times to get a refill of water."}
{"text":"What an absolute surprise. Was not expecting some of the best Thai I have ever had in a strip mall in Wisconsin. A great find and a destination to return to."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Thai place I had near my house ! Their food is absolutely delicious. I had been many times to this restaurant and simply loved whatever we ordered. They have some best soups I would
Say, Tom Ka and Tom yum are superb, definitely must try! Appetisers are too good. Jungle curry was my favourite from all yummy with perfect spice and so appetising. 

They have great decor with pleasant atmosphere and quick ,friendly service. They have pretty solid mid priced options and the portions are pretty generous. I have been here many times as they have some Excellent menu.  Also there is enough of parking available in front of the restaurant. This place is busy during weekends so you can plan ahead of time.

I would highly highly recommend this place to Thai food lovers and definitely try their fantastic soups and coconut curry entrees !!"}
{"text":"I love the food at Sa-Bai Thong. People can debate, but they had me at scallion dumplings.

There were more shrimp in the Tom Kha on the west side, and was it just me or was the pork a little more flavorful?

The service, as always, is unpredictable. 

The space is less intimate here than the mutiple booths that break up the one on University. But there is a nice framed view."}
{"text":"Food is good and prices are fair. Service is a bit lacking once your food is delivered, however. The Tom Ka soup is outstanding."}
{"text":"I got the yellow curry with vegetables (I think it's called KaRee).  It was delicious. I snarfed it down before I thought to take a picture."}
{"text":"We got the Tiger Beef salad dish, pork larb and squash curry from here and all the dishes was too sweet.  If it were more spicy and sour then it would have been good.  We took a few bites and that was it.  Could not finish it at all as it was just too sweet and not to our likings.  Will never order here again."}
{"text":"Sa Bai's two locations, one (recently renovated) on the near West Side, one further West on Odana's restaurant strip, serve reliably satisfying and tasty  Thai food and are justifiably local favorites in a town that loves Thai food and supports quite a few of them for a city of its size. Atmosphere is quite attractive and comfortable in both locations. There is a large menu with many delights; at least until recently, the Odana (not Obama, not Osama) location had several  additional dishes, especially good at dinnertime. The chefs are cooperative with spicing requests, allowing for more assertive dishes than are available in most Madison Asian restaurants. Food usually tastes fresh and lively. Soups and noodle dishes are usually excellent. Service at the University Ave location is usually quite good; the Odana location is spottier, often with long waits at dinnertime. We've had good luck with delivery from the Odana location, although certain dishes (e.g., duck) are best when eaten fresh from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Yas! Wonderful food, great service, and chill environment. I got the tom yum noodle soup, ask for the chili to make it just right!"}
{"text":"Food was OK.  Summer rolls (AKA Spring Rolls) appeared to be the last two available for the night, sort of banged up and falling apart.  The shrimp special was quite good, as was the Crying Tiger (chicken).  The place was absolutely freezing though.  We had to keep going out the the car to get more clothes to keep from shivering.  It was over 80 degrees outside and it felt about 60 degrees in the restaurant.  Service was also very good. Would call it 2.5 stars if I was able to do so."}
{"text":"To-go item : Kaopad with chicken

Normally I visit sabaithong restaurant on university avenue but this is the first time I got something from sabai on Odana road..
The food tasted awful..
Looks like yesterday's food was heated up and given for my take home order.."}
{"text":"very nice environment, lack of waitresses, cool food. However, their summer roll (unfried spring roll) is not as good as that from Saigon noodle."}
{"text":"Wow...I love this place. Great Thai food..very reasonable prices. Beautiful ambiance. While waiting to be seated, there were several people coming in to pick up carry out orders. Service was very good. Highly recommended restaurant near West Towne Mall."}
{"text":"I've been the take-out queen this week.  Tonight Dad wanted Thai, so here we are.  I pulled up the menu online and ordered Pad Thai, Pad Chu Chee and two Thai Iced Teas.  They told me when to show up and it was ready when I got there.  The tea was packed with ice in one cup and the tea/milk in another so we could pour it together when we were ready.  That was groovy. 
The Pad Thai was just ok.  I get major Pad Thai cravings and this just didn't quite do the trick.  It wasn't bad, I've just had better.  The Pad Chu Chee had a nice coconut milk flavor in the sauce.  It was good.
Overall, I'd go back.  Don't remember how much it cost - it was reasonable."}
{"text":"We recently tried Sa-Bai Thong at their Odana location. We'd never tried Sa-Bai Thong before and we were blown away.

The Odana location we visited is in a little strip mall. Once you go inside it's tastefully decorated with Asian decor and it has a beautiful view of the lake out back. There's actually a lot more tables than you would be expect judging from the outside.

We were greeted and seated by a friendly hostess and then an even friendlier waitress took our order. We ordered the Shrimp Purse as an appetizer, the Tom Ka with chicken, and the Pad Ka-Ree. The Shrimp Purse were delicious. Spring roll skin wrapped around shrimp, chicken, carrot, and chest-nut and then fried. They were so good. Great flavors and texture. The Tom Ka was simply amazing. Chicken, mushrooms, and the coconut milk sauce. I practically licked the bowl clean. The Pad Ka-Ree was more soupy than we were expecting, but again the flavors were fresh and complex.

Great decor, great service, and simply amazing food. We really enjoyed Sa-Bai Thong."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to write this for awhile. I just want to say, WOW! This place was amazing. My husband and I went to dine there and had gift certificates that were about to expire. We had not had a chance to use them and they were expiring in one week. We had $100 worth! It went a loong way . The staff was extremely nice and went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. Som-Tum, papaya salad was something I usually would not order and was a perfect compliment to the meal. Spring Roll and Chicken Satay were my two favorite appetizers. Very refreshing. My favorite curry was the Ka-Ree, but they were all good. The surprise of the day for us though was the Sticky Rice with Coconut Custard. Dessert is something I usually do not order either and it was soooo good. It really plays on the hot and cold temperatures and I cannot wait to order this again. (at $3.95, you have to) The food was great, but the staff is top notch and they even helped us spend the rest of our gift certificates, suggesting on numerous things to go.They really treated u slike royalty. I will definitely come back when I am in Madison again, Those of you who live there, I am jealous."}
{"text":"Yummy Thai food close to the hospital. Nice option when you're tired of hospital cafeteria food."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. Their customer service is very rude. When I was having lunch there today, the waitress kept interrupting me and asking me if I have finished yet. When I got my check, I was replying emails on my phone but she just stood right next to me and watch me. I felt extremely uncomfortable with my dining experience at Sa-Bai Thong. After signing my check, I was heading to the door, but then she stopped me because she wasn't satisfied with her 10% tip. Even with the very annoying dining experience I still gave tip to her to show respect, and she didn't let me go unless I increase my tip to the amount she wanted??? I've always been very generous about giving tips and only not giving much when I have very unpleasant experience. So if you are like me, do not go to this restaurant. It will ruin your day."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, delicious margarita, nice atmosphere! I would recommend this place for great Thai!"}
{"text":"This must be the year I eat meals with a coat on cause it was cold in the restaurant during dinnertime. 
This is one of those places I go to when I feel lazy and I'm craving a noodle or curry dish. But of course, I always get mad afterwards, cause I know I could have made it at home. I ordered the Ba Mee Chao Nue noodle dish that consists of lo mein noodles, veggies, and a black garlic sauce. It was good but didn't stand out from any other takeout Chinese lo mein dishes. My hubs ordered the tom yum soup and that was a delight to the taste buds with its sour and salty broth. The restaurant provides a nice environment that helped us catch up on the day (even though we didn't feel warm enough to take off our coats). 
Service was attentive, but on the slow end. We sat in a booth and immediately noticed that the furniture was getting old as we could feel the springs and see cracks in the pleather."}
{"text":"Friendly service, reasonable prices and the food had a great variety and creativity that thai restaurants often lack. The food is more american thai than authentic, but they still do a lot with that limitation. 
As a point, if you like your food spicey, you really have to request it, otherwise it will come back Madison-approved hotness free."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away a bit, but super close to the mall and right by the exit of the freeway. I was having some mad cravings for some Pad see ew so I yelped it and it came up! I met my friend here and we were immediately seated. The staff was really attentive and came to give us water and take our order almost immediately. 

What I found super funny, however, was their menu. For the common dishes like pad thai and spring rolls those were all on there, but the spelling of some of your other favorite dishes might be different. For instance, as I mentioned I was craving pad see ew, and I almost gave up on getting it because I couldn't find it on the menu. When I took one last look through the ingredients rather than the name I found my dish! It was labeled pad z you. So just a note.
The food itself was good. Not great but good. What was great was their thai green tea. Usually thai tea is made with black tea but I'm a real sucker for green tea so it was a dream come true when I found this on the menu. I was basically in heaven when I took my first sip. It was amazing, creamy but kept the integrity of the green tea and not too sweet. A definite recommendation in my book.

As a last plug, I wanted to highlight how accommodating and understanding the kitchen is. There was a party of maybe 6 that sat next to us and before we ordered they were placing their order and we overheard every little specific detail. Like talk about only veggies, just carrots on this one, can you get the peanuts on the side, but only for those two and this one extra cilantro. All for the same dish. Obviously what I wrote was pretty generic expectations, but the fact that the server smiled, got the entire order right (each dish has a specific ask) and the patrons looked happy with their order at the end, I feel like needs some kudos. 
Happy thai tea lovin!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times with friends and my wife. Every time, we've enjoyed our food and the service.

Our most recent experience was with a group of 6 people. Service feels like 'home' as my wife puts it. You're continually asked how you're doing and how the food is, but not in a way that is annoying. More like when your grandmother is making sure you're doing okay and eating well. So I agree with her when she says it's like home.

I usually get the curry fried rice with the \"careful\" or \"adventure\" spicy level. At times, there can be too much onion in the dish. Otherwise, it's very good. It's not too spicy that the flavor is gone. My wife has always enjoyed getting any noodle dish, so no complaints from her.

Probably one of our favorite spots here in Madison for Thai food."}
{"text":"Great food. I love that most of it is stuff I can eat (no gluten or dairy). Huge variety and their website is super clear about allergies."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the overall ratings of this place. It has held up as being my favorite Thai cuisine in Madison for many years. I'm a huge fan of the curries(have not tried much else) and the thai iced teas. It can be busy and service can be taxed-especially for takeout/delivery."}
{"text":"Alas, this place seems to be getting worse and worse over the years. I tried it again last week because it was Monday and Saigon Noodles was closed. I just wanted soup. I ordered the Tom Yum. 
It comes with a little salad. It was fresh and good but the dressing was pure sugar. My daughter had the chicken satay. The peanut sauce barely resembled peanuts. It was also really, really sweet and had a few peanuts in it. My soup was sour-- not that nice sweet/sour mix that is typical with Tom Yum-- just sour. It was edible though so I ate it.
To get in and out for under $20 was nice and the service was pretty good.
Bottom line: if you are on the West Side of Madison on a Monday and want soup... lower your standards and eat here. Otherwise, go to Saigon Noodle or (if you really, really need Thai food) head to Ha Long Bay on Willie Street."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Sa Bai Thong West, the service was good, the food seemed to have a pizzaz to it. The value for the money was spot on. I enjoyed the egg rolls the most. I also enjoyed the sticky rice!"}
{"text":"I've had Thai food in many different places and this was not good, unfortunately. Service good but food not recommended :/"}
{"text":"The Sa Bai Thong on Odana is one of my go-to places in Madison, but I have to admit, it's hit or miss. If you want a good experience, don't order delivery. Their delivery person is always overburdened so the food is cold by the time you get it. However, when ordering take-out or dining in, the quality of the food is always great. The service is meh, but the gaeng ped is what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"We've been going to Sai-Bai Thong I believe since the 1990s. While the food has been good the service levels have gotten to the point where we're never going back. Tonight was the 4th time of bad service and we're done. We had ordered an online pickup. The site said pick it up in 20 minutes. Arrived 20 minutes, paid, and proceeded to sit for another 35 minutes. Finally went up to ask on status and found out food sitting there for at least 10 minutes. Asked for refund since the fried food was cold, they refused. Too many great restaurants in Madison to continue supporting them."}
{"text":"My husband and I went this past Friday night.  We had originally set out to go to La Meztisa up the road but they were very busy.  The food is always good SBT,  but the service takes forever.  I think it took at least 15 minutes for someone to come and take our order.  Then our food came out slow because the kitchen was backed up.  Again food is always good but you definitely have to either not be super hungry or or not be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Some of the tastiest Thai I've had in awhile!

The squash curry was scrumptious, bursting with flavor. 3 stars heat level (one notch below the highest they offer) was plenty for me -- they don't mess around. Pad thai and fried rice also crazy delicious. Some items are pricey ($7 to $9 for soups??) and I would have liked more veggies (onions, peppers, etc.) along with my squash and tofu, but other than that it was great.

Very nice atmosphere for eating in. The take-out scene was nuts on a Friday night; we were quoted 20 min and it ended up taking 35. Annoying, but at least you know they're making it from scratch when it takes this long. Recommend calling ahead, although confusion seemed to reign at the front counter, with orders under the wrong name, wrong food, never received, oh wait actually it's right here -- so maybe better just to dine in. They also deliver, but there is a charge if you live beyond 3 miles."}
{"text":"Anybody who has had real Thai food knows this is glorified Chinese food. Very disappointing. Way better options in Madison."}
{"text":"I have been there twice for takeout. 
The dumplings were outstanding. Best I have ever had from a restaurant. The curry dishes we tried were heavenly, and most important they don't fake the heat. So if it says hot it is hot, and thats how I like it."}
{"text":"Great first time here for dinner last night. 

Atmosphere was relaxing and quiet. It was only about 4 or 5 tables since it was an hour from closing when we arrived. Service was average.

We started with the Toong Thong for appetizer (Ground chicken, potato, carrot and onion wrapped with rice paper skin slightly deep fried to golden brown, served with house sauce). Bf's first time having Thai food and he enjoyed this. 

I had the Tom Yum soup, which is a little off from what I'm used to but it was overloaded with mushrooms and had a little spice to it. Officially one of my new favorite soups!

He had the curry fried rice with chicken. Didn't expect it to be as spicy as it was, but it was still VERY good. I had a few bites and even though it was a little too much onions, we'd definitely order it again.

It was a late dinner so I didn't get a chance to order a couple more things to introduce him to, but we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Sa-Bai Thong more than 50 times in the past few years. I have never been disappointed by my dining experience, until yesterday. The usual salad was replaced by a bowl of chopped lettuce with very little dressing. The Ka-Rhee, a favorite, had a somewhat pasty sauce and tasted as if it had been reheated. The spring rolls, likewise, lacked freshness. 
 I will go back as I have many times before, but my faith was tested yesterday."}
{"text":"Missing on every level.

Service: Was seated by the kitchen where we were feeling a cold draft coming through on occasions. Left alone for long periods of time. Right at the beginning after being seated and throughout. With water glasses siting empty for far too long. But the waitress was nice thou. 

A HUGE pet peeve happened too. Hate, Hate, Hate it when they don't bring all the entrees out at the same time. There was at least 5 minutes between each time we got our entrees. I got mine first. So was about 15 + minute till the last one came out. Bad timing on kitchens part. Luckily mine were cold items. I personally don't like to start eating till everyone has their food. I find it rude.

Food: The Shrimp Purses were tiny and cute but nothing special. Tasted like bite size egg rolls. Papaya Salad was too sweet and vinegary with no hit of fish sauce or shrimp paste. Crying Tiger had tender beef stripes but no pizzaz.  Pad Thai was ok. Not to saucy but once again missing something. The curry special was the best thing of the night.  With huge tender chucks of chicken and a kicking good peanut curry sauce.

Heat Level: They hit right on target here. Where most place miss the mark for me. I wanted super hot and I got it. WIN. (cough, cough wheres my water!)

The food was forgettable,service was non existing and kitchen disorganized. Im going to say I will never be back to this location at least."}
{"text":"It was a rainy night. I wanted pad thai take-out and Sa-Bai Thong is just a couple miles down the road. Not amazing, but it's pad thai, so what do you expect. I thought their version was solid. Thanks, Sa-Bai Thong!"}
{"text":"Food quality was below average. Adventure spicy is less than medium. I has Tom ka soup and beef pad Thai. Would not recommend. Also, employees were having a meeting on how to use the credit card machine and 2 were being reprimanded for incorrect usage. Not appropriate when customers in lobby."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why great curry - or Thai food for that matter - is difficult to locate in a city like Madison.  Thai restaurants in the Madison area should be knocking it out of the park left and right.  Curry, with all its forms, is ubiquitous among menus of Thai restaurants and should be perfected with the same proficiency of an engineer at NASA performing basic mathematics.

Sadly, there are no such engineers at Sa-Bai Thong.  With a day off of work and a chance to frolic to a new lunch spot, I read up on Sa-Bai, and the reviews hyped them up so it was time to check them out.

They open at 11:00 AM on weekdays, so I chose an early lunch (11:15ish) to get ahead of the lunch crowd and provide the waitstaff ample time to impress me with their lunchtime prowess.

I love duck and ordered their roast duck curry.  Given the choice of cucumber salad or chicken soup, I chose the soup to chase away the fall chill.  I also added hot green tea and an egg roll, because, well, why not?

The egg roll came hot and ready.  It required the accompanying sweet and sour sauce to give it a major boost in the flavor department.  The green tea arrived with the egg roll.  It was scalding hot and needed a couple minutes to cool.  That was when I noticed the white serving plates and tea mugs were stained gray with age along their edges and brims and sported numerous scratches and chips.  Sipping from a chipped glass is not exactly enticing.  When in the hospitality business, this is a glaring red flag.

The soup arrived next and produced the second major red flag.  It had good flavor, but it arrived lukewarm, something taken very seriously during health department inspections.  Hot foods should be maintained no lower than 140 degrees for your safety.  Food poisoning is no fun.

Hoping to find solace in the curry, I was sorely disappointed at what arrived.  The bowl arrived with the same ugly spots as the others.  Though the presentation was honestly the best thing about the dish, its flavor was dismantled by the lack of items expected to be included int he dish, as described in the menu.

\"Red curry sauce with deep fried boneless roast duck, bamboo shoot, pineapple, green bean, squash, red pepper, tomato and basil.\"

First, \"deep fried\" also means they dip the duck in batter for whatever reason.  Again, not mentioned in the menu.  The batter on top remained crispy while the batter along the sides and bottom of the 3 decent pieces of duck were soggy, giving them the texture of wet bread.

Second, they left the layer of fat on the duck.  With the batter covering it, the fat layer never had a chance to become crispy.  The fat was loose and runny.

Third, not present were the green beans, squash, or the pineapple.  For some reason, these were replaced with green grapes.  If the promised ingredients were unavailable, surely the staff should have been aware of it, because the kitchen would have communicated it, right?  Something should have been mentioned upfront.  Besides, who puts grapes in curry?  It was weird.  I tried it, and did not like it.  To add insult to injury, the grape tomatoes and grapes were ice cold in the steaming hot curry, making for some very confused taste buds.

Fourth, when serving sizable pieces of protein, a serrated knife should be made available.  It was not.  I had to ask for a knife to cut the duck chunks.  I, in turn, was given a butter knife. 

I'm fairly tolerant of many things.  The duck curry was disappointing on so many levels that I did not even finish it.

So many red flags - under-cooked food, damaged/stained dishes, missing/phantom ingredients, confusing flavor/texture paradigms - the entire experience really impressed upon me that the place was poorly managed.  You can tell when a restaurant puts love and effort into cooking.  This was not one of those places by a long shot.  I will never return, and I urge anyone with yearnings of Thai cuisine to try another venue."}
{"text":"Loved the curry dishes we had and the peanut sauce with the satay was on point. Also tried the iced green tea...everything was absolutely delicious. I only gave 4 stars because I was with a large group and everyone's food came out at ridiculously different times. I believe it was 15 minutes from first dinner served until last dinner served."}
{"text":"Food - delicious, typical Thai food. I thought they should have given 3 people at least a bowl of rice for each person, instead they served just 1 plate of rice to have us share amongst each other, which was definitely not enough. The spiciness rating system I thought could be worded better. I ordered a dish that was 2 stars, which is described as careful, wasn't very spicy at all

Price - decent, $13-$15 for an entree with tips included

Service - what are all these reviews talking about? Service was pretty good if not very good. Waitresses are always paying attention to our table, so many of these reviews don't do them justice. Maybe they changed up the staff quite a bit

Overall - I'd be coming back if I wanted to try out some more Thai dishes and would order something 3 or 4 stars on the spiciness scale"}
{"text":"I've been searching for any decent Thai place in Madison and sadly this is not it. All I want is some good garlic chicken!! But they didn't offer that on their menu, instead I tried the Bamee Chao Nue lunch special. It did not have any Chinese broccoli or Napa cabbage in it as their online description states, unless is was so finely chopped that I wouldn't notice it. Just tasted like your run of the mill Chinese lo mein dish. The chicken tasted pre cooked and then reheated and tossed in. I won't be back.

Closest I've come to Good Thai in Madison is Ha Long Bay, and they're primarily Vietnamese! ;P"}
{"text":"Love dining here! The papaya salad and tom ka soup are delicious and are my favorites! The only recommendation I would suggest is that I wish they had Siracha sauce to add to the spring roll sauce.  This is the only South East Asian restaurant that I know of that doesn't provide that.  But that still doesn't deter me from eating here."}
{"text":"The food here is stupid good!  The thing is, sometimes the cook messes up your order, and that can be super disconcerting when you have an anaphylactic-grade food allergy. *Some may say I should just give up restaurants that serve my allergen altogether, but I say it's worth the risk to enjoy all that SE Asia has to offer.

Pro-tip: Come here early. Once they get crowded, the cook seems to get a bit overwhelmed. My boyfriend ordered a #31 with pork and was served something entirely different - not spicy in the slightest - with beef. I had some. It was not what he wanted. It was not even close.

The waitress warned him as she served him that it was the wrong meal, and offered to re-put the order in, but also followed that up by saying that it would take a long time, as the restaurant was filling up and the cook was busy. My poor guy was hungry, so he said it was fine.

Honestly, if a restaurant mixes up an order so badly that the server notices before she gets to the table, I would prefer that she take it back to the cook and FAST-TRACK that sh*t to get it right.

Nothing was knocked off the bill. There wasn't really any kind of apology, either. 

We WILL go back. Mostly because I friggin' love their noodles and curry. But I won't allow the wrong meal to be served again - I'll ask them to remake it, and you should too.

As far as parking, there's a shared lot that always has spots. If it's wintertime, bring a sweater or hoodie - it can be a bit drafty in spots."}
{"text":"They don't have the special lunch for pineapple fried rice anymore, and it sucks. but overall the foods are good, tasty and at okay price. the That iced tea is super good and I love the gradient color of it, must order drink here. I would say it's a good place for date or dinning place instead of Thai basil with good food but only for carry out or delivery."}
{"text":"The décor is modern and classy.  The food was fresh and delicious.  I found it to be not very spicy so you may need to ask if you are used to very spicy thai.  The service as very prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"I don't really understand the low star reviews, but I guess I've only dinned in once and every other time I've gotten take out. The one time I dinned in wasn't the best, but they were super busy so I wasn't sure how to feel. The take out has always been FANTASTIC. I've tried many of their curries and I've never really disliked any of them. I definitely think the place is over priced, but I crave this place too damn much and end up paying the prices. I always have left overs and end up needing extra rice. Usually I'll just make it at home myself when I'm heating up left overs the next day. The times I've gotten extra rice, it heated up pretty well when microwaved with the curry. I probably wouldn't dine in again, but I highly suggest take out."}
{"text":"Lunch here is a great option (although not a fast option if you dine-in). The food is great and was brought out soon after ordering. The atmosphere is probably the best part as it's decorated well and feels very \"home-y\" overall. 4 stars because the service was a little slow in ending the meal (checking if we needed boxes, running the card, etc.) I'll be back again for lunch I'm sure."}
{"text":"Yeah, I've been coming here for 20 years or so. My favorites are the Tom Ka, Tom Ka with noodles, and the Pad Thai. In fact I ate nothing but the Pad Thai for the first 15 years I went there. The Thai Iced Coffee is condensed milk and coffee, I wish I could get that to go in the morning. And don't forget to grab a handful of lemon drops on your way out. :)"}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoy eating at Sa-Bai Thong - though we often forget the name of it!  We've only been to the Odana rd. location, but we have gone about 4 times now and find the food delicious, the wait staff usually attentive, and the atmosphere relaxed.

I especially like the Tom-kha gai soup (the base is a chicken broth with coconut milk), which is a great warm-up on cold Wisconsin days!  I enjoy the Pad-Thai, a tasty comfort food which reminds me of a noodle casserole.  My son enjoys the vegetarian curries, and my daughter usually gets the chicken in peanut sauce - yum.

I recommend the Sa-Bai Thong restaurant if you're in the area and craving Thai food!"}
{"text":"Came with some WI pals, and this is their favorite Thai place.  Wait staff was friendly and very attentive, my shrimp pad Thai was very flavorful, and they let us stay sitting and chatting for almost an hour after our meal was completed.  I didn't have room for dessert - but the cupcakes looked fantastic!  Reasonably priced featured local wine as well."}
{"text":"If you need a Thai cuisine fix, this place will satisfy your cravings. I would say it's your average Americanized Thai restaurant with your standard pad thais (quite orange and sweet) and appetizer rolls. Nothing terribly special but still all right. 
I was pleasantly surprised by the noodle texture (springy, not mushy) but the sauce/flavor was a little standard.
For dishes that are meant to be spicy, you can get the spice level on a scale of \"tiny\" to \"adventure\"."}
{"text":"There are better, and cheaper, places for Thai food in Madison but you still can't go too far wrong here. The service is kinda shit though. I don't know if the waitstaff have fully mastered the English language because they fuck up special requests on the reg. I don't give a shit but my friends with dietary issues do (my bud with lactose intolerance had some rancid gas after eating one of the curries with cream in it). I recommend the squash curry. Pad See Ew is should have an emphasis on the \"Eww,\" as it was greasy and bland. If you sit in the back there is a great view of a pond

...and a dumpster : /"}
{"text":"Another failed attempt to find good Pad Thai in Madison. The summer rolls are good, but for the most part the food is bland. I eat thai food for the richness in flavors and the sauces here just don't cut it."}
{"text":"Was skeptical about getting asian food in a small town but was not disappointed!  Food was delicious.   Service was slow intially but definitely got better.  You can pick how spicy you want your dishes.  One of the best Thai restaurants I've been to in a long time.  I wish this place was in San Jose!  We also needed separate checks because for business expense, and this is the only restaurant where they not only divided the checks up for us but they divided equally each dish we ordered, which was nice!  Definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very good food!! authentic flavors and 
freshly made. Willing to modify a dish. Fast service & delivery always comes expediently & very hot."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Madison I was really excited to come to this restaurant because the man had hyped it up as a great Thai eatery.  When I finally visited the restaurant it definitely did not live up to the hype.

On the plus side the place is really nice and is a great place for dates and groups as it is very large.  However the food, as this is a restaurant, should also be great and unfortunately it was not.  I ordered a red curry dish which sounded great but was disappointed at first bite.  It's not that it was bad because it certainly wasn't but it just wasn't great.  There seemed to be something missing that I was not able to put my finger on.  The man ordered the pad Thai which he actually loved.  I didn't try any of it so I don't have anything to say about it.

As far as the presentation of the food however that was spot on.  I would recommend this place to anyone trying to venture out and try something different as the flavors are not in your face.  Also the staff was great and very attentive."}
{"text":"Compared to my regular thai food fix, in Chicago this place is good - not great.

The variety and flavor of the dishes is quite good but, the service is best described as random. Having to ask for chop sticks is just unacceptable.

As for the spice factor - adventure is not really spicy at all and should be noted in the ordering process. Also, beware the spring rolls."}
{"text":"Here I go again, singing the praises of Chicago food.

As someone who was spoiled by having every type of food at her fingertips for eight glorious years, I really missed good Thai when I moved to Madison. I had a beef Pad Si Ew hankering from hell one day, so we ordered Sa-Bai Thong. 

Thai food should be cheap (under $10) and delicious. This was mediocre and more pricy. The sauce was thick, bland and jelly like, and there was barely any beef. 

I have given this place another shot, ordering Pad Thai the second time, and it was no better. What kind of a Thai place can't make decent Pad Thai?!"}
{"text":"I think the curries here are pretty good but their other dishes were just average for me. I've tried a few of their Sa-Bai favorites and Sa-Bai specialties on different occasions, expecting them to be a little more traditionally Thai, but they've all fallen a little short of the mark for me. In my opinion, I think this place could benefit if they cut down the size of their menu, focusing on making a handful of popular dishes really, really well. Again, there's nothing wrong with this place for me--the service has always been friendly and prompt, for example--but it's just a little too pricey for what they're offering right now."}
{"text":"Jungle Curry was EXACTLY what I expected. Creamy hot red curry packed with veggies and tofu. Should have been a bit spicier to be considered truly authentic Thai. Yummy 'til the last bite."}
{"text":"There was a big hype about this restaurant but it didn't quite deliver. I ordered the volcano chicken and it tasted more like sweet and sour chicken. The pad thai was a-ok because the shrimp tasted really fishy. Also, it was a bit tough to eat. Overall, the meal tasted more like a leftover meal.

Service was great!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Thai restaurant in town! I've been searching for good thai food for sometime now, exploring my options from the wes side to Willy st and any in between, but I always return to this location for its consistency, flavor, and service.

I love the fact that their curry sauce is more thick like gravy than soupy. The portions are always generous and the pricing for lunch is perfect. My favorites is the red duck curry. 

Their space is nicely decorated by a variety of Thai souvenirs and the the noise level is quiet, great choice for professional lunches. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've had better Thai food, but their Crying Tiger, Laab, and \"traditional\" dishes (fried rice, pad thai, etc.) are pretty good. Haven't found a better alternative in the West Madison area."}
{"text":"I've gone here twice with a group of friends after shopping at the mall.  Both times all of us were disappointed with the flavors of the food.  On my recommendation we got the panang curry (normally my favorite everywhere else I go) but it was bland and full of huge apple chunks. I've never seen that anywhere before,  it barely had any veggies.  No carrots or potatoes or anything. And the portion was tiny for the cost.  The tom yum soup was ok but pretty sour and not very coconuty. I've had better Thai in Madison so I won't be back."}
{"text":"Driving through Madison and stopped here. We had the Masaman curry and Tom Kha soup. The food was delicious, the decor was tasteful, and the service was spot-on. Also, although we didn't try it, I noticed they serve organic wine!"}
{"text":"We tried the shrimp packets and red curry with chicken and they were both very tasty. The spice level in the curry was perfect for us (we like things spicy or medium spicy). Service was good and it was easy to get a table at lunch time on a Sunday. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Called my order in advance, confirmed it was the Odana location, they told me to wait 20 minutes when I got there they said they didn't have an order for me. I asked to speak to the manager and all they could say is sorry we don't have it. If you'd like to wait 20 minutes we can make you your dish. I explained that I am on my lunch break and cannot wait 20 minutes that is why I called ahead.  I ordered a salad and they didn't even offer that to me. You would expect a manager to say sorry we made a mistake on your order these are the options that we have for you right now or we can have your order delivered to you when it's ready."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. Best Thai restaurant in Madison area. Good food with affordable price. The crispy duck curry is my favorite and they have many delicious appetizer worth to try."}
{"text":"Ok, I checked in and we were seated about 5 minutes after entering the restaurant. We were given menus and then they didn't come back for 35 minutes. We ended up just leaving super hungry and a bit cranky. I think they were busier than they were expecting to be (due to the holiday and everyone not working on that day). What a huge bummer! I was so looking forward to their pad thai. I hear that it's delicious. Even though I'm super bummed, I will probably be back to try it out."}
{"text":"I have gone to Sa-Bai Thong many times. I love their vegetarian summer rolls. They are so tasty! They also have a lot of great vegetarian options. The only negative I will say is that for some reason when I get their food as take out, it doesnt taste as good. Plus when I ask for things to be made mild, they come extra spicy. Then the food is inedible. But when you eat in the restaurant everything comes out perfect and delicious."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and tried a few different items, including curries, tom yum soup, and the pad kee mao. The food does not taste fresh, and is surprisingly bland for Thai food. Nothing was particularly good, and the service is slow. If you forget to ask your waiter for something, be prepared to wait a good 10 minutes until they come around next (even when the place is not at all busy). They don't bring everyone's food at once and aren't attentive enough to refill water often.

Pretty disappointing overall, I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Sa-Bai Thong Thai Cuisine (6802 Odana Road, Madison, WI 53719).  This is the best Thai restaurant in town.  If you like Thai food this is the place to go.  The food is always fresh and we'll presented.  I especially like the variety of seafood, beef, chicken, and vegetable dishes.  Excellent monthly specials.  The selection of food is impressive and very tasty.  The spice levels are to taste and adjustable (Degree of spiciness: * Tiny ** Careful *** Adventure **** Fire). The restaurant is very clean with excellent lighting and a large number of booths and tables to select from.  The staff are very friendly and are very attentive to customer needs.  The price is fantastic with dinner at $12 to $18...WOW!  Bathrooms are clean and well maintained.  Has large room for large groups/parties.  Try this place and you will be a regular like I am.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  We had the Tom Kha soup with shrimp (our favorite Thai dish).  We were pleasantly surprised to see lots of shrimp in the dish and cooked perfectly (not over cooked as they often are).  They were very accommodating when we requested a side dish of steamed veggies (not on the menu).  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I know...every one has a different Favorite Thai restaurant.  This one just happens to be mine.  I don't think it is because it is largely better in any way, it us just within my neighborhood and I have a working knowledge of the menu.

My go to dish is the Yellow Curry with Chicken or Tofu.   But everything is tasty.  They are so good about mellowing out the spice level for this weakling.  During winter their soup keeps me from getting a stuffy nose.

I think I am ordering from here tomorrow...."}
{"text":"Go here at least once a month for lunch. The food is delicious, only drawback is the service is slow. But the people are friendly and the food is the best Thai in Madison."}
{"text":"I have never left a bad review before, but wow, that food was terrible! I don't know what that was, but it was not Thai food."}
{"text":"I just love their pad Thai and pa neang curry. For appetizer try their tofu summer roll. I have been here multiple times and this place has never disappointed me. Sometimes I become adventurous and order them spicy but if you are not a spice loving person don't go there."}
{"text":"Really appreciate the gluten free options! Staff and atmosphere are pleasant. Enjoyed the Mus Mun Chicken and Thai Iced Tea."}
{"text":"The food here is authentic and delicious. The thing I love most is that they use lime and fresh cilantro is many of their dishes. I would say this is the best Thai food I've ever had. Service was also pretty great both times I've been."}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot. So much so the staff recognized us upon entry. There food and service were always good. However recently the prices, portion sizes, and flavor have not been up to par. It is a nicer Thai restaurant in the area with a cozy, inviting dining area. But the prices for what you get just aren't worth it anymore.

I used to get their Pad Thai which I used to enjoy but I've found a better place that is more tasty. I like my pad thai a little dryer. The pad thai here is more saucy and the noodles more slippery. We also enjoy many of their appetizers: crab rangoon, shrimp purse, Ming sabai, egg rolls, etc. There is also a noodle dish my husband and I both enjoy. It has wider rice noodles with a darker sauce and Thai basil. We ordered here a couple months ago to try it again and our usual Thai place is much better, significantly cheaper, and larger portions.

If you looking for a nicer dine-in place then its a good place to go. But we prefer other Thai restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Extensive menu with options galore. Wonderful ambiance. Pleasant staff and priced well. Side note: personally, I like my Thai \"hot\". I recommend the **** fire for those with a love for tabasco level heat.  Thank you Flora."}
