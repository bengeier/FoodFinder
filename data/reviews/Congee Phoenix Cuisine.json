{"text":"Very nice congee place, good value, nice environment and well-priced. Tea is really good for the price tag they have on their menu. Only complain I have is the washroom is really really cold... :P"}
{"text":"I like this place better than Congee Queen. More upscale - huge chandeliers and fireplace make this a great dinner setting. And because of the size and noise level, you can come on a date. There are private booths for 2-4 people as well as group seating. We like their deep fried tofu and we think that their congee is richer than Congee Queen's. They have a wide array of selections in their menu. There is limited parking, so come early or come late. They share the lot with Tim Hortons, but as we were told, we shouldn't be parking at the Tim Horton's side."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out for delivery at 4pm in a sunny weekday. however the guy arrived almost an hour later. I lived only 20min local drive from this restaurant. Whats worse, The plastic bag was a mess, full of soybean sauce and oil, one dish box was broken. The delivery guy purposely hide the bag behind him when I paid so I didn't  see such mess and he still got his tip!   Plus, they increased the price.   Will not order from this place again."}
{"text":"The good: decor is nice. As someone else pointed out, it's similar to Asian Legend with lots of modern-ish dark wood and rich, dark colours. On closer inspection, it's not as nice as AL, but it's nice enough.   The ok: food was ok. The pea sprouts were decent and so was the congee. However the servers recommended two dishes (fried squid and some variation of honey beef) that were really disappointing. One was overly salty and the other was just bad white-washed asian food typical of a mall food court.   Service is quick, but a little pushy. They try to up sell constantly. We were asked if we wanted lobster in English twice. When we said no, another server came by to ask in Chinese. I'm happy to hear the specials, but it felt very forced. Despite our request to recommend more vegetable based dishes, the servers pushed meat dishes (the two rather blah ones I listed earlier).   A rather mediocre experience."}
{"text":"Food is average for Chinese food. The service inside the restaurant was decent for my one time dining in experience. The interior design is decent. However, you may want to bring a friend that speaks Mandarin as English and Cantonese is not their strong suit. Also, the delivery today was horrible as they didn't include napkins and hot sauce. Previously, another order they mixed up a few of the dishes. When we called back in each case, they didn't care at all! They have lost our business!"}
{"text":"Happened up on this restaurant and thought I'd give it a try.  I usually go to Congee Queen or Wong so thought this would be good for comparison.  On entering there is the large lobster tank that is an eye sore and needs some upkeep.  This was unwelcoming and I hesitated giving the place a second thought.  Decided to proceed through.  We were seated immediately and service was attentive.  We had the Shrimp and Scallop congee - shrimp and scallop limited but the flavor was good.  Also had the Beef with rice noodle in black bean sauce - Good enough flavor.  Ma Po Tofu on rice - good.  Overall the taste was good but the servings were smaller than what you receive at the above mentioned restaurants.  If you want to pay cash you let them know prior to the bill and there will be a 10% discount.  Overall the place was just OK.  I would not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"The worst Chinese restaurant ever! Even Mandarin Buffet tastes better than this place! With disgusting Meat Sauce Lo Mein that they serve and Microwaved BBQ Pork & Duck rice, come in 5 tiny pieces of each costed $8.50!!! Totally overpriced! Definitely not coming back here again, since it's my first time and it's my last time too!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best and service is terrible (and I speak Chinese). It serves my favourite type of foods and has been one of my regular lunch spots (both take out and sit in) as my office is next door.  I have been tolerating it until today. After waiting for over 20 minutes, I asked the cashier to check. He yelled at the other waitress to go pack it, without even looking up. The other servers all have similar expressionless attitude. It looks like I will have to drive to Canton Kitchen on Sheppard & Pharmacy or Congee Queen on Steeles & 404. Both serve very similar foods at similar prices and are much friendlier, more efficient."}
{"text":"Years back, this building was a Keg Steak House!  Then it was \"Last Harry's Restaurant.\" After that it was called \"Red Rock\" which was a Rock 'N' Roll kinda Bar. (That one was my personal favorite!) Times change....and now it's Congee Phoenix, and I hope it stays Congee Phoenix. Their menu is extensive, with hundreds of dishes to choose from! Their Chicken and/or Beef with Noodle dishes are delicious. You get a lot of food for the money. The interior decor is really sharp and tasteful. I'm not a Congee expert, and I know ppl love Congee Wong, but my Ex-GF and I really like this place. We find ourselves going back time and again!  Try it, you may love it too!   ****NOTE: SADLY, this place has been CLOSED since the Summer of 2016. I saw a guy working on the Roof's ventilation system.**** THIS PLACE IS NOW A SEAFOOD RESTAURANT CALLED THE CAPTAIN'S CATCH."}
{"text":"I went there first time with my boyfriend, caz i saw the review is good. So i trust it! The food is so far so good, but the service made us feel disappointed! There is a service machine on the table, but no matter how many times you press the machine , nobody came to  serve you. In order word, the machine  is useless!  So I just give them 2/5."}
{"text":"Out of all the Congee XYZ brands, this one is my favourite. The location is on Sheppard right by Fairview mall, next door to Tim Hortons. It used to be an old Red Lobster and Jap/Korean AYCE restaurant called Momiji. The restaurant is very clean and modern looking.   The prices are fair like any other congee restaurant except you get fast service. The portions are fair and there's lots of parking at this location.   You won't see any lineups as the restaurant can seat a stadium.  Definitely recommended and convenient if you are looking for quick noodles or congee."}
{"text":"This restaurant has increasingly been my fam's go to restaurant immediately after any vacation - fresh off the airport. It's close to where I live and relatively quiet. I just came back from Scandinavia and Russia so I was deeply missing cheap Chinese food. There is only so much Smorgasbord and Pickled Herring one can eat on a daily basis...  Food here is salty, bland, and cheap. Staff here have permanent frowns. No notepads here; All orders are taken on Hello Kitty iPads. But after two weeks of not eating Congee or Wonton Noodles, it certainly gave me my fix.  I wouldn't come here any other time though."}
{"text":"This place has good food but not very good food that I could order all the time. I did order few times since there was nothing good in the area. Ordered sirloin black pepper fried rice with chicken chilly. The lady taking the order is hard to explain the menu to. Overall average."}
{"text":"My SO and i eat here biweekly. Quality hasnt changed. decent portions."}
{"text":"The food was really good and was largely portioned. The service was \"ok\". They were quick getting the food out and taking my order and then I don't know what happened to my waitress. One of the guys cleaning up the tables noticed I wanted to get going. He got me a carry out box for my leftovers and then he was the one who brought my bill when I asked him."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. The place was quite full. We ordered a big bowl of seafood congee, eel fried rice, singapore style turnip patties and 1 fried dough stick. The congee was flavourful with a decent amount of seafood. The eel rice was ok, decent flavour and size. Dough stick was re-fried ok. The turnip patties were a huge disappointment. They just added some shredded chicken and green onion. There was no extra curry flavour or colour, just tasted like regular turnip patties.  Overall, not bad, but I don't think I'd return. Rather drive back to Markham to eat.  Bad parking situation here."}
{"text":"Congee Phoenix Cuisine is the typical Cantonese restaurant that you would expect to find in Toronto. But, this restaurant is quite different from the many related restaurants that I have visited in my life.   The ambiance of this restaurant is warm and light with the various color scheme and decor around this restaurant.   The food at this restaurant is exactly the type of flavour you would expect to taste if you went to any restaurant in Hong Kong. The food is quite delicious with its numerous selections ranging from congee, chow mein, fried noodles, and various Cantonese dishes. The prices are quite standard compared to nearby Cantonese restaurants.   The service was all right as the waiters were very friendly and polite. Although they did not know much English, their willingness to satisfy my family was quite admirable.   Congee Phoenix Cuisine is not your ordinary Cantonese style restaurant and I do recommend to anyone looking for some good Cantonese food to check out this place."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a regular weekday night. and i've been here for a while. I remember when it first opened it was packed, and with good reason, it was very good place food wise, and the price was good. I believe that it has decreased in quality over time. It is still a decent joint in terms of taste and quality, but with the constant price increase and the availability of other congee places nearby i'm not sure how relevant this place is.   now onto the food. I ordered the bbq meats which is a standard for all congee places. for congee phoenix this is actually relatively new, as they did not offer this before. the two meats were roasted duck, and bbq pork. and i have to say that neither was good. Although the portions were good sized, the falvour just isn't. The duck was soft skin and fat, it just seemed really salty. and the bbq pork was dry and overcooked. Overall i was very disappointed in it.   We had also ordered the dry beef fried noodle. which is a stape for all congee places, and cantonese cuisine places. The flavour for this was okay. it was not bad, it was not great. it just seemed to be fairly standard fair. and did not wow me. Overall i feel that this restaurant did not have the quality it was known for before. and did not really have the value either it had before.   Although not a bad restaurant, i would not recommend this place to other people, as their are plenty of other congee places a short drive from there, that are better and better priced. Unless they return to form and become back what they used to be, i feel this place is forever on my list of restaurants i only go , if i'm close by or if someone brings me here."}
{"text":"We went on a saturday night around 9pm.  The place was relatively quiet.  The restaurant was very modern and was quite comfortable.  The food (we had the congee and fried tofu) was what is expected of a typical chinese restaurant.  It definitely fulfilled our congee cravings and would recommend it if in the area for congee."}
{"text":"I have seriously experienced better.  Had:  Baked pork chop rice ($7.50) - Cheese is an extra $0.50. I didn't add it. Portion was decent. Pork chop was tender and juicy. Fried rice base was good. Moist for a fried rice though. Sauce...wow...I've never had tomato sauce on a baked pork chop rice like this. It was wow, but not in a good way. It was super sweet (in a cloying way), and sour too. Most Chinese tomato sauces taste like ketchup that's been thinned out, then thickened with cornstarch and water. This one tasted like they had super concentrated ketchup. I wanted another entire plate of just plain fried rice so that I could make that sauce less concentrated.  Shredded pork chow mein ($8.25) - Not particularly appetizing looking. We asked for our noodles extra crispy. There was very little of it that was extra crispy. The rest was soggy because of the sauce. I expect this from my $3.99 Chinese food court chow mein. I expect more if I'm being charged double that.  Fried vermicelli in home style ($8.25) - Decent amount of topping/filling/non-noodle stuff. Liked how they used red onion instead of regular onion. Lots of green onions. Decent amount of shrimp. Noodle base wasn't that great. Didn't have that lovely chew I'm accustomed to. Vermicelli usually has a springy texture. This was kinda limp. Also lacked that slightly toasty noodle feeling (I'll explain in overall comment).  Overall Comment:  Not enough wok heat. Nothing was hot enough. This is very important for Chinese food. If they had had enough wok heat, their fried rice would have been less moist, their chow mein would have been crispier and their vermicelli would have had more slightly darker, almost toasty burnt marks on it.  Interesting thing to note:  They have tables with seating on three sides. Interesting concept. Not sure how well it works with the condiments on the table.  Caution:  Winter. Mats outside of the main entrance don't have salt on them. Slippery. BAD.  Final remark:  This place made me appreciate much more how I have a Congee Queen close to home."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Congee Phoenix as it was close to where I live and the interior actually was modern-ish sorta like Asian Legend. Congee was actually decent and service was ok-ish but upon taking some leftovers home, we found a huge blue elastic band at the bottom of the congee, as well as a long piece of hair. EW!!  We suspect it was a hair band or something, needless to say, we'll continue to make the trek to Market Village for Congee."}
{"text":"We went there when they just opened. On average once/month. Have tried many of their dishes. To be honest, all the similar/ regular dishes for this type of congee/Cantonese restaurants, Congee Wong is definitely much better in terms of authenticity, flavor and portion.  But we keep coming back for their salted-egg yolk coated shrimp (without shell, therefore more flavorful), and signature pork ribs. Please give them a try! Their Chinese roast duck and pork are also better than Congee Wong.  Today we ordered our regulars, but the fried rice was rough and bland and lack of that yellow color which I guess from the touch of curry powder. Xia men style fried vermicelli was bland too. The Xia men vermicelli was one of my favorite HK dishes for almost two decades, today it lacked the sweet & sour sauce that also gives the dish their unique red color.  Anyway it's a 3.5, gave it 4 since the overall review was a bit low (3 stars)."}
{"text":"Very close my home.I went there on Tuesday afternoon wasn`t busy,Food was so so... but service was poor, staff was no kindly and no smile on faces. It was a long wait time to ask staff to come to order."}
{"text":"So so, but seems always busy. The parking lot is really limited comparing the restaurant size and the amount of people."}
{"text":"I came here around 2pm today. I decided to visit because I've passed by many times and \"it seem\" busy from the outside from the time it opened.  Now I think about it I think it's because of Tim Hortons next door...  The décor = 4 The food = 2 Service = 3  I was really disappointed.  I thought it would be better or same at least as the other Congee chains.  Ordered the following - Fried Shrimp Wontons...reminded me of chicken balls (English style). Stuffed Eggplant  Fried Chili Turnip Minced Pork & Fried Eggplant Cantonese Chow Mein  Everything was bland and under seasoned."}
{"text":"I've only come to this restaurant during lunch time, so I can't say for dinner, but I do see special set dinner combos for two, four and more. I'm thinking of giving it a try sometime.  I've tried...   - fried turnip (side dish) cake... ok... I've had better tasting ones elsewhere, but it does have the nice crispy texture on the outside and soft on the inside.  - stir-fried shrimp noodle with egg (thick flat rice noodles)... 1st time I tried it it seems tasteless in comparison to other popular joints, but then I like it because I don't like my food too salty.  - deep fried pork chop rice in pepper sauce... first time I had it I thought it was really good. Very peppery with a nice kick, second time around, wasn't as peppery. Overall sauce is not too salty either.  I'm likely to keep coming back to try other dishes. I like that they serve real Chinese tea, not the cheap stuff. If there is any MSG, is very low as I tend to get very thirsty after eating out at most Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Holy mackerel batman! The family styled servings are well cooked and seasoned, satisfying and I absolutely loved the variety.  Had white people safe Chinese dishes, but I am counting the days to return to try the seafood dishes!  On a serious note, the fried rice was a delicacy, the General Tso chicken was outstanding and the dish of greens satisfied the others."}
{"text":"Located right next to Tim Horton's on Sheppard, this is a decent place for a quick lunch. I had only 30 min to eat something and this did the trick. The interior decor is pretty nice and was pretty clean. The prices were also inexpensive - a bowl of wonton soup will set you back $4.50.  There were maybe 6 shrimp wontons in my soup, and the wrapper was thin and delicate. The one downside was that I found a piece of hair in the middle of one of the dumplings, right as I was finishing up the soup, which was pretty gross. I thought they might comp my soup or give me a little something extra for finding \"a little something extra\" in the soup, but I got 10% off my bill.  I also ordered the shrimp in rice noodle, which was $3.95 - I thought this was just okay. The rice wrapper was too thick and not super flavorful. I would pass on this one.  I don't think I'd come back here again, unless I was in a hurry and needed to get a quick lunch. I'll stick to the noodle soups and congees, since it seems like those are their specialities."}
{"text":"Overall, a nice congee place. The menu has a huge selection and can be overwhelming at first, but the prices are cheap and the food is tasty."}
{"text":"So after a series of bad restaurants that have inhabited this very spot, I've been very reluctant to give Congee Phoenix a try.  However, I've recently decided to put my big girl pants on and go and try it out...andddddd...I'm sort of sad I put all that effort into it.   I tried the preserved egg & pork congee, chinese donut, and a chicken flat noodle (ho fun) dish.  Everything was just very bleh and bland.  I feel like their sole type of spice they used was really, just salt.  I've had way better congee than and even if the price were right, I really don't think I'd be going back again."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place 2-3 times a month for the last 6 months. Cheap!! The portion used to be good but is getting smaller these days.Much smaller than their competitor \"Congee Quxxn\". This place Congee Pheonix has nice decor,very  dirty washroom, unfriendly staff except the hostess at the front. Last couple set dinner for $138 was a disappointment. Twin lobsters was canner size, the manager always try to upsell bigger size lobsters and look pissed if you won't go for it,  steamed chicken tough, snow pea leaves with mushroom was so small you will think its a half order. The seafood egg drop soup was so salty we have to return it which we think they poured all the bowls of soup together and add more water then served back to us. we knew it because it was so watery when it came back from the kitchen. The staff never change your plates even when they are full of bones and shells. Absouitely terrible service.  We won't go back  to this place again. The other congee place at Don Mills and Steeles is much more superior in food quality, service  and cleanliness. ."}
{"text":"Congee places aren't usually on my list of  places to critique but as a person who's gone to this place on a somewhat frequent basis, I'm happy to say that it's a place (for now) I'll continue to go.  The decor, for starters is pretty nice.  It's bright, vibrant and offers a complete view of the entire dining floor.  It looks like it can seat a lot of people but they've placed their tables where potential traffic jams wouldn't happen.  It's a rather smart table setup that they have there.    Service, on the multiple times I've been, they've been pretty nice, patient and very accommodating (especially in the times I've gone as a large group, they would be willing to split the bill multiple ways without issue).  They bring the food in a timely fashion and always seem like they're in control (you never seem to see any of the waitresses get overwhelmed or stressed out).    Food, for the most part is pretty solid.  Some of the stuff we ordered ranges from duck congee, seafood congee, fried turnip cake and deep fried squid.  While their menu might not have the range and variety like other congee places, I don't recall a dish that I've ordered that was below average.  Not to mention the dishes are reasonably (again, I don't go to millions of congee places, but $6.99 for sweet and sour chicken for a generous portion, is rather reasonable).  None of the congees that I've had consisted of that horrid MSG taste, that lingers even after the meal and they've included a good amount of seafood or duck (depending on what congee was ordered).  One of my fav dishes, and a dish I'll continue to order is their Salt&Pepper squid.  Typically, in a lot of congee places, or the ones that I recall, the squid is tough and the yummy seasoning is pretty much an afterthought, but Phoenix manages to perfectly cook their squid, and it's rather light (not heavy in grease).  My only complaint?  I don't think they put enough on the plate.  I kind of think that they skimped on the portion there...but meh...plenty of other food that my friends and I were enjoying.  It's a solid place to go get your congee fix, but just be aware (while this isn't much a restaurant can do about this, but I find parking and access here is kind of a nightmare), but it's a good place for congee in my books!"}
{"text":"The decor is nice and the restaurant seems clean. It certainly has potential to have higher stars. However, the food was a little disappointing! Everytime a dish came, I would compare it with Congee Queen or Congee Wong's food. Nothing was impressive nor memorable.  Most of the dishes were quite bland. We ordered a vermicelli singapore noodles dish but it was so dry. The congee was bland but at least it had an acceptable amount of ingredients in it. The Unagi fried rice only had small bits of Unagi in it and was also bland. Maybe I should have stayed home...Maybe the restaurant should be renamed Congee Bland?   It took a while to get the bill as they were a bit busy."}
{"text":"Not bad for a congee joint at all.  First of, the location is cursed. Businesses have opened and close here every year.  Congee Phoenix is the newest addition.  After being only open for a month, it was surprisingly packed. And packed full of Asian people so you know the food has to be authentic. The interior is quite nice from the regular congee places i've been to. The prices are in line with what other's offer (i.e really cheap). The service is horrible if you don't speak chinese.  All in all, i'm impressed by this congee location. I hope it stands the test of time."}
{"text":"Not bad, the food was meh and pretty largely portioned.   We ordered an eel fried rice and although it certainly had the eel fried rice taste, I could not find any big enough piece of eel to even recognize.. looked like all meager tiny unrecognizable scraps of eel mixed in there.   Also, the parking kind of sucks here. Probably wouldn't come unless I was stranded at Fairview and REALLY wanted some congee-type food within walking distance."}
{"text":"We, party of 8, came here for lunch today (Saturday). To park your car at this place can be a little frustrating because this place is shared with Tim Horton's.   The food arrived very quickly.  The congee here is delicious, the clam is not over cooked and the thick consistency so tasty!  Fried dough is a lot better than Congee Queen and my party seems to really enjoy the pig liver dish. Salmon fried rice was damn good, the caviar compliments the dish and the garnish they put is so refreshing!  Steamed fish was extremely tender therefor it is not over cooked. Their famous spare ribs is the best spare ribs I ever had!  Tasty as hell!!!  What I don't like is that they don't clear out empty dishes and don't refill teas. Other than that we really enjoy the experience here and we will definitely come back.   Food:  5/5 Ambience:  4/5 Service:  3.5/5 Cleanliness:  4/5"}
{"text":"I know it is a little unfair to rate a brand new restaurant just based on 1 dish.  But if this dish is a simple dish that is available in almost every congee/noodle restaurants even in a food court and is a comfort dish...   Congee Phoenix Cuisine really fell short.  The price definitely is good. $4.50 for a bowl of Shrimp and Mushroom Dumpling Noodle Soup. The size was perfect for a light lunch.  The dumplings though was the worse I ever ate. The tiny small shrimps were so mushy and have this really funny taste. I forced myself to eat as many of those as I can, as there was only 4 in an order... but I just could not finish it!  The staff are all really new and eager to help, but I feel uncomfortable when they all staring as the customers while we eat..   Decoration is really nice.   Congee Phoenix does has potential. But they really needs to work on their quality of their food first.  Menu is really uninspiring just like any other congee place..."}
{"text":"This is a lovely restaurant that offers Chinese fusion food. I definitely would recommend the fried squid, spicy turnip cake and a very authentic Cantonese chow mein dish. These were our groups favourite when we went earlier this month!   Definitely will go back to enjoy the cuisine. On top of that, it is very competitively priced in the Chinese food restaurant list. Though, they do have a hard time understanding English."}
{"text":"First off, the restaurant is very nice inside.    The decor and ambiance is very nice.  i'll give it maybe a 4.3 out of 5.  quite empty on a weds 7pm dinner service.. only half the restaurant full.   Now comes the food part.  Selection was quite poor compared to any other congee restaurant such as congee queen, congee time, mr. congee or even keungs.  the menu has only the basics.  So if you are adventurous or looking for something different than congee time.  This is not the place for you.  I got the shrimp and scallop congee.  It was a big disappointment.  all 3 of my guest, all Chinese were surprised at how pastey the congee was (very starchy.  Its simply not really restaurant quality at least not up to par with others. The congee also had very little scallops and shrimp.    The rest of the meal was so so... we ordered a noodle dish which was sub par and \"foot lo chow fan\" their house special fried rice which was quite a disappointment.  Since normally this dish is made with egg whites only.  I think the chef made a mistake.  FOOD overall 2/5  Just not up to par with the others...   I see this place closing down in about a year and half."}
