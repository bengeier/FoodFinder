{"text":"Good food! All you can eat is awesome and prepared only once you order! My one year old loved it too!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place at an affordable rate. We went there last night  and thought it was terrific. We will definitely be returning soon.Loved the idea of ALL YOU CAN EAT in one price."}
{"text":"I like the way their all-you-can-eat lunch is brought out as you order rather than sitting out as a buffet. However, the menu  was quite limited, the service was slow, and there was a dirty napkin on my chair when they seated us. They never took it away, we had to ditch it on another table. For the price, the food and value is much better at other Indian restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"Finally, an Indian restaurant where I don't have to drive 20 minutes to satisfy my cravings. Located by Maryland and Silverado Ranch, a few doors down from Cici pizza, this place is huge and very clean. Better yet, the food was surprisingly good. We went for the lunch buffet. Don't let their buffet style confuse you, it was also new to me. They bring out the items on the menu as you order them. So it's kind of like \"Tapas\" style dinning rather than a buffet bar where you scoop up your own servings. I actually kind of like this style as I didn't over eat and yet I was fully satisfied. All the curries were delish and spicy and they have my favorite desserts too. Meal includes naan. Bring a friend, heck invite all your friends. The lunch buffet was a decent price of $11.99. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Visited this place yesteday for their lunch buffet and very satisfied with their food. My first time to have an indian food and definitely very satisfying.  Will try the dinner menu next time.."}
{"text":"Unbelievable sauces, nice people, realistic pricing.  Had the paneer tika masala, zafrani rice & garlic naan.  Not too spicy.  You can ask for less or more heat.  Wow, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great New Hot spot in town ,  Night out with  Friends or good times with Family. Enjoy a Amazing meal together. Staff is very Friendly with Great  Customer Service . We love the Vegetarian menu options. This was our first time trying Indian food but not our last. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed Armaan! It was quiet and nice. My wife had the Chicken Kourma. It was a little too spicy for her. They serve everything at medium spice but told us we could ask for less spicy next time. Good to know. I had the Assorted Tandoori which was amazing!! The naan we ordered was very good too. We'll go back. Great service and equally good food."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, they have custom menus everything changes and many choices to make.The girls in customer service were very friendly and I will definitely being going back again."}
{"text":"We went for the AYCE lunch with a group of 12. All the dishes were delicious! It took a long time to get everyone's food out as everything is made to order. We just shared each dish as it came out. The chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, chicken saag and Karahi chicken were amazing! The vegetarian dishes were very good and the naan and rice are awesome. Make sure you have time to sit for a while and enjoy everything. It was a great dining experience and everyone left full and happy!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Vegas. I have lived in Vegas for 6yrs and this is the best Indian food by far. Their Chicken Tikka Masala is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Wow, great Indian food! The Lobster Masala tasted very delicious and is my new favorite dish that I have ever tried at an Indian Restaurant. Some of my family is Indian and this is our new favorite Indian spot to go to when we go out for dinner with the family. There is nothing more authentic than the food served here, and the place looks great too! Looking forward to my next delicious meal here! A++"}
{"text":"Updated: First I have to say this is the best, authentic Northern Indian food I have had in Las Vegas.  The only issues I have are they do not serve Indian beer. You can order Modelo but not Taj Mahal.  And the ambience needs some attention.  By the third time we went back we found they now are playing very pleasant Indian background music.  It really makes a difference.  Still no Taj but the food, in my opinion, is still the best Indian in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Love all the foods served last night especially the mango and strawberry lassi...yum...been to all kinds of Indian restaurants so far this is the best one ive been to so as the service and the location...everything was just great...i like the decors and the ambiance of the place being there was just giving me the feel at home vibes...thank u for the wonderful service...we will surely go back...great place to have parties and events it's very clean and wide space for dancing and games...."}
{"text":"First time here over the weekend. Was amazed how they do their AYCE. Its made when you order so all dishes comes out HOT and fresh! The waitress that afternoon was very friendly and constantly came by to make sure everything was okay and if you needed to add any more items.  There is a wide selection of curries and items. I really enjoyed the chicken masala, it was full of flavors and chicken was moist!!!! Lamb was great as well. They come in these small dishes, so you can try other items too and not be full after eating one dish. I was not to impress with their shirmp curry, it had flavor but it was not like the others.  I would love to come back and try their other items on the menu.  Try it out!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food and amazing staff. We had Naan, Garlic Naan, Lamb Biryani, Palak Paneer, Green Chutney and Achaar followed by Gulab Jamun and Badami Kheer. All was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Good authentic food. Worth the wait to cook it. The owner came by to check on us more than once. Clean and open. We will come back."}
{"text":"So I went here to try out what I thought was going to be a typical buffet style lunch. I was a little skeptical when the hostess handed me a small menu to order from. It seemed like a small selection and many items I don't normally order. That being said I took a chance and just ordered some different things and wow the food is great and tasted excellent. What's nice is because they are making it when you order is you can add a little spice to the dishes if you like. Excellent food and value. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Tried Armaan for the first time today. I ordered the chicken tiki masala for $15.95. My order was Togo. Two stars because the food was way over priced for the amount they give. It was only enough for myself alone and I am 98 pounds. It didn't even include rice."}
{"text":"First time here and will be my last. Figured I'd try the place out since it's new and I love Indian food. After waiting for almost ten minutes to be seated in an empty restaurant I knew by things weren't looking good. Finally seated and placed my order which included Lobster Masala (most expensive item on the menu at $25) and was told it would take awhile to make. Fine, it sounded like something worth waiting for. Twenty five minutes later \"IT\" comes out. Draped in sauce to hide the fact that it's not done. How hard is it to cook lobster???? You can visibly tell when it's done and when it isn't done. I ate my bread and appetizers and paid for the meal. The kicker is the hostess asked me if I wanted a discount for the undercooked lobster. If you have to ask, then you don't care about your mistakes. Take care of your customers and they will take care of you. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. Amazing flavors and truly leaves the palate happy. It's a clean, decent sized restaurant. The reason I'm giving them only 4 stars is because the service was super slow. They had only one server working and before we even sat down we asked how fast the food normally comes out since it is all you can eat style and we were told 5 to 10 minutes. We waited over 30 minutes for the food to come out. Again it was well worth the wait but just make sure you are not in a hurry to get somewhere after. Also, lunch price is very reasonable and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"This food sucks.. girl said Marsala ck was the best thing she has ever tasted and it was nasty.. ththey charge you $5.99 if you wana add rice! This place will not last more then 6 months. Days later we have been running to the bathroom.."}
{"text":"They have not fully opened yet let me lead with that. The menu was pretty small due to the soft opening. We had the Tika masala and samasoas. The samasoas were crispy and fragrant and very filling. The chicken tika was nicely marinated and came out super quick. They also brought out an order of the onion rings complimentary for us to try. Honestly they was on the mediocre side all things considered. Service was great and I'm sure the food will improve once the restruant fully opens."}
{"text":"Came during the weekend lunch buffet and food is served in adequate portions. Food is tasty and served hot and fresh and price is reasonable too. This will become our spot for now on. Eggplant and lentil dishes are mild spicy but our favorite."}
{"text":"We had the AYCE. Fantastic quality,and service. We have now put this as one of our regular spots to eat weekly. $12.95 for AYCE is great deal.  Also the owner was so nice and treated us great!"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite go-to spot for Indian food. The restaurant is very spacious and the staff are very friendly and attentive. The all you can eat menu (I love that everything is made fresh for AYCE here) is a little small but that's a good thing since it includes everyone's favorites. A lot of parking space available outside and easy to find even though they're sign outside could be bigger or lit at night. The food was delicious. The recipes are within family and handed down from generations. Definitely coming back here. The price was also amazing for the quality of the food along with the service. Our drinks never fell below half way even when the restaurant got a little busier throughout the night."}
{"text":"Noticed this place by the Starbucks I go to all the time and decided to give it a try since my wife and I love Indian food. We came here for lunch which is all you can eat expecting a long buffet table with steel old food sitting on it like most places. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that the all you can eat dishes were all cooked fresh as you order them so when the dishes came out they all tasted open much higher premium quality.  We had a chance to speak to the owner and if you ever meet him you'll agree he is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. Every person who worked here was very warm and friendly!  The food seriously tasted great and getting seconds or thirds is welcomed. We left here stuffed and can't wait to come back again!  Update: Went back 3 more times unfortunately the standards kept going down and the portions are now so small it's just 2 bites before you have to keep reordering which gets awkward and they make you feel a little uncomfortable. Our family has started going back to Taj Palace on Eastern it's consistently good there and better atmosphere. Sorry I really tried to like this place and as you can see highly recommended it when they first opened..."}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian food. Very nice family run business. Lunch buffet is an incredible deal. All the dishes are prepared fresh. This is by far my favorite Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"We love coming here for lunch when the Indian food craving hits. They freshly make small portions of tasty Masala, basmati rice, and Daal, all you can eat style. Wonderful oven baked Naan. And the mushroom matar is my favorite thing to order there. The flavor is amazing. Some of the food can run a little spicy so let them know if your sensitive to spicy. Great place to eat. Nice owners and servers. Love eating here."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last night and was handed the all you can eat dinner menu.  I thought it was at the buffet area, which was dark, but the woman explained that all food is made to order in the kitchen rather than sitting in pans on a buffet.  I ordered:  Papadi chaat Onion pakora Chili chicken Tadaka daal  Matar mushroom Baigan bharta Badami kheer Gulab jamun  The standout dishes were the chaat, chili chicken, and tadaka daal.  The chaat was made with chick peas, pieces of finely chopped potato, tomatoes, and flour crisps.  When I've had chaat before, it generally had rice crisps.  These were flour and were just as good.  The chili chicken had a very nice spice tang to it as did almost all the dishes I tried.  The baigan bharta is roasted eggplant cooked with spices in peanut seasoned coconut sauce.  The two desserts--kheer and gulab jamun-- were standard for Indian restaurants.   I like the fact that the servings are small dishes so you can try different things.  I wish there was more of a selection but I understand they have to limit it because of cooking time.    I was the only one in the restaurant when I arrived a little after 5.  Later, two other parties came in but it was a slow night while I was there.  You can also order from the regular menu but the server assumed I'd want the AYCE option which is available only on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.  Note--there was a sign on the door that they would be closing Tuesdays starting March 6.  For $14.02, including tax, this was a good meal.  That price also included the mango lassi.  It's an inexpensive dinner and a good one.  I need gto go back and get something from their standard menu."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding! They have only been open for a few months and hopefully will grow their clientele. It is a very large space and never very full. Lunch and a couple of evenings they have All you can eat. But there is no buffet with over cooked food. You order and they bring it to you fresh, as many dishes as you want.  We are pleased that they turned down the sound on their TV's and now sometimes have pleasant Indian music playing."}
{"text":"Everything is alacart here. I got butter chicken (not on the menu), garlic naan, and rice.   Butter chicken comes in a small bowl. It looks small but there was actually a lot of chicken and a lot of sauce. Butter chicken is not on the menu. But t he e price was $14.95.the curry was perfectly spiced and chicken was very tender.  Garlic naan had chunks of garlic in there. It was so fresh and crispy. Dip this with the rice and garlic and make it into a taco is what I did.   There wasn't many people in there when I went but it's a pretty big space. Very clean and very spacious.  If you like Indian food I would definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"Armaan was quite a surprise! Large open dining area, super cool AYCE concept where you pay $11.95 and order fresh dishes specifically made for you, not the traditional Indian lunch buffet. The service was good, not amazing, but no complaints really. The food was also good, not Oh my God like some of the Indian food I've had in Vegas. I will be back for sure! The price is good and I like that the tapas sized foods are at an AYCE price. Suuuuuper good naan, like fluffy & crunchy at the same time -yum! Their chili chicken was really delicious. Their palak paneer surprised me. It was not made how I like it. It was almost like a thing of frozen spinach with cheese blocks, I was expecting what I normally get all warm and very creamy. Otherwise, everything else was good! I will be back to try the dinner next."}
{"text":"I will keep it quick and simple. No good. Food had no flavor or spice. For Indian food, flavor and spice is most essential. This place had neither."}
{"text":"So delicious. Had lunch here. $11.95 for all you can eat but not buffet style. Everything was super tasty and delicious. So happy to have a good Indian place nearby."}
{"text":"My family and I came in last night and we probably won't return until they have a full staff on hand. Let me start off by saying, the owner and his wife are wonderful. We were welcomed in as if we were joining them for dinner at their home; however, we were seated for over 30 minutes before my mom had to ask if we could order appetizers and just get our check. Apparently there's miscommunication between the wife and husband, while both of them kept passing our table, they both thought the other was tending to us, and turned out neither of them had. We brought our samosas home to have at a later time which were delicious, and I hope one day to return and taste more of their dishes."}
{"text":"I would easily give this disgrace of an Indian restaurant a 0 out of 5 rating, but unfortunately Yelp doesn't currently support that.   My dad had suggested this restaurant during our family trip to Las Vegas due to the positive reviews from \"customers\". However, I immediately had a sinking feeling when we entered the restaurant and noticed that the place was empty. Completely silent! In fact, there was not even a worker or owner present until my uncle whistled, prompting the owner to rush towards us and seated us. After he seated us, I waited a few minutes, and when water didn't show, I felt annoyed that I had to ask for water. It's a restaurant, Jesus Christ ! In addition, I noticed the lack of papadum and the various chutneys I was familiar with receiving at every Indian restaurant I had ever been too. However, I forgave this as maybe things are not the same in Vegas as Los Angeles. On the topic of service, every single item we ordered took absurdly long to prepare, considering we were the ONLY customers present. In fact, one of my uncles had specially ordered a Chana masala without onion and garlic because he doesn't eat that. The item didn't even show up until the rest of us had almost finished eating.   Service aside, let's move on to the most important part: quality of food. The vegetable Pakora, the first appetizer, was literally a cauliflower fried in unseasoned batter which was disgusting. Hell, anyone could make better pakoras than what was prepared by Armaan Taste of India. On some pieces, I could see the raw cauliflower which had none of the flavorless batter. Unappetizing much? I decided to clear my mind; perhaps the main dishes would be somewhat decent. Oh boy, was I wrong! The paneer tikka masala tasted like someone had dumped heaps of tomato paste, tomato purée, and chunks of tomato, with sugar and small sprinkles of Indian spices. This was despite my request for extremely spicy paneer tikka masala. The malai kofta gravy tasted like raw sewage diluted with turmeric and chilly power. By far, the most disgusting dish. The channa masala which my uncle had ordered looked like little shit pieces in brown gravy. The next morning, my uncle said he threw up all of the disgusting channa masala.   I presume the high ratings are from non-Indians who don't know how delicious Indian food can be when prepared properly. To you, I suggest visiting restaurants recommended by any Indians you may know. Once you visit a proper Indian restaurant, you will agree with my review and agree with how an abomination of a restaurant Armaan Taste of India is."}
{"text":"BS+++  Want authentic Indian food? Looking for curry and something vegan? Just want to chill with cool peeps in a nice set-up? Come visit this place.  I tried the garlic naan, chicken marsala, the palak paneer, the lamb, the goat, and the bomb a$$ mushroom!!!  I heard this week there is a special chef from NYC.  I would visit it this week of December 2017.  Try the lamb it's AMAZING!  Spicy! Yummy! drooling and sweating.  This place is clean and very hospitable.  It feels like home.  It's family owned and family ran.  The chef is a young new chef (20 yrs old).  I am pretty impress.  Come try it out and you won't be disappointed.  COME TONIGHT and again and again!!  Food is BOMB Restrooms are CLEAN Tables CLEAN Table wait time QUICK Take out wait time is QUICK Customer service is GREAT Ambiance FANCY Kitchen SUPER CLEAN  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage).  Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday.  We're used to the typical buffet style Indian restaurant. They dont have that.  It's All You Can Eat off of a menu which has most dishes you find at any Indian restaurant.  You order whatever you want and they bring it in small portions enough for 2-3 people. The food was definitely fresher and tastier than the other place we normally go to and tue beat part was everything is fresh made to order unlike other places that have food sitting out under warmers.  One TIP YOU NEED TO FOLLOW WHEN EATING HERE...**Order everything you want to try at the beginning!!!** We made the mistake of placing our orders at different times and our 2nd order took 20 minutes.  By that time our stomachs had settled and were full.  Definitely try the rice pudding.  It was also better than what we normally get at the other place on Eastern.  Its topped with almond slivers but I think they should also top with coconut.  Overall they get 4 stars.  Took off 1 star over the long wait.  I honestly thought we were getting a whole tilapia with how long the wait was... we got 4 strips. lol"}
{"text":"The only major draw for me here is they have an AYCE buffet every Monday for CHEAP!  If you do come, don't expect any stellar service. Both times I've been, the waitresses were lagging on refill service. It is summer. So guests are hungry. No matter what size glass you give to the guest, a refill is still a refill.  Also, another con to this place is you basically get \"nickle and dime\"-d. Side sauces like the tamarind sauce, cilantro sauce and raita where you normally get for free at 90% of other Indian restaurants, here you get charged for it. Being in the business, I get where their mentality stems from, but to actually experience it as a paying guest, I abstain from enjoying these condiments here.   Food is nothing to brag about, but for price and convenience of this place being closer than MOST Indian restaurants that I would normally visit, I would still come back.  Hey, cheap eats is cheap eats. As long as they keep up the gulab jamon filled, I'll always consider this place!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! I came here with my boyfriend and they seem to still be fairly new. There were only 2 servers and they had a big party of 10, along with a few 2 and 4 top tables.   Since there were only 2 servers, the service was kinda slow but they were doing their best so I can't really complain but they are understaffed. We also noticed the party of 10 was giving them a hard time and in my opinion being dicks. Anyway....when the food finally came out, everything was DELICIOUS. We ordered the all you can eat lunch and had the Makhani Daal (lentils), Matar Mushroom, and garlic naan. Our server first only gave us 2 orders of Makhani Daal and we had to ask her to bring ring the mushroom dish but she never did. We told the second server and she told the kitchen and they brought it out 10 minutes later.  The food is great, however if they will need to be fully staffed in order to gain repeat customers."}
{"text":"Chicken Tikka Masala was bland and swimming in clarified butter. The rice was good as was the garlic naan. This was my first time here so I tried a si.ple dish to see what they were like. I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place as I love Indian food and was excited to have a new place opening up in the neighborhood.   I arrived and there was only one table of 3 in the restaurant plus myself dining alone. I ordered the signature lamb shank from the menu.   It took 45 minutes for my entree to arrive and it was cold, tough and tasteless. For close to $25 for the entree it was a disappointment   I wanted to give them a shot but clearly they are struggling with just opening   I might try them again in the future but quite honestly there are several more Indian restaurants in town that are much tastier and worth it."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here today and had a wonderful experience.  Was greeted right away and handed a menu - we were planning on the AYCE buffet but did not see it set up anywhere so we started picking items to start.  Karen, our waitress, told us that the 'buffet' was order as you go - this was awesome because everything came out hot and fresh and was shareable by our whole group (3 total).   We were able to pass dishes around with ease so it was like our own family style buffet.   Karen walked us through some options and we started with our fan favorite: Chicken Tikka Masala.  The sauce was flavorful and delicious, we ended up getting 3 helpings of it.  We also tried the Goat Roganjosh which reminded me of a pot roast, very tender meat.  My unexpected favorite was the Chicken Saag - I have never had it before but now I will make sure to order it every time.  We also tried the naan, Makhani Daal and a roasted eggplant puree with spices but I cant remember the name of it.   All the food was well balanced with spices and flavor and the owner and staff were all really friendly.  I love supporting local businesses and if you are in the mood for great Indian food, I would definitely suggest it!  They also offer takeout which I may take advantage of during the work week but their AYCE offer is a hell of a deal."}
{"text":"This place instead of having a buffet will serve you as much as you want from a list of options. Chana masala is excellent. Chili chicken is delicious. Naan is standard, just okay. Chef by special requests made me whole wheat Puri. A little heavy but very good. Palaak paneer creamy but has a strange spice added. Service is top notch. No papadum."}
{"text":"Friendly service by the owners and EXCELLENT food. The food was worth the wait. We had chicken tika masala and goat roganjosh."}
{"text":"Wanna try good Indian good. This is the place. Armaan taste of India!!! Friendly staff. Good service."}
{"text":"Interesting concept as it has an ala carte all you can eat special. Some of the best Indian food I've had stateside.  Not too spicy either and the bread could not be more fresh. The only criticism is that the sign of the place is hard to read at night."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants. This place has ridiculously amazing food! If you like seasoned freshly made Indian food, you can't miss this place."}
{"text":"The best thing I ate today was their cauliflower appetizer. It was absolutely delicious. Love it and would come back just for that. We got the tiki masala and was not impressed. It had a good level of spice but still tasted like something was missing. When we ate the tandoori chicken, flavor was half there and it was very dry, also tasted like there was no salt. The chai tea and lassi were decent. I have had better Indian food."}
{"text":"I arrived to the restaurant at 8:55 pm not knowing it closed at 9:00 pm, however, Mo, the owner, welcomed us in and invited us to take a seat. The restaurant is airy, new and you will never feel claustrophobic.   They have a all you can eat special where everything is cooked to order. The food is fresh, flavorful and authentic. The owner surprised us with a complimentary order of onion rings and the Indian tamarind sauce. Very nice touch.   I was blown away with the taste, presentation and attention to detail. I will highly recommend you pay a visit to this new restaurant and offer Mo the opportunity to delight your palate with the authentic taste of India."}
{"text":"Give it a try, this place definitely deserves your patronage. Food is good, not too spicy, and its very laid back,"}
{"text":"LOVED this place! Great ambiance, great food and very good service. Definitely a place to frequent! Lamb chops and goat were delicious! Must try!"}
{"text":"Came in on a rainy afternoon which is rare in Vegas. The place was empty as expected. Las vegans are not use to rain(lol) the waitress was so elated that she has someone she can served. Another lady came and said hello and introduced us to how their AYCE work. We ordered goat curry, chicken curry tandoori chicken( a little too dry to my taste) and eggplant.  The food taste good and the spices are just about right to my palate.  The desert is good, gulab jamun and the rice pudding which I sent back to the kitchen initially, came back as to what I expected. The price is Fair and the servings are generous. The plus side is the place does not have the normal smell of an indian buffet restaurant cause the food are coming from the kitchen instead of the normal buffet counter. I can come back again but won't crave for it."}
{"text":"Yummy Indian food.  Love the garlic Naan bread! Good ambiance ! Friendly staff. Will recommend!"}
