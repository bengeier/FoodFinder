{"text":"Ever since my favourite go-to shawarma place (literally called The Best Shawarma) closed down a few years back, I've been searching for a replacement ever since. And I think I may have just found it here! 

We ordered both the mixed shawarma wraps and falafel wrap. It was delicious! The wraps were very filling and juicy, and the falafel was moist which was also very nice! It's very rare to find a place that can serve both very well.

Ali - you are right! We will definitely be back!!!  :)"}
{"text":"Great place and agree wholeheartedly with Rueben except with the 'quick service' part.
I have been going for years now....since they opened, as Eglinton Square Mall is right in my neighbourhood.  My only complaint is the VERY SLOW service I receive every time I have gone or my husband has gone for take out.
We were just talking about this tonight (hubby and I) and said we didn't know who was slower in serving their customers----Ruby's or Island Foods....my gosh, you wait forever.  Food is worth it though but don't go if you're in a rush!!"}
{"text":"Luckily this place is right by my workplace and I go there regularly. The chicken shawarma plate is what I usually get and it is awesome! Large portions of great food at reasonable prices...definitely worth checking out. 

Who would've thought that one of the best shawarma places in Scarborough is at a mall food court..."}
{"text":"Not the best shawarma in Toronto, better than the one across the street, it passes for a shawarma, and its pretty filling but, SUPER SLOW SERVICE. If you're in a rush don't bother.. Try McDonald's lol"}
{"text":"Placed a fairly large order for a group. Included a combination of chicken and mixed shawarma plates. Service was quick and efficient. The plates had generous helpings of rice, salad, dressing, hummus, potatoes, chicken and beef. All tasted good."}
{"text":"Shawarma sandwich is really good, however there are other local places just as good that offer a much bigger sandwich for the same if not less money. If I'm at the mall and need to eat ASAP I'll go here but it's not my first choice"}
{"text":"Shawarma really isn't hard to make...why do so many places mess it up? Rubys is one place that does NOT disappoint when it comes to shawarma in Scarborough!!!! I have been going here since they opened and I have been satisfied every time. (Being Lebanese I am very picky with my shawarma)

They use chicken breast unlike other places that use more fatty chicken cuts. This makes their shawarma far from greasy just like it should be! 

Their food is consistently good and that is key in the restaurant business

Their service speed has always been average, I never felt they were too slow like other reviews mentioned

Their prices are very average 

They are veryyyyy clean and use gloves and hairnets.

Tip: Add tabouli to your chicken shawarma sandwich mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"This place has started cutting back on the staples that made it great. Now, items like tabouli, a main ingredient in a chicken Shawarma are no longer offered, or sometimes can appear from the back kitchen at an added cost as a \"side dish\".( the owner said that it has become too expensive to serve!) I hear people asking for it when I am there in line but the owner just ignores their comments. Very annoying after supporting him build up his business by telling friends and family. Two star rating for poor judgement with his valued customers!"}
{"text":"The food here is FANTASTIC!!!!

The meat melts in your mouth, and has a flavour like no other. It spins on three spits, and is mouthwatering to watch! Very high grade halal meat.

The veggies are fresh, crispy, sweet, and have defined colour.

They offer a variety of other Mediterranean and middle eastern snacks and deserts. The spinach and cheese swirled phyllo pies make a tasty and filling snack.

The service is fairly quick, unless you want wings, which is an extra 15 minutes. The wings are very meaty, high grade, and quite reasonably priced!

One person complained about them being too slow. You don't want to rush quality like this. The speed is just fine. I've never had an issue.

I have a lot of health problems, and reactions to a lot of food, and is food is very healthy and easy to digest.

High grade product and fair pricing are the reason I eat here every other day. The business is clearly run quite well. 

Definitely recommend - 5/5"}
{"text":"For a food court, the food is delicious and fresh. I love the choice of salads and condiments. It is one of the only healthy lunch options at Eglington Square Mall and the ingredients are not processed."}
{"text":"I'll go ahead and bump this up to a 5. If it's the best food court Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food I've probably had - why not? Frankly, it's better than 90% of other comparable places at this price range too.

Apart from what I mentioned in my earlier review, their meat quality is fantastic; I've had both the chicken and beef which are shaved fresh off the spit to order. I've heard others say the fish is very good too.

They offer a large selection of sides. Even if some are probably not that traditional - such as a mixed bean salad, they're still high quality and work perfectly fine with the meal IMO.

Very busy place, and clearly many others recognise their quality, though they keep the line moving well. Quite possibly the best thing at Eglinton Square mall."}
{"text":"The place is in a food court inside One Eglinton Square and the place is filled considering its a Thursday night albeit with old people. 

I ordered Falafel platter ($8.99 before tax) since I feel like eating veggie and yes they serve one of those better Falafels. The balls itself is huge and tasty. You also got to choose a side of your choice, beans in my case; and hummus, both which are good. You get pita as well which is a good compliment to the powerful tasting balls."}
{"text":"Ruby's Mediterranean Cuisine was heaven four months ago and still is today! Honestly in love with this place, my favourite place to come eat. Wraps, plates, soups, poutine is all good!"}
{"text":"It's in a food court mall so it's not gourmet but it's a meal that will fill you up without leaving a hole in your pocket.

The other times we've been here it's usually all guys working (4star food); it's a Wednesday afternoon, women are preparing and serving the food and the difference is definitely noticeable (5 star food). Shawarma was tender, juicy and flavorful. We had the garlic potatoes and pasta salad which were both tasty. 

Good choice if you're at the food court and want a change of pace from the usual fast food offerings."}
{"text":"This place has really good shawarma, I actually end up ordering from here pretty frequently because of how good it is. My favourite is the chicken shawarma plate with coleslaw and pasta, you're gonna love it!! Also the workers here are very friendly"}
{"text":"I'm just going to get it out of the way upfront - this is located in a mall (Parkway) and in the food court.  Yup...tucked away in a corner is this gem.  After a long day of doing errands, I needed something in this mall and was debating if I should pick up some fast food or if I could  make it home without dying of hunger.  

I decided I needed to get something to eat before leaving and decided to give this place a try based on yelp reviews.  Not disappointed in the least!  YUM

I ordered the beef shawarma - you it with rice and 2 salads (i got the bean salad and just a green salad).  Then you add the sauces, (make sure to say yes to the hot sauce!).  It's moist and tender and the flavours just melt into your mouth.

For me the portion size was really good - had enough left over for lunch the next day - and it tasted even better!

It is a bit pricey for a mall food court, but so so worth it."}
{"text":"Best place to grab a lunch inside the mall. Owners are very friendly and all the workers are really nice. Highly recommend it. Also they have a combo special - 7 bucks for shawarma , fries or potatoes and a drink ."}
{"text":"My favourite shawarmas in Scarborough!

Ruby's is located in the food court at Eglinton Square, right next to the library. I've been going here for years and although prices have gone up, the ingredients have remained fresh and high quality. The service is always friendly as well. Love that they add radish, it gives an extra crunch to their shawarmas!

I've tried fish, chicken, falafel, and beef. My go-to shawarmas are usually chicken or falafel. They shave the meat right off when you order, then they warm the shawarma up for you in the oven. The meat is so flavourful and juicy! I've also tried the plates but I usually get the combo which is beef/chicken shawarma wrap with fries and pop. The fries are crispy and come with an amazing dip. Every bite is delicious here!"}
{"text":"Some of the best falafel I've had. Soft with crispy outside. This is the place to be in this food court. 

Great customer service. Very friendly. Seemed like a family run business. 

Food was great. They give generous amounts of food. With the falafel plate I got a choice of any two sides. There was a very generous amount of hummus which tasted really good. Pita was fresh. Even after an hour the falafel balls were still nice and soft. Sometimes when you leave them too long they become hard and dry. Tahini and hot sauce tasted good. Loved the hot sauce. Wasn't spicy at all when eating it with the food but the flavour was absolutely delicious. 

They also had shawarmas which seemed really popular. I would definitely come back here. I highly recommend the falafel plate to any vegetarians out there!"}
{"text":"Food court place. It's totally worth it. Very generous with the portions. I got the chicken platter and it was filling!!! Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Healthy alternative to take out.  Portions are huge. Food is delicious. It is best to take out the mall food court tends to be very loud."}
{"text":"Great tasting shawarmas. There's limited choices in the food court and I usually end up coming here since their food is made fresh."}
{"text":"I went here based on the reviews, as I would never have though to go there, located in a food court in a tiny mall.  I had the shawarma plate, which was shawarma on rice, with two side salads.  I had the beet salad, and the coleslaw.  Everything was great.  The shawarma was topped with tahini and hot sauce.  Service was efficient and very friendly.  In my opinion the best shawarma in the area, and trust me, there are quite a few.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"They have the best food and customer service. They put a lot on your plate/wrap but you'll still finish it because it's so good."}
