{"text":"Their food is amazing here. Their steak, egg and cheese hoagies are really good. Their sweet hot wing sauce is awesome too."}
{"text":"Good service moderate price. Try the pizza did not like the pasta"}
{"text":"Papa Rocks delivers delicious hot food AND beer right to my house. For that they will always hold a special place in my heart. They have great burgers and sandwiches and we really like their battered fries. Lots of great beer selections. 4 stars because dine in service always leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"Awful. I have tried multiple times over the years to give this place a chance. Every time it has been a major disappointment. First time, I got a pizza that was burned and instead of cooking it correctly, they melted more cheese on top to try hiding the burnt cheese. It didn't work. Tasted like garbage. Second time (years later) I decided to forego the terrible pizza and get a steak sub. While it tasted ok (not great) it gave me the poops all night. Third time, I went only because friends were going. I ordered nachos, thinking surely they can't screw up nachos. They waited too long to serve it and the chips became soggy and gross from the cheese. Those are my experiences.  The place is also a little stinky inside. Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza,  promptly delivered, and friendly service!  I'm happy to report that the pizzas had a table life of about one hour :-)"}
{"text":"I was going to leave a positive review, buffet was decent for 12 bucks, then I see either a cook/ dishwasher come out to the buffet and grab wings to eat with his bare hands, wtf that's gross and there are tongs right there. Place is still dirty as F"}
{"text":"Don't order anything fried and you'll be ok, especially during lent. Everything from the fryer tastes like fish marinated grease. I don't think they change the oil enough because everything from the fryer tasted burnt even though it wasn't. We've ordered a few times with the same result.  The pizza is consistently good though! They have great soft pretzel sticks and hoagies as well. And, if you drink beer, they are one of the only local places that will deliver beer to your door."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  We moved into the area a year ago, and knew someone that worked at Dom's down the road, so we had gotten into the habit of going there.  Someone recommended their subs to us though, so we figured we'd give the place a try.  The subs were good, I think I had my hopes up since the person that recommended them gave them a stellar review.  I mean they were pretty good, but I was pumped up to have the best sub of my life.  I'd say they were a bit above average for a pizza shop, and of course a lot better than Subway, but I've had better at many sub shops.  As for the pizza, we were hoping we didn't make a mistake by going here, but the pizza was pretty good.  I'd say it's just as good as Dom's.  The only drawback is that it's a few dollars more for a pizza here.  So I feel like if there were no Dom's, I'd probably be a regular customer, but since it's very similar and more money, Dom's wins out slightly."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good and I come here often. It kind of taste like it's been cooked on a fire. Mega yum my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I don't think I ever ordered anything I didn't enjoys. Toppings are a little pricey tbh. They have some really good specials including on Mondays a pizza and wing buffet."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie: I'm not a fan of pizza. I was born and raised in Chicago, and I don't like pizza. It's a conspiracy, I know.  All kidding aside, pizza from Papa Rocks was amazing. I ordered an XL Traditional Round white pizza - half mushroom, half thinly sliced tomatoes. It was incredible. After two, big slices, I was stuffed. I tried to eat more, but I could hardly breathe so I knew that was a good stopping point.  Again, as a person who's not a fan of pizza, I was shocked to find a pizza place that had me wanting more."}
{"text":"Super steak hoagie is really good! Every time my brother is in town he orders one. Nice bar area too!"}
{"text":"Don't eat the fish & mac'n cheese. Fish had no flavor & was flat & thin. Mac'n cheese didn't have much flavor either. Noodles were stuck together & the cheese was gross."}
{"text":"The pizza here is some of the best I have ever had.  All the other food is really great too.  I have never been disappointed.  I don't understand the negative review.  None of it is true.  If they would just kick the smokers outside where they belong, this place would be perfect."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN!! First of all you seat yourself, which isn't a problem but it becomes a problem when the place is half empty and there a no clean tables and the waitress are sitting eating theirselves. Second, my pizza wasn't cooked thoroughly. The dough was nowhere near done.  When we brought to their attention she act as if that wasn't a problem. I'm shocked this place is still even in business. Save your money, save your time. Your better off going to Dominoes."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I struggled between three or four stars. I settled on four stars because of the quality of food. I have eaten here probably 10 to 15 times and to be quite honest I have not been disappointed yet.    Their pizza is very good and they have quite a variety on the menu. Their hoagies, especially the steak and cheese hoagie, are very good as well. The only downside to this place is the bar. They have only two or three beers on draft and the rest come in a bottle.  Also, it is very smoky. You will leave that bar smelling like an ashtray.  All in all, if you're looking for pretty good bar food at a decent price I would recommend this place. You shouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Open late night on a Saturday after a concert in Greensburg on our way home.   We had the whole dining room to ourselves and I enjoyed it.   The service was great. The food was even better!!  Pizza & a beer with an Italian hoagie to split.  I did down load the restaurant app   Highly recommended!! We will return!!"}
{"text":"I wish we could do half stars, because this is more like a 3.5. I really love the wings at papa rocks. It is hard for this Buffalo girl to find decent wings in Pittsburgh, but papa rocks pleases my palate.  They are a nice size, will make them crispy and their sauce is tasty.  They also serve them with celery and blue cheese which is almost impossible to find in Pittsburgh. They have variety in their pizza.  The one I really like is their Silician style because it reminds me of my pizza from back in Buffalo - kind of an in between version of Chicago and New York style. We've also ordered catering from them for my husband's birthday.  Everyone enjoyed the food and the portion sizes were generous.  The down side with catering is that they don't deliver catering orders, so you need to pick up that food yourself. The reason I downgrade some is that service and order accuracy are a crap shoot.  There are times when everything is perfect and timely, others when it seems nothing in my order is right.  Sometimes they are apologetic about their mistakes, but sometimes they act as if it is a major inconvenience for them to correct their error.  I'll keep going back because I really do love their wings.  I just wish they were better at customer service and order accuracy."}
{"text":"I've been here on two occasions. Once was late in the afternoon, way after the lunch time. The other was right in the middle of the lunch rush. Place is clean, staff is friendly, food is good and inexpensive. The atmosphere could use a little updating, but overall, not a bad stop!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The company I work for is not located far, so delivery is offered. I've made the mistake of trying this place 3x and all of them, I was disappointed. Over priced, small portions and never once was my delivery order accurate. Every time something was wrong or just not included, or it would be cold from taking so long to delver, and then as an apology, they mail me a $5.00 off your next order coupon. There will be NO next order."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill so much!!! Stay away!  And this is coming from someone who has 24 check ins here!!! Food quality has dropped off dramatically.... Burnt pizza, orders wrong, and inconsiderate staff. It took 80 minutes for our food to come tonight, I had to ask 4 times for a water, 3 times for the celery that I ordered, was charged for, and still never got, 30 minutes to bring out check??? And then when you bring it it's all on one??? You asked us, twice actually if it was all together or separate. Someone might think this is harsh but this the last straw. Save your money and go elsewhere!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for Monday night wings and the penguins game. Good friendly service and good wings. The kitchen is clean and the whole atmosphere is friendly. Food coming out looked and smelled good too."}
{"text":"I used to really like coming to this place; but after my experience tonight, I may not be back.  The restaurant seems to be severely understaffed since it took almost an hour to get our food.  I do love their wings with death sauce, but I cannot justify waiting an hour for my food when there are so many other pizza places in the area.  Come on Papa Rocks!"}
{"text":"Came to this place with a coupon I received in the mail. Ordered a large spicy sausage pizza. I have to say I am more than pleased! It was so tasty and delicious and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Several of us have been meeting monthly at Papa Rocks for lunch. Food is always good and it's a laid back restaurant. We brainstormed and thought that a mini high school class reunion would be fun. After talking about where to hold it, we had an Aha moment!  Here. Let's have it here!  What a success. The party room was available on the night we wanted it. We talked to Bob and said we wanted a casual evening. Cocktails, eat whenever folks were hungry, some music and a good time. Some folks were interested in dinners like spaghetti with a nice salad, pizza, etc. A few of us just wanted to snack so we collectively ordered wings, Godfather and steak hoagies and pizza bread with hot sausage and pepperoni. The kitchen graciously cut the food into \"finger food\". Perfect pairing for the wine and beer.    Sonia, our server, did a wonderful job keeping us all happy with the drink orders and the food. She handled the mini banquet room proficiently and professionally and ensured everything came out perfectly.   Thanks to Bob, Sonia and the kitchen staff. A great time was had by all.  Kudos."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that is near and dear to my heart. The first time I ever ate at Papa Rocks, I was about 7 years old and I loved it. To this day (16 years later), I still love their food.  Their wings are great and so is the service. Christina is the best of the best!"}
{"text":"Always my go to bar! Friendly bartenders! Delicious food, specials every day, two happy hours!"}
{"text":"It is not often that I give a 1 star rating, but my experience tonight at Papa Rocks is deserving. My family has been coming here off and on for years. We've always found the environment a little dingy, but the pizza was good. I ordered a pizza for my family tonight, and was shocked at what I witnessed!   The cook, the hostess said his name was Chris, reached down with his bare hands, picked some of the topping off and popped it into his mouth. He than whipped his hands on his pants, and continued to cut our pizza. I know this was mine, as I watched them finish boxing it up and bring it to me.   Needless to say I was, and still am, furious! What makes it worse was that I waited for the GM for 10 minutes, and he never came out. At this point the  hostess told me he was on the phone, and wouldn't be able to come out.   This has been the worst customer service that I have recieved in a very long time. It became painlessly obvious that they do not care about their customers dinning experience, or the health and well being of their customers.  I will never go back!"}
