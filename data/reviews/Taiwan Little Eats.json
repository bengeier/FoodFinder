{"text":"Decent prices for street food. The seating area is somewhat limited during peak dining times. It really irks me when groups of people come in and snag a table before ordering despite the long line. The seating issue would probably be better if they had a rule to order before sitting. 

Pork bowl was really good. Coffin toast is cute, but I was expecting a more robust flavor. Squid balls are a nice side."}
{"text":"We came with a Taiwanese friend here for the first time.  We ordered milk bubble tea, popcorn chicken, fried chicken cutlet and pork rib bento box. They are all delicious and taste like what we had in Taiwan.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"First Taiwanese restaurant in Madison.  Surprisingly it was good.  The food was not Americanized.  It was made to the original taste of Taiwanese food.   I love their fried chicken fillet. The bubble tea was good.  Their tea was not as sweet as Kong Fu tea (healthier). The black tapioca ball was chewy and  it was just right.  People were very friendly.  They came out to chat to us. 

We ordered the food at the cashier and put away our dishes when we were done.  Love this place. Definitely I am going back."}
{"text":"We are visiting Madison  and stumbled onto this little place. A great find! Braised pork  and charcoal grilled chicken  cutlet  both great.  Just  a tad greasy. Good  portion for the price."}
{"text":"Great tea and snack location! We ordered a bubble-tea, popcorn chicken, taro-wheels, and cold noodles. We came here after racing the local 70.3 (second dinner! :) )Everything was really tasty and it felt like we were back in Kaohsiung, although the cold noodles were just a touch too sweet for our palettes. Nice and comfy ambience and friendly staff. We would definitely come-back."}
{"text":"We popped in on a Sunday afternoon to check this place out, and we were not disappointed. The ambiance is warm, vibrant, and well decorated. I normally don't notice these things, but Taiwan Little Eats' atmosphere stuck out to me in a comforting kind of way.

We had the crispy and salty popcorn chicken, which was a little salty for me, but the name should've been enough of an indicator ¯\_(?)_/¯ However, I'll be back for the Taiwanese milk tea; this was my winner, as it was satisfying and not too sweet. 

Some of the menu items are still not available, but I would still recommend checking this place out for some tea or a snack as it's a great addition to the State Street food scene!"}
{"text":"The milk tea drinks at this place are excellent! The flavors are well balanced and you can really taste the tea without being overwhelmed by added sugar. I've been here a few times in the past couple of months and here are the food items I've tried:

- Crispy and salty popcorn chicken: Delicious, hot and definitely salty. Very crispy coating and the dark meat is juicy.
- Tempura fish cakes: Really good flavor and the texture of the fish cake is soft. I just wish they'd had more 
- Fried chicken cutlet over rice: The taste of the chicken is very similar to the popcorn chicken, so no complaints there! The veggies that they add are pretty lackluster. The broccoli/tiny portions of shredded carrot I had was overcooked (probably steamed) and soggy.
- Black pepper beef over rice: Meat was excellent and savory but, again, the rest of the fixings (miscellaneous veggies) kind of ruined the meal. 

Overall the menu is tasty but I'd say skip the big eats since the markup isn't worth what you get. The decor is simple if not a bit tacky, but there's lots of seating options and the place is open and clean"}
{"text":"I live just up the street from this place and I had just moved to Madison from California when I saw signs that a Taiwanese place was opening on State. It seemed like a sign that maybe this place could become a home and I was eager to try it when it opened. I had the popcorn chicken a couple weeks after the place opened and was pretty impressed. I had made sure to keep my expectations low since my mom is Taiwanese and I've been back a couple times and had pretty delicious street food from night markets. The breading on the popcorn chicken was perfect, the meat itself was moist, and it was seasoned well. 

I went back about a month later with my partner, who has never tried Taiwanese food. I ordered a tea egg for us to share, he ordered the popcorn chicken bowl, and I got the braised pork bowl for myself. The tea egg was okay, not nearly as flavorful as the kind my grandma makes (but maybe that seems like an unrealistic standard to compare this to?). The bowls were really yummy -- both our meats were well-cooked and flavorful, the pickles veggies had just the right punch, the broccoli was steamed well, and the rice not too soft, not too hard. Overall, it was a really satisfying meal. I even sent a picture to my mother and she approved. My partner really enjoyed it too - he sent me a picture of him eating there without me a week after we went! I'm pleased to have a place serving Taiwanese comfort food just down the street and I'm excited to come back and try their boba milk tea."}
{"text":"Simply put, this place serves the best Taiwanese food you can get in Madison. And the bubble tea, the interior, and the friendly staff all add to an overall authentic and pleasant Taiwan experience. Highly recommend!

I have been here about four times. I tried the chicken cutlet, braised pork rice, all 3 bento boxes, pig in a blanket, and various tea products. The food was pretty much exactly what you would get from a street stand in Tainan, the historic southern city of Taiwan. I would say the highlights were the braised pork rice and the chicken cutlet. The braised pork was well-marinated with a balanced blend of spice and soy sauce, giving it its irresistible aroma. The amount of fat was just right so that when combined the pork and rice felt smooth without being too greasy. I was genuinely surprised when I saw the chicken cutlet - it was huge! Easily palm-sized, if not more. With its size, it still managed to have proper coating with plenty of crispiness, and a juicy inside that was well-marinated. 10/10.

As other reviews already mentioned, tea products were awesome. They make a good combo with the tapioca(bubbles) since the tapioca served are less sweet than what you usually get from elsewhere, and so your tastebuds can really savor the tea without being saturated by sugar.

Aside from the food, one can see that a lot of thoughts have been put into the design and decoration of the place. It radiates with that personality and human warmth of a hidden cafe that a traveler would happily stumble upon when exploring the many nameless streets of Taipei. Worth mentioning is that they also play a good mixture of music ranging from renowned singers such as Cheer Chen to up-and-coming indie bands such as \"No Party For Cao Dong\". I enjoyed their selection.

Overall great place. Will go back.

PS: some reviews mentioned the lack of certain kinds of food and long waiting. From what I heard they are tweaking their menu and trying to figure out a way to meet the large demands. Hopefully these problems will be resolved soon. For now I suggest going there a bit early to avoid the line and get everything you want."}
{"text":"My mom is from Taiwan and was very excited to eat here. It was very authentic and the food was delicious! I ordered the chicken cutlet bento box which was the perfect size. The flavor in the chicken and side vegetables were great. Loved the place and atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Love the fried chicken (???)! 
The milk tea is not too sweet and has a strong tea flavor
Best Asian food that I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic. This is truly the Taiwanese street food i miss from childhood. Crispy, savory, salty and fresh. Its so good! Now if they add some brick toast desserts to the menu it will be perfect."}
{"text":"Great quality and amount for the price. We got the braised pork and the chicken cutlet. Both were seasoned very well! Just be aware that the chicken cutlet does not come with rice unless you are getting the rice bowl. Bubble tea was also great!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place! I love the ambience. It's very well lit and has some really nice decor inside. The setup is ideal for a comfortable catch-up with friends. 

Food wise, most of the options are fried ones. But those fried options do taste quite good! The chicken cutlet and the fried squid balls had a nice crisp while keeping some of the juiciness of the meat/squid. The coffin toast is a nice option for a cold day (think chicken pot pie). 

I was a little disappointed in my drink, the mango jasmine tea. We asked for a less sweetened drink and it was still much too sweet for my taste. Next time I may just try to get it unsweetened."}
{"text":"After relocating to Madison, I've been missing the foods in Taiwan so much. Earlier this week, some friends from Houston visited me, they noticed this newly-opened restaurant and asked me to give a try. We had chicken cutlet bento sets, which were way beyond my expectation! Though it's a bit pricey but definitely worths it! We also ordered tea leaf eggs and jasmine tea for takeout, which are the best fits for midnight snacks! The location and ambience is absolutely a plus. Will come back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"This is NOT the place to go if you're vegetarian. There's only 2 veg items on the menu (cold noodles and tofu rice bowl), so I ordered the cold noodles. The menu says the noodles come with tofu and egg along with veggies and peanut sauce. I got only veggies and peanut sauce-- I went back and enquired about the tofu and egg. They seemed confused, like they didn't know their own menu, and gave me 1 single piece of tofu. It was a bit insulting, like I was asking for something that wasn't on the menu when that was clearly not the case. The noodles were average, but seriously, they need to know what's printed on their menu. Please don't give me a tiny piece of tofu as a consolation prize for reading the details in your menu."}
{"text":"I know I should be thankful that there's a place here in Madison serves Taiwanese food. But as a Taiwanese, I just can't help to be picky about the food here. I've visited here several times, have tried over 7 kinds of food on the menu. The Tainan braised pork over rice was pretty tasty, but the braised pork could have cooked longer. Drinks overall is not bad. Popcorn chicken , tea flavored egg, tempura fish cakes and fried squid balls were mediocre. Pig in a rice blanket was pretty good on the first time I visited, but for $6.25 for half of the regular size, it was about my pinkie finger size. Seriously? I paid $6.25 at least give me a whole one. Second time, due to the flavor was good, I had Pig in the rice blanket again, the flavor went off, especially the rice sausage, the outside coat of the rice sausage was so weird, never had this kind of rice sausage before, couldn't even finish the rice sausage. For the Fried chicken cutlet, it looked delicious, but the texture of the chicken is weird, really chewy, like chewing plastic, the flavor was too salty. I would go back for the drinks but for the food, not quite sure about it, because to me, the quality does not seem to fit the price here at Taiwan Little Eats. I truly suggest Taiwan Little Eats to improve their quality on food or adjust their price."}
{"text":"I have had food and drinks from Tapioca Express, Q-Cup, Fantasia, Gong Cha, and Sharetea... Taiwan Little Eats is terrible. Hands down, the worst I've ever had. I am a huge foodie and I don't mind paying for good food but Taiwan Little Eats is extremely overpriced (more than California and we all know how much rent and everything cost over there!) and the food taste like s@#$.  It's odd that their popcorn chicken advertised on their website is \"mouthwatering.\" I know it's made of chicken breast, and that's ok! It's just EXTREMELY dry and not mouthwatering. The drinks are alright... If I am desperate for milk tea, I'll make some at home from now on. Next time you're craving for some popcorn chicken, you might as well stop by Mcdonalds for their chicken nuggets."}
{"text":"Stopped in to check this place out for the first time. I loved the atmosphere. It's very cozy and open with lots of seating options. The staff were also very friendly. 
I ordered the squid balls, milk tea, and coffin toast. They were pretty good, some not my cup of tea. 
The milk tea was my favorite. The tea is very strong and fresh made and I had lychee jellies added. It was the perfect drink for a single digit day. 
The squid balls were tasty. A little over salted but still very interesting. The coffin toast has an impressive presentation. It really is like chicken pot pie in a fried toast shell. 

I'm personally not a fan of fried food and there aren't many options that are not, which is the main thing keeping this from being a 5 star review. Regardless, I think this is a great addition to state street."}
{"text":"Super wow. Another casual, unassuming foodie gem hits the Madison scene. I'm not Taiwanese so can't comment on the authenticity (though many prior posters have), but the food was tasty, the vegetables fresh, everything flavorful and well seasoned. Dishes were not too heavy, either. The staff were friendly and helpful, patiently explaining everything to our party, who were completely unfamiliar with Taiwanese food. Will definitely return frequently to this State Street winner."}
{"text":"Got the fried chicken cutlet and loved it. The spice combination was really intriguing and they kept it toasty in an insulating blanket. Yet to try the bubble tea but will be back to do so!"}
{"text":"TLDR: It could be better. The building blocks for awesome flavor are definitely there, but it doesn't seem like they're getting put together properly, and right now the food is just kinda bland. 

I ordered the tofu rice bowl. The tofu is fried with a lovely skin on it and topped with a very nice sauce. However, beyond those, the tofu had very little flavor, and it was very moist. I would have liked to see it lightly marinated or some moisture pressed out of it. Plus there wasn't nearly enough of that awesome sauce.

The bowl was topped with steamed broccoli and carrots (neither seasoned), a very well made ramen egg (this is NOT a vegan dish unless you explicitly request it), and some very tasty pickles (I think it was a root vegetable of some sort, but I didn't ask). The rice was boring old white rice.

There were a bunch of amazing elements to this dish that I absolutely loved, but they were muted by the very bland tofu, rice, and steamed vegetables, which made for a fairly bland dish altogether. I do not recommend the tofu rice bowl, at least until it is improved."}
{"text":"The milk bubble tea here is delicious. We ordered the Jasmine Milk Tea and Taiwanese Milk Tea to go and were really happy with both drinks. (We think that the Jasmine is the more fragrant of the two though!) Their teas are lightly sweetened and unlike other bubble tea shops, the tapioca/bubbles aren't noticeably sweet. Great choice for those who don't like their drinks with half a pound of sugar!

Side note: if you order their drinks for dine-in, they come in adorable mason jars!"}
{"text":"This was just an average experience for me.  The place is nicely decorated.  We got the popcorn chicken, but the flavor wasn't what we are used to.  It didn't feel like popcorn chicken.  The tea drink was okay too, nothing to rave about.  It is in a nice little area in Madison."}
{"text":"Is it possible to get quantity and quality? If we're talking about the fried chicken at Taiwan Little Eats, then my answer is definitely yes!! Just look at the size of this thing! Before we got our order (which was out fairly quickly), I told my friend about the fried chicken at a night market I attended in Taiwan that boasted \"chicken larger than your face\". Well, I was pleased to discover that this chicken measured up. The seasoning was good and very authentic, but I did find it to be a little dry and would have loved the option of a wet seasoning or a dipping sauce on the side. I also ordered the Tainan Braised Pork. The flavor was delicious, but it was also a little dry and maybe over cooked. The pork cutlet, however was very juicy and lightly coated in a mild, sweet and tangy sauce. I would have loved to have the option of this coating on my fried chicken. As for the tea eggs I tried, what can I say? I love me a good Taiwanese convenience store staple. You can't go wrong here, and these eggs were done very right! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Reminds me of home!  Great people and great service!  Though not a comprehensive representation of the food heaven that is Taiwan, it's the closest Madison has ever gotten in the 15 years I have been here!  The food is authentic and simple, worth every dollar! Go try it!"}
{"text":"Good taste and reasonable price. The size is appropriate. Bubble milk tea is what I like, not too sweet."}
{"text":"Loved the food and cute decor of this little place! The milk tea is delicious as well! We got our food in less than a few minutes of ordering! Will definitely eat here again! Nomnomnom!"}
{"text":"I came here with my friends at noon on Sunday. 
We discussed a lot about what to order while waiting for a long queue.
I was going to order a \"Night Market Style Chicken\" and \"Fried chive cake\", but they told me that they didn't serve these today.
Unlucky! Then I ordered a 24 oz Taiwanese milk tea for 4.5 dollars and fried chicken wrap for 6 dollars.
By the way, there were so many people and the restaurant was so small that we had to stand while wait for our food to come. Well, this is common when the restaurant is very popular and their food is very delicious and I'm glad to accept it.

BUT, the milk tea was lack of flavor for me and I only got around 6-7 little wraps for 6 dollar ( I don't know if that's worth for you but I would rather go 7-11 and buy a box of fried wings instead of spending 20 minutes on walking to get this fast food restaurant)

Well, Chicken wraps tasted good :)

2/10 will not try again"}
{"text":"With college bars and national restaurant chains lining the block, State Street is generally not the place to be if you're looking for high-quality food. 

I was skeptical when Taiwan Little Eats moved-in in early 2017, but they have quickly become a shining beacon of Madison's vibrant food scene. 

Atmosphere is cozy and personal. We had the salted and crispy popcorn chicken (which we ordered seconds of) and bubble tea. The owners couldn't be more friendly and eager to tell us about their restaurant."}
{"text":"I am glad that there is another asian restaurant on State St to add to the diversity in Madison food culture. The decor is pretty hip. You are greeted with the menu board on the top of the counter. Then order and pay at the counter and wait for the food. You can sit any where you want but I feel like seating is a bit limited. There are two tables by the window which are elevated and kind of weird to sit there being higher than others and being looked at by people walking down the street. 

We ordered the fried chicken cutlet bento box and Tainan braised pork over rice. Although the place is famous for its chicken, the braised pork appealed to me better. It was well marinated and cooked to the perfect level of softness. The chicken of course couldn't beat the deep flavor of the marinated pork but it was decent as well. The outside was very crisp and the inside was not too dry. The meal as a whole as well balanced with carb, veggie and protein. I do think that it can be a healthy lunch once a while. 

I also tried the matcha milk tea and it did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"We tried the tempura fish cake, popcorn chicken, braised pork rice and chicken cutlet bento. Overall, the taste is pretty good but everything is on a pricier side. The menu is pretty small, it feels like they're running a food cart business just because of how little options they have. On top of the limited options, they did not have half the things when I was there. I'm also a little disappointed that it is missing oyster omelette and oyster noodle!!! Seating is a little tight, wished they had kept the seating from previous business. The braised pork is quite a huge letdown, it's supposed to be a hearty meal, I want big chunks of fatty pork, not minced up fragments. The chicken cutlet bento was incomplete, it was supposed to come with some pork(?), looking at the pictures now, some kind of sausage? Whatever it was, it was missing the time I tried it. It still has a lot to improve, and I might check back again, or not."}
{"text":"What a cute little spot on State Street! Love the cute decor and seating area with tables and couches for people to lounge. 

The Tainan braised pork was so yummy and pretty authentic. Tender and nice pickled veggies over a some warm rice - yum!

Crispy Chicken Cutlet bento box was also great although I prefer the steamed fresh broccoli to be warm (steam to order) than cold. The breading on the cutlet was really good and still pretty light being fried. 

Definitely worth making a visit!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has REAL Taiwanese food. I used to live in Taipei for work years ago and I missed the food a lot. The menu is small but well done and has very reasonable prices. The staff are very friendly too."}
{"text":"If you want to feel like being in Tainan, Taiwan, this is the place! 

My go to dishes are
1. Fried Pork Rib over Rice ????
2. Vegetarian Tofu over Rice ???
3. Fried Chicken Cutlet over Rice ????

Friend had Coffin Toast ??? and said it was good as well! P.S. From their Instagram page:  Starting Monday (7/2/18), we'll have an Afternoon Tea Set including one 16oz Iced drink and Taiwanese style thick toast for only $6!! Come in between 2-5 to try~~~

Don't forget their section of milk tea, brewed tea, and fruit teas!"}
{"text":"I'm glad this place exists. It brings a niche culture to state street. Chinese food is not the same as Taiwanese food. And it's so cool that now we have a place we can go to to experience that. I was born in Taiwan but came over to the USA when I was young so do not know of the fabulous night markets that my mom talks about. 

The decor here is very cute and makes it a cozy place. 

Moving on to what I have eaten here...

Fried Squid Balls- These are salty and have a hint of ocean taste. I like them these little balls of friend goodness. 

Tea Flavored Egg- This tasted just like a regular egg to me, not sure if it was because it wasn't steeped long enough but I enjoyed the soy sauce eggs that come with the bento boxes more. 

BBQ Pork Sausages- These definitely don't taste like American sausages, they are bit sweet. I like them but I can see the flavor throwing off some others. 

Crispy and Salty Popcorn- Delicious snack, can't really go wrong with this. 

Fried Chicken Cutlet- This is a HUGE piece of chicken. Delicious but I wish they maybe cut it up into pieces for you. 

Tainan Braised Pork over Rice- I wish there was a little more pork in the serving but I do really enjoy the flavor of the pork. 

The bento boxes come with broccoli that I wish they would season with some salt or pepper! It is literally just steamed broccoli. 

The teas here are nice because you can adjust the sugar and ice levels. The drinks aren't overly sugary. I love the coconut jelly option, their tapioca balls are also great. Can't wait to come back to try their faerie jellies.

From the times I've stopped in business seems good! While there may be better Taiwanese food out there this is the only place in Madison and pretty decent for being the only option so I am giving them 4 stars. I hope they do well and maybe even expand their menu options in the future once they get settled."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all the Asian joints that have popped up since I've been in Madison 3+ years ago. Taiwan Little Eats is an adorable cafe to grab a quick bite, some boba, and hang out with some buddies. There's wifi, natural light, and soft Chinese music in the background, which makes for a good place to get some work or self-reflection done.
I had the tainan bowl, which consists of pork belly, tea egg, and some veggies over a bowl of rice. The pork belly was flavorful and very tender. Even though it's Taiwanese fusion, the flavors are still authentic (yay!)
If you're getting the milk tea, I'd recommend 50%. I got 30% and it boardered on the not sweet enough side for me."}
{"text":"Charming little place on State Street with friendly staff and unique menu! It is a nice quick-stop if you're looking for a snack in between classes or want a new space to just drink a warm tea and read a book. I love the interior and window seats - very cute. I haven't sampled many of their food options, but I love their tea! I like that it's never overly sweet. My only wish was that they would do some lactose-free milk teas. They all sound great, but I can't try any of them!"}
{"text":"Bubble tea is good, very creamy and tastes like what you can get from Taiwan. The fried chicken is also good,well seasoned.A little disappointed about the fried fish cake tho, doesn't feel authentic."}
{"text":"Great Food! Great customer service. The chicken is sooo crispy! Definitely will back again."}
{"text":"Being Taiwanese, I'm torn since I'm super happy that they opened up a place like this in Madison, but it really isn't THAT good.

To be fair, I don't expect amazing authentic Taiwanese food here, so that's why this place still certainly gets a 4 star review. 

Their milk tea is above average - definitely better than Kung fu tea. Their tapioca isn't that great (from the few times I've tried it), but perhaps they'll improve over time! New restaurant tend to take a bit of time to hit their stride.

The food is prepared pretty fast, and there's a decent amount. The bento boxes are great, but a LITTLE pricey I would say. I expect stuff like this to be more in the $7-$8 range, and the bento boxes are $9.50 without tax. The food is certainly good quality though, but not AMAZING...

Anyways, overall a great place to stop by! Taiwanese street food is AMAZING and im glad this place is bringing some of it to Madison."}
{"text":"Food was Good. I ordered the fried chicken cutlet bento. It came in a bowl. Sliced Fried chicken deliciously seasoned. It came with seasoned rice, tofu, picked radish? And broccoli and a half egg. I wasnt a fan of the pickled Radish. It tasted artificial to me. But everything else was worth the 9.50. I also tried the Tea Boiled egg $1. It was good. No need for salt. 
When coming here be wary, its more of a college student joint. Not alot of space for big group. Space is limited especially lunch hours. They're food and teas are delicious though. Definitely worth a try. 

A tip: their little eats are not a meal. Just so you know. The G2. Grilled chicken cutlet is literally just the chicken cutlet in a bag. So if you want a meal order the Bentos."}
{"text":"I was super excited to see this place pop up on State, and got to check it out while visiting Madison recently. Taiwan Little Eats is absolutely adorable inside - very cozy, trendy, and somewhere I would love to come back to catch up with friends and relax. They have chill music that took me back to growing up listening to Asian pop, which was a nice surprise. The menu is nice and limited to give you a good taste of Taiwan, although flavor-wise, was only decent.

Taiwanese Braised Pork: 4/5. Pork is really tender and tasty, and definitely the star of this dish. Our rice was kind of cold, which was disappointing, and the vegetables and tofu needed more flavor. The soy stewed egg was okay - also needed a bit more flavor and creaminess. Overall, this dish could be stunning with a few modifications!

Fried Chicken Cutlet: 3/5. Yum! The sauce on top of the fried chicken is DELICIOUS and so savory, I only wish there was more of it on there. The chicken was nice and crisp. But again, the entire dish was way too cold and that really took a lot away from the overall dish.

Jasmine Milk Tea: 5/5!!!!!!!! Incredible, and best boba I have tried in Madison. Very aromatic with amazing flavors. Tapioca was made perfectly and the temperature was perfect. 

Pouchong Milk Tea: 4/5. Really interesting roasted flavors and also a really nice tea. 

Service was a little weird - the cashier kept trying to speak to my friend and I in Chinese, although I was the only one who could understand and tried to order in English. We were also served in to go containers, although we were dining in.

Overall, food all has good potential and could be incredible with a few modifications. The bubble tea and ambiance are really the main attractions for me to come back to this place though. I think they are an excellent addition to State Street and I wish them all the best!"}
{"text":"Exotic, fun, and delicious sharables.   This is our new State Street go-to for out-of-town guests.  We keep ordering the same things, trying new things, and there's still things on the menu we want to try!  Our favorites, in my terms, include, chicken in a bag, a spicy curry chicken, perfect for 1 or more, fish balls, with an addictive salt rub, and gravy in a box (what is that even?!).  I wasn't a fan of the milk tea with jelly, but that's personal preference, because, hey, they offer both bobba and jelly.  

There's an outdoor seating area, and inside has a lot of character. It's a great place to sit, chat, and like I said, share an interesting bite with friends."}
{"text":"2/5 stars, a blatant waste of money. Where do I start. Let's get the good things out of the way first. The decoration is appealing and the service is ok. If only the same could be said about the food.  The portions were very small for the amount paid. Almost 6bucks for a fistful of tempura fish cakes that weren't evenly seasoned. Some pieces were much saltier than the others (at one point it felt like I ate a spoonful of salt).10 bucks for a fried chicken bento that comes with rice, UNseasoned broccoli, half a cutlet of chicken, HALF an egg and HALF a meatball. I get that meat could be expensive but half a meatball?! Half an egg?! I also ordered Tainan braised pork rice and my oh my. The pork was less than a fistful and was very dry (tasted like it was microwaved) and there was no gravy or sauce to add moisture to the meal. It was overall unsatisfying. I was really excited for this place to open at first because I really like Taiwanese style street snacks. But after giving this place a try twice, I would say that I am utterly disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here three times so far and was only able to eat there once. The food was good, but I couldn't get the items I really wanted because they were out of almost everything. Second time they were closed early because they were out of food. This last time, they were only serving tea when I arrived. Apparently they only have certain hours where they serve food. The most frustrating part of this is that no one from the restaurant let us know they were out of food/not serving food until we waited in line for awhile. I hope this place actually has food at some point..."}
{"text":"The Food Scene in Madison has had a reputation for being rich and diverse, full of local and personable establishments -- however, despite all these things Madison has been missing a number of things, 'ethnic-holes' if you will.
Taiwanese street food is something I've only ever heard of but never had the opportunity to try. After spending time in Mainland China, culinary culture involving Taiwan or Hong Kong became increasingly foreign -- At least until Taiwan Little Eats came to Madison.
I don't think I've ever been this excited about food in a long time. From the ?? to the ?? -- Taiwan Little Eats is something very special.
My only hopes is that they extend their business hours and sell Taiwanese loose leaf tea separately on the side.
10 out of 10, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I've been lamenting all the new chain restaurants on State Street. This adorable, cosy, family-owned restaurant is anything but. The food is light but filling, if such a thing is possible. Super nice employees. It's the kind of place you think people should know about. Yum!"}
{"text":"I think I'm between a three and a four on this one. I wanted to like it a lot, but I don't think I do. I ordered popcorn chicken because that's a Taiwanese Little Eat special... (as in, what they actually have in Taiwan). It wasn't anything I would crave in the future. I don't really miss it now.

I ordered a bubble tea. It was also okay. I prefer bubble teas at other locations downtown.

The tables are handmade, I assume. It's a nice touch, but some can be uneven. It's interesting, for sure."}
{"text":"We're glad we tried it but don't plan to go back. 

Since I have visited Taiwan a few times, I was excited to try the new restaurant. The first time we went by they had run out of food. Really??? Strange, but ok they had only opened the week before. Going in today I saw them cross out some items in the menu after we had ordered. Weird. 

I ordered the fried chicken bento box. The dish came in a bowl with lots of rice, a piece of tofu, some cold broccoli, and carrots. The chicken was moist and had some flavor. The rice was noticeably oily. I can't say the dish was too appealing with no flavor popping out. Having tried the popcorn chicken my partner ordered, which is also fried, It too did not have a lot of flavor. 

For the $9.50 per bento box you pay, it seems like a lot of money for a smallish bowl."}
{"text":"Terrible service - almost all the staff had an attitude and kept getting orders wrong. Two of the employees, a tall blonde guy and a girl with short ombré hair (who relunctantly told me her name is
Ophelia after demanding I tell her why I'm asking), were openly mocking customers among each other behind the counter. My mother and I overheard and Ophelia stared us down and offered no apology. Uncalled for and unprofessional to bully customers, especially for an up and coming business. We always tip the highest amount possible and support local businesses, particularly new ones. However, we won't be coming back after this disappointing experience. Hopefully, the owners will take action to prevent this from happening again to future customers and provide customer service training to their employees."}
{"text":"Taiwanese food is one of my all time favorite cuisines, so I was thrilled to learn that this restaurant opened two blocks away from me! Friends and I came in to try their minced pork rice, fried chicken cutlet, popcorn chicken, Taiwanese sausage, and roasted oolong milk tea with boba.

Their minced pork rice was on point, but could definitely do with more pork.

As for the chicken cutlet, I was hoping it would taste similar to Hot Star Chicken in Taipei, but it's got a slightly different flavor. I'm wondering if it's because we decided to try the BBQ flavor instead of the Taiwanese spice one. Besides the flavor discrepancy, the actual chicken was very juicy and delicious!

I really enjoyed the popcorn chicken and its spice and crunch! Only wish it had some fried crispy basil too!

The milk tea wasn't my favorite, but I'd be willing to try other flavors or maybe mess around with the sugar ratios in the future.

Overall, I am happy to support this establishment which serves some pretty authentic Taiwanese eats! I cannot wait to come here more in the future and try out their other meals."}
{"text":"Love both Chicken bento box and pork chop bento. The fried chicken is a little dry. The pork chop is more juicy. By the way, the pork chop is fried pork chop instead of small pieces of pork ribs. A little different to my thought. 

The bubble tea is just normal level from my understanding, or maybe I have too high expectation. And you need to pay extra money for the hot and no ice choice!!!!"}

{"text":"This place was great! I have the fried Squid balls and the braised pork over rice. I probably waited 3-5 minutes for my food. Loved my food. I want to go back to try everything else!"}
{"text":"Small little place with some nice Taiwanese food and drinks. Prices are affordable without breaking the bank. It could get busy as the place is small. The food is delicious!"}
