{"text":"There's no menu online I called and requested that one be sent to me, they said they would do it within the hour. But the next day the manager informed me it was literally impossible. Got to the dinner, my husband wanted a breakfast sandwich with pastrami, but they have informed us that custom orders are not permitted. The cashier confirmed if I wanted the French toast three times (which the manager informed me that they do not have any sweet breakfast items except for pastries). FYI the pressed French toast, was \"pressed\" a few days ago. The bread was hard and burnt. My husband's corned beef sandwich looks like it came out of vending machine. Fries and lox plate were good- nothing special."}
{"text":"Relaxed setting Diner atmosphere very casual a great place to relax"}
{"text":"It's a shame that the service is so terrible, the food was pretty good. Incredibly understaffed and the staff that is there makes no effort to let incoming and current customers know they are even aware they are there. Saw over half a dozen people walk in and right back out after not even being acknowledged at the register."}
{"text":"The burgers are good and priced reasonably for a casino. The onion rings seemed like they are made in house. They were tasty. That's all I've had from here. I've been twice late at night. 

You order at the counter, get your own drink and they bring the food to you. You can use your slot points or get a paper comp from the pit or a host if you play at Plaza. The staff is friendly. It is a nice quick stop for a meal at Plaza that is an upgrade from the food court."}
{"text":"Unassuming place, empty every time we went to it. Had the bbq bacon burger, the anytime burger, the mushroom swiss burger and the avocado toast. Everything was very very good.  Definitely try this place out if you are in the area. They were accommodating with changes we asked for and the staff was pleasant. We did not have breakfast."}
{"text":"Um, they brought me the wrong thing from what I ordered. The stupidest thing however was  they won't give you a water cup!!!!   You have to buy water from a bottle.  I felt very \"nickle and dimed\"!!

Oh yeah, also $3.50 for coffee in such a casual cafe?!?!?"}
{"text":"Saw the posts on Instagram about this place opening up, & loved the vintage feel to it. Very clean, & the staff was super friendly. The cashier was new but she was very sweet & cute. She explained you could only use the Royal Rewards players card once, so of course my friend used it for her order ha! I had the Plaza burger, minus the lettuce & tomato- I'm very unhealthy, ok? I believe that was $8. I added bacon- I go two skinny slices. And the side of fries. They were seasoned, but not worth $8 for the teeny tiny paper cup they came in! The food was good, but definitely not worth the prices. However the service was lovely. The black gentleman that was the waiter (you order at the counter & he brings the food over, you seat yourself) was so friendly & funny & attentive. He gave us our plastic tips for our Pepsi's & straws, & brought over napkins & plastic fork & knives. Our food was served very quickly, within 10 mins. 

Besides their rather outrageous prices, it was $15 & change for everything, not that bad for a casino to be honest, I loved this place & will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"SLOW!  No other way to put it, I will never come back to this joint.  I came here when it is half empty and 2 women are beyond slow."}
{"text":"I purchased a Cobb Salad 12/29/17 at 11am. It cost me $16+ and whoever manages this place should be ashamed to sell food! The grape tomatoes were so overripe that it had a garbage smell. The bacon, eggs and canned black olives had NO FLAVOR, at all. The chicken was old and hard, but you could taste that it was, in fact, chicken."}
{"text":"This place is off the beaten path Ina humdrum nice service was not there but the food was great you had to collect it menu of things and options that were just out of the ordinary love the way they did the chicken sandwich in the morning with the eggs over easy dripping down with the gravy all sometimes leave this was an old Vegas over by the Golden Nugget it's a hike but it's worth it if you're in that area"}
{"text":"$16 for a pastrami sandwich?  Way too much and not that good.  Go to the deli near the Horseshoe sportsbook. It's cheaper and better."}
{"text":"Great spot! I had the chorizo, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and it was very fresh and tasty. Everyone very nice and courteous. Definitely will return"}
{"text":"All I can say is that, it is a wonder this gem at the Plaza isn't busier.  The staff were awesome!  They were attentive, extremely friendly, helpful, welcoming, and the breakfast sandwiches were perfect portions of taste!  

If you are staying at the Plaza, then this is a must place for a good morning breakfast sandwich and coffee.  Again, the customer service and food both were awesome!

We had the Chorizo, Egg, and Cheese breakfast sandwich.  This is flavorful, deliciously cooked, and hits the spot!

The Plaza Hotel and Casino staff could take pointers from the staff at this wonderful gem!"}
{"text":"I tried restaurant again and had great service and food. I understand sometimes a restaurant runs out of item. I ordered the pastrami sandwich and onion rings and it was great."}
{"text":"While getting a couple of drinks in downtown, I overheard a couple of their employees talk about their salmon being 2 weeks old and smelling like death, happened a couple of times apparently. They also chit chatted about how the cheese gets hard, isn't properly taken care of and how they have gotten customer complaints, all while laughing. I would be cautious when eating here. Maybe just stay away from the salmon and cheese?? Lol"}
{"text":"Absolutely love love love this place. Food was delicious and affordable, staff was friendly and helpful. We ordered the best BBQ brisket that I've ever had....ever!!! Terry, our server, was the best. Food came out fast, fresh and hot. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"We stopped for a quick bite in morning. I had breakfast sandwich. It was good. My husband had a burger. He said it was ok. This place is good for a quick pit stop."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great service. Menu maybe small but don't pass this cute place up. Food is hot fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"The food is okay but it always takes 10+ minutes for food. Not talking burgers or anything like that, for a PB&J sandwich. Each time I go back I hope for better service but get let down- Has happened now three times .."}
{"text":"Save your money and time, go somewhere else.
Mc Donald style service, when you can get it.
Overpriced, overrated"}
{"text":"The fantastic onion rings were almost enough to rate this place four stars, but the burger I ordered was very average. 
I don't think they have combos, but wish they did.  My burger, onion rings, and soda came to $16, and that's about 4-5 dollars too much. 
Rather limited menu, but I kind of like that.  I almost ordered cheesecake, but they didn't have any toppings (cherry, strawberry, etc.)"}
{"text":"What a gem! So glad we stopped! The service is fantastic and hands down the best Avacado Toast I've ever had! Fresh guacamole, marinated tomatoes, fresh herbs and creamy cheese! Loved it! And the fresh squeezed orange juice was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Eating here is probably the worst decision you could make downtown, for a variety of reasons.

My wife and I went on a weekday near lunch and it was not too busy.  We quickly placed our order and sat down.  We ordered a sandwich, the American Breakfast, and some chili.  Oddly, the American Breakfast was served almost immediately, while the sandwich took another 3-4 minutes to come out, and finally the chili another 3-4 minutes after that.  What restaurant brings out food for one person and makes the other sit there for several more minutes for their food?  This is not something a restaurant should do.

In any case, the amount of food you got is very small in comparison to what you pay.  The $11 American Breakfast comes with what was either one extra large egg or two small eggs.  The bacon was very small, super thin, and almost entirely fat -- you'd get better/more bacon on a McDonald's breakfast sandwich.  On top of all this, they put it on a tiny plate and unceremoniously put your toast (which is unbuttered, and no butter is served!) on top of it.  Want to put jam on your toast and still have it on your plate?  Nope!  See my picture for more details.  $11 for this is a complete rip off.  The sandwiches are a tad cheaper at $7-$8, but they come without tater tots and if you added them on ($3 for an order of 14 normal-sized tots) it is again overpriced.

The chili came with sour cream, for some reason, so neither of us would eat it.  Pretty much everything else on the menu actually lists what comes with each item, but not the chili for some reason.  The cashier never asked us if we wanted onions, cheese, or sour cream in our chili, but at least I'll accept that the former two items are standard additions.  As of this writing a Google search for \"chili\" shows 230m results, while \"chili -\"sour cream\"\" gives 229m results.  Yes, let's list the exact ingredients in a bacon, egg & cheese sandwich (bacon, scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese), but not list the major components of the chili, one of which happens to be relatively rare.  Seems like a good idea!

Although we haven't had all the menu items, a cursory look at other prices on the menu indicates they tend to be way too high.  $3.50 for a soda, $3 for a bag of chips that can be bought from a nearby casino gift shop (meaning they're already overpriced) for less than half the price?  From looking at the other reviews, I'm at least the 4th person out of 14 reviews that say the food is overpriced, and in some cases, outrageously priced.  

Now that Las Vegas Club is closed, Golden Gate lost Dupars, and Mermaid's is gone, Plaza has more of a captive audience than ever before when it comes to hungry patrons, but this place fills absolutely no niche.  Everything on the menu can be had cheaper & better at Hash House a go go, the coffee shop, Zaba's, Subway, or McDonald's -- all of which are less than a 60 second walk away and inside Plaza as well!  Even if you do want a standard sitdown breakfast and didn't want to go to Hash House, you could walk over to Binions, Four Queens, The D, or Downtown Grand and get better food, more food, and cheaper food than here.

I like all of the food options at Plaza aside from Brightside.  Given the type of food they serve and the poor service, poor quality, and poor value, I can't see this place lasting long unless major changes are made to the menu and prices."}
{"text":"Love it as soon we walked in. Cute, small quick breakfast or brunch place, a 50's soda stop. Steps away from the main lobby entrance. Fits the vintage classic feel of the Plaza. And you gotta take advantage of the jukebox."}
{"text":"Just left the Brightside in the Plaza Casino and I had the ham, egg & cheese breakfast sandwich with a cherry danish, followed-up with a cup of Gero Nero coffee and it was ALL GOOD...the atmosphere is nice with music playing, highlights and news flashing on the screens and friendly staff....very good experience.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This spot was a pleasant surprise.  It's quite big and very clean.  We felt the service was quite good, in fact, on our way out, we made sure to compliment them.  The food was very good.  Order the onion rings!  I don't know what they do to them, but they are seriously the best onion rings I've ever had.  I felt the prices were fair being that it's a casino restaurant.  We will be returning!"}
{"text":"This is getting 1 star because 0 is not an option. 9$ for a meager excuse for a burger? 16$ for an anemic sandwich? The garnish looked like it was picked out of the trash. The competition is too fierce in the neighborhood, you have to at least try."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a quick bite and got the allover burger. It was $8 plus tax, does not come with a side that is extra. For Vegas spending money is to be expected, so I though the $8 was a deal. The hamburger was fantastic. Buttered, soft, brioche bun. The burger was a decent size and cooked to perfection, plenty of juice and flavor. Even the bacon was crispy but not over done and the cheese was an ooey cheese sling which is fantastic and how all cheese on hamburgers should be! The service was also fast and friendly for being a quick order joint. I was superbly surprised and happy with my yummy burger!"}
{"text":"I say this place was pretty good. Really good mushroom burger and a really good spam and egg sandwich. The Oreo shake was amazing. The french fries were good and crisp. The place was very clean and the people were very nice. Most importantly the price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Brightside is what it is. Its nothing wow but not bad at all . their burgers are actually very delicious and for the price you do honestly get your bang for your buck! Pastrami is too plain and soft would be better served toasted and with some sauce. Its literally just me at on dry bread that's it ! The tomatoes are way too thick for the burgers by the way. The turkey sandwich was amazing but again too much turkey over powers the taste. The staff is nice and friendly and I do hope this place picks up !"}
{"text":"I have officially eaten here 4 times and am a fan. Are there better burgers elsewhere? Sure. Might they be cheaper? Maybe. We need to remember that this place is located in a casino where many of us folks are comped and the prices, I think, reflect this. I really have to rave about a couple of their items. The first is the bacon, egg and cheese. Delicious. Something like I make at home. I loved the old school crinkle cut fries and the onion rings did indeed taste homemade. I also want to give a small shout out to the downtown chili. Very meaty and satisfying. My one criticism is that it could use some Oomph. Or at least offer packets of hot sauce or sriracha. I have found for the most part the staff to be efficient and friendly. I have heard many times about slow service and while I do believe it happens - I personally have not experienced it. I think it is a fairly solid choice when at the Plaza, particularly if Fast Food doesn't sound great. Good shakes when they are done thick!"}
{"text":"Not good. Paid almost $40 for 2 burgers (no fries), one piece of avocado toast, one fountain drink and one bottle of water. Place was practically empty when we got there and it took a solid 30 minutes to get our order. The other couple in the restaurant was waiting for a manger to refund their money because they weren't willing to keep waiting.
It's Vegas. I wouldn't mind the price gouging or the long wait if the food had been great. It was really bland. I don't think they even seasoned the meat with salt and pepper.  I only took a few bites and decided to save my appetite for dinner. 
Staff was nice enough."}
{"text":"I had the anytime burger and it was amazing. You can't go wrong with an egg on a burger. 

Brightside has tons of televisions and projectors which makes it unique for a breakfast or lunch spot, they play a lot of the UFC fights and sporting events so it's a great alternative to places like Buffalo Wild Wings to watch an event, plus its downtown so after the game or fight, you can hang out around downtown and take in all the fun around Fremont street. 

I'd recommend Brightside cafe for a quick bite to eat or a fun place to watch a sporting event."}
{"text":"The worst food I've ever had! Burgers are horrible, no flavor, stale buns, plain, ketchup mayo & mustard packets on the side, no seasoning, lettuce was wilted, tomato was tasteless, bun was massive & no flavor. The only thing I tasted was the char from the flat top that the burger was cooked on. Absolutely discusting. Threw away one burger after only one bite & returned the other after only one bite. The pickle served with the burger was the only thing good & that wasn't anything special. Overpriced & not worth a penny. Horrible disgusting tasteless food!!! I was starving & would have eaten anything but not this I'd rather starve."}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing to call home about. Service can be improved greatly. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Rude waitress bad food. We went for fathers day brunch and the blonde older woman was extremely rude took half of our parties order then the second half. Our food was a waste."}
{"text":"My first time here. I had the avocado toast and onion rings!  Both were delicious! The toast had lots of avocado and was seasoned well.  The onion rings were huge!  Will come back soon!"}
{"text":"I had the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich on a Hawaiian roll.  I though the sandwich was great.   The wait time was short for the sandwich.  The restaurant is clean, bright (no pun inteneded) and open.  I was apprehensive at first after seeing some 1 start reviews, but I am glad I decided to risk it.  It is a great breakfast place to hit on a budget.  I plan on going back next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and would return. Decent food, fair price, friendly staff. But it takes forever to get your food. Be patient. Good place."}
{"text":"This restaurant should be called Not so Bright Side. They  starts off with two stars because while you spend $15 and you still have to go to register to put your order in despite going to bar/counter. What leaves this review at 2 stars is that you do not get a courtesy glass of water. They want you to spend $1 on a bottle of water. If you ordering To-Go then this may not be an issue to you but for those who are dining in it is to me. Prices are reasonable that's another reason why they get 2 stars for this review. My issue is this is the worst casual dining experience I ever had. Whoever own this restaurant is evidently proven they have zero experience in hospitality business nor educated in one as well."}
{"text":"My best friend, my husband and I went to Brightside for dinner as it was located in the lobby of our hotel, the Plaza downtown Las Vegas. 

First of all, menu items are grossly overpriced here. Be forewarned that a bag of Lay's potato chips, snack size, will run you $3. The sandwiches are roughly 10 with no sides and their Mile High pastrami is a whopping $16.

When we first arrived one of the servers told us it would be a minute before they could take our order at the register. We stood around for nearly 10 before someone finally meandered over and asked us if we were ready. Of course we were ready, we have been waiting for you for quite some time!

The older blonde lady with glasses who was working the register did not seem happy to be at work at all. Over all the employees seemed annoyed with having customers.

We ordered two breakfast sandwiches and two Philly cheesesteaks. The breakfast sandwiches were pretty good, served on yummy brioche bread. The Philly Cheesesteaks on the other hand were a disaster. It was just shredded steak topped with a very plasticky nacho cheese.

As we had received the items just prior to their closing, we didn't get a chance to taste the sandwiches until we got back up to our room. They were so disgusting we didn't eat them at all, but rather went to bed hungry.

The next morning I went in to ask about getting our money back and was told that we were not able to do so because it was not the same shift. The same blonde lady was working and called her manager to see what could be done about our complaint. She seemed pretty annoyed at having to deal with our situation at all. No one was even the slightest bit apologetic that we didn't enjoy our food. The server even told me that she really liked the food and couldn't understand how I wasn't a fan of the cheese. 

We were given a note which allowed us to get two more sandwiches at a later time during our visit. So back we went and got a club and two Italians. Both of the Italian sandwiches were a little bit on the dry side, the club was pretty good. 

The service on our second visit was downright rude. My guess is that it had something to do with the fact that they were really annoyed with us having returned two of their inedible sandwiches.

I hope you see this review before you decide to eat there, because if I had checked out the reviews on here I would have been forewarned. Do not waste your money on this barely edible, overpriced food."}
{"text":"We ate at this restaurant this morning. I had gotten the smothered southern fried chicken. My dad had gotten the same dish and my mom had gotten a burger and cheese fries. The food was delicious and we will definitely be dining here again. Fried chicken dish we got was way larger than I thought it was going to be and the price was definitely worth it. The white gravy was delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the crust on the outside was seasoned amazingly. I recommend it. The scrambled eggs and bacon on the top was great too."}
