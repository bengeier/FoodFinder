{"text":"Went here a while ago to eat Chinese dinners (not all you can eat hot pot) and on some nights, they were unwilling to cook it for us although they had the ingredients for them.  I suspect it has to do with their laziness. And then on other occasions we had hot pot but the waiters never brought us our said amount every single time, even though it wasn't a ridiculous number. The best thing is their coconut ice cream and that's it."}
{"text":"it really wasnt anything speical.  Service was really bad compare to other hot pot places nearby"}
{"text":"How would you define All-you-can-eat (ayce)?    Well I would expect myself to pay a certain amount...let's just say, $26 for instance, and everything on the menu would be available to us. Right?  Not at 100 Degrees Hot Pot.  My sister, husband and myself walked into this place at around 9:30pm.  It was late, and my sister and I wanted to try an ayce Hot Pot buffet.  And boy, was it a mistake.    The ayce price did not include seafood, but for an additional $5 (I believe) you can \"upgrade\" to the seafood menu.  So we did that.  Little did we know, our \"upgrade\" consist of a few piece of salmon, 6 shrimp, 6 mussels, 3 squid, and 3 clams.  And if we split it between 3 people, it would be 1 piece of salmon, 2 shrimp, 2 mussels, 1 squid, and 1 clam.  How is that ayce?  When we ask the waitress, she just said, \"oh that's all you get\".  What the hell??  So we started ordering more beef and noddles since we were not going to get filled up on seafood.  After waiting an hour for our food, I flagged down a waitress, and asked for our food.    Her words were: \"the kitchen staff is eating dinner.  You will have to wait.\"  WTF.  After hearing her words, this waiter stopped off at our table, and told the waitress, basically to shut up, and he will get us our food.  We were not impressed at all.  I would give this place 0 stars, but I can't.  The meat isn't extremely fresh, the seafood was still frozen, and the service was slow.  I would not go here again."}
{"text":"We were very impressed the first time we came here. And even though we sort of know part of the family that owns the place, we had to give it a 2 star review.   The initial spread to create your own sauce was still very impressive and the service, once the food started coming, was very good. Drinks refilled instantly, boiling water for the cooker all without asking.    The big problem is the food. The rib eye was old, the beef fillets were tough, the tendons were greenish and nothing else really stood out.   Also, the mens room was very...pungent. The decor and good service was not enough to mask the sub par food."}
{"text":"Not as good as seen in some reviews...soup base is plain (tasteless) and sauce is very basic. Nothing special or unique there...if I'm not mistaken, there is a Kobe beef. Do not order that because it is obviously not Kobe beef. There is no such a full dish of Kobe beef at a cheap price...however, it is better than Kim Tao hotpot in term of cleanliness and friendliness..."}
{"text":"Place is clean.. food is normal.. lots of variety..  Very flexible which i like... overall i would say it is good"}
{"text":"I had called and the guy on the phone said they weren't busy.  5 min later I'm in there and they asked us \"how many?\".  3.   NO.  WE BUSY.  20 MIN WAIT. Empty tables and they won't seat us because there's only 3 of us.  They'd rather wait for big groups to reserve a table or to walk in.  they do their busy according to how many people walk in and not on \"Customer service\".  I have my own business and I make customer service #1.  And so I've got incredibly  loyal customers and 100 Degrees just lost 100 customers if not more.  I will never go back to them, never go with family or friends, never refer them!  Ignorant and dirty way to do business!   So Disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"The go-to place that my friends and I go for hot pot. They stay open really late which is a huge bonus when you feel like stuffing your face on one of those cold Canadian winter nights. My friends and I have been going here for years (5+).  The service here is spectacular. Usually, at AYCE places, service can be a drag and places can be understaffed, but 100 degrees has always had spectacular service. Everything including servers coming around to refill your chrysanthemum tea to taking your 5th order - the servers are friendly, polite, and easy to understand (i.e. they speak English well).  The food here is solid.  The quality is above average compared to most hot pot places. But let's be honest here, the goal when you go to AYCE is to stuff your face with decent quality food. If you want high quality sit-down stuff, go to North 44, Auberge, or something. Not sure what all the people on here complaining about quality are talking about (priorities for AYCE should be 1) location 2) quality of food compared to other AYCE 3) price). There is a good selection of choices for sauces from soya sauce and egg to satay to peanut sauce to hot sauce and chopped onions. The meats (slices and balls) are fresh. The veggies are good as well. The pork blood is alright and the pork liver is usually quite juicy (if you like that sort of thing). Of course, they also have the standard stuff that you would find at hot pot places such as udon, normal noodles, tong ho (a type of veggie),  And to finish it all off, they have really good coconut ice cream for desert.  The late night price of $13.99 is simply ridiculous for AYCE. As I said before, the ones complaining about the quality of food (you're going to AYCE... what do you expect), wait times (that just means that they're busy and that other people like coming here... it's your fault for not reserving a table), not being anything special (well duh, it's AYCE) are nitpicking at minutia. For the price ($13.99!!!!), location (conveniently at Highway 7 and Woodbine, near World Bowl, many Asian houses (lol), and lots of BBT places), and quality of food, 100 Degrees is pretty much as good as it gets."}
{"text":"went there yesterday with family.  decided to try it out as we'd never been to a hotpot place before and reviews seemed good.  5 of us in total - came out a tad on the pricey side i thought.  appearance: stylish and functional.  well kept and clean.  gave me confidence in trying something new.  food: was good but the sauces to use for customized dipping was a tad bland.  broths were good and so was food.  saw menus on the table that looked like set menus (but no English translation) -  would be nice to know what or if they were set menu as that may be something we could've selected.  didn't like that waiter came around to add hot water to the hotpot if they saw that it was getting a tad low.  it diluted the taste of the broth - so would suggest that they add more of what you order if they will do that or at least ask if you want to have it topped up with hot water.  would've liked the waiter to have explained more that our selections were from \"extra\" cost section as it was overwhelming trying to select the 1st time around.  there were new food items listed on the table but the list for ordering didn't include the items - waiter didn't say how we could order those.  overall an ok place as it was something new to try.  not sure that i'd say it was bliss or extraordinary"}
{"text":"This hot pot restaurant is located near the Sheraton Parkway / Host Restaurant. We happened to pass by this restaurant, and saw the hot pot sign. So, we decided to try it.  We all liked the food. They give you a choice of \"pick your own menu\" or \"all you can eat\". We picked the AYCE option. there were a lot of options to choose from: Beef Ribeye, Beef Brisket, Pork, Meat ball, fish ball, tofu, vermicelli, spinach, napa cabbage, etc... that's just to name a few... they have tons of options. make sure you don't over ordered. we ordered a bit much, and got so full by the end of the meal. it's easy enough to order extra if you're still hungry  the soup came in different options also: clear / spicy / satay / pork bone etc...  we got the pot with two broths options - spicy and pork bone.    we also got the seafood platter option. it came with shrimp, oyster, scallops, salmon, geoducks, etc..  One negative that I can think of is wine. They only let you order wine by the bottle. They didn't let you order wine by the glass. :(   The other negative is that they only accept visa and mastercard. No american express is allowed.   I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times.  As far as hot pot places go, this place is ok.  I won't explain the concept of hot pot because it's been done several times here already.  The food seemed fresh, and the service was ok.  To me, neither was much different than a lot of other hot pot places.  And like the other hot pot places, the broth used for the cooking is filled with sodium and MSG.  So don't drink too much of it if you have an issue with either substance.  What did differentiate this place for me was the decor.  It is newer and nicer than all the other hot pot joints, and it looks quite clean (though I can't speak on the washrooms because I follow the golden rule that one ventures into a washroom at a Chinese restaurant at one's own peril).  Basically, if you're willing to brave the long lines (reservations don't count for much here), then this is a good option for pigging out.  ADDENDUM:  It's been mentioned here that for some seemingly illogical reason, the vegetarian option is more expensive than the one for omnivores.  I was confused by this too, until the owner explained to me that the vegetarian option includes more expensive vegetables that you don't get with the omnivore version.  For the higher price to be worth your while, however, you would have to go for the pricier stuff when you re-order.  If you're going to stick with lettuce and spinach, you might as well go for the omnivore version and skip the meat."}
{"text":"Just recently took the plunge to try something new and might have found a new late night restaurant with my buddies. At first I was kind of skeptic about the quality of food and just the general idea of this style of eating. After going about 3 times I seem to be hooked! I enjoy the rice noodles, lamb, beef balls, and making my own custom hot sauce. I usually stick to satay broth because I feel it gives a nice tasty flavor without overpowering the broth. I usually come here any time after korean BBQ down the street closes if anything, but recently I have to say I would prefer hot pot over korean bbq now because of this place. Definitely recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"We found a set of cockroach legs in one of the dishes. There was visibly a hair inside the dried garlic container. Most of the ingredients that we ordered for the hot pot came pre-cooked, which is very unusual for a hot pot restaurant. Are we meant to just reheat the ingredients? Isn't the whole purpose to cook it? There are easily 50+ better hotpot restaurant choices in a 5 mile radius."}
{"text":"As a hot pot place , the most important part should be the soup base. However their soup base is too light, need to add a lot of sauce in order to taste my food. The variety of food is not bad though. The drinks they provide kinda taste like chemical. If there are choices I won't come back. But it's good for a big group of ppl."}
{"text":"Came here after recommendation from a friend. Price is relatively competitive with other places. Selection is not as much as some other hot pot restaurants but that also helps with selecting your food faster. Service was extremely good and fast. The quality of food is average. Will come back for the convenience and good service."}
{"text":"Are you cold and can't seem to get warmed up. Then head over to 100 Degree for some good'ol asian soup Fondue.. haha  So much I can say about hotpotting. What can be better then getting a group of friends together on a cold winter day and stuffing your faces.  A Variety of soup bases to choose from, Traditional to Thai Spicy. I'm very impressed with the Seafood platter option here, fresh and clean (which most place aren't)  The ingrediant here are fresh and cleaned properly. Don't ask me how, I just know haha. Seriously though, coming from asian parents, making sure the food is clean and fresh IS a serious thing!  Other than your normal rare meats, dumlings, beef balls, etc...   They have a variety of specialty items. Instant noodles, spam & hotdogs.. COME ON now, how great is this. Hotpot instant noodles is the greatest thing. If you haven't tried you must. Cook it in the Thai Spicy soup base with some lobster and watercrest.  I've been to ALOT of hotpots and been kicked out of a few, but this one to date, brings the cleaniness, freshness and great customer service.  Keep up the great work boys & girls  Any hotpot lovers welcome to join our next mission, because hotpot is war!! haha  Herman"}
{"text":"When my boyfriend and I are feeling for hot pot or if it's late at night and everything else is closed, we come here!  It really isn't anything that special. No special items or drinks or desserts out of the norm, but they have what I like and that's good enough for me.   I also like their sauce selection. My boyfriend loves their sesame (that's what my friend told me it is but the waiter said it's peanut so...idk) sauce. He would be happy if that was the only sauce available. We order the clear soup and satay. Then for dessert, he'll have the coconut (prescooped) ice cream and I have the mango pudding.  Our go - to hot pot place."}
{"text":"The first time I went, it was really good. It was open late, and things came out promptly. They have a wide selection of items as well as an additional side order menu of other items that are usually included in hot pot.  Recently (i.e. the last few times I've gone;), it's gone downhill. They removed the chrysanthemum tea (which my boyfriend and I love). We thought it separated the 100 degrees from other hot pot places. Also, I feel like their quantities of items come out wrong. I would order 2 pieces of something and I felt like it wasn't enough so I'd get 4 pieces but it still comes out as 2 pieces. The rice in a pot (\"bo chai fan\") takes longer and longer to come out every time I go. The last two times I've gone, I had to ask them about the status of it. They would check in the back and say \"it'll take another 5-10 minutes\" or \"the order isn't in the kitchen\". I remember ordering the rice with my very first order and it wouldn't come out until we've finished eating.   Finally, once we sat in the back table, the side where the door is but the very far back table. And the water just wasn't boiling. It took forever to get a few bubbles to \"break\" the surface but once we put ONE piece of food in there, it stopped boiling. We told the waiter and he said, it's like that. We complained again after a few more minutes of this ridiculousness, and he brought a lid and claimed \"it'll help it boil faster\". Not the point. Both times we've asked to move to another table but he just claimed nothing was wrong. Finally, after the lid trick didn't work, we demanded to be moved and everything was normal with the one we moved to (btw, we kept the same pot, so it was definitely the stove).  The funny thing is, another couple came in, and they sat them down at the same table we just got moved from and we could just tell they were experiencing issues too. By the way this is all based on my experience about two months ago.  Overall, I would have given it 4 stars before. But since gone downhill, they get 2 stars.  EDIT: Now given Kevin N's response. I would like to add a few things. I returned last night to give them another chance. They did have chysanthemum tea so yay for that. However, to dispute Kevin's response in terms of portion control, while they may reduce the order some items, they also gave me MORE than I ordered. For example, last night, I ordered 2 dumplings and 2 pieces of fake crab meat. I received 4 for each when the order sheet asked how many pieces I wanted.  Also, service was still not so great. My hot pot was running so low on water that I had to flag down some to refill while I saw them check on other customers and their water was refilled. In fact, when they went to refill the pot of a customer sitting directly behind us multiple times, they never checked on our water.  So, I admit that my first review was a little outdated, this one isn't. The portions are not what I ordered. So I change my review from 2 stars to 3 stars (based on the tea) but I'm unhappy with Kevin's response since I review based on my experiences over the course of many months and I do feel like it's gone downhill. I am unhappy with the service and the quality of their stove tops, which all goes into the quality the establishment and customer experience (even though he believes its uncalled for)."}
{"text":"Yumm!! I had a great experience at this hot pot restaurant.   Granted, I'm still learning when it comes to great hot pot, but I do know good food. This was very good food.   I went with a group of friends - some experienced and some new to hot pot - late at night during the week. One thing that I really like is that they're open until 5 am - outrageous! We arrived around 11 pm and there weren't many people but the food was fresh (no browning meat - gross), tender and the staff was attentive. When you go after 10 pm they have a \"midnight special\" - it was around $12/per person for AYCE.   Their sauce spread was impressive, although some of the items (fresh hot peppers) did look like they'd been sitting for the day. We got the satay and some other broth (can't remember :S) and enjoyed the squid, drunken chicken, dumplings, hand sliced beef and quite a few others. We stayed for 2 hours enjoying the tasty spread, as the broth only got better with time - with a movie on in the background (granted, I couldn't understand the language) it was a nice way to unwind after a long day.   We finished the meal with coconut ice cream and mango pudding - yum.   Our group didn't experience any rude waiters, but then again we did have some Chinese people so we didn't have a language barrier to deal with. The restaurant was clean, service was fast and the food was tasty - I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I took a group of my friends here for Hot Pot.  They were all North Americans and it was their first experience at a hot pot restaurant.  The waiter was very patient with our group and explained the entire process of cooking, and mixing of the various sauces.  We all enjoyed the evening as this was a new experience for all of them except me.  We were fortunate to deal with our waiter.  The other waiters in the resturant spoke limited English and came across very rude.  We enjoyed the food menu, and their great food variety.  It was however over priced for hot pot.  We each paid about 30$ with tax and tip included, which is quite pricy in comparison to other hot pot restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"The food is average, service is alright and the sauce is great however the type or variety of food available is pretty limited.  The place is also kinda dirty as the floor is very slippery."}
{"text":"Hot pot, hot pot!  What becomes so special here is the table of seasonings that you can choose to blend and mix for you hot pot.  It is your own choice to have a bowl of saurce that fit your taste.  The beef slice is not the top grade but is very good already.  It is fresh and tender.  We did not order the seafood as the whole table is not keen on it.  There are a lot of vege that you can consume at the end.  The drunken wings is good for meat other than beef.  For pork as it has to cook longer and is not the favour of the day.    Unlike any other hot pot restaurant, there is cheese cake from Cheese Cake Factory. Of course, it is not included in the price of the hot pot.  Be prepare that eating hot pot is always full than a normal dinner!"}
{"text":"3 stars because it's open late and the soup bases were pretty good. Most of the ingredients we asked for were ok (the veggies, sliced beef and dumplings) but the beef balls were not good at all. I can't even explain the taste, other than it was just horrible - maybe it went bad or something, I'm not sure.  If you need a late night place to eat, that's all you can eat (for $13.99), then this place will suffice."}
{"text":"I'm sad that this Hotpot All-You-Can-Eat has gone downhill since the last time I came by. I had wanted to write them a four star review but they are nowhere close to that any longer.   First off, they do NOT honor their Yelp checkin offer, so don't bother showing your server who will take your phone to the owner who claims to know nothing about it.   Second, they used to serve chrysanthemum tea or plum juice which is the norm when dining at a Hotpot restaurant, but we only get water now!   There are tables reserved for people playing Mah Jong in their back rooms, so even when we reserved a table the gamblers in the back were still given first priority - our group of ten ended up sitting at two separate tables because the big round table was also \"reserved\".   There's not much to say about the quality since it is an AYCE restaurant, don't expect quality meat. I was also disappointed that they took a few of my favorite items off the menu - chewy glass noodles for one..   I need suggestions on decent Hotpot restaurants in the GTA because I LOVE Hotpot and don't want to resort to coming back here.."}
{"text":"Hot pot. It hits the spot. You can eat a lot. Wear stretchy pants.  It was my first visit to 100 Degrees.  I was pleasantly surprised. :)  Things I liked:  * It's a nice place! Brightly lit and clean! I was surprised that the restaurant was well-ventilated and spacious. The staff was friendly and attentive, more than your average Asian eatery.   They came around to top off our cold Chrysanthemum  teas and remove used dishes. This place is open 5pm to 5AM, in case you need to stuff your face right before bedtime.   * A large variety of dipping sauces! I like mixing the soya sauce, green onions, garlic, and hot oil. Or peanut sauce and hot oil. Or just dousing my stuff in dark red Shacha sauce or Hoisin sauce   * Good selection of meat (and other things) I feel like all-you-can-eat Asian places are great if you are carnivorous, but you may not be getting the best bang for your buck if you are vegetarian. $15 bucks for a lot of meat is good. $15 bucks for broth, noodles and lettuce is bad.  I found most of the items tasty, I particularly liked: - Sliced rib-eye beef and pork - Home-made wonton dumplings - Noodles galore! Konnyaku (yam) noodles in cute little bunches, udon, spinach noodles, and more. - Deep fried tofu! Strangely chewy but delicious.  * Broth They had a variety of broths, 5 were free. I'm a big fan of satay broth, we had the chicken broth as well which is pretty standard.   It was a fun time and I enjoyed my meal, even though I dislike having to cook my own food! :)"}
{"text":"I should really list 100 Degrees as one of my hobbies...does hot pot count as a hobby? Like, maybe a freezing cold Canadian winter hobby? Or maybe it's a sport, given it provides the challenge of all-you-can-eat at 100 Degrees.  Mmm hmm, yes, challenge accepted.   I always get the spicy ma-la broth, which looks much spicier than it is.  There are a lot of peppercorns at the bottom of the pot though, so just be careful when scooping out your piping hot goodies that you don't accidentally get a mouthful of peppercorns.   I've yet to order the add-on extras of Kobe beef or seafood, as I've found the regular fatty beef to be deliciously marbled enough on its own. My favourite item is the gluten - fried puffs (...of I don't know what they're made of, magic?) absorb the flavourful broth.  Just make sure you soak them for a long enough time until they're fully soft and soggy, then squeeze out the excess liquid with your chopsticks before eating them.   Oh great, now I've given myself a hot pot craving again. Mmm, hot pot."}
{"text":"I don't know why the reviews for this place is so bad. I went the other day expecting it to be bad, however I was pleasantly surprised.  Meat was fresh, everything came fast, nice environment.  Only complaint was they didn't have a lot of sauce. There was a lot of people at dinner time too. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Service is non existent. We waited over 40 minutes for WATER (no joke, we asked at least 6 times to different servers). I'd rather they just make the place self-service. I tried going up to grab a water pitcher for the table myself but didn't see any.  The satay broth was a frothy greasy pot of oil... That ain't right, I've had satay broth at other places before.  AYCE doesn't include any seafood except squid and fishballs. The food was alright, but what's the point if there is 0 service.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"My husband works at Hwy7 and Leslie, so I drove there and met him for lunch at 100 degrees. This was my first \"hot pot\" experience and I really liked it, though it would be better on cold winter day. Presentation of ingredients was excellent, especially sliced Kobe beef plate. Typical Chinese service though, no smiles, everything very business like."}
{"text":"Immediately when I heard of the name 100 Degrees, I thought of my first Cash Money CD from back in the day.  Obviously this place has nothing to do with Juvenile, Birdman or Manny Fresh, but imma review it anyway!    Hot pot outta bed, turn my swag on, took a look at the kobe beef and said what's up.  Yes that's right the manager complimented my GF and I with a plate of fresh Kobe beef for out Hot Pot meal.  It was delicious and tasted as if it was carved from a sacred cow from Narnia.  Indeed it was tasty along with the other plethora of food we ordered for our AYCE experience.  Service was top notch and these guys cleaned up my plates faster than I could eat.  The portions were perfect and they didn't slop on mile high amounts of food we didn't want.  At the end, we were treated to dessert and probably the best coconut ice cream I've ever had.  I asked for seconds, thirds, fourths and the waiters had no problems bringing me out enough to fill my craving.  Will I come back here?  Oh fo sho!  Instead of lining up for an hour in the cold at Little Sheep hot pot, while people literally rub shoulders with you while you eat.  I'll come here instead.  It's one of the rare chill and relaxing hot pot joints uptown and dat sauce station is at yo table!"}
{"text":"Came here a month or so ago for late night. It's your typical all you can eat hot pot place. When I saw all the 1-2 stars on yelp, I was skeptical. After trying it out, I'm not sure how it's worse than any other hot pot in the area.  Decent food, decent sauce tray on the table for you to concoct your own mix, decent service. I think it's more or less on par with Hipot.  7/10 for the food, 7/10 for service, 7/10 for value. 7/10 overall (not an average)."}
{"text":"Came for a late-night dinner with family on a weekday night. The bill wasn't bad at all for AYCE - $13.99 per person for late-night hotpot, before taxes and a 10% service charge.   Offered Iced Chrysanthemum Tea (which was nice seeing as how one review here said they didn't do so). Broth selection was limited to 3 choices (clear, cilantro, or satay) unless you want to pay an extra $5 for better choices. Menu selection was pretty normal and nothing special, no seafood choices (though they offer oysters and lobsters on the side, which was interesting). However they include eggs and a selection of condiments/sauces to mix, and something ingenious is they include two chopsticks at every seat - one for handling the raw food and one for eating.   Servers were polite and service was fairly quick, which was surprising since late-night servers are usually a little slower or less friendly (especially at Chinese restaurants). Clean atmosphere with others enjoying late-night AYCE hotpot. Also licensed for liquor as well, a plus for groups going out for late-night gatherings.  Overall: Great place for normal (emphasis on 'normal') AYCE hotpot whether going alone or with a group, especially with the late-night $13.99 special. Only reason why this doesn't get a 5-star is the somewhat dull decor. Though granted for late-night AYCE hotpot, you probably won't notice that anyways when you're busy stuffing your face with beef. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Despite all the terrible reviews, I still wanted to try this place out. My brother goes here all the time with his buddies and is kind of a food snob, so I figured we'd be safe.  They have a few really great items, and a few meh items.  The seafood thing really is a rip off. $5 extra per person for a plate of (1 per person) mussels, scallops, surf clam, salmon, white fish, oysters and a few shrimp. The surf clam was tough as rubber, and nothing really blew us away. The scallops were good, and I enjoyed the oysters, but that's about it.  The hot and spicy soup was indeed hot and spicy, and the cilantro and preserved egg soup was nice and flavourful. I particularly enjoyed the beef brisket, spare ribs, lamb, and beef. Everything else was just fine, but not remarkable. Take a pass on the beef balls. They also had frozen soup dumplings, which are normally steamed. I've never boiled them before, and they really aren't the same when cooked this way.   Service was very good, the food came quickly and empty plates were whisked away in seconds. The servers were very friendly and every single one wore a smile. The soup kept going down in temperature every time we put something in it, which was a bit of a drag. I'm sure they would have moved us to another table had we asked, but that was just too much effort for me.  We ate until we were bursting, and then some.   It was pretty good, but doesn't really hold a candle to the nearby Kim Tao Hot Pot in terms of selection of quality."}
{"text":"Not sure where all these negative reviews are coming from. Maybe because I'm not a Markham local?  Came here around midnight with friends after catching a late flight in. It was actually our second choice since the Korean BBQ place was closed (thank goodness this place is open super late)  Got the special and opted for one half of a normal soup and one half of a better soup ($5 to upgrade). Loved the tray of sauce components they give you - 100% customizable and kinda cute. No complaints with the veggies and meats but I guess I didn't love the dumplings.   Got this chicken and rice dish in a ceramic bowl. My friend said it was kind of a specialty and it was good to try!  Service was okay. It was pretty busy and it looked understaffed for the amount of customers there. Took a while to get water refills, eventually they just gave us a pitcher.  This wouldn't be my first choice to eat in Markham, but I would go here again for late night :)"}
{"text":"I have passed by Highway 7 many times and have never noticed 100 Degrees Hot Pot... As one friend lamented \"Who the heck goes for hot pot in the summer?\"  I do!  My only other hot pot experience was at nearby Dows Noodles.  I must say that 100 Degrees was anything but hot.  We arrived on a Sunday night around 7PM to a relatively empty restaurant.  It got slightly busier as the night wore on, but I would say the restaurant was operating at half its capacity.    We opted for the Seafood option (don't be fooled, the seafood is not AYCE, you get one platter which consists of squid, salmon, shrimp, oysters, mussels, cuttlefish and 2 types of their house fish balls).  For an added cost of $5, it was not bad, but nothing impressive either.  We ordered the clear broth as well as the satay for our soup bases.  For those of you who have never experienced hot pot, I think the best way to describe it is Chinese fondue... You basically have a heating element in the middle of the table, you wait for the soup bases to get to a boil, and you cook a variety of raw meats, dumplings, vegetables etc in the broth.  The flavour comes mainly from the condiments provided (soy sauce, peanut sauce, hoisin sauce, satay sauce, chili oil, chili sauce, scallions etc).    Every table has a stand-alone side table next to it to hold the condiments tray, as well as serve as a buffer for space when you have reached the \"OMG we ordered way too much!\" juncture of the meal.  I opted for a cup of Chrysanthemum Tea (cold, included), and they were good with refilling my cup throughout the evening.  Their menu had your standard hot pot selection (beef, lamb, pork, dumplings, beef balls, fish balls, vermicelli, udon etc) with things such as chinese glutinous rice with preserved meats, nian gao (rice cake),   which are not so common but are food items with more substance to give you that feeling of satiety.  Their dessert offerings were scant with only mango pudding and a SOLE flavour of ice cream (coconut) available.  They definitely don't get 100% from me because of a few things:  Although they were only operating at 50% capacity, they seemed to be rotating their condiments trays around as ours disappeared mid-meal and we had to ask for it back when we ordered our second round.  They didn't thaw some of their items properly which led to us biting into unpleasant bits of raw/uncooked items... There is nothing less attractive than having to hurl something back out from your mouth at the dinner table.  The soup bases were nothing spectacular.  For $27.50 at the end of the day (including automatic 10% service charge and taxes), I wasn't satisfied with my overall dining experience.  The food was not very flavourful, and as I previously mentioned, not properly thawed.  I think hot pot is only something that I will opt for on a cold winter night.  And if I do, I will opt for Dows Noodles.  The only thing that they are superior for is their level of service.  Dows is super busy, and they forget to bring you things, and/or are hard to flag down."}
{"text":"Hey sooo.. Went to this restaurant  around 6:30pm no one was in the restaurant, me and my bf were the only person eating, the soup base was ok? But could of been better the only thing good about this place was there options for making your own hot sauce. I recommend  never eating the CHICKEN and BEEF as it was rubber taste. The lamb had only FAT around the meat, had to throw it out caz there was no meat in the Lamb just FAT. The service is not what I expected , I was ignored and had to ask for my drink 2 times... Maybe hotpot isn't a good heart warming food. My advice don't go, useless you want to eat FAT from the meat!!!! Never again sorry :("}
{"text":"Came here with 9 ppl. We ordered large amounts but was given small portions every time. Ex: 20 beef balls ordered 7 given each time per order not even enough for 1 per person at our table. Its AYCE but the small portions they give really ruins the AYCE experience especially with large groups of ppl. Its just really annoying to constantly call for service to order the same types of food. Not recommended if you're really looking forward to the hotpot experience with a big group of friends who love to eat."}
{"text":"I've been to my fair share of different hotpot places especially along the highway 7 and Leslie area and this one is by far the best one! They make the tom yum soup in house and it is full of flavour. Totally worth the extra $5. There is also a lot of variety for you to make your sauce. A lot of fresh ingredients (e.g. Fresh garlic) is available upon request.  This hotpot location also offers chrysanthemum tea, which is so refreshing and makes my meal so much more enjoyable.   They have recently started a new menu for those who aren't hungry enough for AYCE. You choose your soup base and 8 items (extra items at a small additional cost) for a personal hotpot.   The staff here are great and they're efficient, especially for an Asian restaurant.   For dessert, they have mango pudding and coconut ice cream (as well as different flavours of course) that are really good! There are small chunks of coconut pieces in the ice cream and the mango pudding is served with evaporated milk. The complete icing to a perfect meal!"}
{"text":"Went on New Years Eve, the service was terrible.  Food was good but the catch is you have to enjoy the random chance a spider or cockroach shows up on your plate.  Yes, there was a spider on our plate, and a cockroach chilling with us on the wall behind us.  http://img822.imageshack.us/img822/3222/20121231221729.jpg http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/7756/20121231230011.jpg  The waiters/waitresses did not want to be there.  It took forever to order, get our order, had to ask for sheets to order items because they did not give it to us, had to put my hand up and stare down waiters to get refills, and they seemed to have nothing in stock (we asked for cocktails, they said they couldn't, then we ordered ice cream and they ran out)."}
{"text":"Definitely would never come back to this establishment. After we were seated (which was very prompt) - we looked down under the table and we were horrified at the level of dusts / dirt / food remnants (Especially near the wall). That was an instant turn off if the sticky floor wasn't a turn off enough.  The main concern of this establishment aside from the cleanliness would be the food. Aside from the very limited selection, the quality of the meat is just plain abysmal. It was served to us half frozen in a very unappetizing look (definitely does not look fresh). Taste of the protein (beef / lamb) was just as expected - tasted like frozen meat and dry.   On the other hand though, service is pretty good. Our server was attentive in either asking for if we need to order anything / asking if we need anything.  I just realized that 10% was added to our bill already and I gave them 10% additional on that, I guess my bad I didn't see it more carefully."}
{"text":"My first 2 star review.  Located off Highway 7   Went in sat down & selected the Seafood option which to my Utmost Disdain was NOT ayce & consisted of squid, salmon, shrimp, oysters, mussels, cuttlefish & 2 types of fish balls.  On the boiler was clear broth & satay in a segregated pot. The heating element in the middle of the table, wait for the bases to boil, then throw in various flesh of your choosing.  Flavor is derived from chosen condiments such as soy sauce, peanut sauce, hoisin sauce, satay sauce, chili oil, chili sauce & scallions.   Menu had beef, lamb, pork, dumplings, beef balls, fish balls, vermicelli & udon to name a few & there was also  glutinous rice with preserved meats, which was quite tasty.  Rotating of the condiment tray amongst other tables was a turnoff for me as I should not have to ask for my condiment tray back when I am mid eating.  Items were not properly thawed. I do not believe it is attractive when I have to hurl an unevenly cooked frozen-cored dumpling onto the table.    $27.50 at the end of the meal (including automatic 10% service charge and taxes)  Service was OK but the food was unspectacular.  I was NOT satisfied with my overall eating experience.  I may return but only for their late night specials on weekdays."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place a hundred times (hah note the pun) but have never really thought about coming here.  Since the weather is getting a-chillier, I decided it's probably a great time to give the place a shot.  As you can tell from the name of the place (well kinda) his place is all about hot pot.  For everyone that doesn't know what it is, it's essentially fondue, but instead of cheese or oil, it's a broth of some sort (you get to choose).  As far as I know there are 3 other places you can go for hot pot in the area, so this is me continuing my adventures around to tour them all.    Upon entering, you'll notice one of two things... 1. It's cold... perfect cause with a packed house it's gonna get real hot with all the steam (but kinda sucks if you're there alone... bring a sweater just in case).  2. It's a pretty big place that you can sit comfortably.  The place is actually decorated with pretty trendy lines and décor which is kinda nice I guess.  Now on to the food.  The broths they offer is actually quite extensive.  You have your basic egg and pork broth, satay, but it gets a little bit more interesting with the pork bone soups and the other kinds of new soups they offer.  They also have a \"make your own sauce\" platter which lets you create your own sauce from a variety of ingredients (garlic, chilies, satay, soy sauce etc).  In my opinion, it really turns out basically the same with a little variation here and there (ie. Mine is hotter).  The thing that kinda bugged me about one of the ingredients was that the garlic was roasted till it was like crumbled peanuts.  Note, this doesn't really diffuse well in sauce, they should have it as dice garlic for maximum potency.  In terms of the options of food that they have, honestly, they don't really have that many.  They do have a lot, but when you compare it to other places, they're missing some variety (ie. Dows noodles offers way more different \"good\" things).  The dumplings that they offered were really not that good, and the surf clams that they had were dirty and not clean.  I think the key thing to a hot pot restaurant is really good ingredients and a large variety of them.  (ie. Not just beef, and lamb.)  A cool thing about this place is that they offer \"marinated beef\".  Essentially it's the beef that they use in Chinese noodle dishes.  In my opinion it was kinda funny cause it's all tenderized and stuff.  Not really what I was expecting, but at least it was cut really thick.  They also offer \"Kobe beef\".  This is far from that, basically it's fatty beef from the store.  You can actually get it from the meet store on valleymede and hwy 7 two blocks away from there.  Kinda funny how they call it \"kobe beef\"... they should really come up with a certification for kobe or waayu beef.  I guess 2 stars seems kinda harsh for a rating, but the description says it all... \"Meh, I've experienced better\"."}
{"text":"We have 9 people here and we had 3 round and some dumpling and other food left on the table that are not finished yet. But our beef is done so we wanted to order more beef and lamb only. The waitress told us we couldn't order the beef because we haven't finished the food on the table. Wtf??? Do we have to finish everything first to eat different food? Maybe we want to eat beef now then the dumpling. What kind of all you can eat is this??? The owner is just cheap!!! You should never try to control the food quantity when you have a AYCE restaurant. If we all leave and left lot of food then it is wrong. This is our last time here. This place has changed since the last time here."}
{"text":"This AYCE hot pot restaurant has a more healthy way in making its food. However, this did not work for me as it was too healthy. I like my hot pot with MSG. Aside from this, the food is always fresh and tasty. The service is welcoming and nice. The restaurant decor is nice but could have done a little more. Although my low score, I would recommend this people who eat healthy and do not eat MSG food"}
{"text":"Don't ever come here. There's cockroache after I was done eating. It was crawling right in front of me on the the table. Horrible!"}
{"text":"Came here and expected a bad time due to all the mixed reviews but this place is actually pretty awesome!!  The service was great! I love the all the sauce options and the best is that they serve unlimited chrysanthemum tea!!!    great price, food came fast, I recommend this especially in the winter!"}
{"text":"** Note : 100 Degrees Hot Pot is now CLOSED since Aug 30th **  The food here is excellent.  I have been here several times.

{"text":"O.M.F.G!  Seriously people - I have re-found my hot pot bliss.  Friday: It was cold. I was hungry. And I knew I was all-powerful in bending my family to every pregnancy whim.  It was time to cash in my hot pot ticket!  \"Hot Pot\" can mean a variety of things, but as far as I understand in it's original form it consists of a pot of broth, a ton of food and saucy mixes, and a few hours sitting around this pot cooking your own foods and making a hot mess.  Sounds horrible?  I find it to be pure bliss.  Seriously.  It's delicious, spicy, healthy and great fun.  I have always been a Shabu Shabu fan - with the main difference being more options and better dipping sauce in \"Hot Pot\".  We came to 100 Degrees Hot Pot after reading the very helpful review (and photos) from Sanfit T.  The place was packed and we were the only honkeys in the place - an excellent sign.  The decor was simple but surprisingly nice (I shouldn't be surprised, everything is nice and new in the north China town) and we waited for about 20 minutes to be seated.  Let me say, we were dotted on by young, perfect English speaking servers.  Normally when I've hit up a random place in \"north China town\" I rarely get a glance, let alone all the fabulous service we got here.  Everyone answered our questions happily, and checked in on us numerous times.  We'd ask them for more of \"this\" (and point to it) and it was quickly rushed over to us.  They even showed us how to mix our sauce.  I haven't had service this attentive in months - that's how good it was.  The menu was AYCE - which is great since you can fit in a surprising amount of this type of fare (guilt-free mind you, it's all very healthy). It was a total vegetarian heaven (AYCE was $19.99 for me).  For my SO and mum - the carnivores, they each paid ($14.99 - makes no sense since they can have vegetarian options AND meat but whatever).    The broths come in one large pot with a divider down the middle.  A bunch of broths are included in your price, and you can upgrade for $5 to some specific flavours.  On one side we had Tom Yum for an additional $5 (had seafood in it so well worth it) and the other side was a tomato based vegetarian.  We ordered copious amounts of food.  There were incredible and entirely new vegetarian options, including gluten (aka Seitan?), bean curd rolls, various tofus, vegetables, fungi, and a dozen other treats.  I noticed meat options like pig blood, various organs, and ..... er..... well other things that are delicious to people other than me!  To help you out here is what you do:  1) Take small bowl and put some of every condiment in it (it comes on a huge tray).  We liked a few spoons of satay and a lot of peanut sauce in it.  Fill it up with soy sauce and mix it up nicely.  2) If you have hair, put it back.  This is going to get serious.  3) Take your food (whether it be tofu, veggie, or meat) and dump it in.  Not all at once mind you - because if you leave your beef in there for too long it will be a rubbery mess.  I prefer to over-cook my taro and yams, but that's just me.    4) After a few minutes (or seconds, whatever) fish it out with either the little basket-spoon or your chopsticks and put it in the large bowl.  5) Give it a good solid dip in your sauce.  6) Shove it down your gullet.  7) Repeat.   This is my Chinese version of comfort food.  I can stuff my face and not feel sluggish or greasy after eating here, and it warms you up on so many levels (hot, spicy, steamy...).  It's a great activity to do with a few friends (or a dozen friends - they have the huge lazy susan tables too).  So, if any one ever wants to come here - just call me! (and offer me door to door service - this place is far!!)  HIGHLY recommended - and open from 5pm to 5am daily!  I will be using my pregnancy powers to come here often (potentially in the middle of the night if need be).  BTW - unlike other reviews for other hot pot places, our clothes did not reek after leaving here.  Perhaps better ventilation?"}
{"text":"My group of 11 really liked our experience here. We sat in a round table with three stove tops so we had three pots of soup with two soup bases each. Nice. Easier to converse this way then to have a really long table where you can't hear the other person.   The food here was pretty good. Wide variety of soup bases, some are premium bases $5 each but if you sigh in via yelp, you get one free soup base. My side got the special soup base, and the mushroom and bone soup base. Both were really good. The ingredients were fresh, lots of variety, ranging from roots such as yam and taro, to meats such as beef,. chicken, lamb, pork (all really fresh), to balls such as squid, beef and pork all fresh not frozen, to veggies, to others such as wontons, mini pork buns, frozen tofu, and a wide selection of carbs.   Price was $18 without seafood option and after tax and tip was about $24 pp. As others mentioned, only water or hot Chinese tea is included in the meal. The place is pretty clean, food, restaurant, and bathrooms included. There maybe other places with better value but overall we had a good time. Service was fast although by the 5th round, they only brought in half the portion of the meat we requested because they didn't believe we could finish it. We had to order more and wait for a couple mins but it was okay."}
{"text":"Yeah, don't go here.  It looks really dirty, we found 2 snails on the vegetable leaves, which means they weren't washed or weren't washed properly.  Found a bug near the sauces too.   Really don't like how the pots are shared.  Really really don't like that I got food poisoning from eating here, probably because the pots were shared, which makes it hard to control what goes in/out of the pots.  Ruined the hotpot experience for me."}
{"text":"The ventilation is much better than standard hot pot restaurants. As well, the service isn't bad; servers pro-actively circulated the tables to fill our chrysanthemum teas and the hot water for our pots. Onto the food.  The food selection wasn't bad. Their \"hand-beaten beef\" is one of my favourites as it is very tender and soaks up sauce well. I also enjoy their \"alcohol-dipped chicken wings.\" The food wasn't bad at all, but I stayed away from the seafood deal in which everyone talked negatively about. I didn't get the impression that the vegetables were dirty or any of the food was poorly prepared. However, 2 of my family members had cramps afterwards which may be from over-eating or having squid (which the rest of us did not have). So just keep that in mind.  The soup bases were intriguing. I rather liked the tomato corn soup which goes well with a lot of meats or vegetables. The soya milk one is interesting too, but it's not extremely flavourable for everyone. However, I liked the milkyish taste.  Honestly, I have been to Kim Dao before and I had terrible service for the last 2 times. I've also been to Rolling Pot and iCook or something at Warden and Steeles, Doh Heung at Commerce and another Little Fat Sheep or something (lol). All of them were over-humid and the tables were sticky even before we ordered the hot pot base! Some of the other hot pot places have pretty messy food preparation ..so in comparison, 100 Degrees isn't bad."}
{"text":"Food is okay.   lots of variety of food."}
{"text":"Love this place as prices are reasonable and it opens late! Like 5 am late! Discount for meals after 11pm."}
{"text":"Pretty good! All you can eat. Open late. Service isn't great but I didn't expect anything amazing. They have TVs showing Chinese dramas which is nice to watch. Nicer than your average hotpot restaurant. Only complaints are that they charge for tea and it doesn't help that it is freezing in the restaurant. I had to eat with my jacket on."}
{"text":"Sorry but compared to Kim Tao Hot Pot this place is not that great.  The service, like what others said was actually really good and by far the best. They listened to our requests since we had a vegetarian and vegan-ish person with us. The dessert I find was better than Kim Tao Hot Pot but everything else was sub par.  Some of the meat was already cooked when given to us which defeats the purpose. Also the vegetarian option is actually more expensive and the \"special\" veggie stuff is only a one time thing (Kim Tao Hot Pot allows AYCE on those as well). Also the drink was really bland. Although they do have  alot of selection for other drinks but you have to pay.  The plating was a little better than Kim Tao Hot Pot but overall Kim Tao Hot Pot is better hands down. I would probably never come back here again (first and last) and just stick to Kim Tao Hot Pot.  One more thing, the sauces at Kim Tao Hot Pot are better and the sauces are less \"out of the bottle\" sauces. Everything here seemed like it was just out of the bottle. Might as well just do it at home."}
{"text":"hot pot ayce = nothing special... don't think i'll be back.  service was good though."}
{"text":"I'm very late in writing my reviews for the Toronto restaurants I visited while I was on my trip there, but if I recall correctly, after I checked in at 100 Degrees Hot Pot on Yelp Mobile, which automatically posted a status updated of it on my Facebook, one of my friends commented on the Facebook post that 100 Degrees Hot Pot is a winner on the strength of its name alone.  I thought it's a pretty cool name, too, but I was going to reserve my judgement until I've actually eaten.  And I'm happy to say that the restaurant didn't disappoint.  Several different sauces for the broth was available for us to choose, and they had a good variety of meats, vegetables, and other hot pot ingredients that were fresh.  Altogether there were seven of us at dinner, we were eating for eight, because my cousin-in-law was there, and he is one of the biggest Chinese dudes I've ever seen and can eat twice the amount of the average man.  I did not find out until my cousin-in-law ordered three different kinds of dessert at the end of dinner that this restaurant was all-you-can-eat.  He ordered three desserts and I looked at him with an expression that a man might have on his face when he is staring right into the abyss of an unstoppable black hole that sucks in all the mass around him.  But luckily I wasn't facing down my inevitable doom by sitting two seats away from a black hole.  It's just that 100 Degrees Hot Pot is all-you-can-eat."}
{"text":"Went here for Dinner just to try it. Their price is a little steep considering that you have to pay for almost everything, including your drinks. The AYCE selection is limited and they don't give you as wide a selection of ingredients to make your marinade. The menu is overwhelming for a hot pit place and took us about 15 minutes to figure out what was going on. Food was ok. On par with most other hot pot places. Service could use some improvement, it was slow and took forever to get things started and wrapped up at the end. It was a mediocre experience; but go to Kim Tao Hot Pot two blocks north. Probably won't be going back to 100 Degrees again."}
{"text":"It was a cold and snowy evening when I went to 100 Degrees with my friends, so it was an ideal setting for hot pot.  We arrived as a group of 11 (and we had made reservations ahead of time), but turns out they don't have that many large tables so we had to be seated at two separate tables.   This was kind of a bummer, since part of the enjoyment of hot pot is the communal aspect of eating and being able to chat with your friends - while everyone fights for the last fish ball.  The service was good, they were quick and attentive through out the evening; coming round to top off the pots and also our glasses with water.  The good part about this place is that they have a tray of condiments ready at your table (with a pretty good selection as well, including raw eggs), so you can start concocting your sauce immediately.  My table tried the following soup bases: preserved egg and cilantro/satay and preserved egg and cilantro/corn and pork bone.  The soups were very standard, if not a little bland.  The selection of foods was pretty average, they had all the standard items although were missing some staples like enoki mushrooms.  The quality of the food was hit and miss.  Their veggies were fresh, dumplings were average and their lamb was decent.  However, their beef (after the first plate) was noticeably freezer burned.  Finally, the only drink you get here is water.  We asked if they provided the plum juice or anything else with the meal, and the answer was no.  Overall, I would go to other places like Hi Pot that have a better selection of foods and at least offers one drink with your meal."}
{"text":"Drive for 2 more minutes up north to Kim tao.  This place doesn't compare.  Soup base is the most important for hot pot,  but all 4 I tried was bland and tasteless..  Sour and not spicy Tom yum soup?  Definitely not worth the extra 5$ you have to pay for.   The best part of my meal is 15$/dozen oysters.  How can you screw that up?  Well the oysters was covered in sand so whoever shucked it didn't wash the oysters or the knife.  Selection for food sucks.  Never again."}
{"text":"If I just rate the services and the staffs, it is the best I had experienced from all these AYCE hot pot restaurants. 4 star! The staffs even asked me how's the food sounded like they care...  Food... Food is their problem...   The \"Hot and Spicy\" Szechuan soup base was pathetic. There are no peppercorns... nothing really hot or numbing. They just put the bottled garlic and chili as the main ingredients....  We had the Fatty Beef and Seafood set ($21.95). Don't order the Seafood platter... for extra $5 really doesn't worth it!! The mussel and surf clam are both really rubbery... and the oyster on the small size...   Our first round of beef looked pretty good but when the second round the beef has this deep dark red colour...   The vegetables not too fresh and definitely not wash properly...  I can go on and on and on.....   Though it is open from 5 pm to 5 am, I don't think I want to come back again....   BTW, how come there's no lobster!!   *10% service already added to the total bill  * Accepts Credit Cards payment"}
