{"text":"Phenomenal to say the least. Our server was excellent. Our food was excellent. Atmosphere was top notch. What can I say that can't be answered by the food and experience. If you happen to be looking for Italian food, do yourself a favor and come check this place out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is by far my husband's favorite restaurant. He gets the veal parmesan and loves it. I love the Lisa's salad and wedding soup. Actually have tried many things off the menu and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"The staff treats you like family. Very attentive.   The food is delicious.   The pizza is outstanding.  This is at the top of our list."}
{"text":"FABULOUS !  Enjoyed a wonderful dinner with hubby for my bday.  He had the veal meatballs special and I had Lasagna.  We had the wedding soup before dinner.   Everything was delicious.  Best Italian dinner I have ever had.  The staff were friendly, dinner came out quick, they even offered a complimentary slice of cake and a small sugar cookie.  Generous portion of wine; house Pinot Noir was awesome. Highly recommend this restaurant.  We are from Columbus.  I can see us making a special trip to come back to experience this place again.  Great birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Lunched at Mario Fazios yesterday. Typical Italian restaurant. Food was good. Had the GF pizza and it was very tasty and cooked to perfection. Had a side salad with the Lisa's dressing. The dressing is a must. They have a new menu since the last time I was there and prices appear to have been raised significantly. Environment is noisy with the tables packed close together. All attendees enjoyed their meals but we're not awed."}
{"text":"We made reservations, and it was VERY unorganized when we arrived, people who came after us and who didnt have reservations were seated, they finally remembered and they seated us.The owner ( I think) was giving everyone wine while we were wating which was nice. Once we got past the bad check in, everything else was great! I really enjoyed the wedding soup and the lemon chicken! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow, where do I start. We sat down right away, service was very polite and quick. I was able to sample some wine before purchasing. The fried provolone appetizer was delicious. Its a fried circular disc of cheese served with basil and tomatoes, served right out of the oven. Entrees are big and, again, served hot right from the oven. To finish it off, you're treated with a small slice of their homemade cake. I think this is a Mario Fazio's staple. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place wins for customer service. Tonight we ordered take out. Husband drove 20 minutes to pick it up. As we unpacked the bags, we discovered that we received a wrong item. Instead of receiving calamari, we got fried mozzarella. My husband called just to let them know about the goof and they offered to deliver the right item. We tried to beg them off but they pretty much insisted.  This level of customer service is almost unheard of today. We are more than impressed now and always. Well done, Mario Fazio's."}
{"text":"At the ripe old age of 91, my dad passed away this past Valentines Day. We held his funeral mass and burial the next day and scrambled to locate an establishment that could accommodate our family and friends for a gathering after the rites. Mario Fazios came through with flying colors! The staff seamlessly provided a family style dining experience that included apps, soup, salad, an entree with a pasta side, roasted veggies and a dessert. WOW! Our group raved about the delicious offerings and the attentive staff. We plan to revisit the restaurant for an evening out sometime soon. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Mario Fazio's is excellent. The customer service is wonderful! I highly recommend the Lisa Salad and the Lemon chicken. It's truly the best Italian food in town!"}
{"text":"I love their food. their garlic bread is terrific, and salads and wedding soup are great! very authentic. their lemon chicken is phenominal, and my favorite is the lasagna. the meat sauce is awesome, and I love the ricotta cheese, adds to it greatly! hope they never change it. the servers are very sweet and professional. their complimentary small piece of cassata cake they give you for dessert is yummy. only thing they could improve, they give you plastic bottles of pop, refills aren't free. everything else is grest though"}
{"text":"Came here the other day to get dinner. This is a very homely restaurant that has great service, great food and great prices.   I ordered the Doreen's which is a pasta dish with meatballs and sausage. Just awesome. Our server was very friendly and polite too.   They serve a lite dessert after dinner main dinner entree on the house. Superb ! It's a rare find to have a restaurant that cares about customers as much as about running the business.   Will visit again and must place for anyone in this part of town."}
{"text":"OMG.  I only give a 5 star rating if a restaurant really wows me, and OH MY GOD, I love this place.  This is such a step up from Olive Garden.  Our waitress Stacy was very friendly and attentive, but not overly so.  She knew the specials without looking at a piece of paper and refilled my water at least twice.  She's great!  Dinner started with garlic bread and some Italian salsa spread, which was really good.  You don't have to worry about filling up on bread either, because our salads and entrees came probably in under 10 minutes!  I upgraded to the Lisa salad for an extra $2.50, and It was worth the upcharge!  It comes with grapes, strawberries, candied walnuts, and crumbled cheese (gorgonzola?) with strawberry vinaigrette.  Then, before I could even finish my salad, our entrees were ready super fast!  I had the lemon chicken with cavatelli. SO amazing, and such BIG portions.  That is when I knew I was in love.  I didn't think it could get any better.  But it did.  After requesting a box for my leftovers (which they package so nicely for you!), Stacy brought out a complimentary cassata cake sample.  As soon as she set it down, with one look, we immediately ordered a full piece ($7).  It was glorious.  I am already planning my next trip"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to have lunch and celebrate two birthdays among our group of fourteen.  I could not be more pleased that we ended up at Mario Fazio's.  They were so accommodating and helpful.  Everything was perfect.  The service was excellent and the food delicious.  And to top everything off, they made a beautiful fall-themed cassata cake, the perfect ending to a perfect birthday celebration."}
{"text":"Having spent time in Italy, we are usually a little disappointed when trying a US Italian restuarant.  So, when recently in Ohio, we heard that Marios was amazing.  IT WAS AMAZING.  Luckily, my husband called ahead for reservations as they were packed with a line waiting (always a sign of great food).  The hostess was super friendly and the waitress very attentive.  The place is very nice inside, and very welcoming.  The three of us had: lasagna, carbonara, and their house sammys pasta.  All three dishes were delicious! The \"taste\" of their strawberry cassata cake they give you was to die for! A wonderful dining experience that we will look forward to having on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"The food here is great and it shows by the packed room every night. Best cassata cake I've ever had and it is free!  I want to say, i had them cater  an event. I wanted something affordable, but quality I could count on. The food was fabulous and plentiful. They were great and let me change me order up to 48 hrs before.  People on the phone were very pleasant and they delivered it right on time. They saved my event."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things; very impressed with their service and food.  With only a day's notice they really came through for our family with a beautiful memorial dinner after the sudden loss of a young loved one.  The staff, food, and atmosphere was all excellent and extremely professional.  Everything you could want in a delicate situation."}
{"text":"Everything I have tried here has been awesome. The lemon chicken is the best around hands down. Everyone was very polite and the service was great."}
{"text":"Delicious. Great meatballs; best in Cleveland. Lemon chicken; oh my.  Pasta cooked to perfection. My bourbon iced with big ice cubes. Friendly service. Can't wait to have clam appetizer again. I'll never go anywhere else for Italian food."}
{"text":"Great food and family owned restaurant. If you like good home cooked Italian food. This is the place for you. I love the chicken Parmesan and the garlic bread. Some good wine choices. Great place to take the family or mom on her birthday. We truly enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"Italian restaurant located off Chardon rd in Willoughby hills. I'm guessing they have been around for 25years or more. I like that is locally owned & the offer catering. Over the years I've been here & have always has a good experience. The bread & \"Italian salsa\" they offer w/ meals is great. The prices are slightly high but won't stop me from being back. Over all I recommend Mario Fazios"}
{"text":"Good...but not as special or as good as Mama Catena or Gaetano's.  Side salad was good..nice addition with chickpeas and beets.  Penne with vodka sauce was fair...nothing blew me away.  The Italian salsa that was served with the bread was stone cold...yuck.  Baked meatball appetizer was good and the cheese on those meatballs I give 10/10.  They throw in a slice of cassata cake with entrees.  Again, good in a pedestrian way but not great.  Service was attentive and friendly.  This place lacks the true family feel you get at Mama Catena as well as the food quality you get there."}
{"text":"Have been coming to Cleveland for nearly 18 years and am sad to say I just found thus place. Thank you to yelp for pointing me this way.  To start with I was dining alone so I thought of eating at the bar . Turns out there is none but they were more than accommodating in the dining room.  Had the calamari first. Meals come with choice of soup or salad so I had the soup. 2 choices In and both great. Main meal was baked penne with sausage and meatballs . Took 3 bites and was stuffed. Asked for it to go. Then comes the chaser.....cake....really moist and light .  Did not see a single soul leave here without food wrapped to go so if you are looking for big portions this sis your place.  Very friendly staff that worked excellently as a team. Never missing a beat.   Very nice dining experience and I will come back next time in town."}
{"text":"This was the best service I've had in my adult life! Brittany was an amazing, knowledgeable, and friendly server. She went above and beyond from start(letting us know the specials and giving recommendations) to finish(bringing the kids complimentary fresh fruit, giving suggestions for my sons allergies, and bringing a toy bucket to our table) astronomical service Brittany! Oh and let's not forget the food--beyond my expectations. We even bought some salsa and salad dressing to go. I will be back often and will suggest for other people to go!! Not to mention my mom is in town from Texas and in the when Brittany first came to our table she asked what we're celebrating and I told her that my mom was in town from Texas and she bought my moms wine for her and told her to have a safe trip on our way out the door. Small details like that are not normal anymore. Food and service was the bees knees!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the Veggie pizza. It is one of my favorites and have even requested my boyfriend order it on my birthday (I don't get it too often as it cost almost $30 FOR A PIZZA!)  However, we had planned a small gathering there a few years ago after my uncle had passed away and our whole family was disappointed. We had planned on going there after the calling hours at the funeral home down the street. We were told by the restaurant that we would have a small room or section of the restaurant. When we showed up (I think it was a Tuesday evening), the place was packed and we did not have a small section as promised. My aunt was visibly upset as she wanted a nice family dinner in memory of her husband. When my other aunt tried to talk to the owner, she (the owner) was extremely rude and condescending, calling my aunt \"honey\". She did not even try to accommodate our party even though we had made arrangements days ahead of time.   For this reason alone, I am giving the restaurant 3 stars. Decent food but very unprofessional owners and management."}
{"text":"I was working in the area and went out for dinner without realizing it was Valentines Day.  My server was very friendly and I was seated very quickly.    I started with a bowl of Italian Wedding Soup that was okay.  It was tasty but seemed to be missing something.  It could be that there was no escarole or greens in the soup.  The house salad consisted of mixed greens, chick peas, green peas, shredded beets and carrots. I thought the house balsamic vinaigrette was good.    The real kicker was the entree.   It is very difficult to find a clam dish in Ohio and they two.  I has a dish of steamed clams with sausage over linguine in a garlic wine sauce.  It was very good.    All in all, I will come back again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"This is the place where the locals eat and if I were local I would be eating here often. Best Italian wedding soup I've had. A real Italian restaurant with reasonable prices and great portions along with some of the nicest people in the industry."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Recently moved here from Los Angeles and Im so happy to have a great Italian restaurant nearby!  Love the pizza and the cassata cake is the best!  Lisa the owner is always super friendly and helpful too.  Have gone back often and look forward to many more visits in the future!"}
{"text":"Knocked the handling of my sisters baby shower out of the park. Lisa Fazio is a complete professional and seems to legitimately care. Lemon chicken is out of this world. Highly recommended for events."}
{"text":"Celebrated my Mom's 90 birthday last night. The waitress Marissa was exceptional! The food was suburb. Thank you Mario Fazio's for a great meal and very nice celebration dinner!"}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp today, as I wanted to take my gf out for a nice lunch. The place was packed, but I think that had more to do with the fact the had a memorial service crowd there at the time. The staff were very attentive and the service was excellent. There were fresh red carnations on the table...nice touch, clean and attractive surroundings. We are not big eaters, so we split the cheese ravioli with mushrooms and a wonderful sauce and Asiago cheese shredded on top. It was amazing. I also got one of my favorite soups...Italian Wedding soup...it was very good. My girlfriend got a side Caesar salad that was a nice plate for being a side.  The prices were more than I expected. Our singular ravioli entree was was $14. This was a lunch price, so I'm assuming the dinner prices are higher...most restaurants are. But...you are paying for high quality, homemade food that is exceptional. With that I give this fine restaurant five stars."}
{"text":"This is the third year in a row that our Christmas party has been catered by Mario Fazios. They are easy to work with and their food is always consistently amazing. Each year, more people come to eat because they've heard or tasted how good it's been. We have 3 different salads, a vegetarian option (eggplant parmigiana), beef Marsala and a breaded lemon chicken. Their green beans side is so amazing! I like green beans anyway, but theirs have olive oil, Parmesan and tomatoes--SO delicious. And those au gratin potatoes? Are you kidding me? I could eat those and the green beans as a meal. Yum! They also serve cavatelli and their meatballs which are also tasty. I'm so full right now--mostly because I had a little of everything--that I skipped the dessert trays laden with Christmas cookies, brownies and other small-bite desserts. I highly recommend them for both service and quality of food."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! Super friendly staff. The food here is to die for. The risotto,oh my lord! The food is so fresh,the portions are huge. U even get a complimentary slice of heavenly cossatta cake. They have a private room for large groups. Absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"I knew before we arrived, from studying the creative menu, that this was no ordinary Italian restaurant.  That impression was reinforced when we arrived and saw a packed parking lot.  Once inside, we were not disappointed.  The reception and wait staff could not have been more hospitable (thank you, Danielle for taking such good care of us).  We started with pizza appetizers, and this was simply the best pizza I have ever had, and that's something for a Chicagoan to say, as we have a few notables in that category back home.  I had the Sammy's Sunday sauce, made with ribs vs. usual beef, plus veal meat balls.  It was spectacularly delicious, as was every dish those in our group ordered.   One of our guests put it best:  \"if I lived near here, I would be here all the time.\"  (Appears the locals are.)  The cocktails are creative and extremely generous in size.  Desserts, same.  Those of a certain age will remember the Fazio food chain in Cleveland;  family member Mario (now passed on), started this fabulous place years ago, and his charismatic and hard-working daughter Lisa has kept the tradition not just alive, but vibrant and growing.  She is a 4th generation restaurateur, and come to find out her college age children are studying the trade as well.  Wow, how many businesses make it to the second generation?  Now, here, five?   This is a special group of people.  In sum:  Not to be missed, and worth the drive east.  Five stars."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and all paid for by work.  The staff here is wonderful, very friendly and helpful.  Even if they're busy, you never feel it and the service is wonderful.  We typically get to try pizza, soup, salad, at least 3 types of pasta and some sort of house dessert, all of which are delicious.  if you're vegetarian or have some sort of allergy, they're very accommodating.  I love how they do their salads and their pasta is wonderful!    Cute little place, especially if you don't want to he'd into the city"}
{"text":"I've been going to Mario's for years and am always amazed how it always seem to rise to the ocassion.  The menu offerings are the creation of Lisa Fazio, daughter of the founder, Mario.  Since she is almost always there, the food quality is consistent and the service is generally perfect.  It's always a pleasure to go to Mario's."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time Friday night. Carlos was amazing as were the rest of the staff- wonderful service all around.  We ordered the primavera and the Roma pizza to share w/ calamari as an app. Everything was fantastic. The primavera could have used more veggies in my opinion but the pasta was perfectly cooked and just creamy enough without drowning in it.   The atmosphere is cute and intimate, somewhere where you could be casual or dress up a little more fora nice evening out. Will def be going back. We went a bit earlier on a Friday night b/c of a 7:30 show we were trying to catch, so we were possibly the youngest diners by about 25 years, but a younger crowd was starting as we were leaving."}
{"text":"Food was great service was great our waitress was always there when we needed something.. table we sat at for 6 people was a little in small side... other then that no conplaints"}
{"text":"Mario Fazio's is brought to my place of employment at least twice monthly. This week we got lucky and it was served twice.I've dined in the restaurant itself only twice. However, I've had the pleasure of devouring their food countless times outside of the actual restaurant space... thank you pharmaceutical reps.   Their food is simply delicious. I'm not a huge fan of Italian restaurants so coming from me, that's really saying something.   As I was told by the owner herself, all of the ingredients are top quality and everything is homemade fresh daily.   If you decide to check out Mario Fazio's, their Lisa's Salad is an absolute must try and a staple at their restaurant. Fresh spring mix, grapes, candied walnuts, and gorgonzola topped with their special dressing. It's one of the best salads you'll ever eat.   They have some really great pizzas, pastas, appetizers, and desserts as well."}
{"text":"Great food and A+ customer service. Toy box treats for the kids and a delicious free desert for all when the meal ends. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love this Place. I originally ate here for a friends wedding rehearsal and food was awesome. We had lemon chicken, meat balls, Lisa's salad, lasagna and more. I had to have my wife taste it, so went back a second time and it was even better. This time I got the Chicken Parm and Lisa's salad which is a must. The service was amazing. I had never been to a restaurant where the owner came and greeted tables and told me \"if there is anything you'd like that's not on the menu, let us know and I'm sure we could make it for your liking\". This went down in my books as my Favorite Italian Restaurant here near Cleveland."}
{"text":"I give it 5+, linen table clothes & napkins; excellent homemade pasta & sauces, family owned & operated ... Excellent food at fair price. Full bar & good wine selection.  It's always worth the drive!  Lisa Fazio always remember us ... we've had some great imported Italian wines here ... best to ask the hostess to get the best for your palate."}
{"text":"My story. Was a guest at a wedding rehearsal dinner. Half of us got seriously ill. Thank god wedding was not next day. We needed to recover. Diarrhea, vomiting , the works. I never will go back."}
{"text":"We took my son and his family there for his birthday. Our family included a 3 year old and a 7 month old. Everyone was extremely family friendly, even bringing our granddaughter a cup of applesauce with other finger foods. Our server was Melissa and she was over the top excellent!!! The atmosphere was real Italian and the food was simply delicious. I am Italian and extremely particular about eating at an Italian restaurant. We were not disappointed. The portions of food were extremely generous. And they served us, on the house, a beautiful dessert cake and cupcake to celebrate our son's special day. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Don't come here for the white table cloths or a five star, fine dining experience. Come here if you want the experience of eating at a \"kitschy\" Cleveland, family owned Italian restaurant - I love it. Lets talk about the service: the service is fast. They serve salads and soups and all meals off of a roller-wheeled, double decker cart - go Cleveland.  The food is served on plastic, floral plates (kitschy). It's served piping hot with cute waitresses that smile. Let's talk about the food: the food is good. I recommend the Pasta Bolognese. Everytime I'm here, there's always a table of Red Hat ladies or old folks enjoying a large group dining experience. How cool is that? Mario Fazio's family-style Italian says it all!!"}
{"text":"Great Italian spot!  Good date spot or a casual lunch.  My son had the chicken Parmesan and I had the cedar salad with 2 slices of fig pizza.  Nom, Nom, Nom!  Would definitely recommend this place for excellent Italian food.  We would also definitely  come back if are ever back in the Cleveland area!  Prices were very reasonable as well!"}
{"text":"Fancy, fantastic, friendly, and family, but not too Upper- class. Food is great. Husband loved the Linguine with Clam Sauce and I was in ecstasy over the best pizza I've ever tasted.  We will be back to celebrate special occasions. Four stars only because it is rather pricey at dinner. Lunch menu seemed very reasonable."}
{"text":"I should realized that ordering a pasta with rib meat and sauce would make it watery. Garlic bread was awesome. Service is impeccable from moment of arrival to departure.  I might return and try a different pasta"}
{"text":"Food was very good and the service was very good but there was an.. amiability(?) that really knocked my socks off.  Wife had the braciole and I had the lemon chicken, 5 year old son had a kids cheese pizza, all wonderful. The side salad was such a pleasant little atypical salad: shredded beets chick peas, (regular) peas, salad greens. Profiteroles for dessert: the spumoni was killer. Espresso afterward: I've had espressos across the US france and northern europe (though admittedly not Italy) and this one was just a fine example of the species. I immediately ordered a second one and split it with my 5 year old son, which probably wasn't that smart but it gave me a great reason to have a second shot. Bloody mary was good too (green olives, celery). We had no reservation and dropped in on a not too busy friday night. we were promptly seated and I, an inveterate grouch, was immediately disarmed. Ross (our waiter) catered to my kid like I was a millionaire but made it seem like he was a cousin. I went so far as to drag the house manager Lisa Fazio out and tell her much I enjoyed it and now I'm telling you. I'm gonna take my italian mother-in-law there for mother's day"}
{"text":"Pricey but delicious and worth every penny ! If you want REAL amazing delectable Italian food, you have to go here. The salad with the strawberry vinaigrette dressing, strawberries and caramelized pecans is my favorite.you also must try. A home made cannoli ! I have had them cater to a number of family events as well!"}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate my mothers birthday recently and I have to say it is one of the best restaurants I have been to in a very long time.  It is a traditional family style Italian restaurant with great food and service.  They really made us feel at home.  I ordered the famous lemon chicken which was outstanding one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had.  We all enjoyed our food including lasagna, veal Parmesan, wedding soup, and cassata cake.  They even brought my mom a beautiful cupcake to celebrate her birthday.  I recommend making a reservation if you go on the weekend because they fill up very quickly."}
{"text":"We went here with our family to honor a family member who had passed. It was bright cheerful and very accommodating. The wait staff were amazing. I can't compliment them enough. The food was delicious. It was served family style and consisted of fresh garlic bread. Home made pizza , which was similar to Sicilian style. It was then followed by Italian wedding soup and a bountiful salad. The main course consisted of chicken parmigiana, roasted fall root vegetables with artichoke hearts, fresh cut green beans with warmed bread crumbs on top, and cavatellis in a marina sauce. Each dish was served family style and hot. After such a tremendous feast in honor of our patriarch, we were offered coffee and cassata cake.  It was truly a beautiful and kind atmosphere with family, memories and a great staff that were true professionals. I highly recommend them for a formal event or lunch or dinner. Thank you"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Had the lemon chicken with broccoli.  Staying at a local hotel and ordered the food for pickup.  Everything was ready when I arrived and the hostess was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I cannot imagine anyone giving this restaurant less than three stars. The star truly here is the food and the service.  The Food: The Lisa Salad and Grilled Chicken are good but the Market is my favorite with fresh quality ingredients and a unique concept!  The pizza is the best here! The crust is something amazing and my favorite pizza is the Annie's pizza. The Genoa was very good too. The best part is that when you want to split a pizza with your red sauce loving husband, they will split your pizza and making a white and red pizza!   Oh and the Cassata Cake...I have never had goodness like that before! Seriously words cannot describe that cake!  I need to try and recreate it but I can tell you I could never make it as good!   They look to have really good appetizers and other entrees and house pasta specialties.   The Service The waiters and waitresses are very nice and friendly and attentive. A very good family feeling in this place.  The Ambiance This would be the one area that they could improve on. It is corny Italy, but the atmosphere has some good areas that they could just classify (is that a word?!) and improve upon.   A MUST stop!"}
{"text":"Excellent traditional Italian dining.  Extremely professional and friendly staff.  Calamari the best; fresh homemade sauce."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was great. It was a nice friendly atmosphere. We really like the cassata cake as well. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Buzzing, hopping, packed, popular. Get the picture? Amongst a little cluster of restaurants, Mario Fazio's was clearly the top choice of pretty much everybody in the room. My date recommended it with the caveat that nothing had changed since the 70s but upon arrival, we found a renovation (at least he thought so, it didn't feel dated at all).  Seated, ordered, served. The spicy stuffed pepper was deeeelish and not too spicy at all. My veal parm (yes I ate veal, what of it!) had the perfect amount of cheese and the tastiest, most pillowy pasta and his salmon he said, was very good. Two glasses of chianti, two lovely slices of cake, a split coffee gelato and we were set. There's a good amount of food, we definitely didn't leave hungry, but the prices were just a bit on the steep side for what it was. Still, obviously they do everything right because on a Saturday night, it was rockin' and you could tell the people were there for the 10th, 20th and maybe 50th time. I love a place with regulars.   The staff were all incredibly friendly from the first greeting to the chorus of \"thank you\"s and \"goodbye\"s as we were leaving. It's a haul from the west side but you'll be ok."}
{"text":"Loved the food, the service & hospitality! Our server Stacy was so friendly & wonderfully sweet! Ann came out from the back room to greet us & was super friendly as well! Definitely try the Sammys Sunday special & save room for dessert & the homemade ice cream!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have passed this place so many times and never tried them which turns  out to have been a huge mistake.  It is fabulous - absolutely no complaints about anything.  Service was wonderful.  My husband had Lisa's Salad and highly recommends it.  The prices are a little  higher than we expected from a neighborhood restaurant but it is well worth the difference.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Our favorite Cleveland spot - delicious food and amazing services. We had the Annie's gluten free pizza, eggplant terrine, wedding soup, salmon, and the veal meatballs. All of them were so delicious! One of the best gluten free pizza's I've ever had. Make sure you save room for dessert too."}
{"text":"On our trip to visit relatives in Willoughby, my mother in-law took us here to celebrate son's birthday.    The restaurant interior is nice and has a warm atmosphere.  The owner Lisa came in and visited each table, which was very nice.    The bread and dip they brought out before our order was SO delicious, I'd go back for that alone!  We had a hard time not eating all the bread and dip as not to ruin our appetites for dinner.  They sell the salsa bread dip at the front as well.  I had the Crabby Paddy salad which had two crab-cakes about 3\" round.  It was pretty good and filled me perfectly.    Since it was my son's birthday, they brought us each a little slice of vanilla cake and my son's had a candle in it, the wait-staff sang him happy birthday and some patrons also sang along.  It was all very nicely done and I'd go again."}
{"text":"Food is always good, love the Lisa Salad. Only drawback is that service can be slow."}
{"text":"I love Italian cuisine! I've had my fair share over my lifetime, but last week I had the best ever! I am on Yelp to shout it to the world because this place is not to be missed. The menu is awesome, the food absolutely delicious, the service fast and friendly, and the ambiance is perfect. I went with a group of 14 and everyone was thrilled by this culinary experience. I ordered my favorite, chicken parmagiana, and it was A+++. Now for the bad news....I'm an out-of-towner and live 2,000  miles away. :("}
{"text":"The staff and management are friendly and go above and beyond to make sure that you have an enjoyable dining experience. On this occasion, the first time that the food wasn't quite what I was expecting, my waitress immediately showed concerned and offered to rectify the situation immediately. The kitchen offered to fix me something else to replace the other item, although I told them this was not  necessary."}
{"text":"I went here last night for take out. We ordered a cheese pizza for my youngest, plus 3 chicken parms. I asked for extra sauce and they actually charged me for $5 for a pint of sauce. I wasn't too happy... The total bill came to $65 which is a bit pricey.  Then, they forgot my sauce and I didn't notice until I got home. So I called. They were very nice about it and actually sent someone to my home to deliver it. That was nice.  Even with the expense, the overall experience was great! The staff was super friendly and the food was really tasty. Dinners come with garlic bread and a great cake (cassata I think). Overall it was very good."}
{"text":"First time going to Mario Fazio's. I chose it because of the great reviews on the web...which are right on. My friend had lasagna with Italian wedding soup and I had the lunch special which was a chicken cutlet and baby arugula salad with a side of spaghetti . We were both happy with our choices. The little slice of cake at the end they give you was delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing food ! Owner is so sweet ! Get the pasta with veal and meatballs - the cassata cake they bring out at the end is amazing ! You will never leave here hungry"}
{"text":"Best Italian in the Cleveland area. Always exceptional service and great food with big portions. I've had both the carbonara and the veal parmesan. Both are absolutely amazing. The veal is tender, with a light slightly crispy breading that is among the best I've had. The meals come with a salad, but I always upgrade to the unbelievable Lisa's salad, which everyone in my party always loves. You get a small sample of cassata cake for desert as well along with your entre, which is also exceptional. It's a cozy place, great for dates or a family dinner. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went there tonight as a party of 6 for my mom's birthday. Our server was Stacy and she was very attentive. Lisa, the owner, stopped by a couple of times to check on everything. We've been eating there since I was a little kid. (In fact, they didn't even have a high chair or booster seat that first time - I had dinner on a stack of phone books!)  Anyways,  back to tonight. I had the lemon chicken and opted for wheat pasta instead of the cavatelli. I also had the salad with their house Balsamic Italian dressing. Besides the shredded beets on the salad (ugh), everything was delicious! The rest of my family enjoyed their meals as well, since everyone took home a doggy bag (except Dad, who ate all of his veal parmigiano). Bread was plentiful, water was refilled several times, and at the end of our meal, Stacy came out with a Cassatta cupcake for my mom and the rest of us were given thin slices of Cassatta cake. The wait staff sang \"Happy Birthday\" and all the patrons burst into applause at the end, both tickling and embarrassing my mom.  Overall, it was a terrific experience and I would highly recommend this wonderful restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Always a great meal!! The complimentary garlic bread and homemade salsa they serve is always fresh and flavorful...yum!!  Not sure what the salad's name is, but definitely try the one with blue cheese and strawberries...so good!  Save room for dessert! We always have the complimentary cassata sample...and then take a full sized piece home with us.  Also, if you are ordering anything from the catering menu...be sure to try their Mediterranean Lasagna. They don't have it on their dine-in menu, so I had no clue it existed. SO good."}
{"text":"Went here after a YMCA swim meet.  We called last week to make reservations and had to change them several times, the lady was really amazing and friendly in helping us do so.  Loved the bread and Italian salsa.  Lovely relaxed atmosphere.  For appetizers, we had clams (which we really good) but the family style anti-pasta platter was absolutely the favorite thing I had all night.  Very reminiscent of the scene from \"My 100 Foot Journey\" where they are indulging in a platter of amazing delicacies.  Just an amazing array of tastes and textures.  Only thing I would add would be a refill of the bread or crostini.  Wedding soup was solid.  Ferrenti wine, was really nice, not over the top sweet,  if I were to be picky I would say I prefer it to be a little colder.  For my entree, I had the lobster risotto.   Very smooth and creamy, nice large chunks of lobster.  This place was very kid friendly but also just friendly in general.  Would certainly return."}
{"text":"I have been going to Mario's my whole life!!! Everyone that knows me knows if you ask me to pick where we are going to go out to eat I am picking Mario's hands down. There is nothing about this place that isn't SPETACULAR!! The food is so fresh, delicious, and the presentation is gorgeous. You cannot find a more hospitable restaurant anywhere! Lisa the owner, whenever she is there which is pretty much everyday, will always go around to every table and see how everyone is doing and thank them for coming in. I have had many of my birthday celebrations there and every time I bring someone who has never been there they are amazed at how good everything is and why they haven't been here before. If I could recommend anything specific I would say the tomato-alfredo sauce with any pasta you get. This sauce is so unique and tasty that I can't get enough of it. All I ask is that you go and try this amazing place you WILL NOT be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Have never been here before, what a mistake. This place is a true gem. The food was fantastic, and the service impeccable.  We will be back and often."}
{"text":"This is my families \"get together\" go to restaurant.  Great food, knowledgeable, friendly service paired with.classic Italian favorites like Nona used to make. They treat everyone like a personal family friend here. The Lemon Chicken is like butter, smooth, melt in your mouth goodness. Risotto, the true measure of any Italian place for me, is equally heavenly.  Great location, easy to get to from West or East. Make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Had a team lunch for work here recently and I was impressed by the overall mom and pop feel of this place.  Our server was very accommodating and made everyone feel like we were at a family dinner.  I really liked the fresh bread brought out at the beginning of our meal and how attentive all of the staff was to clear plates and refill glasses.  I chose the Roma Sub as my lunch option and it included a pizza sauce, ham, salami, pepperoni, and provolone cheese served with a side of cavatelli pasta in a red sauce.  I was impressed at the portion size and originality of the dish.  My co-workers from the area all raved about this place so I'm glad I got to experience it for myself."}
{"text":"First of all it's important to note that if you're looking for legit authentic Italian food you won't get it here.  But if you're looking for just decent food this place will do.  I came here with a couple coworkers for a business dinner. We made a reservation but it was a Monday night so the place wasn't too crowded. I hear it's quite busy on weekends so a reservation might be a good idea.  Inside its pretty nice if pretty basic.  The menu has a lot of selections to choose from so there should be something for everyone.  I tried the lemon chicken which I honestly wasn't excited about when I ordered it but when I actually ate it it was actually pretty good. I would likely order it again.  The portions are pretty generous and many entrees come with a salad.  We didn't really want dessert but they gave us each a slice of what I can only describe as wedding cake. It was ok and worth the price of free.  Service was good though as I said it wasn't very busy that evening. Prices aren't cheap but not bad for what you get.  Overall I would likely return if I were in the area again."}
{"text":"I first heard about this place while I was on vacation walking my hyena on the Atlantic shore. After I came back from vacation, I decided to give it a chance after hearing good things about it. I went in the restaurant and sat down and ordered some pasta. I also ordered some ice water. It was the best ice water I ever had. The ice was frozen, which was nice. I really recommend the water for anyone who enjoys water. When my pasta was ready, I ate it. I wasn't very happy with the way they put the cheese on it so I took out the parmesan I had in my pocket from the night before and sprinkled it on. That made it super good and I did get a piece of lint stuck in my teeth from my pocket, but that's ok. This place was pretty coo.  -Bobby Bob"}
{"text":"My Cousin Tim recommended this place for my Mom's Memorial Luncheon  Everything we had was Awesome !  This is The Place to go !!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner yesterday with a party of 6 at Mario Fazio's.    I'm just plain stupid for not visiting this great establishment more often.    Everything was great... from being greated warmly, to outstanding and attentive service (Ashley), and wow to the outstanding meals.  The chicken parmesan with peppers and sausage special was lights out, my wife's gluten free pizza was raved by everyone, and my son's main course salad was bountiful and delicious.  Our friends that joined us also loved their first visit to Mario Fazio's.  I promise to not be stupid and return shortly!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for a family, group of friends, or just to pick up some grub to go.  I've got 3 or 4 things on the menu in the last 5 months and each time the order was accurate and delicious.  I usually just grab and go but the inside is very comforting and I think that anyone that goes there will have at least a 3 star experience.  I probably wouldn't drive out of my way but if you are close and on the fence, jump over and grab some really good Italian food."}
{"text":"Arrived in town and could not check into hotel. Looked on Yelp for a restaurant and saw all the favorable reviews so we tried it out. Service was outstanding!!! At least 4 people asked if were enjoying our meal. Everybody was so outgoing and friendly. Braciole was also outstanding and my wife enjoyed her primavera with chicken.  Great atmosphere for a nice dinner!  Definitely worth going."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I have eaten at in a very long time. Starting with an excellent waitress and staff. The kind of service that though I left little over 20%, I still feel  like I should have left more as I am writing this.  The food was great from warm garlic, to the beautifully prepared side salad and there original Sammy's Pasta with Sunday Sauce.   Marinara sauce made with meat from slow cooked ribs and two meat balls. I apologize ahead a of time, for going home and stealing this idea."}
{"text":"Serendipity strikes again! On our 31st wedding anniversary While driving from Madison Ohio in the general direction of Willoughby Hills and a goal of Italian food for lunch it was decided that we go to Mario Fazio's which is in a new location since the last time we had dined there at least 25 years ago. The food, ambience, service and value was exceptional! To top it off as we were leaving the owner wished us a happy anniversary and asked if it was our first time here and handed us a box filled with Mario Fazio's goodies! Thank you for a wonderful anniversary lunch experience. It won't take 25 years for us to return!!!"}
{"text":"From the moment you walk through the doors of Mario Fazio's, there is an overarching feeling of family. We were greeted as soon our feet crossed the threshold and immediately whisked over to our table. You can instinctively feel the family atmosphere, which is intensified by the waitress referring to the entire table as \"family.\"   This family-style restaurant is one of a dying breed. Dinner is slow, like it should be. The staff gives you the time to kibbutz with your loved ones as you sip on their delicious house white, a sweet Italian pinot grigio. There is italian bread and chatting before the waitress even takes the appetizer order.   The calamari appetizer was cooked perfectly and the portion size was just right for the whole table to share. As we began eating our appetizers and salads, it became apparent that this is the place where people come to feel at home. It was clear that the majority of the people in the restaurant had been long time regulars. The staff asked about their families and how work was going, something you simply cannot get at many restaurants anymore.   The main courses came -- and like all proper Italians -- we occasionally took bites as we talked. The salmon atop lentils was cooked very well, but it was the Beef Braciole that really stole the show. Just as we all sat back and decided that there was no more room to stuff, dessert was served. A traditional strawberry cassata cake accompanied with espresso and coffee was just the right way to end the meal.   Our meal lasted for hours, but felt like just moments and the staff was gracious and patient. If you're looking for a relaxed evening that moves on it's own like you're sitting at your own mother's dinner table, Mario Fazio's is just that; and although the food here won't be found on the Upper East Side of New York City, it is the kind of food that you can imagine being made for you by someones Italian mother: filling, delicious and full of love."}
{"text":"The service here is excellent. A mix of fresh faces and regular customers. The food is fantastic and didn't take long to come out on a very busy Saturday night. This place sort of symbolizes everything that is holy and sacred about an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Eating at Mario Fazio's is like eating in an old Italian grandma's kitchen. This is Italian home cooking at its best. The food is amazing and the service is even better. Not the kind of service you'd want for a fast meal, but the kind that will make you feel at home for an hour or more. They poured us complimentary wine while we waited off our table, gave my toddler a snack as soon as we sat down, took him to pick out his ice cream at the end of his meal while we finished our food and brought us free cassata cake at the end. I have never been to a restaurant that was this kid friendly. It is obviously run by parents. Our party had four very different entrees: salmon, beef braciole, clams, and lemon chicken. All were perfect. The wedding soup to start is some of the best I've had. We will be back. Again and again."}
{"text":"The thing I liked the most was the service! Everyone there was always so friendly and nice. They don't come to you every two minutes to check on you like a normal restaurant. They give you time to eat. The food is pretty good, I like the appetizers the most. After your done eating you get a little bit of free dessert (I won't tell what though, that will ruin it). Overall, great experience I totally recommend it, especially if you love Italian food like me!"}
{"text":"Excellent find. The food and the atmosphere were amazing. It was nice that the owner was on site and personally checked in with you."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our road trip and we are extremely glad we did. This is a true Italian family restaurant. The manager was very friendly and service was incredible from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. The cavatelli lunch special had an incredible flavor. If you are ever in the area, you must stop by!"}
{"text":"After relocating to this area from Los Angeles, I am happy to see that marios  is still here and still producing great food. Really well priced and Lisa is super friendly!  We used to get pizza here when we were kids and as an adult, still enjoy the pizza."}
{"text":"My family had an early dinner here after a baptism. All the food was amazing and the owner and staff were so accomodating. We chose certain dishes ahead of time and everything was served \"family style\" to our large group. No complaints and only compliments from everyone involved. I would recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys great Italian food."}
{"text":"Very good service and very good pizza.  I would definitely recommend this place if you like Italian food. Authentic Italian."}
{"text":"The food is good and the staff always goes above and beyond. Went here on a Thursday night with 12 family members, and my baby, to celebrate my grandmother's 85th birthday. First of all, the place was packed. We weren't even the largest party there, but you'd never know they were so busy. Service was superb and friendly as ever.  Two things that really gave them the 5 stars this visit were the attention to the baby and the special touch at the end of the meal. An employee brought out peas, applesauce and crayons for the baby at the beginning, which was great to keep her occupied while everyone chatted and ordered. Each meal normally comes with a \"taster\" piece of cassata cake. Since the waitstaff knew we were celebrating a birthday, each piece of cake was topped with ice cream and a star-shaped cookie. This was a pleasant surprise.   As for the food, I still love the bread and Italian salsa. If you're ever there when the special is a pasta with \"Sunday sauce,\" get it (unless you're a vegetarian). The Sunday sauce is a slightly spicy red sauce simmered with short ribs and meatballs over a cavatelli pasta. It is amazing!"}
{"text":"Okay so this is my second review on this place.  My mother in law took us here for dinner for my birthday.  I have to say that the meal was much better.  I noticed that they serve half the portion of bread and dip than the first time we were there several years ago.  Guess the economy is affecting everyone but I think this practice is a better way to go to avoid waste.  They do refill once we ran out though.  Their Italian salsa dip is as good as ever!  I even bought a couple of jars to bring home.  For dinner I ordered the menu special which was lobster on macaroni with cheese, it was really tasty.  They still serve a complimentary sliver of white cake for dessert, which for me was a perfect size just for a little sweetness and not filling me over the top.    Just as the first visit here, Lisa was noticeably present, helping serve and saying hello to many regulars.  This place was packed with people waiting to be seated!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to visiting.  Maybe a glass of good vino to go along with homemade Italian fare.  Sounds good.  Went there for a birthday, as this is my GF's favorite place.  I made reservations,(was told either 4:00 or 8:30) although there is no hostess or reservation book so I was kind of confused as to how they manage reservations upon entering.    No bar, or wine list (you better like the one they have which is a $7.99 retail bottle) , no refills on wine or water for that matter. The garlic bread and sweet salsa was a disgusting combination.  Waitress Kim never followed up with us after we got our food, or to check in with us the entire night so savor each drop of that water.    Chicken Marsala was average, but my Beef Braciole had the flavor profile of a Cotton Ball.  Totally dry with some rubbery noodles.  Terrible.  When they came to clear the table, they were surprised (borderline insulted) that I did not want to take it home, but still never asked \"was everything OK\"?    I guess for the price ($15-17 entree) you shouldn't expect much, but the reviews had me hoping for much more.  I would only give this place one star, but my GF likes the place.  Don't plan on getting any more of my money Mario."}
