{"text":"The best place in town for this type of menu. Same food you can get a few other places, but with just enough of a twist to make it something more. Prices are fair, and the portions are excellent."}
{"text":"update your operating hours !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
charged money with wrong operate hour from this restaurant. with no reason, have to wait other business days to get refund. 
~inconvenient service~"}
{"text":"We were quite disappointed by our order here. Our order was incorrect when it arrived.  We did not receive the bread and cole slaw advertised as part of the meal and the grilled chicken sandwich came as a fried chicken sandwich. The chicken tenders also had a slightly spoiled tasted to them. The beef sandwich that we ordered was not bad, but overall we were highly dissatisfied. We will not be ordering here again."}
{"text":"We were attracted by the gyro advert on the side of the shop. We mentioned wanting Mediterranean food and it appeared for us. 
The proprietor was running the whole place. He took a moment to get to us, but because he was obviously finishing making others food. He makes sure all of the food is fresh. 
Between the gyro and the fish sandwich, and our piles of fries, my friend and I were totally satisfied with our food.
The place was clean. The proprietor obviously takes pride in his work. Highly recommend. Will return if in Champaign again."}
{"text":"Food quantity is good and well...tasty! I think this place is closed, I've gone there twice at different times and no one there but there are no signs..."}
{"text":"The family and I decided to try this place and had it delivered through Eat24. Delivery took way longer than it should have. According to the app it was supposed to be delivered by 7:55, we didn't get it until almost 9 with no real explanation.
As for the food: we were ordering for 5 people, it cost about $50 and everyone got full. So good bang for the buck. We ordered a variety of things:
Italian Beef: pretty good, lots of meat but it's no Portillos.
Gyro: very full, got good reviews from the picky teen. 
Hot dog: little one was happy but said other area restaurants have better (and she should know, it's pretty much all she'll order at any given place).
Double fish sandwich: hubby was happy with how big it was, taste was great. 
Onion rings: nothing special, talking Ore Ida, grocery store rings. Pretty disappointing. 
Fried mushrooms: not bad, not the best. They were overdone.
Fries: super run of the mill. 
Coleslaw: excellent, great tang to the dressing. 
Would order from again to try new things."}
{"text":"If there was a rating beneath one star, I'd give it. I ordered crab legs from this restaurant through a delivery app and 2 hours later and 45 minutes past the delivery window THEY provided, they canceled my order with no explanation AFTER updating the delivery window. This isn't the first time I had extremely bad service from this restaurant, but it most certainly is the last time. Horrible."}
{"text":"Great food good price. I really enjoy the hot wings and mozzarella sticks.  50 got wings for 25.99 how can you beat that."}
{"text":"Very bad service, the cashier was playing game instead of tending for the counter while i was there. A good 1 minute stand without being greeted. Ordered fish and fries for Lent that came out pretty decent. Ended up paying more than $10s before realizing that the cashier offered me the same kind of fish but different cuts, which increased the price and he did not even explain it prior to ordering. Overall its an okay place, got to know this place from word-of-mouth."}
{"text":"On EatStreet, this restaurant is called also called Tasty Mediterranean. I ordered for delivery and received a call over an hour later with no one on the line. I then got a text from that number (not EatStreet) saying that my order was canceled. When I called it, I got no response. When I called the restaurant, they explained that my order was canceled because they couldn't contact me, and also were out of hummus (one of the things I ordered). They didn't seem to have an explanation for why they were just then contacting me (after my order was estimated to be delivered), or why my whole order needed to be canceled because they didn't have one item. Then they asked me to call EatStreet myself to get the order canceled. Woof."}
