{"text":"A date night must! Everything from the appetizers to dessert is incredible; the cozy and intimate location with a view of the capitol is unbeatable. It is a bit small inside so I would not recommend for a group with five or more."}
{"text":"Small menu, great chef. Really enjoyed our first experience here. Chef Rob is really uping his game and creativity! I know the next time we eat here there will be a good wait for amazing food!"}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night and it was excellent.  I had the lobster bisque and it was to die for! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt and wonder if I went on an \"off night.\"

My smoked bbq pork shoulder was a serenade of heavy handed sugar and salt, I almost struggled to finish it. There was absolutely no nuance to the bbq sauce, no acidity to balance the maple nor spice to be discerned. The grits suffered from too much cheese, even in Wisconsin that is hard to accomplish. The highlight of my dish were the collard greens which were well seasoned, flavorful and left with enough texture for a pleasing bite.

Other diners in our party had issues as well: there were plenty of bones left in the white fish, a lack of preparation unbecoming of the level of place Hamilton sets itself up for in price. All of this coupled with the somewhat cold service, I have to disagree with most other Yelper's and say go to other places on the Square."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The menu is both innovative and familiar at the same time. The food is local, fresh, and delicious and the staff are very friendly and welcoming. There is a really fun cocktail list to top it all off! We went for lunch and based on that I can highly recommend the BLT and the Pork Shoulder sandwiches. It was all surprisingly affordable too, especially considering the location and quality of the food. We will definitely be going back  for dinner and also to check out their late night happy hour. Bacon on a stick?! Count me in!"}
{"text":"Another small plates restaurant in the old Blue Marlin space. Went on a Thursday.  Two other diners and three at the bar.  Service was attentive and excellent.  Decor is brightened up and tasteful.  The bar itself looks great.  Menu is limited, but quite good--one of us had the halibut, which was esp. tasty, and the beef tartare had crunchy bits of bread mixed in.  Drinks and wine thumbs up.  It's just a little pricey for what you get, but  you're probably paying for the intimacy and smaller size of the place.  If you want privacy or a more intimate setting than Cento or Graft, this is the place.  If I lived on that side of the square I'd be in there once a week for drinks."}
{"text":"To die for!! The lobster bisque will bring you to your knees. Stellar service. I'm digging the ambience."}
{"text":"Just opened on 8/4.  The decor is fun.  They give you cucumber water which is delicious.  I ordered a Peter Rabbit, a Pimms cup plus basil and a pickle carrot.  The carrot was really tasty.

For dinner we started with the beef tartar it was okay but a little too strong in flavor.  The sweet corn with brown butter was fresh and light.  For large plates we ordered the octopus.  My husband thought it was cooked perfectly. I couldn't bring myself to eat something with tentacles.  The duck had a cherry sauce.  The duck was not quite as tender as I had hoped but still had good flavor.  

The service was quite good and the waitress was attentive and fun.  I think Hamilton's has great potential and I am looking forward to trying it again."}
{"text":"I went to Hamilton's last weekend with some friends. Beautiful atmosphere. Everyone agreed the meat entrees were delicious.  Really, I think some of the best in Madison.  The appetizers were ok. The desserts were wonderful as well.    However my only gripe was the service was not what I expected.  We went there for a special dinner, to enjoy a leisurely dinner with friends.   However, we got the feeling the waitress wanted to turn over her table as soon as possible.  For the amount of money they charge for their food, I expect to enjoy my time there.  It will be some time before trying it again.  :("}
{"text":"We walked in with a large table of 7 on a Monday night and were treated to a marvelous meal. I had the filet mignonette with Bokchoy and mushrooms. Wonderful!  Great flavor and very tender. Waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly. Everyone loved their meal!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night a party of eight...For appetizers we had the board with three different cheeses, pickled beans, nuts and a rillette but came with 7 pieces of bread for 8 people..not very impressive..also the beef tartare which came with three pieces of bread (tartare was awesome)...Two had the smoked pork shoulder, my husband like his, I tasted it thought it was very dry, one had sirloin, two had the lamb which I tasted and was good, I had the special of the night which was the halibut with a succotash on bottom, very good but could  of ate double the serving, maybe a potato to go with the entrees...another person had the gnudi, good, but not much there either...And the final entree was a special of the night a vegetable gratin of some sort with fennel and maybe onions, not vegetarian because it had duck sauce, it came out in a very, very small dish, think creme brulee dish....for a entree, I don't think so, maybe good for a vegetable side dish, but not a main dish, let alone a special of the night. Service was very good, water refilled constantly, drinks came fast, but our server didn't know too much about the specials, had to read her notes and she said she never tasted them so couldn't offer a comment, but she was very pleasant and polite. Don't know if we will be back. The person who had the gratin went away hungry..."}
{"text":"Stopped in a couple of weeks ago as we were on a little restaurant app/drink crawl. I had no idea Blue Marlin closed and there was a new spot on the square. I suggest more signage or some marketing because we nearly missed it and walked right by, and nobody still seems to be aware a great place opened up!

The signature cocktail that the bartender made us was delightful and the small plates we ordered were fantastic. Everything was well-prices. Staff was friendly. The place has a very \"cool\" but still intimate and cozy feel. 

Love the redesign- elegant and on trend but understated. A good place for a date or or small group dinner, or a cocktail (or two... or more)."}
{"text":"The food never fails to amaze me here and the staff is so friendly. Do yourself a favor and ask the bartender to whip you up something with **insert your favorite liquor here** and they will make you something incredible."}
{"text":"Given that there are so few restaurants open late in Madison Hamilton's gets two stars for that. The food and the service however, leave a lot to be desired. Plates arrived cold with tepid food and a shrimp and grits entree had five tiny shrimp. Too bad since it has a warm, inviting decor. Definitely not up to the standard set by Blue Marlin in the same location for so many years."}
{"text":"There is a lot of dining options on and around the square so I thought I would try this place because it's about a year old now.

The place has a few outside tables by the front door if you want to sit outside but it was raining when I was there. The place is very charming with exposed brick walls and cool light fixtures. There is a nice bar on the left as you walk in with comfy booths and tables. One couple was at the bar when we walked in which was odd since it looks like a nice place.

There is enough on the limited lunch menu to satisfy most people. There is a nice cocktail/drink menu that would complement your meal or just sit at the bar. My meal choice would be the duck confit which is basically a duck French dip.

The service was ok but the bar tender was also the only server for the front so when the place completely filled up we didn't see much of him, just in passing. I didn't like how he put the check on the table while I was still eating and we might have had another drink or desert, I think it was a message to clear the table and one less for him to try and take care of. I thought the food took slightly long for how empty the place was and that we ordered sandwiches.

The duck confit looked amazing and I had the potatoes as my side. The sandwich was pulled duck, smoked provolone, caramelized onions on a baguette with a duck broth for dipping. My sandwich was obviously made first because the melted cheese was not melty and frozen in place.

The side of potatoes were very good because they were skin on and roasted with garlic which made for good texture and flavor. The duck confit was really good because it was tender and juicy with a great balance from the very good fresh/chewy baguette, the perfect bread for the sandwich. The duck broth for dipping just complemented the sandwich well and the whole plate worked well.

Over all I was a little disappointed that my sandwich sat so long that my melty cheese turned solid again. I also felt that the menu and image that this place is trying to put out fell short with the cheap paper napkins, this is a nice place so put a cloth napkin on the table when I spend $80 for lunch. We all liked the food so I would recommend going over and check them out. I would definitely go back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I have not dined out for New Year in a very long time. We chose Hamilton's for an intimate early dinner. Knowing later would be crowed. It was nice. There were only 4 other couples and a few people at the bar. The \"New Years Menu\"  for $95 was a surprise. Not mentioned when reservations made. 
The service was outstanding. 
Food good not great. The price was outrageous considering the bite size portions. 
 Where they failed.....once the bill was paid we were asked to finish our wine at the bar! We questioned why...We needed to prepare for the next seating!!! The tables were empty and maybe 15 people at the bar! 
I was in food serve for many years, I dine out 3-4 times a week......NEVER been asked to move to the bar!!!!! Not the best experience! 
Deal Breaker"}
{"text":"I have been to Hamilton's several times now for cocktails and sometimes dessert with friends. We often make it our last stop after a night out downtown as we all head back to our respective places on the East Side. The last time I went there, I had a juniper cocktail (literally tastes like juniper berries) and apple cake with house-made cinnamon ice cream. My friends had the pumpkin cheesecake with roasted pecans. When my friend couldn't decide on a drink from their menu, the bartender made a bright pink off menu cocktail that was delicious. The server said they had come up with it in-house during a slow night.

Overall, great location, food, alcohol selection, decor, and background music. Super fresh ingredients and lots of house-made stuff. This is definitely a foodie restaurant: portions are small, ingredients are fresh, and attention to detail is high.

The staff are very attentive and genuine, and conversations with them have left me with the impression that they really care about Madison and fostering a vibrant local restaurant scene here. Hamilton's opened recently, and I often see it relatively empty. I wish more people would frequent Hamilton's cuz I think it's a neat--if pricey--little place, but at the same time, I kind of like getting the personalized attention that comes with being one of only a handful of groups there at a time. Stop in and give it a go!"}
{"text":"Looking online I was not overly impressed with the menu. But it's new and we thought we would give it a try. 
Nice. 
Friendly, friendly, friendly.  Tim the bartender was great. Go Hodags. Clay the server is incredibly knowledgable about the menu. Both are hugely helpful when ordering.  
We had a great vegetarian starter with three complimentary cheese selections and some nice house made pickled veggies. 
The grid cauliflower was light, and we found ourselves dipping some great baguette bread slices in the sauce. (And they were great about offering more bread.). 
Gnudi was outstanding as well, although it was more like a hushpuppy, but the sauce and the balance were spot on. 
Cocktails were good, but could use a few more liquor selections.  
Wine list was diverse and had a good selection for every price point - perfect. 
Welcome to Madison. Good luck.  :-)


Checking back in. Did not realize until today they were open for lunch. Very, very good. Duck confit sandwich might be best sandwich around the Capitol. Pulled duck, plenty of meat, not greasy, and excellent au jus for dunking that adds a bit of tangyness. Still great service. Will be a regular for lunch now. Well done!!!"}
{"text":"Hamilton's is a nice addition to this side of the square, replacing the blue marlin..

They didn't change the decor much, it's still dimly lit and relaxing. You can also sit outside when it's still nice out...

Moving on to the foods. They are also trying to do a small/big plate thing where you can order several small dishes and a big one to share, or well, however you like.

Their portions are nice and very reasonably priced. Very interesting choice of ingredients.. We tried the chanterelle mushrooms, grilled octopus and duck breast. Decent food and good selection of cocktails... If they switch up their menu every now and then, I will definitely become a regular! (Well, in a reasonable time frame)"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on a Wednesday night. I was hoping to order off their late night menu, but I arrived a bit too early (late night is served 11 pm-1 am). I had a long day at work and was looking forward to treating myself. I started off with the Peter Rabbit cocktail. The pickled carrots are a creative garnish, and the basil with lemon was refreshing. The bartender suggested I should start off with a cup of the shrimp and andouille gumbo. Gumbo is something new to me, and I'm glad I tried it! It started off with a mild kick, which got spicier with each bite. You gotta love andouille sausage! I ordered the Grilled Sea Trout, and was blown away. The simplicity that this dish offered was admirable, yet the depth of flavor was profound. The sea trout was served over a bed of perfectly cooked spaghetti squash and braised kale. It was a light dish that left me more than satisfied. The food I had ordered so far, at this point, led me to order TWO desserts (I was treating myself after all). I tried their ice cream flavor of the day which was a creamy coconut and lemongrass combo. Heavenly and rich. I also ordered the cheesecake with apricots. This wasn't as sweet and had more of a tangy/sour note. I'm glad I chose this place as my treat. I was impressed with all the food I ordered. Everything from presentation, flavor, and execution. I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant here on yelp and it certainly was everything that the hype said it would be. The lunch sandwiches were delicious, but my favorite part was the vanilla bourbon cheesecake! Our server, Josh, was really cool too!"}
{"text":"Pros: cute atmosphere, plays great music

Aside from that the food was okay. We ordered the cheese plate, which we didn't love. There was nothing special about it. They did have an octopus on the menu that was very good though! I also ordered an old fashioned there that came out way too sweet and sour. I did get a drink with basil and gin--can't remember the name, but it was on their menu and that came out amazing. Overall, mixed feelings about this place. They have a couple of good items on the menu, but they can definitely improve!"}
{"text":"I looked at the menu online before I came here, and was unsure if there was really going to be anything I liked. HOWEVER, I loved pretty much everything on the menu - we ended up trying a bunch of plates and sharing. I don't eat red meat, I just don't like it, but one of my favorite dishes here was the sirloin and now I consistently order red meat only at Hamilton's. The pasta is great too! I am never let down by the food here and continue to come back. A great spot for downtown lunch or a nice dinner. Whenever someone is visiting Madison and wants a good meal that is a little bit more upscale, this is the place to take them! Or just to treat yourself :) Also wheelchair accessible through the side door!"}
{"text":"I had the most delicious Cuban sandwich in all the land last night at Hamilton's! If you love the pork shoulder dish then you most definitely will love the Cuban. 
The sandwich held well together with all the amazing flavours. I could of had ten of these Cubans in one sitting! I highly recommend this sandwich off of their Lunch or Late Night Menu!
Thanks Josh and Adam for the recommendation and making my tummy sing in joy! It truly was a labour of love! I wish I took a picture but I ate it all :)
Très bien!!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday for lunch and I was really impressed with everything. The atmosphere was cozy, rustic and romantic.

I had the Smoked Pork Shoulder sandwich and it was gorgeous. The apple-cabbage slaw topped with arugula was a perfect compliment to the pork along with and the amazing bread it was served on. I had a side of greens that came dressed and if I would change anything, I would have preferred to add the dressing myself (that's my own little issue). Otherwise everything thing was spot on and I cannot wait to go back and try the duck. 

As for a drink, I would recommend The Jean Luc Colombo Rose. 

I parked on the street in one hour parking and ended up staying for three hours, the $25 parking ticket was totally worth it. 

The owner was there working and he was very engaging in all aspects including serving food. My waitress/bartender was super friendly and sweet as well."}
{"text":"Nice place, great service.  I had the ricotta gnudi as an appetizer. It was huge and could have been my meal, not complaining though as I really liked it. The pumpkin broth was a bit over seasoned with salt. My entree which I maybe ate half of was the short ribs, again over seasoned. Plus there was a bit too much fat on the meat.  They had a lot of good sounding food and if they had the seasoning right it would be great. Decent value."}
{"text":"Our previous dining experiences at Hamiltons were wonderful. Food, service, and drinks were great. Our most recent experience was very different: I think this was our worst Madison dining experience in 5 years. The tuna carpaccio was bland, tenderloin stroganoff tasted terrible, and smoked pork shoulder also tasted off. The grilled bread, tenderloin, stroganoff pasta, and pork all tasted exactly the same- burnt and like old charcoal. I'm not sure what happened, maybe the grill was dirty, but the food was terrible."}
{"text":"Daaaaannnggg this place is great. The bf and I wandered in Friday night after attending MMoCA nights (courtesy of Yelp! Thanks Yelp!). We were strolling around the square feeling a little uninspired over the usual places. Hamilton's caught my attention out of the corner of my eye-the exposed stone and cool lanterns over the bar made me think \"this is a place I want to sit inside of.\" We walked over and saw a few open tables and assumed there would be a wait-those open tables must be for reservations, we figured. Nope, we were seated right away and were able to score a table at the window. The one seat had a gorgeous view of the Capitol. 

I was surprised to see the poor reviews regarding service. Both the host and our server were extremely friendly and prompt. Our server was one of the best and most friendly I've had in awhile. We ordered drinks rather quickly-very nice list of cocktails with a few unusual selections-and our server came back a few minutes later to let us know there would be a small wait because a bunch of people had just sat down at the bar. No problem and thanks for letting us know!

The drinks were great. I had the rum sour which was delightfully refreshing. One of those drinks that tastes like vacation in a glass. The bf had the Manhattan which was quite strong but enjoyable. For dinner I had the ricotta gnudi. And wow, just wow. The gnudi were outstanding and the broth was perfect-not an overwhelming squash flavor at all. The broth was so delicious I would have licked the bowl clean if this was socially acceptable. Alas, it is not. Luckily this dish is served with a spoon so I was able to scrape up as much as possible. 

I'm new to Madison but those who aren't would know Hamilton's is in the previous space which was the Blue Marlin. In a nod to the past occupant, the special Saturday night was a shrimp diablo. My dining companion had that and wow, it was also excellent. Five decent sized shrimp along with some crazy delicious sausage crumbles in a cream Sriracha sauce with penne. Yum yum yum. It was exceptional. We were both pleasantly surprised at how amazing our food was. We will be back for sure.

The space is really more of a 4 star space and the food really outshines the ambiance. I loved the exposed stone walls and lanterns (it reminded me a little of Chicago's Violet Hour) but the other wall is a little odd and the music doesn't seem to quite go with the feel of the place. It wasn't loud at all as other reviewers have written."}
{"text":"'Twas a few nights before Christmas, we walked through the square,
when our stomachs were rumbling and needed some care.

We had plans for dinner, just needed a snack,
Perhaps some libations, I never oppose to that.

Then what to our wondering eyes should appear, 
but a lovely little shop filled with cheeses & beer.

We shared a cheese board filled with dairy & meats,
I'm not going to lie, we were digging these eats.

Service wasn't amazing, but it got the job done,
And it sure did not have, any effect on our fun.

Drinks were strong, I recommend the Hot Apple Cider,
No doubt this warm beverage made me a bit wider.

And then just like that, it was time for us to be on our way,
We left slightly more tipsy to move on with our day. 

We proclaimed to the world as we walked out of sight,
\"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!\""}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed with this place. It's smaller than I thought it would be and it was loud. The food as subpar, especially for the price. We ordered the roasted carrot appetizer to start with. This dish should be renamed kale salad with one roasted carrot cut into sections. For entrees, I had the oven roasted halibut and my husband had the lamb chops. The top of my halibut was so salty, I had to scrape it off just to eat the small piece of fish. My husband's lamb was also overly salty around the outside. The only good thing I have to say about the place was that our waitress was pleasant."}
{"text":"Service was abysmal from hostess to bar to wait staff. 
We called early in the day and told that we'd have no problem getting a table. Get there and told it will be less than 20 minutes. That's fine. We will grab a drink at the bar. 20 minutes later I ask the bartender for a status on the table. He ignores the request / mishears me and closes my tab instead. Another 15 minutes goes by and we finally get our table. The host laughs \"sorry it took a little longer.\" that's it. 
Order appetizer right away. Waitress returns to our table to take our order. Says the special. We ask a question of the menu, she answers then walks way without taking our order. 10 minutes goes by before she returns. What the hell? Service was slow all night but that was ridiculous. 
Food we ordered ended up being good, which was the only positive. Some of the other entrees being delivered were tiny portioned, smaller than the small plates, especially the steak and crab cake entrees. They would have been way overpriced at an already expensive place."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The staff are super friendly and attentive, and very knowledgeable on drinks, etc.

We only had an appetizer and drinks while we were there, but it was excellent (some kind of lovely mushroom thingie--fantastic!).

I'm looking forward to going back for a full meal."}
{"text":"The worst steak tacos I have ever had.  Really.  Completely void of any flavor.  Nada.  They substituted ingredients from the menu description and that didn't help. Cilantro was replaced with lettuce.  There was no onion. The meat was good quality but was not seasoned at all,  I think it was a single slice of NY strip on each taco (3).  At $25 I recommend avoiding this dish.  I wouldn't have been happy paying half that."}
{"text":"Food: 3
Service: 2
Uniqueness: 4

-------------------------------------------
Dude, can you do Math? (3+2+4) / 3 = 3. Why are you giving it a 2?

It's because this place is EXPENSIVE! Especially for Madison!

The menu definitely had some uniqueness but the execution was mediocre at best. We missed out on the Gumbo as they had run out but the carpaccio was two itty bitty slices of salmon for 18 dollars!

The service was pretty poor as well. We got all of one drink order taken but it's ok they didn't ask if we wanted others because the drinks we got tasted like rubbing alcohol. 

We did go on a busy Friday night so that may have contributed to the negative experience. Unfortunately the high price will keep me away from giving them a second shot. :("}
{"text":"Small plates on the square--with potential.

We arrived on the official opening day, and it showed, as staff were a bit confused about staff roles (\"Who's seating the guests?\") and a modest delay in receiving our orders.  The snafus were tempered by the clear enthusiasm and pride from the staff in opening day, so I expect  these issues will resolve quickly.

Both the beverage menu and the food menu had a small selection of choices. Strong emphasis on local purveyors, although the menu itself didn't make this clear. 

Ricotta gnudi with fried lacinato kale: we enjoyed the pillowy ricotta dumplings with of crunchy kale leaves and cheese shavings .

Charred sweet corn clusters with chanterelle mushroom and savory brown butter topping--mushrooms added umami to the sweet corn, which was a great choice to enjoy a seasonal vegetable, and the topping (brown butter powder?) added additional texture, but not much taste.  An additional savory sauce to the sauce already included would have made it even better.

For drinks, the Peter Rabbit (with Pimm's of course!) arrived with a carrot garnish. The drinks arrived a little later than I would expect, but again, I think this is a first day of service thing.  The cocktail was nicely balanced and mixed with fresh ingredients. Until writing this, I didn't make the connection between carrot and rabbit. 


The restaurant interior is very cozy and intimate, especially with the exposed stone walls and the building is a historical landmark (check the sign on the outside of the building). I'm confident that Hamilton's will smooth out any first day snafus and continue options inspired by local farmers and producers."}
{"text":"4 weeks post opening, Hamilton's struggled on a few fronts.  When we first walked in, the host stand was unattended and we had to wait for a waitress to seat us.  When the host did appear, he was wearing a buffalo plaid flannel and flip flops.  Not the best first impression.
The table we were seated at was missing one place setting and flatware that was only corrected after we requested it after our first course was delivered.  Service was slow overall.  Food, on the most past, suffered from a lack of seasoning.  When we requested salt for the beef tartare, we were told that another table also asked for salt and that the kitchen was too busy.  When we pressed, we were then told there is a disagreement between chef and owner regarding salt at the tables.  We pressed again and salt was finally delivered.
Hamilton's offers small plates as well as a few larger.  My girlfriend and I ordered:
The aforementioned beef tartare
Little Gem salad
Grilled Octopus
Duck Breast

Beyond the lack of seasoning, we thought the dishes were good but not great.  The beef tartare has small pieces of croutons mixed in but needed something with more crunch to be served along side of it.  The salad was on the verge of being overdressed.  We thought the grilled octopus was excellent, perfectly charred and tender.  However, I feel it didn't mesh well with the potato salad served alongside.  The duck was cooked to order (medium rare) but the shiitake puree was overpowered by the honey that was also listed on the menu.

Definitely a bumpy experience for us and will need to wait it out for awhile to see how other reviewers fare."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a friend 8/5/15, their second night open. Beef tartare appetizer was off the chain. Grilled octopus was perfectly done and the duck breast was excellent. St Bernardus on tap was an unexpected pleasure. And reasonable prices throughout were perhaps the biggest surprise. Eat here!"}
{"text":"Wonderful location and solid menu!

The menu may be short, but each item is well thought out. Everyone in the group I was with was very happy with their selections. No regrets for Hamilton's.

What I tried:
The Board- an assortment of delectable goodies. Super fun to share
Ricotta Gnudi- Being a veg, I love when a vegetarian entree is well executed. This one was definitely crafted with flavor and interest in mind. It was delicious and I want to swim in the aged gouda celeriac broth. Yum!
Flourless Chocolate Cake- Good, but a little standard. There were so many interesting things on the menu that this one felt a little lack luster
Candy Cap Panna Cotta- It's made with candy cap mushrooms, so had a very earthy flavor, but also very sweet and extremely creamy. I loved this one!

Definitely worth a return trip."}
{"text":"Food was great, as was the drink selection. I highly recommend the trout. Please add espresso and other after dinner drinks to your repertoire! Oddly non-existent!"}
{"text":"I came back for drinks and everything was excellent. Tasty, creative drinks and fabulous service! I want to try the food again but this most definitely will be a regular spot for cocktails."}
{"text":"We visited Hamilton's in early September as we were departing Wisconsin from a two week stay with family. It was the perfect way to wrap up our vacation. Our immediate family includes a then 11 month old. They accommodated her as well as me and my husband fabulously. We love the atmosphere - from the tunes to the decor. The cocktails were amazing as was the cheese platter. We took our time - moved onto a bottle of wine & a couple entrees - the octopus & the Gnudi both were delicious! We wished we had room for more.. oh wait, we also had a slice of dessert! (my parent of a infant brain does not remember everything - the plate was clean, very clean) The service was awesome, kind & prompt. This place is everything I love in a night out with my family!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Great food, good ambience, and the chef knows how to prepare ACTUAL MARYLAND CRABCAKES! Only place we've found them since leaving Baltimore."}
{"text":"Hey you...yeah you...I got a hot tip for you....

If you're looking for some of the best sandwiches in Madison, Hamilton's on the Square is where you need to plant your derriere.

Alright, that wasn't as dramatic as \"Blue Horseshoe Loves Anacott Steel\", but you get my drift.

I've made couple of lunchtime excursions to Hamilton's and left extremely impressed both times with the food, the venue and the service.  The only thing that shocks me was how empty the place was for its criminally underrated lunch service.

Given the small stature of the dining area, Hamilton's lunch time anonymity may be to my benefit.  When the weather prohibits the restaurant from utilizing its outside seating with a killer view of the Capitol Square, there's just room for about a couple dozen diners in the intimate dining area.  The interior of the restaurant features rustic stone behind the bar, abundant use of dark mahogany woodwork and understated geometric tiles.  The distressed metal light fixtures augment the cozy vibe of the interior.  Given all of the hard surfaces, it doesn't take much of a crowd for the noise level to escalate.  During my most recent visit, the clamor in the restaurant from a party of six made things a bit unnerving.  Expect difficulties conversing when a full house converges on Hamilton's. 

During both my visits, Josh, the owner of Hamilton's, was performing all of the front of house duties.  He always enthusiastically runs through all of the specials and provides tips on his favorite items on the regular menu.   Despite being a one-man show, service during my forays has been superlative: attentive, personable and prompt.

During my first visit, I ordered the $11 duck confit sandwich (caramelized onions, smoked provolone cheese, duck jus on a rustic baguette) and the quinoa salad.  Every component of my meal was spot on. It featured some of the best caramelized onions I've had in Madison, their sweetness paired masterfully with the slightly salty, umami-rich jus. The crusty fresh baguette provided texture and a surprising amount of flavor.  The delicate smokiness of the provolone played well with the perfectly cooked duck breast. It was easily one of the best sandwiches I've consumed during the past year.

During my second visit, I elected to go with the Cuban sandwich after Josh indicated the chef wanted to make this a signature dish on Hamilton's lunch menu.  The kitchen took a quality or quantity approach, which his appreciated in the era of super-sized lunch portions.  Again, the bread choice was spot on, which spent the perfect amount of time in the press to create a buttery-rich, crunchy exterior.  The deep roasted pork also was fantastic, fork tender and satisfyingly savory.  The pickle added wonderful crunch and brightness.  There were pockets of dryness - a more consistent application of mustard would easily remedy that problem.  Overall, I loved my sammie, it's the best Cuban I've had in Madison so far.  (If That BBQ Joint steps up its mustard game, it might be able to challenge for that title.)

The only beef I've had with my food at Hamilton's were with my roasted red potatoes.  While generally well-prepared and perfectly seasoned, several potatoes gave off an acrid, bitter aftertaste due to some rosemary that spent far too much time under the broiler.  Not cool, not cool.

Other random thoughts and musings:
* No Wi-Fi...ugh.
* I'm a fan of their jazz-laden background music playlist.
* Street parking downtown can be hit or miss.  It seems like the worse the weather, the more likely the only available parking spots will be on the far side of the Square.
* There are a surprising number of tempting dessert options, which always seems to be the case when you're dieting.  

Go to Hamilton's...now.  When it becomes crowded and über-popular, you can tell everyone you know that you were a regular long before it became the \"It\" lunchtime spot."}
{"text":"I went here a while ago. They had a great drink menu and we enjoyed the aesthetic of the bar. But I wan't impressed with the menu for their prices. Too expensive for what we got. Overall I wasn't impressed and I wish we would have went elsewhere."}
{"text":"The cocktail menu was delightful! We got the Caprese appetizer as a snack. it was delicious and I'm definitely looking forward to coming back for a full meal."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes over our estimated time. Wait staff awkwardly hovered while also not being speedy with taking orders nor delivering food. Most of the entrees came on small plates but were still over 25$. 

Overall not impressed."}
{"text":"Didn't eat here but the drinks were fantastic and fairly priced. Best old fashion I've had in Madison, which is saying something considering the Old Fashioned is right next door!"}
{"text":"I've gone in here several times and it was only crowded once. It's a very small tavern. The staff are exceptional and the manager/owner is cool too. Mood is jazzy but every type of person comes in from construction workers to business people. The food is great. Ask the bartenders to make you a drink they are very knowledgeable. They had a bacon special on Thursday that was awesome. They have a little patio during the summer that looks out onto the Capitol Building. Can't say a bad thing about it other than it is very small."}
{"text":"We had lunch here and were surprised we were the only diners! I guess the construction on the square doesn't help matters. If you have been thinking of trying this place, do it. First off Josh (the owner) could not have been friendlier, or more informative going over the entire menu with us. I had the Cuban which was the best Cuban I have ever tasted. The meat is so tender, and the bread is so yummy. My companion had the Duck Confit. We ended up sharing so we could taste each other's and her's was just as good as mine. The menu is small, but seems everything is done well. The space is beautiful, and I would love to return for dinner. Give it a try, you won't be sorry!"}
