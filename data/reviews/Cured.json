{"text":"Came on a weekday for lunch. Service was a little rough around the edges as the lady didn't seemed to either want to be there or knew what she was doing. We ordered the BELT and the schnitzel sandwich along with two mushroom soups. The mushroom soups were absolutely amazing and I would definitely go back for it! I did enjoy the BELT, but I found it quite messy because of all the sauce. The schnitzel unfortunately has some hairs in it and when we requested to have it remade the guy seemed quite unimpressed with us. It took us about 25 mins to get our sandwiches initially and then only 5 to get the schnitzel remade. Raised a lot of questions. We did end up buying some sausages to take home and BBQ and most of the ones we liked. I am on the fence about this place and might go back to try their weekend brunch. We will see."}
{"text":"New owners, new menu, even better than before. Organic eggs, grass-fed meats, no trans-fat in the baked pastry - healthy and tastes fabulous! Courteous staff, competitive prices. New name, Empire Provisions, a new location for some highly respected Calgary restaurant owners."}
{"text":"We popped in for a late lunch. I ordered the panini of the day, which was the tomato and six cheese blend. The tomato was hard and not very flavourful but the cheese was gooey and delicious. My daughter had a toasted rueben and she said it was terrific.

Their coffee prices look very fair and the atmosphere of the shop is clean and attractive. A real gem in this strip mall just south of Heritage."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I'm actually hesitant to even post this for fear that the place will become as popular as it deserves and the perk of not having to stand in line will no longer exist. However, I feel like it's my duty to share a glowing review when I've got one, and this happens to be one of those times. The service at this place is impeccable. The two people working were incredibly friendly and attentive. The brunch was delicious and the prices were awesome. I ordered the Bennie hills (eggs Benedict) which was $13, my husband ordered the cured skillet, which was also $13. Both were delicious. Our son got the chicken littles & chips for $5. While we waited, our son was able to play with a basket of toys that the restaurant had on hand and I browsed their awesome selection of deli meats while sipping a perfect Americano. Without a doubt, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This little gem gets a 4/5 as far as breakfast goes.  I haven't tried the cured meats but they look great! They only have a few small tables and one table for 6. You can order at the counter and then peruse their products which appear to be mostly independent or local.... not what you'd find at your big grocery stores which I always find interesting to investigate.... my husband may have gotten irritated when I ditched him to look at all the great products they carry....

I had the Benny Hills and my husband had the skillet (of the carnivorous variety). The benny had delicious Cajun spiced pork belly. The spices worked very well with the pork but maybe used a touch too much salt. I should note that the pork belly was not the melt in your mouth texture most people think of nowadays, but rather the more meaty texture you'd expect from a faster cook/grill rather than slow. The Brussels sprouts were sweet and the fresh cherry tomatoes added the needed acidity and freshness to counteract the sweetness and oiliness of the sprouts. My only complaint is that one of my poached eggs was medium instead of soft and that the Benny itself could also have used a bit more acidity... maybe a more citrusy hollandaise would have done well.

Can't say much about the skillet but Jay really enjoyed and and forbade me leaving a bad review! All in all I really enjoyed the breakfast and will definitely be back for another as well as to try some of their other products."}
{"text":"Amazing meats! Love, love, love the landjaeger sausage, it has a great buttery flavour. The pepperoni is the best I've ever had and the pricing cannot be beat. And the hog log, well that was a delicious treat! You cannot go wrong at Cured. If you want to try something before buying, they will gladly give you a sample. Support the local artisans because you are getting quality foods at not exorbitant prices."}
