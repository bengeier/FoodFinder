{"text":"we went sunday at around 1pm, party of seven. It wasn't to busy, they had only one server at the time they took our order, the food was good, but they really need help on service, no prebussing, no refills we had to raise our hand every time we need it something. they add 20% service charge to the check ( we knew that) maybe thats why they didn't care about our table, they knew they were getting a tip any way. we mentioned it to the server at the end, thats when she told us that the other server had left, cause it wasn't too busy. She  said i'm sorry and offer  to give us a free dessert or another beer."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer, wonderful food, excellent service, and Frank was great. Try the vegetarian tacos; as good or better than the meat and seafood."}
{"text":"So I was very excited to try this new place out, menu looked good. When we got there we were seated right away, our waiter was very rude and short with us, I asked him for another drink menu and he said no we have no more in the restaurant. Really horrible service....... He ignored us the whole time the guy cleaning the table was a lot nicer ..."}
{"text":"Yeah, I don't know what I like better the tacos, the beer, or our server, Frank.  :)  It literally feels like we were dining at a friends house when we come here.  Baja fish and the lengua are our our go-to picks, but the T&B salad (with steak!) and the enchiladas are winners too.  My only question is...how do I get a frequent diner punch-card? o_O"}
{"text":"I was quiet disappointed with customer service...food took long to get to us there were two other tables besides us with only two persons clearly they were not busy!!!.We were a party of six 4kids two adults,it was over priced the waitresses was horrible didn't come by to fill up our drinks or chips we waited awhile before we had to ask an employee that we were out of chips.They charged there tip on the bill we complained about bad service they said  restaurant rule they need to automatically charge tip for 6or more in a party.Doesn't make sense and it was very unfair that we got poor service and had to pay for tip.Isn't it up to us to tip a person depending on their service.I was not by any means trying to get out of tipping the waitresses but she definitely did not deserve the tip she charged us.All she did was take our order bring our drinks when we first ordered them and our bill! Definitely do not recommend this place"}
{"text":"great vibe!  wonderful spirits offering and knowledgeable bartending staff.  way worth the visit.  thanks!!"}
{"text":"This is a must stop for lunch or dinner if you're in this area in Vegas.  The taco choices are unique & amazingly delicious.  The individual portions are not huge, but their flavors are!  If you're a beer connoisseur, you'll have no problem finding a beer you enjoy. This \"off the strip\" gem is worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"quick service, awesome decor and atmosphere , food is fantastic and you don't wait long even when the place is really busy. I recommend chicken enchilada w/green sauce"}
{"text":"It's located in the same plaza on the other side of Marrakech and Satay which used to house the old Firefly location.

Came here around 1p thinking their HH was earlier than it really is but decided to check it out anyway since we were already there. Inside decor is hip and I remember hearing Empire of the Sun playing in the background. My friend noticed a Black Keys poster hanging on their wall. Got seated by the windows and started off with a passion fruit margarita, mango margarita, and chips and salsa. Margaritas were good. Preferred the passion fruit over the mango. They were flavors you can easily down. Chips and salsa were ok but for $1.95 it wasn't bad.

Ordered the corn salad, fish taco, shrimp taco, and the al pastor. My friend liked her fish taco and I liked the shrimp. The al pastor for us, was meh. We thought it wasn't as good as the fish and shrimp. I think what makes their tacos good are the tortillas they use. I could probably eat it alone. Such perfect texture. Also, don't skip out on the corn salad. Probably my favorite thing I tried here.

Service was very attentive. They consistently make sure you're doing okay but it came to the point where they checked on us so often, we felt rushed to finish our meals. 

HH is 3p-6 and 11p-close. I'd come back to check it out. The HH menu does seem like it got shorter in comparison to the past but prices are reasonable regardless."}
{"text":"The guys and crew are amazing plus super amazing tacos. Plenty aguacate on top and the tacos with HAND MADE TORTILLAS !!! PLUS the manager gave us free drinks because a mistake was made on the drinks. It was super attentitive. Definitely as local anmd mexican i am coming back over and over."}
{"text":"Don't go here!!!! This is the worst place I've been to in a very long time and it really really takes a lot for me to say that but I feel everyone needs to know so that they don't experience what I had to go through. From the beginning I knew it was a bad sign when my party and I were not greeted , not knowing if we can seat ourselves or have to wait for someone, after waiting for a minute to be seated we were told to sit anywhere and when we chose a table we were told \"you can't sit there\". What!!? So after we were given a table that we could sit at our waiter came by and took our order, well that was the only time we saw our waiter, he disappeared never to return, never checked up on us, NOTHING! Our order was wrong when it was brought to us and our side dishes didn't come until the end, the point of side dishes are to enjoy them during the meal. The food was nothing special and nothing out of the ordinary, their beans taste exactly like Hormel chilli beans and everything lacked flavor. Del taco has better tacos and beans than this place and they even sell burgers! With no service from our waiter I flagged down the busboy and then took the job of our waiter refilling our drinks and taking our plates, etc. When it came time to pay the bill it was just as awful, more like a 25min awful wait. I literally could've dined and dashed with all the opportunities I was given not being served but my party said no because karma is a bitch so I agreed. I ended up getting up to pay the bill at the front of the Resturant where I met the owner and told him about our horrible experience and he didn't seem to care, at the same time out waiter magically appeared as we were leaving and talking to his boss. After a couple of minutes of them talking our waiter came back with a revised bill, I paid him and gave the tip to our busboy. On top of all the horrible service and horrible food I ended up getting food poisoning that I still am suffering from as I write this review. DONT GO HERE! Save your money, there are way better places with better food than this place."}
{"text":"Techno Taco Tuesday is awesome. Fifty cents off all Tacos! The music is a great addition to the awesome taco selection they offer for customers. Drinks are strong and well-made, and the tacos are exquisitely put together. 

The only reason why I'm putting 4 stars and not 5 is because I feel kind of rushed outta here...they cleared items from our table so fast even though I was still picking at some of the items. 

Other than that, I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I had the barbacoa and the fried avocado ones. Just 2 tacos made me full and happy. I especially love that they make their tortillas in house. We saw her making them behind a glass. I think that makes a difference in tacos if you ask me. 

The interior design was Mexican-modern-pop-folk art is how I would guess to describe it... everywhere you look. 

Plus, great customer service and attentive servers is something so refreshing coming to a taco place. It made me want to go back again and try more items on the menu the next time."}
{"text":"The tacos are inexpensive and delicious! Their selection of draft beers and bottles is extensive and eclectic. Their waitstaff and their hostess are very helpful, polite, and fun.  When you go, you have to have the churros and the flan! Their tacos are great and the queso modelo is awesome! The best part of my Las Vegas trip was eating there each night!"}
{"text":"The BEST tacos that I've had in Vegas! Go on Tuesdays for Taco Tuesday's during 3-6 for Happy Hour. I've tried literally almost every taco and have not had a bad one yet."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Sat at the bar for Happy Hr. Marg and Tacos. Great ambiance and service. Ben the Host/Waiter who helped out from the start was fantastic. Bartenders were superb as well. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Glad me and my partner gave this joint another shot. The hospitality this evening was divine. The management team really made an effort to ensure that our experience was top notch. Our server, who had disappointed us in the past, was noticeably more attentive and personable. Maybe we caught him on a bad day in the past. Will definitely be back. The food was out of this world."}
{"text":"You must do this place for happy hour!! $2 tacos $3 Mexican beer.  The tacos were super delish.  A nice twist on Mexican meets America.  We enjoyed one al pastor and one barbacoa crunchy.  They are bigger than traditional tacos., so $2 is way cheap.  The service was great, too.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had an awesome time on the patio!  Great service...Garrick knows his beer and how to pair it!  Awesome food!  Awesome atmosphere!  AND awesome beers!  Definately my new spot for casual fun!"}
{"text":"The tacos here are so unique and flavorful. Defiantly one of the best taco places I have encountered... And I am a very picky eater!! Salsa is handcrafted and one of a kind taste. Can't complain about the prices either!!! A winning meal all around :)"}
{"text":"Great craft beer selection!!!! Great great great! Love the food and atmosphere as well. 

Have tried nearly all the tacos and all are great. Craft cocktails are good too but the beer list is impressive. Super close to the strip but away from the action. Love the location."}
{"text":"Seriously LOVE the food here. There hasn't been a time where I have came here and haven't left happy. The shrimp and fish tacos are my favorite. Another amazing dish are the carne asada fries, they are SOOOO yummy! And for dessert, the churros are a must. If you come on a Tuesday, the restaraunt turns into a lounge with the DJ spinning, super fun to come to with friends!!!"}
{"text":"So first of all, let me say that this place is amazing! The food is absolutely spectacular and fresh! The tortillas are made to order which makes the tacos that much better. The reason that I am giving it only 4 stars though is because I think that they should be open past 2 closing at 2 just doesn't work with my work schedule. I would say stay open to 3 would work much better."}
{"text":"I really like this place. After a week of conference food and very expensive food on The Strip it was very refreshing to go to Tacos and Beer which is a real restaurant at real prices. 

The ambiance is pleasant and the food is very good. I will be back each time my travel takes me to Vegas!"}
{"text":"So beyond happy I found this place. Great vegan options. Customer service is amazing as well. 
Everyone is so nice!"}
{"text":"Melissa and Armando are amazing! Melissa made me a delicious margarita and mixed some really great cocktails for my friends! The bar has great music and he conversation is great!"}
{"text":"Oh baby.... I wish I was eating one right now. This place is killer, great selection of both tacos and beer. I recommend getting the sampler then ordering your favorites. Only critique would be that the sampler doesn't identify which is which. It would be cool if the platter was labeled. Will definitely eat there again. Get off the strip and have some mother effin tacos!"}
{"text":"This is amazing, interesting mexican food made with great care. Delicious food at a surprisingly great price!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for the first time for Taco Tuesday. The tacos are the best tacos I have ever tasted! I will definitely be back just for the food. The drinks are great, & the red salsa is one of the best I have ever tasted!"}
{"text":"This place sucks big time is over priced and all the food taste the same.
First and last time I came to this place."}
{"text":"Excellent! Local vibes. Creative menu. Everything we ordered was delicious. Shrimp taco highly recommended along with bacon wrapped jalapenos. A nice break from prices and selection on the strip. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"From all the tacos I have tasted in Las Vegas, Tacos and Beer are the best! I highl y recommend them. You need to come and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Frank is very awesome #kid who asked signature he should get promoted and the water guy"}
{"text":"This place needs a wake up call. The service is very sloppy. I had a reservation at 6:30 with family. The table was good and ready but we didn't get a server to ask us what we wanted til 40 min later. Let alone we didn't start eating til a whole hour later. The food is good but not worth the hassle. Plus it's really loud in there so we had to huddle together to even have a conversation."}
{"text":"We just recently moved to Vegas and my husband and I are always looking for great places to eat, whether it's fancy or casual.  My husband loves beer and tacos and this place was amazing.  The best tacos and a very extensive menu of beers which my husband was very impressed by being the beer expert that he is.  Alberto brought us out our food and it was delicious, the owner or manager brought my husband a tasting of beer of a keg that was just open and it was great!  Great atmosphere and food and we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I definitely enjoyed the food that we ordered here. The crispy fish tacos and the bbq taco was very delicious. i do wish that had a wider selection of appetizer, i just ordered chips and guacamole and wasn't really interested in anything else. (but that's just me)

I did go during the slow time so my server was very attentive and made sure that everything was ok. I enjoy the atmosphere of this restaurant and their alcohol selection. I would like to come back and try some of more of their unique tacos."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. When we arrived the patio was closed. They opened it for us, and I cant remember having a more pleasant evening in recent memory. The tacos were good, the margaritas better, but getting the attentive service is what makes going out to a place like this worthwhile. Special shouts out to Oscar, a most gracious and welcoming staff member."}
{"text":"Natalie is one of my favorite bartenders I've ever met in Vegas! If your in the area, make sure to sit at the bar and request her, it will make your whole experience complete!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Las Vegas for the first time, and this was hr first place I went to. What a great decision on my part, as this place is A1. Cool vibes and a really friendly staff. Ridiculous selection of tacos and beers, so you can go back a handful of times and switch it up. Anytime I visit Las Vegas, this place is an automatic to visit."}
{"text":"This is our first time at Imperial Taco's and Beer.  Our food and server Alberto were excellent!!! We definitely will be coming back...."}
{"text":"I always come here bc the tacos are so good but every time I get the worst service. I keep giving them another chance but they seriously need to get it together with their horrible service. I timed it on my phone and it took 10 min before a server came over and that was after I flagged him down. He rudely told me to hold on. Exactly 20 min after being here we finally got our drinks. Food was fantastic. But once again service was terrible. They should have more servers on if they can't give good service"}
{"text":"This place is so good that if I was a local I wouldn't review it because I would want to keep it secret. But I'm not a local so I must admit that this place is awesome.  Fresh and flavorful with great service. Homemade choco tacos for dessert."}
{"text":"Great Tacos, especially the one with Chicharron inside of it. The Jalapeño Martini is pretty good as well..."}
{"text":"I wanted to check this place out being that there has been such rave reviews.  I will say that the idea of the ambiance that was created was very inviting and  had somewhat of an authentic feel to it. Once we were greeted and seated, we started to notice that there was quite a bit of disorder and chaos near and around the kitchen area.  The waitress took longer than most places to take our order. Once we received our food, which was mediocre to say the least, it felt as though employees were hovering over us.  We felt very rushed and uncomfortable.  I looked around and noticed that they were doing that with all the tables.  Just a word of advice, if you are looking to enjoy a meal at your pace without helicopter employees, I would not recommend Imperial Tacos & Beer.  I honestly think that with the proper training in this industry to bring it up to standards, this place could have potential.  At this point, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"So good! Carne asada fries were bomb! Tacos were fire... and the churros were amazing! I would come back for the churros alone!!! The staff is nice and beer selection is on point. Tacos and beer"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. We came in and ordered 6 different tacos in order to get an appropriate idea of the restaurants flavor. Shrimp taco was fishy. Pork was flavorless. Beef taco actually had a piece of melted plastic. A joke. The manager was amazing and actually comped our whole meal but I still am giving one star because the food was not even worth that."}
{"text":"Great food and churros are on point! I recommend  carna Asada taco  restaurant is sociable and has a great atmosphere to enjoy yourself  and your company."}
{"text":"While waiting for our flight home to CA we were in need of somewhere to eat.. we drove around for a while and we discovered Taco's & Beer! We knew we had to go- the name says it all! We were quickly seated and began looking at the menu and we realized we found a great place! The tacos all sounded amazing! 
Ruy was our server and he was great! Very friendly and informative. Our favorites were the Taco Baja, Al Pastor, and the Puerco Verde.

If we ever find ourselves in Las Vegas again we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you have never had real Mexican food then you will find this place acceptable. If you don't mind paying for your chips and salsa or $7-10 for a beer, then hey that's ok. If you don't mind watered -down salsa or guacamole that taste like its from the grocery store, then go ahead and go in. This place is nothing but a trendy over-priced hipster place. If you just want a place to meet friends off the strip then  it's ok but if you're looking for real Mexican food, this place is not it."}
{"text":"On our recent trip to Vegas we were looking for something reasonably priced that was open a little later (dinner around 9:30pm.) We also decided to include the idea of going off the strip, and after a random search of restaurants not too far from our hotel selected Tacos  Beer.

We were pleasantly surprised to have discovered this hidden gem.  It was dead when we arrived (only 2 other people inside) which we were a little worried about at first, but any worries we had quickly went away once we got the food.  The guacamole was delicious and the tacos were some of the tastier ones I've had in quite a while (my favorite was the baja fish taco.)  The cilantro-lime rice (side) was also very delicious.  Staff were very friendly and attentive.

Overall a great value, tacos were an average of $3 a piece.  For dinner for 4 of us with two rounds of beer the bill came to a very reasonable $100...and it was definitely worth exploring slightly off the beaten path of the strip."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place and decided we would use Postmates to get it. Food was pretty good. Ceviche had a great spice and flavor and the flautas were crispy. My issue was that a good portion of our order was incorrect. I asked for 3 sides of green salsa and got some red flavorless stuff. Props for labelling it the flautas sauce, but fail on being what I asked for. Luckily I'm saving them for leftovers. The ceviche was good but I felt like it was weirdly chunky. If everything had been cut finer, it would have been even better. 

The carne asada fries were a total fail. My boyfriend asked for no beans or guac and both were on there. Cheese wasn't shredded so getting extra created just pockets I'd melted cheese. 

Frustrating because the receipt showed exactly what we wanted but they didn't seem to pay any attention."}
{"text":"Husband and I stopped her mid afternoon on a Sunday while traveling from out of town. Really loved the variety of tacos. We started with the chips and salsa, both salsas were really well balanced. Was looking for something on the lighter side so I went with the grilled fish and veggie. The potato puree in the veggie taco was flavorful and really filling. My husband went with a variety of pork tacos and enjoyed all of them, although he really couldn't distinguish between all of them. Finished our meal with the flan and churros. Both were very flavorful. The flan was one of the best that I have ever tasted. 

I will say that the service was a bit slow. I did notice that the tortillas are all freshly made, which is a nice touch, but the chips and salsa took awhile to come out. We also had 3 different servers which was a bit confusing."}
{"text":"Just an overall disappointing experience. Sunday around 7:30pm. The food was just ok. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat it again. The servers were decent when they actually acknowledged our presence. As we waited and waited and waited for our bill and our server to come back in the building we counted the employees. Including kitchen staff and bar tenders there were approximately 15 employees onsite. They seemed to be more interested in each other than the customers. Some looked like they may have been off the clock or just hanging out but still went back and forth behind the bar and in the kitchen so it's hard to say. It was painfully difficult to get someone's attention. Mind you there were only about 20 or so customers in the place. We finally got our bill and waited another 10 minutes or so for someone to pick it up.  We even joked that it felt like a prank show to see how long we could keep our cool! Again, disappointing!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! The service was incredible and the tacos were delicious! 
The manager, Armando, was friendly and treated our large group (10 people) with amazing hospitality. On top of that, our server Alan did a great job handling multiple bills all while staying on top of our needs. Overall great experience, I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Today was our first time trying tacos and beer. The food was absolutely delicious and the atmosphere was fun. Allan was our waiter and he was kind enough to go through everything on the menu with us. Overall a great experience and terrific food. I would highly recommend this restaurant to others. The crunchy beef taco was the best"}
{"text":"save your time and energy-
horrible service for the third time in a row. we tried to go to lunch today, walked in, sat at the bar, ordered from the bartender and then attempted to get a table, were seated at a table, and waited and waited and waited, 45 minutes went by and still no food. 
ugh i won't go here ever again. third time recently that we have tried to eat here, because it used to be great-somethign happened and we will never go back. we ended up leaving after 45 minutes with still no food. what a waste of time and energy. do your self a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Bad costumer services, waiter did not introduced himself. Had the runner just drop of the waters without saying Hi. Not a friendly place, everyone look like they had a hangover. Will I come here again, NOPE."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Taco varieties are vast and tasty! Beer is cold and frosty-Must stop when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Last night after a few drinks my fiancée and I were in need of some quick, cheap and delicious drunk food. At first we were thinking fast food but then we passed by tacos and beer and thought, why not! And we were not disappointed at all. We ordered guacamole and added corn, bacon and cities. It was absolutely delicious, had some hint of spice, lots of crumbled, crispy bacon and sweet corn. Our tacos came out shortly after. The prices were amazing, most expensive was shrimp at $3.95 and a lot were under $3. I got shrimp and carne asada, and they were the best tacos I have had in Las Vegas. They were big, over flowing with pico sauce, guac and meat. If you are a fan of shrimp tacos, you have to try the ones at tacos and beer. My fiancée got lengua, carnitas and beef barboca and each of his were better than the last. Each taco had an array of fillings and sauces and the flavored were perfect. We didn't try any drinks (had just come from a bar) but next time for sure.

The only downside is that it took a pretty long time for our waitress to come over and get our order, but the food quickly made up for that minor misstep on the waitress' end. 

We will definitely be heading back to this place very soon and often."}
{"text":"Loved the Tacos and burritos bit I think the kids should stay at home. It's not really catered toward them"}
{"text":"Horrible Service, I came with a group of 8 and it took us forever to get anyone to serve us and we were seated already! Not only that but I asked for chips two times and still no one brought my group anything. I mean come on, we know we are a large group and your tip is basically already included but how hard is it to bring chips to the table. my Co-worker had to go up to the bar to ask for his beer again because they never brought it to him. If it was a busy day I would understand but its a small place and they had enough servers! Their food wasn't bad but the service is what made it a bad over all experience."}
{"text":"Vegan tacos!!!!!!!! They are so delicious. I can't wait to go back and I'm still stuffed from the meal we just had there. The fried avocado, jackfruit and veggie tacos were amazing. The vegetable empanadas were the probably my favorite. The drinks were great. I loved their salsa. We were a giant group with 8 kids included and the service was very nice and prompt."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I am a huge taco fan!  So when I tell you that the tacos here are some of the best tacos I've ever had, that really means something. I've been here multiple times and tried almost all the tacos so far, my favorites are the al pastor and the veggie. The al pastor is so flavorful with little chunks of pineapple on top... And you might think I'm crazy when I say the veggie taco is one of my favorites, most people like meat in their tacos, but this veggie taco is so tasty! Mashed potato in place of meat, mushrooms and what ever else veggies it has, perfect... It might just turn me vegetarian! Jk but it is very good. I'm not a beer fan at all, so I can't comment on the beers, but the cocktails I've had are the Dirty South Andy (kinda like a Moscow mule with little tweaks) and House Margarita (it has \"salt air\" instead of salted rim which is pretty unique and cool!). This place is pretty new still but I think once the word gets around it will be pretty popular!"}
{"text":"Always absolutely amazing service. Food is always served quickly and with a smile.  I love the guacamole full of chunks of avocado.  The palomas are the best around.  As a local I'm always looking for fabulous local food and ambience, this place has it.  The manager even comes out and meets the patrons.  Truly an amazing place."}
{"text":"I came here with co-workers for lunch and food was delicious... Especially the shrimp tacos. The waiter, Frank, was so nice and friendly. The service was the best!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! My boyfriend loved the craft beer selections they had. He asked for an IPA and Carlos recommended the Alaskan IPA. Great choice with intense hop flavors. Just what my boyfriend was looking for. I came solely for the tacos and loved every one that I had. The lengua, veggie, and the beef barbacoa were all delicious! Highly recommended if you're looking for great food with an awesome atmosphere. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was a very fun place to go eat, the taco selection was huge lots of different varieties not overly expensive , the food tasted wonderful, the craft beer choices we're amazing and the wait staff was great to work with, I would definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"other than EVERYTHING IS GOOD...chiquito taco platter is the way to go!! Dozen and one of each. simple and fast!!"}
{"text":"In town for a convention, went out with co-workers looking for Mexican in and around our hotel.  Great pick, got there during happy hour I sampled the street tacos, each was very good.  The guacamole was very much to my liking as I enjoy onions, no one complained.  The variety of salsas allow to each his own, I felt there was a great selection of beers and the others enjoyed happy hour Margaritas and wine.  Casual atmosphere with good food."}
{"text":"Tacos, beer.....What else could you want?

Lots of relatively unique taco choices, fish, steak, chicken, veggie, pork, they probably have a taco you'd enjoy. 

Chips are good, salsa is solid.

Everything is pretty inexpensive and they have a solid beer listing. 

Service is outstanding, especially for a place that is busy as they are."}
{"text":"One word to describe Tacos & Beer..  Delishhhh! This is a must stop every time your in Vegas. Can't beat the hamd made tortillas.  Fresh guacamole & corn salad are a great starter."}
{"text":"Cool hidden spot. Great food. Service was on point and very friendly. At night they have a cool music vibe."}
{"text":"What a marvelous find for late night dining near the Strip. The tacos were small, allowing one to try several, and flavorful with a well thought out mix of complementary ingredients.

The draft beer selection, while not exceptionally large offering about a dozen choices, was varied in style. Our exceptionally friendly and helpful server (?Kaycee) happily provided samples of the interesting choices. The margaritas were tremendous and were quite the bargain during the early and late happy hours at only $4.

P.S. and to all of the previous posters that recommened to get the pumpkin seeds added to the guacomole dip, you were all correct."}
{"text":"My go-to for tacos & beer! They offer a variety of vegetarian options for myself and plenty of meat items to keep my husband happy. It's the best of both worlds! The food is excellent along with the service. The beer selection is always on point and the margaritas are delicious. Do yourself a favor and check out this awesome, budget friendly spot."}
{"text":"BE CAREFUL! It is SO easy to fill up on the chips and salsa. Start with their delicious guacamole and be sure to add the pomegranate and pumpkin seeds for $1. Typically carne asada is the way to go, but it's definitely further down the list here. Not because it's bad, but because there are others that are simply incredible. 

If you like fish Tacos, try the grilled or fried Mahi Mahi, it's very tasty and full of flavor. The beef options are plentiful with lengua, ground, and steak. Then their are a few veggie options, which I haven't tried, and finally... The coup de grace, the pork. First is the pork Verde, which is pretty much sauce less and has (get this) pork rinds. It's very tasty. Lastly, their pork al pastor is to die for. Pineapple, some delicious sauce, perfectly prepared pork and more. Literally the perfect taco. 

On top of the food, this joint has the BEST brews in Vegas. I'm a snob about this stuff, and believe me, the selection is INCREDIBLE. 

Anyway, if you're on Yelp, you clearly will try this place out before got believe me. Do it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food. Everything from the chips and salsa to the loaded burritos were mouth watering. Also the tacos are to die for!  Definitely coming back here. The manager personally checks up on every table and makes sure nothing is less than perfect!"}
{"text":"I would give this place two and half stars. The margarita was just straight sweet and sour. We sat at the bar and I believe they had one Mexican beer on tap. Not only do you have to pay for chips and salsa you get maybe 10 chips. The guacamole was nothing special, and neither was the salsa. If you are looking for an authentic Mexican place, this is not the place. Go to somewhere on the strip, you will be paying the same prices with better people watching."}
{"text":"Great location and awesome late night local place! Diverse beer list with the best bottle and draft beer prices in town. Laid back and cool new place to check out"}
{"text":"Had a great taco Tuesday... the food was delicious... Armando our waiter and server was an exceptional server .... the whole staff made sure we were taken care of... definitely a must for taco Tuesdays..."}
{"text":"Great Tacos and Great Service
The Tacos were Fresh, very quick and they have a great selection
We will be coming back very soon
Family Friendly"}
{"text":"Man, oh man, this place has some good tacos. I'm not going to lie, I'm always hesitant of eating tacos from a restaurant considering they will never live up to my exceptions seeing as we always ate them homemade or from the neighborhood taco cart. So, I would have have gave this place 5 stars BUT I was so bugged by our server. The guy came one minute after we got the menus and seemed annoyed that we weren't ready, he offered chips and salsa and then left. Which was okay but, 15 minutes passed and we were starting to look for anyone. My boyfriend finally stared him down and he came. Now to the food, the chips and salsa, man. So good and you can taste the freshness of the chips. As for the guacamole, pretty good can use some more flavor  no complaints though. I got the chicken tinga which was really good, just tasted a tad too much like an enchilada for me not a bad thing, but I wanted taco ya know? The chicken asada, yes. Yes as in GET IT. I loved it. Back to the server so, we didn't know what to expect so we order just two tacos. Now we're just waiting on that good ol' \"how's everything\" so we can order some more. He went to all the other tables twice except us. I understood it was busy, but seriously dude? My boyfriend said screw it since another 15 mins have passed and flagged down a lady who gladly came and we figured was the manager. She took our order and even asked if we wanted more beer. More chicken asada tacos, yeah! Finally, we were content and she even came back to check up on us after that. So the gist of that was, we basically only saw our server twice. Food great! Service meh, expect for that awesome manager? Lead? Thanks, if you're reading."}
{"text":"Honestly...One of the best Mexican restaurants I have been to in a long time!!! We frequent the Vegas area once a month from California and this is the best off the strip place. I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding selection of food and a commanding presence of craft beer on tap make this establishment worth a visit or twelve. Very big fan of the cerviche."}
{"text":"Came here to have tacos and a beer.  Had an awesome beer from their extensive eclectic beer menu.  I had read that the tacos were above average in size, so I ordered two ... one pork and one chicken.  They have several varieties in pork, chicken, beef, fish, etc.  When the tacos came, they were average (or maybe a bit below average) in size, so I ordered a third taco (beef this time).  All three tacos were very good.  I thought the food was maybe a bit overpriced for what you get and for the atmosphere (nothing special)."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever and great selection on the beers, should try the puerco verde and adobada!

Best food,bar,customer service ever.

Best new spot on vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on 8/16. 
They had a good happy hour. The drinks were tasty. They had an amazing selection of beer. Their staff was nice. You can get your tacos as nachos. Genius! The corn salad, queso & beer, puerco verde tacos, steak salad and the tortilla soup were all legit! Did i mention they make all their tortillas fresh! The music and the atmosphere was seriously a lot of fun. Great vibe. Everyone was dancing on the patio while inside the restaurant it was not too loud and the ambiance was nice so you could enjoy your dinner and have conversation too. We had a great time. No wonder Imperial Tacos & Beer won Best of Las Vegas for Best Underground Night Spot!"}
{"text":"This place is really good! They have A LOT of options for tacos. I have been here many many times and have tried a lot of tacos, but I usually get the al pastor, baja fish, and puerco verde. The other tacos I have tried are the crunchy, carne asada, cochinita pibil, carnitas, barbacoa, and shrimp. All of the tacos are good! You pretty much can't go wrong, but my least favorites are the carne asada and crunchy chicken, but that's not to say those are bad just the others are better. The salsa they give you for the tacos in the little bottles are also good- I personally like the mild salsa  and the hot salsa. 

Chips and salsa or chips and guac are good for starters too, just wish it was a free starter. Another good starter I enjoy getting is the corn salad. Also, the margaritas are really good! 

I would highly recommend making a reservation for Taco Tuesday since wait can be pretty long, but the Taco Tuesday deal is just 50cents off each taco. The only other downside is that it's kind of pricey for tacos."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, Felicia is a fox of a bartender!! They also have an incredible beer list, one of the best draft lists in town. And an awesome bottle list with some pretty hard to find beers. I mean with a name like tacos and beer how do you go wrong."}
{"text":"Tried this first time. Nice decor. Went for happy hour ok tacos not very HAPPY most of available tacos regular price. Had a beer and glass of house wine. $11 house wine on happy hour seriously. Definitely not value for money."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Vegas, we bought a Groupon for 6 tacos and 2 sides. There were two of us and this was the perfect amount of food. They bring salsa and refried beans to the table as starters (free). I thought the beans were a nice touch. Both were delicious! We each ordered 3 tacos and both chose different ones.  There wasn't a single complaint! The tacos were so tasty and I personally enjoyed every one that I had. We felt like we got such a great deal with the Groupon. We sat outside so can't comment on the decor but outside was nice even though you look out towards a parking lot and the restaurant is along a road. We still couldn't complain given the location...it was a wonderful find since we're out-of-towners!"}
{"text":"So looking forward to eating here. Get there 30 min prior to a nba conference final game. Planning on staying for the entire game.  1 hour later he only 3 fucking tacos I've ordered have not arrived mean while everyone around me has eaten. I ask to just close my bill I went to just get the fuck outta this shit hole. The check comes.. Yea of course they're trying to charge me for the tacos they did not even serve me.  Fuck this over priced place go to tacos el gordo and get authentic tacos more per order and cheaper and you'll actually get your fucking order.. How do you run a tapas restaurant and you can't get an order that consist of 3 tacos down correctly or even at all when the place has as many people dining as I can count with one hand.  Fucking Ridiculous! I'm so pissed!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a find! If you're a foodie and you love Mexican food then you have to visit Imperial Tacos and Beer! My wife and I tried several different selections and found all of them to have a very vibrant and colorful taste! Plus the lime rice has to be one of the best I've ever had. Also they serve their tacos in a soft corn tortilla that they make fresh as soon as you place your order! The staff was very friendly and attentive and the price was definitely right! We will be back before we leave town!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  Food is just ok and the service may be the worst in the city!  A friend and I went for an early dinner, around 6 pm.  The place was hardly half full.  We waited for quite some time before we were even greeted.  Then the greeting consisted of, \"do you want to start with margaritas?\" When we declined the drinks, the server left and a different server came back 10 mins later to take our food order.   We started with chips and guac which were mediocre, a little bland.  So we thought we add some spice.  We asked for hot sauce and continued asking for it, 3 times to be exact, didn't get it till our tacos came out.  I don't know if maybe they were having an off day but will definitely not be back to waste my money.     I am a very understand customer especially being that I work in that industry but man, it was honestly that bad!"}
{"text":"In a word...awesome. From the name I expected a simple taco joint and some coronas. I was more than pleasantly surprised. Their tacos are ala cart so if you're a fatty it can get expensive, but it gives you the freedom to sample the menu. Tacos are delicious, I had carne asada, crunchy chicken and chorizo, all three were fantastic. The crunchy tacos come with mashed potatoes which may sound odd but was quite delicious. Also tried the carne asada fries and was impressed, great thick cut carne asada steak, decent fries and plenty of toppings. Beer selection is quite above what I expected, quite a few local brews, decent cider selection. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Very few places have such good food and depressing service. This place has potential, but as someone with 15+ yrs experience in the industry, in my opinion this establishment needs some serious management, my wife and i came in three different times, not once were we  satisfied with the service, food and margaritas are great. But their servers and sertain Bartenders are definately in the wrong industry.

 F.Y.I. Miserable service=miserable tips guys."}
{"text":"Tacos And Beer is awesome!

My husband and I have eaten here several times, and we love it more with each visit.

The atmosphere is great. The decor is really unique and inviting.

The staff is friendly, and helpful. The bartenders were very knowledgeable of their extensive beer menu. If you're a fan of great craft beer, Tacos and Beer is the place to go. They have an amazing selection of hard to find craft brews. Everything from imperial stouts for my husband, to wild sour beers, and even honey mead for me. The general manager, Dave, knows more about beer than anyone I've ever met. He was kind enough to introduce us to, what are now, several of our favorite beers!


And the food is absolutely delicious! Chips and guacamole are great. Oh and the beer cheese dip is ridiculous. We've tried most of the tacos and love them all. Our favorites are; the crunchy tacos with mash potatoes, the puerco verde with pork rinds, the beef adobada, and the pork al pastor. The flautas are also great! We have also eaten dessert there, and my goodness, the flan is amazing, definitely the best flan I've ever had. The churros are really great as well.

Overall, this is just a great restaurant in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"On my way to jersey mike's decided to stop and check it out. I decided to order 3 tacos to go and my friend order 2 tacos...it took 30 minutes to get my 3 tacos. The hostess was very apologetic but i figured they would offer me some chips and salsa or even a soft drink while we waited. Prices are pretty high for an off the strip taco place.  $12 for 3 tacos.  The Al Pastor taco was good. The Chicken tinga was bland with not much flavor."}
{"text":"Tacos & Beer is muy delicious! happy hour starts at 11pm which includes $2 beers and $3 tacos! My favorite is the pork verde tacos. Super nice employees and a very cool vibe a must see for locals and visitors."}
{"text":"Great restaurant from the moment we entered the door. Our server Alyssa and all the staff were on top of everything, didn't have to ask for a thing. Great place to eat, sit, and chat. The manager was respectful and took care of us. Will definitely come back soon, 10/10!"}
{"text":"Holy goodness was this place amazing. My wife and I really enjoyed the tacos and the beverages. She ordered a passionfruit margarita, and I ordered one of the local beers. When on the west coast, it's only necessary to order fish tacos - which were nothing short of fantastic! The Baja fish were battered fish with fresh slaw and other authentic sauces and seasonings. She ordered carne and chicken asada tacos and loved them as well. The atmosphere was also very comforting and down to earth. We highly recommend eating at this place, if more than 5 stars could be given it would definitely happen!"}
{"text":"The food was great! Service below expectations. What ruined it for me was a chef walking around drinking beer outside with patrons.  Then he came inside walking around with beer in hand giving employees direction. Then he asked some patrons to do shots with him at the bar. Not very professional."}
{"text":"Tried this place for a quick lunch near the Convention Center. Service was not good. The hostess ended up being our waitress too, and she was unfriendly from the moment we entered the door. The bartender looked like he was offering much better service but unfortunately we were seated in the main dining room and experienced the slow and unfriendly service instead. 

I ordered a soft drink & it literally took between 5-10 minutes. She wanted to take our order as soon as we sat down but since it was our first visit we needed a moment with the menu. It took another almost 10 minutes for her to return. It wasn't as it they were slammed or too busy, just bad service.

That being said, the food was really good & I would be willing to give it another shot sometime, maybe for happy hour."}
{"text":"They charged me an extra $2 because I ordered my drink neat. They charged my friend an extra $3 for a drink on the rocks. Both extra charges were on top of the cost of the drink listed on the menu. Neither additional charge was disclosed on the menu. 

The manager did credit us for the extra charge after we complained."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever . Great service and good prices. The Crunchy taco is the best . Since las year i'm visiting this place during my vacations at Vegas . Highly Recommended this place."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot!!! Great beer selection, reasonable prices, chill ambiance, cute decor and everything about the food, all the way to their hot sauces, were delicious. To top it off- the service was no less than perfect! Favorites: Easy Jack beer on tap & Pastor Tacos. Love you, Tacos & Beer!"}
{"text":"I have done pick up since place is so close to my job but last Friday was first time I at inside. The food is awesome but service is not that great. It took over 15 minutes to get our 2nd drink order placed and another 20 minutes before they even brought them back. They weren't even busy so I don't know why they took so long. Also I wanted to try the frozen margarita with sangria but the sangria wasn't frozen so had to settle for a a regular frozen margarita."}
{"text":"TACOS HERE ARE AMAZING.

The Baja Fish taco is my favorite. Other good choices I made were: Beef Barbacoa, Puerco Verde, Chicken Tinga, and Carne Asada. Went great with the jalapeno margarita!

Will definitely return next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Been back a dozen times now, this place never fails to impress. The modeo quest on the nachos is to die for, and if you like spice both of the house habanero salas are fantastic. Service is friendly and personable, and the atmosphere is lovely. Get well decorated and an amazing bar with a great beer list. One of my favorite spots. Had Oscar as a server before and he is always great."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. The food was very good. Guacamole was awesome!  Service was adequate on a not terribly busy Sunday night."}
{"text":"Tacos are good service by server was okay friend accidentally dropped her Tequila shot and was told by management they couldn't replace it lol, after my 60 + dollar tab it would have been nice to replace the tequila but I guess I'll take my business else where !"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, very cool environment. The bean and cheese tacos and tortilla soup were fantastic."}
{"text":"Lengua, Cochinita Pibil and Chicken Tenga are the beyond amazing! Super good food and great service."}
{"text":"Love tacos and beer! The service, especially Oscar, is the best!! Come here at least once a week :)"}
{"text":"All of the Tacos and Apps we have had here have been incredible. The place can get kinda crazy on Taco Tuesday and the tacos are a bit pricey compared to some other options in town but they really are worth it as a treat once in awhile. Good selection of Mexican Beers and liquors as well to compliment your tacos."}
{"text":"Do these people not have taste buds? Not only was I disappointed but I was shocked for how much the bill was for the 3 tacos and a drink. First off I'm Mexican and in no way does this food taste authentic. The tacos were dry and the the mix paloma drink was awful. This place honestly makes Roberto's taco shop seem delicious. Save yourself the trouble and just go to firefly. The food may be expensive there but at least the ceviche they make will be 10 times better than at this place."}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego, home of authentic and BOMB Mexican tacos.  It's hard to find a place that measures up to tacos from home.  While out for July 4th weekend in Las Vegas, we stumbled upon his Mexican joint that has good tacos and a wonderful environment.  Alberto, our server, was super friendly and made our experience wonderful.  I recommend the chorizo tacos...my favorite!!   I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a good time and excellent food! Home away from home."}
{"text":"I love the idea of this place and the atmosphere is great. The tacos are amazing and the margaritas are of the perfect ratio. BUT there service is horrible. The waitresses are rude and have no idea what they're doing. Every time I've gone it's been the same thing, the men waiters are clueless but not as bad as the clueless and obviously rude waitresses. It's been nice but I'm not coming back here. P.s- Why the heck do I have to wear a bright yellow wrist band to eat tacos and have margaritas?"}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos Tuesday in Las Vegas. A must do! The manager Manuel was also very attentive and came over multiple times to check on our table. Even with how busy it was! Great vibe and great food!"}
{"text":"Place was pretty good. I had a steak quesadilla which was really crispy. I also had two tacos but felt the price for the taste of them didn't really match up. Good place for a dinner and a chat with family and friends though just a 3star for the price per taco"}
{"text":"This place is great. It's got a cool atmosphere and a good selection of beer. The fish tacos and the best. And be sure to get chips and try their green sauce."}
{"text":"This place was on point! The tacos were delicous and their flavored margaritas were DELICOUS. The price was right and the tacos wrr yummy. I will definitely be back when I am in avegas for sure."}
{"text":"Tacos had- cochinita pibil, pork al pastor, Baja fish.  All delicious, unique and quick. Came on a Tuesday, which happens to be \"Taco Tuesday!\"- $.50 off. Jackpot!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. The queso modelo is really yummy. The ceviche is a lil too tarty for me but could be good for others. Great Great service from Frank."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, all the tacos are great, the flan is awesome too.
Been in Vegas three days and have been here twice already. Service is good, even though it was busy both times we stopped."}
{"text":"Vegas is known for its dinning...  Do yourself a favour and get off the strip and enjoy a night at T&B.  On the word of a local, we took 20 ppl to this spot.  The staff was amazing and the food matched!  Armando (server) was fantastic and I wished I knew the names of the others who pitched in and helped as they deserve a huge shout out too...  Personal favourite - the Pork Enchiladas!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in this place. The worst tacos I've ever tasted. Maybe it was just the night but it was terrible. Fish taco was so fishy and was cold. It's hard to mess up a carne asada taco, well they did. Tough meat, cold tortilla. Yuck. And the bbq taco... they don't make them for a reason."}
{"text":"What a great find!  Comfortable atmosphere and friendly and attentive staff.  The guacamole is a must have.  The flautas are amazing.  Cant say enough about the tacos!  Al pastor is the best I have had.  Fish and shrimp tacos are amazing, as are the carne as well.  Great selection of beers as well.  I will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Tried coming here on Tuesday night for a late dinner around 10pm. They said everyone had to pay a $5 cover because they had a DJ or something. How tacky. They missed out on a group that would have spent over $100 because they tried to shake down their customers at the door. I explained that we just wanted dinner and weren't trying to go to their outdoor club thing, but they said everyone must pay. Good thing there were other food options in the plaza."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and beers. I would come back when I'm in town again. The food was good and tasty."}
{"text":"The food order came out all wrong and then when it did come we were pretty disappointed in the food. It was not at all authentic and for such a high rank we expected much more. And to pay for chips and salsa at a mexican restaurant, What? Definitely not coming back. Food tasted alright though."}
{"text":"Great stuff. Will definitely be going back next time I am in Vegas. Tacos and Beer were great for me and the wife liked the margaritas. Extensive tap list."}
{"text":"Was seated immediately on Sunday evening. Our waitress, Kaley, was very pleasant and helpful as we were deciding what to order.  I decided to try the chicken enchiladas mole with charro beans. I really liked the flavor of my meal, but the enchiladas were not hot, they were cooked, just not warm. With that being said, I still ate them.  I also tried a couple of bites of my husband's fish and beef barbacoa tacos. Again, good flavors but the beef was a little chewy. Kaley responded pleasantly when we provided the feedback. We ordered flan for dessert, which was also good, a lot of caramel in a custard with a firm texture.  Overall, I would give them a second chance but would ask them to check the enchiladas if I ordered them again."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and our server Justin knew exactly what beers paired with what we ordered. Past experiences here have been par at best, but having a server who knew the food and beers well changed my opinion on this place! Definitely will be returning and requesting him as my server!"}
{"text":"Delicious appetizers and food! Tacos were different in a good way. Never though mashed potatoes would be so bomb in a taco. 10/10 highly recommend!"}
{"text":"staff are really pleasant.   I recommend him to all my friends and family................. Love it will be bk"}
{"text":"Tacos & Beer is my favorite late night taco spot in Vegas!

FOOD: I have yet to try anything bad on their menu. Everything is made fresh and delicious. They a huge taco menu with over 30 different tacos to chose from. The fish taco is my absolute favorite. When I'm not in the mood for tacos, I usually get the nachos. It is huge portion that is great for sharing. I recently started order the Queso Fundito (cheese sauce with toppings and served with chips) and the Queso Modelo (cheese skillet served with tortillas). Both dishes are great as appetizers as well as for topping your tacos. Whatever you chose to order, make sure you ask for their delicious hot sauces. Lastly, tacos are $0.50 less on Taco Tuesdays!

DRINKS: It goes without saying, you should be drinking beer with your tacos at Tacos & Beer. They do serve pitchers of margaritas if you want to share with a group.

ATMOSPHERE: Service here always amazes me. I often go with a big group of friends. The waiters here never mess up our super long orders and they are able to seperate all our checks. The food comes out quickly and they are attentive to their customers. Once, I dropped a lime on the ground, within seconds, the waiter brought me a whole plate a limes without me even asking!"}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience!!!! Bacon wrapped jalapeños the best we order I order them had to order two more sooo good!!!! Bought a t-shirt loved it so much... Manager Carlos stopes over to make sure we all wee having a great time. The server Armando was really great separate checks for a party of 12 kept our table clear and was on top of serving our needs!!!!   One word amazing...."}
{"text":"TACOS AND BEER.....We tried several items and they kept getting more delicious as we went through the menu. Guacamole the best. Ceviche sent from heaven. With the best staff in the business."}
{"text":"Really good tacos at a price you can't beat. I love the Rajas Con Crema, roasted poblano, mushrooms, onion, corn with oaxaca cheese and poblano cream. I love the corn and cole slaw sides. Great service. Put it on your list to try. Good beer selection too."}
{"text":"This little corner of heaven is fantastic and the service was awesome. I like that they have a vast variety of spirits! My favorite taco was Cochinita Pibil Taco, which was a great recommendation from our server Ben. The enviroment is low key and relaxed and the food stands out on its own."}
{"text":"Great beer selections. We had a flight with sours and IPAs.  Not a bad one in the bunch. We loved the tacos, they have great veggie options like fried avocado,  and sweet potato.  Gish and shrimp too."}
{"text":"Great place with diverse menu of Tacos.
The service was EXCELLENT.Allen was our waiter and he made some great recommendations ( like a pitcher of Margarita's . Even the Hostess Lacey went out of her way to make our meal great. She went out of her way to help me grow my sticker collection. The Mgr. Armando was always helping the staff bus tables and fill our many drinks.
Give this place a shot and you will be very pleased.
With a name like Taco and Beer how can you go wrong!"}
{"text":"came on a Thursday night. had the shrimp, baja fish and barbacoa tacos. they were all decent, nothing to really rave about. wait time was about 30 min. waiter was attentive but got all the orders wrong and tried to compensate by giving us free tacos."}
{"text":"Food was dry no flavor. Hot sauce taste like soy sauce with a bit of heat flavor added. All hype. Wouldn't eat here ever again. Even if was the last place on earth. Facts!!! Tacos taste like there wrapped in autumn leafs !"}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great beer selection. We were there on Techno Taco Tuesday, so they ended up shuffling our table around a bit as they arranged for that, and each time they moved us we got a free round, which is the right way to do it. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Our server, Alberto, and the manager Manuel, are fantastic!  The food is so good that the next time I'm in Vegas, I will eat here. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great Food!  Tacos were amazing and the service was excellent. Alberto did a great job! I will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for late night tacos and a night cap.  Had four different tacos. 1. Beef Barbacoa.  Delicious, moist and flavorful.  The meat was tender.  2. Chicken tinga.  Super tender and moist. Salty but sweet?!?  3. Puerco verde.  Same as the barbacoa.  Moist flavorful.  Not too spicy.  Oh, and served with a handful of pork cracklings on top 4.  Pork al pastor.  This was my favorite.  I love the hot spicy of the pork and the cooling sweet of the pineapple.  And a small swath of crema on top.  Yum.  
Only one complaint. The tortillas which are made in house, were cold.  I'm sure there's a reason for this. But I prefer warmed taco tortillas.  
Would I come back? Hell yes.  I think it's a bargain. The food was top notch, and fairly priced.  These aren't street tacos. And they're not Taco Bell tacos either."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely overrated. The only two things I liked about the place were, the over all ambiance & the fish tacos. Everything else tasted basically the same & very average. The sour and acidic sauce overpowered the taste of everything else & gave us a horrible heartburn afterwards. Our food server never checked on our table & we had to wait 25 minutes for our check. I saw he was Overwhelmed with too many tables. Meanwhile the hostess at the podium was just standing there and chatting with her friends and doing absolutely nothing. She could've totally see us waiting for a check and help but she even didn't bother to leave the podium and see what's going on."}
{"text":"Food was good and service good. Not THE best Mexican I've had in Vegas but inventive and fun. Great guacamole nice and chunky and fresh. Atmosphere was disappointing however. We were in early on a Saturday but felt very BLAH"}
{"text":"First time eating here. The food was excellent. Loved the Puerco Verde tacos. There House Specialty Charro Beans where yummy. Our server Alberto was awesome. We will be back."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm blown away. Super cool environment. And crazy in love with the veggie tacos. A new variation and take on it. No more just rice and beans only.:)
Hand made tortillas and to top it all of the best guacamole I ever had. Delicious!!! I recommend it to everyone. New favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. And it's close to the strip."}
{"text":"Super good food. Good location off the strip but close enough to uber. Service was outstanding. They seemed to think they took too long on an order so we got free dessert, which was outstanding. Cool environment, love the decor. Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Had lunch beers. And tacos. Frank waited on us and was amazing. Super friendly. And all over keeping us topped off with beers and margaritas. It's our Xmas tradition to shop and get beers and today was great. Thanks Frank. Merry Christmas."}
{"text":"Came after work with friends to try it out as a first timer. It was Great food and great drinks. Luis was great and took care of our group!!!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place.  Believe they have changed hands in the last year.  Music was loud hip hop, food was cold when we got it.  They did however comp all the food we ordered."}
{"text":"Great spot! The food was incredibly good! The service was attentive and friendly. Techno Taco Tuesday was a blast outside! Great house music with a fun unpretentious vibe. Wish the dance floor had more space cause we danced so much! Can't wait to come back for Nacho House!"}
{"text":"This place have good customer  service.... best taco place....   There flan is bomb ... I would come back here again ....."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden diamond just behind The Strip.....perfect for a relaxing dinner or lunch...one of the best tacos in the city plus the best selection of beer. This guys have an constantly updated board with beer selection...i always try something different. Also they honor my Delta Skymiles membership and i always get miles for it....love this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best tacos I have had in Las Vegas ! Today was my first time and I will be back often . I am not a big meat eater so I ordered there bean and cheese as we'll as a potato taco and the here amZing"}
{"text":"Came for the fish tacos, which were highly reviewed. Tried both the grilled and the Baja and they were equally mediocre and unmemorable. 

But the Rajas de crema taco - that was a dark horse winner! Ordered a 2nd one for dessert :)"}
{"text":"I come here constantly. This was the WORST experience I've ever had (9/2 5:20-6ish) I was ignored the whole time I was seated at the bar. Every encounter that I made with the bartender (there were three men behind the bar) was because I flagged them down. Finally, I was able to flag down a bartender toward the end of my meal. He asked me, \" Is there anything else I needed.\" I proceeded to say, \"yes, there was\" and he turned his head, ignored me, went back to the conversation he was having with these two men who were clearly his friends. When he finally got around to acknowledging me I asked him if it was customary to ask how a customer how they are doing and then promptly ignore them while they're trying to convey their needs. He apologized and gave me a margarita on the house. Too little, too late. I'd rather pay for hat I received and get the service I'm due. I have frequented this establishment at least once every two weeks since it opened. Not anymore. I have recommended this place to countless people. Not any more. I have taken out of town guests here. Not any more. Maybe if I were a man, maybe if I were white maybe then I would elicit some respect in the eyes of these bartenders. At least, enough to be acknowledged when I'm spending money at the establishment where they are being paid to do just that. AWFUL."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from here several times & have dined in a couple of times. Generally when getting take out my order is correct but there has been an occasional wrong taco here & there. Service was good when dining at the restaurant at the bar and a table. 

One of my favorite appetizers is the bacon wrapped jalapeños in a chili sauce. Absolutely amazing! The somewhat smokey  flavor of the sauce really makes it. I Haven't had a taco I didn't like yet. Some odd ones are the jackfruit....wired texture but good & crunchy chicken with mashed potatoes....surprisingly good. Overall solid place."}
{"text":"Guacamole was delicious and so are their tacos and sides. Highly recommend. They also have a huge beer selection."}
{"text":"I loved the chicken tacos. The shell was a fresh corn tortilla that was out of this world. Each taco was flavorful and fresh. I was there for the $5 margaritas and those were delicious as well. Service was great; food arrived fast and a great atmosphere to sit with friends to eat, drink and chat."}
{"text":"First time here! Had a few modelo Negras and a couple of micheladas which were good. We also ordered some tacos. I ordered the 8.95 mini taco special so I could try a few different meats. I ordered chicken tinga.. Carne asada and bbq beef. They were tasty I was just surprised how small they ended up being! My love
Ordered 3 tacos.. Shrimp .. Al pastor .. And chorizo. Overall it was good and I would come come again!"}
{"text":"Was there last night for their techno taco Tuesdays ordered a beer gave the guy $20 bill came back with four dollar bills so I try to confront the guy but  he kept trying to avoid me and not talk to me so I threw an ice cube very lightly he kept avoiding me and I was trying to get his attention well I did and I told him that he shortchange me I guest he knew because he had to change already ready for me in his hand ... so I go outside and drink my drink and security asked me to leave seriously just because you shortchange me I have to leave this place that is some BS and the place smells like sewer every time I go in there ...The owner has the worst case of little man syndrome I've ever seen and I wont be going back . Make sure your count your change"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The waiter Alberto was friendly and nice. Nice and cool vibe from the restaurant. The price was great"}
{"text":"Though the chips and salsa are not complimentary, they are only about $3 and are pretty tasty. It is served with a red and a green salsa; the green is a bit milder than the red and they were both fresh tasting. The tacos themselves were good. I had the carne asada and the carnitas. The carnitas were good, but the meat itself was a bit bland. It was topped with a crumble of chicharones, which was a good offset to the tender meat. The carne asada had very tender and flavorful beef and it was tasty. Between the two tacos, I preferred the carne asada. 

What I did like about the tacos here was that they were medium sized tacos and not your tiny, street taco size. Overall their tacos were good."}
{"text":"Food was good borderline great. ...unfortunately the service ruined it everything was late, the place is called tacos and beer but I didn't have them at the same time why cause the service was horrendous. I would understand if my food came out with so much craftsmanship that it was the cause for the delay but that was not the case...I had to hunt down my waitress to order another beer and then she forgot it. ..I got the two things the place is named after thinking they would be pros clearly disappointed"}
{"text":"30min wait on Tuesday evening, but so worth it! Albert was our server and took care of us as he always does. He's very attentive and on point when making suggestions. Tacos were amazing, and the flan was no different."}
{"text":"A fantastic taco spot lives right off the Las Vegas strip just down the street from Hard Rock Hotel.  Tacos & Beer is a small spot in a strip mall that serves a large variety of differently made style tacos, with plenty of beers on draft, and a great venue.  
I actually live in Austin TX and we have tough standards when it comes to quality tacos.  My friends took me here one time and instantly loved it.  I have made it a mission to visit every single time I am back in Las Vegas.  You can easily take a $8 Uber/Lyft from your hotel room on the strip to go there.  This place stays open past midnight each day.  They have a covered outdoor patio also at the venue.  It is more of a restaurant than a bar, but the venue itself is great.  Not too crowded, well run, friendly staff, and some really tasty food.  
First start the appetizer off which some salsa & chips or maybe even order some guacamole.  The chips are freshly made here. Now you have this huge list of tacos to choose from.  The tacos are mid sized so a normal person will probably want to order 3-4.  The menu has such a great variety to it.  The steak carne asada taco is an easy win with the grilled skirt steak, beans, guacamole, pico and queso fresco.  I love the spicy pork Chorizo taco with cilantro and onion. Certainly enjoyed the chicken tinga taco with verde salsa and pickled red onions.  The BBQ beef taco was just ok, but didn't care much for the bbq sauce.  Loved the fried avocado taco.  Lastly, who doesnt love a basic bean and cheese taco?  Mix and match your taco selection to get the full combo of flavors they offer.  
They serve the tacos on this cool rack that holds each one in place.  Come on Taco Tuesday for $.50 off each.  The bar has plenty of beers on draft and specialty drinks.  Seems Vegas locals also like this spot from chatting with a few different Lyft drivers.  When you are in Vegas, sometimes you just want a simple meal but you still want it to be tasty.  I would much rather pay for the Lyft fare to this spot, get a great meal, then just get another ride back to the strip.  You will realize the cost isnt that much higher than eating in a Vegas strip hotel's basic food court.  This Texan loves Tacos & Beer, and I will keep continue to visit here every time I am in the 702."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and went for it; happy we did. Chose to sit on the patio which is always nice weather permitting. Our group orders guac and chips, tortilla soup and fish taco and beer. All were really good. Fresh guacamole, salty chips, hearty soup and battered fish. We will all definitely be back."}
{"text":"I still like going here but sometimes the service is painfully slow. Also, the fruity margaritas don't always float my boat- I'd rather get a regular one. 

The food is good though! It is usually a good spot to meet friends, location wise and menu/drink wise."}
{"text":"Great simple and inexpensive alternative to strip places to eat! Great selection of authentic and unique tacos AND amazing beer selection. Perfect combo of great food and selecting of brews. Frank, our server, and the entire staff did an excellent job taking care of us. Liked it so much we visited twice in two days."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and a great beer selection! Rotating selection of 20 craft beers on tap! Love it here! Now if they'd just open a location in Henderson...."}
{"text":"Loved it here the first time I even brought friends with me the next! Second time dining here was terrible. Service was horrible, margaritas were too sugary and my tacos were cold. Will not return and will not recommend to my friends or family again. Total let down from this place. Also, they do not provide complimentary chips & salsa like traditional Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! My husband and I stumbled up on this place and it did not
Disappoint! I can't wait to go back this weekend! The margaritas as bomb the tacos are good the atmosphere is great. Great deflection of beer if you are q craft beer drinker! I'm so glad We found this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best spot so far in Vegas for Tacos!!! Came here with a bunch of friends. Be sure to make a reservation for happy hour to get a table. Service was GREAT! You have 1.5 hours for the table for HH but server said if it's not too crowded they'll let you stay for longer if you need it. We did not need the full 1.5hrs. We ordered and were served very quickly. Turn around time must have been like 15 minutes for a table of 7! 

50 cents off all tacos. I ordered 3 tacos and was quite full. 

I ordered the Baja fish, crunchy and al pastor. 

Baja fish 5 stars: crunchy crispy fish with guac and other condiments. Absolutely delicious. 

crunchy 5 stars: this one was my favorite. Crunchy taco with mashed potato on the bottom and ground beef. Mashed potato I thought initially was kind of interesting combination in a taco but ended up being amazing. If you get this taco eat it first so it doesn't get soggy. 

Al Pastor 5 stars: pineapple and pork. Meat was tender and flavor was amazing. This taco was better than taco y taco or tacos el gordo to compare. 

I will definitely be frequenting this place more often! great job all around service and food!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Platter prices would be nice as it adds up rather quickly. Staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"The food is simply amazing! I've had the pleasure of dining at this establishment twice and they never disappoint. The variety and flavored of the tacos are second to none. The Crunchy is awesome especially with the mashed potatoes in if. The beer selection is great and service is fast.. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Overpriced, tortillas aren't fresh or homemade, chips are meh, tacos are hit and miss at best. Three of us ordered different things - same impressions. Beer is good (because not made here?)"}
{"text":"Wow! The best salsa....like...ever!!!  I ordered the chips and salsa appetizer and it came with a red salsa and a green salsa...they were both fantastic!!  Im a salsa snob so for it to be fantastic, it must be.  We also ordered some mules(the drink in the copper cup)  Wow!!  These mules were nothing short of amazing!  The tacos were very tasty and the staff was great!  I'll be bringing friends here when they come to visit!"}
{"text":"Great late night spot for exactly what they advertise, tacos and beer! I would recommend getting their \"crunch taco\" and some of their fresh guac and chips. They have a pretty extensive beer selection and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome tacos... No I am not just buttering their biscuit. They use some seriously fresh ingredients to complete and perfect these amazing creations. The tortillas are handmade (right?!) enough said. Not to mention the amazing employees manning the bar and the unusual selection of beers offered on tap."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Both styles of fish tacos awesome. Lots of unique flavors,  authenticate tasting and presentation was nice. Everyone one that we spoke to there was very friendly. Definitely a must try. Well be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great tacos and margaritas! Service was good and prices were really reasonable. Decor was awesome."}
{"text":"Had dinner at this spot last night as I normally go every Tuesday where there is a Taco Tuesday party! The food is always great. It seems that they changed the liquor/beer vendor because the wine and beer are just not that great anymore. Change back!!! I had some apple cider which was gross & then ordered a moscato which tasted like it had a cork in it. Get those drinks together folks. Shrimp tacos, Baja fish tacos, and guacamole were bomb as usual!!! Service was okay. The busser kept coming by taking plate we weren't done with. That was a little weird but we got it together. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Out of 4 times had a Excellent experience 3 times. The other time was Still GOOD but not excellent.

Tasty Food. Unique selection of 3 hot  sauces.

I like the \"crunchy taco\" -\"guero\" style seasoned ground beef & mashed potato, crunchy shell w/lettuce, pico, sour cream, hot sauce, cheddar cheese



Cheap but not Free. Like $2.50 - $4 per taco. 
1.99 for chips and salsa

Advice: Go with the pitcher of Margarita not by the glass, or beer."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My husband and I tried it last night and it is now are favorite Mexican restaurant. The Carne Asada fries are to die for. Great Service, Nice ambiance - would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This is decent food and a good selection of beer and liquors. I am not a huge fan of the tacos (a little to much going on even with a simple taco, sauces, seasonings) and I don't like the nickel and dime you mentality. It is weird that they charge $2 or something for chips and salsa. Then all the tacos have prices around $2-$3. The point is to sit there with some chips and salsa, scope the menu and drink your first drink. Instead you order, order again, wait and then order again. Seems drawn out. The entire menu is this way as well, which I don't care for. If you want something it costs less than $3 most of the time but two people, two drinks, tacos and 2 appetizers was $50 pre tip, and i wasn't exactly full. I think the format works with their other restaurant (Fire Fly) serving tapas, but with tacos it feels odd with tapas tacos."}
{"text":"This place is great. Awesome beer list and fantastic tacos. Very cool vibe inside too, lots of brick and dark wood. 

Also, the bacon wrapped jalapenos were delightful. It's a little off the strip, but definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This Establishment was highly recommended from my relative as I trust him with cool places to check out off of the Vegas strip. Well he was right on the money for Tacos & Beer. Greeted at the entrance with a friendly smile and seated quickly on a Thursday night. Our waiter was very friendly and provided excellent service all the way through our stay. Since Im a vegetarian, I was worried about my options but the veggie taco just blew me away with the delicious flavors that I ended ordering 2 more tacos.. We also had the chips and salsa which was just as good as we added some of the salsa to our tacos just to kick it up a notch.. The ambiance is perfect for my flavor, very chill with low lighting,, cool background music and nice modern mexican-latin decor.. Tacos & Beer in now a standard for me to stop by when Im in town as I will be checking out the Techno Tuesdays/ house music on Sundays..  Stop in for some chill eats, drinks, and beats..."}
{"text":"Always yummy. Nice cheap place for dinner. Chips and salsa, 2 decent sized tacos and a beer for $11 plus tip. Service is so quick! Was served everything in my meal within 10 minutes of sitting down. Happy Hour is only a deal on the drinks. Tacos are only 50 cents off 3 varieties. Who needs happy hour when the prices are so reasonable. Haven't had a taco here I didn't like."}
{"text":"I was interested in this place after seeing a bunch of yelp buds check into here. It was a very solid experience. 

I guess that this used to be the old Firefly restaurant, with the same owners as Firefly. Instead of a tapas restaurant, they have turned it into an upscale Mexican restaurant.

The interior is dark and moody, giving the place a very relaxed feel where you can just kick back and chill with your buddies.

First ordered the house guacamole. It was nicely made, but I thought it could have used a touch more seasoning. But, I did enjoy that lil kick of heat that they put in it. The chips were super crispy, and not too greasy.

Then, my tacos came out. First, I gotta say, I love the tacos here. They put a lot of attention to the small details. The rock shrimp tacos are bomb. Coated with a slightly spicy (but not too spicy) seasoning, they were cooked to perfection. I would also recommend the crunchy tacos. They actually put mashed potatoes in them! And it works marvelously. The lengua and barbacoa tacos were hits as well.

Ordered some sides as well. The charro beans were just OK. I did like the fresh chicharrones on top though. Also got the hot chilies. I would say to avoid this. It came with just 3 roasted chilies that were cooked with lime juice. I'm sure there are better options on the sides menu that you can choose.

I like this place and would come back here with friends and colleagues. I would also like to try some drinks here next time, they seem to have an interesting program going on there."}
{"text":"Great food. HOWEVER, They have THE WORST SERVICE I have ever experienced. I made a reservation. We had to wave multiple servers down to order drinks and food. It's ridiculous. Whoever one of our servers was looked so irritated with us when we ordered. Just be warned. But the food and drinks are on point...but I prefer service over food."}
{"text":"Really cool little dive. Service was excellent! Queso is pretty good. Might go for the guac next time since the dollop they put on the queso was delicious. I had a traditional margarita which was really good and strong. They have many beers and liquors to choose from. I had a Baja taco and a pork al pastor taco and both were really good. The Baja taco was the best, especially the slaw on top! The fish was freshly fried and piping hot when it got to my table and the fish combined with the slaw and Pico de Gallo was the perfect balance of flavors.  My husband got the lengua, chicken Asada, and BBQ beef and he said all were really good. If your visiting Vegas and are able to get off the strip, I definitely recommend making the drive to this place."}
{"text":"Big quesadilla. Great queso fondido. Lengua taco was okay. Not worth the price. It was good to get cochinita pibil taco which is rare to get in Begas as opposed to LA. It was good. The beer selection is strong too."}
{"text":"Excellent selection. This is a great spot to sit, chat while drinking a beer and watching a game on tv. Food is superb and staff is friendly. Highly recommend the Cheesy Taco with mashed potatoes!  Great selection of craft beers. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I loved the beer battered avocado taco the best. I also liked the beer battered fish taco as well. We decided to try the churros for dessert and they were delicious! The service was great and I would recommend this out of the way place."}
{"text":"The Guacamole is the best I've had - and the tacos are great! They misplaced our ticket - and it took them awhile to get our food. When they did bring it - they told us our meal was taken care of, and not to worry about it. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Killer delicious margaritas. Great atmosphere. 

Worst. Service. Ever. 

Which for me, completely killed it. Don't bother wasting your time."}
{"text":"Happy hour is pretty good here 3 bucks for beer and the puerco tacos are to die for!!! The prices for regular menu aren't that bad either"}
{"text":"Probably the best tacos I ate in my life !! And they really cheap like $3 each!!
The chicken with the mash potato was amazing , the beef  barbacoa is perfect!!!
Will probably visit here every week from now"}
{"text":"Delicious. You have to try the strawberry margaritas. The taco salad was huge way to much for one person. The pork tacos are so flavorful. The guac was def fresh few choices of salsa. The service was amazing the manager was awesome. Sent over free desert the churros are extra sweet but tasty  the bacon wrapped jalapeño really good.  Nothing we ordered was bad can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Tacos and Beer was such a pleasant surprise. We ended up there by accident. We did not think much of it until we got inside. What an original and great atmosphere!!!
Our waiter Frank was amazing. Not only was he super attentive but he had so much charisma and professionalism.

Will definitively return on my next trip to vegas."}
{"text":"I only had 2 dinners in the area and I chose to have them both here. I like good tacos and good beer.  They do both, hence the name.  A wide variety of gourmet tacos and good beer, you can't go wrong.  Nice atmosphere too, friendly staff but they don't over do it. 

Ok not everything is perfect. A couple nachos were saturated and chewy - not crunchy. But who would even verbalize such a minor complaint?  Just grab another chip!  They will bring more!

I would eat here every night if I lived here."}
{"text":"Best taco place & Best Mexican food in Las Vegas ! I have a fav taco spot in la . This is my Vegas go to! 

This place was amazing from start to finish ! 
Got there around 10:50 pm
The happy hour started at 11pm where they have Mexican beers and margaritas on special for 3& 4 dollars.
The shots of patron we got were like 10$ each but big shots worth it with a diet coke back . (Also they refilled my diet coke through out the night it was on the bill
After but they took it off cause I told them it was my backer for my shot) it was a big glass. 
Customer service was great! Waiters are pleasant and attractive. 
The tacos are amazing! all reasonably priced and sized like 3/4$ each . They are speciality tacos and very good not like generic ground beef or something. Each is unique and flavorful 

The spicy shrimp (big shrimps ) n steak taco were my favorite! I will definitely be going back for those. They were spicy and had different amazingly yummy hot sauces to choose from
On each table . I also got mahi mahi taco and ceviché was an amazing appetizer with loads of chilled mahi mahi .
Tip : come during happy hour and your tacos are only
2/3$ and happy hour is 3-6pm
Or 11-2am
The ambience was great! There was live DJ spinning great music, I didn't want to leave.! And it makes it for a good place to have some drinks of course. 

Crowd was classy and attractive. And it is a mexicAn resturant , so there was also a Mexican soccer team
There. It was cool :)

It was pretty dark with green neon lightening . Which I loved added to the night life ambience. 

In summary an amazing Resturant and I will be back! Hope they have a DJ again! It was a Tuesday night when I visited!"}
{"text":"Food is great! Incredible beer selection!! I'll b back for happy hour cause who doesn't love an amazing deal?! The staff was impeccable considering our table was pretty outa control. I felt bad for everyone else but than again, that's Vegas? Outside seating is a plus. Thank you to the staff for putting up with our nonsense."}
{"text":"THE TACOS: Several options to choose from, including 3 vegetarian versions! Unfortunately I found the lengua plain and greasy, but the grilled fish taco was fairly good. Unfortunately it was wrapped in a waxy, store-bought flour tortilla. Prices are a little high, ~$3-4/per with a 50-cent discount on Taco Tuesdays. If you're going to hype up your tacos and price them higher than nearby taquerias, at least buy the good tortillas to use even if you don't make them in house (which isn't that hard).

THE BEER: Sat at the bar for my visit. Selection looks good, but my server/bartender wasn't particularly knowledgeable, friendly, or service-oriented. There were several friendly ladies behind the bar but the one serving patrons seemed to be the least suited for it. She barely made eye contact, didn't engage in any conversation, and didn't seem to want to be there. Perhaps she was having an off day.

THE REST: Interesting setup, lively atmosphere. The surprise hit of the night was the taco salad with grilled chicken, which had a lot of different, fresh ingredients (toasted pumpkin seeds, a tasty cilantro-ranch, some citrus!) and a low price tag. They have some live music events and are really pushing their Nacho House Sundays."}
{"text":"The best of the best it doesn't get any better. Took multiple people here and they all love it! The tacos are amazing, even the beer is great! Always recommend this place if your a fan of good street tacos, 50 cents off tacos on taco tuesdays!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. The tacos are really good and the beers are even better. I even once tried a pretty awesome jalapeno margarita but honestly I would rather drink the beer. Great atmosphere, great patio, always fun."}
{"text":"I had dinner with a friend of mine this past Thursday and we both had a great experience. I ordered my favorite tacos Chile Verde, Raja's con crema, Carnitas and the fried avocado with a side of Jack and Coke, Ha Ha Ha. It was delicious and the service was once more excellent Harry and Franco really know how to take care of there customer. My glass of water and Jack and Coke where never empty. They made us feel truly welcome and offered incredible customer service. This is the reason I keep coming back to Tacos and Beer. There was plenty of parking and choice of setting inside or on the patio. Thank you both for a memorable experience and a delicious dinner. See you all next time."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW. What an atrocious experience I experienced last night. I flew in from NY and I was there with my brother, his girlfriend, and my boyfriend and we came to enjoy some tacos & beer for Taco Tuesday.  We had ordered our tacos and my boyfriend wanted to try the beer sampler my brother had recommended to try. So minutes later we got our guac and tacos and beer sampler. 

I wish we COULD have enjoyed it but.. MINUTES later.. our beer sampler had been SNATCHED from our table from the manager (Chuy Ramos) without us even knowing why. Just gone- disappeared right off of our table. I thought he was going to come back and explain himself--- but NOPE. HE didn't. So in awe that ANYONE in the restaurant business would do that, I called my waitress. First of all, vegas is HUGE on hospitality and taking ANYTHING off anyone's table without first explaining WHY is a NO NO. You just DON'T do that. So back to my story, I spoke to the waitress to call him over because I wanted to know first hand why he took our beer sampler away without any explanation of why. He came over, was rude and DEFENSIVE- NOT apologetic at all. He told me that he thought that our table had no intentions of paying for it.. WHAAT?? How does that even make sense. REGARDLESS- I told him it was inappropriate and unprofessional and rude. His response: \"I DON'T CARE, I DON'T CARE, I DON'T CARE. HAVE A GOODNIGHT!\" .. I WISH I was joking.  Management or the owner should know that this is the kind of manager that is running this restaurant. Needless to say, I won't be returning and neither will anyone of my family members. That is definitely not the Vegas hospitality I was accustomed to.  I'm from Vegas, grew up here, went to UNLV here.. and I have never experienced such rudeness. He should have been apologetic and brought back our beer sampler.. but nope he did not. Just watched us until we finished our food and we left."}
{"text":"Updated review: My wife and I returned for another try and although I initially wanted to give this place a 4star, I feel confident now in giving it a solid 5. We started with the TNB salad, and had a variety of 6 different tacos. We had the BBQ beef, shrimp, grilled fish, pibil, crunchy chicken, and the pastor. The pastor tacos are out of this world good, for sure favorite. I strongly suggest trying a few different ones, and sharing if need be. Looking forward to coming back to try the hurache, which is always a favorite dish of mine when I come across it on a menu.  

I would have totally given this place a 4 star, but the service was really, really sub par. We had the dozen mini taco plate, and two full size pastor tacos, and the bacon wrapped jalapeño peppers. The jalapeños were really tasty, and the pastor tacos were fantastic. The dozen mini taco plate on the other hand, was a bit of a let down. Our server did not indicate to us that the minis are not served as they are described on the front of the menu. They are served with just the meat, cilantro and onions. Not as they are described with specialty toppings that I feel make the tacos unique. So do yourself a favor and order the specific tacos in full size form, they are totally worth it."}
{"text":"This bar is AMAZING!! The whole staff was beyond helpful. They guided us through the beers and tacos to ensure that we had the best experience...ypu guys are lucky to have Katie, Athena, Ben & Brege on your team. I only wish I had this kind of hospitality back home!! 

P.S. Ben has an amazing smile...let him know!! ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Every time I try something new, I am surprised how good it is. My go tos are the peuro verde, crunchy beef, and the rajas con creme. 

Generally busy so get there early or make a reservation. 

Good service. Frank is very attentive"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The atmosphere, the service and damn those tacos are delicious. The shrimp and battered fish tacos are to die for.  Frank was our server and he really was the best. Super friendly and helpful. Thanks Frank! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Good place to eat , tacos are amazing and they have house Tuesday's with a cool atmosphere and a mini dance floor out side with people dancing :) def a plus!!!"}
{"text":"Went there on Tuesday, supposed to be house music night. It was techno Tuesday! But, was pleasantly surprised! The food was off the chain! Best damn Mexican food , I've had in Vegas. From Chicago, so was expecting real house music. Although, music wasn't bad. The food and atmosphere, more than made up for it. Went back , three nights in a row. The staff was great! Armando, the manager, treated us like we were VIP. Thanks for a great time. Can't wait to come back. Check out Sunday night. More like real house music!"}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars because of the food ! The food was AMAZING !!!!!!!!!!!! Of course today is Cinco de Mayo and the restaurant was pretty full but it's a tiny restaurant so I didn't really see a reason to be neglected... our service was completely horrible.. I don't know if she was new or what but she was a beautiful brunette young lady maybe she was just overwhelmed... But we asked a server if she was news she told us no, so I guess there's really no excuses for the service that we got ... I'm not sure but she took FOREVER to give my husband a refill , To take our order, and even just to check on us .. The managers never came over to check on us to see how everything was either .. I mean if you are THAT BUSY you should at least see how everyone is doing .. But I'll go back again it's just I think I want a different server or maybe a different day would work .. The food was just AWESOME .. I had the shrimp taco and beef tongue taco ! Awesome sauce . With a mango Margarita!! I think that they just need a bit more training on how to handle under pressure .."}
{"text":"Because I'm a sucker for fish tacos...

Imperial Tacos & Beer is a bar-like setting if that matters. They have patio seating which was a big plus.

Ordered just simple stuff:

- Baja fish taco, shrimp taco, taco al pastor
- Corn salad
- Chips and guacamole

I'm a minimalist, because the simplest things reveal the true quality easily. They did it so well, in presentation, flavor and finishing touches.

Totally awesome."}
{"text":"Should say Tacos and maybe SOME beers. The server was super nice but almost every beer we ordered were out of stock. Bartenders were slow but at least,  the entertainment for Nacho House Sunday was great. Arroz con Pollo!!"}
{"text":"I'm staying at one of the nearby hotels and got some recommendations to this place. I walk into the bar to order some take out. The Girl at the bar is nice and helpful but the rest of the crew were just walking around aimlessly speaking Spanish to each other which was very rude. The guy that took my order ended up ruining my order twice. I asked for no meat on the nachoes and they put EXTRA meat... I also ordered a bean and cheese taco and he ends up giving me a pork taco...wTH man the guy doesn't even apologize and I left very dissatisfied. What a waist of time and money. . . 
1 star for her! 0 for the rest."}
{"text":"This was just not that good to me. Great service but food was just okay. We had a variety of the tacos, rice and black beans, and some guacamole. I didn't like the chips. Skinny margarita was fine."}
{"text":"The changing menu of delicious craft beers is great. I really like their guacamole, best I've had probably. The service was great at the bar and they usually have sports playing on the two TVs behind the bar. If the game you want to watch isn't on just ask them to change it and they usually will. If I could just make one suggestion - All You Can Eat Tacos -"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Very clean, cool atmosphere. Tacos with mashed potatoes inside? Umm yes. & most delicious margs I've ever had. Service was amazing, which I didn't expect, being most places in Vegas have average service at best. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Hip little joint with some unique spins on your typical taco. The staff are friendly and accommodating, so don't be afraid to ask about modifying something on the menu. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I work about two minutes from this location.  I frequently order lunch.  AT THIS MOMENT I am on infinite hold waiting for someone to take my order.  SOOO Long I decided to write a review and If I can complete this typing than I am going to hang up.  The quality of food has decreased since I started ordering in July.  To bad - it started out so good.  OH Yeah still on hold... FYI"}
{"text":"Love the variety of different tacos. Al Pastor is the best and the TNB salad. Our server Frank, was so kind and on top of everything."}
{"text":"Wow see!  This place is awesome.  Great food, great value.   I highly recommend the Cochinita Pibil taco.   It's packed with flavor that even pork haters will love."}
{"text":"Been coming here as a local for 3 years.  Bach party came into town, 3/4 of us were totally okay to eat.  The other just left his head on the bar to rest for a sec.  denied drinks/ denied table......we asked to speak to a manager, the bartender wouldn't let us.  We dropped $100 the night before with people in worse shape than tonight.   Will NEVER come back!  Bring business there all the time!!  Never again will I eat here or recommend business to this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and fresh tasting tacos. Recommend the peurco Verde.  Taco Tuesday $2 taco s was a great deal. Enjoy good food off the strip."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place , an absolute gem in the heart of Las Vegas. The real deal Holyfield of authentic tacos , but let me tell it doesn't stop there they have hands down theeeee beast tap beer selection off the strip, from the guacamole to Guero taco to Asada tacos will leave you wanting more, handmade tortillas and homemade everything makes you feel like you're in Mexico somewhere, they're always jamming good music, the staff is bilingual meaning the servers provide that extra flavor you won't get at taco hell or any other wannabe taco places. Everything I've had, I've enjoyed and is very very tasty. My favorite Mexican in Vegas hands down for a party in your mouth where all flavors are coming. Nom nom nom nom"}

So, I gave this place another chance since my good friend loves it...and I'm so glad I did! 

This time, hostess was wonderful, server was attentive (enough) and the food was still incredible! I'm so glad this experience made up for the terrible service I had the first time I came here, because the food is just too good! 

One of the owners, Carlos is absolutely wonderful and his beer knowledge is impressive. If you don't have a palate for beer, like me, you should really ask him what to order, if he's around. I was so surprised that I found two beers I LOVE, 1) Tangerine Haze (IPA)  and 2) Elephant Heart Brett. 

It's a fun atmosphere and you should really bring a friend, or two or three and come have some eats and laughs!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Cool little spot just behind the strip that was about a $6 cab ride from the linq. Great service, good beer line up, and delicious tacos! Oh and bacon wrapped jalapeños!"}
{"text":"Above and beyond service from Alberto! I mean, WAY above and beyond starting with our drink orders - he offered samples of each beer we were wanting to try (which ended up to be seven). No problem!
He had a lot of knowledge about the menu items as well.
Celebrating a birthday, so he brought the sample platter, AMAZING! Choco tacos, flan, ice cream, churros, chocolate sauce. Whew!
The food, the cocktails, the service, the vibe = EXCELLENT!
Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a really excellent lunch today - Chips and Salsa were awesome and the tacos were awesome! We were in and out in about 30 minutes which we thought was good but it was not busy at all - the service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting...looked like a dive but Iwas pleasantly suprised. Super fresh tacos. The best tacos my husband and I have ever had and he used to live in Mexico!  I can't pick a favorite, we sampled 5 tacos and they were all great. Each had a unique blend of flavors made with the freshest ingredients. We intended to go to another Taco joint Yayo Taco but found out it was closed. Happened to drive by this place and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad we stopped!"}
{"text":"This place is truly a hit or miss. 
It's a good location. Nice patio.
And usually the food is great!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and as we walked in the front door we were greeted by the greeter and were seated immediately. We started out with the Queso Modelo and ordered our own individual orders. I ordered the Carne Asada taco, barbacoa taco and chorizo taco. We received the queso modelo first and proceeded to absolutely destroy it. We loved it so much we ordered another. Mind you, this is before we received our individual orders. Shortly after we polished off the first order of queso modelo our individual orders came up. My three tacos I ordered came out perfectly. I loved every one of them and they got better and better with every taco I ate. My grandma ordered the fried avocado taco with cilantro dressing and proceeded to destroy it commenting on how it was the best taco she'd ever had. My cousin ordered the carne asada fries and asked me to eat half of it and they were extremely good. We were extremely satisfied with every aspect of this restaurant. Frank, our server made us feel very comfortable he was extremely sociable and kept up on empty drinks before we could finish them. One of the best servers we have ever had the pleasure of being around. He made us feel at home and relaxed. Overall this restaurant is a 5/5. Everything was right throughout the order and we will be returning and recommending to friends. Thank you Tacos and Beer!!"}
{"text":"Stopped on for lunch. 

3 tasty tacos and a ice cold Corona. $22 with a tip. Fair price for delicious food. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great tacos. Chicken tinga, barbacoa, and crunchy with chicken and mashed potatoes were my faves. Salsa also great. However, our margarita pitcher had waaaay too much sour mix. We couldn't drink it."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a weekday lunch with my wife. They managed to make the the formerly Firefly space seem way less pretentious and more welcoming, which is great. I started with a Tahoe Mountain wild pale ale that had a fragrance of grapefruit and a pleasantly hoppy finish. My wife had a Gose which she found too sweet, but I found very tasty. Salsa offerings with the chips and salsa were very fresh tasting. The Queso Modelo on the other hand was bland with a very un appealing texture, in our opinion. On the plus side though, it was a huge serving for an app. 

Entrees were the taco sample with a few more tacos on the side. The stand out had to be the Adobada. So flavorful. Carnitas and Puerco Verde were also very good. I thought the Lengua was somewhat flavorless; all the punch on that taco came from the delicious pickled radishes and salsa on top. 

On the side we tried the Charro beans. They were so good they made me wanna slap my momma! Definitely a must try. 

Service was speedy and attentive. The food came just about as fast as it takes to make a fresh tortilla and make a taco. We will definitely be coming back especially for the happy hour specials."}
{"text":"One of the best taco places in town! Crunchy chicken is one of the best Ive ever had. Juicy chicken, good sauce, and mashed potatoes! Barboca was also delicious, but the shrimp one was just ok. My friends say the lengua and other chicken tacos were also good. Lots of tacos to choose from as well as other items. HH only includes 4 basic tacos and is better for drinks, but taco tuesdays is .50 off all tacos. The passionfruit margarita was super strong, but yummy. Would give 5 stars but server took a long time to take our order after serving our drinks and on the check the HH prices didnt show. When we asked he said \"again?\" Not sure if it was only that day and not to be cynical but I think they dont check before giving it or fix it unless you say something. Besides that he and the bussers were very friendly. Food also comes out fast."}
{"text":"True to its name, this place serves up some mean tacos (and beer). Beer choice is pretty hipster (lots of IPAs and ciders) and they also have margaritas.

Womp Womp I wrote a review"}
{"text":"The name doesn't disappoint. Yes, there are tacos, delicious tacos with the meat eater, vegetarian, and vegan in mind. Beer? Of course and a full bar on top of that. The staff was ever so tentative and knowledgeable about the menu, but who am I kidding just get one of each taco."}
{"text":"Came to check this place out since coming from L.A. and the mecca of tacos needed to see what this place was all about. Tacos were very good. Tried their Asada, chorizo and pastor. All good! Pastor was my fav. Only thing I hoped was for spicier salsa but won't knock them for that, I tend to really like super spicy salsa. Great service and good drinks. I'll need to go back on a night when they are playing music."}
{"text":"Outstanding flavors!  The ceviche and guacamole are worthy starters before you dig into the tacos.  Carne asada and shrimp tacos were delicious, but I bet it's hard to go wrong.  Beer selection rotates, as do wines.  Big variety for the adventurous and some \"safe\" selections as well.  Clear descriptions on a chalkboard to help.

This is as good as I've seen this concept done.  We eat here on every visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"The name says it all. Puerco Pibil was outstanding, but the crispy BBQ beef was beyond enlightening. It would take a plethora or repeat visits to order the same combination twice. Go immediately."}
{"text":"Very good food, service and salsa. Many healthy and unique choices on the menu.  Few places offer habanera hot sauces made daily so if you like spicy, Tacos and Beer is for you. Rachael made the dining experience a pleasure.  Even the cops eat there."}
{"text":"Awesome - food was spot on - cheese dip amazing- beer GREAT - top notch IPA and very reasonably prices
   Five * Vegas spot"}
{"text":"What fabulous customer service. I order from this restaurant all the time and last night I got my order from UberEATS and my chips were missing  I called and spoke with the manager, a really sweet girl, who not only apologized but gave me free churros! When I got upstairs, I noticed something paper clipped to my chip bag...it was a 10$ gift certificate! That my friends, is customer service that is above and beyond! They have a customer for life! Thank you Tacos & Beer!"}
{"text":"Ordered six tacos to go and it took 30 minutes. Got the tacos and they were cold. I took them back and the bartender was rude and argumentative. She said they would remake them and I said I didn't have any more time to wait. She asked for a receipt which she didn't give in the first place. The restaurant wasn't even busy. This was my second time here, it's unlikely that I'll go back."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and get the burrito!!!! Awesome!! I'm here costing from California and it is pretty impressive!!! Everyone in the place is hustling and it's what you like to see as a customer they are doing everything right!! Keep it up"}
{"text":"This place catered a couple of parties for my company and did an OUTSTANDING job.  

The food was decent, and the staff was on time and prompt.  They showed up prepared and made everything SUPER easy.  The queso had to be my favorite.  I still have yet to check out the restaurant in person, but it is on my \"to do\" list.

Thank you Tacos & Beer."}
{"text":"Fun for taco variety. You can downsize to a small bite size version of 12 choices in either 6 or 12 mini taco plates. All fantastic. 

The only negative thing was the price of beer. The most expensive I've seen outside of a sporting venue or concert arena. Paid $12 for a 10 oz. farmhouse ale! 

Worthy stop for tacos & beer choices, hence the name. 20 taps and a bottle selection.

The restaurant name on Yelp says Imperial Tacos & Beer. There is no mention of Imperial here anywhere so it was tough to find at first, especially on Open Table."}
{"text":"Okay this place never disappoints! The food is amazing! And if you're a cocktail and beer kind of person you're going to love it! They have a ton of different beer. And my favorite the margaritas are so good! The tacos aren't you're a average street tacos either they're AMAZING! :)"}
{"text":"I went here on a Thursday night (October 26) for the late night menu/Happy Hour I had heard of while being here before. The treatment of guests at night is substantially different than during the day/lunch hours, which is when I would usually be here. 

I was ignored by the bartender most of the (slow ass) night. Things started badly when I asked for the HH menu, which says a certain set of bottled beers are half off - and that these beers are marked on the menu. It turns out to be a disingenuous menu because none of the bottles are marked. When I asked my bartender about this, she seemed confused, and called over someone else. This man was very unclear. 
Me: \"Which bottles are on happy hour\"
Him: \"oh what kind of beer do you usually like\"
Me: \"I like various beer, but I want to know which bottles are on special\"
Him: \"If you tell me what beer you like, I can get you one similar\"
Me: ...

This went on for a minute until he informed me that they weren't doing bottle specials anymore, and that was an erroneous menu page. This was a bait and switch, pure and simple.

Frustrated with the experience, and just wanting to leave but still waiting for my tacos, I asked for an iced tea, it was served with no ice - just a room temperature brewed tea, and the bartenders/servers couldn't even be reached to try and fix the problem. Finally, although it was HH, I was charged regular menu rates for my clearly HH tacos. I left disgusted with the overall experience. I had two tacos and an iced tea, and want my $9.04 back for the trouble it caused. Tacos were good."}
{"text":"This was my third visit I took my boyfriend because he's never been there and he loved it. He got the burrito added both steak and shrimp to make it a surf and turf burrito I had the tacos I normally get the shrimp tacos which is excellent this time I got the barbecue beef tacos which wasn't that great it was stuff with mashed potatoes and barbecue beef and barbecue sauce put on top the sauces messy and got all over the table and it wasn't that great but I love the place over all and the service is always good!"}
{"text":"We went with a group of 13 and it was the perfect place for our little reunion! The servers were super attentive and nice, the service was efficient and we were all perfectly taken care of. The place was packed and despite that, we had a great experience all around. Key tip here: the best decision of the night was making a reservation because there was quite a wait when we got there for people without one.

The menu of taco items was vast and almost overwhelming, but some of us asked the servers for recommendations and everyone loved their selections. The tacos are large, and one would have sufficed, but I enjoyed trying two different ones just for the heck of it. If I could have tried several more, I would have, they all looked so good!

We got chips and queso as well as chips and salsa and both were delicious.

I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This review is strictly about the happy hour which I have never come for before. Anyhow, it basically sucks because for food there are only 4 tacos and the Rajas tacos is the same price it normally would be which makes no sense of how its \"happy hour\". I wish they had maybe few more happy hour food options. Also I'm surprised they don't serve chips and salsa like most Mexican restaurants, I means it fine but it would be a plus!"}
{"text":"Love it here; best margaritas; food is delicious, live music is awesome and atmosphere is great"}
{"text":"Let's just say....I have something to \"taco\" bout! Starting with Justin's warm smile from my first bite of the crisp yellow corn tortilla chips that were beautifully paired with a red and green guacamole salsa! I scream, Arrribaaa because I was Caliente!!!! No need to continue, let the tacos to the rest of the talking."}
{"text":"Ok so finally gave them a second chance. Wife and I went in late Sunday afternoon and sat at the bar. Almost empty, one guy at the bar and a couple of couples at tables. Football was on a couple of televisions and futbol was on one. The bartender Natalie was a true delight. We both had tacos, me the fish. Surprised at how reasonably priced the food was. The draft beers which I guess rotate often are listed on a giant blackboard by the bar with a description.  We tried a couple of different ones and enjoyed them. My wife order something in a can that I realized later cost ten dollars and since the staff had all of their clothes on that seemed a bit pricey or I could see this being a five. Thanks for the improvements and we will be back."}
{"text":"Tacos and Beer is a cool lil joint with great food and a great tacos.  The decor is hipster mixed with traditional mexican art.  From the wooden Cheech and Chong art carving over the bar to the prayer candles dangling upside down from the ceiling.  The tacos are like traditional street tacos on steriods with a gourmet twist.  They even make their own tortillas fresh in the back. They have a great teauila and mezcal selection and delicious craft cocktails.  Stop on in!"}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life? (Aka. The two years I've lived in Vegas.) As someone who lived less than an hour from the mexican border for the majority of my life, I've searched far and wide for the Mexican restaurant I would call home and this is it. 

The ambience is great. Casual, but could easily be a place to grab drinks with friends/family or be a date night. The service was excellent. Our waitress was very friendly and always made sure our drinks were fresh and the bussers were constantly keeping our table neat. 

Finally, the food. It was so good! They had everything I wanted on the menu. Quest fundido, carne asada fries, any kind of taco you can imagine. (All around $2.50) the value of the food is fantastic. You get high quality, delicious food, for a very reasonable price. Two people can get appetizers, drinks, tacos, and dessert for around $60. That's insane to me. Especially considering their proximity to the strip. 

I know where I'll be whenever I crave Mexican food, which is often. Hint, I'll be here, stuffing my face in an ungodly, unladylike manner. #notashamed"}
{"text":"Tacos & Beer is a definite favorite of mine! And while the tacos are very good the burritos are fantastic! They're really big so be ready to eat. The corn salsa is also excellent. In terms of the tacos they have tons of different types to choose from. Of the about 8 different types I've tried I can't choose a favorite; they're all good! If you like Mexican food for a reasonable price this is a good spot to check out!"}
{"text":"Alan was a wonderful server. The lighting, decor and atmosphere was fun. Everything we ordered turned out fantastic. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is my sisters favorite so she wanted to take me here and I'm indifferent of it it's not amazing but it's not horrible. Taco Tuesday is .50cents off of a taco. I was really interested in the vegetarian options however the ones I tried were WAY to cheesy. I love cheese but these babies were so packed with cheese it wasn't appetizing. The shrimp taco was bleh. Didn't like anything about it. Not the flavor nor the texture. My favorite was the fish taco! It was probably what made this trip decent. I wouldn't personally return for my sake but if my sister wants to go again I would definitely just order the fish taco."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. If you're a chips & salsa lover, you'll love this place. Service is quick,  the food was excellent and they gave me just the right amount of enchiladas to walkout satisfied."}
{"text":"Our uber Driver told us this spot was a hole in the wall type place. We get there and see a dance club type setting in the front and restaurant in the back. We were pleasantly surprised and thought it was pretty funny. Great atmosphere and the vegan pineapple tacos did not disappoint. I will definitely be coming back here on my next trip to Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love tacos and beer !! Everything is finger licking good. I've been coming here since it opened and not only is it good but very affordable highly recommend"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a recommendation from a friend and this place did not disappoint.
Huge selection of beers and an amazing selection of tacos and other food choices.  All delivered with rocket fast service, excellent place we'll be back."}
{"text":"Went to Tacos & Beer tonight with some friends after playing poker at the casino.  It was the best experience.  Manuel, the manager, treated us great!  Service was fast and on point with everything.

We tried a few appetizers and I can't begin to let you all know how good the bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers were!  Off.  The.  CHAIN!!!  Crazy good!  Careful tho, the cheese on the inside gets scalding hot.  The waiter didn't let us know and he absolutely should have because I'm thinking the inside of my mouth is gonna be hurting for a week.  Still tho, good af.  The Queso Fundido was excellent.  

All the tacos were fire.  My faves were the Puerco Verde, Carne Asada, and Cochinita Pibil.  

Desserts were all excellent, but I have to say the my favorite was the caramel flan (I think that's what it was called).  I'm not the biggest flan guy, but I can't tell y'all enough how good this flan was.  Get it.  For real.  Trust me.  I was fighting my friends for it.  

Service was A+ and the manager was the best.  One of the best of any restaurant that I'd ever been to I'd say...and he's been this good on multiple occasions.  Manuel, you're an example of excellent customer service.  My hats off to ya."}
{"text":"This place. You must try. First of all, they have a great beer selection. Tap list had handles from Dogfish head, Mikkeller, 21st Amendment, Almanac...they had about 20. Good selection of saison, ipa, Pilsner, wit. I had a St Somewhere saison and my wife had DFH Romantic Chemistry. Then I found the bottle fridge in the back. They have a bottle list, sure it's nice, but this fridge is like a gold mine. They had a bunch of rare beers/semi-whales including 5 variants of Eclipse, BCBS and one bottle of FW Anniversary Ale that this guy paid (maybe too much) for. It was totally worth it. Now, on to the food....it's delicious thank God. I can justify coming here and spending exorbitant amounts of money on beer bc the tacos are awesome. They have lengua which is my requirement to call yourself a legit taco place, and it is tender, well seasoned and ample portioned served with a nice green sauce. The Puerco Verde is redonkulous, everyone at the table ended up ordering one or a second helping. They also have cochinita pibil, one of my faves, and it was also delicious. They have fish and veggies tacos also. It seems like 4-5 tacos is good if you don't eat sides or apps. We got salsa and it's really good also. And wouldn't you know it they even have good dessert (dammit!). We were so pleased with everything else we threw caution to the wind and tried the desserts, there's only three, churros, choco tacos, and flan. The churros were my favorite, super fresh, crispy/chewy. God now I wanna go back..."}
{"text":"Great drinks had the Passion fruit Cadillac Martini what an amazing cocktail...it carries a heavy punch. Just had an appetizer this time tried the carne asada fries which were great and flavorful. My friend tried the carnitas and crunchy chicken tacos which she gave both 5 stars. Will be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"Our server Justin was a legend among servers. He brings life to this restaurant and gave our party unrivaled hospitality. We will be back just because of this guy. Oh, and tacos were Nicee.he knew the best tacos for recommendation like the pastor"}
{"text":"Tacos: I'd give them 2 stars. They look nice, but the taste doesn't match. The tortilla itself tasted a little old imo. The proteins were subpar (tongue in particular was pretty bad; fish was nothing special). And the combo of flavors didn't do it for me. 

They charge for chips and salsa (altho price isn't that bad... Approx $3). We also got the carne Asada fries, which consisted mainly of fries and some kind of dressing. 

We actually came for the house Sunday event which is advertised to start at 9pm. It hadn't started at 930 and we had to leave for something else, so that was a little disappointing. 

Nevertheless, because they support good music (house Sunday's and techno Tuesday's, I'll up my rating to 3 stars)."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had! The beer menu is diverse enough for a connoisseur; yet, the Margaritas are it's at. Service is 5 star...special thanks to Oscar, Franco and, of course, to the outstanding professionalism of the manager, Carlos. Carlos was especially kind: my Siberian Husky service dog, Bear, whom I trust my life to, was given water and ice and pampered. Any Husky appreciates such treatment in the blazing Mojave to be sure...so all Service Dog handlers, here's your place to go for awesome food and a warm welcome. Excellent value, too!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner & we experienced such great service & great food. You won't regret coming here!"}
{"text":"Coming from a hospitality/culinary background, I am quite picky and I guess spoiled. This place is really fantastic, every time I come here, I am never disappointed. By the way, I am coming tonight again for our company Christmas Dinner."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Everything about it is awesome! I love how small and cute the layout is. When I dine here I usually sit at the bar for quicker bar service because I can't wait to try the new beers. The selection of beer is on point!  I love when Natalie is working, she is the best!  She always has great recommendations & knows her stuff.  
I recommend a Modelo michelada & the BBQ beef taco- it has mashed potatoes on it! It's such a weird and unique combination but it works!"}
{"text":"So good. My friends and I ordered like 14 tacos by the time we left. And their cocktails were really really good. We also ordered the flan and it was on point! We will be visiting again next time we're in Vegas"}
{"text":"The tacos are out of this world. One of the best beer selections I've seen. Most importantly the staff is well-trained, knowledgeable and very friendly. Do yourself a favor and try it."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced and drinks are small and expensive. Food was mediocre, I had the pork enchiladas and the rest of my party had tacos, all 10 of us were unsatisfied with what we got. Thumbs down ...."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The Tacos are delicious, can't get enough of them and the margarita pitcher is a perfect drink to wash it down. Atmosphere is really cool and the service is perfect."}
{"text":"Don't be blindsided and miss this little awesome taco joint, it's in a little plaza in Paradise road. I love their simple name of \"tacos and beer\" and when you walk in this small restaurant, it is filled with great authentic decor and detail. Absolutely stunning interior design for a taco shop. 

Anyway, my boyfriend and I came to Tacos and Beer for Cinco de Mayo! Maybe it wasn't the best idea to come her for the first time on this day just because the service was so slow because of the crowd. But the food and drinks were great! We will definitely be back on a regular day and hopefully it's even better!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! I ventured here on a Friday around 10pm and it was packed! It smelled so yummy and it WAS so yummy. The chips and guac were great and the margarita was perfect. The tacos were so good with the homemade tortillas. I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Every time we come to town, we HAVE to eat here!!! Taco Tuesday is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Went there because of the great reviews. Food was very good. The service was a letdown. We ordered chips and salsa and 2 tacos each. We told the waiter we might like to order more tacos later so he left us a menu. Food was delivered in a timely manner, however, our waiter failed to notice we were out of chips, and never came back to find out if we wanted more tacos (we did). Finally another server asked about our chips and brought us more, meanwhile at the table next to ours, our waiter was serving more chips and asking if they wanted more tacos. He never came back to ask of we wanted another drink until we were ready to leave. Too bad, as we really liked to food."}
{"text":"Color me impressed. I wasn't sure what to think going into this restaurant. But hey, we had a Groupon.

It's located in the same spot as the original Firefly on Paradise. So it's small-ish. And parking can be challenged when this little strip mall is packed. But that said, we had zero issues at 7pm on a Friday night.

We were seated immediately. Though, there was no hostess at the hostess stand. So we did stand around for a few minutes trying to catch someone's eye.

They're repainted it and whatnot, but it's still a similar layout to how Firefly was. Nice decor. Good ambiance.

The waitstaff were attentive and pleasant. Particularly quick to refill drinks and clear plates.

The guacamole was good. Nothing particularly noteworthy. Next time, I'd probably opt for one of their queso options (they have 2!).

The tacos were delicious. It's all a la carte. The tacos range from $2.50 to $3.75 for one taco. And you can mix and match to your heart's content. The Groupon included 6 tacos, so we tried 6 different ones. They even have vegetarian options, which were quite tasty. In fact, my 2 favs were a veggie one and the pork al pastor (good flavor and topped with pineapple). The beef ones were also good choices.

You can then pick various sides. We went for the chorizo and bacon beans and the cilantro rice. Both were full of flavor.

The drink list is actually pretty good. There's some cocktails and wines, but beer (duh!) is the star here. The beer list was pretty lengthy and had some good finds.

All in all, we had a pleasant and tasty dining experience here."}
{"text":"Just got done having lunch here. Food is decent and tasty, but not mind blowing or a \"must have\". However, the service is utterly terrible. Our server poured a bear into a glass partly filled with water (had dried it after being rinsed out, I'm guessing), was rude pretty much every time he asked questions (for example, when he asked if we wanted something to drink, I told him I hadn't yet looked at the menu. He then immediately got annoyed and said \"so, what do you want to drink?\"  Not sure what part of \"I hadn't looked at the menu yet\" he missed). Salsa showed up after we had already eaten a couple of tacos, no explanation of what the salsa were, and when asking us if we wanted anything else, all he did was start to ask the question and before we could say anything (or swallow the food we were eating) he just turned his back and walked away as he finished the question. 

Just a whole host of other small, bad customer service moves which when added up made for a really disappointing experience. Server clearly didn't want to be there and was not interested in anything. Really hope management there gives a bit of a refresher on basic customer service training. Will definitely steer people clear of this place. There are plenty of other Mexican places around with food that's just as good but have far better service."}
{"text":"I am staying at the Residence Inn and was looking for a late lunch. Was contemplating the Sub Shop next door but saw the sign \"Tacos & Beer\" and thought what could be better than that! I was pleased with the blues filled bar and many taps. The menu is simple alacart style and you can mix your order any way you like. Prices are low and the food was off the charts good. Oh did I mention happy hour from 3-6 and 11 to close with $3 Mexican beer, $4 Margaritas and a great selection of tacos for $2 & $3. This is going to be my regular stop for the best tacos around."}
{"text":"Here on business and trying to find places off the strip.  The salsa and chips were wonderful....very cold beer and the best tacos ever. Will be back in November...."}
{"text":"Great mango margaritas, mango fish taco are the best! I tried their salad and it was okay."}
{"text":"What a sweet accident! We happened upon this place while we were desperate for a place to eat a quick dinner. We were seated on the small patio. The tacos are AMAZING!  The Pork al Pastor is great, but the Fish Taco is out of this world! Further, the integrity of the management and wait staff is really commendable. I left a bag with something valuable within on the back of my chair (on the patio)  and didn't notice til I was at the airport. I called the manager, who had it, and I was able to retrieve it without difficulty. And the manager would not take the cash I offered.  If I ever get back to Vegas, I will stop here again. And leave a big tip."}
{"text":"I am so over this place. They cannot get an order correct to save their lives and they are cheap on ingredients. 

Queso Fundido--about a spoonful of cheese and the rest meat and tomatoes.

Chicken Tinga--supposed to have avocado on it (it's a $3 small taco). It has 3 specks of avocado. CHEAP ON INGREDIENTS!!!

Lengua Taco--its supposed to have cilantro but has none on it.

Queso Modelo--I did not order to ugh but half the time do, it doesn't come with chips and it's supposed to. 

I'm over this place. I have given this place so many chances. I will no longer order from here.
GET IT TOGETHER!"}
{"text":"In town for a conference so we stopped in. Nice atmosphere, polite hostess and punctual wait staff.  The beer selection is great and the beer battered avocado tacos was tasty."}
{"text":"I love Tacos and Beer! I usually come here for late night eats or when I'm craving great authentic tacos! We had the steak or carne asada platter and several tacos including the lengua taco which tastes just like my grandma made! Our server was Oscar and he was amazing! Very attentive and knowledgable! You must try the choco taco dessert, it's soo delish!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos in town! Such a convenient location as well right behind the strip. I got the beer battered fish tacos and grilled fish tacos. So much flavor in every bite. I come here every time I visit Vegas and I'm never disappointed with food quality or service. I highly recommend trying out this taco joint!"}
{"text":"Very good tacos and impressive beer menu. The tap list was a little smaller than we expected but was still better than most places. Service was good. Salsa was excellent!!!! Would highly recommend if you're in Vegas and enjoy good food and drink."}
{"text":"Back again.  This time my party consisted of four.  To drink, I tried the Oh, My Darlin', Clement-ine.  Eh, not my favorite... next.  

To eat, in addition to my regular Crunchy Chicken Taco, I tried the BBQ Beef which was a tad too spicy for my taste - I'm sensitive, and the Baja Fish taco.  I'm gonna stick with the Crunchy Chicken."}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour and paid $10 for a shot watered down Patron!  Not good!"}
{"text":"Great service been here 3 times already 2 out of the 3 server Ruy has served and exelent service along with a guy kept checking up on me bringing drinks making sure table was clean his name is Saiid will come for taco tuesday a lot most definetly"}
{"text":"Great place!!  Came here on a recommendation from someone back home in Chicago and I'm glad I listened.  The beer selection was impressive to start with.  The chips and salsa were delicious.  They make their own salsa and we tried 5 different kinds.  They were all delicious.

The tacos were pretty unique and very tasty too.  We had a couple with mashed potatoes in them.  Who woulda thought to put mashed potatoes in tacos but they were delicious.  Make sure you order the corn salad.  My girlfriend asked for the recipe, it was that good.

Our server was quick and attentive.  He was helpful with my beer options as well.  Manuel, the manager, talked with us and was fantastic.

This place is off the strip but if you have the ability to get to it, go.  It was great fresh food and good people running the place.  I'll try to come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I really, really enjoyed this place!  They have a couple of vegan options for tacos and a few more that are vegetarian.  
The veggie taco -potato puree, sautéed mushroom, poblano, onion & cheese w/shaved romaine, cilantro-lime dressing, pico.  MY FAVORITE.  It was the potato puree that made it.
Beer Battered Avocado -beer battered avocado, slaw, cilantro-lime dressing, pico you had me at avocado and I stayed for the cilantro-line dressing! Super tasty.
Veggi Empanada - roasted poblanos, caramelized onions, mushroom, corn, vegan cream cheese, chipotle dressing.  Freaking bomb-tasty goodness.
On top of the hella reasonable prices they also have quite the beer selection...tacos and beer..yeah I should have expected that. But it's not just beer - the cocktail selection included a prickly pear mule that was quite refreshing.  
Our server, Alyssa, was on it!  She knew the menu well and was great with recommendations as well as the 2 minute, 2 bite rule.
Definitely coming back on my next trip to Vegas.  Kinda bummed we don't have one of these in Reno."}
{"text":"This place is super close to my office so I go here frequently for lunch and dinner. They have an excellent beer selection which is good given the name. Their tacos are also awesome along with their house made hot sauces. Favorite tacos are definitely the crunchy and crunchy chicken. They're filled with mashed potatoes! Yeah! Overall the prices are low and this place is an excellent bang for your buck whether for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Recommend by a friend who is local in LV. The beer selection is outstanding, and the bartender, Maria, was awesome (I had just left work and was ready for lunch). Fantastic food, great service!! Some amazing art on the walls, too; grab a drink and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best tacos in Vegas! Great selection of craft beer and the staff is amazing, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been dinning here for the past five years and I considered myself a loyal customer. I have even bought merchandise (techno taco Tuesday shirts) I've taken several friends and family here because I love this place the food is amazing and the servers and bartenders are super friendly But last night 3/6/18 at the t-t-t event Manuel the restaurant manager asked me to leave for an unnecessary reason I have never misbehaved at this place and I'm a very laid-back guy and very friendly for him to humiliate and disrespect me the way he did last night for something so insignificant. it's totally not right and extremely disrespectful to treat a long time  customer the way he did. I will no longer be coming here ever again thanks to Manuel next time please consider hiring someone who is truly professional in managing this place because if he treated me like crap I can imagine how he can treat any other customer."}
{"text":"This is definitely a go to spot for anyone who wants delicious tacos anytime of the day or late at night. They have over 15 tacos options to choose from, more i believe. Favorites would include the baja fish taco and beer battered avocado. Amazing! Guac is also on point!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time in Vegas as an adult and all my boyfriend and I wanted was a late night joint to get a margarita and some chips & salsa. There wasn't really too many good options but this place popped up on Google and that's where we went. Great atmosphere, wonderful staff (Karen was our bartender), just all around friendly people. I had a passion fruit margarita which wasn't that bad. Boyfriend had a regular ol' lime margarita which was really good. The chips y salsa was delicious, especially the green mild. Ended the night with a tequila sangria which amazingly was delicious as well. I'm from the Reno area and would definitely love if we had one in our area. Next time we're in the town, this will be our go to spot for some drinks and salsa. Thanks for the experience guys."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to eat. Just like the name implies, they have amazing tacos and delicious craft brews. I can't say enough about the food, the beer, or the above and beyond service we received. Delicious, delightful, and dying to go back! Armando and Manuel went beyond the call of duty with their service. When in Vegas...don't miss Tacos and Beer! #TacosAndBeerOP #TacoTuesday #CraftBeer"}
{"text":"Hate to give lack luster reviews but ya. Something is wrong in taco town. 

We went on a tuesday. Had to wait a little bit for a table not to long. Lil disappointing the hotesses did not have control of the wait list and was not doing anything about large parties sitting at dirty tables & seating themselves ( huge turn off to fellow f&b ) We had a small wait and needed a 3 seater so its trivial. We get seated grab some appetizers. Salsas where good. Chips where gross though. I dont know if they are house made? Cold, bland and hard. Ive had better chips from the grocery. Tacos where just ok. We each ordered 2 each Beef, pork , fish and chicken. Was not impressed in an understatement. Size and portion was nice , dressed nice. Flavor bland and dare I say old. We had leftovers a rarity with these guys. I went to eat them the next day and just felt they where gross, eneded up tossing it. 
Servers are nice , host was nice , bar was nice. Beer menu chalk board and numbers to order are awesome and worked well for us. We loved almost all the beers. The fruit beer no one enjoyed but hey you didnt brew the beer. 
Techno tuesday was fun. A techno tent with lights & some music outside. We enjoyed the photo booth and the couple selling natural wraps outside. 
Idk thought maybe they where just having an off night. Seems more like via the other reviews they are having a hard time with quality control."}
{"text":"I've been back three times but no longer sit at the bar. Every business meeting I have here, impresses my guests. Great beer selection and the tacos are excellent. 

Service is great as is the food. But Ms attitude still rules at the bar.  I avoid her. Bad energy. Karma's a bitch."}
{"text":"Saw the name and it sounded good. Had no idea what to expect. When our server offered a topping of pomegranate seed, pumpkin seed, and something else on top of our gauc and chips we were a little taken back but decided to go for pomegranate. The guac was super fresh, cold, and the seeds worked well with it actually. I could have made a meal on that. The beers are really good. Pretty decent menu for beer/cocktails. Our server was good for suggestions. 

So the tacos, WOW. I had, a shrimp, Baja fish, beef soaked in beer, and an al pastor. Shrimp was my least favorite but still good if you love shrimp. Fish was really good! Not too fishy, perfect fried crunch, the beef was super flavorful, and the al pastor was bomb. I tried my buddy's poblano pepper taco...AMAZING. Not too hot, but cheesy delicious. Looking forward to coming back for more!"}
{"text":"My hotel was next door and I visited everyday of my 3 day stay. Each day I tried four different tacos and I must say I was never disappointed plus I love the fact that the tortillas are handmade and fresh. I also love the fact that they offered more than the traditional beef, chicken and pork tacos. There was also a variety of vegan offerings. I will definitely be visiting them again on my next trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"Great tacos (I recommend the 'crunchy') very nice beer selection. I was surprised and pleased...from the plain jane name was expecting a dive bar."}
{"text":"Imperial House of Tacos & Beer is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. They are located in a strip mall across from Gordon Biersch. Parking tends to be a ridiculous situation, and it's not uncommon to have to park across the way near the thai restaurant. Once you do get parked, you have to now wait for seating. They sometimes do and sometimes don't take reservations, depending on who you talk to on the phone that day. It's always crowded and we usually have to stand by the bar with some beers before we do get seated. Once you finally get seated, however, that's when the magic starts. They have amazing Margaritas to start with, and their chips and salsa and guac are delicious. Finally, you get to the tacos, where they have both great vegetarian options and amazing meat options. My go-to tacos are usually cochinita pibil, Baja fish, and Al Pastor. However, with the amount of times I've been, I've heard about or tried almost every taco on the menu, and there have never been complaints. If you want a more local bite of Vegas, go 2 blocks off the strip and check the place out! 

PS: GO ON TUESDAY FOR TECHNO TUESDAY."}
{"text":"I really like the décor of the place and the waitresses and hostesses are cute which does add something to a place but when I go to a place called tacos and beer, I want some good tacos and beer.  The tacos were good, don't get me wrong but all of these people's reviews saying they are the best in town are kidding themselves.  I love the variety and even love that they have so many vegan options (even though I am a staunch meat eater).  I love the variety of unique appetizers but the flavor seemed to be lacking on everything and I made sure to try a lot.  I had 6 different tacos and 2 appetizers and a passion fruit margarita which seemed so fake tasting, way too sugary.  

I would go back and try this place again but probably not for a bit.  I feel like there of plenty of other places that you can have a better taco at in the valley.  Maybe the atmosphere won't be as nice but it will be cheaper and tastier.  

I was so full though after eating all of that that I unfortunately did not get to try their desserts which I REALLY wanted to try.  I guess that gives me an excuse to go back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites from the decor to the taco options I love this place , def start my meal off with a michilada and the quacamole with pumpkin seeds and pomegranate . For me the simple tacos are my favorite , been and cheese is probably on my top list ; but def try all of them if you can , 3 tacos usually fills you up . Enjoy the place one of the best in Vegas ."}
{"text":"Love this spot. Great beer and food!! Extensive list of home brewed beers. I try something new every time I go here and it never fails to satisfy."}
{"text":"Tacos were great and the menu for drinks was written out nicely.  Alberto who was our server gave us some great recommendations.  They also were great with our little kids about altering food for them."}
{"text":"I officially love this place  the guacamole is a must-do but don't go cheap and skip the salsa. Their green salsa is so yum! I've been getting shrimp tacos. The kids quesadilla is delicious and the ceviche was also great."}
{"text":"Wow! Beer & Tacos is a great place to eat. Service was fast, food was tasty. The ambiance, food, and service made the perfect dining experience trifecta. If I lived in Vegas this would be one of my go-to places to eat. Will definitely be eating here next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This is the best place in Vegas for craft beer and tacos. Both are on point, highly varied and unique, affordable, and most importantly, freaking delicious! The staff is great and the GM is a fellow beer enthusiast, super knowledgeable and all around nice guy. They do various tap takeovers with awesome breweries and are hooked up with amazing places so you'll always have an awesome selection of beers. Their selection blew me away for sure! This will forever be a place I visit each time I go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ordered a frozen strawberry margarita for $9. The glass was so small! I can't believe they charged that price. I could have gone anywhere else and got a regular size margarita for that price. It looked like a little tumbler glass. My husband ordered tacos and the tortillas weren't good at all. He also ordered nopales, which the waitress didn't put in when we ordered.by the time he received it, he was finished with his tacos and we were leaving so we sent them back. The only thing good was the tortilla soup. Never going back. What a waste of $55."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars no question. The decor and atmosphere was awesome, not too dark of lighting and awesome music. Lana del Rey,  Mazzy star,  u get it... My husband and I ordered 2 pastor, 2 bbq beef, Barbacoa,  Puerco Verde, and for an app got the bacon wrapped jalapeño poppers. The service was impeccable.  Everything came in a timely manner and the Margheritas were amazing and they have an awesome happy hour menu! We will be coming back and referring our friends! Thank you."}
{"text":"Tacos are very good and inexpensive. Can always order more when you eat what you ordered after you realize how good they were. Variety of beer with a variety of prices. Cute place. Friendly employees. Always seem to be ample parking. Great place to take visitors. Can even order food to go then run in and pick it up. Just check the bag before you leave because I had issues on the only two orders I did this way, so just double check. Will continue to go back because I like the food."}
{"text":"Love this place! The crunchy chicken tacos are my favorite - they have mashed potatoes in them!! They do tend to be on the slower-side of things in terms of service so give yourself enough time to sit and wait/enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"I'm a firm believer that the best tacos come from trucks park outside of bars at 3am or in front of tire stores/mechanics/job sites or in little taquerias  tucked into strip malls. So when i heard that this hip little place that used to be Firefly was slinging some seriously good grub, i had to check it out. I was NOT disappointed! This place is fantastic. I've only ever sat at the bar, and only ever ate the tacos, but i've heard everything on the menu is dynamite, but my main obsession is the al pastor and the puerco verde (topped with chicharron), but the fish tacos or to die for, and the chicken tinga is simple and delicious.  I highly recommend this groovy little spot, especially for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Asada and the Mahi Mahi Grilled Tacos, and while just about any taco is a good taco in my book, these were solid.."}
{"text":"Great tacos. Had the al pastor and crunchy chicken and a pork taco with chicharrones.  The beer selection is quite good for Vegas although the beer prices are pretty steep. Great service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Frank is Awesome!!!! He'll bring you uno mas of anything you want!! And trust me... you'll want more!!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Let's start with starters! Chips and salsa are 1.99! Not cool! Food was mediocre  at best!! $40 for two people for lunch is ridicules. No lunch specials! Place was half empty and service was horrible!! Lemonade was watered down! Would never go back! I'm a regular at Lindo Michochan and taco taco so I may be bias but this place doesn't even come close to those places!! How this place has 4 stars is beyond me!!! Horrible!!"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with a name like Tacos and Beer? I was presently surprised with great food. We had the guacamole which was outstanding, bacon wrapped jalapeños, beer queso, and then awesome super flavorful tacos. I recommend the Baja fish and Al Pastor."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated, cozy dining room. Our first impression was a waiter who seemed nice but spoke so softly we could not hear a word he said amidst the loud room. We started with chips and guacamole - this was good although I've had better guacamole elsewhere. Our margaritas were solid although also not necessarily anything to write home about. For my entree I had the enchiladas which were really delicious with very fresh ingredients. It is worth noting the prices are very reasonable especially for the Vegas Strip area. Overall, great food and recommended although I wouldn't say this is a must visit if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"The service here is above and beyond. Alyssa went out of her way to grab the bartender to give us a review on all of their cider selections since they were out of the ones we normally drink. The food was amazing! Happy hour was great, the ambiance was relaxing and welcoming. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to using a groupon deal, and was happy I did! We dined on a Sunday evening, and I made a reservation, but would have had no problems just walking in to be seated. 

The decor is really fun, I love the lights. Our server was super friendly and made some good suggestions. I had a house margarita with salted foam, which was good. I also had a mango margarita which was also good and not too sweet.

We ordered guacamole, and added bacon since they were out of pomegranate seeds. It was okay, I've had better but I've definitely had worse. 

We ordered a variety of tacos - our Groupon included 6 tacos, 2 sides, and the guac. For our sides we shared a cilantro rice, and the corn salad (street corn, off the cob).

Flavors were great, but the tacos were cold from the toppings/sauces. The corn salad was also served cold, and I would have preferred it to be hot, or at least room temperature. Overall it was a good experience, the temperature variance of the food was kind of a bummer, but I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Alright, so ive been looking for for a Mexican place since ive moved to vegas. While this may not be a \"traditional\" Mexican restaurant, their tacos are amazing and come in a variety of flavors! I got the barbacoa and the carne,  while my buddy got a crunchy taco with ... Ready... Mashed potato enjoyed the hell out of them. Good selection of drafts and Mexican beers and Natalie serves a wicked marg without that nasty jose cuervo mix, be sure to say hey. Goood joint!!!"}
{"text":"Giving three stars because it's a local spot that has great wait staff, a good vibe and good selection of beer and cocktails. Food is meh but I like that you can order to fit your appetite. Started with salsa and chips. Do not order this. Bagged chips from the supermarket with \"fresh\" salsa that tasted like ketchup. Also had the crunchy chicken, carne asada, and barbacoa Tacos. The carne asada was the best, really good. The barbacoa had some sort of BBQ sauce on it, like Hunt's brand. Not good. Crunchy chicken taco was just ok, nothing special. There are a wide variety of tacos on the menu, this was my experience with three. If you want a good local spot that doesn't have the tourist crowd from the strip, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Visited the old firefly joint about two days ago and I was very disappointed.

Lackluster place with no zest to it, place is always empty and it feels like there's only 5 tables in the whole place.

They need to improve the vibe for this joint, there is no appeal for customers to visit this place.

Salsas are stale, tacos are not good and they're expensive. 

The only good thing is the beer selection which doesn't make out for the fact that you will get bad service and bad food.

Overall I would visit several other taco places before you go and take a look at this dump. There's a great variety of places in town that kill this place.

Avoid at all costs!!!!"}
{"text":"Tacos & Beer is such a cute hipster place! We stumbled upon this place because we were craving tacos....and BEER! 

Cute place for sure. On paradise by musashi sushi place and satay Thai lounge. We started off by ordering the ceviche appetizer. I ordered a super must have stout called the fruit beer. Tastes like Chocolate covered strawberries!!! Super on point. My boyfriend ordered the oxhata beer that tastes like horchata! Not my cup of tea because I'd rather have horchata the milky version, but what the heck right? Our \"entree\" meal, I ordered the carne asada taco, bbq barbacoa, and the crunchy taco. All three were so good, but I would have to say the bbq barbacoa is my favorite out of the three. My bf ordered the half dozen baby tacos which you can customize with your choice of meat! And a side of their charro beans! That was so good btw...it's one of their signature sides I believe.

I wish we came during happy hour! I would have definitely gotten more of the bbq barbacoa taco which is by the way...on the happy hour menu! Each taco varies from $2.95-3.95 depending on which one you order. All in all...great food!!! Just wished the prices on the drinks were a bit more reasonable. Would have to come back during happy hour."}
{"text":"This place is so lame that they make you wait almost an hour to be seated for the regrettable opportunity to try their small, dry, tasteless tacos. Not a very good try to become relevant, keep paying your shills to leave you good reviews, I got food poisoning at Roberto's tacos and I'll rate it a higher star any day. Make sure you know Spanish if you want your sever to understand your order. Probably the best tip for this failing eatery!"}
{"text":"Good tacos and great service.  If you wanna get off the strip and enjoy some chill atmosphere and some good food check it out."}
{"text":"Burrito was good they charge you for tip without telling you and they charge you for chips and salads without telling you as well. We told them we were in a rush and they said they will do everything quick it took over an hour."}
{"text":"Don't order the secret Habanero salsa as it isn't secret anymore and it is laced with pineapple and isn't hot anymore, and it isn't free - it's $1.00. 

If you need heat, use the 'hot!' free bottled salsa which is homemade and way hotter anyway.

Still good. $2 Taco Tuesdays is still a deal!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm home in Vegas I always make a point to stop in to Tacos and Beer. You can't beat the quality or the prices. Taco Tuesdays are extra fun, and they usually have discounted food and a DJ. I always send my friends here whenever they travel to Vegas. Took the time to finally write a review because Frank, our server, did a fantastic job of keeping the entire family entertained today. Star service. Will be requesting him the next time we visit. 

Seriously. Eat here. I'm from here. The food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Great tacos, good restaurant.  This is a Mexican style restaurant much like you would expect.  They boast a large beer selection.  They offer chips and salsa, guacamole, and more.  The service is good.  But the Tacos are original and excellent.  Go for the tacos,"}
{"text":"On the top of my list when it comes to tacos in Vegas. Came here for HH and they have several tacos for $2.50. Definitely exceeded my expectations. I thought I had found my favorite spot (cough... in Henderson) but Tacos & Beer takes the trophy. Their meat is flavorful and not reliant on the sauce/add-ons. EVERY taco I had was delicious and can't wait to eat there again. Service was also great."}
{"text":"great tacos. very impressed! I had a trio, Carne Asada, Shrimp and Bahamas fish. the limes were very juicy.  I would have given a 4 star but the Michelada SUCKED!"}
{"text":"Best Gourmet Tacos I've ever had!! Cochinita and puerco verde with chicharrón are two of my favorites! The atmosphere and decoration of the venue are very welcoming and not to mention every time we go they treat us like family, from the wait staff to management. If you're into craft beer they have some of the best selection in town and they're constantly rotating."}
{"text":"Thank you so much to Hank for inviting us back!! Food was fabulous but even better was the service from the time we walked in till the time we walked out! Kaley was excellent & earned herself some new regulars!! Definitely stepped their game up! Thank you Jaime, Hank & Kaley! We'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Came here thinking we've been here before...not sure if it's the same place, but it was very good.  And it's taco Tuesday!  What could be better!"}
{"text":"My husband had scouted this place out and we remember it as \"the old Firefly\". One thing that reels us in is Happy Hour - and a late one at that. The late night Happy Hour is especially great because it's a great pitstop after being on the Strip. It's 11-2 AM every day. 

The food is amazing. I find it to have flavors way better than any other taco I have ever tasted. The service was also great - your drinks and water are always getting filled and multiple people come by to check on you. The tacos are $2 each and we tried most all of them on the Happy Hour Menu. 

We especially loved the Al Pastor and Puerco Verde tacos. The Al Pastor has pineapple in it and that's what gives it such a bright and great taste. They also give you a starter plate of chips and salsa - also very fresh tasting.

We went back to the restaurant a few days later during their afternoon Happy Hour from 3-6 PM daily and again, it was equally as good, both food and service. We were checked on multiple times and never had to ask for anything. 

The very next day, we told our friend that we had to take them to try Happy Hour. So yes, three times in one week. I am happy to say that we are so far 3 out of 3 in food and service. Amazing all the way around and I can't wait to go back. It's refreshing to have a Happy Hour that has really really good menu items at such a reasonable price. Three tacos and I'm full - at most four tacos. 

The last time I was there - also tried the Churros. Delish!!!"}
{"text":"Aside from saving me from my 24/7 coworker presence at the conference center (Thanks, btw!), this place is absolutely perfect. Great selection of eclectic American/Canadian beers on tap (seasonal, regional, funky), and crazy good gastro-pubby tacos and sides. Sweet vibe and rockin early 2000s indie rock...perfect for alone time lunch or conversation. Thanks for actually saving my sanity, Tacos&Beer! Great service, too!"}
{"text":"Tacos & Beer has a solid selection of craft beers and a good variety of tacos along with different entrees like the Taco salad or the green chicken enchiladas. You can order the tacos individual and they pair up well with a cup of tortilla soup which is delicious. The chips and salsa are not free. I'm sure they make a killing charging for 20 tortilla chips and a few tables spoons of salsa! People still order them though including myself lol . 
The place is decorated nicely it has a modern Mexican hipster vibe to it and the lady making the fresh tortillas in the corner adds an extra little spice to the place."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night for Techno Taco Tuesdays. Their complimentary chips and salsa were good. Their salsa is not spicy. It's the slushy, mild kind. Their tacos were $2 that night. Their tacos normally are $3-$4 each. I already had an early dinner so only got two tacos- beef adobada and the veggie potato cheese taco. The tacos are small.

They have a very impressive craft beer selection. However, they need to know their beers. My husband ordered an IPA and one of the Belgian beers for the second round. The second beer tasted exactly like the first beer. When we asked the waiter, he said it was the right order. Uh, OK? My friend ordered an amber ale but they gave him one of the IPAs.

I came here again the following week. The second time here, they forgot my friend's taco. No biggie, it happens. I got the carne asada and the veggie taco since I liked that one the last time. Carne asada was OK. Not bad or the best.

I would come back during HH and please make sure you give people the right beer please!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed catching up with friends here at tacos and beer. Their happy hour offers delicious food. I LOVE their ice cream taco dessert. My favorite appetizer was the bacon wrapped jalapeños. Service was great! They were pretty busy tonight and the hostess sat us immediately. Our server Armando was very attentive and suggested we try the J.K. Hard Farmhouse Summer Hard cider. It is now my new favorie drink. He even took special care while serving our drinks and always checked up on us to see how we were doing. All the staff is attentive and friendly. Ovrall great serice great food great place! I will definitely come back soon with my husband!"}
{"text":"This place is so hyped up and it isn't even good, at all. I tried three different tacos; the fish taco, the beef barbacoa, and the jack fruit. The whole experience sucked. The customer service was lukewarm and it was more about getting you to buy as much product as possible instead of giving you a good experience. The jack fruit was the best out of all three tacos but ultimately it was WET, just like the other taco I had that stained my shirt. The establishment is just filled with snobby people who think tacos are on trend. I was really disappointed by everything this place had to offer. Save your money and go to Tacos El Gordo, better tacos and they're authentic."}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was terrific and the atmosphere was nice too. We went early, as we had 2 toddlers with us, to which the staff was super accommodating. According to my daughter the Lengua tacos were the best. The craft beer selection was enormous,  we will have to go back and spend more time tasting the yummy brews."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Especially when you go for happy hour and Techno Taco Tuesdays. 
The staff is always on top of their game and the tacos are so fantastic. The only downfall to that is it pretty much ruined other taco places for me! 
Worth the drive."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to spots for tacos in Las Vegas. The location is great for locals and tourist. If you're craving tacos, you need to try this place! I'm not much of a beer drinking but the selection from what I've heard from my friends is pretty good. Ben is the best server there! As for his section if you want to have the best experience."}
{"text":"Killer tacos.  Quite possibly the best carne asada tacos I've ever had.  Great beer selection.  Friendly, helpful staff.  Techno on Tuesday nights.  Need I say more?  

Now I'm hungry for tacos..."}
{"text":"Outstanding Food, Beer and Service here!
Great Tacos, Cerviche,
Fish and Shrimp Tacos.."}
{"text":"Pretty hard to find better tacos and margaritas anywhere near the Strip. This place rivals some of the better tacos places in California and the price is half what you would pay here. It has become a \"must\" on our list of places to stop in Vegas."}
{"text":"First time here, service was decent but price wise, RIDICULOUS!!! Literally paid $50 for 3 tacos and 2 drinks. The tacos were pretty good and the drinks were strong but honestly not $50 great!"}
{"text":"Unimpressive to say the least. My wife and I came here for a late lunch and found everything underwhelming. The service was slow, chips and salsa was generic store bought stuff, the ceviche was all lime and came with stale tostadas. And to top it off the tacos were bland and kind of cold. The only positives were the busser who was on top of his tasks and a solid beer selection. Would not recommend and will not be back."}
{"text":"Really loved it, tacos were amazing and great beer selection.  Clean and good service.  Surprised they aren't busier on Saturday lunch but I think they are just starting to be known."}
{"text":"Food was good. Paid way too much for the small Guacamole but it was tasty. 
However the service sucked. Slow, slow, slow. And got my order wrong. 
Not good.
Had to get my own bill paid too!
Just not good."}
{"text":"Pretty stinking good tacos, mis amigos. I've heard that this fun, little taco joint is owned by the same owner as Firefly (located a hop, skip and a jump down Paradise), one of our absolute favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Why would we expect any less quality and amazing-ness from Imperial? This place absolutely exceeded our expectations.

The tacos were very thoughtfully crafted with some lovely, complementary ingredients. We tried a wide variety of their signature tacos and I don't see any reason to stray into the other entree options. The cochinita pibil taco was the only land creature I ate that day and it had intensely good flavor; I especially loved the habanero marinated onions. The grilled fish taco didn't blow me away, but was definitely solid. I loved the fried fish taco, but felt the shrimp taco was probably the winner of the day. Family said the puerco verde was a winner, as was the guacamole appetizer we had to start with.

Their tap selection was great and we were able to buy some IPAs for the table. However, I always forget how expensive Vegas is (we aren't residents) and couldn't believe paying $8-10 for a pint of craft beer. Fortunately, we came during happy hour and were able to quench our thirst with some $3 Negra Modelo on draft.

Finally, we had to get dessert. Their version of choco tacos and churros were awesome and expertly crafted, but the gold medal goes to the churros with their chocolate y whipped cream dips.

EAT TACOS AT IMPERIAL AND BECOME AUTENTICO YOURSELF!"}
{"text":"Let's start by saying the food is pretty good and the bartenders are nice, but the hostesses are rude. I asked the hostess for a table and she asked me, \"Did you already order at the bar?\", and I respond yes. She told me that she couldn't give me a table because the server would get mad! I asked why and she said, \"Because you've already ordered at the bar.\".  I asked why this was a problem and she said that the servers lose money whenever you order at the bar. So apparently I'm not allowed to sit at a table because the server might not like it. The hostess noticed that I was getting upset and she said she would give me a table, but if she needed it to seat someone else I would have to take my food and move to the bar. I told her that's fine because at that time the restaurant was getting empty and a lot of tables were getting clear.  My server must have assumed I wasn't going to tip him because he brought me water and never returned to take my order. I ended up ordering food at the bar. I finished and tipped the bartender for being so helpful, and also my server even though he was useless. Maybe the managers need to watch their servers and hostesses more closely."}
{"text":"I love this place! We came here while visiting Vegas. Amazing food and atmosphere! Great service as well!  A few weeks ago we met Manuel, one of the managers and he's great. He is always running around the floor making sure his customers and staff are doing well. I work at a restaurant myself and I notice these little things. Keep up the good work Tacos & Beer!"}
{"text":"Went after a recommendation from a friend Large selection of fair prices tacos. We had crispy chickens, carnitas and I forgot the third. Carne Asada fries had a lot of toppings. Too bad the chips & salsa aren't complimentary."}
{"text":"First off, I noticed the originality of the concept. A funny image of the famous Mary mother of God with a Taco on her heart is only one of the many beautiful displays. Next, the customer service is tremendous. My friend and I waited for our group to show up and the waitress constantly checked up on us politely and asked if we wanted to start off with an appetizer while waiting. And finally, the tacos. Wide variety. Unique flavors. I'll definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fancy yet chill night."}
{"text":"I never in my life thought I would eat here after the Firefly disaster, but I have to give it to the owners, you have made a comeback. I have tried the chicken, the fish, the shrimp, and the pork, and liked them all. Chips and salsa- BOMB. Corn salad, 6 stars. Even the cilantro rice was impressive. 
Want to know my only complaint? $3.50 for an overstuffed street taco is not ok, ever. $20 for me to have lunch alone, $35 for a Togo order for 2 people to have tacos? Seems a little outrageous to me. 
However, if I like your food I am willing to spend the money, because I keep returning. And have no intentions of stopping anytime soon. 
I actually want tacos as I write this. 
The décor is semi day of the dead type. The service was great. The food, well I have yet to try something I do not like. 
I expected less from this place. It's nice to have a place exceed your desires. 
But there is always going to be that little voice in the back of my head saying, \"I hope this doesn't get me sick\". Maybe I am harsh, and I should have more love for the Vegas natives such as myself. I consider it realistic. 
Please don't let me down! 
Next time, I plan on trying the enchiladas. I will keep you posted."}
{"text":"My favorite place to come to for tacos! They are so flavorful! What I really love is their variety of tacos and their vegetarian options. You'll love them even if you're not vegetarian! They're micheladas are also to die for, taste so authentic! Always finish off w the churros for dessert. It's a big portion, one is enough for the table! I always request Oscar as our server but everyone else is great too"}
{"text":"Great selection of tacos. Got the asada for my oldest son he loved them. The crunchy \"gusto style\" ones my lil one devoured them! Theyre big hearty tacos lots of meat and toppings. Fresh! I got the grilled mahi tacos and it was pretty good as well. Shrimp cocktail had good flavor and lots of shrimp. They add orange segments which is diff BUT their cocktail juice is delish not too spicy not too sweet. Will be back!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and surprisingly it was good. It's a tiny restaurant but the service was quick. The food was delicious I had a shrimp taco and Baja fish taco. We also ordered guacamole with salsa. Their dessert is so good we ordered a coconut flan at the end of our meal which was amazingly good! Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I love this spot. Fantastic tacos and great cocktail/beer selection.  It is so easy to get carried away in this restaurant.  The dim lighting and enclosed areas take you away from the rest of the world.

So many taco options and the vegan tacos are great even if you're not vegan. Dangerously good cocktails. Pace yourself or you can be in trouble.

Not much more to say....just trust me and wander off the strip to find this place next time you're in Vegas. 

(Oh, and order one of the vegan tacos...while ordering flautas, bacon wrapped jalapeño poppers and cochinita pibil and chorizo tacos. Cuz that makes sense.)"}
{"text":"Fun place, interesting taco menu and great beer selection.  Nice to have places to eat on Paradise that aren't in the casino"}
{"text":"Really please with the food here. Had the crunchy 'guero' taco which was amazingly rich and delicious. Also had the pollo asado taco and carne asada fries which were both very tasty. They also have a little corn salad appetizer that was very unique and also super tasty. 

The prices are not bad at all- just go in expecting restaurant prices and not taco truck prices.  Lol 

Waiter was so nice and explained everything i was curious about. Wish i had caught his name. 

Overall great experience!!"}
{"text":"Had a dozen street tacos which included barbacoa, carnitas,chicken, veggie(mushrooms) & bean and  cheese. All of which were mighty delicious. Along with freshly made guacamole. Guacamole was fantastic! Margarita pitcher worth it! Ordered a side of muddled jalapenos to add to the traditional Margarita, makes it pop! Service was OUTSTANDING! Especially for how busy it was. Beer selection is super! Best dessert ever and a must have every time: CHOCO TACOS! BOMBNESS! Exited to come back here and try full size tacos and ceviche. Thank you to all staff and management."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Took a while to get our food but when we did... It was so good. I got the Baja fish, crunchy, and dorado tacos and a house margarita on the rocks. They were on point, and the margarita definitely had a kick to it. I had to order another Baja fish taco because it was so good. Everything tasted super fresh! I would definitely recommend this place. They have great food and a fun atmosphere. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"OMG!  The tacos were amazing and the beer selection was huge!  Alberto helped me pick a new beer that I'd like.  Service was amazingly fast, food was great.  Everyone there was friendly- could not have asked for a better experience.  Will definetly go back again next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular; no questions about it. The a la carte taco selection is superbly gourmet and no selection from it will leave you disappointed. 11/10, would leave my wife to marry Tacos & Beer if it were a lady."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in town! I come here maybe twice or three times a month. The service is always great! Delicious tacos, quesadillas, the Michelada mix...everything bomb! But today's service was exceptional, the server Frank took great care of us...very attentive and brought out everything we had asked for with a wonderful attitude. We also happened to leave our credit card and he ran out to return it to us! Thanks Frank! #tacosandbeer"}
{"text":"Meh. Tacos weren't that great and over priced (except for being in Vegas) our served was nice & let us make changes to the tacos to satisfy our picky tastes :) you could definitely taste the tequila in our margarita which I guess is a good thing for some. Chips and salsa not included. Small salsa cups and extra if you need more. I also was not a fan of the queso. Had to change my star rating the more i think about it. Good service but overall 3/4 of us in the party did not care for our food which is surprising in a group of people who love tacos!"}
{"text":"Fucking amazing margaritas and vegan tacos the server we had was incredible, their happy hour is fabulous! #alberto!!!#amazingWaiter"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for casual meals. Their menu is creative and special with almost 30 tacos of your choice and good entrees. If you don't drink, $10-$15 can get you great food and experience. Ben is a great server and always takes care of us whenever we go there. Today, he brought us a sample sauce to try when we're not sure which sauce to choose for our enchiladas. Really appreciate him and this restaurant in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great combo of tacos and beer. Tacos for the most part were great. Service was awesome getting samples to try new beers that I hadn't tried before. Sat at the bar during lunch."}
{"text":"Salsa chips were stale. Our server was nice and quick. The decor of the place was awesome. Happy hour was about to end soon when we got there but a worker helped us out and reminded us to order what we wanted. Prices were decent. Craft beers has a lot to choose from. I would be back for drinks."}
{"text":"I always come to Tacos and Beer and I'm never disappointed. My boy Oscar hooked us up tonight with excellent service. He was on point and checked on us frequently. My girlfriend is vegetarian so we got 2 tacos with no meat, as a meat eater these tacos were out of this world. Don't be afraid to try a few things out of your comfort zone, everything is really good here. Just tried the choco taco for dessert tonight that Oscar recommended and it was amazing. The horchata ice cream was on point! If you are in the area, COME THRU it's bomb"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch one day, I enjoyed it so much I brought the family back for dinner! 
We walked in and were greeted by the hostess, waited a few minutes and were seated. Our waiter was great in taking our drinks. We ordered a few appetizers which he brought out promptly. I ordered the ceviche while the others all ordered tacos. The stuffed jalapenos were tasty. They have great guacamole. Everyone enjoyed their tacos. The ceviche was just ok. About 6 shrimp, with red bell pepper, 2 pieces mandarin orange and some sliced fresh jalapenos. I've had better. I will definitely go back and stick with the tacos, a great variety which all taste great."}
{"text":"Came here to switch up the food from the typical strip stuff and since I've seen the place and been wanting to try it. 

Food - Tacos are cool but aren't great to be a Taco restaurant.  They need to have a bit of more flavor or add a sauce or quac.

Drinks - Had ordered a Michelada it wasn't good at all, so asked for a new one and then it was actually made better.

Service - It was kinda slow when I went so the service was chill but for how slow it was they could of followed up a bit more. 

Venue - Place is chill with a decent layout but a bit too dark in my opinion but not bad of a place. 

Probably will check out other places around town before coming back."}
{"text":"If u could give this place zero stars I would. ANYONE who rates this place higher then zero is basically a moron. This place has the worst and I mean worst customer service possible !!! Rude servers, and extremely slow service. The owners need to fire everyone and rehire people that care about there guests. It took me 2 hours to get 2 beers and I was siting down at a table. What a joke!! When I asked my server if I could order some food he said \"I Guess?\" WOW. Don't go here!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"From the under seasoned tacos to the bad service, this place has no redeeming factors except maybe the light fixtures(?). Honestly, don't waste your time or money on this garbage place. If you're looking for a good taco or a decent dining experience go to Tacos El Gordo or Taco y Taco."}
{"text":"I Love this place!!! The crunchy tacos are amazing. I have ordered many of their menu items and love them all. Drinks are reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! So many different types of tacos you can get from lengua, jackfruit, asada, shrimp pineapple, avocado, and even lettuce shell substitutes! Can't go wrong with cocktails, pitchers, & a large beer list including local beers. I enjoyed the carne asada fries (good side for 2-3 people) and jackfruit taco. My friend had me try her shrimp taco with lettuce shell instead of tortilla too. The shrimp is very flavorful! Our server was very friendly & knowledgeable about the beers. I wish I remembered his name so I could mention him, but next time I'm in town, I'll look for him."}
{"text":"The food was fine, think chevy's quality, but I wouldn't eat here again nor would I recommend it, so two stars. 

-Guacamole: large portion, was brought to our table ice cold; either avocados were in the freezer, or guac was made in the morning & refridgerated. Taste was decent, but I couldn't tell til it thawed. 
-Chicken taqutos: again crazy portion sizes; fat, thick rolled tacos. Ends were crisp the way it's supposed to be, middle was soggy. 
- Tacos: disn't take more than a bite of each. Fish taco tasted like a frozen fish stick, & was kind of fishy. Crispy taco w/ shredded beef was just huge & salty & greasy. 

Obviously, quantity over quality is the name of the game here. 

Waitress was overwhelming. We were one of three parties there before noon & she annoyingly showered us with attention, asking every 5 minutes, \"and how are things tasting?\" I was polite & didn't tell her. 

I'm seeing a pattern with vegas eateries: as long as a restaurant doesn't completely suck, they're bestowed a near-perfect four-star rating. That rating system doesn't work for me."}
{"text":"Food: Best Mexican in Vegas, no the best I've ever had. Excellent flavors. 
Value: Slightly over priced but still worth it.
Service: WAIT TIME WAS 2 hours from the moment I got there till the moment I got my food. I was told I had bad timing, a few big parties were ahead of me. The manager made it up by offering complimentary chips and salsa and free drinks for everyone in my party. 
Atmosphere: Very hipster, classy little spot."}
{"text":"I visited Vegas to party on the Strip, which became reclusive. I discovered Tacos and Beer on the recommendation of a local and I am so glad I ventured here. 

It's a late night, neighborhood gem that had music and patrons dancing on the patio. My friends and I made it just in time for their late night happy hour 11PM-2AM. Chicken quesadillas, Baja fish taco & queso fundido, and chicken/steak nachos were ordered. For happy hour, select tacos were on special, but we chose to partake in the $5 margarita deals + $3.50 bottled beers. The margaritas were ok, either too sweet or tart. No complaints on the food!

Cool vibes, nice decor, and nice atmosphere; I'd definitely visit again when I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Now this is a worthy destination and should be a must do next time you are in Vegas. So many tasty options... 
I had a Chorizo, Baja Fish, Chicken Tiki or something-or-other and a beef tongue.... All awesome!!!  The Margaritas were great too!  And it was taco Tuesday so 50¢ off each taco. So good

Do it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Tacos are beyond delicious. The Veggie and bbq beef are my faves. Frank is also a wonderful server!"}
{"text":"Ok so this is the second time I've been here. I couldn't remember what I didn't like from the first time. I just remembered I didn't plan on coming back. But I met a friend for lunch. He picked here. 

I love the decor! The lights are main with the Jesus candles which is pretty cool!!! And there is a mural of Cheech and Chong behind the bar! Once again awesome!!! 

Drinks- Some beer comes in tall cans so ask before you order. Passion fruit margarita so sour and tart that I couldn't finish mine. It was awful! And it's $9 for a small glass on the rocks! Originally I was going to order a cider but wasn't about to spend $14-$16 on one cider!!! 

Food- Crunchy taco the worst taco I've ever had the meat is drenched in a sauce that tastes sooo bad I didn't even finish it. Shrimp taco had too much going on. And shrimp isn't whole it's pieces. There was no shrimp flavor because of all of the sauces. Best taco was the bean and cheese. It was actually really good and I think it would have been better plain. 

Service was interesting. When I first came in. I said I was expecting someone and took a table. Ordered margarita. The nasty passion fruit one. I asked how it was and he said a little sweet. Liar!!! That thing was like drinking sour candy! And he kept coming up asking if I was ready. Seriously in 10 minutes he came up 5 times. And when my friend sat down asked if we were ready. I literally had to say give us a minute. Geez the guy hasn't even looked at the menu yet. Then he wasn't around when we were ready. Finally he came back and ordered. Two other people came up and checked on us. Then we waiter forever for the check. 

Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"We, Airline Crew Members, have been to Tacos and Beer multiple times. Hanna is our waitress of choice and the best by far. She's fun, friendly and very professional, love her. Food is excellent and good prices. Daily deals are great and beer is colder than anywhere else. Proximity from the Hotel.......next door LOL."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Sunday night. Made it in time for the $5 happy hour margaritas too! I got a chicken burrito which was flavorful and fresh and my boyfriend was pretty happy with his chicken enchiladas. Service was good and the outdoor patio was great! It only looks out over Paradise road but it's still a nice break from the strip."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE this place. You get a huge bang for your buck. If you're vegan/vegetarian there are plenty of really great tacos to choose from. It's a great place to grab a quick bite or hangout and drink! The staff seemed to enjoy their job and were all friendly and pleasant. They've also got a great selection of draft beers that I had never seen anywhere else. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to for tacos! Just brought my family in & we had the best service. Thanks for everything Frank. We'll be back again soon"}
{"text":"Came here with a large group after an event and the staff was wonderful. Quickly accommodated our large party and seated us promptly. The restaurant and bathroom are clean and well-maintained; the decor in both with the European tilework is very pretty. The parking is easy and convenient as their is a parking lot directly in front of the restaurant. It took a little while for our food to come to the table, I was also starving so it might have seemed like forever, but it was delicious! The waiters were great and helped in deciding which tacos are more popular, etc. I got three of the pork tacos (slow-roasted pork, chorizo, and al pastor), which cost me ~$10. I forgot which one, but one had pineapples in it which was my favorite! The tacos are delicious, though a little oily. I also thought they were tiny...I'm 5'2\" and I was content after 3 tacos, but could have easily eaten a 4th. I highly recommend this place to everyone who's looking for some solid Mexican food, especially as they have great vegetarian options, as well! Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I was super sad and disappointed my burrito came with beans inside since I repeatedly said no beans whatsoever since I'm allergic.But Carlos, the manager, was nice enough to offer me a second burrito to pick up tomorrow. Thank you so much ! As a server, I felt really bad calling about it but I was so bittersweet about not getting to try my 13 dollar burrito LOL. But thank you so much Carlos !"}
{"text":"Checked out this spot last night. And it was so GOOD! From the start, pomegranate and pumpkin seed guacamole then some bomb tacos with micheladas and a side of corn salad... to finishing with a delicious churros dessert. My tummy is happy. Mexican food made uniquely and delicious. This will totally be the go to spot when we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, it's not the place to be. But if you are looking for exceptionally tasty \"mexican enough\" food, this is the spot to be. There taco selection is extensive, I'm a huge fan of their al pastor and baja fish. Puerco verde is delicious as well. Tons of beers on tap, hip interior design, and great overall ambiance. 

The only draw back is that this place is a tad pricey for what you get (each taco and side is ordered individually). If you have an average appetite, it's no big deal. You really do get the quality that you pay for. However, if you have a bigger appetite you, might be a bit less satisfied with what you'll spend to fill up.

I would be there every Taco Tuesday if I wasn't worried about my waistline!"}
{"text":"The moment I first walked in I knew it was going to be a fantastic time.  Our waiter, Frank brought us to our table and explained the complex nature of these intricate tacos.  He took his time and was friendly throughout the whole experience.  This place is great.  The tacos themselves were worthy of great praise, and the nitro stout I drank complimented the delicate, yet spicy hot salsa.  Frank is a taco gangsta."}
{"text":"I work very close by so I've been here at least 5x by now. It's delicious and fair prices. I really like the Al Pastor and the Crunchy. The green salsa it the best I've ever had! I love the decor and the staff is really friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Came to tacos and beer for happy hour today for the first time. I was pleasantly surprised! I'm always happy to see quite a few vegetarian options on the menu. The veggie taco was delicious! I can't wait to try to jicama salad next time. 
We had 3 tacos, 2 margaritas and 2 Pacificos for 20 bucks! Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"food and service was great!

Frank was our server and he killed it. this is a must stop in vegas. i had the carne asada fries appetizer and baja fish tacos"}
{"text":"Hello Yelpers, 

A friend and I went here on our lunch break and I have to say I'm a fan. The only reason I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 is because it is a bit pricey for how much you get.

That being said, the food was awesome! The vibe is cool. And the service is good... Bartender, waitresses were all very nice."}
{"text":"The tacos were good and normal sized. The Michelada I ordered had no ice or it melted by the time I got it idk. Servers were great and food came out fast."}
{"text":"Frank, our waiter, was awesome!  The guacamole and chips were delicious and worth the money.  The shrimp and beef barbacoa tacos are amazing.   Definitely recommend eating here, but make reservations because it gets busy."}
{"text":"This is by FAR one our favorite places to have taco Tuesday. The food is amazing and the prices are not high at all. The music is by local DJs and has a vibe that can't be matched!!
The wait staff is always friendly and can recommend great things to try from food to drinks. We did meet one of the managers Manuel garza who took time to make sure we were all enjoying our evening. He suggested a taco we haven't tried and was on point!! He knows his restaurant and was really friendly. 
One of the very BEST local spots in town :)"}
{"text":"I am upgrading this review, as in response to my 1 star after my 1st visit, the owners offered a review of how they're conducting business. It's my fault I haven't stopped by, so I am raising it due to the fact they were offering my allergy free options to me.  Good on them.  I do hope ot stop in and try the options available to me for a happy hour soon."}
{"text":"1. Awesome veggie tacos
2. Awesome rajas tacos
3. Hanna provides fantastic service

I'm on my third day in a row at this place."}
{"text":"Great place.   Food is fresh and flavorful.  Very little heat to any food.  Kids loves it.  The staff are way above average."}
{"text":"Solid joint with decent prices off the strip.  I like that they have options not usually on Mexican taco menus like pulled jackfruit and some good mushroom combos. The beer selections are fair. It was quite busy on a Tuesday night but there was room on the patio. Not much atmosphere looking out on the parking lot but fine.  Wait staff was average,  friendly enough,  got the job done."}
{"text":"They have lots of yummy vegan options here!! I had the veggie tacos and just ordered without the cheese to make it vegan friendly :) cute atmosphere with cool floating candles on the ceiling. Everyone that works here is super nice and friendly! I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Been there 2x both times tacos were delicious! Servers need a lil more help getting the drinks out faster but the food is great! Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I Love this place The tacos are amazing! My girlfriend and I had a great lunch with salsa & chips crunchy tacos with mash potatoes wow really good. The service was good our waiter was really friendly and outgoing and we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great place off the strip. Management really went above and beyond when our food was a little late on a busy night."}
{"text":"Definitely must go, forget about strip foods. This place is cozy and interesting food options. Tacos are delicious and long list of beer to choose from. I visited Vegas two weeks ago, and my two brothers are joining me and I took them tacos and beer. They love it. Oh don't forget bacon wrapped Jalapeño, its YUM!"}
{"text":"It's Tuesday and you're hungry! 

After a long and hot day at the Las Vegas Comic Con, I was hungry for tacos and wanted a chilly IPA in my hand, Tacos and Beer, I see you. First off, the outside is pretty deceiving, like most Las Vegas \"snackateria's\" it's located in a strip mall with a plain look and minimal signage, but when you walk-in it's dark, cool (temp wise) and has clean rustic-hipster look. I'm sold already. 

I went with two tacos; a Fish Taco and the Pork al Pastor plus, chips and salsa, and bacon wrapped jalapenos. The Tacos were amazing, the al Pastor was super tender and the pineapple chunks went with the avocado cream sauce perfectly, great sweet and savory combo. The Fish taco was not fried, but grilled which sometimes can lack in flavor, but this time around that was not the case. Flaky fish, habanero-mango salsa, and cilantro, boom. Definitely a good choice if you're looking for \"lighter\" taco option. 

The Bacon-wrapped Jalapeños were huge and stuffed with cream cheese and came with a guajillo chili sauce. These were a hit it on all cylinders for me, even if it meant I would be paying for it later on in bathroom. 

The service was fast and our waiter knew the beer menu very well, he even mentioned a few beers that weren't on the list, but were still available. If you haven't been here yet, the beer list is pretty extensive, so for him to memorize the entire beer wall menu and know the taps was pretty impressive. 

Tacos and Beer, You have made your namesake proud"}
{"text":"It was off to a slow start, I kept track of how long it took to get our tacos by my check in time and it took 44 minutes to get our 6 tacos. But the staff was apologetic and made sure we were okay so no problem. I understand that since they just opened Tuesday, that  they probably haven't gotten a quick system going yet but I'm sure they'll be faster next time. 
Their beer menu is pretty impressive, I forgot to count but it looked like 6 pages of beer selections and cocktails to choose from. One thing I was a little sad about, no horchata :( I must have horchata  with my tacos!!! Maybe even make an alcoholic version! Lol 
The main thing that makes their tacos stand out is the tortilla! Not too thick or thin, freshly handmade and had perfect texture! Delicious! The guacamole and chips also tasted really fresh and it was a pretty big portion. We ordered 2 pork al pastor, 2 carne asada, 1 beef adobado, and 1 chicken tinga. Oh my, I will definitely be back for the al pastor, it was perfect! The pineapple with the pork and the perfect tortilla, heaven! The carne asada was a little lacking in the seasoning, the adobado had a good flavor to it and so did the chicken tinga. 
The pricing was also  great! Our total bill was $39 for 6 tacos, a cocktail, and guacamole with chips. I will definitely be back to try the other tacos and flan and fingers crossed that it'll be quicker next time! If it is, 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Nice place for locals to
Chill, the tacos are so boom and they have so much variety. Their jamaica mezcal was my favorite drink. And our server Luis was the sweets, he explained everything on the menu and gave great recommendation. I will defiantly come back for more tacos !"}
{"text":"Great place to get tacos in Las Vegas! They make the tortillas in-house and they are amazing. A cool atmosphere & more importantly, the food is great!"}
{"text":"Showed up with my wife and some after a very long trip home, got seated outside was brought some water and that's about as far as we got. There were other people around us getting served and helped by for some reason no one helped us they just stared at us and kept walking by. We waited about 20-30 minutes drank all our water never got a refill tried to flag down someone and no one came back so we left. Went out to our car waited maybe a min or two and the buss boy came running out to clean off the table."}
{"text":"We didn't \"dine in\" but we had some AMAZING, STELLAR and FANTASTIC catering....We ordered the tacos for 12....Seriously we had SO MUCH food leftover that we ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner for almost 4 more days!!!

The staff were so friendly and helpful! The food was OUTSTANDING...Highly suggest this place to any and everyone!"}
{"text":"Not just tacos and beer.  This place gets it.  The best gourmet but not stuffy tacos I've had anywhere.  And the owners bring in real beer, not just Corona but really great micro brews and crafts as well.  I HIGHLY recommend heading here for some amazing food and beer...."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Mexican food but this place has really good tacos. I'm all about the fish tacos that they have. One bite and I was almost in heaven.  Great service. Good atmosphere and I loved what they did with the lighting. Très cool."}
{"text":"Went for a quick bite and stayed longer just to stuff more tacos in my belly. Awesome vibe, love the poster art up on the walls, framed well and good artist choices. Loved it
Good beer and good tacos, that simple. 
GO!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. It really does have the Mexican taste. Fun enviroment nd very friendly staff. Recomended."}
{"text":"Excellent, Excellent , Excellent!!!
The wife and I just ate hear for the first time and it was awesome. We live in San Diego and we know our Mexican food . Ivan was a great server with great customer service. He even brought me a hangover remedy. Worked like a charm!
Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great food but bad servers!! Customer service is key theres good food everywhere in vegas."}
{"text":"Great place to have a night out and not break the bank, it has become our Tuesday spot.
Our server Albert was attentive and friendly, the food runners are polite and explain what the food is when placing it on the table, even the manager comes by and says hello.
The taco menu is creative and tasty with quality ingredients. The beer menu is large with a range of beers from typical to hard to find.
Tacos & Beer has a cool vibe and I recommend checking it out, ask for Albert.

We loved the hand made tortillas that really made the tacos special. We had a carne asada taco, and adobada, a shrimp, and a roja crema. Every one was delicious. The fabulous flan finished off a perfect dinner. And it was prepared in a short time. Very pleased. The atmosphere inside is delightful."}
{"text":"Yelp delivers again! You MUST get their guac with pumpkin seeds and pomegranate. It is earth shatteringly delicious. Daughter loved her passion fruit margarita. Fabulous service by Alberto. Their taco selection is outstanding- very filling. One did the trick for me- but I was enjoying my tequila \"pairing.\" I don't drink beer, but their selection gave my guy pal a tear of joy. Seriously outstanding. Get off the strip and come here NOW!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a good review because the food is delicous, but unfortunately thats about the only good thing there. 

Ive been here three times now. Every time the order is always wrong. I'm very specific about ordering the barbacoa tacos with no cheese and no crema. The first time I went I ordered three but they brought out only one and it took forever so i decided to just not wait another 20 minutes for two tacos. The second occasion they had crema on it still when i ordered it to specficailly not to. People have food allergies so I dont understand why this is taken so lightly to get an order correct. The third occasion being last night I went with a party of 4 and they got our whole order wrong.

First lets talk about service, there's not much to it that is tasteful. Someone came by and dropped off chips and salsa that we didnt request for.  We asked if it was complimentary but they didnt say anything and ended up charging us for it on the bill She wasn't our server but every time she came by to pick up plates she kept on giving us attitude and rude glares. Our server took 15 minutes just to take our drink order and left in such a rush to not even ask if we wanted to order food. He came by 4 times before finally asking if we wanted to order. It isnt our job as a a customer to have to say hey, we're ready to place our order.  This is a rule of thumb in any restaurant - serve your tables with a proper greeting and ask what we would like to drink and order in timely and professional manner. As usual, I ordered my barbacoa tacos with no crema and cheese, three to be exact and I orderd a fourth taco being chicken. Two of my barbaco came out as the crunchy taco which is a different meat and those tacos still had crema and cheese on it. Now i'm left with missing two tacos again having to wait AGAIN for them to be made properly.The upsetting part was that the server repeated the order? So maybe it's kitchen staff who don't know how to read the quanity of how many tacos to make?

I'm never coming back to this place again. It's not that hard to get an order correct and the service doesn't make up for giving this place another shot.

Also, this isn't really a place to bring your kids unless you want them to get a free show. The host wears a really skimpy romper out with no bra. NO BRA! We are not in a nightclub people. This is a dine in restaurant. Where is the uniform? My poor son had to keep looking over at her because her boobs were popping out of her chest. This place is so dissapointing from all the other good yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, knowledgeable staff, food smelled and tasted excellent! Too bad I'm moving to the other side of town, gonna have to make up some excuses to get over here. Had the enchiladas. Prices are reasonable for the area"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and amazing however; the service is always rude . I work nerby so our office frequents this establishment,  we go knowing that we will have a great meal but short, curt and rude servers. I always feel like we are a nuisance to them instead of paying customers."}
{"text":"Amazingly bad service, with great food. Our server abandoned us after we ordered, not allowing us to order anymore drinks or even refill what was on the table. There was around a forty minute period after we finished eating that nobody came over, eventually we flagged down a bus boy who got the waiter. And then our bill included items we didn't even order.

Edit:  The manager reached out to me and discussed the situation.  It sounds like it was just a hiccup that comes with a rookie staff in a recently opened restaurant.  The manager was truly excellent in how he handled my complaints.  I have changed my review score to reflect the food more highly rather than the service, because I believe the service will improve with time.  The food is truly good and they have the best craft beer menu in the area by far."}
{"text":"This place has great beer and tacos. And techno, taco Tuesday was lit. Great place to meet locals and get away from the touristy stuff. Will be attending the event again as well as stopping by for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Corn salad and the guacamole is fantastic! The tacos have a nice fire roasted flavor. Beer selection is extensive and the bartenders are nice and attentive. Garret took good care of us. I love this place! I will be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos & beer!!! Watched the NCAA Championship game too. Had the fish taco, shrimp taco and the pork taco (ask for the three favorites!) and all were very good. Also, get the bacon wrapped jalapeños, not spicy but packed with flavor. We will be visiting each and every time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great place to take people who are visiting Vegas. The location just off the strip makes it the perfect place to pick up visitors and take them to a unique local hang out. The imaginative tacos were amazing and each one I tried tasted incredible.... especially the mashed potatoes in a delicious crispy shell. There really is something on the menu for all dietary needs, even just the picky eater. The atmosphere is awesome with the most amazing lights hanging throughout the restaurant. The staff was attentive and the food came out promptly. We went on taco Tuesday where they have discounted tacos!!"}
{"text":"Fancier tacos for just a little bit more than a taco shop. The restaurant is small and cozy and there's a patio towards the parking lot. Some nights can get reaaally busy and loud. So much so that I've left because I don't want to deal with it. However, their tacos are far better with more variety than you'll get anywhere in town. 

I've had a lot of their tacos but the number one recommendation is: anything with mashed potatoes. It's a game changer. The BBQ beef taco does this well. Lately I've been trying out their vegetarian options and I must say the Veggie taco is surprisingly good. The mushroom is thick and flavorful and of course the potato adds smooth creaminess. I tried the beer battered avocado taco last night. It was packed full of avocado and creamy sauces. The batter definitely reminded me of having a beer battered halibut taco, minus the halibut. I'd probably get this again but it's a lot of food. The guacamole is nothing special, but it is fresh and I like the queso fresco in it. 

I'm usually good just ordering two tacos, and my boyfriend is usually full off of three. I do recommend eating any crunchy tacos first, as they get soggy pretty quickly. Also make sure to ask for hot sauces, they have four to choose from. Overall it's a great place to bring friends and family. There's a lot to explore on the menu and the quality is a surprise to people expecting taco shop food. Check the website to see if there are events going on to avoid the place being packed and loud music, unless you're into that."}
{"text":"I love this place! Our server Frank was the best! Great service. Every time I come to Vegas I HAVE to stop here! The food is so good. The best gourmet tacos in the country! Come here!! I also love the ambiance. On Tuesday's they have discounts."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff and great atmosphere. Would make a great place for a casual date. Prices are good. And the food is amazing! I got the steak, al pastor, shrimp and fish tacos. They also have a good beer selection on tap."}
{"text":"*our waiter was super friendly and our food came out super fast

*The chips were probably made there because they came out hot and were so amazing

*the tacos were some of the best tacos I've had in Vegas

*the only downfall, be prepared to pay $4.25 for ONE taco. AND everything is ala carte.

* I heard it's only $2 for tacos during happy hour. Will definitely be coming back but during that time only."}
{"text":"Often go here late at night for happy hour and they have $2 and $3 tacos and cheap beer specials. The flavour is amazing! The service is fantastic! I recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious taco-- not overly authentic but still has lots of delicious Mexican flare. Relatively new-- I have a feeling they will do well!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food. My friends and I were looking for a place after work to just relax. We found this place and were not dissapointed. We sat at the bar and ordered tacos and some cocktails. I recommend the Puerco Verde taco and for signature drinks,  I recommend the Dirty South Andy. Just an overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Okay so this is my first time trying this place and I love it! I had their corn salad and two different type of vegetarian tacos. Their prices are so reasonable so I am deff coming back. But one thing Do Not order their taco salad."}
{"text":"Came here after the Mr. Olympia expo for some tacos and beer and this place by far has exceeded my expectations. Tried almost every taco here along with their ceviche, bacon wrapped jalapeños & asada fries and we couldn't get enough. After all my 28 years of eating I've never had such amazing food."}
{"text":"I had a great experience sitting at the bar, the bartender was very nice and the ambiance is great for watching a sporting event in a low key environment. 

The items I had were: 

Corn salad- more like a corn salsa, went well with the chips

Pineapple habenaro salsa- good flavor profile but didn't care for the apple sauce like consistency 

Cilantro lime rice- cooked well but could barely make out the cilantro and lime 

Carne Asada- extremely salty 

Pork al pastor- this was my favorite of the three tacos because it had the most balanced flavors 

Fish- very juicy fish but a little salty and was not a fan of the flour tortilla

Churros- cooked to perfection, maybe a little too much cinnamon sugar but this was my favorite of the night 

Overall, this restaurant is very promising and sets itself apart from other Vegas restaurants with its friendly and competent service."}
{"text":"Excellent! I cannot say enough good things about this place. DELICIOUS tacos, great vegetarian options and it's off the strip but super close. It's a great escape and really good Mexican that isn't commercialized and super flavorful."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but everything else is just bad, ( accept the salsa that comes with the chips... Which you do pay for ) first of all it's called tacos and beer but when you go in it doesn't feel like a place to relax and drink a beer it's more like a stuffy date restaurant with low lighting, they are really over priced for the portions they give and their food is nothing special. It's really uncomfortable if you have kids and the tables are over crowded with stuff. Would never eat there again and I love mexican food."}
{"text":"Very good taplist and bottles, particularly for Vegas. Reasonable prices just a little off the strip and near the Convention Center.
Tacos were pretty good, hand made tortillas with tasty fillings.
Service was pretty poor, despite it not being busy."}
{"text":"Three tacos are my max. I had the fish, shrimp and veggie taco along with a Moscow Mule. I ate two baskets of chips and dip before the food came. I enjoyed the interior decorations and lighting as well."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in town! The el pastor tacos and the churro are a must try! Their chips and salsa are super fresh and delicious too. Yummy food, cool environment, and thy play dope house music on Sunday nights! Super affordable and so bomb."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found tacos & beer the first time I came was a few years back and I hadn't forgotten how bomb it was so I definitely had to come back.

The restaurant is very nice very clean with plenty of seating with a very popular patio area as well. But since it was full we had to sit inside no problem. Took a minute for a waiter to come over but it's all good we're on vacation. Our waiter was a really cool and relaxed guy he was super helpful as my dining companion had a bunch of questions.

So to start things off right we got the house margaritas One frozen the other on the rocks. Omg it was soo good you can tell they use fresh lime or an in-house mix because it was so flavorful and not overly sweet. As an appetizer we ordered the chips and salsa it came with a roasted tomato and an avocado tomatillo salsa it was absolutely delicious and definitely homemade. It wasn't spicy which I was kind of hoping it would be but if that's what you're into this would be perfect for you.

For my entrée I ordered three tacos  The barbecue beef, the Carnitas, and the Baja fish all were amazing! My favorite had to be the barbecue beef with the mashed potatoes shredded lettuce and sour cream all the flavors combine perfectly and the crispy shell perfectly complemented this taco. The fish was delicious too it had to be my second favorite cooked perfectly w/flaky fish and slaw w/the lime crema and guac mixed it was perfect together overall great flavor. I wanted to try the Carnitas because the pictures looked so good. I thought it was OK but it was my last favorite I think it was because of the chicharrones they tasted too intestine like. Which lets me know they must be fresh and not from the bag like I'm used to.

Anyway all in all I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food! Ive been here several times and tried lots and everything has been absolutely amazing. Why the 3 star you might wonder? 

Everytime ive gone service is bad which i dont understand why when they are always over staffed. When i sit at a table there's a guy that brings you water, the server that takes your order and the runner that delivers your food, and in your 30 minute dining experience youve had 3 different people come to your table. And no one comes back to make sure you're ok maybe because they all think the other person is checking in.

Today i was frankly fed up with it, which led me to finally writing a review because i noticed its an ungoing problem. I went in around 5:30 sunday july 30th sat at the bar, bartender was chatting with some girl seemed like her friend. Didnt say anything finished her conversation grabbed some menus without sayin a word. I said \"hi how are you\" otherwise there would have been no interaction other then what can i get for you. We ordered our food, food came out and we got half way done with our food and i needed hot sauce so i then got up to ask for hot sauce because by now she had some other friends she was busy talking to. 

This bothers me greatly because i am in the industry. Ive served ive managed and i would never allow unfriendly people to be in customer service. I understand life happens and it might not be your day but get your shift covered or leave it at the door. We are paying patrons that expect an experience when dining out. 

you are handicapping your business with people that cant provide good service for your patrons."}
{"text":"I love this place, especially their carnitas tacos with chicarrones. It's a decadent bite of pork goodness and at $3.75 each the price is right. When I'm burned out on The Strip, I hit Tacos and Beer for, well, tacos & beer without pretense."}
{"text":"Truly amazing Tacos, so unusual and so cool. Service wasn't amazing, but once the food came, it was quickly forgotten. The Carnitas were a stand out, as well as the bean and cheese."}
{"text":"Joseline the host at the door was very rude with me. Another host made an error when I approached and seated me immediately. Joseline scalded the other host in front of me and then acted like it was my fault that I was seated. I do not appreciate the tone directed towards me and disregard I was shown. I expected better customer service. I know the food is good here but this just ruined my experience and I left the restaurant to a more accommodating location. I will probably avoid this location for a while due to the hostess and her aggressive and demeaning attitude"}
{"text":"I am IN LOVE with this place. My friend Dannions dad owns this place and it's amazing. The prices are fair and the tacos are amazing. I'm usually a chicken person but I've ventured out and tried many of their options. I tend to come on Tuesday because they have a taco Tuesday deal! My absolute favorite thing on the menu is their guacamole it's delicious! It's always busy at any time that I've come! I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Tacos and Beer blew me away. So many delicious tacos and our server, Alan explained everything like a true badfish. I will definitely be returning not only for the great food and beer, but for the fantastic service!"}
{"text":"We gave this restaurant a second chance and this second visit in comparison to the first one below was a total 180! The food,service, prompt and efficient service was impeccable. Our server, Armando, was beyond attentive and knowledgeable. The GM and Manager, Manuel and Carlos were equally hospitable to not only us but, all the customers dining. Everyone helped out with serving, cleaning and seating that this was the best teamwork I have seen in any restaurant so far. Round of applause to this restaurant and we hope to see another location up by our neck of the woods soon. Affordability meets Quality!! Bravo!!! You have gained a couple of regulars and many more to follow us..
First review below but, I want to state that our complaint was with the service not the food...
My husband suggested this place because he heard the food was good. So, we were first timers here. May I just say that the food would've tasted so much better had we had good customer service and hot food. When we walked through the door, there was no greeting. The hostess walked passed us to seat another person. It is Sunday and there were only 4 tables with people... meaning they were not busy at all. They had one hostess, one bartender, and about 6 people maybe more in the kitchen. So, the hostess comes back and she seats us. We wait about five minutes, then we get served our water. Again, this is our first time, so we start asking the person serving our drinks to us about their sauce and options about the menu and he was clueless. So, I ask him \"Are you our server?\" and he says \"Ah, good question\" smiles and walks away. So, we wait another 15minutes, looking at the menu... then the hostess who sat us comes over and to our surprise, she is also our server. So, we start asking about the menu & order our food. Now, I don't know who hasn't been to a Mexican restaurant but, normally when you order Chips & Salsa (which wasn't free) you get it before your meal comes out. So, we are talking, having conversation and about another half hour later, No Chips , No Salsa or my extra side of Refried Beans. So, we get caught up in conversation again... another 15minutes goes by, and our food arrives.. not hot but lukewarm... and still No Chips or salsa. So, assuming they forgot, I told the guy who served us our food to just cancel the Chips, Salsa and Refried beans... he says \"Oh, you ordered Chips& Salsa? I'll get it now\" ... he then goes to the hostess/Server and tells her. Then, comes back to me and says \"So you sure you wanted to cancel the chips & salsa?\" I say yes and he apologizes. Mind you, only one other table sat down after us making a total of 6 tables filled now. In addition, our hostess/server did not check on us at all until the middle of our lunch. She did not apologize for the mistake in our chips&salsa order either. The table that sat waaayyyy after us also got their food before us. The only time our supposedly hostess/server was nice was as the end , when we asked for the check and a to go box. Don't get me wrong, the food here is good and I wish the service was better. I have a background in customer service and management and if this was my restaurant, I would want someone to let me know what I could do to improve it. Well, this is me telling them what needs to improve. I only gave this place 2 stars for 1) the food and 2) because I feel bad that I can't give more. Normally, I take pictures of the decor, menu and the food but, I was distracted by the lack in customer service that I just wanted to hurry up and eat and leave."}
{"text":"Nice decor, very nice hostess, great server named Karen. Tacos were ok. 4 stars because of the service."}
{"text":"We came to Tacos and Beer for the first time! Frank was our server, he was awesome! Really knowledgeable and helpful, with great recommendations! We tried the Cadillac Margarita and so many awesome tacos! Definitely recommend this place, awesome food, fantastic service and really well priced, unlike the strip a few blocks over which can get really pricey for mediocre service. This place is a must when in Vegas."}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us were in Vegas for a birthday, and came across this place. Amazing tacos! There is such a variety of taco fillings and meat. The guacamole and chips are also a must-have. They have a really good chips to guacamole ratio, and even offered us more chips after. Great food, customer service, and ambiance. Can't wait to come back to Vegas so we can eat here again."}
{"text":"Waiter Alfredo was the best! The food & drink were exceptional! Anytime in the area is a must!"}
{"text":"i am so glad i tried this place, i was there last saturday and i came back today, the have my favorite beers dogfish 120, cantillon sour , i tried an italian IPA that they recommended it was delicious they have that on draft. 
service was great, very friendly staff and everyone very attentive i sat at the bar and jesus was the bartender cool guy very knowledgeable.
the place is super cool. the decoration is unique, best tacos in las vegas, im from mexico and i know about tacos, these are different but good, they use traditional mexican ingredients, but the decoration is fancy...... i tried all the deserts and my favorite was the flan......"}
{"text":"Food was ok but all the tacos seemed to have the same flavor. Might revisit in the future. Drinks were good, I tried the michelada my girl tried s mojito and s long island ice tea, strong drinks."}
{"text":"I had been here before but tonight I was very disappointed. The service was slow and the first tacos I ordered were cold. Not sure what happened since the last time I was here. I gave it 3 stars because even though the tacos were cold they were still good. Hopefully they get it together because this used to be one of my favorite spots in Vegas"}
{"text":"This place was very trendy didnt wait long tacos where amazing my fav are tacos al.pastor and the flan is bomb.com def coming back"}
{"text":"Zero wait, very nice staff, and epic food! The beef crunchy taco is amazing! Such simple ingredients but the flavors are on point. The shrimp taco is great as well, the marinated is what makes it. The margaritas pitcher is a great value and actually strong. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and ambiance!! The service was top notch! We had a party of 7 and all of us were given individual attention.  This is a must if you are in Vegas. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"When I first entered in, I noticed a nostalgic feel from the decor & paintings to the rustic woodworks of the restaurant etc., I felt I was in for a great dining experience.

The staff was friendly and we were given a table and menus. Drinks were ordered and appetizers were on its way.

The first to arrive were our chips & salsa (green & red salsa) - but the shining star was the guacamole! We liked it so much, we had to order additional portions.

The next appetizer that arrived was the Bacon Wrapped Jalepeños! Wow! Mild sweet Jalapeños wrapped in smokey bacon. The name alone should have you salivating already! This is the other shining star of the appetizer menu!

The food arrived for our party and I remember how everyone was commenting on how fresh the tortillas were and hailing the guacamole as an encore.

I ordered the hamburger with guacamole & creme. It came with a side of chips and cheese sauce (homemade!!) my birder was awesome - though they did forget the guacamole creme, but quickly redeemed themselves by giving me some on the side.

We stayed and enjoyed our food and conversation. The staff were pleasant and nice. We even took a selfie with one member of the waitstaff!

The place does get busy! We were smart to arrive at the beginning of happy hour!


The prices are pretty fair, our only negative experience was the wait time for our second round of drinks.

I would definitely come back again with friends or other coworkers.

That's my 2 Cents :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! the food is to die for! I've only had one bad experience: I called to order for take out and the lady answered with \"thanks for calling Tacos and Beer please hold..\" so I held....and held...and held until I started hearing the hosts chatting back and forth \"yeah she's covering my saturday\" blah blah blah. So she had forgot she had me on hold. I was on hold for 20 minutes until I hung up. Unfortunately when I hung up and called back, the call wouldn't go through because the phone was off the hook and obviously the host wasn't realizing any time soon that she had someone on the line. I ended up having to go in to order for take out, then wait for my food. The phone was still off the hook when I got there. love the food though!!"}
{"text":"Good food in heaven !!!Oh my gosh you have got to eat here or even postmates here , they are worth every penny !! This is my second time ordering from postmates ,wish uber eats could use them too however just glad I could order!

Love love the food everything I've tried has been delicious and fantastic
Love you cooks preparers and servers 
Your food makes me happy

I review I thought I posted"}
{"text":"Just popped in for a quick bite and sat at the bar by myself. The bartender Katie was nice, attentive and helpful. They have an extensive number of beers on tap, all different styles. I was happily allowed to sample one before choosing. I tried the lengua and the barbacoa tacos, both fresh and delicious. They give you a selection of homemade taco sauce on the side, also tasty. Rather than try a third taco (next time!) I had the flan for dessert., some of the best I've had. Can't wait to go back to try more tacos and the churro dessert!"}
{"text":"5th time here. Worst service, no management to be seen. Sat 12 Minutes without being greeted. Walked out. 2nd bad review now and I'm a server"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Taco Tuesdays. This is the old Firefly location on Paradise Road. Lots of gourmet tacos to choose from and ALL of the ones I tried were amazing. Tons of beers on tap and in bottles. 

PROS: Puerco Verde taco- shredded pork,green sauce, Chicharróns & cheese
            Bean & cheese taco - pinto refried beans, cheese & pickled onions.
            Crunchy Taco - mashed potatoes, ground beef, lettuce, cheese 
            Al pastor taco -  marinated pork, pineapples, pickled onions & avocado sauce

CONS: Carne Asada taco (wasn't crazy about it but it was \"aight\")"}
{"text":"This place should get ten stars but I only have five to work with.  The best tacos I have ever eaten, plus a great craft beer list and amazing flan.  Excellent atmosphere and music, live band was setting up but we left before they started.  Manager came by and shook our hands and told us all about the business.  We will never visit Vegas again without hitting up Tacos and Beer!!"}
{"text":"I'm a simple, arguably pathetic, guy. So in the morning as I drove past Tacos and Beer, I kept thinking oh tacos and beer. It didn't require a great deal of my limited reserve of cerebral abilities to decide 1-I like tacos and I like beer and 2-I should go there. In fact that's about all that went into it. But enough about me and my life without Adderal. This place had great tacos. Great beer and drink selection and a menu that explains everything including the price and size of their beers. To sum things up in two words: I come back."}
{"text":"The name doesn't lie. Some interesting taco choices and beer choices.

About a 10-15 minute walk from the Las Vegas Convention Center or Sands. Near a few hotels as well. 

Good service and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Really good they have a new Techno Taco Tuesday where they charge $5 at the door because they have a tent outside"}
{"text":"We celebrated our friend bday at this restaurant. It was designed as a sport bar restaurant with different monitors around the place. It was a little dark inside but you will be able to see. I ordered 3 veggies tacos and man they were delicious. I am not an expert in Mexican food but I have to admit they are good. They have a good selection of beer as well. Their margaritas can be either on ice or snow ice. It is sure definitely a good spot if you are craving for tacos and sport."}
{"text":"Stopped in late late for some tacos. Not bad! Sauces were great and at 1 am, service was fantastic! Go Here Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. One week, I visited this hot spot three times! It's a hit or miss with the costumer service though. So hopefully it's a good night..."}
{"text":"Great local spot off the strip. The cost of the cab will be more than the meal! Great beer selection. Awesome service with a neat little patio.
Go...."}
{"text":"For a beer right off of Howard Hughes, this place could be my new after work spot.  Their selection of draught beer actually was quite surprising.  They had the usual options like Dogfish and Ballas Point that you can find easily throughout Las Vegas restaurants and stores, but they also had rarer varieties like Stone specialties, Evil Twin, and an extensive bottle list.

I came to have a few beers after work with some others and I guess we missed the Happy Hour, but supposedly it ends at 6:00PM.  My main complaint is the seating issue I encountered.  We had trouble finding a seat immediately so we decided to go to the bar and still put our name down for a supposed 10 minute wait.  20 minutes later we finally got seated, though we noticed 3 separate tables throughout the restaurant stay open the entire time.  We never got updates from the hostess and those tables stayed open (on a Friday night) for the entire 1-2 hours we were there.

For a nice beer with a crowd of younger, working class people, this is your palce near the Corporate sector of town.  The prices are more in line with the strip, however.  I have not been for Happy Hour and do not know the deal, but I would be back.  Just don't expect the service to blow you away."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference, and rather than staying on the strip, I yelped a highly rated restaurant and behold, with a name like Tacos & Beer, we really couldn't go wrong. We took a cab over and discovered this gem. It was fairly dark in there, reminiscent of a dive bar, but much much cleaner.

First of all, our server, Noemi was amazing. She was super helpful, nice and happy. The four of us each ordered some beer, and a couple tacos.

The tacos were better than average. My taco standard is fairly high though. I thought the lengua tasted a little gamey, but the pastor and carnitas were good. I also thought it a little odd that the hot sauces are chilled. We also got the queso, which was awesome.

Also of note, the taco trays can be flipped upside down to accommodate 2 or 3 tacos! I'm guessing other people knew that already, but it kinda blew my mind. 

If you get time to head off-strip and want some good tacos and a good beer list, head over here for some cheap eats and drinks with no BS service."}
{"text":"It was my first time in Vegas and this was the best service my boyfriend, friemd and i have EVER received. The Manager, Carlos sat us at our table and we were so hungry we had to order the second we sat. He npt only took our order but waited on us the entire time! We received a free beer sampler after discussing how my bf and him shared the same beer tastes. Not only Carlos, but the rest of the staff was amazing. On top of everything they were speedy! They really wanted to makes sure we enjoyed ourselves and you can tell EVERYONE cares about the business. They treated all the customers so nicely. The tacos were unique and DELICIOUS. The guac was fresh and fish as well. Definitely coming back when I go for my next visit ! If i could give a million stars for this place I would !!!! THANK YOU TACOS & BEER !!!"}
{"text":"Louis was a wonderful server!!! Excellent food and event better drinks! A place to go on a night out or a rough work week."}
{"text":"The flautas were amazing and the tacos were very good! The service was excellent. Alyssa, you rock!"}
{"text":"The name is so simple and basic, but is far from being the two. The place had a welcoming and comforting feel the moment I walked in. 

I sat at the bar and began looking at a menu, but my attention was diverted to the giant board with a list of beers available on draft. This place is a craft beer drinkers heaven. The board covers a lot of beer styles from bitter pale ales to tart and sour ales. Really great beer selection here. They also have a cooler with bottles beers for in-house consumption. Although a bit pricey, most were all from respectable breweries.

There's quite a bit of tacos to choose from. Whether you're a carnivore, vegetarian or pescatarian, they have it all covered. I ended up ordering the flautas because they will always hold a special place in my heart.

The food was good and the beer was even better. I am definitely returning to keep up with the draft beer changes and to try all the tacos!"}
{"text":"What a great experience!! From the entrance to the dessert!! 
Raquel the hostesses was so friendly and attentive, same as Alberto our server who guide us thru all this amazing menu!! Manuel the manager recommended us this new cocktail drinks of mezcal and bourbon to die for it!! 
Can't wait to come back and try all those 20 craft beers on top!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the staff was a little all over the place. Service was unfortunately slow and when I asked for salt to take with our shots I had to ask 4 different people before I realized it wasn't coming and had to go to the bar to ask a bartender for salt lol what a joke right... But the bartenders are on point there and food was brought out in a timely manner. Hopefully better service on the next visit I'm not writing this place off just yet."}
{"text":"Muy delicioso! I will certainly be back to this little joint :-) I only tasted two of their tacos, the carne' asada and the carnitas tacos. I have a feeling lots of items on this menu kick ass! My friend ordered a chicken burrito with no sour cream or guacamole inside and though that is how I personally like it... it 
tasted amazing :-)also, he does not eat beans, so... Guess who scored... Me! Two tacos and beans, I was full and happy :-) go here  & you will not be disappointed.  Bottom line:  good food, service and many options.  Go."}
{"text":"If you guys want a bomb taco this is the place to go the food is so good. It's a really fun place to go for after work or family night or a chill date night. It's a fun atmosphere and the drinks are good and strong as well. You see them making the tacos so you know what your getting. The decor is pretty dope to."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! I love bringing friends here that have never been :) 

My favorites: the beer selection. The fresh made tortillas are to die for!!! They're like little sponges of awesomeness heaven that carry my taco filling perfectly and melt in your mouth. I could probably eat the tortillas by themselves lol. The tomatillo salsa is perfect. Service was prompt and friendly 

My real only complaint is no complimentary chips and salsa, cmon! :( and they skimp big time on the chips and salsa when you do order it. No mi gusta. Fix this and it'd be a 5 star for sure."}
{"text":"Love the rotating selection of craft beer, and the tacos are excellent. Really love this place. I always sit at the bar and get good service there."}
{"text":"Great tacos!! I ordered the Barbacoa, Al Pastor and the shrimp taco.

The Barbacoa was the best one! 
Al pastor, the meat was juicy and delicious but I personally am not a fan of pineapple in my taco. 
Shrimp taco was decent, nothing special.
They all were still worth traveling down to try.
On Tuesdays tacos are .50 off! 

Definitely try this place. 
Love their beer selection too. 
Great, fast service."}
{"text":"Food is great but service definitely lacks. Love coming here for lunch but they could have some better service."}
{"text":"Place was very busy. Service was great. Not my type of food which is normally fine since I'm picky, but my mother and husband were not happy either. And we all love tacos."}
{"text":"Staff was amazing. Loved their beer selection. Definitelymiss my tacos from Tijuana but these weren't too bad. Love the different toppings they have on tacos. I was too stuffed for dessert, but will be back to try them."}
{"text":"One of my perennial 5-star places. If you like tacos and great Mexican food, you need to try this place. The quality is unmatched and the waitstaff is very good. The beer selection is constantly rotated and there is great attention to details so you know what you are getting."}
{"text":"Great place to go for tacos and beer. They have a good selection of tacos, including some vegan and vegetarian options. They also make a MEEEAAAAN churro. If you're not in the mood for tacos, they also offer other food options such as empanadas (highly recommended) and burritos. I was only in town for a few days, but I went here twice. I will warn you, the beer prices are a bit on the high side. Other than that, this place was A-OK!"}
{"text":"I was referred to this place by their sister restaurant (FireFly).
Just walking distance from each other, I'm so glad they did.

First thing I noticed, obviously, was the outside seating. Very casual and fun vibe to hang out with friends.
Inside, it's dim with religious candles acting as ceiling lights, giving this place a \"dia de los muertos\" kind of feel.

I sat at the bar.  Comfortable bar stools and enough space to enjoy dinner without feeling crammed.  
Immediately I was greeted and had a menu in front of me.  

They have a full bar and a variety of margaritas, with happy hour specials, and Taco Tuesday discounts.
I started with a Passion Fruit Margarita and absolutely loved it.   Great balance between tequila and the fruit, keeping the tartness of it.

Even though it was Taco Tuesday, I went with a Shrimp Quesadilla.  Excellent choice.  Generous amount of delicious shrimp, with perfectly melted cheese, and a small side of salad and guacamole, if you want to add to the quesadilla or eat on its own.  

Before I was done, I had to try one more margarita.  This time I went with the Jalapeño one.  Another winner.  

Drinks and food were great but, what I liked most about this place was the service.  I went by myself and not even for a second did it feel like it.
The bartenders were so attentive, friendly and funny.  They included me in conversations, made fun of each other just to get a laugh out me, made sure I enjoyed my dinner...  5 stars all around!

This is a place I would definitely go again and would recommend to anyone in, or traveling to, Vegas."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat off the LV Strip.  Great Beer selection and wonderful mixed drinks.  Very nice selection of tacos.  When we were there they even had live music.  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Dang good tacos. Coming from San Diego, I think I'm a bit of an authority on the matter, haha. Very attentive staff and good beer selection."}
{"text":"I hate large groups, and I hate that I was apart of one. We're annoying and we split the check 3 times out of al 12/16 of us? But our server was great about it all. Thankfully. 

We all ordered 2-4 tacos each. I myself had more beer than I should have, which they have a pretty extensive and awesome craft beer list, and so ultimately forgot specifically what I liked about the tacos. Oh, lengua! I think that's how you spell it. I'm used to the texture being chewy, and full of flavor. I prefer it to be that way, similar to burnt ends. BUT, this was done slow cooker style. It was soft and the texture freaked me out. It was a me thing, I just don't like tofu textured protein, unless it's actually tofu. The Barbacoa (sp?) was AMAZING. As it always is. 

Overall, I enjoyed the flavors, they were fresh. I love cilantro! The proteins were all done pretty well. We had a vegetarian at the table, who loved the jackfruit other vegetarian options!

Because our table was too much to handle, I ran up to the bar to order drinks. Our sever was just too overwhelmed with us. But the busser/food runner was awesome! Constantly refilling water, clearing tables and gave me napkins! Too bad he wasn't the server. 

Awesome, up beat atmosphere. Great for a fun/hype crowd. Just a short drive away from the strip."}
{"text":"Do NOT waste your money here.  I don't understand how people can like this food.  I wouldn't eat here for free.  I also went with a cook who is from Mexico who got \"the runs\" from their tacos.  They boil their meats....... I tried every taco on the happy hour menu and the margherita........ The deink tasted like soap and the tacos were absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the service even better.armando was awsome And made my son's birthdays (twins) Great. 
I love the vegetarian and vegan options they have on trhe menus too."}
{"text":"Good service, tacos are big not your regular street tacos. Drinks are also good and pricing is fair."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and always had a great experience. I tacos are a la carte, so you can pick and choose which ones you want. They have a few tacos that are vegetarian, and they're really good. They have a happy hour where some of the tacos are $2. The average price per taco is between $2.50-$3.50 each. I typically eat a lot and get full off of 3-4 tacos. The beers are pretty cheap ($3.00ish) for happy hour as well. They have a wide variety of beers as well. Service is great and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I'll make this short a sweet, me and some friends came just for some drinks with high hopes but it was nothing but a let down. The drink prices were okay because of happy hour but the customer service if you can even call it that was horrible!!!! I will definitely not be returning!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  Great guacamole,  great salsa, great corn salad, fresh and awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner today, (Tuesday) 
The service was GREAT, very attentive, and quick!
The tacos were delicious. The handmade tortillas really add to the taste.
We tried just about every taco on the menu.
The ones that really stood out were the Puerco Verde Taco, Adobada Taco, Al Pastor and Crunchy Taco. These were absolutely amazing. We did not enjoy the Carne Asada taco or shrimp taco as much as the others, but they were okay.

The chips and salsa were fresh.
All around great food, keep it up!"}
{"text":"Great food. Taco Tuesday is a great time to try the different types of tacos. Awesome place to meet friends and have a few drinks while enjoying some tacos."}
{"text":"Very yummy! I'd recommend the tacos they were sooo good, Especially the Al Pastor! Also recommend the bbq beef.

Entrees were not as impressive. 
Nachos aren't as loaded and flavorful as you would want for $9. The steak had spot on flavor but it was a bit chewy.

It's nice to get off the strip in Vegas and find normal spots to eat and hang out.  

This place has great drinks and decor even though its located in a strip mall it doesn't feel like you are just in a strip mall. 
Great spot to hang out and stuff some margaritas & tacos in your system."}
{"text":"We only had drinks here, but I wanted to acknowledge how great the staff and management are. We were attended to right away but our server got slammed and forgot the second round. After 20 minutes we asked to cancel the beer and bring the check. The server profusely apologized and took the extra beer off of our check. The manager also came over and apologized. We appreciated the make up for the mishap!"}
{"text":"Went here after the service at Bandito was poor. So glad we did! The atmosphere was upbeat and fun. Service was good and the food was excellent. The bacon wrapped jalapeños are a must! Great variety of tacos and a massive selection of beer. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best beef tounge taco I've had yet. Ambiance is pretty good. Service excellent. Prices good. Close to the strip"}
{"text":"Okay, so I rarely dole out 5 star rating but IT&B is awesome. We went here after a long ass day and it was just what the doctor ordered. 
We were greeted by one of the owners, whom was exceptionally nice and overly apologetic for the wait. We had a group of 7, no reservations and arrived at 7:30. We were expecting to wait, but he insisted it was abnormal and offered us each a drink as the restaurants apology. 
We got a strawberry marg, Dirty South Andres and a traditional marg which all were awesome. 
The chips, salsa and gauc are amazing. I'm from LA. We don't fuck around with chips and salsa so believe when I say they are good. 
We all got tacos. An assortment. We got a both types of fish taco, carne asada, shrimp, chicken and carnitas and let's just say it was silent for 10 mins at our table of 6 girls and myself while we stuffed ours faces and looked up at each other reassuringly. If you're in Vegas and want a inexpensive meal - off the strip - go to IT&B. 5 stars. All night and day! 
The decor is legit too. Chalked full of kitschy Mexican art and candles. I was a huge fan of the taco chested Virgin Mary in the entry!"}
{"text":"I love the fish tacos here. I have had the grilled and the crispy and both are amazing. I prefer the crispy, though, but I get both. 
The happy hour deals are good too and the patio is a nice place on a nice day.
The management is very friendly here, too (at least who I think was management) and made sure we were taken care of the whole time. 
They also (obviously) have a pretty extensive beer list, but their cocktails are pretty interesting and tasty, too. If I allowed myself tacos more often, I would be here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin...last night I order from Grubhub, order 30 mins late n cold and asked for no creama, yep creama, missing food (Steak Hurricane). Called the restaurant, they stated \"having issues w/Grubhub iPad\", \"yes, I see the Steak Hurrricane\", \"you can come n pick it up or leave your name n # n mgr will call you back\" I said no, please have mgr call me back....13 hrs and counting NO CALLBACK!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and once again the best bargain in town.  Try the moody tongue barley wine to go with the tacos. Nicole was over the top with service!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, great tacos, great micheladas, the flautas were incredible and great service! Can't wait to come back and try dessert! Only thing is my boyfriend tried the chorizo one of his favorite but he mentioned they didn't have much taste...other than that everything was excellent!"}
{"text":"This place hands down has the best tacos not only in Vegas but the best I've ever had! We so happened to go on taco Tuesday when it was 50c off but I would pay full price any day. They have a huge selection including vegan tacos. Their chicken asada, carnitas and chilli verde tacos were my absolute favorites, best part about the whole thing, the tortillas are hand made in restaurant! As soon as you take a bite, it melts in your mouth. Our sever told the cooks how much we loved them that they all started staring and smiling. We walked out with at least 6 \"have a good night!\"s haha. Most definitely a stop everytime we come out here, not to mention really good mango margaritas."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner after a conference when we decided we would rather eat somewhere off the strip instead of inside one of the casinos. Was greeted promptly at the door and sat immediately despite the fact us coming in at peak dinner hour of 6:30pm. Service was great, food came quick and one of the managers named \"Manny\" came by, very nice guy. He even comped us a dessert after our meal just because!

I highly recommend this spot for delicious Mexican fare! Order some margaritas and watch a game on one of the multiple TVs in the venue!

I will return!"}
{"text":"Stopped here just by pure serendipity.  Wow, what luck. The tacos are delicious and more importantly they each have a distinctly different flavor. The service was Superb, Armando (?) And the rest of the staff h I mentioned an unusual taco that I had at a place 100s of miles away and containing ingredients not even on their menu, in a few minutes two appeared on the table. Amazing flavors, and each type different. So often the difference between tacos seems to be crunchy or soft but the flavors were each wonderful.  

Tacos are only half of the name though and the beer list almost out shone the tacos. Rare and flavorful beers from all over. Yes, you could drink the common mexican beer, but why when their are so many amazing flavors to try. With a 20 beer tap list on a chalk board, they change so often that naming them would be pointless, but the manager knows his beer so they are all amazing. If you are feeling adventurous, get a flight of six, 5 oz. beers. The bottle list is pages long and incredible. 

Seriously wonderful food and drinks."}
{"text":"Margaritas were a small but tasty. Tacos and Queso were definitely a cut above the rest enjoyed this place during our trip to Vegas gave a nice local vibe with great food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to visit on #TacoTuesday Tacos are $.50 off and the variety is amazing! Make sure you save room for dessert, the churros and chocolate tacos are great but the FLAN is outstanding! Trust me, you'll thank me later"}
{"text":"If you're hungry and you know it clap your hands! Not sure where that came from, but this place will offer tasty tacos and Mexican delights at late hours of the night! 

Had some flautas and drinks here, and overall had a good time. The bartender was very down to earth and always attentive. This seems to be popular little hangout spot for locals and tourists alike. A great place to grab a tasty snack and drinks."}
{"text":"We stay in Vegas for the WSOP every year and this time we stumbled upon this taco place. The tacos were awesome!! I thought the staff were friendly and inviting. The best part is that they stay open late and offer a nice late night option. Also this place is affordable. Will be a regular customer every  year we are here!"}
{"text":"They have some solid tacos for affordable prices. The best part about this place is their beer selection. They had a diverse selection of IPAs on tap."}
{"text":"Awesome place for great tacos with hand made tortillas and delicious beer. Will definitely stop by again when i go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"First let me say that I am not a beer drinker, but my brother and friends are. The tacos are outstanding with a very authentic taste. My personal favorite is the Pork Taco Al Pastor and the Chicken Tinga Taco. The chips and salsa are some of my favorite in town. The wait staff and bartenders are pretty awesome and I have never had a bad time here. I highly recommend it to friends and family, and visit there about once a week these days. I've been for lunch, dinner and for drinks late. There's never a bad time to stop in. The beer is great, and I usually ask for a sample of the ones I don't know. They are always generous with the samples and usually recommend a good beer based on my tastes. I end up with something on the light side like a Maui Blonde, but my brother likes the Sucaba and darker beers from Firestone. The prices are very reasonable, unlike Aces and Ales which is similar but very pricey. Give it a try, I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a great taco place in vegas and this place hits the spot! Not the biggest fan of the grilled fish though."}
{"text":"Went here for a business lunch but it's very casual. The name of the place just made me laugh, very straightforward :) Place was busy but we were seated quickly and we had a large group. Menu had an extensive selection of tacos. We started off with some appetizers, the guacamole and ceviche. The guac was delicious. The ceviche was good, but even though I love everything in it, together it's not my thing.

Now for the tacos! These are typical hand or street tacos, so you'll want to order at least two to four. I had the Carne Asada, Chicken Asada and Shrimp Tacos. Every single one was amazing, with the shrimp being one of my all time favorite shrimp tacos.

Unfortunately, this business lunch did not include any beer, so I can't comment on that aspect other than to say the beer list was shorter than I expect, but looked well rounded. Until next time!"}
{"text":"My sales team and I came here for dinner and we had a great time.  The wait staff was great and the food was delicious. I ordered guacamole and chips for an appetizer.  I was hoping for homemade chips but they were from a bag.  The guacamole was good though.  I had a very tasty chicken empanada and a gigantic chicken burrito.  My favorite was the churro.  It was the best churro that I've ever had!  I will definitely be back again!  It's a great value for a lot of food."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here. I got the Baja fish and beer battered avocado. I would recommend both. Our waiter Frank was awesome! The churro is to die for"}
{"text":"Great al acarte tacos! Large group next to us were obnoxiously loud, standing up and bumping into our table because more people came to join them. We were a little bothered by it but it wasn't a big deal. The manager Manuel came to our table as we sat down to apologize for the group being disruptive. He bought us a round of drinks. The server Alan bought us shots. Even though we didn't want to complain in the first place, it's amazing that they recognized it and wanted to make sure we had a great experience when that wasn't their fault."}
{"text":"Food is delicious HOWEVER the service was horrible! I had to ask for a menu and even ask to order drinks! I would not recommend going here unless you have a lot of time on your hands and DO NOT sit at the bar."}
{"text":"I've come to this restaurant many times and made reservations multiple times as well. I wanted to start out by saying that I've never had any issue, until tonight. 

I made a reservation for my brothers graduation for 10 people at 7:30pm. We waited until 7:55. The waitress then told us that the tables were not cleared out and that we'd have to continue waiting. (People we're still sitting at one of our tables - they weren't even done eating yet) It's now 8:00 and I'm leaving the restaurant. 

It would have been great for someone to inform us that our 7:30 reservation wasn't going to happen. I find it unacceptable that we had to wait this long only to leave without being seated, especially since my elderly grandparents had to stand for that long in a crowded restaurant. 

So, if you need to make a reservation for a group of people, DONT call this restaurant. They'll keep you waiting and they don't care to inform you of what's going on."}
{"text":"Firstly, the artwork over the bar is great and worth having a cocktail under!

The variety of tacos, tequilas and beers are worthwhile. Everything is well worth a taste and I usually attempt to host a lunch meeting here while in Vegas.

This place can get fairly lively too; the later it gets the louder the patrons. Something to keep in mind when dining with children.

A couple areas to improve; the toilet, there's a pretty strong smell and cleanliness isn't up to par with the rest of the restaurant. This is a poor reflection on the kitchen. Customer Service, explaining the flavors on the menu could be a great for up sale and maybe a taco to cocktail recommendations could put this place over the top."}
{"text":"Really love this place!! Great food and service! Our server Justin was great very attentive."}
{"text":"Love the food.  I mean I LOVE LOVE LOVE the food here.  Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because as I was waiting to be seated, their Security Guard (yes, their Security, not someone coming in after work) was drinking a beer outside the open door."}
{"text":"If this is a franchise, you wouldn't know it.  Great place to mix in with the local service industry peeps without the work BS.  Tacos are on it - a dozen or more with specials all the time.  They know their beer, too, though I would like to see more lagers."}
{"text":"The name hits it home--yet there's alot to this place.

First off, the rotating beer selection is has a great variety. Their menu also features signature cocktails, all that I've tried have been excellent. The bartenders will help guide you to a selection if you need it!

The guac is awesome, slightly chunky just how I like it.

As for the tacos--top notch. Handmade tortillas really set them apart from other establishments. I've had 8 of them so far on the menu, each of them just as tasty as the last. I'm not picky, but if you are, I'm sure you could find something.

By the way, they make 4 different hot sauces and the bartender/server will arrange them from hottest to mildest.

GO HERE."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Perfect stop before heading out of town. Beer was cold and tacos even better. Frank our server knew the menu well and chatted us up appropriately."}
{"text":"You had me at \"Mezcal Old Fashioned\". Also at \"tacos\". I have eaten here a few times and enjoyed each visit. The barbacoa, and al pastor tacos are usually my go-tos, and both are delicioso. Last time, I ordered the veggie taco, and it was so tasty that I considered ordering at least a dozen more even tho I wasn't even hungry enough for the first one. *Hunger is of no concern when tacos are involved. The mango jicama salad is fresh and tasty and they have a unique selection of draft beers which is fun for those who like to explore outside of the Corona bottle. And ultimately, the best part is getting to sit outside, eating and drinking and good-timing, on the patio just like the good 'ol FF days."}
{"text":"This place had great food some of the best, and for the price I would it met my expectations for the price, I would go there again. The service was really really slow so if you are in a hurry then this is not the place for you it took me almost 2 hours to eat here"}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations ! Many of my friends had been here so I finally decided to give it a try. It's in a busy shopping area very close to the strip. We came around 9:00 and it was pretty busy. They had loud music playing which I didn't mind at all. We decided to take a seat at the bar and we did not regret it at all. The bartender made sure to take care of us very well. There was also a second bartender Jesus who was very helpful and even recommended a beer to try. 
I ordered three tacos and boy was that enough! The tortillas are hand made and a very decent size. I chose three different meats and they were all AMAZING! Being Mexican I didn't really expect much from the food here but I was wrong! The flavor is very rich and similar to authentic Mexican meat. 
My fiancé ordered there burrito with barbacoa and he absolutely devoured it! 
We also had some very yummy micheladas! 
Definitely will be coming back !"}
{"text":"Chicken tinga empanada is one of my favorites, its delicious, I love this place because the food its grate, and they always have a good selections on beers, the staff is friendly and attentive, besides the atmosphere is comfortable and it's perfect if you want to come with friends totally recommended"}
{"text":"Let me start with why i say said 4 before any one gets so worried.

I just did not like the background music. It just did NOT match the food... it felt like high school music, but maybe they put the music on purpose because they wanted us to leave. We did arrive right at last call... 

Besides that, the food was amazing. I did have a taco that did not have meat, and that was not my fav, but it wasn't bad haha. 

I had been here before and remembering i didn't like the flan, so i had the churros instead this time around, and it was YUMMMMMMYYYYY. 

So, i definitely do recommend this place if all you care about is food, and beers (because duh, tacos and beers) but I kinda picky about music... 

About the service... i believed they hated us when we first walked in. Probably thought we were just going to take our sweet time. But my husband and i have worked restaurants on the strip, so we understand last call. We were just hungry.... but they finally realized when we payed the check in like 30 mins from entering"}
{"text":"Excellent place for tacos! Go early because this place gets packed! The Cadillac Margaritas were f-ing tasty."}
{"text":"This place is great from the ambiance to the taste of the food/ beer selection. I wanted to give 4 stars because they used to have these amazing street tacos that they took off the menu and have no interest in bringing back (best thing on the menu and super popular so WHY!?!?!!) but I guess that wouldn't be fair. I'm assuming it's because they weren't as expensive as their gourmet tacos (their main menu) but were way more popular so they were probably losing money. I would come here again anyway though because everything else is great. Just wish they'd considered bringing those tacos back!!"}
{"text":"Out here for a convention and decided to get some Mexican food. Pulled out the old Yelp and found this gem. Small but open environment and the staff is just amazing. Very friendly and helped us through the menu. Lots of great beers. Most of the craft is in cans or bottles (wish they had more on tap). Food was absolutely amazing. I would recommend that if you order more than 2 tacos only order 2 ate a time. By the time I got to the 3rd it was getting cold. As for the food I ordered the chicken tinga* carne asada and the al pastor. Everything was cooked perfectly and were amazing. We also got the table side guac and tried the bacon and corn on top. You can never go wrong with more bacon in your life (minus the whole cancer thing). We will be coming back here soon on this trip and futures trips."}
{"text":"Hi Yelpers, this is my first review, and to be honest the first time I have been absolutely compelled to write a review. I only wish I had pictures to illustrate my point.

My story goes: I spent all night driving to Vegas with a jonesing for some tacos and I stumbled upon this spot. The ambiance, menu and staff were great (4.5 out of 5). Now the food was... horrible. The chips were stale (I dunno how that even happens?), and the tacos were uneatable. No flavor whatsoever, and the ingredients seemed a day old. The final straw was when I opened my al pastor taco and saw a single piece of cilantro! Just one piece! These cooks bestowed no pride or effort into making these tacos, I would have been better served at TacoBell (and I hate saying it). My only mistake was taking my food to go, or else I would have demanded my money back! I wish this restaurant well, and maybe they can turn it around but until then, stay away, far far away from this place. 

In a nutshell: The taco's are equivalent to cafeteria food, but the ambiance is great, and unless thats your thing don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Great spot! Definitely recommend! The tacos are amazing, the staff is friendly. Vibe is great and so are the people there"}
{"text":"First of all, we were certainly welcomed well from Miguel V. And we loved being checked on often even though we sat outside. We got chips and salsa and tacos and OH MY GOSH!!!! I wanted to order 3 tacos from the recommendations he gave me but ended up having one carne asada and one chicken and let me tell you I got super full even though I usually can eat. Very rich with guacamole, cheese, beans, pico de gallo and salsa and the tortillas were just amazing .. I honestly would have had more if I could.. I definitely recommend it and will come back on Tuesday. Tacos are only $2,50 each .."}
{"text":"I come here alot and I have to say that Frank is an amazing server! He is very quick with taking your order and his great personality made our group lunch more delightful. I usually don't leave a review, but I felt that Frank went above and beyond as our server and deserves to be recognize for his outstanding customer service. Thank you! - Pamela"}
{"text":"My wife and attended a major convention last week and we just wanted some good tacos like local and not in a over priced restaurant. She is a major critic being from LA, but now living outside of Philadelphia.  What a place!  Best tacos ever had.  Each one was an art..even on carnitas you could tell they grilled the meat to the smokiness. Met the manager and said, man this is a find.  He treated us to his mother's favorite flan.  Service excellent, food beyond great, pricing..nothing as good as in this price bracket.  Forget about all the over priced chain places and casinos.  This the real deal at a great price.  Price for two WITH drinks, a bargain."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love perfect tacos at 1am? These guys have a great happy hour and a cool atmosphere to catch up with friends in. Not very busy on the late night tip, but that makes it even more perfect for those \"we're hungry and don't want to spend a billion dollars on food\" nights near the strip.

My friend and I ordered the chicken tinga and barbacoa tacos, both of which where amazing. A real plus is that they are regular size tacos. No street minis here, so 2 filled me up quite nicely. Got some guac too, and it was perfect. Passion fruit margaritas hit the spot to wash it all down.

Service was great, even at closing time (2am). As a night owl who loves late dining, I highly recommend Tacos & Beer."}
{"text":"Three Vegan Tacos on the menu! I was impressed before I even took my first bite. They also had veggie options and a creative list of cocktails. It's a fun environment and reasonably priced. This place is getting bookmarked for sure. The great service was the cherry on top."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but the best part was the staff specially our server Mandy she is best server in Las Vegas!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I go here whenever I need a taco fix!  Definitely never disappoints.  Every friend that has visited and has ate here with me will agree!  Only have had their tacos and every. single. one. I looove.  Have a reasonable Happy Hour that no one could argue with."}
{"text":"I took my sister here to catch up with her and check out a new place as I'd heard through multiple friends of mine the food was good. 

The menu was just the right size, not too big, not too small, easy to order, and each dish we got was spectacular. 

The dishes themselves were the perfect size too, not too big, not too small, and everything flavored just right. 

Our server Frank was awesome, he went over everything to show us how the menu was laid out, what was in each dish, and his personal recommendations. 

He made the dinner that much better so a big thank you to Frank.

I highly approve!"}
{"text":"What a cool place to enjoy a few drinks and tacos on a night you just need to unwind and relax. I saw Melissa Y. check in here and I've always passed it while driving on Paradise so I thought hey why not give them a try. I can certainly say this is a young hipster-y vive of a Mexican joint. Can't exactly say the ambiance nor the food is your Abuela's authentic Mexican cooking, but a bit more Americanized and modern. I ordered the Baja fish taco, veggie taco with chips and salsa on the side. I enjoyed both tacos they were both pretty stuffed. The guac was a bit more \"whipped\" than I prefer, but once again this a modern fix on the tacos. This was all I ordered and it came out to $9 and some change. I was pretty full, so I did get my money's worth. I didn't order any drinks, but plan on doing so the next time I come. I sat at the bar and the bartender was okay for the most part but was just kind of whatever. I can't wait to come back here with friends to enjoy our selves."}
{"text":"Power packing selection of craft draft beers!  They offer 20 handles of fun, foamy goodness for your mouth.  Many of which really bring it in terms of ABV, so be careful because they can knock you on your butt in no time flat.  

The staff deliver fantastic, friendly service.  One night we were fortunate to sit down at the bar next to the manager, David, who is very friendly and eager to make sure that his guests have an outstanding experience on his watch.  

The food - this menu is small, but delicious and won't put a hurtin on your wallet.  They have a weekday happy hour and reverse happy hour that I've yet to try, but I'm highly looking forward to.  

In case ya didn't know, now ya know - it's locating in the old Firefly location."}
{"text":"I've been here many times with my husband, friends and family. The service was always mediocre, but both the food and margaritas have always been consistent. Today was different... it was AMAZING! We have Ciara as our server and she is a game changer for the restaurant. She understands what customer service is all about and it was so refreshing. So many servers have tunnel vision and are all about getting the guest in and out. She read our minds and understood we just wanted to do some drinking and hanging out. She let us tell her when we were ready to go. Thanks for starting our Saturday off GREAT and making it full of great margaritas. Look forward to seeing Ciara again!"}
{"text":"Cool environment. We sat outside and it was nice and comfortable. It was really busy, but it didn't take long to get a table. The tacos were good. We ordered almost every taco on the menu. The al pastor, shrimp, and lengua were my favorites. The Margaritas were poured just right and the come with this cool foaming salt on top. On tuesdays they do Techno Taco Tuesday. They play Techno music and after eleven is happy hour. Seafood tacos are $3. All other tacos are $2. Select Craft beers are $3. Margaritas are $4 and really good. Check it out you'll definitely have a great time. Date night or pre-game."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Be sure to get the chips and guac. Al Pastor was my favorite and my gf loved the Baja Fish taco.  If you like spicy order the grilled/fried jalapeños."}
{"text":"Where do I start?!? 
Service and food.. Wonderful!!!

First we ordered the ceviche, and the corn salad... Ceviche tasted fresh and full of flavor.. The corn was also so good and full of flavor. If you like corn I definitely recommend this. 

Next we ordered practically every taco on the menu and they were ALL amazing, fresh homemade tortillas as well.. My personal favorites were the fish taco and the baja fish taco. They were both so packed with flavor I couldn't decide which I liked better! By far some of the best fish tacos in Vegas, I'm also a huge fan of fish tacos... 
The carne asada, chorizo, chicken tinga were also yummy... 

We got churros for dessert and those were also to die for. 

Overall everything was amazing and we will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and atmosphere here. I sat at the bar, the bartenders were pretty good. When things got a little busy there weren't as quick/attentive, but that's to be expected. Food was really good, and came out fast which was great. I would definitely visit again. It's in an interesting location, but convenient and there was plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Frank was our server and he was awesome! The service was amazing and the margaritas are delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Thee best food and amazing drinks! Enjoyed the al pastor and the house margarita. Can't wait to return for reverse happy hour."}
{"text":"I love love this place and the bartender Stephanie makes its sooooo much better!! The tacos are so different buts delicious. I had the crunchy taco which had beef, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and......mashed potatoes yes I said mashed potatoes!!! It was delish. There are so many different tacos to chose from ad well as amazing avocado dip and cheese dip. The ceviche was amazing. I think they also have the best chips. Stephanie makes the absolute best drinks. Its super cheap too which is awesome! Definitely recommend this place for great food and a fun time!!"}
{"text":"5 Stars is not enough.  We've come to eat here many times usually on Taco Tuesdays.  Service is always great with zero complaints.  If anything isn't right with the food they fix it asap.  Now, the tacos.  Mouth watering right now as I think about the tacos I ate on this past Tuesday.  I had the Barbacoa, El Pastor and Chorizo tacos.  Melt in your mouth with explosive flavors.  It should be noted you can see a lady pressing tortillas inside the restaurant behind glass.   So that alone tells you they're fresh.  

I started with chips and salsa.  Fresh tasting warm and crispy tortilla chips.  The red and green lime cilantro sauce is a must.  

Drinks were micheladas that were on point with a Cadillac Margarita that was sweet and strong.  

Tacos and Beer is a must for those who visit and live here in Las Vegas.  Now for that person who has yet to find a taco place that's not white washed or fake Mexican made this is the place you will need.  

Back to the tacos.  Every single time they are packed with whatever meat you order.  It's all in the toppings and the preparation of the meats.  Consistently tasting amazing each visit.  

Techno Tuesday has a DJ with pretty loud music so if you're not into that go a little earlier in the day.  Do check out the happy hours because your entire meal is pretty cheap on Happy Hour.  Even without Happy Hour this place does not have the high Strip Prices.  

If I had a last meal, I would order tacos from here. - Miguel"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, service was quick and friendly, kid-menu and crayons to keep them occupied. It was a great dinner for our family while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos I've ever had!!! The \"rajas con creme\" and \"veggie\" are my favorite! The house margarita or red beer are the perfect compliment to these entrees. The service was amazing! The bartender even remembered me from a previous visit! Everyone was friendly and knowledgable of the menu and specialty drinks. The manager \"Chuy\" checked on me to make sure I was happy. The restaurant was clean and the seating very comfortable. They also offer outdoor seating under a covered patio. I would highly recommend this restaurant to my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Been here twice.  Off the strip taco bar with great atmosphere.  Marissa the bartender delivered great service with a smile.  Grilled mahi fsh tacos were fresh and perfectly cooked.  Freshly made corn tortillas.  Great salsas and chips.  Im coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Aayyyeeee!!! AMAZING ! Food/Drinks/Desert so on point! Had to come here twice during my visit. Definitely a place I will always come visit when I'm in Vegas! And i hope Frank serves us every time ! He's so funny and definitely tries to make sure we get everything we need! :) #ChorizoTacos"}
{"text":"places like this really make me wonder about yelp reviewers.  4 1/2 stars?  you have got to be kidding me.  these chefs know nothing about Mexican flavors.  started with guacamole (at least I thought I did.  it actually came out 5 minutes after my tacos).  the avocado wasn't quite ripe which made the texture somewhat unappealing.  it also lacked flavor.  I squirted a little lime juice in it which kinda helped.  as for the tacos, blah.  the famous crispy taco was pretty boring and the mashed potato was gag worthy.  the pork taco wasn't bad but at 4 bucks I'm gonna put it in the fail category.  finally, the barbacoa taco shared the same fate.  for a place that supposedly specializes in tacos, Imperial has a lot of work to do.  go try the lamb tacos at carson kitchen if you really want to be blown away.  and, they make their own tortillas.  almost forgot to mention the beer.  they were out of the one I wanted.  that fact, combined with the lack of front of the house service, and a mostly empty restaurant at dinner time, lead me to believe this place is in serious trouble."}
{"text":"Loved this place. We went for lunch on a Saturday the service was prompt and the food was delicious. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"been here a few times and I would love to go again. The tacos are reasonably priced and reasonably sized. I love that they have such a big variety of tacos to choose from. They have a corn appetizer that is delicious. Can't go without getting a jalapeno margarita!!!"}
{"text":"Giving it a 3 star for now. 
I like the location and decor. It's a great place! I came with high hopes to taste the food and wasn't disappointed. The bacon-wrapped  jalapeños are good! The beer list was long and extensive but a bit over priced for the place. 

The BIG disappointment I had was my michelada! As any Mexican knows, Micheladas are like our daily protein shake! The mix wasn't good at all. I asked for other sauces to fix the flavor and the bartender (nice girl) stated they didn't have any and all they could serve was the mix. I found it to be a big thumbs down. Definitely that should be looked into. Have Maggi, Wosteschire sauce etc.... 

Sucks to say but, the Micheladas at broadacres (Vegas swap meet) are more authentic then here. 

Great place but expensive tapas in this area. 

Review made 2/14/16."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I loved the nachos... Friendly atmosphere....The dessert flan is excellent..
Our waiter Alberto was superb..."}
{"text":"Top notch tacos, great service, great beer list, great prices. For off-strip fare this crushes it. Come and eat with no qualms."}
{"text":"Let's start with Alberto, my waiter  - extremely friendly, knowledgeable. .and I felt relaxed and welcome right away. 

He helped with the beer selection. ..and checked-in in a cool way. 

The tacos are very creative and tasty.  The atmosphere is super fun and the beers are killer!
Can't wait to come back with my wife. .."}
{"text":"Such an awesome atmosphere ! I found my new favorite spot. Service was amazing. Our server was Ruy  beyond friendly and very attentive . Overall I felt welcomed. Loved the holy trinity holding a taco. PLUS the music was on point ."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Seriously some of the best tacos I've ever had and they have something for everyone. Vegan tacos for me, vegetarian for my boyfriend, and plenty of ones with meat and cheeses in them for our friends! Whatever you want me up ordering here, you're going to love. (Although I highly recommend getting the jackfruit tacos even if you're not vegan or vegetarian)

Staff has always been super friendly here, drinks are great, and the atmosphere is wonderful as well. If you have a chance to, you need to head here!"}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for the first time 2 years ago and we heard about this place. On our 4 day business trip we ate dinner here 3 Times. Great selection of cocktails and beers. The draft selection is great with about 20 choices. Menu has some great choices of what you call \"street tacos\" made how you want it. Service is pretty quick and gets everything handled right away. The place is very clean and not too crazy. Good environment to have a business meeting and dinner. The guacamole is delish. So fresh and chunky. The margarita can be frozen or on the rocks. Good flavor choices. Tables are setup well and gives everyone ample room. Not too overcrowded.
The place is located in a small strip mall and has plenty of parking outside. There is also outdoor seating but not with a great view.  I don't think you'll need a reservation but if you suspect the area to be busy, be safe and call ahead"}
{"text":"Great micheladas and shots!  Good ambience, good crowd the tacos were decent.  More trendy, than actually great or worth coming back too."}
{"text":"\"Eh\". That sums it up. The beer was good but the restaurant didn't have much to do with that.  The food is way overpriced.  Didn't hate it. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"First thing's first...their tacos are delicious! Their \"crunchy\" taco is my favorite. The mashed potatoes they put in that taco is a perfect touch. The service was great as well. The last time I went here, it was pretty empty, so my friend and I stayed a little longer after we already paid...and our waiter refilled our waters. Never have I ever been to restaurant that continues to give you refills after you already paid. I thought that was nice."}
{"text":"First time here and I gotta say it was a good experience. Tacos were a good size and they were so good. They reminded me of the Tijuana tacos. The Micheladas are also good. We went around 5 pm and there was enough parking and we were able to get seated ASAP. Would recommend! And will be returning when I return to Vegas. :)"}
{"text":"Great beer list, excellent margaritas and tasty tacos. Good ambience even on a Tuesday night with a live DJ!

The only negative of this awesome taco place just off the Vegas strip was that my fish taco was really fishy but we are a ways away from the ocean where the Mahi Mahi was born... We'll definitely be back, maybe even this week."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Craft beers are my favorite and they have an amazing selection. Told Hank the bar tender/ GM  what I was in the mood for and knew the perfect beer to go with some killer tacos! I live in LA and I will drive to Vegas just to go back to this place."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! The wait staff was so helpful with explaining the menu and beer selections to make sure we got exactly what we wanted. Very fun environment and the food was delicious. They definitely don't short you on the portions!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Very impressed! Service was above and beyond and it was a TEAM effort. Our waiter answered questions I had about the menu in a prompt manner. The food was OUTSTANDING and well of course the beer was also . We will return on our next visit to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing best Tacos, Best Service, Best ambiance. 
It'd try the Cadillac Margarita and shrimp tacos! I come here all the time. My favorite night is Tecno Tuesday."}
{"text":"Outstanding staff, great beer selection, and awesome quality food.  Beer seleyis good for a quality beer snob as well and geeks and casuals. The food is prepared top notch.."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and location. The environment is welcoming and fun and I've always had a good experience every time I've been here. 
The shrimp tacos are the BOMB! Highly recommend checking it out, locals and tourists!"}
{"text":"Ehh, this place was just okay!

My best friend and I ordered:
Guacamole and chips - Which was pretty good
Shrimp taco - Which was decent but the shrimp was small
Carnita taco - They put too much sauce I couldn't even finish it
Crunchy chicken taco - Which was really good
Al pastor taco - Which was really good
Lengua taco - It was ok, nothing special
Carne asada fries - Horrible. I'd rather go to Robertos lol
Churros - The churros had flan in them which was pretty good. 

I still don't get what the whole fuss is about this place. Maybe they just come here for the live dj and late hours. lol No offense to the business. Service was great but the food was a little disappointing. I'd come back just for the guac and chips and churros haha and we'll probably go get tacos somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in town to get some serious brews and amazing tacos! I've been coming here almost from it's opening a couple years ago and it's a great place to hang with friends afterwork if you work near the strip and want some \"non-touristy\" real food. Make sure to ask for the home-made salsas to enhance your tacos...from HOT HOT HOT to mild green they kick ass. The staff is also the greatest, if you're lucky you'll get to have Frank take care of you, I mean they're all great but Frank brings fun happy service to a primo level.

Thank You Tacos & Beer for doing what you do and doing it right!"}
{"text":"Craving Mexican food I knew that something had to be close especially with the wonderful array of choices here. The Envy Hotel that I am
staying out recommend Ed this location, besides me already being aware of it. I have always wanted to try Tacos and Beer, so here I am. I know in my own experiences that tacos go especially well with beer. This establishment is no different, since their tacos are amazing. The style and feel of the restaurant is so laid back bar type cool. I am surprised that they don't have pool tables, this seems to be what they lack. One can dream of course. This is a sit down restaurant with very amazing murals and paintings surrounding the guest. The service is stellar. The music is upbeat and in English which is something I like since it is old school rock from the 90s and it takes me back to the old days. 

The alcohol choices that they provide from the bar are exceptional. Their prices for example on mezcal vary from $11-40. So it is nice to see the various variations of alcohol choices from low to high; and the in between too. I ordered Coors Light since I wanted to taste how the beer would pair with their carne asada tacos. The soft tortilla shells on the tacos are larger than that of street tacos and they taste so good. These tacos melt in your mouth in essence and pair well with beer.

I am a real big fan of green chili's so as an appetizer I tried the green chili's with cheese and held the chili sauce. The chili sauce is hot but I feel that it ruins the cheese filled green chili's. Dessert was something that the twins wanted so I ordered them the dessert tacos. These dessert tacos are waffle style cones shaped like taco shells with chocolate on it and vanilla ice cream inside . On top of the ice cream is chocolate and Carmel sauce . These dessert tacos pair well with beer too. What a wonderful restaurant to come and eat great Mexican and have a moving experience with beer."}
{"text":"We came here about a month ago late afternoon because we were in the area and a friend recommended this place.  The bar was full I think it was happy hour,  but because I am pregnant we sat in the very empty dining room. We love the beer selection and the ambiance.  I really wanted to give this place more stars because the food was actually excellent.  We had nachos,  tacos and tortilla soup... All were great! The service was pretty bad I must say.  At first both out orders came out wrong.  My nachos were missing meat and my husbands tacos were made with onions which he had told the server he wanted no onions, and if it hadn't been for the busser,  who also sat us at our table,  we would have had a much worse experience.  I wish I knew his name so I could give him the props he deserves.  He ran all our food and brought us everything we needed, including drink refills and also fixed the server's mistakes with our food.  When the server actually came to the table he didn't even acknowledge or apologize that our orders came out incorrect and just pretended like nothing had happened.  He had a completely careless attitude about his job. I give this place three stars because of the attentiveness of the busser who took care of us so our whole experience wouldn't be a flop,  and for the excellent food.  If our experience would have been handled differently by our server I would have given it five stars."}
{"text":"I really don't like to leave negative feedback but today they ask for it.. start with chips and salsa they forget to bring it before the taco,, it's ok this is not big issue!! I did order some food to go. To be picked up when we're don eating! So we finish eating and we have to wait for another 30 minutes for the 3 tacos to go.. I can't even believe it take 5 minutes to tab 3 tacos."}
{"text":"I used to visit this establishment when it was the original Firefly, the transition to Tacos & Beer is a great one..I'm a fan..

Tacos & Beer service:  Excellent service throughout our visit.  Our server was so on it with checking keeping the beers fresh and suggesting ones to try.  On a packed Saturday night, the kitchen got our tacos to us pretty quickly.

Tacos & Beer, Tacos:  They have so many different tacos (20+?) on the menu and I love it!  You can order them individually to personalize your own taco combo.  I went with the Carne Asada, Beef barcoa, and the Crunchy.  My favorite was the Crunchy.  It was a traditional taco (ground beef,lettuce, pico, sour cream, hot sauce, cheddar, etc) but was very tasty.  The Carne asada was very good but the Beef Barcoa was a little too salty for me.  All in all, this was a great taco experience.

Tacos & Beer Ambiance:  The ceiling is adorned with individual candle lights and makes for a very cool look.  A Cheech and Chong mural is showcased at the bar and the there church influenced murals throughout the building.  Lots of dark wood matched up with this make for a very attractive dining area.  

This place gets really busy and I understand why as they deliver in Service and their food. There will definitely be future visits as I'm looking to sample more tacos, but that's another Yelp tale.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food is great, but what the hell man. The Chocolate Tacos waffle cones are much smaller. Sad day in America. #makechocolatetacosgreatagain"}
{"text":"Been here several times and really enjoy this place. The only complaint would be the service has been a little slow(not enough to stop me from growing back). Great selection of food and beer.  Prices are great too (Half price beer for happy hour). 

I've tried most of the tacos on the menu and my favorites have been Chicken Tinga & Puerco Verde.  Their Guacamole, corn salad, and cilantro lime rice are great too."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch time. Located a little bit off the strip. Kind of hidden. Ordered up the barbacoa and lengua tacos. Not bad. The hot sauces they provide are a bit mediocre. Chips and salsa are mot complimentary. Order came with charred jalapeños. Some were mild and some were super spicy. So watch out."}
{"text":"Started off thinking it was going to be a one star meal as the ginger hostess tried to cram us in the corner with tables surrounding it full of people when half of the restaurant was empty made no sense I confronted her she rolled her eyes and move us to another table .

Our server was Alyssa (I fell in love immediately )thought she did a great job my friend didn't like her shrimp nachos but I thought my tacos were pretty damn good"}
{"text":"My gal pal and I tried this place out for the first time today and I was blown away. Their lengua is tender, delicious and so flavorful! Best lengua I've ever had. The atmosphere is fun and inviting, music is great! And the service is amazing! Mandy was our server and she did such a great job. She was very informative and super attentive. She definitely added to our already wonderful experience. I will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Good easy location, awesome tacos, a great selection of beers and the patio seating was perfect! Good service and good prices. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Luis was incredible the food was amazing I will have to come back here every day now that I am aware it exists. The patio is so quaint and the music is fabulous. I can't even handle the salt they use on their margaritas. I am shook. Please give these people your money because the experience alone is worth it! A round of applause is necessary!"}
{"text":"This is pretty straight to the point. They have great tacos and they have great beer. This is for tastes beyond Taco Bell and Bud Light. 

Tacos: Shrimp taco. That's a must. You'd be a fool to skip it. Lengua is always a crowd pleaser. Pork al Pastor was one that I wasn't sure would work, but it definitely did. It's marinated pork taco with avocado cream / pineapple / and achiote. I did not and still don't have a great understanding of achiote. All I know is that, it helped make this taco taste amazing. Not sure you can go wrong with any of the tacos there.

&

Beer: I had the DirtWolf (Imperial IPA) by Victory Brewing and 1000 IPA by Mikkeller. Both pack a hell of a punch. The 1000 IPA was not as bitter as you would think and it wonderfully warms your soul. Nothing helps also warm that soul too than some fantastic Mexican food. Mexican soul food. Nothing better."}
{"text":"The tacos are phenomenal!!!The dessert-flan is amazing!!! Jen and Armando provided exceptional customer service"}
{"text":"Best. Place. Ever!!

This spot was once a hang for my girl and I when it was called another name. I wasn't sure what to expect when it became a new establishment. On a whim I took my band mates there last night for a real chill hang. It also happened to be Happy Hour (we showed up around 12:30 am) 

First, we were totally welcomed by great great staff. . Super nice, informative on beer selection and food options. Staff A+ 

I am a big fan off unique beers AND THEY'VE GOT EM! Beer A+ 

The decor in this place blew me away! Completely different and way way better than the \"old place\" Vibe and Decor A+

FOOD!! These tacos were grand. And I was happy to see at 1 am they would put great effort into a well made taco. Fresh, tasty and with an awesome presentation. FOOD A+

I will be back religiously. Thank you to the staff (sorry can't recall names =o) for being gracious and welcoming!

Go To Tacos & Beer!

{"text":"Tacos and beer!! It's that simple.

Located along Paradise Rd and a little past East Twain, Imperial Tacos and Beer is situated in a decent sized strip mall across from Marrakech. If you are local, it's where the old Firefly was located.

I'll start by saying this: Don't fill up on starters. The Guac crab and mango starter is great but is filing.

The tacos here are great, sampling variety from Crunchy to Baja Fish but the one the I can recommend is the Verde Pastor. Plenty of flavor with an interesting combo of ingredients. The servings are a little bigger than your regular street tacos so don't worry you won't be hungry later.

The beer selection is extensive. The menu has most of the beers broken down into simply categories that are easy to follow. If you want an updated beer menu check the blackboard beside the bar.

As for the service, our busser and host were awesome. The busser took our orders and recommend different tacos. The sever wasn't really around that much.

The hostess was amazing, she had a very extensive knowledge of beer and was amazing in recommending. Management better change her to the bar or someone is going to scoop her up!

Overall
Food: 4-5
Drink: 4-5
Service: 3-5
Coming back: yes"}
{"text":"The tortilla soup was very good and the corn salad. I didn't care for the AL pastor tacos they were not very authentic or flavorfull.  The enchiladas were very bland.  My daughter's really liked the flan though, oh and the quest fundido was quite good."}
{"text":"Came to this place after a long day of Climbing. It was highly recommended and now I see why. There was plenty on indoor and outdoor seating and had a cool vibe to it. Great place to watch a game. The menu was awesome! Over 10 different taco options to mix and match and also a giant burrito and more. They have a large beer menu, however when we visited, they were all out of Mexican draft beer, which we were in the mood for, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. Friendly staff, good food, at reasonable prices. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good taco bar."}
{"text":"Wow. 
SO...Finally getting a chance to write about this spot since the change over from Firefly. Ok, here's what was good. The food tasted right, nothing muddied in the flavors and clean executions with seasoning. \"Mexican\" style food can often get a lil crammed in with too much going on. You can tell that quality marinades, and proper prep work went into the grub here. The beer selection is really good. Always a steady rotation of quality beer and good drinks. 

Here's what's often not good : the service. I have actually had servers that have been employed there since it was the previous restaurant - Firefly - tell me that they were new employees. They did this because they had forgotten orders. Not ordered our food .. And in one event, the server was dancing in front of the Dj while we waited for our check for over 15 minutes. 

Telling the manager about the issue did nothing. The manager was combative with us trying to defend the servers mistakes when we asked for nothing other than the check.  The tall Latino, male night manager we dealt with, went so far as to lie and say we had been using profanity against the server - as if to say that any other mistake made by the server - was invalid. No such thing happened. 

I want to support local business and I wanted to be a regular diner at this establishment. That kind of behavior is unacceptable. 

So if you go check it out - maybe lunch is a better option. Happy eating to you !!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and afraid to say I won't be returning.brought my co worker after a long day with high hopes, just to be let down. They were really busy. Our server was short\rude with us after we explained to him how we didn't like our ceviche. Before that, When we got our tacos they were really cold. The hostesses need more training on how to greet guests as they're coming and leaving."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. \"Meh\" sums up the entire experience. Food was meh, service was meh. My favorite part was the tomatillo salsa. I had the carne asada taco and the pineapple black bean taco. The carne asada didn't have much flavor at all. My husband ordered the flautas, which looked delicious but were just ok and mushy. The food is affordable, about $3/taco. I can't see us coming back here."}
{"text":"The Tacos here are pretty good. The meat actually taste like authentic Mexican style marinate and grilling. We tried the carne asada, chicken asada, pork al pastor, and shrimp. The taste of the food was mouth watering. The guac was tasty and the chips tasted home made too. Beer selection was excellent and not to pricy (some beers). The environment was modern and chill. We went on a Saturday night around 8pm and it was not busy at all. We used the groupon deal so we saved quite a bit of money. Without groupon deal I do think the tacos are a bit pricy. 

CONS: 
Due to it not being busy what so ever it did take a bit of time to our drinks, but once our drinks came it went by quickly. 

The portion of guac is way to small to share with another person, it should be a tad bit bigger. 

They give you a slice of lime per taco but the limes did not have any juice in them. 

We had ordered a Lambic Framboise beer thinking it was going to be a regular sized or on draft,  it came out to be $24 for the beer which is way to over priced for that type of beer. 

Overall good experience will be coming back."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. This place is great!

I was not sure what to expect with a name like 'Tacos and Beer'. But this place has class. I am guessing by the name that this place is for the guys. When the hostess was a beautiful young woman, it was really starting to seem like that was the case. 

That is where it ended though. The entire staff was very outgoing, well trained, professional and attentive. The attention to detail here was excellent. We ordered the guacamole, and it was excellent. Freshly made and so flavorful. The tacos are outstanding. 

My husband's boss was in from out of town, and they all came here for lunch. It was such a hit, they went back the next day. Finally, we both went on our own.  
This is the perfect place to take a group of friends, have a nice lunch with your honey, or have a casual business lunch. I am for sure coming back."}
{"text":"Ok place , not a very extensive beer selection especially Mexican beer, beer is pricey. Food was Ok Tacos won't recommend to go as a place to eat or drink. Mostly a tourist place high prices and cheap"}
{"text":"Tacos & Beer is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. I love the Baja Fish Tacos and Shrimp Tacos! The guacamole is really good too! Try their frozen mango margaritas, they come in a regular water glass... But it is so good! The only thing that is not excellent is that I've gone there a few times late night on a Friday or Saturday and they were understaffed, so it took awhile for our server to get to us. Being open till 2am is a plus for anyone looking for a late night bite!"}
{"text":"5 star for food-3 star for service=4 star because of good management. 

As someone who doesn't eat meat or cheese it is generally pretty hard to find a place with good tacos. Yes, there are places that offer meatless tacos, but they aren't always good. Come on-- no one wants to eat just a tortilla with a few fillers. Tacos are supposed to be all about the vibrant flavor of a simple comfort food. When I found Tacos & Beer while preparing for a Vegas trip, I was thrilled to find out that they offered vegan options. My husband and I added it to the top of our list of places to go.

As soon as we made it to Vegas, our first destination turned out to be here. I was pleasantly surprised to walk into the coolest taco space that I've been. You can find candle holders hanging from the ceiling, sweet decor, and friendly faces. 

I started my visit here by ordering the chips and salsa. Yes-you do have to pay for it, but the salsa is soooo damn good. It's most definitely worth the $3. Our order arrived shortly after ordering. As soon as the plate was served, I had the most beautiful sight looking back at me. 3 perfectly plated vegan tacos were right before my eyes. They include a grilled pineapple and black bean taco, jackfruit carnitas, and beer battered avocado. My husband and I already started discussing when we could plan to come back again during our trip.

Unfortunately, our next visit was NOT so great. We arrived with two other friends but decided to order our food to-go instead of waiting for a table. This wasn't a problem at all because we only cared about the food, not where we were going to eat it at. All 4 of us ordered our food and then stood by the door to wait for it. After a few minutes, my husband and I decided to go snag two seats at the bar because we were exhausted after a long day. Immediately the bartender(Karen or Kerri) rolled her eyes and demanded that we give her our ID's. As we were getting our ID's out, I smiled and let her know that we had just ordered food to go and that we wouldn't be ordering any alcohol because we don't really drink. She immediately got an attitude and told us that if we weren't ordering a drink that we couldn't sit there and would need to get up for someone else. I was shocked! My husband and I travel to many places to try new restaurants and do reviews and NEVER have we been told that we can't sit at the bar and need to give up our seats for someone else. I'm really hoping that this wasn't because we are an interracial couple. There were other seats at the bar, the bartender was still able to make money, and she was busy anyway. I'm not sure what the issue was, but this is totally unacceptable. As soon as the next couple sat down, she had a beaming smile and loudly welcomed them. 

We requested to speak with a manager and the other staff members quickly worked to try to resolve the problem. The manager was at the sister location so we opted for a phone call instead. My husband and his friend (a Local) both talked to the manager on duty who was incredibly nice and apologized for the incident. They offered us a credit for a future visit, but we opted to not use it since it wasn't the businesses fault but an employees. It seems that the manager and other staff members do care about the customers. Overall the food here is amazing, but the service the 2nd visit really made us change our view."}
{"text":"GO FOR TACO TUESDAY!! Great happy hour too :) The best thing on their menu is any kind of fish taco... Baja or Grilled!"}
{"text":"Really great vibe in this restaurant. Decor on the inside is really nice and really gives this place a nice look. 

Our service was fast and prompt. The waitress was on top of it and the bus boy and staff were constantly on top of filling our drinks and asking us if we needed anything. HUGE selection of beer and cocktails. I had nachos and they refilled it for free, as well as 3 different taco's which were good, a little messy but good. The Ceviche was awesome and I definitely recommend it to everyone who hasn't had ceviche. What really sealed the deal was the Churro dessert! it was an amazing twist on a classic for me and it was amazing and tasty. Especially the Horchata Ice Cream. 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Saw Tacos & Beer on Facebook interested in trying. Stopped by on a Saturday, pretty steady Kaylee was our server. Food was a little slow but customer service made up for it!"}
{"text":"Eat here! 

Came here today for lunch with a friend and our kids. I'd been wanting to try this place after driving past it a few times. It was pretty empty for lunchtime on a Saturday so we sat right down. 

I ordered 3 different tacos: beer battered mahi mahi, pork with pineapples, and a crunchy beef taco with mashed potatoes (yes mashed potatoes). All were amazing but my fav was the pork. It was difficult to narrow it down to just three tacos so I'm definitely coming back for the rest. 

Do not leave here without getting the churros! Next time I'm eating those first. Came with a chocolate dipping sauce and some fresh whipped cream...I almost died it was so good. 

The kids ordered the quesadilla that came fried, they weren't too excited about it and the waiter noticed this without us saying a word and brought out a regular quesadilla on the house for each of them. Overall the service and the food was wonderful! Already planning my next visit."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Best \"guera\" (American) taco ever. Among the best carne asada ever. First lengua I've ever had (delish, need more).

Granted, I grew up in Ohio. 

But I've had several thousand American tacos, and none better than this. Surprise twist: mashed potatoes. Verdict: Why didn't I think of that?

Carne asada was, no joke, top 3. Best ever was from a truck in Nogales Arizona. Second best was El Camino, Columbus Ohio (of all places). But now the two-spot is Tacos and Beer. 

I feel like you can tell a lot about somebody by how they introduce themselves. Tacos and Beer didn't reveal in name or locale, but my inquiry was well rewarded."}
{"text":"I liked my first outing here, the tacos were quite tasty and they have a great variety of beer. 

Staff was friendly and attentive. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"This spot is a hidden gem the food
Was so tasty and the service was amazing our server frank was such a knowledgeable pleasant funny amazing server definitely will be back and recommend this place to people"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we ran into people we knew that suggested we get the guacamole with the pomegranate and said it was an orgasm in your mouth, so we ordered that expecting the same. However, our waiter was too busy and just gave us the plain version so I was super disappointed that I couldn't experience the amazing food! Bummer."}
{"text":"Love the food here.  This is our second time here and AGAIN everything is awesome . Margaritas were wonderful  as well"}
{"text":"First time here.  Had the carne Asada taco and the carnita taco.  Both were very good.  I have had better of each as well.  Ordered the cilantro lime rice and the charro beans for sides.  The rice was fabulous.  The charro beans were good, but again, I have had better.   I had the guacamole with chips to start.  Have only had comparable guac at Frontera.  It was the best part of my meal!"}
{"text":"We took a detour from the usual Jersey Mike's lunch today and ended up next door at the newly opened Tacos and Beer.  5 stars for a taco place!?  Yeah yeah, I'm breaking my own rule that no place that serves everyday food should get more than 4 stars but the extra star is to keep this place going so I can come back for lunch over and over.  

The tacos are excellent...not as big as a \"Los Tacos\" taco but very tasty.  Definitely an artisan concept as other reviewers say.  Everything we tried was complex in ingredients and flavor (as much as you can pack into a street taco sized portion).  Our table tried out almost all the tacos on the menu and there was an overall preference for the various pork tacos but they were all good.

Service was fantastic but we need to go back to re-review as traffic was light today and it seemed all the staff was focused on a few tables.  Hope more people start going so they can continue to do well.
  
Definitely looking to go back after work to try all the beers....oh yeah...the tomatillo salsa was the best I've had in a while."}
{"text":"I'm a super fan of authentic Mexican tacos, and some people might consider this place \"Americanized.\" I really enjoyed my meal here, and was pleasantly surprised by the presentation, the quality of food, and everything that came along with it including the service and decor. Thank you Groupon for bringing me to this place, because I seriously gave up on finding decent Mexican food in vegas. 

The guacamole was probably one of top 2 best guacs of my life. It was fresh and flavorful. 

I love their chips. It has a great texture, and it's my favorite kind of chip. I don't know if it makes sense, but I hate it when I can smell old oil or taste it in my chips when they haven't changed it in a while. Not here. 

Baja fish (beer battered Mahi Mahi) tacos- 3 star. 
Shrimp tacos - 4 star. 
Carne Asada tacos- 4 star. 
Beef barbacoa- 2 star. 
Guacamole - 5 star.
Corn salad- 4 star.
Refried Beans with Chorizo - 1 star.  BEANS and CHORIZO! Doesn't that sound amazing?  I was sold by the description but it had a lot of chili powder or some spice in it that was overpowering. I couldn't really appreciate the flavor at all. 
Service- 5 star. They were on point most of the time. I did have to ask for some refills on my soda, but, it's all good. 
Ambiance- 5 star. 

I'm a bit confused as to how I'm giving this 5 star after seeing my average up above of each item. I think I was thoroughly impressed with the guac, chips, ambiance, and service. I also loved their flour tortilla (made to order) that they use for the tacos. Presentation of the tacos reminded me of China Poblano (at the Cosmopolitan) so it has this \"fancy\" feel to it without having to pay $4.50 for a taco. 

I think the Groupon deal made this place worthwhile too, considering that we paid almost half of what the dinner was worth. I will definitely be back to try other tacos on the menu next time!"}
{"text":"Tacos and Beer, I'm sorry I misjudged you. I expected a grungy loud bar with forever in college frat boys, but I was wrong. Tacos and Beer is a cute, chic restaurant/bar that is perfect for a cute date night or even a family dinner. The music is soft so you easily have a conversation and is appropriate for group get togethers. 
We started with the frozen margaritas. Mango, strawberry and passion fruit were all amazing. The passion fruit was slightly sweet, more sour. They were small, not very strong. For $9 they were a little too juicy, not enough drunk for me. 
Bacon wrapped jalapenos!!!! The jalapenos were stuffed with cream cheese, had the seeds they out so NOT spicy and were amazing. I highly, highly recommend them. 
I ordered 3 tacos and that was pretty filling. I was pretty basic and got the carne asada, beef barbacoa and baja fish. The baja fish was the BEST. Best fish tacos I've ever had- next time I'm ordering 3 of these. They were stuffed and the fish was so thick, breaded lightly and perfect. None of that all breading, little meat stuff you get at other taco joints. This was a FAT fish. 
I'll come back for date night, I'll come back for family night. 50cents off per taco for Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Its the best place for tacos. Busy all the timee. They have huge beer collection. Great  atmosphere. One should must visit if ur in vegas"}
{"text":"Best tacos and service I have ever had! I highly recommend this place!! A definite must visit when in Vegas!! We need one of these in the Bay!!"}
{"text":"Poppin' place, probably because it was Saturday and its close to the strip and the place is nice. They have a huge taco selection, they are $3-$4+  for regular size tacos, staff is alright, expect to wait to get seated or to get your food when its packed. The tacos are not amazinglyyyyy good, I know they have specials during \"Taco Tuesday\" but it probably gets packed. If you are going on a date or birthday dinner and are craving tacos, this can be the place, other than that you can just go to the \"usual\" taco spots."}
{"text":"Great food shrimp tacos are the best and the veggie one I hated the beer tart ass beer"}
{"text":"Tacos & appetizers are so good here! Been here twice already and I will definitely be back a lot more! Happy hour is amazing: 3pm-6pm & 11pm-2am It's not your street size tacos, they are a full sized taco. Chill ambiance."}
{"text":"Just for the bacon cream cheese jalapeños they get 3 stars...omg,,,it was soooo beyond delicious. The tacos was okay, I had better tacos in California, but they certainly out done the bacon cream cheese jalapeños. I think they should change their name to Jalapeño & Beer.....Next time when I am in Town, I will only order 4 orders of the Jalapeño & eat them as a meal, omg it was good....still drooling thinking of them."}
{"text":"AWESOM!!!   Great food, great beer and great service. Fresh made tortillas!!!!  The freshest fish tacos!!!  Corn salad was great along with the black beans!!!   Will eat there the next time!!!   Cool place to go.  Nice selection of bees!!!!!   And reasonable prices!!!!   Get off the strip and EAT there!!!"}
{"text":"There are two types of people who go to Las Vegas - those who are content with the same crappy chain restaurants they have in their town, and then those who want an awesome taste experience.

The latter should go to Tacos and Beer for awesome food, a great beer selection, fun decor, and friendly, attentive staff."}
{"text":"Tacos are the bomb!!!!! And we got jalapeño margarita highly recommend. We really enjoyed our food YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food tacos are very delicious. 
I go after work since I'm off so late so I stop by to eat only stoped making this a hangout spot because service is always so horrible I understand I get it I work in food and beverage hospitality also but the girl bartender always seems so annoyed if you ask for anything and the bartender takes way to long to get one !!! Drink order or even any order he has friends dining with him the times I go he put all of them before other guest which is fine but I wish he would acknowledge his other customers instead of hanging out with his friends letting them taste every tequila on the menu while he is working so annoying  I refuse to go in this place again I'd rather go to fireflys next door food is great and staff is at least attentive"}
{"text":"The location is easy to find with ample parking. We were seated immediately. The restaurant wasn't overcrowded. I would say the service was 8 out of 10 from the wait staff. The chips and salsa were good as well as the homemade corn tortillas. The food overall was delicious but they are really heavy handed with the salt. The mole sauce wasn't sweet but really salty. I would come back but maybe ask them to hold the salt or maybe it was the kitchen. Not sure."}
{"text":"Love Tacos & Beer. Everything is fresh. Especially the tortillas made right in front of you by a couple of ladies. Salsa is tops in town. And the beer selection is rad. Going tonight for the fish tacos!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night.  A friend of mine was DJ'ing there. The atmosphere was very casual and cool. Deco was definitely a convo topic at out table. All good remarks. Waitress came by and we weren't ready to order so she huffed off. 20 minutes later she showed back up with even more attitude and was really bothered when a friend asked about the desserts  (which aren't on the menu). I ordered a soup and when she came back with the soup and my soda her response was \"I lost your straw\" and never came back with a new one. I had to track the waitress down just to pay my $10.00 bill (soup and soda). I could totally understand if she was busy with tables since she was the only waitress BUT she had like 3 other tables besides us. I will give this place another try. Hopefully the wait staff gets better."}
{"text":"So yummy! We went for happy hour and got a pitcher of skinny margaritas for $28, I got the Baja fish tacos which are beer battered fish with a creamy slaw- delicious!!!! Also they quite a few veggie options. My boyfriend had the 3 meat tacos that were on happy hour and said they were great! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I checked out this place new years day.  Amazing!  I finally found a place that knows how to make a perfect Tortilla Soup, it was nice and spicy.  I also loved the taquitos, which at many places is burned inside and out or dry.  They put a yummy coitja cheese on top, very flavorful. I wish this place existed in Phoenix :(.  At least I can visit when I'm getting down in Vegas.  Oh and the tacos are good as well!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and atmosphere. Came here for happy hour and it was great. Two people chips salsa, tacos, and drinks for $16. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas and met some local girls who invited me out to dinner at this location for \"Taco Tuesday\". First the beer selection is beautiful and its truly a local place. They have a full bar as well and its a really great little party spot. They had a huge TV while the World Series was going on so it was a great atmosphere, almost sports-barish.
On to the food:
They had a great menu with everything Mexican with an American touch. The tacos were great and the enchiladas were among the best I've had. If you're a craft beer fan then this is a must stop for a calm location away from the strip."}
{"text":"Went here last Tuesday with friends that were visiting in town. Fun atmosphere and on Tuesdays they have a DJ out on the patio as well as $.50 off all the tacos! The tacos run $3-4/each normally and were pretty good. The roasted corn w/ poblano and the baja fish tacos were my favorites. We pretty much tried all of them. Can't speak for the beer selection since we decided to get pitchers of margaritas since we had already had a few before the restaurant. The pitchers of margaritas were a great price at $32/each giving about 5-6 margaritas each. Would def recommend trying out this place."}
{"text":"So pleased with the food here! I come here at least 3 times a week. Love everything about this place. Always giving superb customer service. 
The waiters are attentive and so chill! 
Shout out to Alberto for taking car of us..."}
{"text":"We ate here while traveling.  I had purchased a Groupon and we got a huge amount of food: yummy guacamole with chips, 6 tacos, 2 sides, and we ordered beer from the happy hour menu. We ordered the tacos our waitress recommended and they were really good: fish, crunchy, and pork with 2 sides: rice and corn salad.  We loved it all.  The food came quickly.  We'd eat here again and especially would come during happy hour."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch instead of Jersey Mike's. I regret it. It took 30 minutes to get five tacos. There were barely any other customers in the restaurant and we sat for that long. I ordered two bean and cheese tacos, they didn't come with half the ingredients the menu listed.

Also, be prepared to pay $6 for Tecate.

For those prices, you're better off anywhere else. The food didn't taste great, it was severely over-priced, missing key ingredients, and took much longer than necessary.

Patrons beware."}
{"text":"Service was good. Tortilla chips and tortilla soup were fair but the chicken tinga tacos were delicious. Refried beans portion was too small for the price. Overall, we had a decent experience and would go back."}
{"text":"Tacos & Beer had an awesome Groupon for chips & guacamole, two sides, and six tacos. I went to try it out for the first time with my boyfriend, and it was more than enough food. 

I enjoyed the guacamole and chips as a starter. The guac had a nice hint of lime, and the server was really great at refilling our chips. I ordered the shrimp, baja fish, and al pastor tacos. The seafood tacos were flavorful, and my boyfriend, who doesn't fancy seafood much, helped me finish my baja taco. I loved that the al pastor had pineapple chunks it. The only little downside was that it was a little saucy for my liking. 

Overall, the food was amazing, the portions were great, and the service was on point. I definitely will be coming back again, and I'm looking forward to checking out the happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas. The service is really good. Everyone is very attentive and experienced. We were served by Orlando. It was incredible how knowledgeable he was when it came to vegan/gluten free food. He helped us a lot with our choices and was very educated and polite. I highly recommend this place if you want to eat very tasteful Mexican food (except on Tuesday when they have a DJ playing and its usually packed)."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 8 people , and talked to the hostess and came in to the restaurant only to find out that they did not have a table available and didn't know when they would . Clearly seems like no one knows what they are doing . We were trying to show out of town friends a good time and it was embarrassing. Will not return ."}
{"text":"I have to agree with several of the recent reviews; service was spotty, flavors were fine but muddled and several things all tasted the same. Exceptions that stood out were the jalapeño poppers and the queso fundido."}
{"text":"These are the best tacos I've had thus far in Vegas. Not to mention the incredible assortment of beers to go along with it. Justin was a great server and had excellent recommendations. Overall a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"This wonderful place never fails to make my mouth happy. We always puck and share the different tacos. I would say that the shrimp and Carina's taco choices are hands down my favorites. 
The crunchy beef is interesting as it has mashed potatoes in it. Tasty and one of the people in our group would say it's her favorite.
The beer!! Oh it's great. I love sitting at the bar with chips and their various hot sauces....just trying all the different types on tap. I think it's usually 20 awesome unique types...the bartenders are always helpful in choosing different types based on personal preferences of the consumer.
I go at least once every time that I'm in Las Vegas.  They have never dissapointed."}
{"text":"I had my family come here for dinner on my birthday and we had a reservation for 15 people. We ended up having a few more than expected and they reasonably accommodated.

Our server was Noehmi and she was exceptional. She took care of every individual at our table. The entire restaurant was busy too. All the tacos and other dishes came out in order, and to the correct people. There was a mix up with a taco that was carne asada instead of Pollo but it was returned correctly in reasonable time. 

Some thing I will mention is they do not split checks, but will accept multiple payments. 

Drinks I would like to mention is their Hefeweizen beer & tequila sangria. 

My favorite tacos are the Jack Fruit Tacos, Crunchy Pollo (I THINK it had chicken lol) Taco, & Beer Battered Avocado Taco. 

We were charged a few drinks we did not order but it was taken care of easily. 

I received complementary caramel filled churros, whipped cream w/fruit, Hershey's chocolate dip, & horchata ice cream with a candle on a plate for birthday. It was delicious!

I could not thank our server and the restaurant enough. I had a great night, check this place out next time when you get the chance for unique tacos & a good selection of alcohol!"}
{"text":"We started our evening with the margaritas which were made with tajín salt foam, fresh squeezed lime and agave nector, and it just got better from there.

The guacamole was rich and chunky. The tacos were all great, but our favorite was the pork al pastor. The meat was marinated with achiote and chipotle and covered on avacado cream. The pineapple was a nice touch. 

Our server Daniel was fantastic. Great sense of humor and a lot of fun. 

This was a great surprise after arriving to the airport hours earlier. I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"If you want some amazing super authentic tacos, this is the place to go. Great atmosphere, very friendly staff, and awesome food makes for an enjoyable meal. The reasons for the 4 star rating are: the side of rice was extremely salty, and more so because my wife asked about her taco being spicy and was assured it wasn't and the salsa would be placed on the side. Although the salsa was on the side the chicken season was pretty spicy. Would think the server would have mentioned that."}
{"text":"Chips and Salsa is good, not great... I prefer my salsa spicy vs sweet.....
Corn salad was excellent! (Wish they served it hot instead of cold)
Neighboring table had the Queso Modelo which looked amazing! Will definitely try next time!

Baja Fish Tacos are delicious!!! A very good portion of perfectly fried fish and then some cold slaw and REAL guacamole, next time I will order a little extra of the chili-lime crema sauce...
Crispy Taco is a really good flavorful ground beef, but a little to heavy on the mashed potatoes for me.... still, and excellent taco.... I will definitely order again.
What is better?????  Order the Carne Asada with the crispy shell.... Yay!!

Went for lunch during the work week...... couldn't drink  :(  can't wait to go back and try the margarita!"}
{"text":"Well, I came to Tacos and beer for a salad and a water. It hit the spot. JK I ordered the Firestone IPA with a burrito and it was delicious, the bartender was attentive and knowledgeable. No five stars for corn in the rice, there should never be no corn in rice ever. And it was a little hot in the area. Splurge on some AC."}
{"text":"Experience:  I had a groupon that included chips and guacamole, 6 tacos and two sides, so I brought my girl to check it out. 
We actually hit it during happy hour too, so our beer was a very reasonable price too!

Service: we waited for a few minutes before anyone greeted us at the door.  The owner or manager finally came over and seated us. 
He did apologize for the wait too. 
Our waitress was ok...she was nice enough, just not very attentive. She was pretty busy, so it wasn't the best service. I'm reasonable about being busy, but when your waitress is the only one in the restaurant and she's too busy, that makes me think it's poor management. 

Food: the guacamole and chips were good. I ordered the fish taco, shrimp taco and the crunchy taco that has mashed potatoes in it, and the cilantro rice for my side. 
My fav was definitely the fish taco. The other two were good, but the fish taco was great!  
I ordered a Tecate, but they serve it in a can. I sent it back, because I'm not a fan of canned beer. I feel like the waitress should have warned me. 
So, then I ordered a grey lady beer, and it was actually very good.  It was a witbier or white beer. It's my first time trying it and I was impressed. Nice and light and even a little citrusy flavor....perfect because I did not want to fill up on beer. 

Facility: this is a cute little casual spot with some outdoor seating too. Would be great to sit outside in nice weather during happy hour for cheap beer and $2 tacos!

Overall review: I am going to give this a 4 star, because of the lacking service. However, I do see me returning to this spot for more tacos and beer!"}
{"text":"Killer Guacamole.

Must try: bacon wrapped Jalapeños. 
They are amazing and oh so hard to find. 

Strawberry mojitos are tasty but oh so strong. 

They also have outdoor seating which looks great for a cool summer night. There appears to be a bar with seating and plenty of options to choose from. 

Service was great and food arrived in a timely manner. The food server and food runner did a great job and were very attentive to detail."}
{"text":"First time here, came for my nieces bday, it is a crowded place and popular, really not bad. The staff does seem overwhelmed but do their best to keep up with all the customer needs.  We were a large party they did an amazing job keeping our drinks filled, taking our order and getting us our food.

There were times you had to flag someone down but with the level of business they do there, the food was very consistent coming out of the kitchen and no one was kept waiting.  The food here is actually pretty good as well as the selection of drinks they have available for you to choose from.

The prices are very reasonable and if you can make a reservation or call ahead, I would certainly suggest that as it seems this place stays packed.

This is a place I would go back to and I would recommend for some decent Mexican food with a Tapas/Small Plate selection as well.  This is not your average Mexican place, I would say it is a step above the rest and they try their best to impress."}
{"text":"Jerry was the best server ever!! Always kept our drinks filled and made us feel important. The tacos and Churros were also amazing! And they have happy hour margarita pitchers for 20$ that are 10/10!!'"}
{"text":"I just don't get tacos like this in Cleveland. I must say, these may be the very best I've ever had in my life. And I'm not one given to hyperbole. Excellent meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a little off of the strip and right near the Fairfield Inn Marriott. They have the absolute best tacos I've ever tasted in Las Vegas! The fish is very fresh and nothing is pre-made. The service can be a little slow, but the great attitude when the staff does come along makes the issue very minor. This will be my go to place when I'm traveling to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm going with a 3/5 mostly because I don't think the price is worth it. But there are a lot of things I like about this place!

The service was very friendly. Not super attentive, but definitely friendly. 

We spent $15 on three tacos and chips & salsa. I'm not a person who understands paying for chips & salsa. But I will say that their red salsa had a strong roasted flavor that was really enjoyable!

My husband got a shrimp taco he said was fine, but nothing special. And we both felt the same about the fries avocado taco. 

However, I absolutely loved the BBQ Beef taco. Their BBQ sauce was nice and sweet, just the way I like it. It also came with potatoes, but not enough o be over-powering. And I really enjoyed the crunchy shell. I haven't had one of those since childhood and I found it really satisfying. 

The patio is pretty great because it's not crowded (go figure) and they keep it cool with misters."}
{"text":"This is GOURMET Tacos and MICROBREW Beer - this is NOT your usual Tex Mex and Corona kind of place.  I saw on Yelp that it was a new business on Paradise Blvd and vowed to check it out after work.  It's in the old Firefly building.  Many great memories on that patio :). The decor is all redone Spanish mission style and much better lit now.  I ended up getting the shrimp tacos.  Small street tacos with intense flavor profiles and a small side of gormet salsa. I also got a Hitachino's Nest -- this is a Japanese microbrew and they have it ON DRAFT!  The beer list is written on the wall by the bar and contains all the best stuff- Unitis, Lost Coast, Stone, Brooklyn Brewing.  Staff was attentive and really sweet and funny.  I'm so happy to have found this.

Ok I just read that this place is owned by Mr Simmons - that owns Firefly.  They have had some pretty publicized scrapes with the Health Inspector in the past. Make your own decision.  Casinos do get away with a lot compared to small private places.  It looked VERY clean and well run when I was there."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find!!! We stumbled in here after looking for nearby food and couldn't resist the name.

They have a wide beer selection from breweries all over on draft with a supplemental bottled list that is sure to hit anyone's tastes or prefences.

They have a full bar so if beer isn't your thing,  no worries. 

That leads us to the tacos, there is such a variety of different amazing tacos that we found ourselves hard pressed not to order way too many. 

Rather then having plates the tacos are are alacart. The al pastor taco was my favorite, but nothing we tried was short of a 4 to 5 star taco.

If you havent tried this place you have to get in here!! The service was amazing, Emily was so sweet and attentive helping us navigate through the many tacos.

Will be bringing our friends here!!"}
{"text":"It was my boyfriends first time there a few months ago, and I was a little hesitant he wouldn't like it as much as I love it, but he did. We had some amazing food and one of the greatest servers that has ever waited on me. Frank was absolutely spectacular. Every one of his recommendations was spot on. He even helped my boyfriend sneak a shot in behind my back during a \"bathroom visit\"."}
{"text":"Love the Tacos very cheap and a great variety. 

Didn't like the fact that they charged $1.95 for Salsa and chips. The chips were good but you received less than a handful, just not a good portion for an appetizer.

I had the Dando, The crunchy taco, bean and cheese, and the chicken Asada.
The Charro beans were too salty, but the Mexican rice was on FLEEK! Lol"}
{"text":"I loved the bean and cheese taco, which had potatoes in the base, which was yummy. The only thing was that the tacos were room temperature, but still great."}
{"text":"Second time visiting this place. Best tacos I have ever had!!! I can't even find tacos like this at home. The service is also great. They are on top of the service and always asking if we need something else. I got two shrimp tacos and one chicken taco. The best flavor I could ask for and everything taste so fresh. Can't wait to come back and eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm giving this establishment 3 stars, not because I didn't like the food and drinks, but because of it's particular choices in decoration:

FOR THE FOOD: 3.5 STARS
The tacos were unique, but it doesn't beat the original Mexican taco places around Las Vegas. I don't like how some tacos use ground beef or pork (ex. the al pastor) tacos. Overall, the tacos tasted good, and I particularly liked the vegetarian tacos a lot. The refried beans were awesome! The drinks are TOO EXPENSIVE for what they provide. $8 for a margarita, I had assumed that it would at least come in a tall glass, but instead, it comes in a small 8 oz. glass.

FOR THE SERVICE: 5 STARS
The service was perfect. Our server was very attentive and checked up on us frequently. Only criticism, was that, every time we have gone there, there was always been one missing taco. Every time. Maybe it's just a miscommunication.

FOR THE DECORATION: 1 STAR
Some of the stuff is questionable. I like the unique pop culture components. However, the religious components mixed with the alcohol theme is tasteless. Even for non-religous customers, it can be offending and disrespectful, because it is blasphemy. I hope the artists of the restaurant reconsider their theme. I think it's particularly disrespects a religion when you have Mother Mary eating a taco and being surrounded with alcohol. Not to be one of those overly sensitive trolls that get \"offended\" with everything, but I like to courteous of other beliefs. If that done to others, I am sure it would be very disappointing to them as well."}
{"text":"Frank! Huge shout out to him for being an amazing attentive server. 
Never been in before and he was so patient and accommodating to us!
Tried a flight of 6 brews...which was pretty pricey to be honest but worth it because they have unique and rare beers on draft. (Plus large bottle selection as well!)
Tortilla soup was hands down best I have ever tried! So hearty and flavorful! 
Loved our tacos I only wish there was more room in my belly for more!
We will be back! 
Decor was so unique and hip!!! And to add...the rest of the staff was very attentive as well! 
My fave was shrimp tacos and if you go on Tuesday's the tacos are all 50 cents off!!!! Take a bottle of hot sauce to go trust me!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food. 1 star for the service in regards to allergies.

The tacos are delicious and creative! Between the 4 people in our group, we shared about 15 tacos. 

We mentioned to the server that our friend has a shellfish allergy. Pretty standard allergy. The server seemed flustered and said our friend would have to sign a waiver. This is ridiculous! If a restaurant does not know the protocol when it comes to allergies how are they still open? No restaurant should require you to sign a waiver because of an allergy. The server was not very professional and did not smile once. He seemed to hate being there, which didn't ruin our time, we just felt bad for him. We found out which tacos our friend couldn't have after the server went back and forth to the kitchen a few times. He didn't seem to know how the food was made, which is embarrassing for him and the management for not training their staff thoroughly. We found out that they fry the fish in the same oil they put everything else in, which is not only gross because the other stuff tastes fishy, but it could potentially hurt someone very badly if they weren't aware of this. 

Again the tacos are delicious, but if you have an allergy make the management aware."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite taco spots in Vegas as a local residents. 

First, the environment is very fun. It's a great social spots to bring friends, enjoy delicious foods and hang out. There may be a wait time, especially on busy nights and Tuesday's, i would say reservation is recommended. Also they have techno Tuesday, you have to go to find out. Their decoration is also sick, with candles floating on top and some funny Hispanic artwork.

Second, the service is great. The staff is very friendly and the waiters never left me thirsty. The food and drinks came out very quickly as well. 

As for the food, they have great sangria and margaritas, a wide variety of delicious tacos, my favorites being the Baja fish taco, al pastor, shrimp. Their carne asada fries is super good too. They also have a lot of beer choices, and a bar to hang out at. 

As I mentioned before, this is one of my favorite spots in Vegas, whether you are hanging with friends or on a date, you'll have fun and enjoy some good drinks and food."}
{"text":"Good beer selection and a nice spot to hang with the buds for Beer and... Tacos. You're going to pay double for tacos here vs the hole in a wall joints, but it's safe, clean, and nice here. The quacomole is very fresh here."}
{"text":"Went for sushi but the restaurant wasn't open yet so we popped next door to Tacos and Beer. I must admit I was not looking forward to overpriced, Americanized a la carte tacos. I was so wrong about this place. It was fabulous!! Tortillas are made fresh right in front of you. We split a corn salad to start. It was absolutely bursting with fresh flavor - a little kick but not spicy - just perfection. The pork tacos are amazing - melt in your mouth delicious with a flavorful tomatillo sauce and a sprinkle of pork rind for a punch of texture and flavor overload. And those tacos are only $2.50 each for happy hour! Oh, and by the way, these are not tiny tacos - they are big, full of fresh ingredients, and absolutely made to order. Amazing for the price - even after happy hour they're only $3.50. We also tried veggie - with yummy puréed potatoes, along with poblano - with fresh cojita, chicken and finally barbacoa. They were all great! I ordered my tacos in a lettuce wrap which allowed me to sample a few more flavors as I didn't get so full on tortillas and they were fabulous. We can't wait to come back to this place."}
{"text":"We stopped in after work and Nicole took care of us. She was prompt and incredibly friendly. She turned a bad day into a great evening."}
{"text":"Super impressed with the food here. Excellent product at a great value. The skinny margarita was well done. The tomatillo salsa was delicious but the chips were disappointing."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Wait staff very helpful and nice.  Beer selection was pretty good.  Being a warm day we elected to go with the Deschutes Fresh Squeezed w/ Grapefruit Juice (a.k.a shandy) per the waitress suggestion.  Hit the spot.  Tacos were really good as well.  All in all a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Took a party of 5 for lunch. You have to pay for chips & salsa?  The chips were stale and they were very stingy with the chips. Had to ask for a refill 3 times before they refilled them. Tacos were ok at best. The asada has little taste. The al pastor was weak. The fish taco was good. Will not return."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for her birthday dinner. We had an incredible experience. The service was great and the food was fantastic. We had the guacamole with pumpkin seeds and pomegranate on top for an appetizer. We both got tacos and then had churros for dessert. This and and a margarita each came out to be less than $50. 

Great food and service for a very reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Great place with very cool decor, very nice vibe. Delicious tacos and strong beer selection. Our server Frank was awesome!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place besides the cool catchy name. Tacos were good (Taco Y Taco on Eastern is much better). I didn't care for the chips. Small selection of beer. Only two choices of draft beer. It is more a tourist trap due to the prices and quality."}
{"text":"Went to taco Tuesday, their website said one thing they did another. We waited 30 minutes for a tiny little cramped table. The waiter was rude, no one was very accommodating, and then to top it off they don't do split checks. We walked out. So not worth it."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant for a celebration dinner with my coworkers. I set a reservation for a party of 15 at 8:30pm. At 7:50pm, I receive a call from the hostess letting me know that they will not be honoring my reservation. When I asked why, she said \"well someone should've let you know earlier. Someone was supposed to call you, but it's Taco Tuesday so we don't take reservations.\" She couldn't be bothered to even apologize for the inconvenience.
I informed her that obviously someone had taken my reservation and I had a large party. She said that if I got there by 8:15, they would put us on the wait list now and have us seated then. So I rushed down there, and when I arrived, the same hostess then told me that it would be another half hour wait. We waited for an hour. The hostess sends me the text letting us know that our table is ready, so all 15 of us head in. She then lets us know that the table isn't really ready yet, but she just wanted us to \"be ready so we wouldn't lose our t.\" So now there are 15 people clogging up their entry way and blocking the only exit for an additional 5 minutes. They finally seat us, and the tacos were amazing as always. Our server was great! I truly love the tacos here. 
I wish they had better management and hosting staff. Truly horrendous. No matter how much I love the serving staff and the food, my party of 15 will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm only giving 4 stars for the food, not the service. I had a raspberry margarita that was amazing. I also got 2 carne asada tacos and 1 lengua. The meat itself had very great flavor and the toppings tasted just as great as they looked. The overall presentation of the food was pleasing. 
I do have to say that the waiter hardly came to the table. Anytime something was needed, which was rare, we had to flag him down. Once the order was put it, drinks and food came out quickly."}
{"text":"This place is great and in the regular rotation when you want a great value, delicious tacos and a sweet beer selection. Cool build out in the former Firefly Restaurant location on Paradise. Nice casual place to watch a big game and good for groups. They've always got the Sculpin Grapefruit IPA on tap which as far as I'm concerned, is the best beer out there. Puerco verde tacos are my fav, same with grilled fish but I haven't had a bad one yet and I think I've tried them all!"}
{"text":"Update: Natalie the Bartender is awesome also! She's Very friendly and has such an outgoing personality. this is only my second time here, but I love this place! Drinks: hands down the best house margaritas I've ever had in Vegas, and I've been out here my whole life. My boyfriend had the michelada, he is from Mexico and said their micheladas are amazing! Also the bartender was Blake and he was awesome, had a great personality and was very attentive to all of the guests. They also have such an amazing wide selection of beers !! I can't wait to try them all. 
Food: the tacos on happy hour are so good, we got 3 chicken ones and 4 beef ones, I don't recall the names of the meat because they're fancy names and in Spanish, that my boyfriend had to explain to me, but we were just looking at the happy hour menu,but they were tasty and an awesome deal for $2.50 each. I also love how they have housemate hot sauces! They are all so tasty I can't even tell you which one I like the best.
Atmosphere: great people, great vibes, awesome staff, and good conversations. We will definitely be regulars here. Thank you for the great service. If I could give this place a 10 star I would. Thank you Blake for making our experience as great as you did, you're an awesome bartender, and you make the best margaritas I've had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"It was our first time at Tacos & Beer! We really enjoyed the food, service, & atmosphere! Our server Alberto was very informative & made great suggestions with the food, beers, & cocktails! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Simple concept and design, but they are doing it right. 

The beer battered fish tacos, but grilled version (by special request) are delicious!! The only issue I usually ever have at this restaurant is getting any sort of refills on the drinks in a timely manner. They charge for the chips and salsa and I had one server charge for refills on salsa, but none of the other servers have ever charged us before, so I am not sure what that was about. I tried the carnitas tacos and found them to be bland, personally. The burritos are quite large and according to my friends who have ordered them, they are very good. 

The green salsa that comes with the chips and salsa is fantastic. I wish I could buy a bottle of it for home! 

Tacos & beer is a great lunch spot and though I haven't been here for dinner yet, I feel like the atmosphere would be fun for dinner as well."}
{"text":"This was a great place to try a variety of tacos while having a beer.  Our server Ben was very friendly and attentive.  My fav taco was the shrimp one.  The churro dessert was amazzzzing, thnx Ben!"}
{"text":"I wish I remembered the name of the dip I got but it was amazing! And the guy at the bar was really nice. Will be back by"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a place named Tacos and Beer. They're the two things I love in life. Apparently it can get packed here, but the two times I have been here have been pretty chill. They have a great selection of beer. Lots of different IPAs which is a plus for this hop head. The tacos are good. Not amazing, but still good. Slightly bigger than a street taco, there is a lot of ones to choose from. I have tried the chicken tinga, carne asada, barbacoa, shrimp, pastor, and carnitas. With a good vibe, good food, great beer selection, and friendly staff, this place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Decided to go on a Tuesday we get there and it is techno taco Tuesday pretty cool I mean something different . We walk inside they have two speakers which made it very very loud inside you could barely hear your self talk . The hottest came up and with a horrible attitude asked how many in our party . We say two she takes us to a high top we ask for a table or a booth she says there is no both available boyfriend and I turn around and see the whole row empty . We sat there our server came up and we asked to sit outside because it was too loud inside he was nice and said sure . The hostess came up again with an attitude and took us to our table . We ordered the food did come out super fast which is why i am giving 3 stars it was pretty good the michelada was amazing . The service I would give 2 stars at most due to the attitude and when we tried to get the check we had to ask 4 different people . Finally after 25 min we got it ."}
{"text":"If i rated this place on food alone with taste 5 star. If you want service poor. Waited over hour for tacos and cane out cold! Really pisd after waiting that long. As far as table service slow and just absent. Really disappointed. 

However as i finally got done typing this. Manager came over apologized got us some comps really really tried to make our c experiemce better. 3 star to 4 star because of the efforts."}
{"text":"AMAZING & AUTHENTIC! The vibe in here is so great, and the handmade tortillas are unreal. Rachel is an awesome, down to earth and helpful server. Definitely coming back to Tacos & Beer next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Quickly becoming obsessed with this place! 

You cannot go wrong with any taco & even tho they offer several house-made salsas, there is so much flavor happening..the salsas aren't necessary. 

They have a great beer selection & awesome seasonal craft cocktails.. 

Super impressed with all the Vegan style tacos (even one with Jackfruit!), the veggie, the crunchy chicken, & the shrimp & baja fish!!

The vibe is awesome & the service is great. 
Plan on hitting this place weekly."}
{"text":"Tacos and beer is a go to place, every TACO TECHNO TUESDAY. Aside from the killer music, amazing food, and delicious beer, frank makes my experience memorable each time. Can't wait until next week!"}
{"text":"Delicious and tasty tacos!! I'm already debating what to get the next time I go back. Shrimp tacos were my absolute favorite! I got the pablano taco (8 out of 10) the Baja fish taco, (6 out of 10) and the shrimp taco which was a 10/10! Maybe even more. The chips and salsa were just ok, but the green salsa was the bomb!
We also got the  bacon wrapped jalapeños.... Yes, I'm coming back and bringing my appetite. See you there!"}
{"text":"This place has a huge selection of tacos and beer (big surprise given the name, huh?). It was actually pretty good over all, though this isn't the place to go if you just like good simple street tacos. This place definitely targets the hipster/trendy crowd, and the menu (and prices) reflect that.

The menu has at least twenty types of tacos, ranging from the basics to more fusion style. The have carne asada, the classic crunchy taco, carnitas, al pastor, etc... along with unusual things like bbq beef. By far their most original creations were their vegan tacos, which actually blew me away (at least the ones we tried).

Since this was our first time here my wife and I ordered way too many tacos to sample their menu. It was taco Tuesday, so all the tacos were 50 cents off. The tacos range in price from $2.70 to $3.70, which seemed a little pricy. However, when the tacos arrived I was surprise by how large they were, so they are worth the price. It was obvious upon their arrival that we had over ordered, as all the tacos also had good portions of meat in them instead of piles of lettuce and other toppings.

The tacos themselves were a mixed bag. We tried 14 (yes, I know that's way too much for two people) different tacos. I loved the carne asada, though my wife didn't. I also really liked the chicken Asada and their vegan tacos blew me away. In particular their jackfruit carnitas taco was amazing! I would have sworn it was meat! The flavor was awesome and if your vegan or vegetarian you have to check this place out. My wife and I both agreed that our favorite taco was the pork shoulder though, which will be a must have every time we return here in the future.

There were only a few tacos we didn't care for. The crunchy chicken and bbq beef were both disappointing. The bbq sauce was too sweat and the both these tacos had mashed potatoes at the bottom, which just didn't work. We also didn't care for the chili verde, which was two stringy and the green sauce was overpowering.

One other thing I should point out I didn't like, and its something simple. First of all, I have never liked Mexican restaurants that charge for chips and salsa, but if you do, they should at least be good. The chips tasted like they came out of any bag you bought at a grocery store and their salsas were blah. Right before our tacos came out they brought out three bottles of home made sauces, which were far better than the salsa. The sauces should have just come out with the chips to make them better. For a place that is supposed to be higher end they really should have been better.

I almost forgot, we got the Choco Tacos for desert. You get two desert tacos for $5, and they were so worth it! They were homemade with horchata ice cream (which tasted like homemade vanilla, which is a compliment). This was a highlight of our meal. I highly recommend them. A perfect desert for two people.

Their beer selection was a nice selection of craft, with most beers in the $6 to $8 range. If your into craft, and don't mind the slightly high price, this is a good place to check out.

So in summary, if you want to check out a higher end taco shop, this is a decent place. Don't get the chips and salsa and don't be afraid to try the amazing vegan tacos."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give half stars bc I always hesitate giving 5's unless I absolutely loved everything, even the service, to death. So 4.5 for this place! Service was a hair slow on the order taking, but we were seated promptly and ordered chips salsa and guac. Guac is good, could be a little more flavorful. Salsa was good...they just don't give too much. I love the water of all things but maybe was just thirsty. I got the happy hour margarita. The recipe was a tad on the sour side for my liking, but still a good marg. recently I went vegetarian so I had the veggie and bean and cheese taco. My husband had all the meat you could ask for. Tortillas are hand made and spot on! Ambiance of the restaurant is nice. Younger crowd with a nice bar and outdoor seating separate from the dining room. Great find off the beaten path! Will definitely stop in again when in vegas!!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. Beer selection is beyond awesome (and the primary reason for the good rating), and the food is just what it says it is. The tacos seemed to be a little overstuffed, which is a mixed blessing... you get what you pay for, but they were a challenge to eat."}
{"text":"I got to try this place via postmates thank goodness! Too bad I have no photos because I inhaled those tacos in 2 minutes.

Yes- definitely get the Baja tacos - for those who don't know what that traditionally is, it's beer battered white fish with some form of slaw and salsa. I'd say they executed it pretty darn well~ fish was perfectly crisp and soft inside and their avocado sauce accented the fish well. 

No-  don't do the carnitas - they were lacking flavor and crisp usually from being broiled. I was sadly disappointed by these soggy carnitas tacos and do not recommend."}
{"text":"When first arriving we were seated sooner than expected. Paid for chips and got plenty more in refills, because it took forever to get are food. Salsa was good (4/5). Yet charged extra for the salsa for the chips. Drinks were warm, little ice. Food was ok, tacos were nothing special. Flavors were over the top a bit excessive at times. Atmosphere was fun and vibrant. Out of everything Rudy, (are waiter) was excellent  despite the disappointing aspects.

Sincerely: The True Review"}
{"text":"Just want to say again.

This place is great!

So many tacos to choose from!

The sides menu has a couple hidden gems.

The beer selection is very good.

The tequila choices are good as well.

The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. 

It's a great regular joint when in vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! They have vegan and vegetarian options too. On Sunday's and Tuesday's they have an outside area that plays music until 2."}
{"text":"Do not go here unless you like waiting 20 minutes for a drink and I'm talking about alcohol the bartenders at this place are just slow and awful! As you can tell from the other yelp reviews that have been removed that this place just doesn't get customer service. This place is owned by the same owner of fire fly which Years ago was shut down at this location now where tacos is for unsanitary items. FYI to the owner you can remove all the bad yelp review but word of mouth is still out there and stringer that apps so no one I know will be going here again"}
{"text":"Many tacos have perished from this place at my hands. Was their death in vein? I don't really care just.... MORE TACOS PLEASE!!!!!!!

Oh yeah and the service is good. They serve the most delicious tacos."}
{"text":"Love this place. The decor is awesome. Perfect place for date night, night out with friends or family dinner. The chips and salsa are on point. Love this place cause it's not like every other taco or mexican place in town.  Favorites are the crunchy taco made with mashed potatoes (hubby loved all the meaty tacos), guacomole with pumpkin seeds and pomegranate seeds and  enchilada stack. Great beer selection. Ton of craft beers. Def will be checking this place out again soon."}
{"text":"The tacos were amazing. You have to try the barbecue beef-it has mashed potatoes in it. Yes-and it's that good.
I will be coming back to try the 20 different kinds of tacos!"}
{"text":"Food was freaky good omg. But the service was kinda bad. Smh I think next time we will sit at the bar then or Order Togo. I was really confused a lot of people took are order."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos. Lengua, carnitas, chorizo, carnw asada. All were top notch and the beer list was also good"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service!
Ask for Frank....good guy....excellent personality. 
My husband and I enjoyed our dining experience."}
{"text":"Let's Taco bout this place...AMAZING! Go here when you need a good time with great food!!!"}
{"text":"I had a great time here with my friends. The tacos were so good, we all ordered more. Loved the hot sauces.
The ambiance was warm and clean, and the service was decent, they were busy so somethings took a while, but all in all a happy experience."}
{"text":"Went last night for a political meet up and they had canceled the reservation so none of the tables were set up. I asked where the meet up was at the door and the two men standing there didn't know and then said the waiter would know. The waiter took me outside while they set the tables fast because it was 105 degrees. 
  He took my wine order then next thing I know people are getting their food so I asked the woman serving water if my wine was coming and she assured me it was but looked confused. After 30 mins I finally just went to the bar. The water was refilled every 5 mins but no one took my order and the whole situation happened all over again. It's just easier to go up to the bar. I didn't eat but the menu looked great and had loads of options. Very inexpensive and everyone at the table seemed to be taken care of. I would definitely give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Amazing service, food and good times! I literally told our server Luis surprise us with drinks and tacos and everything he brought us was amazing. We had mezcal cocktails that I wouldn't of usually ordered and were delicious! Even our busses Carla was friendly, knowledgeable and went out of her way to look after us. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Place was recommended to us by a staff member at the Hard Rock.... Thank you !!!
I am pretty sure the mahi mahi fish taco was the best I have ever had. I also got a shrimp taco- just as delicious. My husband said his 4 were off the hook. Great selection of Microbrew beers on tap- Homerun !! Friendly helpful staff and very good prices."}
{"text":"Came here for a work dinner on a Tuesday. I like the concept because beer and tacos, duh lol. I love that they have Victoria, my favorite beer. The al pastor tacos were strong.  The lingua not so much,  but not bad. Bacon wrapped jalapeño rocked. We all enjoyed our food.  Our server appeared pretty out of it,  waaaaay  mellow and relaxed, maaaaaan. Half baked tacos and beer."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Tacos & Beer!  Whenever anyone comes to town I bring them here for fresh tacos, chips & guacamole & let's not forget the Cadillac Margaritas with the salt foam!  Yummee!  Armundo was incredible the last time I was there & he helped make my company party & my girlfriend's birthday incredible!  Thank you all so much!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere t this place. The art in this establishment is awesome. The tacos are very flavorful but in my opinion they are over price. I did enjoy this place and will go back :)"}
{"text":"As tourists, we were looking for somewhere that wasn't a chain, wasn't a tourist trap, and wasn't overpriced. This place checked all three boxes. Fun, relaxed atmosphere with a hipster vibe. We sat outside on the patio. It seemed like most others outside with us had been there before. Upon being seated, we were given a binder with beer and cocktail options. There were about 2 dozen tacos on the menu. We ordered the carne asada, beer battered avocado, jackfruit, puerco verde, beef barbacoa, and the crunchy. All were perfectly delicious! The Crunchy was surprisingly the standout for us. Mainly, because it was like a gourmet Taco Bell Taco Supreme, for lack of better description. It was delicious! And it had mashed potatoes under the beef! This place is amazing! We're only here for a few days, but considering going back!"}
{"text":"this place is a hidden gem!! it's only 5 minutes away from the strip and i highly suggest you take your friends to visit for some delicious tacos! our server 'Alan' was extremely attentive, helpful and helped us with suggestions on what to eat. they also have house salsa and chile which are delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome tacos!!! Go on a Tuesday night for their techno taco Tuesday night! They have an awesome techno tent with lasers and a great world class dj along with dollar taco specials. I highly recommend. A local favorite"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! Prices are great and quality is even better- all of their food and tacos are like art which are complimented well with the service of their staff and artistic design of the restaurant. Definitely the place to go for some good food and drinks!"}
{"text":"I'd say this place was good. 

Our waiter was friendly and helped me pick out a chocolate stout which was really good. 

We got served our drinks and appetizers right away. But then it took a while for our tacos to be served. 

We got chips and salsa along with the jalapenos stuffed with cream cheese and wrapped in bacon. Both were good, I kind of wish we tried the guac too.

The tacos were just ok. I got three; the al pastor, carne asada and the crunchy. Out of all three the crunchy was by far the best and most unique. It had meat, mashed potatoes, sour cream, tomato and cheese. The other two were just ok, I would prefer taco y taco.

I recommend if you come here order the tacos that are out of the ordinary because they taste better than the normal taco staples."}
{"text":"Great taco joint.  Hard to find anything that even slightly resembles real Mexican food in Las Vegas. This place has it figured out though. The al pastor and carne Asada are delicious. The salsas they serve with chips are a little underwhelming, but I liked the avacado one the best.

Approximately 20 beers on tap from all around, makes it easy to find something to enjoy. 

I'll be heading back whenever I have a taco craving that needs a fix."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and haven't been disappointed yet. Have almost tried the whole menu. Everything its pretty tasty. The service is always amazing as well. Definitely would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place. Definitely make reservations if you're going for dinner on the weekend. We visited and were apart of a large group and they took pretty good care of us. There were a few mix ups with the orders but the staff was eager to right the wrongs. I ordered the Baja fish taco and two beer battered avocado tacos and i was in taco heaven. Seriously this place is a true gem. I also ordered an Avery brewery beer which I haven't seen outside of Colorado which was pretty amazing. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was tasty. Restaurant was clean.

There wasn't an \"Open\" sign lit so I didn't know they were open until I tried to open a door. Also I had no clue which door to go into as it wasn't properly labeled."}
{"text":"This is a very amercianized Mexican place, but the food is really, really good. I had a carne asada burrito and it was awesome. They also had a great selection of hot sauces."}
{"text":"Although the this place has amazing handmade tortilla tacos and beer the service today was mediocre at best one of the waitresses would only ask my boyfriend for refills on his drink and not me... I feel if you are going to serve a table make sure everyone is taken care of not just one person... My first time I came the service was awesome but it could have been because the owner was here so everyone was on their best behavior...I will come back again but I hope the staff can display the same awesome service I had my first time"}
{"text":"Amazing service Oscar and Manuel take great care of us. Highly recommend you check out this place! Great food and service I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There seems to be a lot of rave around this place.  Let me be completely honest with this place and say that it's very average.  Some of the tacos are really good, many of them are very average, and a few of them are not good at all. It's about $2-$4 per taco, and they are very small.  You will get one order of complimentary chips and salsa, and then you have to pay to have a refill.  I think I ended up paying about $12 for my lunch, and I was pretty hungry afterwards. The environment is very casual, with plenty of televisions to watch any sports games going on. I haven't had the alcohol, so I can't speak to any of that.  As far as the food goes, it's very average and you could get a much better taco at Los Tacos or Tacos El Gordo. I wouldn't avoid eating here, but this would definitely not be my destination of choice."}
{"text":"This place is obviously for tourists who don't know their way around Vegas. When we got there, they seated us I'm the dining room because it was Latin night. A place that serves tacos has a Latin night? It turns out there was a band who began laying in as we were leaving (which means we could have say in the dining room). The coctel was more like canned clams, canned crab, strangely halved shrimp in a ketchup sauce. The tacos were way overpriced, as was the beer. For the price of the carne asada, I expected some flavor and no gristle, but the most flavor I got from one was when I bit into the hidden lime. If you want some authentic Mexican food, get farther away from the strip and go somewhere that has actual recipes."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of Mexican spots before & Tacos and beer stood out to me because not only do you enjoy some amazing beers cocktails and tacos but the atmosphere this place has is incredible the service was amazing the manager came out touched the table I recommend this for anyone looking for great food and good drinks will back !"}
{"text":"UPDATE: My boyfriend and I have been coming here EVERY Sunday night for as long as we can remember. We've also come on other nights when we crave their veggie tacos, including on \"Techno Taco Tuesdays.\" Tonight is \"Techno Taco Tuesday,\" and I guess they have started a new cover fee program, charging $5 per person to enter the restaurant. Huh? I just want my veggie tacos. I'm not a fan of techno music at all. I am not here to party. We just want to eat. I've never before heard of a place putting an extra charge to enter the restaurant on top of buying food and drinks. Even the top nightclubs in town don't charge cover if you get a table! The cover charge amount is not the issue...yes, we did pay the extra $10 so we could get our food and drinks. My issue is the principle! They are taking advantage of people that just want to eat at the restaurant. They should just charge the people trying to party, not the people that are just trying to eat. 

Old review: My boyfriend & I came in on Nacho House Sundays last Sunday night around 1am. We have recently been cutting down our meat consumption so we gave the veggie tacos a try this time. We each got a beef taco and 2 veggie tacos. OH MY GOD! The veggie tacos were by far the best ever! We both preferred them to our usual favorites. You know a restaurant is good when their veggie dishes are just as good as their meat dishes! The food is always solid here, and the drinks are usually on point as well. 
I have complained in the past about the volume of the music, but this time it was low enough that we could hear each other while we were eating (at the furthest table from the DJ booth). After eating, we walked outside to the DJ playing some great old school soul music. I am not a fan of their Techno Taco Tuesdays, but man do I LOVE their Nacho House Sundays! We ended up staying an extra half hour dancing with everyone else I the dance floor. So much fun!!! We are definitely looking forward to spending every future Sunday night here!!!!"}
{"text":"Dame una cerveza!

 Dined at this supercool lounge like restaurant last night for some T&B. The lights were dim and the vibe is hip.

I'm trying to live my best Pescatarian friendly lifestyle so I opted for:

Jackfruit Carnitas VEGAN Tacos $3.70 Unsure if it's a vegetable or fruit grown from trees in South India but it's a delicious meat substitute garnished with pickled red onions and cilantro.

Rajas Con Crema $2.70 Taste way better than it looks. Seasoned well and the cheese was delightful.

Beer Battered Avocado VEGAN $3.70 I didn't bother to ask if they use separate frying oil but I'm hopeful advertising Vegan they do! Delicious meat alternative.

There was a mix up with the (7) tacos ordered and what was served. Be sure to check your Tacos for accuracy! The overall service is just okay

I'd return!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a Tuesday night, which happened to be taco Tuesday. 50 cents off tacos. We started with chips and salsa. There's two salsas, a red and a green one. Both were good. The portion was kinda small though. Most Mexican restaurants, chips and salsa/bean dip are complimentary so I felt it could be bigger. Next we had the tortilla soup. It was good, but wasn't the best. It lacked garnishes like cilantro or lime that would have taken it to the next level. I ordered three tacos: the lengua, al pastor, and the grilled fish. I loved all three of them! Whatever they topped each taco with was perfect. The flavors were amazing! My boyfriend ordered the baja taco and that's like battered fish. That was too big and greasy, the only thing we didn't like there."}
{"text":"Food was greatly satisfying, got the beef barbacoa, puerco verde, baja taco, carne asada, all are amazingly good. All tacos stuffed till literally spilling out of the taco tortilla as you take a bite... service was excellent. I will be back to try other tacos"}
{"text":"Great spot on Paradise near the strip. Authentic and flavorful options. Lots to choose from. 

We started with bacon wrapped jalapeños in what I can only describe as Sauce of the Gods! It was SO good my mind got a cramp thinking about it. Guajillo chili sauce was beyond words. You just have to taste it yourself. 

Had the pork al pastor tacos and they were awesome. From the menu - \"marinated w/achiote & chipotle, w/avocado cream, pineapple, onion, cilantro.\" Very good!

Then finished with a churro that defied logic! Cream filled and served with multiple sauces. Good night!!!

Access a little tricky because you have to turn in before you see it. If you see it you're already past it. No big deal. Hook a u-turn and swing back!"}
{"text":"Tacos & Beer is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. The tacos are the most delicious hipster tacos with excellent vegetarian options. Beer and tequila menu it also terrific. Servers are great, Franco is especially good to us. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Not only was the food fuego, but the jalapeño Margherita was everything I could've hoped for. Our server Justin was on the beat with his recommendations, almost as hot as the beats he dropped."}
{"text":"I don't see what all the hype on this place is. I tried three tacos and none were outstanding.  I had the carne asada,  the pastor,  and a fried fish taco.  Out of the three the fish was the best but it still wasn't great. Baja fresh has better fish tacos! I also ordered a chips and salsa very basic. The green salsa was pretty good.  I had a cold beer 4$ at happy hour.  All being said I was not very impressed and won't be back I think they're over hyped. There's better taco spots out there."}
{"text":"Worth the .9 mile walk off the strip. All the reviews I read were spot on. Refreshing margaritas, top notch ceviche, some of the best guacamole I've ever had, and queso with beer in it. Barbacoa and pork al pastor? Yes please"}
{"text":"3 stars. 
Waiter took others' orders and got them waters before us (we sat first)
Food was average. 
Nothing too great to make me wanna come back"}
{"text":"Come for the tacos and beer, stay for the Tacos & Beer. This is my 3rd time here and they never let me down. T&B offers a comprehensive variety of tacos and a beer list to match. Stray away from the strip and experience the place the locals go for food. Prices are super reasonable, especially for Vegas. Lots of vegetarian and vegan options too!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with my friend, before a concert. She made a reservation for 6:15 online through Yelp. She said it popped up when she was reading reviews, which is very convenient! There were still a few open tables, however, when we got there. 

The decor is cute. It's in the old Firefly location on Paradise, but only half of it. I believe the other half is a sushi place. 

We both ordered a veggie empanada and some beer to start. Unfortunately I do not remember the name of mine. It's on the fruity list, and came in a light blue almost Hawaiian can. Only complaint I have is that my friend had taken a drink of the beer that had been left in the can, and the server walked by and poured it in to my glass of beer without asking. I'm a weirdo about spit, so I was very turned off by this. The can wasn't even sitting by me. I know he didn't know better, but still. 

The veggie empanadas were very good! I ate all of it, including the side ingredients on the plate!

I also ordered the jackfruit carnitas taco, and the beer battered avocado taco - both vegan. The jackfruit carnitas was pretty good, could use a little more \"umph\". Still overall pretty tasty. The beer battered avocado taco was my favorite by far. The avocado was crisp and not mushy like I half expected. Very tasty. 

There are a few things I would like to go back and try for sure. Service was good, not too crowded, and pricing was good!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Vegas! Not even close. Their fish taco is sooo yummy, great white sauce, nice fresh cabbage and the flavor on the fish is wonderful. Great crunch on the breading. I ended up ordering six tacos (they're a la carte) but reasonably priced. My wife had five. I tried the lengua, first time and it was pretty good. The spicy beef and the both pork tacos I had were really nice too. The service was a bit slow and inattentive, not bad but just meh. Also, the check in process and wait list was very disorganized. We didn't wait long but there wasn't much in the way of systems in place for it to be executed well. 

All in all, A+ food with B- service. The food alone will bring us back"}
{"text":"Had an awesome experience at this quiet spot East of the Strip. 

Had guacamole with bacon...yum!

Great Rojo y verde Salsas!

I shared 9 different tacos and all were amazing. Meat juicy and flavorful. Tortillas were fresh and light. 

Best part of all was the Evil Twin Triple IPA. Epic!"}
{"text":"I don't trust any Mexican restaurant that charges for chips and salsa, but that's the thing, this isn't a Mexican taco place, it's a hipster taco place. And while the food was tasty, I'd rather go to a \"lesser\" restaurant and get twice the food for the same price."}
{"text":"OMG!  I LOVE THIS PLACE!   Great atmosphere, great food, great beer, and inexpensive!

Nice beer selection, both on tap and bottled.   Eclectic decor.  Dim, romantic lighting -- The hanging ceiling? light made from Mexican prayer-jar-candles is brilliant.

Some of our fave tacos were the Puerco Verde, BBQ (wasn't too sweet), and Cochinita Pibil.  Haven't tried the Carnitas yet, but next time. The corn salad with cotija cheese is awesome. Get it.  Super nice yet professional staff.  A selection of bottled house hot sauces appears if you request.

Great date night choice, or just to hang and eat great food, drink good beer, and not go broke in the process.  

A unique Vegas gem.  Very highly recommend."}
{"text":"I came here after a Hennessy event at Chateau nightclub with friends. Looking at the reviews for happy hour and hearing our friends say how good it is made me excited to try it out. Also during their happy hour it wasn't too bad when I went at 12 am. Here's my thing, the wait was fine and we got seated right away. Once we ordered our drinks and tacos they took WAYYY too long and made no sense because our waiter decided that he'll do the other table who came in after us order wise and they got their orders quicker than we did?!! Hmmm I was mad and so was our friends, check this out?!! How are you going to bring us to a table and not have napkins or utensils on a table?!! Like that type of stuff should be prepared and ready to go for customers? Will not comeback and waste my time for a restaurant who doesn't try and put effort for its customers."}
{"text":"Driving down Paradise on the way to the convention center and my wife was hungry so we stopped in.

Really good food.  Good chips, good salsa.  Her taco was fresh and delicious.  

The waitress was really accommodating to all our requests.  

If your thinking about eating here give it a try."}
{"text":"Great and unique beer selection. Staff seemed to be on it. Very friendly and she gave good recommendations. I've been here about 5 times and everything I have had is great. I love that they are open late night. Occasionally they have a DJ and their happy hour is insanely cheap. $3 Mexican beers and $2 tacos. Shut the front door! 

What else do you want people!?!"}
{"text":"We come here every few weeks we love it so much. The people are so kind and friendly they give great service. I love the queso modelo, the crunchy taco and definitely get the corn salad!!! The atmosphere is cool and laid back, ALWAYS great music. and Frank is the best server ever!!"}
{"text":"The quality of this establishment has gone down over the last few months. The food is still good, but the quality isn't consistent. Service has become poor. I used to be a fan of T&B and lately it's been a real let down."}
{"text":"Came in with a deal from groupon - chips and guac, 6 tacos, and 2 sides all for $20. It was definitely worth it. The tacos were amazing, especially the al pastor and baja fish. Some of the best guacamole I've ever had. The atmosphere is really neat, a place worth checking out."}
{"text":"If you love tacos, this is your place.  If you like beer you will like this place even more.  I stopped in here twice during my trip to vegas for the week.  They have some amazing taco combinations and you buy them individually, so you are not stuck with a plate of food you only wanted half of. 

They also had a great beer selection, most I had not heard of.  They are happy to offer suggestions and give you samples until you find something you like.  All of the staff here was great and the bill was small even with all the food and beer."}
{"text":"Second night in a row of going to this place. Awesome tacos! Second night we had way better service. Hanna was on top of it and quick with the food and drinks. Always had a smile."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my sisters, its one of their favorite places in town for tacos. I honestly wasn't very impressed. The variety of tacos they have is fantastic, but the over all taste for they ones I ordered was nothing amazing. It also might be that I'm not a huge taco person to begin with so that probably isn't helping.

I ordered the Carne  Asada, Shrimp, Chicken Tinga, and Pineapple taco. Pineapple being the best without a doubt.

The service/staff was excellent and so was the restaurant itself. They have a great selection of beer and a good sized menu of tacos. This is also an excellent place for vegetarians as they have a number of veg tacos. 

Tacos range from $3-4 each. I say that so you know this isn't your cheap 0.50 cent taco place. The price might be a little high but for the quality of ingredients and customization its expected."}
{"text":"Oh man, there's lots to say about #TacosandBeer and #Beer, first of all its in my top 5 best Mexican restaurants in las vegas, everyone knows there's times you just can't settle for Robertos; I highly recommend trying there Carne asada tacos & ask for their hot sauces, if your not sweating your not taking in the whole culture, did I mention this resturant has the besy underground scene in las vegas, yeah #TECHNOTACOTUESDAY is the day to drop on by and get your dose of tacos and deep vibes with resident djs like BadBeat & Lance LeRock(Founders, MNTRA (Record Labele) brings only the finest to the is city and that's why you should visit Tacos and beer!"}
{"text":"The decor and ambiance is amazing. I love the Catarina statues and the old school feel to the place. The tacos are so good! My favorite are the Baja fish tacos and rajas! Would definitely be a great place to come with friends or on a date. The churro dessert was also delicious. The churros reminded me of the ones in Mexico!"}
{"text":"Luis exceeded my expectations and the food was great. Very cozy restaurant, definitely a place you want to check out!"}
{"text":"Food is great but not so much customer service which is why I didn't give them 5 stars I was waiting forever for my waitress to come by and I understand if it's busy but they were just leaning around not doing anything in front of guests."}
{"text":"Walked up on a late night in Vegas with a craving for Tacos. Figured you can't go wrong with a name like Tacos and Beer. Name says it all...
Average sized off strip restaurant with an open air patio cooled with misters to tone down the 100 deg Vegas nights. Inside is a walk up bar and table seating. Good music mix creates a lively atmosphere. 

Beer - Good mix of craft and mainstream Brews both on tap and bottle. And no taco place is complete without a list of margaritas. 

Tacos - Wow! Great selection of individually ordered tacos for 3-4$. And the flavour was amazing. Tried the grilled fish and carnitas and both were stuffed with fresh toppings. 

Only knock was the service was a bit slow. Waited 15min to place drink order but looked like the waiter was swamped. He seemed like he was working hard but maybe a bit light of staff that night. Glad we had patience though as the food made up for it.

Do yourself a favour and get off strip and get some Tacos and Beer....

FYI... Apparently the Techno Taco Tuesday is packed and loud. Great to people watch but expect to wait and get ready for noise"}
{"text":"Good tacos & beer!!!  Stopped in with 3 buddies and sat at the bar.  Our bartender/server was great. I had 3 tacos, Al Pastor (ok, a little rubbery though) Chorizo (AMAZING!) and Beef Barbacoa (meh)...  Side of cilantro lime rice for $2 that comes in a cup a little bigger than a shot glass... Oh, the queso fondido was really good...

Good selection of craft beers and your regular dumpy Mexican beers."}
{"text":"This place has been amazing both times I've gone. Once with three people and once with over ten. The service and food were both great for a great price. The bacon wrapped jalapeños were awesome, I got them both times. I also had the fundido, again amazing. As for tacos, I had carne asada both times, shrimp, crunchy chicken, and another chicken one with pickled slaw. Delicious. They also have a full bar... not just beer. :)"}
{"text":"I'm so impressed!!! The food was amazing, the service was amazing, the vibe was amazing, the drinks were amazing!!! 
I highly recommend!!! The tostada salad is wonderful. 

Just thought I'd share!!!"}
{"text":"We just watched a movie and figured we'd stop by for tacos, as it was Tuesday. We reserved a table at 10pm and proceeded to the bar when the hostess said it'd be 20-minutes.

An hour later, still no table and I was tired of standing, plus it was getting stuffy. I went to check the patio, however I was stopped. The gentleman said talk to the girl to my left. Puzzled, I looked over, she waved hi. Apparently she was signaling me to pay $5, which I thought was profound. At this point I'm hangry and frustrated by the whole thing, so I pay for my party. As she charges me, I'm told they don't have seating outside; real class act. At this point, I'm ready to leave, when another guy reaches towards me asking for my ID. WTF!?

I walk back to the hostess and ask the table situation. Surprised, she says \"you haven't been seated yet?\" I already had more friends in their way, so I was stuck. We waited another 30-minutes before being seated and another 20-minutes before a server came by. All in all, I waited 2-hours for two choco-tacos and I went home. At least they tasted good."}
{"text":"You gotta be kidding me. This place is awesome!  There are so many choices and everything tastes fresh!  The service was excellent. We had a large group and were left wanting for Nada!  Just a great culinary and service act!  They're busy every nite so keep that in mind!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food.  Love this place.  Great service as well.  We will Definitely be back when we're  in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place seems great to eat at in but we ordered it to go and it was awful. We got two orders of Carne Asade fries and there wasn't a SINGLE piece of meat on either order of fries. When we called to inform them, they said we had to take it up with the delivery app instead of them. Completely unacceptable. Will never order from them again."}
{"text":"Overall, the food was pretty good. I tried the chicken tostadas - the proportions were perfect; just the right amount and they had a good flavor. My boyfriend had the baja fish tacos which he said were good. He tries fish tacos from just about every place we go and hasnt been pleased with every place, but seemed satisfied with these ones."}
{"text":"My waitress, Rachel, was so nice and helpful, but the bartender wouldn't let me try a beer on tap because it was $11 ... mind you she did give me of a cheaper beer, but was less than 1 oz ... Haha okay for sure."}
{"text":"Hello welcome to Tacos and Beer. I went here for an event . Elote tasting event. This event was advertised on Facebook and had 550 people saying they were going. My expectation for this \"event\" was not what I experienced. If you are going to have an event and advertise it, you must be prepared for it. I was thinking maybe parking lot blocked off with a beer tent and Elote being cooked on a grill nearby. The Elote were these barely bite size tastings, and there was hardly enough for all that came to participate. I had one flavor of the four offered. When I arrived the staff had no idea about event or where we should sit. We sat in restaurant and I guess we should have been sat in bar. Bar was way overcrowded standing only. We did get some food and drinks where we were and the staff did their best to keep checking on us. I ordered a beer and did not get what I ordered and it came in a plastic cup half the size of the glasses my friends got. For the price of the Beer I ordered I asked for a proper container and correct beer. the server had me keep the one he gave me and I never saw him again. No charge for beer though, so that was fine. Overall this was my best view of the restaurant and was not happy with it. 

Thank You for dining? Tacos and Beer. I may go back and give them a second chance. Menu looked good and I saw some plates that looked appetizing. I can say will not attend any more poorly planned events there."}
{"text":"Amazing! Made a reservation on open table, sat down right away. Good beer selection. Try the jackfruit tacos!"}
{"text":"Came for taco Tuesday!!!
This place is fun and great for small groups only. It is kind of pack and loud inside so I don't think it's great for large parties. Their Taco selection is awesome they have a good variety of tacos and they are pretty filling too. The tacos were flavorful and delicious. My favorites are their crunchy tacos!! 
I wouldn't necessarily come here if I am looking for like authentic street style tacos though since the tacos here are topped with lots of different ingredients like cheese, guac, sour cream, and salsa.

Taco Tuesday is 50% off tacos"}
{"text":"Always a decently fun and entertaining time for Techno Taco Tuesday's, but I've still no reason to come here otherwise. Each week, I attend TTT with a group of 7 other friends. Working in retail/customer service myself, I understand the importance of putting the customer first and leaving emotions at the door upon starting a shift. The fact the bartenders here always seem to project negative energy and place blame on customers for any dissatisfaction in food/drink orders is horrifying, concerning and an upset to say the very least. Tonight was the third strike for me & all I'd asked for was a \"Negra Modelo\" for myself and a Corona for a friend. When I was handed a (classic?) Negra I verbalized that I wanted a Negra Modela, and was told by the bartender that I \"should have specified what I wanted then.\" & I was completely flabbergasted and appalled. A word of advice: train your staff in customer service practices. I guarantee you'll see an increase in profit because they've cost and prevented your business from making a profit from *at least* 7 people to continue spending money tonight. Keep in mind that there are currently only 41 people outside. That's roughly a 17% loss. Congrats!"}
{"text":"Very savory tacos. To fat or gristle. Perfect Margaritas.  Bartender was helpful with the menu and  specials."}
{"text":"Had excellent service last night provided by a lovely young lady named Emily Portillo. She was very attentive and helpful with suggestion from the menu. Thanks Emily and hope to see you again in the near future"}
{"text":"Good food.  Like many places that get popular, the service starts getting bad.  The receptionists has total attitude.  Asked about seating and got a sarcastic rude response.  Bus boy practically knocked over my soda glass and bot a peep.  Tacos are pretty good as tortillas are hand made."}
{"text":"As I sit in the parking lot in front of tacos and beer, I am floored by the level of professionalism and courtesy when I had a small complaint about an order I placed for to go food. I am so pleasantly surprised with the prompt responses from leadership, the pleasant service, and the delicious food. I am particularly picky, and ordered food without salsa, and the mistake was so small I almost didn't realize that there was salsa on the tacos. I called that night and the manager I spoke with was awesome and she offered to replace the food. Unfortunately I am a terrible customer and didn't come the night that I told her I would. Tonight, I called and spoke to Carlos, the manager at this location for tonight. He was polite and respectful and got my order prepared for me before I even arrived. He came out and greeted me himself, apologize for the mistake, and made me feel very welcome if I were to come back. He also upgraded all of my tacos to carne Asada instead of just giving me the chicken, for free. He also took the extra step to separate the cheese so it wouldn't get soggy on my way home. I am so happy and feel like I could eat here every night for the rest of my life and get this high level of service every time. This place is a total five star and definitely a place you should check out if you're a tourist or a local like myself. Also they have really cool shirts and I can't wait to buy one. Thanks tacos and beer, thanks Carlos, and thank you yelp for letting me share this awesome experience. I will be back over and over and over. Totally worth the drive from my house, and I will be sure to tote along my coworkers with me whenever I come in. -Rachel"}
{"text":"I love this place! My coworkers and I come all the time. It is always busy, but you never have to wait too long for a table as they turn over quickly.
They serve small Mexican street-style tacos that are sure to please everyone. They also offer three vegan taco options, plus a few vegetarian ones you can ask to leave the dairy off of.
Their customer service is amazing and they won't hesitate to fix any issues you may have.
The beer list is great too.
I would love to see them add some vegan dessert options."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food.

Good happy hour.

Good drinks.

Nice staff.

They have fallen into the ridiculous Vegas mentality that pumping bass helps a restaurant- Sunday's and Tuesday's.

They just started this trend.  It's a terrible choice in my opinion.  People were constantly asking for it to be turned down.

It is saddening that management has decided to fall victim to the whole Vegas idea of loud repetitive music rather than catering to locals like they used to.

It would be 5 star but the music is a serious deterrent.

Sad."}
{"text":"After a horrible experience at El Dorado Cantina, we decided to try Imperial Tacos and Beer -- wow, so delicious. 

The restaurant has a great feel to it and from the moment we walked in, the customer service was on point. Our server was attentive and did a great job making suggestions. There are other items on the menu, but the extensive taco list is the only place you need to order from. 

At $2.99-$3.50 taco, you can't go wrong and the opportunity is there to mix and match. My first round consisted of: 1 carne asada; 1 al pastor and 1 carnitas. All three were tasty but the al pastor and carnitas really hit the spot. In fact, after those three, I ordered another al pastor and carnitas. The tacos are loaded with meat and the toppings compliment them well. All the tacos are served on homemade corn tortillas and I believe that makes all the difference.

If you're in the area and looking for a clean, sit down establishment serving ice cold beer and tasty tacos at a reasonable price...head down to Imperial."}
{"text":"Cute and cozy restaurant in what used to be The original Firefly. Inside is lushly decorated and not your traditional obnoxious Mexican style. I went there on a Thursday and it was not very busy. We were eager to sit outside as the weather was just perfect, not a breathtaking view but sometimes it's just nice to sit outside. The server took a while to get to us and server seemed a little bit rushed. We ordered guacamole as an appetizer. It was pretty good, not sure if the chips were made in house or bought. I ordered the margarita and the server kindly let me know they use \"foam salt\" I had never tried it prior to coming here and I was feeling a little bit adventurous so I decided to opt into it. It was more foam than salt flavor but it didn't really change the margarita, next time I would order just the plain salt grain. 
I had one carne asada taco and one lengua (beef tongue taco). The tortilla was definitely one of the best I've had in town, other than that, the carne asada was too salty and it did not come with limes. The lengua was pretty good. 

Overall I wasn't particularly a fan of the service but the food was decent. They do have an extensive beer menu and taco selection which I was impressed with."}
{"text":"Tried again and everything went well, staff is still working on things, but I understand, thank you tacos & beer for caring about your customers."}
{"text":"Tacos and Beer is a cool little spot off the strip for a easy, and fun night out.  During my visit, the atmosphere was good and the service was great. They serve a number of tacos for you to pick from, so come hungry.  The tacos topped with spicy salsa at happy hour were good.  The fish was cooked nicely.  It was not dry and it still contained it's moisture when we ate.  The prices are reasonable. Again a fun place to hangout for lunch, dinner or a late night snack."}
{"text":"Love the ambience. This place is good for birthdays. I got the shrimp tacos and battered fish tacos which were both bombbbb. Can't wait to come back here again."}
{"text":"Tacos were excellent. Although, my tacos came about ten minutes before my friend's. The server was awkward and never checked on us. While my friend was waiting for his food, the server kept asking if we wanted more chips, not our actual order. I'll try this place out again in hopes of better service."}
{"text":"After my initial review, I was contacted immediately by the manager. He wanted further details on my experience and was sincerely sorry for all the trouble I had with my orders. He asked that I forward him the orders I made online (which I assumed was for actual proof I ordered from them), which I of course did. This afternoon, The manager, Manuel, on his DAY OFF MIND YOU, delivered everything we had ever ordered from them. If that's not going above and beyond, I don't know what is. 

As stated in the previous Review, there food is DELICIOUS and reasonably priced!

Manuel, thank you!"}
{"text":"The Vibe In This Place Is Amazing! The Candle Chandelier vibe was my favorite thing that really made me enjoy being in there! lol Plus My Taco's where soooo good! (beer battered baja style tacos) I wish I had some right now!! ^__^"}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this. Like 20 different kinds of tacos all a la carte, between $2.50 and $3.95. 2 of them and you're pretty full, 3 of them and you're stuffed. Staff is always super friendly and they come around to refill your water often,  ambiance has a buzz (especially on Techno Taco Tuesday, where they have a live DJ spinning all night) place is open late night which is huge, and the lighting is awesome with all of the votive candles re-purposed as lights. Bacon wrapped cream cheese stuffed Jalapenos are a must and are to die for. Flan is very rich and perfect sized. Alberto served me the other night and he was very attentive and fast with taking care of everything. This place needs to multiply soon."}
{"text":"Tacos are good it's super small in there. Came with 5 other friends and after 2h they told us to hurry up because they had another reservation coming up. I was shocked that has never happen in any other restaurant. We were all drinking and eating so very surprising to experience that."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos. Had 3 varieties, alpastor, pibil and Baja  fish. All three were excellent. Service was perfect as well. Price was very reasonable as well. Highly recommended! !!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Vegas. The food is good. Prices are reasonable. It has atmosphere.
Most of all the staff are always friendly. You have a wide choice of tacos. The Creme is the best in my opinion. Make it a stop if you re looks NV for real food."}
{"text":"OMG this place is incredible and EXACTLY where/what/how I want to eat. The service was great as our server was friendly, knowledgeable and fun. He did bug out to who knows where as we were waiting to pay our bill, but by that point I was already picking out which stickers to buy. 
Beers: They got em! Itemized by style, with all the deets, and if you know me, I found an IPA that I've yet to swallow, and remedied that soon after ordering. 
We had the bacon-wrapped jalapenos. KILLER!!!
The tacos were each a different instantiation of awesomeness. We ordered 5 and bit a bit at each. I've had a better deep-fried avo taco (in TX), but that's just dumb to mention cuz damn! We tried the puerco verde with the chicharones, which was incredible, and along with the shrimp taco, our only representatives of anything resembling traditional Mexican fare. There was some out of control veggie taco with cactus and black beans and mushrooms and, you know, mashed potatoes...
yup.
The mashed potatoes are also featured on their \"crunchy\" taco, which is just a regular crunchy taco, but with mashed potatoes, cuz ya know, mashed potatoes...
Neato tidbit: the ceiling lighting fixtures are re-purposed old Mexican Santo candles like you can buy at corner groceries. We sat right under St. Anthony. 
Dope."}
{"text":"FRANK. You were a great server! Attentive, accommodating and very sweet. My boyfriend and I enjoyed his service and the food was a perfect match for the amazing people. Delicious and did not disappoint. The price can be deceiving but on taco Tuesday this is the location to be"}
{"text":"One of the better joints I've been to in a long time. Scratch made everything and that's always a plus in any restaurant. Flavors were absolutely off the hook. They had Firestone Succaba---beer lovers would appreciate this! I had a chorizo, pastor, and verde taco---amazing, period!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Fun atmosphere, great service, good drinks and food. Relatively busy but they take reservations. Recommended by a friend so I'm glad we tried it. Will be back for sure....that beer battered avocado taco was bomb!"}
{"text":"I've always came here during the late night on \"Taco Tuesday\" crowd gets packed outside at night. 

I'm in love with their food! Shrimp taco's is my favorite for sure. I'm not a vegetarian but i heard that the veggie taco was good and it definitely is! 

In the mood for taco's? Check this place out. You won't be disappointed, I'll definitely become a regular customer here :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Vegan Tacos & Beer selection! The staff is very fast, friendly, and accommodating, especially with large groups and kids. My favorite taco was the Fried Avocado Taco which paired nicely with the Tanaya Creek beer on tap! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Service suck big times, I had 12 of my coworkers that we're hungry and thirsty, they never came to check on us for drinks, we got up to get our own drinks at bar and tacos were cold when they finally came to our tables, we know what tacos  are about we from Los Angeles. I hate writing bad reviews, the manager came over to our table and realized that there was a problem, we told him we asking for any freebies just wanted good service, he took care of us with a shot of tequila and churros and everyone  was happy."}
{"text":"Very cool restaurant. I cannot seem to find a authentic mexican restaurant in Vegas. This one did not hit the spot. Customer service is good, waiters were attentive got seated right away, we had reservations. The Restaurant was really dark though... like uncomfortably dark. The food was not my taste. I like that down home mexican food, this food was bland to me. The rice was too salty and tasted like pure lime. The beans were bland. The enchiladas were not at all good. Food was served warm I like my food hot. They didn't serve pepsi, had to get sprite. Good spot but not for me."}
{"text":"Stopped by mid-afternoon today wanting nachos and margaritas. They weren't that busy at all and the hostess gave us attitude about wanting a table versus sitting at the bar. (Hard to share food between three people at the bar.) We ended up walking out because she was so rude and condescending. I'm giving two stars because we've been here before and the food is good. But the service can be so-so and apparently some staff need to work on their customer service skills."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great chill atmosphere. Service is spectacular and quick. Beer selection is plentiful. Tacos are phenomenal. My favorite is the Carne Asada, Puerco Verde, Crunchy, and Baja Fish. You can't go wrong with those 4.  The salsa is super fresh and they multiple to choose from. Price is reasonable for the quality food you get here."}
{"text":"Seriously, delicious food!
But service needs to be improved. Had a cold taco on the plate (it came out cold), so ordered a bowl of rice and beans to replace it bc lost appetite for the taco...25 min wait without getting checked and the group had finished their food. Had to flag down the server and asked for them not to put the rice and beans on the bill and to not bring them out bc we had waited too long and we were ready to leave. Instead of an apology, I received an eye roll. And they weren't even busy!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Where do I even begin? 

Aesthetic: 5 Star. Cool music, it's like a cool spin on Mexican 

Service: 5 Star. They know their menu and make awesome recommendations for food and drink. 

Food: 5 Star, highly recommend the \"flutas\" to start, we had like a sampler of half their tacos and all were amazing. The meat is soooo tender. The sauces they use wow. Wow wow. Fresh amazing. I have high expectation for a dining experience and they met everything. 

HIGHLY recommend if u want chill atmosphere good tacos and drinks."}
{"text":"Every taco I ate was amazing! The  pastor, puerco verde, Barbados y lengua. Place is ridiculous with flavor. I got here at 3:00. The bartenders we're solid. I will keep this in my notes for the next Vegas trip. Prices were good for the value. And lastly, I'm stuffed. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Sometimes you are in the mood for good tacos and a refreshing drink, and when that is the case, you should go to Tacos and Beer! Although the vibe was a bit off when I visited, the service and the food was great. The waiters promptly greeted us, took our order and made some awesome recommendations for us.

Although went for the happy our specials (tacos and margaritas), the available variety was awesome and, for just $2 a taco, you cannot go wrong with any of them. Even the tacos that are not included in the happy hour pricing, are still very affordable and of good value. We had the tinga, shrimp, pastor, carne asada, chicken and pork tacos and they were ALL delicious! I am not sure about the rest of their dishes, but if they are as good as the tacos, you should be safe ordering anything off the menu.

Before ending this review, I want to give them props for their passion fruit margarita. It is perfectly TART with balanced sweetness, so it is incredibly refreshing. I hope you like it as well. 

Central location, good service, awesome tacos, incredible drinks. Definitely a place I will come back to."}
{"text":"I got the wrong beer three times in two visits, but I'm still giving the place 5 stars. That's how much I liked it. Everything: the food, the beer (when I got the right one, and even sometimes when I didn't), the ambience, and the waitstaff.

I was in town for a trade show and in search of good tacos and beer. What luck to find Tacos + Beer just a mile away!

Let's start with the food. I'm from Florida and lived in New Mexico for four years, so I've had my share of good Mexican food. This is very, very good Mexican food. You can get individual tacos ($2.50-$4 ea.), enchiladas, tortas, nachos, etc. There are about 12-16 taco varieties to choose from, and over my two visits I tried pretty much all of them. My favorites were the Baja (fried) fish and the Rajas con Crema (roasted chiles + oaxaca cheese), but they were all phenomenal. The tortillas are fresh-made on site (you can watch it being done) and the ingredients all tasted very, very fresh. If you're a cilantro hater like myself, they'll happily remove it when possible. I also had a bit of someone else's torta and it was very tasty if slightly soggy due to the filling they chose.)

Then there's the beer. Las Vegas is a s**t town for beer. Everyone knows this. But this place has a beer selection to rival some of my favorite places in Boston, which is really saying something. There are 20 taps and they offer a really surprising mix of local, faraway domestic, and international beers. In my first visit, for instance, I had a Tilquin Gueuze, a Tahoe Mountain wild ale, and a Ballast Point Victory at Sea. These would be great addition to taps anywhere, let alone Vegas. Lots of German and Belgian drafts, and even some from Switzerland(!). Reasonably priced, too.

The service was also excellent. We arrived on time for our first reservation but our table wasn't ready. The manager greeted us, explained the situation and gave us a free round of drafts (it was a group of 8, so 8 free beers). He also stopped by the table later on to give us some samples of newly tapped beers. The waitstaff were also extremely friendly, efficient, and accommodating. They happily handled split checks, despite our large party size.

The downsides? Either the bartender or the waiter mucked up our beer orders a couple times (perhaps a lack of familiarity with the subject matter, since they weren't like-for-like mixups), but they made it right quickly and without fuss.

Did I mention the place is really affordable? Fully belly and a nice buzz for $27 + tip. Can't complain."}
{"text":"Tacos & Beer is always a good spot for tacos and drinks with friends. They always have music going with a pretty big crowd inside and outside that seems to be consistent during late hours. One of my favorite things to start with is the chips and guacamole or the QUESO FUNDIDO which is my favorite appetizer by far. Some of my favorite tacos are the Carne Asada, Crunchy, Fish, Chorizo and Barbacoa. The enchiladas, burritos, and nachos are all very good. The margaritas are good with quite a few to choose from. As always one of my favorite things about this place is that they are open late! So if you haven't had a chance to try Tacos & Beer do yourself a favor and get in there. 
Adios"}
{"text":"i would just like to thank this place for existing. excellent selection of rare bottled beers, the tacos are killer, and the atmosphere is great. will definitely be back whenever we're in vegas."}
{"text":"My friend & I were in Vegas & were in the mood for Mexican food.  We found this place. We ordered tacos & they were delicious! These aren't your ordinary tacos, this place adds a little flare. I had the carnitas taco, the meat was flavorful & it was topped with chicarone pieces. The crunchy ground beef taco had smashed potatoes in it. It was delicious & affordable. My only complaint is I wish they would have provided complimentary chips & salsa like most restaurants do. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool! Came here tonight to meet some friends for Taco Tuesday around 11pm. Apparently my friends had invited a bunch more friends too because we ended up having a big table for probably 12-15 people. Now I have to say that when approaching this place I wasn't really feeling the vibe, it's pretty much a bunch of people hanging out in a parking lot on the outside, but inside was much more inviting and more my scene. Our table was right when you walk in, the air conditioner was blasting so I was freezing initially, but luckily I brought a jacket or else that may have made me miserable. The music was loud like other reviewers have mentioned, it could definitely have been a bit lower so we could talk to each other without yelling, but the music they were playing was good, I liked it. Chips and salsa were good, my margarita was pretty standard, my boyfriend's Jalapeno Margarita was delicious! I got 2 of the Chicken Tinga tacos and they were awesome!! I really loved them, the best part was the texture of the tortilla, it was perfect. I could have easily eaten another taco or 2 but we had to take off, and I was comfortably full with all the chips and salsa. Service was decent, and our bill for the 2 of us where we had 2 happy hour margaritas and 6 tacos total was $33- a good deal! I'll definitely check this place out again for Taco Tuesday, but only if I can sit inside :)"}
{"text":"Muy buenos tacos, buena musica. Tenia tienpo sin comer unos buenos tacos en las vegas y menos barbacoa, demasiado rico. La carne del huarache de las mejores que e probado"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and each time it gets better! The service has always been great and the food is unique and delicious! I've had each of the vegan tacos and honestly can't choose a favorite. Their chips and salsa is an easy addition. You can ask for more chips for free but extra salsa will cost a dollar. The jalapeño margarita is great- it includes a light chili powder on the rim instead of salt which fresh jalapeños mixed in."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place!  I wasn't expecting the quality of food that I found there and I'm already planning on going back. The wait staff was great and my group didn't have to wait for anything!  Our waiter, Frank was the neatest person and had the coolest personality.  I recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The food here deserves 5 stars but I'm giving it 3 because of the staff.
I've been coming here for quite some time now and everyone that comes to Vegas to visit me, I bring them here and highly recommend this place to all my friends. But recently when I come in the staff is so incredibly rude it's starting to make me hate it here. 
Last time I came I brought 7 people with me and was basically told by the door girl that my party was too big and they could \"see if they could seat us\" and that the wait would be over an hour. I gladly gave them my number and told them we would be at Sushi Way (next door) having a drink while waiting. After about an hour and a half we went to check and they claimed they called me (but they didn't) and made us wait even longer then put to tables together and stuffed us in. Then when the table next to us opened up we asked if we could add the empty table so we weren't elbow to elbow and they were so incredibly rude about it, it made all of us uncomfortable after asking that. 

My friend (who I highly recommended this place to) came in on his lunch break and sat at the bar. He told me he actually timed it and sat for 21 minutes before the bar tender even acknowledged him. By this time his break was almost over so he got up and left. And said there were only 4 other people sitting at the bar. 

I use to come here and be personally greeted by the manager, matter of fact I have about 3 of his business cards. That's how great the service use to be here. Now they're rude and completely disrespectful.

Hopefully you guys get it together and hire more friendly staff. I'll give it a few gos before I stop bringing people here."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite!   Traditional Margarita was good and the tacos are the way to go.   Think of this as a taco bar with a huge selection of beer.   Great place to go hill after a long day of work or a long night of partays!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, delicious, fresh and fast, service was amazing, super friendly and attentive , I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a family friendly place and Real Mexican flavor, Muy Rico!"}
{"text":"Cost effective, excellent food at any time of day. It's only gets better with happy hour. If you want to skip the strip, this is a short car ride away from the mayhem."}
{"text":"Imperial Tacos and Beer is an awesome place if you want great food and ambience. The food is really good and the service was great. Our server was Armando and he was great!"}
{"text":"I hosted a corporate event and Fernanda took great care to make evening special. She was flexible, and responded promptly to all my requests. I recommend working with Tacos & Beers. Our group grew in size by the week, and then by the hour. And Tacos & Beers accommodated our party with good food and good beer. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I'm a passionate foodie native to San Diego, California and happen to have a significant other who is Mexican and Columbian. So trust me when I say we KNOW good tacos. But this place didn't have \"good tacos.\" I mean, they didn't even have \"great tacos.\" In fact, when we first heard of Tacos and Beer our expectations for an authentic Mexican dish were sub par, and we definitely weren't prepared for what was about to happen in that restaurant off the strip. We walked in and were immediately greeted by the restaurant manager, and offered a margarita. Ok, Brownie point #1. We were promptly seated amongst fellow hungry patrons and handed a menu to gaze over the vast options of appetizers, tacos, and beer. I quickly discussed the options with my date and we decided the only way to be sufficiently satisfied was try every single taco. So we did. The waiters didn't miss a beat! To our amazement taco after taco began to emerge from the kitchen and onto our table. We both grabbed one and immediately made mouth to taco contact.  What happened in those next few moments may only be understood by other Tacos and Beer diners. My taste buds were sensually awoken with powerful flavors of tenderly marinated carne asada layered between the savory caresses of cheese. My salivating mouth discovered many new tastes and textures with every second that passed.  I gazed up at my co-taco entrepreneur and realized he too was going through the same experience.  Our ravenous eyes locked and tacitly acknowledged that our trip for a simple bite rapidly became a life altering experience.  We exchanged tacos, allowing the other to orally grasp the new combination. More explosive tastes erupted from each bite, putting every other hand made taco I've ever had at home, or in Mexico to shame.  After sufficiently divulging each morsel (in some cases twice), we concluded that 1) to say that the were merely \"great tacos\" would be committing a great disservice...2) We were compelled to try dessert.  My sweet tooth landed on the churros, and his on the chocolate taco. Like with tacos in SD, I thought I was a veteran churro eater. I mean they sell a bag of 30sec old churro in the border crossing line...but as with the tacos, my palette was put to shame.  As I finished devouring the last of my devine, sugary stick of perfection, I became remorseful that our time at Tacos and Beer was coming to an end. All in all, the service was absolutely amazing,  and the food..well. The food was nothing short of mind boggling, mouth-gasming goodness that we will definitely be coming back for next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is little crazy but amazing tacos and there flan about the best I ever had they have music but is super fun for friends and date nite live this place staff was super cute and very friendly. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had in my life. The tortillas are so soft and the meat is super tender. I had the Lengua and Carne Asada tacos which were superioir. They are affordable and they have an awesome specials. Will definitely be hanging out here more."}
{"text":"Great food.  The tacos and selection were amazing.  For street tacos, they were a little bigger then the norm, which was good.  Service was good and the beer selection was outstanding.  Make sure to get the bacon wrapped jalapeños (not spicy) and the guacamole."}
{"text":"Vegan tacos  were hella good. I especially loved the vegan empanadas. The margarita was definitely strong and i'm not complaining ! i did spit up a jameson shot.... gross as f. the waiters were super nice too, very friendly. they also sang my attention seeking a** happy birthday."}
{"text":"Such good food! 3 vegetarian tacos & tons of other options. Literally I e eaten here twice & will continue to come back. Skully is a pretty good server!"}
{"text":"Best margaritas, best chips and salsa! It's so chill and tastes so amazing. I would definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"Great place overall.  Being from Texas I can be picky on tacos.  Quality of the tacos are top notch and at 3 - 4 bucks a piece reasonable, especially for being so near the strip. Being a brewer I can be picky on beer.  The beer list is quite frankly one of the better ones I have seen in public. The service for the most part is great.  The waiter was nice and did his job excellently.  Taco Tuesday is cool because all the Taco's are 50 cents off.  I highly recommend the Lengua and the Shrimp tacos. 

The only knocks on the place that gives it 4 not 5 stars are three things. #1) When seating us the hostess warned us we only had 1 to 1.5 hours to eat or they would ask us to leave so the can clear the table.  Highly odd and somewhat unsettling especially when the restaurant is 1/2 full at 6 pm on a Tuesday night.  Starts the night off with a bad tone, has you constantly checking your watch, and for an a la carte place like this it isn't unusual to order again after eating the first round.  #2) was the Queso.  We got the one with meat, etc in it.  It was OK not great.  Too much milk in it and the most bland thing we ate that night.  #3) Charging for chips and salsa is lame.  Just lame.  No excuse.  Lame.  

Overall definitely a great place to check out."}
{"text":"The Jalapeño margarita was great once they strained it. The tacos aren't that great. Cool little place tho, I spent $50 on 3 margaritas and 4 tacos... fail..."}
{"text":"Excellent and unusual beer selection.  Mostly not beers I've seen elsewhere.  The tacos are superlative and reasonably priced.  Ambiance is good.  They have outside seating with misters. Service was good,  too.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Like the atmosphere. Food is delicious. Once got the shrimp enchiladas with green sauce. Girlfriend got the pork enchiladas with the mole sauce. That was different and a little chocolatey. Service was great as well. The price is a little up there for Mexican food but it's the atmosphere that hikes up the price from say Tacos el Gordo."}
{"text":"Visited this spot for the first time last night for Techno Taco Tuesday! Delicious food & drinks and great Happy Hour prices! Will be returning again. Great social hipster eat spot!"}
{"text":"Tried some new things on my latest visit that should definitely be on your radar:
1. Guacamole - of course
2. Queso - probably made with some beer in it and it had beans which was a yummy surprise
3. Tortilla soup - this thing blew me away. It was full of delicious-ness
4. Churros - I'm still dreaming about these things.
5. Flan - I am not a fan of flan, but I could see why all 15 people at our table were going nuts over this stuff. It is better than the rest."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for this Tacos and Beer in La Vegas and would never have found this place at 3900 Paradise.


The guacamole was really fresh and great!

Recommend you check it out when you are in sin city."}
{"text":"Allen was the best...!!!!!!


Best food kn town and best fish tacos in LV

Dont be fooled by all the fancy restaurants. Complete your cravins here at Tacos and beer!! Great bear beer on tap as well"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer and tacos.  I was surprised to get 2 different Hefeweizen beers on tap- plus Weihenstephaner in bottles too.  Al Pastor taco was great.  Salsa must be made daily.  Yesterday it was a bit more smoky.  Love the atmosphere and art- especially above the bar and the eagle-mirror.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"So for months my cousin, Tracy Lee, had been posting pictures of her food from this restaurant so when I was finally in town and had the opportunity to finally grab some lunch with Tracy, she mentioned this place and I was like YES! I love me some tacos. 

First of all, the decor and feel of the restaurant is what I'd like to call \"modern taco chic.\" Cool vibes and fun colors. If Paisley happens to be the host, give him a high five because he is so wonderful and friendly. 

Their menu and beer selection is one of a kind. I'm loving this whole trend of gourmet tacos and this place does it so right. Tracy took charge of ordering the appetizers because she knows what's up. She went with the chips and guacamole with extra pomegranate seeds...possibly my new favorite thing to put in my mouth. Next she ordered the corn salad with a side of rice, which once you get them, mix them together! The corn salad is their take on Mexican street corn which we all know to be fabulous. Next I ordered two tacos, the Al Pastor and the Baja Fish. It was SO difficult to just chose two, they all looked mouth-watering. The Baja Fish was very yummy and big! However, I wish I would have followed Tracy's suit by ordering two Al Pastor tacos because OH. MY. GOSH. Easily the BEST Al Pastor taco I've ever had the pleasure of eating. 

They have an extensive list of craft beers on draught which will pair wonderfully with any of the food on their menu. We finished off our meal with their churro dessert and I can say I've never had churros quite like theirs, filled with deliciousness and chocolate sauce for dipping. 

If you're in Vegas, please check this place out!! I really wish they had a location in Arizona for me to go to!"}
{"text":"Tacos were very good. Not amazing but very good. Service was also very good. Churos we're good but would have been amazing if they were made from scratch. Tacos could of had a better shell too. The chicken taco was a little funky tasting. If they fix these small details this place would be packed."}
{"text":"TheBomb.com!!! Tasty food, great service! There was nothing bad on the menu and the beer selection was phenomenal! If ever in Vegas a must stop!"}
{"text":"This was somewhere we stopped by after dinner, with some friends, to have a couple of drinks.  They were so damn delicious with a spicy flare!!! Loved it! Had to test a taco and that was just as delish!!!! Heading back there soon to enjoy the full experience!  You should too!"}
{"text":"This place place is delicious!! In order from best to good is Bacon wrapped Jalapeños (bomb) tacos Cochinita Pibil (bomb) Baja Tacos (good) and Chicken enchiladas in green sauce (very good). I will definitely come back when in town. I didn't think it would be this good...tbh. I underestimated."}
{"text":"This place does what it's named after real well. There's a large selection of tacos. The server Frank helped us pick and explain how each taco was different. The pork al pastor and lingua were my favorites #TacosAndBeerOP #localspot"}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I have ever had!!! Great service like Las Vegas always have not like Santa Cruz where I'm from where the service is terrible 99% everywhere!!! Super good food great drinks and friendly staff!!! Viva Tacos and Beer!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty tacos, nice craft beer and the amazing Natalie at the bar.  Breakfast is served!"}
{"text":"Came to tacos and beer for the first time and I give it 3 stars because of customer service and the ambiance. The food was ok but it didn't meet my expectations."}
{"text":"An unexpected latenight drunken find.  Walked in, ordered food at the bar to go and got it quick.   I ordered a few tacos and they were mighty tasty!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. Very hip setting. The food was good although they didn't give me much salsa or offer any with the tacos, maybe I should've asked , they also forgot my last order before we closed our tab but overall it was a very good experience I would definitely recommend this place for some tacos and beer"}
{"text":"Great tacos, amazingly fresh guacamole, and an excellent atmosphere. I have been here in Vegas for six months and I cannot say I have had a better taco."}
{"text":"Love this place. Went here a couple times during SEMA. The menu is easy...Tacos and Beer, there are other dishes to order but this is probably what you should order. There are a ton of ala carte tacos to choose from. Favorite was the carne asada tacos. 

Good alternative to other places to eat around Vegas and you won't break the bank either. Good stuff"}
{"text":"Athena is wonderful. Great place, nice food, drinks are solid....but Athena is a wonderful person. Hopefully you get her if you come here!"}
{"text":"Love the variety of tacos! From the meat to the fish and veggie tacos, all tasted really fresh & had just the right amount of toppings. Honestly can say I've found my Holy Grail Churros!!!! Cajeta filled Churros, with a side of chocolate sauce, need I say more? Nice selection of beers on tap. Asked for a cold glass & Alberto didn't hesitate to pour my beer perfectly! Great service & awesome food!!"}
{"text":"Was starving and with my girls so we decided to come here! First time here and we ordered the chips and salsa (of course) which was very delicious btw! I ordered the pork al pastor tacos and carne asada tacos! Also with a margarita on the rocks! Their happy hour is a amazing and their staff is awesome! Kiana is a waitress and kept checking on us! So sweet! Will be back! Prices are affordable, they play great music and the food is to die for!"}
{"text":"The happy hour menu is good- limited selection of tacos $2.50, beers $4 and margaritas $5. I would be given 4 stars but we had to ask for menus, and ask to order so we could get our order started and ask for refills. The food was good and the service was quick once the order was in. ;)"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Good quality food and amazing drinks!! 
Carlos the manager there goes above and beyond for his customers! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I come here quite often since I work down the street. Their tacos are amazing and the prices are really good. I usually will start off with am order of chips and salsa and guac. My go to tacos are the fish tacos and crunchy tacos. The crunchy tacos have FREAKING MASHED POTATOES in them! It might sound weird, but it's genius and so delicious. They have taco Tuesdays here where you get 50 cents off each taco. The prices are relatively cheap. About $3 to $4 per taco. I'm usually stuffed with 2 tacos. They also have the option to replace the tortilla with a lettuce cup, which is a good alternative if you're looking for something a little healthier. The dessert here is not that great so I'd recommend skipping on that and get a Margarita instead."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place. The decor is beautiful and the food is very good. My problem is with the service. The servers just don't seem enthusiastic about their job and aren't personable. Its always busy in there so I understand the wait but once you do get ahold of your server just seems like when you're placing your order you're inconveniencing them. It took 30 minutes just to get drinks for our table and we felt rushed to make a decision on food because we didn't know when our server would be back. Like I said the food and atmosphere is great just wish the staff was better. If you have a few hours to spare and you don't really care about quality of service i'd definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I like tacos and beer, frank our waiter was absolutely amazing. I didn't like the small 6oz $10 Cadillac margarita, that was ridiculous. My food was a reasonable price and the service was great! I would suggest going but not ordering drinks."}
{"text":"I haven't had much from the menu, but the beer selection is on point. 

The staff is great and very knowledgeable about the rotating taps.

It's a small place and gets pretty crowded on weekends. They are also open pretty late (until 2 I believe), so it's a great spot for grub after a show at Hard Rock or if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Tacos and beer has amazing great quality food as well as a super friendly staff to go along with it :). Super clean and well managed.  Our server Alyssa is awesome with an amazing attitude and the manager here happily comped our meal . 10/10 would recommend coming back to this place"}
{"text":"Fantastic food at a great price. Go tapas style in the tacos and order a bunch. They're all amazing."}
{"text":"The best tacos in Las Vegas! I love how tasty every taco is so different from the next. The margaritas are the perfect mix of alcohol and sweet."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yum yum.  I won't lie to you - I came here four days out of seven on a trip to Vegas.  Twice with my husband to be before our wedding - once on my bachelorette night and then the day after our wedding with my family.  Everyone agreed - great spot. I tried the carne, chicken, and beer battered avocado tacos. Now I'm plain so I only get the meat and cheese and In the avocado case just beer battered avocado and cheese.  I kept going back to the beer battered avocado though. By my last visit this was the only taco I ordered x3. So good.  When we got back from our honeymoon I wanted to come here one more time before going home and we ALMOST made the 30 minute drive but we were too jet lagged.  That's how yummy it is though.  They are served in cute little perfect taco holders!!  Oh yea the nachos - hubby raving about them it's almost like they were baked the chips were golden crispy and be sure to add chicken!  Also my sister loves her taco salad and best friend had the jalapeño margarita and it was spicy enough for her spicy self. 

Oh And the churros!!! Serves with warm chocolate sauce oh melt in your mouth!!! 

They have happy hour I think every day but Taco Tuesday (that's another deal in itself).  Anyways very happy with this place and convenient location to the strip with an easy parking lot!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and atmosphere on a crowded busy night. 

Entering this place was like walking into a late night lounge. On this Friday 9pm visit, the place was packed (inside and out) with every seat filled, under the dimly lit, hanging electric candle lights. The place is very clean and tidy, decorative and stylish, all fitting for a return visit. 

While getting service wasn't an issue, it seemed the kind crew was understaffed on this busy night. I saw maybe two waitresses in a room that probably packs 60+. I think even the bussers helped refill waters and chips. 

BEER: I went for something new and different with the Gose Gone Wild Tijuana ($9 in an 12oz. sniffer glass). A bit sweet then immediately sour. Not my thing so I fell back to a safe beer, Corona, to compliment the tacos. 

3 TACOS: BBQ Beef ($3.70), Lengua ($3.70), Grilled Fish ($4.15). Damn, they were all bomb with BBQ Beef being favorite - it just had an awesome marinade to it. I only had three on this evening - there's probably a dozen more to try. 

Great food. Will come again to try new beers and tacos. On a busy night, it's a good spot to get in and get out. But I think the experience could be better on a slower night."}
{"text":"I came into tacos and beer and Joaquin's skills in cocktails made my experience a fun one, he talked drinks to me , and I asked him to surprise me with something I may like, what he brought back to me was exactly what he said he would make me, thank you for being an awesome mixologist"}
{"text":"Once again another 5 STAR review! Well, how could I not give 5 Stars? Its that damn delicious. Im telling you, you must stop in for their amazing delectable tacos!

And, I didnt know it was Happy Hour when I arrived, so a few of the tacos were $2.50.

Of course I had my favorite, Baja fish taco and also the Puerco verde(pork) taco.
My friend 'Chopper' had the BBQ beef and 2 Chicken Tingas.
LOVE LOVE LOVE them all..

We sat outside on the patio at my favorite table and enjoyed the 75 degree weather Las Vegas is having. 

Such a great way to enjoy the afternoon.

Thank you to the wait staff and 'Carla' who greeted us as we came in, she remembered me and that makes me feel good.

Sincerely appreciate the excellent food and exceptional service.

Its time to go get some tacos! Happy Hour is from 3-6"}
{"text":"The tacos and burritos were phenominal! favorites were the Al Pastor, BBQ beef, and cochinita pibil. the green salsa was great on the al pastor. my wife thought the taco salad was a bit disappointing.

this place is right off the strip in a center with a bunch of other great restaraunts."}
{"text":"This was the first time I have been and took family visiting to this place. Prices were good individual tacos were about 3.50 each and considered street taco size. They were amply filled. One corn tortilla for each taco which kind if annoyed me because anyone knows you should always use two to support the filling so it doesn't all fall apart which is what it did. Not sure if this is normal or they decided to cheap their guests because the majority are tourists. Couldn't tell how the drinks were but they did have an extensive cocktail, beer and wine list. An ok spot if your looking for cheap eats but I've had better at fast food taco shops around the city."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's been consistent for me every time.  It's not groundbreaking and they don't have the best tacos in the world but the flavors are solid and I never have an issue.  

On this particular occasion, my friend ordered a large margarita but received the smaller one.  The waiter seemed concerned but was able to convince us this was the better choice as the value for alcohol content is better.  He even came back with a half margarita to make up for the mistake, which I think was really appropriate.

The tacos are all unique and heavily flavored.  I'm kind of a purest and like my tacos to be more simple but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Tacos & Beer is trying to do here.  

Being so close to my job, my coworkers often come here for celebrations, good byes and just to hang out.  It's a pretty solid choice for any occasion."}
{"text":"Just plain awesome. Great beer selection. Tons of different tacos. Fun, relaxed atmosphere. Friendly and attentive service. Food was outstanding. Do yourself a favor and get off the Strip for Tacos and Beer!"}
{"text":"Unique tacos that were delicious. Chips and salsa were okay. 

Service was quick and polite."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and it is consistently good food with consistently ok service, especially if you're sitting on the patio. 

You obviously can't go wrong with ordering the tacos and beer... Duh! But if you must venture away from those items, I have to say, the salads are extremely flavorful and delicious!!! I have tried to copy creating it, but I just can't get it right. 

The decor is quite fun and interesting. There's large TV screens, a turtle with a skull head, burning candles, biblical people doing funny things, etc. This is a great place to start your night out with a group of people."}
{"text":"I can't give this place anything other than one star, unfortunately. The food was ok, the beer menu was more hipster than authentic Mexican, but the service is what earned the one star. 

There's ZERO decent parking in the lot, it's very small and crowded by 7pm. We waited 30 min for a table in what seemed like a pretty dead night for early taco Tuesday. We went to the bar to grab a beer while we waited, the bartender in her grungy beanie ignored us for several passes, and when she finally got to us, she seemed annoyed and was very rude. 

We actually discussed leaving and trying something else further down the block because of this, but no one in our group felt like re-parking so we stayed. 

When we were finally seated for dinner, we ordered chips and guacamole, another round of beer and we all ordered a set of 3 tacos. I was really hoping for truly authentic when it came to the food, and it was pretty much white-washed. They were still good, just not what I was hoping for. Decent portions for tacos (I had the Rajas, Carnitas and carne asada). Didn't care for the techno dance club tent they also set up in the parking lot either. 

This place came recommended from good friends at work, but I can't say we will be back or pass on such a good review. Pluses were definitely the"}
{"text":"Ate here the other night and this place is amazing. Great staff and the food is great. Love the beers that they have on tap and in bottle."}
{"text":"YUMMMM!!!

I cannot wait to return to this wonderful Boutique Mexican Taco Restaurant!!!! The atmosphere was very relaxing & not too loud. The staff was super helpful and pointed us in the right direction while ordering. You can't go wrong here, everything on the menu was delicious! *the guacamole needed a little more seasoning, but was still super fresh* Our drinks never ran dry & there was always someone checking on us. We had such a blast here & plan to return SOON!  :)"}
{"text":"We went there with a big group on Saturday night and it was awesome! The service was great despite the debacle that always comes with a huge group. We got a bunch of chips & salsa, guacamole, queso and flautas for the table and those disappeared. The guacamole is top notch with lots of avocado and the queso is probably the best I've had. I'm not sure what all is in it but it has a great flavor.

The beer selection is one of the best I've seen in town. They've got about 20 beers on tap and a lot more bottles. The beers on tap aren't your average beers either...they are hard-to-find microbrews and Belgians. The people at Tacos & Beer seem to know a thing or two about beer so they pick out the good stuff.

As for the tacos, I only got 2 since I was full from all the appetizers and beer but they were both touchdowns. I got the carne asada (a classic - and it was delicious) and the fish tacos. The fish taco was probably my favorite actually: big chunks of fish, tasty and crunchy veggies and a big dollop of guac on top.

Definitely recommend if you're visiting or a local."}
{"text":"This are the most delicious tacos I've tasted in my life. They have delicious menchiladas too. I am definitely returning."}
{"text":"I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars.  I've only been once, so I'm think 4 is probably more appropriate for a single visit.
First, we were there on a Friday night at 10:30pm and sat right down.  Service for us was GREAT ... from the bus boys to the servers.  And I'm the kind of guy that WILL tip less (or not at all) for bad service.
Second, I felt the price of the tacos was right in line for what you get.  These are definitely not your regular street tacos (which I like too).  For two us .... 4 tacos, one beer, and tip came to $21 (no complaints).
Third, the tacos were really good.  Only got to try two, so looking forward to going back and trying some of the other creations.
Fourth, probably my only complaint (and it's a small one) is that I feel for ANY restaurant that serves a lot of finger food, they should have hand sanitizer all over the place ... very accessible.  With that said, I did go to the bathroom to wash my hands.   :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a place to eat off of the strip, and found this place on Yelp. We arrived during happy hour, which was perfect for us.

The chips were good, and the salsa was very tasty. Their tacos were delicious, and the tortillas are freshly made. It was nice to have an affordable meal for once.

Great ambiance, great music, great service."}
{"text":"A great local find!  Good food, reasonable prices!  Try the bacon wrapped jalapeños, they were super yum and not spicy!"}
{"text":"Rating businesses on a 5-star system can be uncomfortable. We've been accustomed to thinking that only a 4-5 star restaurant is acceptable but please remember that 3-stars in YELP means \"A-OK\" which in my book, means I would return.

Came in Sunday afternoon for a quick bite to eat at the recommendation of a friend. Within our group of four, none of us had been there before but were all happy with the food. 

We had a couple of instances where our server may have gotten overwhelmed. We were her first table, but quickly picked up 3-5 more tables and that could have crossed her threshold of comfort. She was VERY sweet and we did not pressure her. From our table, three of us had been bartenders/servers so although we were understanding, our expectations were higher. 

Our guacamole was asked to be served without pumpkin seeds, it came with. We were given an additional guacamole as compensation. One of our tacos was asked to be served without the traditional flour tortilla, it came with the flour tortilla. There were just a few instances where our very specific dietary requests were not met. 

Regardless, the food was pretty decent. I was not impressed with their chicken taco but was very happy with the pork (had pineapple in it too). For the bigger eater, the bill can run a bit high than you might expect but you can tell this is absolutely a great spot for happy hour.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"For starters we had guacamole, queso fundido, and tortilla chips. There were 3 of us. Each had different entrées.. Tortilla soup with flour tortillas on the side, shrimp tacos, and mahi-mahi grilled fish tacos. We each the house specialty charro beans. Everything was excellent. Will return soon for their happy hour 3-6 Sun-Fri."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in all of Las Vegas. Not only is all of their food amazing, but the atmosphere is great as well. Located off of the Strip in a random strip mall, this place is definitely a local's spot. They have an amazing late night happy hour with tons of food and drink specials. Some of my favorite tacos are the al pastor and fish. The tacos are decently sized and come with handmade tortillas. However, the best part about this place is Techno Taco Tuesday. On Tuesday nights not only does this place have a happy hour, but they bring an entire party to their restaurant. They have great local DJs tear it up on the patio outside. I know it's hard to believe that you can find a great party at a Mexican restaurant, but trust me you should totally check it out. Can't wait to rage again at Techno Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. From the music to the food to the atmosphere. I came here with my husband for dinner and we were impressed upon walking into the place. We live in San Diego but were in Las Vegas celebrating our 10 year anniversary. We decided to come here in search of Mexican food. This restaurant did not disappoint, which is saying something since finding authentic Mexican food is pretty easy where we live. 
We ordered off the happy hour menu and got a variety of tacos plus the chips and salsa. The salsa tastes very fresh and the chips are delicious. The chicken tacos were so good. 
We loved the staff. Loved the music. Wish we could come back!"}
{"text":"When I want el pastor tacos and delicious drinks this is where you will find me!!  Not to mention, THE FAMOUS STEPHANIE works here over the weekend and that makes any place she's at superb beyond any unit of measure!!  The tortillas are made in house and they are soooo good!  The guacamole (topped with crab and mango) is unusual and yet so delightful!!  Try it!  Come here and eat tacos!!"}
{"text":"Food was delesious. Had the guacamole  with pomegranate seeds and pumpkin seeds. The tacos we had were tasty  and filling.   Wait staff was very attentive. We will be back."}

But we were looking for a GREAT place to eat and stumbled upon this restaurant called Tacos & Beer and WOW WHAT A FIND!!!

Nikki was our server and she made our experience one to remember!!  The food was amazing but bring your appetite because everything was awesome!!!  From the drinks to the homemade churros this place is our new favorite place to go to...

{"text":"Fantastic food, cheap as hell and awesome ambience. DEFINITELY coming back!! Got the fish taco (mouthful of tender fish and limey awesomeness) and the beef barbacoa taco (not a better way to my heart than putting mashed potatoes in my taco). A++"}
{"text":"The parking lot was packed on a weekday, but we were determined to get tacos. Tables were full on the patio, but there was plenty of space inside and Franco took great care of us while we were dining. Super friendly and attentive and always making sure I had a full drink. Love that.

The Paloma I had was delicious, but not the best I've had. I forgot to ask if they squeeze the grapefruit juice in house, but it didn't taste as fresh as I would have liked. Good, not great.

The tacos were delicious for the tortillas alone. I had the best view watching the gal making them, from scratch. Makes all the difference. 

Jackfruit carnitas
Al pastor
Crunchy beef with mashed potatoes 

Good tacos, great tortillas. 

Catch me there next time, hopefully on the patio."}
{"text":"Tacos and Beer delivers. Thank you Alan for your hospitality, excellent food, and great beer...don't change a thing!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here as date night, great choice!  We were immediately served water and chips and salsa which was nice to snack on while we decided what to order.  We started with an appetizer of guacamole which was a great choice.  It had just the right amount of creaminess and lime.  I tried the Fish tacos which were grilled Mahi-Mahi with a mango salsa.  Very good.  We also had the shrimp taco, the Baja fish, and my wife's favorite, the bean and cheese.  It was made with a soft corn tortilla, beans, cheese, and some fresh veggies on top.  As simple as it was it was full of flavor.  We also particularly enjoyed the cilantro lime rice.  Overall the staff was friendly and helpful and made sure we had enough beer at all times.  Great menu and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great service. 
Appetizer we ordered
Chips & salsa (red and green) regular tasting chips, the salsas were good but not spicy (which I didn't mind) and not watery.
Asada fries(no pico by choice) it was a small plate but still shareable portion for atleast 2 ppl or 4 in our case bc we had the chips and salsa as well. 

Chicken Tortilla soup - definitely recommend.

The tacos are folded and STUFFED. They are not huge but so flavorful.
We ordered a few different kinds of tacos
Carnitas, chicken, fish, Asada, chicken/potato. 
I love that the carnitas came with chicharones on top of it.
I ordered a side salad with my 2 tacos. I thought it was weird when the waiter didn't ask what dressing I wanted, so when it came out with green salsa and Mexican cheese crumbles I didn't think I would like it. But it was surprisingly good! I even added on top of my tacos. 

Anyways, this was the 2nd time we've come here and never regret it. 

Service is 100% perfect. Always checking on you and someone is always refilling the waters."}
{"text":"Stopped in with some friends after we couldnt decide on where to eat, place is amazing, clean, really awesome staff and the food is really legit. Definitely better than most stuff on the strip. The homemade sauces are incredible and a cool thing about the spot. Beer was cold!!"}
{"text":"Really good taco place off the strip. The shrimp and chicken Tinga tacos were definitely my favorite. I would highly recommend their micheladas. They have the largest selection of mescal I've ever seen."}
{"text":"this place is so awesome. I absolutely loved the customer service and the drinks are yummy just like the food.  sadly I came here on my last day in Vegas, but I really enjoyed it, next time I come to Vegas I'm definitely returning here!"}

{"text":"Hands down this place  the place to get tacos. I had the cochinita Pibil and the rajas con crema. The flavors are so delicious.portion sizes are great too. This place is also family friendly.my kids love the crunchy chicken tacos. Armando is 100% on his customer service  game and the staff is also very attentive . Our waitress Ciara  was completely awesome . One more thing the desert. My kids love the Chaco taco the order comes with 2 ."}
{"text":"I liked this place.
Great taco's.
Great selection of Beer.
Good, quick service.
Nice interior.  Good music posters on the wall (Sonic Youth, Sebadoh, Dinosaur Jr.)
I'm gonna go again, next time in town."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! :) My friend and I got off of work and were looking for a new place to have a few drinks. I saw the Tacos and Beer sign and the appeal was instant. 

The place itself has a great ambiance. Very welcoming and bartender was friendly. The food was great. I had to order more.. I had the beef adobado and the green pork. I also had the beer batter fish. Yum!!!  Margarita was delicious! I love the salt foam with tajin. that adds a great kick to it. Nachos were not all that great though.

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is due to the Happy Hour menu was extremely limited. There is a great selection of beer and hoped there would be more options on the HH menu. Just four taco options. I had to order off the HH menu to get a variety of tacos. Also the bartenders were friendly but the rest of the staff was not welcoming at all. Sitting near the service bar, all I heard were the servers taking bad about their tables. I thought that was a bit unprofessional. 

Regardless, I would absolutely recommend it to my friends!"}
{"text":"I was walking by and saw this place open. I seen it on Google maps 2 weeks ago and said I'll have to see what this is all about.
I thought the name was unimaginative and thought it must be a dive.
BOY WAS I WRONG! 
The decor was/is very welcoming. An upscale place. Where you can fit in with a Chevy shirt and jeans.... sitting around nice dressed folks.

I had a small appetite tonight, so I ordered the chiquito taco platter.  (Small tacos)
You can mix up the flavors. I had the 1/2 dozen (by waitresses recomendation) carnitas, BBQ beef, and the been and cheese.

All were good.  But I'm a sucker for carnitas.  So those were the favorite. 

The waitress, Mandee and server in training, David were very polite. Mandee was very attentive in her service.  Not only with me but with all her customers. Definitely a very seasoned waitress or just plain rocking the customer service!  David was very personable as well. I think he'll fit in well with this group. 

The hostess was very friendly and got me a table very quick. (Was fairly busy night on a Monday too)

Now the creme' de' la creme'.....
I absolutely despise guacamole.  Hate it with a passion.  But I ordered the chips n salsa.
Out it came w the, assumed normal guacamole n salsa.
No.... I thought let's just taste the green stuff. (My grandma always said just try 1st then judge) So I do.....and wow. All I can say at my 1st bite. The \" tomatillo-avacado salsa\" was amazing!!!!
A hint of spice with a little salt paired superbly with the chips.

Since I moved to town from Montana days ago..... I think I found my \"spot\". Next I'll have to sit at the bar and try to see how the mixologist fairs.

Lastly..... enjoy folks. You won't be disappointed!

{"text":"Enchiladas and mimosas. Burritos and bloody Mary's. Tostadas and Martinis. These are all Mexican food and alcohol combinations that you're not going to be eating here, because when a place is called tacos and beer then you better order some tacos and beer. Capiche? Now when I hear tacos and beer, I was expecting a tiny little place with 3 types of tacos and some cervezas. I walk into this place and was immediately taco slapped in the nostrils with some sweet sweet smells. Me and my crew had tacos going up..on a Tuesday and these tacos so good, we ain't choosy. These tacos here are well made you can tell they pay attention to detail. My two favorites were the chicken tinga and the al pastor. I also got to try the shrimp, the fish and carne Asada. All sorts of delicious and I can honestly say this was the first time I've had mashed potatoes in a burrito, so I tip my sombrero to you. 
As you, my astute reader, have noticed, I haven't mentioned the beer part of tacos and beer. Worry not, because they hold it down. I expected a few beers, but this place had a whole book for beers, I only got to down a few IPAs and some tequila shots, because when life hands you lemons, pretend they're limes and do tequila shots. If you're a beer nerd then come right on down
They have a few other menu items like tamales and enchiladas, and they offer margaritas. I didn't get to try them and I'm not bothered because if you come to a place named tacos and beer then you damn well better order some tacos and beer"}
{"text":"I hate cilantro but their guacamole was so good I got over it. Had fish and shrimp tacos, so tasty. This is my bestfriend's fav spot when ever we travel to Vegas, finally got to eat lunch here and I was impressed.

Only 4 stars coz I asked for no dairy or cilantro for allergy reasons and I wasnt offered a substitute. Bummer but food was good enough to not complain since I know my dietary restrictions sometimes can kill it."}
{"text":"The food was AHHmazing. Fast service and nice staff. I went 2x in one week . The happy hour is the best deal yet. My order got mixed up easy mistake and no questions asked was corrected immediately."}
{"text":"Ridiculous. They've been open for at least a couple months now, and they're operating as if they'd thrown together a crew of teenagers last night to open today.

We stood at the front for 3-4 mins near the absent hostess table before we began to be greeted. I say \"began\" because before she was even finished with her sentence, the person who greeted us promptly turned around and walked off talking to another worker.

A minute later someone else hesitantly approached us, and the first girl came back and addressed him as if we weren't there: \"can you seat them?\" He did; left & came back only seconds later to take drink orders, and since we hadn't had time to walk up to the bar & look at the current beer selection (the taps change & their waiters evidently don't bother memorizing what's there), he disappeared for a while.

He finally reemerged, took our drink orders, said \"that's it?\" and in the 4 secs it took us process & say \"um, just to drink, yeah, but food wise...\" he was gone again. He didn't come back until later in the evening. I say \"evening\" because the whole experience of ordering & receiving 2 drinks & 4 tacos took nearly two hours.

A different guy walked over 10-15 mins later and asked if we were OK. I told him we wanted to order food, to which he replied, \"oh, I'm just filling in, I'll be back.\" Why did you ask if you weren't expecting to have to do anything about it? To his credit, he did come right back and take our order, and you could tell that he probably had just been called over from Firefly to help out; he was the most communicative out of all the employees we encountered. He checked on our still absent drinks for us and apologized for the wait.

Meanwhile, it was still 30 mins or so before 2 of our 4 tacos were finally delivered. It was another 10-15 mins or so before someone else (who'd also apparently just arrived) came by and asked how we were doing. I said we were still waiting on half our order, and he went to check on it. It was another several mins before the other two got delivered -- and one was missing half of the ingredients the menu said came on it. I finally got someone's attention and let them know. He brought it back to the kitchen window, where one of the cooks dumped a small dollop of salsa & avocado pieces on it, & it was brought back and put in front of me by the first waiter kid, who turned & left again without so much as an apology.

By this time I'm kind of over it all, so when the guy who also apparently just got there came back over to ask how everything was, I told him how there'd been several misses over the course of our time there and I really couldn't see myself coming back. He apologized & said he'd just gotten there (yeah, I gathered that much), and next time he came by he said he'd take care of our food. The 4 tacos cost less than our 2 drinks, so I guess that's good for them.

Food-wise, it was meh. Salsa was decent, but had no spice at all. Chips OK. The veggie and the beans & cheese tacos were pretty good; the baja & chicken tinga tacos, not so much. All together, food would have been a solid 3 stars, & beer selection is decent. The myriad customer service faults dropped it to 1 star. Raised to 2 stars because at least the dude comped the food part of our bill, & one of the other dudes had brought us a second thing of chips & salsa because our food was taking so long."}
{"text":"Seriously. Seriously. This place. I just can't. Their food if stoopid fantastic. I actively have to talk myself out of going sometimes cause I would be there everyday (I do go once a week though). By far my favorite restaurant in Vegas. I've tried about 1/2 of the menu so far (only half because I have some favorites that I HAVE to have when I'm there) and everything has been amazing. I will warn you though...if you are considering the Carne Asada Fries...prepare to share or take some home...it's massive. If you are visiting Vegas - it's so worth the Uber or the cab cost to taste this place!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out. Food was all pretty good. Tacos were a good size and all the ones I tried out had good flavor. The tortillas were so fresh and authentic, delicious! We all shared a margarita pitcher which was also good. Only thing was service was ok at best. But I think since grat was included, he really didn't worry about us that much. Sat at table for 10-15 minutes before being asked for drinks. The place was steady but not busy enough for that type of service. Would def come back and try them again."}
{"text":"Went back again and they messed up my order - twice.  Only giving it 3 stars since they gave me a $10 gift card as a courtesy, but I haven't been back yet."}
{"text":"Really refreshing take on Mexican food!  The ingredients are super fresh u can tell and great quality of food.  Prices are totally reasonable and the staff is super nice!  Very helpful and friendly!  I think I've even met the owner a few times and she is very nice as well.  My new favorite spot near work.  Can't wait to celebrate cinco de mayo here tonight!

PS - even better is that I just 2 free tacos cus the kitchen made some extra..not too shabby!"}
{"text":"Came with a groupon that I paid 16.00 for( with a promo code).  The groupon was for 6 tacos, 1 quacamole, and 2 sides.  

The guac was great, though I wasnt a fan of the chips.  They tasted store-bought, nothing fantastic.  Its a shame since they're making homemade tortillas for the tacos.  

My wife had 3 carne asada tacos.  She enjoyed them.  I had a shrimp, a baja fish and a chicken tinga.  I loved the baja fish, probably my favorite.  The chicken tinga was good too.  I wasnt a fan of the shrimp.  The shrimp were chopped up into tiny pieces and they were served on a huge flour tortilla.  The tortilla totally overwhelmed the small amount of shrimp.  The rice and whole black beans were good, very small portions of the sides.  

We left full so all in all a good value.  Not sure if I'd pay 4.00 for the fish taco, or 3.00 for a chicken taco."}
{"text":"I was expecting good tacos but WOW I was extremely impressed. We ordered al pastor,  carne asada, Baja fish, cochina pork and another pork taco that I can't recall the name of and lengua.  We also ordered the beans and grilled Jalepenos....those sides were the cherry on top. They're not your typical beans that's for sure. I can probably eat two  orders to myself (no shame, they were that delicious) they also have a nice selection of craft  beer, so that's definitely a plus. I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Loved the tacos...especially the Carne asada with the jalapeño salsa.  Guacamole was something to write home about too!  Loved the chill ambience and music...altogether a great experience away from Vegas bustle."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night and it was popping but not busy. I was able to secure a table on the patio as soon as I walked up which was cool since it was a nice night out. Service was a little slow at first but they redeemed themselves after. Now I can see why people rave about the tacos. They were fricken bomb! I was expecting them to be as good as everyone said and  they were right. The margaritas were really good to and I'd love to go back and take advantage of the $5 dollar margaritas. Good job Imperial Tacos! Aplausos!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and decent cocktails, sat at the bar. service is lacking though, disappointing. Slow and disinterested, not welcoming for the most part."}
{"text":"My flight got canceled due to the surprise snow storm of March 2017, but it meant that I could stay an extra day and catch the legendary Techno Taco Tuesday. I'm so glad I could.

As a beer fiend, I was definitely excited about the draft beer menu. There's something here for everyone, and they feature a lot of very good beers per style. I didn't check out the bottles list, but I did see it was large and likely also nicely curated.

Wait for a table at 10 was an hour, but we got a seat after about 40 minutes. It was very hard to pick tacos since they all sounded so good. My favorites were the baja fish and al pastor. The quantity for the price was pretty good, I ca think, at least compared to some other taco places I've visited while in Vegas.

The TTT event itself was a lot of fun ($5 cover). I was impressed by the line up, and really dug the DJs, especially the dark techno. The headliner, Hito, got on at 1am, and she vitalized the packed crowd. Generally, other patrons were courteous and not too pushy, though some people commanded a large space for their dancing. Nonetheless, it was a memorable night and a great spot to dance with locals. The vibe is truly \"come as you are\" and mostly in their 20s.

Definitely check out this spot for the techno scene and some delicious drinks and eats."}
{"text":"Everything we ate was delicious and the prices don't leave any regret. 

Our group ate just about every taco server, a plate of nachos, and the enchiladas. All were pleased. We were actually shocked by the price point of everything. 

Definitely recommend and will return."}
