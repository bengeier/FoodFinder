{"text":"A quick lunch stop for Chicken Parm and it was delicious! Healthy portion size, tasty sauce all promptly served. The seating area was spotless and the wait staff kind and courteous. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"We visited Abruzzi in Irwin for the first time, and most likely the last time.  The service was fine, very attentive and quick.  The food wasn't bad, it tasted OK, but the quality of the veal that we had was pretty bad.  It was pounded EXTREMELY thin, which made it very tough.  The waitress had informed us that the veal was \"real\" and very good so two of us ordered it.  BIG mistake.  As I said, the taste was ok, due to the sauce and cheese, but the veal was way too thin. The waitress asked us how we liked it and I had to be honest and say it was tough and too thin.  She seemed concerned and actually took a piece of the veal back to the kitchen.  She returned to tell us that its \"supposed\" to be that way.  If it was supposed to look like a piece of lunchmeat then I suppose the chef knows best, but I have NEVER had a piece of veal that looked more like a slice of lunchmeat than a piece of \"real\" veal.  I wonder, would they serve a piece of sliced roast beef luncheon meat and call it prime rib?  I would hope not.  Even though she informed us that the chef said the veal was \"supposed\" to be like that he did offer us a free dessert.  That was ok but a sincere apology and acknowledgement that someone went overboard with the meat tenderizer would have gone a long way in possibly prompting us to return and give Abruzzi another chance.  Instead we got a piece of cheesecake and probably wont return."}
{"text":"I tried this place last night with a friend and it was so delicious! 

We are bored with the normal places in NHT and wanted to try something different so Abruzzi is was. 

Inside is very neat and clean. I love the interior. 

The staff We encountered was very friendly. 


We arrived after the dinner crowd was gone and were seated immediately. Our waitress was super nice and very helpful with the menu and making decisions a little easier. 


I had Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and a salad.  I tried the homemade balsamic dressing for the salad and it was great! 
I'm very peculiar about ordering pasta anyplace because it never seems to be made right, but this was perfect to me! 

My friend had the manicotti with 2 giant meatballs and wedding soup.
She really enjoyed the soup since not a lot of places make it right, and her manicotti and meatballs were also quite delicious. 


We will definitely go back and try other things from their menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. I had chicken parmigiana. 
Was very good and super reasonable. Staff was very friendly, nice atmosphere. Also had take out from there. I would recommend them for some good Italian food."}
{"text":"A total waste of $50.  My husband and I went here for dinner a few weeks ago and were less than impressed.   The restaurant is very dark and cold inside.  We sat at a table near the bar and our server couldn't have cared less about us.  We stuck around because we had already put in our dinner orders and didn't want to be rude.  After all, maybe they have great food, right? WRONG.  I got a bowtie pasta dish with chicken that looked really good on the menu. When I got the food it literally tasted like someone ashed their cigarette right in the food. I asked the server about it and she said it was \"supposed to taste like that\" and said that I was probably just taking the grilled chicken.  1. Not one piece of chicken was browned, grilled, blackened, etc.  It looked like limp strips of processed chicken.  There wasn't a trace of grilled anything. 2.  NOTHING is supposed to taste like that did.  It was so bad that I couldn't even pick around the chicken and eat the noodles because everything had the same gross taste.   Never going back to this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch. Had the chicken salad and wedding soup. Both fantastic. Soup reminded my of my grandmothers. I was told to try the homemade cheesecake. Best I've ever had. I ate in the bar area and Don, the bar manager was very personable and helpful."}
{"text":"I am originally from this area and usually have lunch with my family before I leave.  All 6 of us enjoyed our lunches: soup, salad, pasta, fish sandwich, Fettuccini Alfredo, and Pasta Diablo.  The prices are reasonable and good variety on the menu.  Service was polite and prompt."}
{"text":"Abruzzi's has quickly become my go to restaurant in the Irwin area. From the phenomenal and wide food selection, to the friendly and attentive staff, this restaurant is exactly what the area needed to veer away from the chain restaurants and overly plentiful fast food options all around us. With each visit, their homemade, warm bread always comes to the table first to get your meal started. After browsing their menu, you can clearly see the hardwork that goes on in the kitchen by reading that their pizza dough, sauces, soups, salad dressings, and even desserts are all homemade and crafted with much care. (Do not pass up the opportunity to try their balsamic vinaigrette dressing, you won't regret it.) Additionally, I look forward to their monthly drink specials...they are always creative and fun concoctions. Speaking of alcohol, I've been told that their sangria, both the red and the white, are also a homemade recipe....I wish it was sold there to take out by the gallon. The staff has always been quick, attentive, and caring..the owner even frequently comes around to talk with the customers and to get their feedback, showing that the patrons opinions truly matter and are heard.

Whether you're by yourself, on a hot date, or out with a group of your friends and family, give Abruzzi's a try!! And if you don't feel like steppin' out, there's always the take out option ;)"}
{"text":"We ate here last night to celebrate eating there 1 year ago today... yes a silly anniversary but I didn't want to cook. This was our 3rd visit and we were not disappointed. First -- the staff....always super friendly and honest. I hate the way some restaurant staff always upscale. That's not what you'll get here. The wait staff are truly nice and give a real opinion! Our waitress suggested apps that we hadn't tried before- sausage stuffed peppers and mac-n-cheese carbonara. Both were yummy but the peppers were my favorite. Flavorful but not too spicy. Plenty of cheesy goodness. I couldn't resist getting the pasta Amata. It was creamy bowtie pasta with chicken, roasted red peppers and peas. Delish!! Hubby got the fish sandwich with fries. The fish was so tender it melted in your mouth. The fries were just fries. Overall this is a great place to go to. We hear their pizza is great but we've never had it. maybe the next time we go and celebrate a silly anniversary. :-)"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. That's food is really good and it has really good service. The best place to eat ever. The wedding soup is sooooooooo good"}
{"text":"My husband and I had to cancel our Valentine's Day dinner reservations due to inclement weather.  Instead, we decided to stay local and visited Abruzzi's.  The restaurant was not at all crowded (which we thought was due to the weather), and we were the only ones in the lobby waiting to be seated.  After the hostess walked past us twice, she finally acknowledged us and asked if we wanted a table or a booth.  We chose a booth and were seated at the first one directly behind the hostess station and near the staff entry/exit to the kitchen.  The menus still list the old restaurant name, Amatos, and were supplemented with paper inserts to display the updated menu (even though this restaurant just recently opened).  As we reviewed the menu, two servers and the hostess walked past our table multiple times.  We decided on our drink and entree selections and placed our menus at the end of the table to signal that we were ready to order.  While waiting, I noticed that the tables around us were receiving drinks, food, and their checks...but still, no server came to our table and there was no manager in sight.  After ten minutes of waiting, we put on our coats to leave.  As we were walking out, my husband informed the hostess that we had been waiting for ten minutes and were leaving since we've yet to receive service.   The hostess actually asked my husband where we were seated!

This restaurant is within walking distance of our home and had the potential to be a 'go to'.  After this experience, we never plan to visit again.  This place advertises as an \"Italian Cucina\", but fails to properly hire and train professional staff that reflect a welcoming, family style restaurant.  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Food was not good. Tasted old and reheated. The food didn't have any taste. The restaurant was very small. Very long wait time and the food was over priced for such poor quality. Would not recommend going there."}
{"text":"So my wife and I pass by here all the time and say, we have to stop by and check that place out. Well we did and we ate our 33rd annual meal there, aka Anniversary. 

What a pleasant surprise! I called to see if they took reservations and they do but you really don't need one. 
We were seated right away 15 minutes before our res. 

Our server Dottie was so delightful! When asked if I could have oil and vinegar on my salad she replied would you like to try our balsamic vinaigrette? It our own?
I immediately thought yes, why didn't I think of that!
It was very good! We even put some in the dipping oil served with the warm fresh dinner bread. 

The service was outstanding the menu was right on and the food was well portioned and excellent!!
We both enjoyed the eve and decided this is a new spot that we will definitely return to. Although there are other places closer, we felt that this place had that special charm about it. 
Thank you for making our annual dinner date one to remember."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight.  Prices are about the same as you see at most Italian restaurants.  I got the Taste of Italy.  I got wedding soup.  It was bland.  Campbell's tastes better, and Campbell's isn't that good.  Chicken Parm was actually pretty tasty.  It was nice and juicy, and had a ton of cheese on it.  Lasagna was decent.  Nothing I'd ever want to get by itself as a meal, but it was ok.  Fettuccine Alfredo was gross.  I mean it just tasted terrible.  Seemed like a lot of people were getting pizza.  It looked pretty good, but we didn't try it.  Also, service was great.  I know some other reviewers said service was bad, but seems like they worked the kinks out.  If I ever went back, I'd probably skip the meals and go straight for the pizza."}
{"text":"So food is great. Had a Chicago style pizza. So it's basically same owner as brick house. And one of the Luchino brothers. Menu and food seems to be same as Luchino's. But hey we don't have to drive to white oak or pt no more."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed their pasta, but the last couple times it sucked! Quality really went downhill! Time to find another pasta joint in the area!"}
{"text":"My wife found this place somehow, and we decided to try it. We've been back twice since, and both those times in the same week-once for a birthday dinner for her brother and sister-in-law. 

The servers are very attentive and our last one was quite good and friendly. As for the food, it depends on your taste. My wife loved the wedding soup (though one day it was a bit too salty) and, while she found the calzones okay, she really enjoyed the fettuccini alfredo. She prefers sausage to the menu items (chicken and shrimp) which they did for her. This also resulted in two meals, there and a sizable leftover so the portions are great. 

I liked the chicken marsala well enough but my go-to meal will likely be the crab cakes, which are exceptional. There is also a single crab cake appetizer so if you want to try it alongside your regular entree, there is that option.

The salad and bread dipped in oil and herbs are also very good, so if you are looking for a great meal in an informal setting, this is an ideal choice."}
{"text":"First off, name is confusing. On Yelp it's \"Amato's Italian Cucina\" twice, but the sign and menu reads \"Abruzzi\" so I'm not really sure what it's going on.  

In my experience, a great way to distinguish between an excellent Italian Restaurant and an average Italian Restaurant, is to try the most basic of American-Italian dish's, Spaghetti and Meatballs. Abruzzi does not pass the test. The noodles tasted like they were store-bought. The sauce was horrible, very watery and did not stick to the noodles at all (Might be good on pizza, but not pasta). However, the meatballs were pretty good, seasoned well and had really good flavor. 

The second time I went, I tried the Alfredo, which was very good. I also opted for the Wedding Soup instead of the salad and was very happy because it was very good. We got the tiramisu to-go which was great, the custard was pretty much the best around, but it was veryyy wet so it did not hold up on the drive home. 

The reason for the 2 stars is because the staff was pretty horrendous. When I arrived, my boyfriend and I were the only two in the waiting area. Nobody even looked over to us to see if anyone new had come in- the teenager hostess seemed to be too busy texting- so we stood there waiting for 15 min for no reason (there were at least 5 open tables). 
Our waitress was pretty bad too: not friendly, didn't really pay attention to our drinks and never asked us how our food was. She also seemed to be much more attentive to her cell phone and co-worker friends rather than doing her job. 

How about management hire more mature employees or make sure your staff isn't texting on the job."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this restaurant months ago.  Unfortunately, the rudest waitress ruined the experience for us.  We brought this to the  attention of the owner.  I did not get the feeling he really cared.  He seemed more interested to see if we wanted something comped, which we did not.  Will never return."}
{"text":"Most amazing pizza! Esp the white pizza. And best chicken salad and balsamic dressing ever!  Cheesecake is homemade and prob best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed with the food and service is decent. One of the best pizza places in the area and reasonably priced. Comfortable setting. Only reason don't give it 5 stars is the girl at the front that seats you isn't very friendly, often feel like we're bothering her for a seat and she'd rather be on her phone."}
{"text":"The draft beers were priced very fairly at 2.95 for Miller Lite and 4.95 for Peroni. Service was fast, almost a little rushed. The house salad was better than I expected, and the homemade dressings were a nice touch. The bread was just okay in my opinion. It would have been much better if served hot rather than warm. I had the manicotti, which was decent. Another person had the eggplant parm and said it was delicious. Someone else had the fettuccini alfredo and said that it was pretty bland."}
{"text":"This had to be the worst experience I've had at a restaurant in 10 years The Chicago deep dish pizza came out looking like a Pizza Hut Pan pizza With less flavor  Waitress was extremely nice management on the other hand have a lot to be desired definitely will not return"}
{"text":"Another spot that has been on my watch list to try.  It looks so inviting all the times I have driven past it, but I am usually on another mission and can't stop in.  Up until today,  I didn't have feedback from anyone else who has tried it, so I wasn't sure if the place was just all looks and nothing more. 

Meeting up with a friend gave me the opportunity to see for myself.  The location is pretty convenient, and there is ample parking, thanks to another lot off to the side.

The interior and exterior looks very inviting and classy. The dining area is spacious, comfortable, and relaxing.  Plenty of room between patrons to allow for a decent conversation to occur.

Our server was very friendly and cheerful as she explained the menu.  They list lunch and dinner pricing next to each menu item. Menu features pizza,(4 different sizes and 10 different styles and flavors)  I noticed an option to add ricotta cheese to your pizza. 8 different calzones, including a tuna calzone!  Never heard of that.  Menu is pretty extensive and features chicken, veal and seafood dinners, open faced sandwiches, hoagies, house specialties, (lobster ravioli with vodka cream sauce ) 14 different appetizers, soups and salads. Pretty decent options.

I decided to order your standard meatball hoagie.  However, when it was served to me, I noticed it wasn't a \"meatball\" hoagie.  It was more like a crushed up meatball hoagie because there were chunks of meat all over the bun.  The first bite indicated that it tasted exactly like a meatball hoagie but minus the round balls of meat I generally expect.  The bun was great, the amount of sauce was just right, and the crunch of the bun made me forget all about the original appearance of it all.  So much so, that I never even asked the server if this was the norm!  All the more reason to go back and see if its the same, and to try a slice of the homemade cheesecake!
Prices are reasonable and they offer a child's menu for those 12 and under."}
{"text":"This place is rubbish. Chicago style pizza came out looking exactly the same as a 7 dollar carry out for 20 dollars. The 7 dollar pizza has more flavor. This tasted like a shoe box with cheese. They are a Olive garden wanna be. Will not return"}
{"text":"1st off it is not Amato's it is Abruzzi Italian Cucina, and anytime a place plays the name game... something fishy is going on! 

With that said, Décor is nice and I love the chandelier when you walk in. Our waiter was great! The wedding soup was also very good, And that's all the pros.

We ordered the firecracker drink witch is mostly just Vodka with sprinkles. I had the chicken masala which I specifically ordered \"well done\".  It took a very long time for our food, my friend had the lasagna. But I assumed it was because I ordered the chicken well done.  Unfortunately as soon as I took a bite of my food I knew it... the chicken was still raw~! In my book, regardless of anything else... If you can't at least cook the food so people don't get sick then its an automatic FAIL!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, great atmosphere. Try the pizza! Bread with dipping oil is a delicious starter."}
{"text":"I went here with my father last week.  The hostess was friendly and I really loved the atmosphere.  Music was what I would hope from an Italian restaurant (oldies/Italian).  The decor was really neat and I loved what they did to the walls.

The food was really good!  I liked how they served bread with dipping oil.  I ordered the spinach ravioli with pesto sauce - it was great.  My father ordered the pasta e olio, which he also enjoyed.  It came with soup or salad - the salad was good.

The only thing we didn't really like was our waitress was not very friendly.  She was never rude, but it was like she was doing a job.  I know work is work, but if she just acted like she was happy to have us, that would have made the experience much better.  My father remarked it seemed like she had \"attitude.\"

I would like to go back, though, to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Went last week for date night. I really like the atmosphere here. We started off with a bruschetta flatbread..so good! (In fact, we ordered one to go too.) The chicken & veal parm were delicious too. Only downfall was I didn't care for the parmesan  dressing & I don't like balsamic vinegar. (Only options) Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. The service was horrendous. That was just the start. The bread tastes like it was a month old. What 
Italian restaurant has awful bread??  They are starting with a limited menu and can't even do that right. Another pizza joint with crap service for Irwin. Great."}
{"text":"The four of us all had excellent dinners on Saturday, June 16, 2018. Each had something different but agreed all were delicious.  Service was great too."}
{"text":"Been there twice now food is incredible , this is my favorite place . Service has been great so far . I will be back"}
{"text":"Abruzzi is an great addition to the sparse dining options here in Irwin. Arrived at 830 for dinner with my wife and a friend. The place was busy but not crowded. 

The decor is modern, tasteful and well done. The wait was about 25 minutes, just enough to get a drink. The bar is undersized but that's understandable for the space. The bartender was nice and attentive. 

The waitstaff was quick and attentive once we were seated, drinks quick and waters all around without asking. The noise in the dining area was pretty low save for an unruly child's screaming and parents unwilling to take control. 

Olive oil with an herb and spice Parmesan complimented the fresh bread served. Honestly I was impressed by the bread it was perfect, dense, crusty, and honestly I had to hold back from eating all of it. H

Meal was timely and well portioned. I had the Diablo pasta while my wife had the spinach ravioli. My pasta was great, spicy, saucy, al dente and well spiced. Her ravioli were well done with a nice pesto which she loved. 

The serving plates were plain and unattractive. My pasta was in a handled dish which was weird and my friends crab cake was just sitting on a plate with no garnish of any kind. It was the worst part of the meal. Presentation means something and the presentation was poor.  This is the reason for my 4 star rating. 

I'm ordering pizza from there now."}
{"text":"Everything about our first time visit was wonderful and we will definitely be going back.  Our waitress, Jenny was awesome!  Recommended a beer when I couldn't decide- and she nailed it.  She was attentive and so helpful with recommendations.  The food was just amazing. They must have a killer marinara  sauce recipe.  I loved the eggplant parm and my husband loved his meatball hoagie. And we both loved the zucchini fritters. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Horrible service, bartenders do not know how to make drinks, also they wait on tables so you as a customer sitting at bar get completely neglected.  When you finish you drink be prepared to wait for a good 10 minutes because the bartender leaves and goes and waits on tables, unreal. The bad thing is the bar only has like 5 chairs so even if your the only person sitting there you still get crapy service, the owner should be ashamed of himself , either take the bar out or make your bartender do her job and stay at the bar, how hard is that to do, or close your restaurant if your that incompetent and do not know how to run it properly"}
{"text":"Service was slow. Sauce was good. For an Italian place not bad would eat there again. Portions are huge. Especially the lunch portions."}
{"text":"In a town full of Italian food this one is good. Large portions, great flavors and monthly specials. Good drinks and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Service was poor. 
Food was okay. 
If you want Italian in this area, there are better places to go."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times this year and this place has does not disappoint. The service is great, the food is amazing, and the atmosphere is comfy and relaxed. This last trip our server was very knowledgeable and friendly, our food came out quicker than we had expected and was really good. I frequent the Irwin area and it certainly is at the top of my list for dinning options."}
