{"text":"We decided to go to Nau-ti-gal for restaurant week because they had a Key West themed dinner set and we were married in Key West exactly three months prior. We decided to make reservations since we figured it would be busy. When we called we were told the only opening they had was for 7:45 on a Thursday night. I thought that was odd but we booked it anyway.  We showed up around 7:15 for our reservation. Figured we could get a drink and maybe the table would be ready early. When we arrived, we noticed many tables available for inside dining. We gave them our name for the reservation and immediately the woman told us \"No, we don't have your reservation.\" We were shocked but told them to put us on a wait list to sit outdoors for dining. We were told it would be about a half hour. She also preceded to tell us we probably called the wrong number and made reservation at the Mariner.  We sat at the outside bar and ordered drinks. We thought we had made reservations so we decided to call the number we called the day before to cancel the reservation if we had indeed made them at the mariner. When my husband called the host at Natuigal answered. Nope! we had called the correct number and yes, you didn't keep our reservation.   We had barely gotten our drinks when we were buzzed for our table. I went back to the hostess and told her we were buzzed. She then told me to walk outside and find a staff member who would seat me. What?!?!? isn't that the entire job description of the hostess? to seat you? I walked outside and tried to find someone, who I had never met, to seat me. I found a bunch of servers and a woman who seemed \"managerial\". I told her I was buzzed and I was to find someone to seat me. She was extremely rude and asked \"where is my buzzer, and how many people?\" She rudely walked us to a table.   Then we had the either most stoned or clueless waiter I've ever come across. SLOW and HORRIBLE.   We each ordered off the restaurant week menu. HORRIBLE food. Shrimp extremely overcooked. Grouper with crab from a CAN. Come on! Side of vegetable was clearly a frozen vegetable mix. It's summer, get some fresh vegetables! Clam chowder was watery and not as tasty. We've had it at Captn Bills so we know how good it can be. not worth the $25.   Would only go back for drinks to sit outside and listen to the band. If I ever go back."}
{"text":"Had Easter Brunch here today.  We had a 1:45 Reservation and we arrived at 1:30.  When we arrived I walked around to check out the buffet.  This is not your normal buffet.  It is set up in the bar and booths around the bar.  We were seated in a small room and our server stopped and explained the Buffet and got our drink order.  I ordered a Bloody Mary (more on that later).  We went and got our plates off the booth seat (Really?)  and ordered omelets from the Omelet bar.  There were wonderful.  My wife liked these French fry things that they had.  The French Toast was good as well.  The Prime Rib was too rare for our tastes and the Peel and Eat shrimp was peppery.    Overall the food was good, but I am not sure we would go back for brunch.  Pretty expensive at $26/person.  Back to the Bloody Mary.  I think it had a tablespoon of Celery salt and too much Worcestershire Sauce.  I guess according to the server they make their own Bloody Mary mix.  They can keep it if you ask me.  I would have comped the drink as I informed the server that it was to my liking and I didn't drink that much of it, but that's just me.  I should have returned it.  IN her defense she did ask me if I wanted something else, but I am not sure if I would have had to pay for it or it would have been instead of?  Overall an OK experience, but as stated before, I am not sure I would return for brunch."}
{"text":"I've given this place WAY too many chances.  I always think \"this is the time they impress me\".  My food has been meh to terrible.  The best part is the cookie dough and the ambiance.  In the summer, it is really fun to pull up on a boat, sit outside, or listen to a band.  I am only going back for drinks and music in the future.  The food has failed me too many times!"}
{"text":"Gone down hill big time I have gone to this restaurant many times in my life. In the 60's it was a tavern and bait shop that had boat rental. I had not been to the Nau-Ti-Gal for years, and when my daughter and her BF came up from FL for Christmas we decided to take them there as it is a unique location and I in the past the food was pretty good. Saturday 12/27/14  we got there at 6:30 and the place was dead, which I thought a little odd. My wife ordered the seafood salad, my daughter, her BF and I ordered the Prime Rib special of the night, each meal came with a cup of clam chowder. My wifes seafood salad consided of canned baby shrimp, and canned crab meat on lettuce and tomatoes. The Prime Rib was a dark red color which I later realized was a Sam's pre-cooked Prime, I've had before. Later that night I got a gut ache, which turned into several trips to the bathroom, my wife got it the next morning, I'm thinking it was the chowder.  I won't be going back to the Nau-Ti-Gal and would not recommend to anyone else..."}
{"text":"Woah. Have not had that bad of an experience in a restaurant ever. Where to start??  Besides the bar staff, it was abominable. The whole wait staff seemed to be high schoolers that just don't care. It took forever to get service and order then we waited over an hour for our food. Not once did our server let us know what was happening or apologize.  When the food came it was ok, we were disappointed there was no fish special since it was Friday. The haddock had good flavor but was soggy. We were so hungry from the wait though that we didn't dare complain- maybe that's what they hope for. When we were leaving we asked to talk to the manager. She came up and was instantly on the defensive- again, not apologetic. She didn't own up to the bad service or problems they have in the kitchen and continued to FIGHT us on it. She was one of the rudest people I have ever dealt with, let alone a manager in the service industry whose job it is to smooth things over and make people happy. Needless to say we will never return."}
{"text":"Summer brunches at this restuarant can be really hit or miss.  Specifically, the outdoor seating can make brunch unbearable.  We went on a hot humid August morning, and our brunch was full of flies and mosquitoes.  The humidity wasn't any better.  The outdoor seating did allow an interesting view of boaters coming up the Yahara, parking, and eating.    As for the food, it was a pretty standard brunch, nothing special.  Lots of pastries and cakes, but nothing spectacular.  Also, hit this place once for a snack and got some gator-bites, which were deep fried alligator.  Nothing special, just real chewy deep fried meat."}
{"text":"We love this place as a local place to go. The nachos are awesome and the outside seating by the water is pretty cool.  Would be 5 stars if there were more craft beer selections  I'm an IPA fan so that makes my ratings tough if there aren't many IPAs on tap"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place for a Wisconsin Fish Fry. There are plenty of other places with better food, service and that are cleaner. Not the best restaurant in town that I've been to. A disappointment."}
{"text":"Stopped by to taste their Restaurant Week dinner.  I had the salmon, my friend had the steak and lobster.  Steak was a bit hard to chew and cut, but otherwise the food was great, staff was great, atmosphere was wonderful.  Looking forward to going back for a shrimp boil!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Fun friendly and fantastic views. Fish fry was hot crispy and delivered fast. Plus the beer was cold. Can't ask for more"}
{"text":"this is a cozy cavernous neighborhood bar.  A good \"go-to\" as far as I can tell.  Service was good and I got the strong sense I was surrounded by locals.  : )  We only had drinks, but it was just what we needed while we waited for our cocktail cruise to board."}
{"text":"Location is 4 stars...the food and drink 1 star. One of the only places on the water in Madison (technically Westport) the location is great in the summer BUT.....the only reason this place stays in business is because of the location and because they close during the winter with the exception of weekends. The food is not good and over priced, the mixed drinks are weak. It is only worth going to drink beer and wine because you  know what you are going to get. It is a real shame because the location is prime it just seems that they are relying on that and not the food or drinks"}
{"text":"Terrible Father's Day brunch. My bill totaled almost $90 for two people and it wasn't worth the money at all. The only thing decent was the omelet station. Don't waste your money here!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the fish Fry. Great fish. Fast and friendly service. Did not give a 5 star review because we order two apps and they were out of both."}
{"text":"Was at nautical tonight. My boyfriend and I come almost every week. If you are up for a fun time and great service come while Jessie is working. What a refreshing personality. He is so nice and is always happy to serve you. He is attentive and great to talk to.   We usually show up for cocktails, tonight we had nachos and they were delicious."}
{"text":"Asked for my steak medium and it came raw. The mushrooms tasted like they're cooked in dirt."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I thought Nau-Ti-Gal was just okay. We had been there before as substitutes for their volleyball league and stopped by the bar after for a few drinks.  The service at the bar was prompt for how busy they were, but not overly friendly. We went again for the fish fry, but we weren't very impressed. We went in the spring, and the decorations had a very Wintery theme to them still. It is an old supper club feel in the dining room. The food was just okay. We wouldn't go again unless we were meeting someone else who suggested to go there."}
{"text":"I hate to have to leave this poor review, but I must. We have been frequent patrons of the Nauti-Gal when we are in Madison for long weekends, and have always been treated just fine. Well, we returned this past weekend, just for drinks on Friday night and dinner on Saturday. They were \"busy\" from the sounds of the employees. Yes there was a crowd there, but I have worked for a facility where fewer employees have handled a crowd much larger. Also, they should train their employees not to blame slow service on other staff. I heard, from three different members of the wait staff, \"I am sorry for the wait, the kitchen is so slow.\" Or, from our particular waiter, \"geez, 45 minutes later. Sorry.\" Our meal was actually delicious, drinks were great, and I highly recommend the pub chips...the tangy sauce is to die for.   When it came time to pay, our waiter (a fairly newer employee, tall, thin and darker skin, working the outside bar) dropped our check off and said he would be right back. A good 15-20 passed and nothing. My husband became irritated and went up to the bar with the check to pay, since we obviously weren't getting anywhere by waiting.  The other bartender (shorter gentleman, with a buzzed or bald head) stated \"oh you wanna pay? You have to wait for your waiter.\"  He completely turned us away. So as my husband walks back over to me, he says \"I'll just take it inside.\" As he attempted to go up the stairs, that bald gentleman said \"here I'll take it.\"  As he was waiting, our actual waiter came back behind the bar and the other bartender said \"hey, did you have this gentleman?\" He responded \"no.\" The bald one says \"oh well thy had this....and this....\" His reply, \"nope not me.\" Without even looking at us! So very rude!!  Completely different service than what we had Friday night, at the inside bar! They were polite, not over friendly or social, but very efficient!! We didn't have to wait on drinks, they were ready when we were!  Sad to say, not sure we will be returning when we come back in a few weeks. It's a shame, but it seems like the service is slipping. My recommendation to you, maybe not have so many \"newer\" employees on the same shift, on a busy Saturday evening. It was so obvious that they were way too overwhelmed."}
{"text":"first, the room where we were seated smelled like a bathroom - a urine-type smell.  My daughter and I thought this, which was confirmed to be a bathroom smell after a trip to the bathroom.  there were a number of air fresheners sitting in corners in the room in which we were eating - which is rather disgusting.  The food was not good.  Had the onion burger - advertised as a burger with caramelized onions and onion straws on it - totally flavorless (how can onions be flavorless?  they were)  no seasoning on burger - simply no flavor.  The nachos had blue and red chips a color of which no food should ever be - bright almost neon blue and bright pink-red - seriously?  We ordered chicken nachos and envisioned shredded seasoned chicken - nope.  small diced flavorless chicken.    simply disappointing.  would not return."}
{"text":"I had a gift certificate for one free brunch so I went there with my mother (who happens to live across the street) one recent Sunday morning. There were very few people in the restaurant, probably because it was the Sunday after Thanksgiving. We were seated right away but it took a while for a server to come to our table. It really wasn't a big deal since it's a self-serve buffet after all, but we flagged down the manager because we had a question.   Although the brunch is quite extensive, it is rather pricey at $16. Since my mother is a little older now, she doesn't eat a lot so we politely asked if she could just have a muffin or something small from the buffet and pay a reduced price instead of being charged for a full brunch. This manager (I didn't get her name) picked up the gift certificate and seemed perturbed by the very question! We heard an inaudible remark as she read it over, making it blatantly obvious she DID NOT want to accommodate this simple request. She reluctantly gave in and then walked away as if she was pissed that she agreed to it.   Whatever her name, this so-called manager definitely does NOT belong in hospitality, much less in charge of a popular water-front restaurant! She only smiles when you are greeted, but otherwise has a general rough, hardened look to her. As I ate my meal, she made it a point to check our table to make sure my mother wasn't getting more that just a muffin as agreed-- (oh no!!) On top of that, they TAXED my FREE gift certificate! What a lousy way to treat your customers and such stingy business practices!"}
{"text":"That was a really frustrating experience. We've been here a couple times by boat because the location is great. I'm pretty sure our server was incompetent. There was a wait for service, a wait for food but apparently plates are in short supply because the server was clearing the table while we were still eating.  That makes me nuts because it's rude.   One of the meals was prepared incorrectly and had to be remade and it took forever.  Sure they were a little busy when we got there but it was a ghost town by the time we escaped.    The incorrect meal was not comped as I would have done had it been my call. That was weird. I'd suggest eating somewhere else but I wish it was better."}
{"text":"The Nau-Ti-Gal continues to get my business because of its convenient location for those of us on the north side of Madison, its lakefront setting, and a good Sunday brunch.  Other than the brunch, the place is average.  The food is generally fine, but nothing to write home about, and the service is often subpar.  Waitstaff is often slow, inattentive, and ill-informed.  I have had some good times there, but it is wise to go in with low expectations."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch. Edible items include bacon and funnel cake strips. Everything else appeared to have been purchased frozen from Sam's club."}
{"text":"5 stars for the supurb service! Robert is a class act and an excellent example of how to run a restaurant through quality, top notch service. The location is exceptional for a summer dinner in Wisconsin. Nau-Ti-Gal is a Madison Must. We have been coming here a long time and it is the perfect outdoor dining establishment with an adorable nautical theme. Madison original, Madison staple, Madison classic. They are great at what they do and it is always a pleasure to dine at the Nau-Ti-Gal."}
{"text":"Great location and nice staff. Regular food is pretty good, but their brunch is awesome!! Make sure to save room for the cookie dough!!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times. The first time everything was great. The next time the food was good but the service was bad. Now the food is medicore and the service is terrible. I'm not sure who is running the kitchen but they need to get someone else. The table next to us left because they were waiting so long for their food. We waited 45 minutes for 2 salads, a caprese sandwich, and fish with mash potatoes. The party of 6 that was seated after us got their food before us as well. It wasn't even that busy either which was the really perplexing part of why the wait was so long. We're done giving this place any more chances."}
{"text":"This joint earns an extra star from me because I could bring the dog.  Food was okay.  The baby walleye sandwich was dominated by the bread and I lost the taste of the fish.  Cheese curds were very good but really, how can you screw up deep fried cheese?  Not memorable and I sort of wished that I had waited to eat at the Madison Mallards baseball game."}
{"text":"Great bartenders,  excellent gimlets, laid back atmosphere and good food! I recommend the cheese curds and the broiled fish sandwich."}
{"text":"A lovely spot in the summer with sub-par service.  My husband and I have been to the Nau-Ti-Gal numerous times.  We love the clam chowder (also available at Captain Bill's and Mariners Inn).  Though the chowder did hit the spot tonight, the service certainly didn't.  First, we followed the rules and went in to ask for a table outside - the hostess went to check if the table where she was going to seat us was ready, but came back and said that someone just walked up and sat at the table she was going to put us and there would be a 20-30 min wait.  Um, why don't you politely say to the people who sat at the table designated for us to move or wait, but they won't do that as it may offend the customers (um, we're customers!).  So we went outside and low and behold we see an available table so asked a near by waitress if we can sit there and she said sure - no wait needed.  For dinner we ordered the chowder and since they don't serve any rolls with it we ordered some pretzels and specified to the waiter these were to go with the soups.  I also ordered a fish sandwich and since you can request it in a wrap I asked for that.  Instead of getting the soup first we got the soft pretzels and the sandwich and with a bun not in a wrap.  After asking about the soups...they did arrive a short while later but after my corrected wrap sandwich.  There were other little things with the service.  And, though the food is good, the place seems to be staffed with high school kids with very poor training.  We'll likely be back, but probably not until fall."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Sunday night for an early dinner. They seemed disorganized in trying to determine if our group could be seated outside, as at least three different employees asked if we had been helped yet. We did get a table outside. Very cheap plastic chairs outdoors. The wait staff all appeared quite young and inexperienced. Our waitress appeared to be tearful after dealing with another frustrated table who were also dissatisfied but not being very polite. They were out of their primary dinner shrimp entree. Waitress forgot my drink order. The beer selection is sub-par. The pretzel appetizer was still cold. The food took a very long time - 45 + minutes for some pretty basic menu items. The food was okay, but something I would expect more at a dive bar. The wrong items were split in the check - we just didn't bother and paid it. We felt really bad for the waitress, as this place is a hot mess. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Madison's boating and yachting community know this as a traditional old spot on the north shore of Lake Mendota east of Waunakee.  Good fish fry and interesting decor."}
{"text":"The waitress was great. The baby Walleye Dinner is $16.99 and it looks like an appetizer, it had like 6 tiny pieces of fish possibly smaller than chicken nuggets at McDonald's..the garlic mash potatoes were delicious but about 4 bites. Their problem is mainly serving size for what you are paying.  Same with the Cubano sandwich..delicious but tiny for what you are paying.  Oh and the two guys that they had for live music were horrible...and we weren't the only ones that thought so..we couldn't eat fast enough to get out of there."}
{"text":"Went for the Sunday brunch.  Wide assortment of items but quality lacking.  Bacon and prime rib overcooked.  Many items seemed to be out of the box and not home made.  We questioned if it was clam chowder or sausage gravy.  Don't ask what's in the eggs continental.    Eggs Benedict were decent."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant 0 stars I would. This was the worst experience I've ever had eating a meal, the food was terrible (ex: the lemon bars tasted like someone put dish soap in them), the waiters/waitresses were rude and talked bad about customers. Steer clear of this place!!"}
{"text":"Horrible.  This place is an awesome location - right up near the docks and water.  They also seem to have a popular bar.  The positives end there.  The food was horrible - everything was either frozen-then-fried or microwaved.  We ordered an app, salad and entree - all of which came at once, and all of which should never have been served.  It felt like our waiter was very new to the job, so I understand that he might have been having a rough night... but he was probably aslo lucky he did not ask how our food was.  I rarely am honest when its bad, but we were both eager to explain why neither of us ate any of the food that was served.  We wasted 50 dollars - don't make our mistake, we definitely won't make that mistake again.  On a side note - I'm not sure what is going on with Yelp, but I've noticed that many negative reviews for this restaurant are being \"filtered\"... is Yelp really that low?  If a restaurant pays them enough do they filter the review? What is going on??"}
{"text":"So Saturday, February 17th, I stopped by with my son and nephew for lunch. As we were walking up to the door, someone locked the door. We could hear laughter coming from inside. Can someone please explain how in 2018 discrimination is still a thing. Yes my son and nephew are minority's. Needless to say I will not ever come back to this establishment!!!"}
{"text":"It's a bit out of my way than I would have liked, but that's something I can deal with.  The location is pretty nice, but watch out for outside seating + summer days. That's going to lead to a loooooooot of mosquito bites.   Anyways, came here with a bunch of people for restaurant week, and got their 3-course meal deal.  I got their clam chowder, surf & turf and brownie sundae.  The clam chowder was very rich and creamy, with a ton of flavor. Definitely my favorite dish.  The surf & turf was pretty good, though the waitress messed up our orders, and I ended up with medium well instead of medium rare. The steak was tough, but it was very tasty. The lobster was well seasoned and juicy, but the butter was a bit too oily for me. I also really enjoyed the garlic mashed potatoes that came on the side.  I didn't try too much of the sundae, since I was extremely full by the time it came to dessert, but from the few bites I've had; it was extremely rich and sweet.  It was probably a bit too heavy for a dessert option, but oh well.  The food was good and the location was ok, so why the 3 stars? Well, our service wasn't the greatest. I realize our waitress was new, but that's no excuse for messed orders and delayed service. One of my friends didn't get her drink until 20 minutes later.   Buuut seeing as I'm a nice person, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and come back next time for a redemption meal :)"}
{"text":"Management 101: Because you can never predict how anyone will react to being terminated, you opt for an after shift \"brief meeting\", if it couldn't have happened beforehand. A termination is never a pleasant ordeal for either party but surely common sense should have prevailed and clearly it didn't. Anyone who would have been dismissed in this fashion would in all likelihood have reacted badly. You as an owner have to OWN this misstep.   I do appreciate the effort, Jack. But does it matter? I'm sure you can afford to lose a customer here and there. My husband and I wish the establishment well but we will not be back.   Nautigal needs to clean up its act or close its doors."}
{"text":"We have not been to Nau-ti-gal in many years and I had a Friday evening flight so we wanted something close by. We assumed it would be packed on a Friday night, so I called to see how long the wait would be. It should have been a red flag when the woman on the phone said no wait......I had the nachos and added chicken, or so they called it chicken on the menu.... it was not chicken! My husband went with the fish fry. Their over fried cod what the special on a Friday night. The highlight of the meal was the french fries! Our server was nice as we continued to comment about the lack of ranch dressing which was requested, the return of an old fashion drink that was made incorrectly..... likely will not be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"This is near our house, so we like to pop in. The outdoor seating is great in summer, and the tropical menu is fun on a cold, winter day.  Food is okay. Nothing I particularly crave between visits, but it is nicer than most waterfront joints where you can park a boat.   I do enjoy the house salad. Strangely, it comes with a little side cup of chocolate chip cookie dough. I don't know why they include this, especially since cookie dough contains raw egg (I'm surprised there isn't some code they are violating), but I happen to love chocolate chip cookie dough and I can't wait to eat it with my salad.  I tried something different tonight: curry chickpea and lentil stew. It was pretty good! I can't stand cilantro and was able to order the entree without it.  My husband had a massive cheeseburger, which he loved. I can attest the fries were great as well. They leave some skin on and use a lot of salt. Yum.  Now for the reasons this is a two star review instead of higher:  The outdoor seating process is a complete cluster. If you enter the front door at the hostess stand and ask for an outside table, they tell you to go outside to be seated. OK, no problem. We'll go outside.  Outside, we were told all tables were full and to go INSIDE to get a pager from the hostess. We saw open tables near the outdoor bar and asked if we could eat at those tables. The waitress said those were first come, first serve, and we could eat dinner there. She was very friendly about it, \"Yes, they'll give you menus there and take care of you, but you just have to order from the bartender because there is no table service.\"  We were good with that and grabbed a table. I went to the bar for menus and I was told we could only order appetizers in the bar section. I explained the waitress had just told us we could order off the full menu. Bartender's response: \"Oh, was that the one in the orange shirt?\" Me: \"No, it was someone in a blue shirt.\" I'm not sure why that mattered but should not have been the response.   Bartender says we have to go inside for a pager to get a table. By this time more customers are ahead of us in line. On a Saturday night, every place we'd visit with patio seating would be busy, so we decided to get a pager and wait.  I get a pager from the inside hostess stand. I will skip writing about the conversation between the hostess and the waitresses since this review is getting long. However, I will note the person who had just told me we could order off the full menu at the outdoor bar was there and I told her we had just learned we had to get a regular table to order from the full menu. Her reply, \"Oh, sorry, I forgot.\"  We then go back to the outside bar to wait for the pager to buzz.  Surprisingly, it only took about 10 minutes for a table to become available. I go back to the outdoor hostess stand, walking by one of the three open tables we'll be seated at, and the waitress tells me I have to take my pager back inside before she will seat me. I just about lost my mind at this point!!! I keep my head cool and level, despite my frustration. I walk BACK into and through the restaurant to drop off the pager. The hostess says thanks and tells me to go back outside and find a waitress to seat us.   Restaurant Manager: if you read this review, please fix this process! All the burden of finding a table is on your customers. Hire a real hostess for outside and either give her a stack of pagers or have her commit to memory who is on the wait list. I cannot believe how disorganized this was. The Nau-ti-Gal owners have owned restaurants in Madison for decades. This is rookie performance."}
{"text":"Had an incredible bowl of Clam Chowder -- holy crap it was good! They didn't cut any corners on this soup as it was rich as Donald Trump. I also had the Prime Rib -- which I've only once enjoyed out of the dozen times I've ordered it anywhere (I might as well stop ordering it) -- and it was nothing to crow about. A huge piece of meat made medium rare with minimal flavor and a large quantity of fat. However, the clam chowder was INCREDIBLE! WOW! Structurally, a great rectangular bar with cute nude brass mermaids set in it. Also, a nice salt water fish tank on display.  Interestingly, the salads came with a small container of cookie dough. I don't get the gimmick, but my wife liked it."}
{"text":"Came for the outdoor seating. Millions of mosquitoes. Did not stay for drinks as everyone was packing up outside even though it was beautiful out. Restaurant smelled dirty. This place needs a massive renovation if they want to stay in business. It seems the family concentrates on the mariner and the nautigal is left behind with no effort. Menu hasn't changed and the place seems dirty."}
{"text":"I very rarely ever use the words \"awful,\" \"horrible\" or \"terrible\" to describe food, but those words are appropriate for my review of Nau-ti-Gal.  My calamari: Nau-ti-Gal's calamari is out of a frozen bag. I've eaten both freshly prepared calamari and frozen bag calamari, and it's quite easy to tell the difference.  My basa wrap: it consisted of little pieces of flaky, bland fish pressed together, lots of bitter-tasting lettuce leaves, a tomato slice, and a tortilla. No sauce. I felt as though my fish was put together from scraps of fish; it was not a solid slice/piece. I don't know how old the lettuce was, but it did not taste fresh.   My coleslaw was very bad: not only was it bland, but it tasted rancid like the mayo was expired. I only ate one bite and knew I couldn't eat any more.   I ate my entire dinner at Nau-ti-Gal in about six bites, which included just half the wrap and the one bite of coleslaw. I ate a bowl of cereal when I got home.  Meals I've had before at Taco Bell and Burger King have been tastier, fresher and better-prepared than what I ate at Nau-ti-Gal. From my experience there, I don't have the impression that Nau-ti-Gal cares about the quality, freshness or presentation of its food."}
{"text":"Best brunch in town, hands down. You have to get the bottomless mimosas cuz if you get three, it covers the cost. $10, heck yeah!"}
{"text":"We visited Nau-Ti-Gal on UW Madison graduation day as a celebration. We called ahead earlier in the week to confirm our party of roughly 12. They said no problem. We show up around noon? Sunday brunch is still going on, okay no worries.... Well they were closing after brunch so no lunch/dinner menu. We explained we intended on eating lunch. The waitress told us she would have to ask the cooks if this would be okay since they were going to close. She came back and told us that they said they could serve us. So we all ordered different entrees. I had a pasta, I can't remember the name for the life of me. It was pretty good, service was standard. I imagine this place is hopping in the summer considering it's location. I would go back."}
{"text":"We have waited about two years to return to this underwhelming place. Maybe it's better now? Well it's not. Yes the view and the service are still good but the food and other annoying things are still there. We sat at the outside bar with a very good bartender that appears to have three jobs, bartender, greeter and food server, while others are standing around doing nothing. After having a cocktail we asked if we could be seated, but was told that we had to go inside, walk the entire length of the bar to ask a hostess if they had a table outside. They didn't know if a table was open and acted confused as if that was an usual request. They (two young ladies) said they would check and find us at the bar. Why are they not outside to begin with with since thats where everyone is on a nice spring evening? Next,  the misleading menu. It's lists Besa, a \"fish that tastes just like Grouper\".  I looked it up and Besa is an imported catfish from the Mekong river in Vietnam. Hardly Grouper quality. Then there was the, \"baby Walleye\" which our server said was just Perch not a Walleye at all. OK. I finally ordered the fish fry, and it was three pieces of fish in a heavy batter that looked just like small corn dogs. I opened the batter and removed the Cod pieces and it was very good. At the end of the meal I had a fair sized pile of fried batter on the plate. Not the kind of thing most people eat anymore.  The coleslaw was very coarse cut and uninspired. Fries were very good. My wife had the small fried  shrimp called \"firecracker shrimp\" which were in a thick batter as well but were actually good tasting. Of course the menu said \"lightly battered\" but it wasn't. At the bottom of the menu it said \"table water and bread and butter would not be served unless asked for. Our way of being green\" This was sort of a contradiction sense all of the plates and utensils  are plastic throwaways!  Last, as were were winding down this beautiful evening we noticed the server cleaning the two empty tables across from us. She was using a cocktail napkin after dipping the corner in a water glass and then scrubbing the visible smears  left on the tables!  No disinfectant and a cleaning rag here! Really? What a mismanaged disappointment  this restaurant is. It could be so much better.  Year after year we wonder why people come back here to eat. A cocktail on the deck yes, food no. They keep in business because of he location. They wouldn't make it anywhere else.  Maybe we will come back in two more years. Naw, probably not."}
{"text":"It's a nice motorcycle ride, and a nice setting, but that's about all that I can say that's positive. We got there at about 7:30, there were very few customers and I saw at least four staff.  In spite of that it took our waiter nearly fifteen minutes to come to our table.  When he showed up he told us he'd been \"preoccupied\". He took our orders, forgot about my beer, and we didn't see him again until well after the food arrived.  I had to flag down a different server to get more tarter sauce for my overcooked breaded walleye. We asked him to split the bill down the middle.  He failed to divide 44 in half accurately. The food was nothing special, the service was bad, but it's a nice view of the water."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! This was without question the worst meal that I have had at a restaurant. I can see going there for a drink as it has a pretty outdoor area, however the food is GARBAGE. We ordered the \"customers favorite\" Baby Walleye fish and iit was almost entirely breading with a little bit of tough and clearly frozen fish.  The service was also terrible.  We ordered salads, appatizers and entres and all were brought out at the same time. The waiter had to be reminded that a salad came with the dinner. When the meal ended, I had hardly eaten any of the food on my plate and not only did the waiter never ask if everything was okay, he didn't offer a doggy bag or ask if something was wrong with the food.  Dinner for 2 was over $50 despite the fact that I could buy better fish in the frozen children's food section of a grocery store.  DO NOT EAT HERE...IT WAS AWFUL!"}
{"text":"I can't say whether this place is convenient or not, only that it took a while from the hotel which really depends on where your hotel is. They say it's by the water, but I feel it's not close enough to the water as I can barely see it. There appears to be a bike trail nearby as I saw lots of bicyclists grab a drink here, the patio seems nice to grab a drink at.  I hear this place has quite the history and they have a few restaurants in the area. The vibe inside is very dark and very different tan the outside, which still feels old but at least it's outside.  The coconut shrimp is large, but tasted a little undercooked. The chowder which I was told is heart comes in this cup that looks quite nice and it is hearty indeed. A little bit thick but it has good amount of seafood in it. And when the food came out, there were pieces of it missing like sauces, salad in one case, fries in another. You really gotta come out at once, especially when it's the sauce advertised that it comes with!  They have a good amount of beer on tap, and plenty of craft selection. I really liked their selection, seems well thought out with a good mixture of different kins.  The service, they were nice but there are few points missing.  They took almost 30 minutes before our drink order was taken. We had to go get our own menus. They seemed severely understaffed and could use a bit more education on the items.  I know you have history, but I think they gotta get their act in gear."}
{"text":"Just walked in the bar at 9:40 pm, with 2 Bartenders and 7 people drinking, and was told they are closed before I made it through the door. They yelled it at me. With 9 other people in the room.  This is consistently the worst bar I've been to in Madison, and unfortunately the closest bar to my house. Every three months I hope it gets better, but it just keeps sucking. PS: Really bad food every time."}
{"text":"Hmm, well let's just say, if there was a zero, I would give them a zero. I was really excited to try this place because I have heard such good things about their food.  First, it is a generously set buffet. However, half of the food looks inedible. The ala carte area seemed like something you can not mess up. Bacon, sausage, turkey, mashed potatoes and eggs continental. I have NO idea what eggs continental means. There were no scrambled eggs but this off casserole of egg. It was weird and I have no idea what was in it. There was no description. The bacon was greasy and the sausages tasted old. The weird part? The turkey was all shaped the same. It looked like they were processed pieces of meat. The omelette bar was nice. It was your usual sort. The clam chowder looked old. VERY grey. I did not even attempt. The breakfast potatoes were old, cold and over seasoned.  The salad bar was STRANGE. There was not a single simple salad. Everything was a unique salad type. While I commend their creativity, sometimes it is nice to have a plain greens salad. The highlight is the dessert bar. There is cake, bars and a make your ice cream station."}
{"text":"The fish is only ok. We went on a Sunday during brunch hours and the brunch looked ok, but it was far to expensive for what you appeared to get. The restaurant has a nice view, especially if you haven't been on this side of the lake."}
{"text":"To start... we had to search for someone to seat us and when we did find someone they looked at us and walked away without saying a word. We ordered a bloody and it contained zero garnishes, simply mix and vodka. We waited 50 minutes for our food and the seating was barely over 50% full which is completely unacceptable. Meanwhile, an angry customer in a group sitting behind us slammed the table out of frustration because of very slow service.  Another table next to us became frustrated when almost all their orders were messed up.  It was obvious that leadership was not present and cutting corners is commonplace. I ordered the classic club wrap and the lettuce was discolored and soggy. My boyfriend ordered the baby walleye sandwich and the fillets were dry. Save yourself the grief and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nau-Ti-Gal is close to home.  This is our second visit in as many months.  Both visits, the food has been delicious.  Hospitality has been gracious.  Tonight Bobby was our server, he did a nice job but seemed a little overwhelmed with the number of tables he had. I had the Wisconsin fish fry - I love that Nautigal serves this Wisconsin famous, fish fry dinner all the time not just on Friday nights. Our table dined on shark bites for appetizers - always excellent; house salad with a bowl of the famous Captain Bill's Chowder (always excellent), Baby Walleye sandwich, and coconut shrimp - all were delicious and equally enjoyed.  The ladies tried Long Island Iced teas and a Key Lime Martini - an Old Fashioned and tap beers were also served - sorry to say, the cocktails were misses - almost like the bartender was mixing by reading a recipe...this was a Saturday evening and they were not real busy.  Not sure, maybe an \"off\" night at the bar.  None-the-less we enjoyed our visit, as we always enjoy the Von Ruetenberg's establishments.  Nautigal is probably more fun in the summer as they are located on the Yahara River and mouth of Lake Mendota - but they serve great food all year round.  Give them a visit, I'd like to hear what you think."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week. The decor is very casual with plastic chair settings outside. The first course was fine (clam chowder and summer salad) nothing especially memorable with it. The second course, I had the lobster stuff salmon and it was very delicious. Salmon was cooked well and a good portion of lobster was provided! Dessert was just ok too. Most memorable part of the meal was the entree. Service was fine, some of the student employees could use some more training."}
{"text":"It wasn't very long ago that I was singing the praises of Nau-Ti-Gal to my friends and family. Here was a wonderful brunch buffet that was so close to home that it was absurd that we hadn't even known of it until three years after moving to the neighborhood. Within a course of 5 or so months, we returned 4 times. Today will probably be our last day attending this restaurant.  The very first fork full that my girlfriend pulled from her plate had a wad of hair in it. I'm not talking about one long strand that was bunched up upon itself, this looked like what a fifth grade girl would pull off of her hair tie after a long day of having her hair in a ponytail. It was almost comically hanging there off the end of my girlfriend's fork, like some sort of disgusting practical joke. This was a wad of long dark black hair. My girlfriend has vibrant purple hair and my hair is short. This was obviously not from us.   Being a buffet, you might want to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt, after all, another patron might be responsible. Here's the thing about that; the entrée that my girlfriend was about to eat was of a smoked salmon that had just freshly been brought out of the kitchen as we were perusing the buffet line. I was the first customer that even touched it. My girlfriend was the second.   Her meal was comped, but she was too nauseous and upset to eat anything more, after only just sitting down to her first bite. The waitress, for her part, was accommodating and apologetic, if a little too chipper for the situation, but I tried my best not to direct any outrage her way. I am well aware that she isn't personally responsible. But she then confided in what I would assume was the owner or operator, an older severe looking woman with heavy makeup and shorter straw like hair, who then took it upon herself to come to our table to discuss the conflict.   The situation devolved even further from there. This woman at first was apologetic, but quickly became defensive and confrontational, incredulously asking my tearful girlfriend if she would rather her personally fry up something off menu. Her tone became harsh, and I reacted with the same, telling her that this experience has very likely ruined our day. She shot back that it's not like this thing happens all the time,  and that if it did, nobody would return. To this my girlfriend replied that it did in fact happen today, and we very well likely will not return because of it. At this point, this severe, murky woman dismissed us, walked away while snorting a contrite \"sorry\" over her shoulder, all while telegraphing that she was anything but sorry, and that we were just two rubes that stopped being important the second our bill was settled. This angered me more than anything.   I left without tipping that waitress and I regret doing that, but there was no way I was going to pay any more for this terrible experience than I already had to. If that waitress reads this review, I want you to know that I had every intention of leaving you a 15% tip until your rude, overbearing, tacky boss opened her mouth.  I only write negative reviews when I feel like I am justified. I encourage anybody who is looking to dine at this restaurant to dine elsewhere, where your patronage is appreciated and valued.  *UPDATE* The very next day I was contacted via yelp email by a member of Nau-Ti-Gal's management, and the tone was much more apologetic. She offered us a gift certificate for reimbursement and promised that the entire staff was alerted to our experience, and that certain \"drastic changes\" were going to be made. This was the reaction I would have expected yesterday for somebody trying to sooth angry customers, not the exacerbating reaction we did get.   We accepted their apology and their gift certificate, although I made it clear that we would not redeem it until long after whatever \"changes\" have already been made. My girlfriend is having a much harder time forgiving and forgetting, so we will wait until she's able to stomach the idea of returning.   But this gesture from the Nau-Ti-Gal management is why I've changed my star rating from a one (really a zero) to a two, because it doesn't change the fact that this situation happened, but it at least makes me feel better about it."}
{"text":"The outdoor seating for this place is really cool. The chairs are a little uncomfortable. The food was about average. I had the Voodoo burger. It had some heat to it but lacked any real flavor. There were 4 of us there and 2 of us ordered the same drink 3 different times while we were there and the bartender made 3 completely different drinks each time. The first time it was yellow, second was red, third was pink. I think the bartender was new and really had no idea what was going on by our dealings with each other. He really had no hospitality skills....or bar tending skills. The drinks were tasty, I'm just not sure which drink I will get when I order it ever again.  Also they were a little pricy for being served in a clear plastic solo cup.   The person that appeared to be the owner or manager was very nice and seated us in the cocktail area for dinner. They had quite a few full tables when we got there so the service was a little slow. But when most of the tables left the service really didn't speed up and nobody bussed the empty tables.  They sat there dirty for about an hr with no one even attempting to clean them or get the dishes. Very weird. It's a cool place because you can come in your boat and dock it and have dinner or drinks. I would go back. I hope their appropriately staffed and have a much better bartender."}
{"text":"Poor service, the server was new and untrained.  could not tell a medium rare from a well done steak. Then he blamed me because i did not communicate my problem correctly. If you go there ask for any server but JOJO"}
{"text":"Nauti-gal needs to get back to basics. Thoroughly clean the restaurant and focus on fresh, consistent, good quality food. The food is currently pretty nasty and not fresh at all. The atmosphere is pretty grungy, and the wait staff is surly. Not worth it. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We had an unfortunate experience at the Nautigal last week but after sending an email, the owner was very responsive and was apologetic, explained how the errors occurred and completely redeemed the situation.  With all the chains, fast food around these local folks will continue to have our business!  It's a class act."}
{"text":"Great location, very dated, friendly slow staff, awful food!  All frozen or canned food here. Wife ordered a walleye sandwich...fish fillet from McDs is better. I ordered the seafood wrap with crab meat...how about no all inside was tuna and acidic watery mayo. Stay away....you've been warned!"}
{"text":"Expensive food considering the poor quality. Went here for restaurant week and wasn't too keen on their menu for the special occasion and order off the regular menu. I settled for their (I believe) orange popcorn shrimp as an app. For $9, all I got was salty and overly drenched with sauce a small specs of shrimp. Absolutely NOT worth $9. They need to rethink their $$$ on this or fix the recipe.   For my entree, I order the crispy chicken sandwich. My sandwich was dry and nearly overcooked. At least it was thoroughly cooked considering I burned the roof of my mouth once I bit into it. The kicker for me was their being an upcharge for fries... Pathetic. Any place that charges you extra $ for subbing fries instead of something like coleslaw is not for me. What a rip off.  My boyfriend did order from the Restaurant Week menu. He had the surf and turf being lobster tail and a steak. The TINIEST steak and lobster tail I've ever seen. Considering it cost $30, you better cook to impress.   This place is a total rip off. You'd be better going to Red Lobster for seafood.  Also, fix up the place. The decor is awful!"}
{"text":"Let's cut to the chase: food, drink, environment, band, and volleyball  I loved my chicken stuffed seafood with hollandaise. Seafood salad was good but wasn't anything to write home about. There was a salmon salad someone ordered at the table, but it didn't come with a dressing and really could have used more flavor.   The blueberry lemonade, which was $4, was a favorite of my friends. I tend not to like those flavors, but after three beers I enjoyed the contrast.   The environment is worth the trip outside Madison. If you live on the water you can ride up on a boat. They have piers for guests.   The band was really good for a Thursday.   They have a sand volleyball court, so perhaps they have competitive leagues."}
{"text":"Eek!  Methinks not indeed.  I'm not one to throw out one star reviews lightly, but my recent dining experience at Nau-Ti-Gal really left me with no choice.  It was the perfect storm of lackadaisical service, cheesy decor and a complete and utter lack of want by the kitchen.  As I was dieting at the time, I decide to go with the seafood salad, since the restaurant has a nautical theme and the menu exclaimed the dish as the \"Best seafood salad around!\".  A simple dish for a restaurant that proclaims the use of \"fresh and local ingredients\" on their website.  What I received was a sad plate of wilted iceberg lettuce with a couple cherry tomatoes and some chunks of hard-boiled eggs tossed in.  The seafood component of the meal was just as craptastic, an overdressed mix of tiny, canned shrimp and canned crab meat that the family cat won't touch.  Just an utter fail from a kitchen that apparently takes no pride in what it serves.  The only positive I can come up with is that I didn't wreck my diet that night as I barely touched my meal.  My wife suffered a similar fate with her chicken salad.  It had the same sorry looking greens topped with bland, overcooked strips of chicken breast meat.  Again a simple dish that can be great with fresh, well prepared ingredients, but the kitchen failed to deliver.  Service was sporadic for our group of 20 on a slow Thursday night at the restaurant.  Wait times were long for both our drinks and food.   Our server wasn't real helpful when looking for entree recommendations and I was disappointed that our server never checked in to see how our meals were.  Our group as able to get separate checks, so there's a small positive.  Cost for this forgettable experience was $35 for two salads, drinks and a mandatory tip.  The waterfront location makes this restaurant a potential gem.  It's too bad the owners have failed to capitalize on that potential."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks like a converted lakefront house, which offers a fantastic view of the docks in the area (it would have been awesome if it wasn't pouring during half of our meal). Our group of eight sat in the outdoor seating area under the awning, and was able to enjoy the warm weather and the view until the sun set (and the mosquitos started attacking).  As part of the Restaurant Week deal, I ordered the clam chowder, the surf and turf, and the rocky road brownie sundae.   The clam chowder was super rich and chock full of clams, but it was a little tooooo thick for my liking. Definitely felt a little like drinking gravy - as someone mentioned below. Still, I thought it was super cute that they served the chowder in a mug. Classic!  As for the steak, I ordered it medium well, which got a few weird stares from my dining companions, but I like my meat cooked! The steak did end up being a little too tough and hard to chew, but at least it wasn't bleeding all over the place. Definitely nothing spectacular about the steak here though - I'd suggest ordering some sort of seafood instead. The lobster tail was phenomenal, and totally made up for the mediocrity of the steak. It was well-seasoned and tasted fresh, which, given the restaurant's location in the Midwest, was a nice surprise.  The sundae was served super melted, which made it a lot less appetizing...It was also a little too heavy and too sweet to end the meal with. I ate a portion of the brownie, salvaged what I could of the ice cream, and sat back and waited for the check.  Service was suuperrr slow and I don't think it was because it was only our waitress' first day on the job. The other servers didn't seem particularly accommodating either, and spent a lot of their time joking and messing around with each other. Our waitress gave us each $10 coupons at the end of our meal that we could use another time. I don't know if it was some sort of promotion that they were offering everyone or if it was her way of apologizing for the lackadaisical service. Who knows.  For the $25 price tag, the starter/entree/dessert Restaurant Week combo was a great way to sample the menu. Now that I have though, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Was grossed out on Sunday brunch. I think the food is horribly average. Nice to boat to for drinks"}
{"text":"Had one experience at this joint. It was a good ol' time. Ate some shark bites, drank a lot of beer and had a lot of shots. Walked back to my friends place near by and crashed on the couch. Bar tender service was great, really welcoming bar scene."}
{"text":"I dont understand the low ratings for this place! Service is prompt and pleasant. The food was really good. I mean....my expectations were exceeded. Here is a play by play: First, I was feeling hot chocolate. I think its the pre snowmaggedon vibe here. It wasnt on the menu! Our server just smiled and said shed make it happen. It happened. It was good. Next a steamy mug of Clam Chowder. Nom nom nom nom. It was a meal in itself. Finally, being in a burger kick ee split the French Onion and Vodoo soicy something or other. Verdict? The french onion burger is better. The toppings are fresh. The bun isnt toasted...and needs to be. They were apparently uncomfortable with cooking it medrare because it was solid medium. Burgers solid. Not red robin, but good. Fries: meh Chips: not homemade. Dont bother.  Everything else was awesome, cozy and a great experience."}
{"text":"A star for service and the beautiful outside scenery. No stars for food...yuck. Also, I loved eating right on the Waters edge, but they should definitely consider investing in different chairs. I am 130 lbs and thought the plastic dollar store chair was going to break. Back to the food... Slimy salad greens and my salad was missing items which were to be included on it. Sent the salad back, got clam chowder which was good, but s-a-l-t-y. My boyfriend ate half of his burger, he loves burgers; Nau-Ti-Gal messed up a simple burger...yikes. The waiter was nice, prompt, and apologetic for our terrible food. Sorry but can't say we will be returning unless new owners come in and revamp this monstrosity."}
{"text":"OK, so it appears that now Jack Von Rutenburg is the latest of the Von Rutenburg family to manage this restaurant. This used to be a good place to eat, but as you can see from the last few years reviews on Yelp, it's hit rock bottom. Mr. Rutenburg and family, please sell this so that it can again be enjoyed by diners. This great location is being wasted. I've watched as several family members have attempted to manage this, but it just keeps sinking lower. Please let someone purchase this so it can again be an acceptable restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"I had one of those Madison Original's coupons for the Nau-Ti-Gal burning in my pocket so I went last night with my good friend.  This is the first time I have been there.  I was interested in the Happy Hour but I wanted to sit outside due to the beautiful summer afternoon.  Our super cute waiter Jack was uber polite and enthusiastic about his service.  I ordered a Spotted Cow while I waited for my pal to come.  Plastic Chairs, cutesy menus, and Nautical Themes cover the patio.  My friend and I both ordered the Fish Fry, W had the fries and I ordered mixed veggies.  W ordered the clam chowder too.  I got a taste of it and it is good.  I would get that on a colder day.  When the plates came out, I was shocked to see half of my dinner sized plate covered in veggies.  Green Beans, Broccoli, Summer Squash, Red Peppers!  Not the corn, peas, and carrots, I was think I was going to get.  I was so pleased and excited.  All the veggies were cooked so well.   I ate a good chunk of them but I had to eat some of my fish, too.  The batter was good on the white fish.  I ended up taking the left over veggies home with me because they were too good to leave behind.  The price was right and the service was good.  I cannot wait to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"Haven't been to the Nautigal in 5 years because we moved away to Chicago. While visiting friends in Madison, my husband and I decided to visit while we were back because we remembered it as being such a charming place ...   WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!! The place has really gone down hill. The smell of garbage filled the air as we made the walk from the parking lot to the restaurant. Once inside, it was no better. The bathrooms were dirty, the bar sticky, and I watched in abject horror as the bartender poured my wine order in a glass that was coated with a cloudy white film.   Because we thought how much worse could it get, we ordered food, where it went from worse to the worst. My husband ordered the Fish Fry. The batter wasn't thoroughly cooked and the entire thing became a mushy mess in short order. Me? I had the seafood salad. I'll leave it right there because just recalling my first bite gives me the dry heaves.   The service was okay and by okay, I mean not bad for a bunch of what appeared to be high school kids. I guess it's cheaper to hire people who have no experience?   I really wanted to like it, I really did but it's not the place I remember and I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"After my first review, the General Manager personally emailed me and wanted to know the specifics so they can improve. She also gave me cert for full amount of our dinner.  I was impressed. We went back yesterday, and was very happy with the service (they did not know who we were until we paid) and the food. I will continue to go there for food in the future. I highly recommend them for restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"We traveled up from MKE to fish and enjoy Lake Mendota for the day today. Got hungry and opened up handy ole Yelp to find somewhere to eat where we could dock our boat. I was rather disappointed in the lack of dockside dining and the only choice at the time seemed to be this place. Despite the reviews, we needed a drink and some food.   Easy enough access for our small boat to clear the bridge and a really nice dock to tie up to. The waiters were very kind in greeting us and letting us choose a place to sit on the patio. The ambience of this place is great! The chairs were a a bit cheap (plastic patio chairs) and my legs stuck to them. Anyhow, I ordered a Bloody Mary and the blackened cajun chicken sandwich and my husband ordered the walleye sandwich and a beer. The bloody was bloody awful!! I'm not sure what was in this thing but it was sour. I opted to drink my Miller Lite chaser instead. Our food arrived rather quickly and the presentation was good, except the tomato on my husbands sandwich - it was wilted and questionable. My sandwich was so f%#*g spicy I couldn't even taste anything else on it. Mind you, I eat spicy food on a regular but this was a little too much for me. I tore off the bun, and tried to eat just the chicken. I moved on to the pasta salad side - seriously? Who makes this stuff? Horrible. My husband tossed his sad tomato and took a bite of his walleye and could barely chew it. He then motioned for me to try the fish - I spit it in to my napkin. Worst. Walleye. Ever. He ended up loading it with tartar sauce, squeeze of lemon, and then was able to tolerate the fishyness. He then moved on to his coleslaw. It was no better than the pasta salad. He used my chipotle ranch sauce and salt  to mix in to it to try to give it some flavor.   We REALLY wanted to like this place. The bill arrived and it was hard to swallow the $40.   I'd suggest you pass until they step up the menu and serve quality food."}
