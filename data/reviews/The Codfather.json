{"text":"Sonny: What the hell is this? Clemenza: It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.  The Codfather does not sleep with the fishes, but rather eats them, as my bumpersticker proudly boasts. Chippy + Corner Shoppe. Jelly Babies and Full English. Ta. We were driving around Phoenix and confronted by a billboard that boasted the best cod and chips this side of East End. One does not expect that in Phoenix, but the Codfather does not disappoint. This is the stuff. Up the Codfather!"}
{"text":"Real, and I mean real English fish & chips that are fabulous. Nice casual environment. Next time I have to try the Shepard's pie."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Ignore anything less than 5 stars reviews!   I'm British and this place is authentic, the owners have done a great job recreating an English Pub/Chippie What more do you people expect, we're in the AZ!"}
{"text":"Used Resturant.com to try this place and it is the reason I stopped by. Had a $10 coupon, had to get regular items to total before we could use it on the special or alcohol, not a big deal as I understand they need to make money to stay in business. (unlike other people whining here)  It's in a strip mall, but inside its a nice place, love the ambiance. The food was outstanding. Garlic Onion Rings, melt in your mouth good. Also had the Calamari and Cod and Sea Bass. Enough food for a lunch repeat the next day. Yes, the food would kill you if you did it everyday, but for a treat it is great.  The authentic foods were cool. I'll probably be back the next time I get a craving. The Onion Rings were that good."}
{"text":"I can not believe I had never been here. I lived in England and miss the food from there. This place is authentic. They even have Haddock. We had calamari, Haddock, \"chips\", and chicken fingers. All was good and very crispy just like in the UK. They even have a mini grocery store with all your favorites. The service was great. Judy was very happy and helpful. The hostess was also great. Great for kids, there is a Lego table in the dinning side for them with three stations."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I have never been to the UK but I have had my fair share of Fish & Chips at several places.  Service was great, tried a couple beers and decided on the Speckled Hen on Nitro. Delicious brew(for a non-stout!) Went for a basic Fish & Chips(small) and a Beef & Kidney Pie!  Took a little time to come out which is fine because I know it was made to order. Fish was simple, but not over-breaded or over-fried. Chips were great! Little crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The Beef & Kidney pie was yummy!!! Perfectly flaky crust and great flavor. BE CAREFUL!!!! This thing is hot!!!!! Cut it in 1/2 and leave it alone for at least 5-7min they bring it to you right out of the oven!  They have a very nice looking menu with several seafood and meat and even curry options. Super local to me, a place I will definitely go back to! Friday/Saturday all you can eat Fish and Chips for $12.95 and Happy Hour  from 3p-6p with a nice discount on beers!"}
{"text":"I love the selection of the fishes. The mashed potato & cabbage side dish are also amazing.  However, we didn't get our appetizer till after we finish our dinner and our complimentary chips were stale, greasy, and soft. Very disappointing.  Not sure if I would go out of my way to give it another try, but might if I am around the area."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a long time.  I love fish and chips.  Finally did and my personal experience was not good.  I ordered the fish and chips and all I could taste was scorched oil.  The chips were very soggy.  The staff seemed nice so I may try it again because it seems like more people like it than not and this could have been an isolated case. But not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of traditional British food, but I absolutely love good fish and chips - and this place makes great fish and chips!!  The rest, can't really say. Again, the cod fish and chips are to die for!  Having said that, there's one odd thing: you get a typical paper cup of tartar sauce with the meal, but if you want more they charge extra!?!?  Strange deal - hence 4-stars."}
{"text":"I thought there was too much oil left on the fish.  I joking tell friends it's like getting a quart of oil with your dinner.  I've tried them a few times now and I just can't deal with all the oil.  I even talked to the manager.  I asked if the oil wasn't hot enough or what...  I didn't get a satisfactory answer.  I give up on this place.  Try Oscar's Pier 83 instead; it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place but unfortunately am writing this review from the comfort of my bathroom where I'm currently experiencing some gastrointestinal distress, sadly. Always a bad sign when you take your first bite and it tastes of old oil; then when the fish falls out of the fried batter casing also not a good sign. Had a sausage roll as well, seemed better off, had considerable sage flavor, and was a bit hot, spice-wise. Generally can't recommend."}
{"text":"This place was great! Our host was super nice and the restaurant was very clean. It's not very big, but the food was great. We ordered the Scotch egg to start, delicious. The cod and chips was great. We will definitely come back and recommend The Codfather."}
{"text":"Food is consistently great and they have a great selection of draught beers as well as a full bar. The desserts are wonderful. Full English breakfast served too. One of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Yuck!!!!    Two of us tried the fish and chips at lunch and we hated it.  The first taste was off-putting.  The breading was crispy and light, but the taste was like the oil was old or the type of oil was wrong.  The fish under the batter was small and it was tasteless and mushy.  The chips, or french fries were OK, but needed some spices.  The ice tea was very good fresh brewed.  Maybe some of the other types of fish are better.  But if what we had is as good as it gets skip this place.  Long John Silvers is better, and I don't recommend them.  My dogs did like the leftovers, but they aren't very discriminating."}
{"text":"If ya want the true taste of English Fish and Chips, this is the only place to go in Arizona. The staff are very friendly and eager to please.  There is surprising amount of different beers on tap, and a broad range of bottom to top shelf spirits to choose from. The specials and off-menu fare change regularly as well. There is a import grocery section; if you want good Cadbury chocolate, there is plenty to choose from here. The prices are low, but the quality is high! The creator and owner, along with family, still work there and put a lot of pride into the food and service."}
{"text":"I have been looking for good english fish and chips in Phoenix.   This is my new favorite!   The fish tasted extremely fresh and actually like English style fish and chips unlike so many other pubs around the valley.    Great english beer selection!"}
{"text":"I have driven by the place for years,I thought I would give it a shot. I really wish I would of kept driving. I ordered 77.00 worth of take out including 3 entrees and 2Apps and did not enjoy any of it. Everything was in the same batter and all tasted the same.. I will keep driving by."}
{"text":"Top notch fish & chips..... I love businesses where the owners are actually working on a regular basis. Owners usually seem to take more pride in their work, than hired help. Thats the case here as they provide Great customer service. Did I mention the fish & chips?"}
{"text":"Fish had no flavor, Chips were soggy and tasted strange.  Took my order to the counter and said that is was terrible.  The young woman replied, \"we don't give refunds\".  She didn't offer something else or ask what was wrong.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It was a weekly spot for me.  Weekends they serve an English Breakfast. $9 flat rate.They offer the meal as a whole or you can a la carte it and buy elements of it.  The breakfast was tasty, always hot. I enjoyed with a pot of hot tea with milk.   As for their namesake, the fish and chips are good. The timing is a bit slow. But it's always hand battered and fried to order. The chips are not typical american thin and crispy, they are thick, a bit soggy, but delicious.  All sauces are on available upon request.  They just recently acquired their liquor license and now you can enjoy a Guiness or New Castle with lunch.   Great place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I made the long haul out from east Mesa specifically for the market. Market is a really strong word for the little corner of product they had. They did have a few interesting things that I had been looking forward to trying. Unfortunately, a lot - and I mean a lot - of the items were out of date! The Heinz Salad Cream had an expiry of January 26, and my visit was on February 23! So...nope. There were a few flavors of Walker's crisps, but they were also all expired. Not by as much as the salad cream, so I did buy two packets thinking at least stale crisps won't give me food poisoning. I'll just stick to Internet ordering, I suppose. With so many of the \"market\" food items out of date, there is just no way I would ever try the restaurant side. I'm sad that it was so disappointing."}
{"text":"By far the best F&C's in the Phoenix Metro Area! I\"m a Brit myself living in AZ and the food is spot on. WARNING: IF you're looking for American style \"fries\" and fish...this is not the place for you. IF you want traditionally British (grease and all) with real mushy peas, real chips cut from real potatoes (not frozen), homemade dessert, pastie etc or a proper English Breakfast  then I highly recommend you check this place out. Even the fryers are imported from the UK. I will definitely be back! ~Thank you & well done!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a local place. Service is attentive but not super friendly. Food is not good The mushrooms for the appetizers are good tho."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place 50 times and I finally stopped in. When I got there it was quiet and only a few customers. I was by myself so i sat at the bar. I did wait 2-3 minutes for the guy to come over because he was talking to 2 other people at the bar. He was not over friendly and not very enthusiastic about serving me.  I have to say I am from new England so I know what good fish and chips look like and taste like. So I ordered the fish and chips.  After waiting what seemed to be an unusually long time my fish and chips was brought to me. it looked good.  But it was not what I expected. it was a little small for the price I paid. The fish was just not as good as it should have been. The fries were average. And it should have been a lot hotter. I was hungry so I did not send it back. He did not come over to ask how everything was till I was more than half done. And I expressed what I am saying here and he did not offer to get me more, replace the order, give me a discount, offer me anything off my next visit and it seemed like ok..........  Well needless to say I would not recommend this place to anyone nor will I go back.  They need to work on the personality of the guy behind the bar, presentation of the food and some personality to the place."}
{"text":"Grew up with a British mother, and I love all the things that they offer!  If I am craving something from my childhood, that is the place to go for me!"}
{"text":"SO close, but just not quite there.  I don't know what it is, but there's an odd back-taste (more noticeable on the chips than the fish) - it just tastes like it's off.  Which it may be, because plenty of stuff in the store seems to be past it's sell-by date.  A real shame, because I think these guys actually know what they're doing - the fish and chips are prepared just right, but spoiled by the odd flavor (which, again, I'm putting down to old oil).  Except the scotch egg - it's AWFUL!  Having been an early customer and semi-frequent visitor, I think my visits have come to an end.  When I SEE so much out of date product and something tastes like it may be off, along with fairly heavy prices, I start to feel like I'm being fleeced by some dodgy geezer.  It's interesting to note that following their two Maricopa County inspections this year, the chose not to request a grade.  I could see 1, if there was an issue they needed to clear up, but back-back?  Just makes me a little suspicious."}
{"text":"First time there and was disappointed in the slow service & fish I ordered. Every fish item on the menu is fried. I asked for the cod fish to be baked. It ended up tasteless & dried out. Waited and waited for the scallop appetizer I ordered but it came out with the dinner. Although the brews & sides were good, I wasn't too impressed with the service or the fish."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try. We had a coupon so why not? I ordered the fried cod and chips and my husband ordered the mahi mahi. We a few shrimp and some onion rings as well. The decor is simple. The place felt a bit warm inside, but it was clean. They have an all u can eat fish fry on fridays.  I just got the large cod and chips plate. It came with 2 meaty, crispy pieces of fish and I did not care for the chips.  But then, I am not a french fry gal anyway. The fish was not greasy and perfectly battered. The tartar sauce is ok. a bit on the sweet side. My husband really enjoyed his mahi mahi with cocktail sauce. I thought the cocktail needed more of a kick, but it was fine.  I LOVE the garlic onion rings. It is a must if you go. Every table had a order of them so i figured they must be good and ordered them. I am glad we did! The dipping sauce is tasty too! If your in the area for some decent grub. Stop in. The service is friendly and the gal at the counter was helpful if you had any questions. They also serve curry,pasties,sweets and much more."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family really bad service had to wait forever & the place was completely empty other then the bartender . I was expecting some delicious food! But was disappointed with it all. Especially for the prices it tasted so bland as well as the bread pudding was really bad ."}
{"text":"Out of curiosity I tried this place yesterday for dinner.  What a mistake.  Worst fish and chips EVER!  Chips were underdone and oily.  The fish was greasy.  I've had better fish and chips at Red Robin."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice in the last year. (I wanted to give it a fair chance so went twice.) On both occasions I could hardly cut through the cod. I have never seen cod like this - I am not sure where they get the fish or how long they have had it in their freezer but I was amazed. I am British  and have been eating fish and chips most  of my life in the UK so I am pretty sure I know what cod should taste like.  The chips were pretty dismal too, and I am not sure what they add to the mushy peas. Hope this helps you decide."}
{"text":"First and foremost they serve neither Coke nor Pepsi products from the fountain. Only RC Cola.   Turning to dinner. Being the first time here I naturally opted for the Fish and Chips ... this is supposed to be English cuisine after all. I chose the large Haddock a very lightly breaded piece of fish.  A Iittle greasy, ok a lot greasy, but very flavorful. The chips needed at least 3 more minutes in the fryer...no color and whimpy.   I gave it three stars as the fish was good, 2-1/2 stars likely more appropriate. I don't expect I'll be back.  I'll look for another fish and chips place next time."}
{"text":"We discovered The Codfather several years ago and have been going 3 or 4 times over the winter months every year since.  It's about 25 minutes from our house in North West Glendale but for us it's worth the trip!  The food is always great as is the service.  We always go on a Friday night and make sure we go early as they do get busy.  I also love the little British goods shop and usually pick up a treat or two after dinner."}
{"text":"You've been warned.   fried food is soaked in grease and recipe for heart attack.  I am sick and couldn't finish meal.  A waste of money"}
{"text":"Cool place I'm not English but I do like the fish and chips. I agree with some of the other reviewers the frys are just stock off the truck frys nothing special. I would recommended it for lunch, you can get in and out pretty quick and its a good change of pace from the normal burger joint"}
{"text":"I enjoy good fish and chips once in a while, so was looking forward to it.  As several others have noted, the batter was bland, too thick, too oily and didn't stay on the fish.  My husband enjoyed the Shepherd's pie.  I would give it another try, but not impressed."}
{"text":"This place has delicious fish and chips. I've only gotten the halibut so far. After the first time I went, I thought about going back all week! I'm new to Phoenix and so far this is my favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Had British fish and chips before and this place was nowhere close to it. Had three orders of the cod and chips to go, got home and noticed how greasy the fish was and the frys tasted like it was frozen, not fresh cut. Petes fish and chips tasted closer to British than this place, only reason I gave it one star, the staff was nice and checked on us even though we were waiting for take outs. Not going back price to high for poor food."}
{"text":"My Father lived in England before I was born and he said he loves the Fish and Chips here they are very authentic. So I had to try it out. WOW! He was right. They were delicious!"}
{"text":"My wife was in a mood for fish & chips, and with the closing of Chuy's (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-_LMicC814) we haven't had a good place for a fish fry.  I searched for Fish & Chips on Yelp and found The Codfather.  I went to England on business last year and I was struck by how British restaurant this place looks.  It was clean but well-worn in a kind of homey way.  Looking past the decor, I noticed the wide-ranging collection of ales and stouts from all over the UK. I asked what beers were on tap and the girl started with Boddington's.  She didn't get any further.  If you haven't tried one, do it.    I went in planning on fish and chips, but then I saw bangers and mash (sausage and mashed potatoes with onion gravy) on the menu.  Wife ordered the cod and chips.  When our orders arrived, wife found the cod flaky and well battered, but a bit greasy.  The bangers and mash were flavorful, but heavy on the salt.  I'd have liked the potatoes better if they had lumps -- I suspect they were instant.  We'll probably go back, sometime but Wife is still missing her favorite fish at Chuy's."}
{"text":"We were visiting relatives in Phoenix, drove by the Long John Silver because we heard of this place run by an Englishman.  I really wanted genuine English Fish & Chips.  The shop is owned and run by Mark, his wife Ruth and Jordan, their son.  Straight from England to Phoenix and what a  treat!  The food is terrific!  Everything!.  Not only Fish & Chips but the whole range of traditional English Pub fare.   I had been in England several times but never ate Fish & Chips there.  Now I don`t have to, we have them here in Phoenix!  Great taste, friendly people, Mark even has a bar next to the shop, like a real English pub!   We were able to speak with Mark while we ate.  Very friendly and has a neat life story to tell.  He also told me about his fish.  What an education!  He uses only wild caught cod, halibut, which was caught in a sustainable manner and has no water, fillers or preservatives added.  The taste?  Fantastic.  If you have been longing for REAL English Fish & Chips, you will be glad you dined at the Codfather."}
{"text":"True English chip shop!  My family is from England and this is one of two places in Arizona that truly hit home for my family and I! We moved here over 20 years ago and it is seriously  good home cooked food!   I don't get to go very often as it is far from me but we get together as often as we can to treat ourselves to an English dinner! The fish and the sausages are just like home the pasties are just like home......okay everything is just like home. The only difference is that they don't serve it in newspaper!   If your looking for something different and can't travel to England this is a must! They even sell some of the goods we can't get anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I visited this place in March 2015. I ordered the Fish and Chips...Normal setting ..nothing Fancy about this place. I worry about the Hygiene of the Staff ..I saw one staff member cough and didnt wash her hands...As for the food, the chips was badly fried..or it looks like they proceeded to give me the bottom of the pot chips..However, I did complain and the server went and brought fresh Chips for me..."}
{"text":"Just left the restaurant at 8:40 after being told we could not order food to eat in. When we first walked in at 8:35 we were told to have a seat by the waitress and she would bring us menus. A short time later she came back and said she was just told we could order to go bit we couldn't eat in. WTF!!! You don't close till 9:00p and you tell customers that!! To top it off, we drive almost an hour to eat there as we heard good things about the place. Never be back again!!! What a joke!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the fish and chips very much. Fries needed seasoned but the fish was great. Also the crab cake was best we have ever had. Super moist! Server was very nice."}
{"text":"Great place near my house. I love the cheesecakes and the fish tacos are good too. I usually sit at the bar area but it also has a dining section."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The cod fish and chips is delicious. The same goes for the Mahi. The large is definitely the way to go. The service was a little on the slow side, but the friendly service and food more than made up for it. They've earned a new customer."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this family run business since they first opened their doors in Fountain Hills - that was certainly a trek from my house in Buckeye! But it was worth it for some of the taste of home. Luckily, they moved to Bell Road, and I moved to Scottsdale, so I am much happier.... but not really. The restaurant is split into the food side and the bar side. I think the owner would rather concentrate on the bar business, because I never see him on the restaurant side - and that is a shame, because the consistency of the food being delivered is pretty awful. On some days I feel like I am on the Brighton seafront, eating fish and chips just like home... on other days the food is terrible, and I would rather eat that bag'o'shite they sell at Pete's Fish'n'Chips. The Codfather needs to keep an eye on quality control - it is not acceptable to serve chips that are fried in oil that is so old that everything tastes bitter. Likewise, cod should be a flaky, white fish - on my last visit with my family 3 of the 4 cod fillets had a grey streak through the fillet that none of us could cut through. This is as close to comfort food as us Brits are going to find in the Phoenix area. However, if this was my local 'chippie' back home, I wouldn't be happy to give them my custom. With every visit I leave more and more disappointed. On a positive note, some of the other menu items are very good - the bangers and mash always catches my eye, as does the steak and kidney pie. But, if you are going to call yourself a fish and chip restaurant, then you really should get the basics right.... and this restaurant fails in this regard."}
{"text":"Off the bat, I want to say that my review has absolutely nothing to do with the food I ordered. The fish and chips were phenomenal and honestly, the best I've had outside of London.   Unfortunately, I don't think I will return due to the poor service we received on Sunday.   We met another couple at the restaurant who had already been seated and the waitress took our drink orders. I had been craving a bloody mary and saw that they were on happy hour. After the order was placed it was about 7-10 minutes before my boyfriend's beer arrived even though there were only about 4 or 5 other tables occupied.   I glanced up at the waitress wondering where my drink was and she explained to me that while they had all of the things they needed to make a bloody mary, they were out of well vodka. And she could have them make me a bloody mary if I still wanted it, but I would not be receiving happy hour price.   I indicated that I would still like my drink (I didn't even receive the water that I ordered) but after she walked away, I couldn't figure out why I was being charged for the restaurants poor planning - if you run out of well vodka and still have 30 minutes left in your happy hour, you should serve the next vodka you have in stock and plan better next time.   My drink was prepared and sat at the bar until the waitress came to take our order. I hadn't seen the drink sitting there until I looked at the waitress like, \"Am I going to get my drink?\" and she found it. One of the guys at our table told me it had just been sitting there. At this point we had been at the restaurant for over 20 minutes and I still hadn't gotten the water I ordered.   Food took a long time to come out and while we were waiting, a guy from the back of the restaurant stood to roll silverware at the bar. He kept laughing at the stories we were telling at the table and made VERY strange and uncomfortable eye contact with me and the other female at the table every time we glanced up at the television above him. Eventually we made a point to glance elsewhere.   By the end of our meal, our waitress was eating her dinner next to our table behind the bar and dropping food down the front of her.   That being said, the food was incredible. Fish and chips cooked to perfection and the tartar sauce was quite good as well. This would absolutely be my go-to restaurant for fish and chips if the whole experience wasn't so strangely off-putting."}
{"text":"This place is great for the Friday Fish Fry. They also have an all you can eat special on Fridays. I also love their Margaretta's. They are made from scratch."}
{"text":"This is probably the best fish and chips this side of the Atlantic. It's a treat whenever I can make it out to this side of town! I just this place was closer to me. The food tastes fresh, the fish is lightly breaded and the fries are a little soggy. But that's the way the made it when I was in England in 2009. That may be where some people may have a difference of opinion as far as preference for their fries. If you're from across the pond and want a taste and atmosphere that reminds you of home, this is the place to be. Only thing different is the music. I can't wait to go back to England to explore more of such a wonderful country and people. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My parents were born and raised in England and as a surprise I took them to Codfather while they were out visiting.  My Mother can be hard to please but she really enjoyed the food.  My kids and I love the fish and chips while my husband really enjoyed the steak and kidney pie. Don't go in here expecting American food.  You probably won't find the soda you like and they don't have a typical American kids menu but the food is excellent and well worth a try."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a great family owned business with friendly owners. The food is always amazing and desserts are delicious. The service really shows that the staff cares and we enjoy seeing Mark and Ruth when we stop in. My husband and I started coming here for happy hour years ago and now come in with our son for family meals and every experience has us wanting more. I enjoy seeing a family owned business in my neighborhood and will continue to spread the word!"}
{"text":"All right,  Get off your shagging, high horse, forget your  fast food, expect some (much needed abuse from Mark And Ruth (the owners) and stuff your face with the best fish and chips in the valley (coming from a \"Brit\" take it as Gospel) Poker night, a bar, bands, a British shop with all the yummy, very bad for you chocolate, crisps, sausage, meat pies, and all the other things that are sooooooo bad for us but oh, my god, taste...sooooooo good. Go here, forget your 60's and just enjoy the family run business that never fails to deliver."}
{"text":"The fish and chips were decent, but my husband's shepherd's pie was literally a frozen TV dinner that they'd microwaved - in a black plastic dish and everything.   (Also, the vinegar was definitely watered down. I could barely taste it even after saturating the fish.)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but it just didn't live up to the expectations I had. My friends had visited Codfather many times and often craved their fish and chips. I finally decided to tag along as I love seafood and they made it seem so intriguing. For my meal, I went with their recommendation and ordered the fish and chips. The breading on my fish was soggy and greasy, so the texture was unappetizing. The fish itself, while it seemed was decent quality, didn't have much flavor and the chips were also bland. My friends still seemed to think it was okay, but I've had plenty of good fish in my day and this, in my opinion, wasn't it. The price is a little high for the amount and quality of food you get, so I have yet to return and I'm not sure I will."}
{"text":"Awesome fish n chips and it stood up to some places we ate at in San Diego.  If you want some greasy fish and chips look no further!"}
{"text":"Still awful food, feel bad that people would actually consider this to be typical British food. Go to Rosie's on Camelback, much better ."}
{"text":"Great service great food!   Brought me back to the old school with the RC fountain drink."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try the Cod Father as I love Fish and Chips, Pies Sausage rolls etc.  It was some of the worst food I have had in a long time , the fish was chewy and hard , the batter was soggy and flavorless.  Even the Malt vinigar was watered down and had no taste.  My husbands meat pasty was tasty but the Sausage roll was so dry and hard it was pretty much inedible.  Maybe it was because we ate at 8:30pm but that should never be an excuse. I am sorry but I would not recommend this restaurant to any one."}
{"text":"Thank God I found this place in Arizona.. its not too much to look at from the outside but the bar area is perfect for a few drinks and to watch the football.  Being from the UK its Hilarious reading other reviews from people claiming the chips to be soggy .. if you want sugary crispy fries go to McDonalds ! This is authentic \"Fish and Chips\" exactly as you would get in a UK chip shop, amazing crispy batter on the fish and chips, needs lots of salt and vinegar to compliment as always. Mushy peas and gravy have always been spot on for me at this place..just like home! They even had some blackcurrant to put in my pint of Blackthorn..Nice!  Only issue for me is I couldn't clearly see the prices for the items in the shop, I didn't know how much the meat and potato pies were."}
{"text":"I'm sure this place is good, but my experience could've been better. I ordered the cod and chips, with fried pickles as an appetizer. The pickles were just fried pockets of oil, that exploded when you bit into them. When I got the fish & chips, the fish had a shrimp tail embedded in the fried coating."}
{"text":"I've visited this place about 3 times now and each time it gets better. The fish is tasty, chips are perfect just how I like them. We tried the white chocolate cheesecake and it was really great. Big enough to split with another person but I probably could've finished it on my own it was so good. Great service and great food :)"}
{"text":"Went with a group (8 people roughly) of people on a sunday around 430p. We were the only ones in the restaurant except one person at the bar. Drinks were quick, ordered food, which took a little longer than expected but nothing to be mad about. Most ordered the fish and chips but a few ordered chicken tenders. Everything was ok, the chicken was flavorless. No seasoning on it at all. Very bland, so they covered it up with ketchup. The fish was just ok, again not much flavor but lots of grease of course. She didn't offer salad dressings so we ate plain salads unless we went over to the \"store\" where the waitress hangs out and asks for it. Huge issue that happens a lot is places is there was nowhere to change the baby's diaper.  I had to go to the car to change it."}
{"text":"Again top notch British fare ven a little store where you can buy the British goods you miss so much from home this is a little gem at 16th Street and Bell. You should not miss breakfast Saturdays and Sundays are awesome you gotta do it for a traditional English Brekkie"}
{"text":"I haven't been in for over a year --- The remodel is EXCELLENT and classy! Gone is the spartan look in favor of upgraded tables and chairs, paint job, and expanded bar. The most AUTHENTIC English fish n chips in the Phoenix area are still served PERFECTLY! Excellent crunch, great taste. Had the large cod n chips and a sausage roll for lunch over the weekend. SCRUMPTIOUS! I wish the pastry on the sausage roll was a bit fluffier, but I could still eat those every day. You've come a long way over the 10 years I've known ya, KEEP IT UP! INSIDE SKINNY: The beer and cider list is large and SOLID, concentrating on many English and Irish brands but there are others too including those you'd find in a pub IN ENGLAND like one of my faves Fuller's London Pride on tap (1845 and Vintage Ale in bottles according to the website), Carlsberg and Estrella Damm (a Barcelona favorite). All you can eat fish on Friday. Coleman's hot English mustard on request for your sausage roll. English groceries behind the counter like chocolate, Heinz salad cream, Cadbury chocos, and beans for your toast."}
{"text":"These are the worst fish and chips I've ever had in my life.  I could not even cut the fish with my fork.  The fries tasted awful!  Could've gotten better at a fast food restaurant! The atmosphere is terrible and awkward. The place is very run down!  Will not be back EVER again."}
{"text":"Roy 'The Hungry Englishman'  For those of you who are in a rush then my 'Five Star' rating says it all, this place is the best and importantly the most AUTHENTIC 'Chippy' that I have yet to find in the US.  However as is usual with my reviews I feel a little more in-depth comments are warranted so if you feel so inclined here you go.  As you have likely guessed from my moniker I am English born and bred, although  I must say it is my very good fortune to now call this wonderful country my home.  To the surprise of my (American) wife I don't get homesick at all but it is true to say that I do occasionally crave the odd bite or two that I grew up on, fish and chips included.  To this end my ever thoughtful wife has always been keen to find me an 'authentic' fish & chip restaurant as we travel this great country and I can say that finally we found one at the Codfather in Phoenix Arizona of all places.  I have tried so called 'authentic' British fish & chips all over the country and although most have been a very pleasant meal 'authentic' they were certainly not.  For one thing if you mention 'mushy peas' they look at you rather strangely whereas this is likely one of the most common sides you can get at every single 'chippy' in good old Blighty.  And don't get me started on the battered fish (or lack there of)....aside from the batter being wrong so called 'authentic' British fish & chip restaurants here in the US are under the misguided illusion that two 'finger' sized portions of fish is the thing to offer, when anyone who has ever eaten the real thing knows that one always gets a large filet of fish (usually hanging over the edge of your plate).  Anyway enough of my ranting on about all the places that are getting it wrong and let me chat about the ONLY place I have yet found that is getting it totally RIGHT..namely the Codfather.  What can I say.....FINALLY...a real Chippy..!  The place is very unpretentious but pleasant and comfortable, I think the lady owner is British as I heard an accent in the background and sadly the opportunity to introduce myself didn't arise (perhaps next time, cuz you know I'm going back).  I ordered my standby old favorite (fish, chips & mushy peas) and I was not disappointed, everything was just like I grew up on, totally authentic, so much so I over stuffed a little and couldn't eat for the rest of the day.  The 'chippy' also has a little British grocery section in, so I took advantage and stocked up on a few goodies.  It is also worth pointing out that the price for the meal was very reasonable indeed.  This I found very pleasing as growing up in a poor neighborhood with not much money as a kid, fish & chips was always a cheap meal  (hence the phrase 'cheap as chips').  Perhaps Americans won't find the real British fish & chips to their taste and that's okay but if you really do want to experience the real thing then this is the place to go.  Whenever my wife and I travel down to Phoenix (about every six weeks) we are going to make it a priority to have our lunch at the Codfather.  I would like to say a sincere 'well done' to the proprietors for a great experience and creating a genuine bit of Britain here in the US.        Happy eating, Roy"}
{"text":"The food is OK nothing to get too excited about the staff are more of a turnoff the  owner is  disinterested , not at all welcoming and the son is borderline  hostile. This puts a bad taste in your mouth , there are too many good places to in our city where you can have a nice meal and receive pleasant service. I would leave them to their bad moods and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is my first time and last time at this restaurant and it wasn't a good experience. My wife and I had the fish and chips for lunch all you can eat. The fish was greasy the fries were soggy and no coleslaw. The total bill was $40 which is really high all considering for lunch."}
{"text":"Two visits in the past two weeks, yep it's that good! The fish and chip is superb!!! Good sized portions of cod and light crisp coating. Also had the Bangers and Mash, another hit!. Place is a bit funky but that's part of the working man's restaurant charm."}
{"text":"\"British cuisine\"...this phrase is often seen as an oxymoron by Americans.  Unfortunately The Codfather does nothing to dispel this notion. First - The physical building. I was expecting a cozy, British \"Local\".  A pub with some personality.  The Codfather has a bar and a brightly lit dining area with cheap card tables.  So no to cozy. Second - The food.  I ordered the Haddock and Chips.  The chips (French fries) were perhaps the worst I have ever eaten.  Soggy and extremely bland.  Thank God for salt and vinegar.  If not for those two condiments the chips were like eating fried wax.  The Haddock was authentic British and I actually liked that.  The Haddock actually allowed me to give a second star As much as it disappoints me to say it given I grew up in the British Isles, I would prefer to eat Long John Silvers or Captain D's rather than this mess.  Perhaps stop by the Codfather and purchase the Haddock and then stop by Five Guys and get the fries.  Those fries remind me of the style I had growing up."}
{"text":"I don't like bashing or promoting negative reviews, but somethings I can't let go.  This was one of the worst meals I've ever had in a long time.  I had a craving for some fish and chips and ended giving this place a try, since its real close to my house.  Boy was that a mistake.  I can tell you right away what the big issue was...It's the OIL that they fry their food in.  My lady and I arrived to this place on a Saturday night.  They had all you can eat fish fry.  I ordered that for 14.95 and we split some jalapeno poppers/fried mushrooms and extra fries.  All of the food had a nasty aftertaste and it was due to the old oil that they fry the food in.  I come from a family of restaurant owners and I've worked the fryer station for years and I can tell that was the problem.  The fish and chips were terrible.  The batter was falling off from the fish, the fries were soggy and the other fried food was plain gross.  I was looking forward to a good Saturday night meal, but we left very disappointed and unhappy.  I would not recommend this place at all.  I should only give it one star, but the service was decent and the place felt clean.  Eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"This place is truly a Gem among Gems...it gets The Highest Review for a few reasons: Great Food. Very authentic English Cod and awesome Pasties!   They also have a mini English-only mart with British snacks (Smarties, Crunchies, Walkers Chips and much more) they EVEN have Barley Water if you're looking for bitterness in a bottle.   The BEST part, however, is the Bar which is NOT very big, but don't let the size and strip-mall feel deceive you, they probably have one of the best and most diverse draft beer selections in town. On Tap is NewCastle, London Pride, & Tetley's as for others they have Smithwicks, Kilt Lifter and they're always rotating great other beers in and out.   They also have a Guinness Surger which takes pure but flat Guinness and sends an ultra-sonic pulse through the pint glass, releasing the gases in the Guinness beer, which then settles into a smooth velvet pint with a creamy head. In my opinion BETTER than Guinness draft, you MUST try one!  They have a very cool Tuesday Open-Mic Night and other nightly specials. It's inexpensive, with a friendly staff and not too far off the 51 or the 101...All around a 5/5!"}
{"text":"I had the cod & english fires. ...they were perfect...fucking perfect! If the tables were a little cleaner, I would have given 5 stars. ...I will be back again & again!"}
{"text":"We visited The Codfather recently, not really knowing what to expect nor really having any preconceived notions, as I hadn't looked on Yelp yet.    First impressions - I was really disappointed that there wasn't more of a pub atmosphere.  The interior is very close to being fast food, and not even as nice as some.  You order at a counter and the food is delivered to your table.  I would agree with the earlier reviewers on some things.  I ordered the large portion of the Cod fish & chips.  I thought the portion size and the fish were quite good.  The batter was crispy and not greasy.  The chips were terrible though.  They were limp, soggy and tasted as if the oil should have been changed about two weeks ago.  I also had some shrimp which were good, but not outstanding.  I too was put off by the cheap \"nickel and dime\" approach - $.25 for more tartar sauce????  And I didn't like the $.35 surcharge for using my debit card.  I thought for a minute I was at ARCO's fish and chips!!     So, the fish was a 4, the chips were a 1, and the decor was maybe a 3.  I have to stretch to give The Codfather a 3 overall.  We will probably keep getting the fish, but for take-out."}
{"text":"I had lunch here and we ordered the fried zucchini as an appetizer that was yummy but the cod with chips was overly greasy, the grease is still stuck to my pallet. Sorry to say but Pete's fish and chips is better."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. I enjoy this quaint pub. A side bonus is that they serve RC Cola here, which I happen to enjoy. The first time I ate here I got the small cod with the extra 2 deep fried shrimp. The second time I was there with my cousin and we split the calamari. I got the Cornish Pasty and she got the Bangers and mash. Out of everything, the bangers and mash is my absolute favorite. Mashed potatoes with gravy, 2 sausages and peas. The Cornish Pasty was the best hot pocket I've ever had. My cod was cooked well too. My issue was with the seafood in general. Both the shrimp and the calamari had a texture I did not enjoy. Both were kinda slimy even though they were both deep fried. I feel like it was just me, but my cousin noticed that the calamari was a little different as well. Overall still really good. They have drink specials and TVs everywhere as well. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The fish they use is high quality, you can see and taste it but that is about it for positive comments. We went on the 1st Friday of Lent and the place was packed. We saw a 2 top table at the bar so we grabbed it. The table was greasy and dirty, complete with a dollop of tartar sauce smack dab in the middle. The miserable bartender sluggishly came over and took our order. I guess we had to run a tab since we were sitting in the bar area bc she took our credit card when we ordered. No big deal except she when she brought it back she slapped it down right on top of the tartar sauce spill left on the center of the table. She either didn't notice or didn't care that the table was filthy bc she never wiped it down for us and she was so ornery looking we were afraid to ask her to do it for us. We were not in a crazy hurry to eat but the people around us were getting restless. Apparently, some of them had been waiting for over an hour for their order. Now, I try to be as understanding as possible but seriously? It doesn't take that long to fry fish. The nasty bartender just replied to the complaining customers that the kitchen got slammed with orders and it was taking a long time. No apology just an excuse. Ok, I get it ,they got hit with a bunch of orders at once. They were busy, I understand,  it was the first Friday of Lent but of course they were busy!!!! It is a fish restaurant on the 1st Friday of Lent! One would think that the owners would have planned their staffing a bit differently. We got our food and the bf loved his but mine was cold. On the way to the bathroom, I nearly slid to my death on a smashed french fry  or \"chip\" because none of the staff bothered to pick it or any of the other trash up off the floor. The bathroom is locked and you have to get a key (on a hanger) from the cashier. What kind of legit restaurant locks their bathroom like a gas station? The place is disgusting, the service is terrible, and the food is inconsistent. I don't think we'll be making a follow up trip to the Codfather."}
{"text":"Great Great fast Serice even if it was a bit crowded. I ordered salmon and cod small order with chips and cole slaw.  Two med sized salmon and 1 large cod  Awesome Awesome first time here I shall return.  The flavor was fresh with the deep fried crunch. Yummy if you crave fish with a crunch.  The fish did not get soggy and kept its crunch through out my meal.  Chips were super and the cole slaw was out of this world...they do something something to keep it crunchy.  Super selection of ciders.  I will need to try the rest of the menu. Well worth the trip from way up north."}
{"text":"Last night I was in the mood for seafood. I even thought about going to the store, buying some fresh fish, and making it at home. Then someone suggested to try The Codfather. It's not far from where we live, and was open late. So we did. The reviews online are mixed... But it was worth giving it a shot. Glad we did.  The Codfather is awesome! Such a cool little place, great atmosphere and the food looked and tasted authentic. I might have to take someone from England for the real test. Oh, and they have a lot of English beers on tap. They are all served on nitro, too, which was a nice touch.   In the end, we left full and happy, and am glad we tried it. I will go back, but take my English friends to verify the authenticity. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Sausage roll was excellent, although a little soggy.  Cod was pretty good too, although a bit greasy.  They could easily fix this by serving on paper, but it was still pretty good.  I'd like to come back and try the meat pies sometime, its been forever since I had a proper meat pie.  They've got a small English grocery section as well.  Crisps and other goodies that are hard to come by in the colonies.  I just wish it wasn't 35 miles across Phoenix traffic to come here from where we live.  If you're in the area, though, its worth sticking your head in.  They have a pretty wide selection of food and lots of great beers to choose from."}
{"text":"The Codfather was one of those places I wasn't expecting too much from and got way more than I expected. I've now ate almost everything on the menu in some form or another and I have never been underwhelmed with anything I have gotten. They have a great beer selection and a fantastic selection of fried appetizers.   The fish and chips are definitely the flagship here but don't sleep on their more traditional stuff. The pies are great here and bangers and mash and all of the different \"versions\" of it on the menu are all fantastic. If I had to recommend my favorite dishes to a newcomer here other than the obvious fish and chips platter the \"banger, bubble & squeek,  and beans\" and the \"beef and kidney pie\" are both my favorites the deep fried sausage is also one of those things where it's so good you don't care about the heart attack it's going to for sure give you.  Pros: I have ate here at least 15 times trying most if not everything on the menu and I have never had anything bad or even so-so. Everything has been steller. As long as you understand you are eating at a fish n chip/fried food joint and not a fancy seafood resteraunt you won't be dissapointed. They also have a pretty great beer selection on tap.  Cons: Now even though I can promise you I have never ate something here that wasn't good if I seriously had to nit pick a con here it would have to be pricing. I feel like EVERY dish excluding the English breakfast I pay 1 dollar too much for. Just comparing it to similar resteraunts serving similar things this place is a little pricier than most. It's not so overpriced that it should stop you from eating here but it does prevent me from say, eating there regularly, even though the food deserves it. They also seem to have a difficult time keeping the beer they have on tap stocked regularly. Every time I sit at the bar at least one beer on tap is out. Meh. Not a big deal but just an observation.  All in all \"The Codfather\" is one of those places that you not only have to try but will undoubtedly make you want to come back again and again. The only reason it doesn't have the 5 star is that I can't walk in there and have a beer and meal and walk out spending less than 30 dollars after the tip. A little more than I expect when going to a place like that. But WOW they are seriously consistently great with everything they have on that menu! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I know the English's reputation for bland food. If you were raised on English (read: BLAND) food, then this may be right up your alley. For someone who appreciates things with flavor, The Codfather did not impress. Like the prior reviewer's experience, there was a lot of grease and/or sogginess. The \"chips\" were inedible. Such a foul, bitter taste. Why?! They're french fries! And NO air conditioning?? It was SO hot in there. The beer was ok. The owner was friendly; that is why I gave 2 stars. But we will not be back. Too many other tasteful options in this town."}
{"text":"We went into the Codfather after hearing all the positive vibe and came away...satisfied.  The atmosphere was perfect for us. I love the look and feel of a good English pub, and while the location is a little worse for wear, it was just fine.  We had the fried mushrooms and zucchini as appetizers and I gotta say: really damn good. The garlic breading on those were amazing.  For meals we had the cod and the crab legs. The cod was admittedly just okay; if they used the same garlic breading, it would probably be amazing, but their normal beer batter was rather flavorless. The crab legs were fantastic, though.  The service was quite good, which definitely helped raise my score from 3 stars to 4. In all, we'll be back, but next time, we'll look at some shepherd's pie!"}
{"text":"Stopped in Sunday afternoon by myself. They've done a nice remodel since the last time I was there which was about two years ago. I dont do fried and it was like pulling teeth to get the waitress to give me options. Ordered haddock and salad. Sat 20 minutes with nothing in front of me and then salad came with fish. Both were ok but not for the price and why not bring the salad out ahead? I found the atmosphere unfriendly"}
{"text":"Best in Phoenix Shepard's Pie!  Food here is truly authentic English, highly recommend if you are looking for that.  English Pub too."}
{"text":"Codfather = Cod Awful!!!  Fish mushy, falling apart, and swimming in grease (not in a good way) - check.   Overdone scallops so tiny almost needed a microscope to see them - check. \"Chips\" that tasted like they came out of from a frozen bag purchased at the grocery store - check. Rude employees - check. Overpriced - check.  How in the hell did we spend $30+ on strip mall food?  What in the hell just happened?    From what I could see of the fish, that hadn't fallen apart from all of the oil, it seemed to be pretty good quality, which is what the one star is for.  If this is seriously what fish n' chips are like in the UK, then I feel sorry for you blokes.  Go to Rosie McCaffrey's near downtown if you want a good fish n' chip experience."}
{"text":"Last week my Brother bought fried fish and mozzarella sticks. The fish was falling apart with soggy fries and the mozzarella sticks were old the cheese tasted very chewy."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Codfather today Sunday lunch time only 2 people at a table but people at the bar. We wanted some chicken oxo which they did not have but we did learn that their import food section was way overpriced,we can buy most of those items at World Market and even our local Frys supermarket for a lot less. So we decide to stay for lunch I was going to have a brew and my wife ordered the cod fish and chips,we are seniors and do not eat a big lunch plus we need to watch our pennys. I made the mistake of telling the waitress we would share,which is what a lot of people do in the UK when buying fish and chips. She said that would be a $3 plate charge,I said we do not need two plates  we will share off the one plate in the middle. She said \"It doesn't work that way it is still a $3 charge\". I am going to pay them $3 so I can share a few chips with my wife?I don't think so,we got up and left and will never go back. Was it worth loosing a customer over $3 well that is what they have done,we were going to bring family there when they were in town but that is not going to happen now."}
{"text":"Location: In a strip mall, not very impressive on the outside Interior: At least two dirty tables at all times, odd layout with a tiny bar and a seating area for the restaurant, no host, another tiny area where they sell goods from Europe  Staff: not so friendly and knowledgable about menu(food and drinks) Alcoholic beverages: great for beer on tap & mixed drinks Food:Wayyyyyyy toooooo GREASY!!!!!!!  Everything is saturated in grease!  It's like they do not take the time to allow the oil in the fryer to get hot enough in order for the food to be cooked on the inside and for the grease to drip out when they bring it out of the fryer!!! You can see the oil float under the heavily battered & bland fried fish. Their tartar sauce and watered down vinegar is of no help! And their chips(fries)- Soggy, tasteless, limp, always cold.   You have been warned."}
{"text":"Pretty neat food, never been to GB before and have always wanted to try what English people eats.  My friend and I decided to come here for some delicious grub.  Every time we go to different restaurants, we always want to order Calamari and see how it taste and this wasn't that bad at all.  It's not very salty compared to other restaurants.  I never knew English people call their fries, chips, good to know that I won't call the wrong name next time.  We also ordered crab cake which was very filling.    It wasn't very crowded and the service was really excellent.  We will definitely come here again the next time we are in the area.  Great food!"}
{"text":"My friend and I shared fish & chips and shepherd's pie. The fish was excellent. We ended up ordering more! I didn't enjoy the taste of the shepherd's pie but my friend loved it. Beware- it is served piping hot straight from the oven!   They have all you can eat fish on Saturday."}
{"text":"This place kinda reminds me of something on Kitchen Nightmares....  The Environment- extremely outdated. No particular theme, not very cozy or pub-like. Just random British paraphernalia throughout.  The Food- most of it was okay. Just okay. The fish was bit greasy, but certainly nothing special. The fries (chips)....were just awful. They were cold, tasteless, and frankly, worse than frozen fries.  The Service- granted it was a Friday night and it was busy, so I can't give the severs too much blame, but everything took forever! Drinks took 10 minutes, appetizers 20 minutes, then the food came out before we even finished our appetizer. We never were asked for refills on our drinks and it took 20 minutes for our server to realize we were ready to pay.  Just save yourself from the disappointment. Super cool name, but it ends there."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner this weekend.  Something happened  to move the experience from pretty good to great.  The sausage roll and shepherd's pie were amazing with a perfectly done light, flaky crust.  The fish we had was perfectly done.  Still too much footie on the tellie though."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill!! The beer and the cocktail sauce was good. Way too Greasy and fish was rubbery. I could tell different cook from the last time we  were there."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for some fish and chips and this place hit the spot. We went early around 3:30 and not a soul was inside. I was a bit concerned about this but we ordered the Cod fish and chips, as they had an assortment of fish to select from, and we ordered some onion rings. The onion rings were amazing! They had this seasoning that they could have battered everything in and I would have been A-Ok. The fish and chips were also very decent quality. They have a small European food market type of thing and some interesting menu items if you are into English food like bangers and mash. The staff was polite and attentive. I'm sure ill be back the next craving i get."}
{"text":"Funky, divey, old English place, with pretty good food, but in dire need of a facelift. Had the Friday-Saturday special, all you can eat fish & chips. I should have just had the large because I couldn't eat but one piece more than originally served! Yet, the fish and chips were pretty authentic and good. The Saturday (early) evening we were there, place was packed- Every table was occupied. Good for them. Bad for me was that the service took a long time, albeit very friendly. And, my major beef, is that the entire place REALLY needs an update. Just close one Sunday and get 10 people to put up new blnds, paint, re-do EVERYTHING! Plastic picnic tables? C'mon Man. It'd be so much more pleasant, clean, and inviting if it had a facelift. I'll help."}
{"text":"Fun place. The food is surprisingly good and they have a good selection of drinks. There's a market inside for various English things, including big jars of marmite!"}
{"text":"Something was wrong with the Cod Fillets......I have eaten there before and it was pretty good but the texture seemed really strange. My wife didn't finish hers, and I took mine home for the fuzz balls. Maybe it was just a bad day in the kitchen, staff were nice and friendly though. The Scotch eggs were good and that helped."}
{"text":"Jordan is the best bartender here !!! We always get our food so fresh and so crispy!!! The beer we like is 1664, it's sort of like a better bud light, same crispness but more flavor. I showed this place to my inlaws and we've come here every weekend since! Can't get away..."}
{"text":"I went here with my father last weekend.  He's up for anything 'all you can eat', so I decided to join him for dinner and check it out.    The place is not fancy at all.  It's a typical strip mall- type restaurant.      We both had the 'all you can eat' fish & chips dinner and the best thing I can say about it was that I was there with my dad.   I felt that the fish was very oily and greasy-- more breading than fish, and the 'chips' were little pieces of french fries-- almost like hash browns.   You had to wait forever to get your 'fish' refilled.  It was interesting watching the cooks & wait staff eating, drinking, and chatting while we were waiting for more fish.    The place was pretty popular and filled up fast.  I wish I had tried something else on the menu, because a lot of people seemed to be enjoying their food.    I'd give it another try, even just to sit and hang out with my dad.  :)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times in the past. Once when they first opened. On my last visit the place was bigger and now serving alcohol. Maybe that is the best way to enjoy this place to the fullest?  This is a British style restaurant with Fish and Chips the way they make it back home. My Son-in-law is from England and he LOVES this place. They have several popular items that you would get overseas. Mushy Peas, Bangers / Mash / Gravy, Bubble/Bangers/Beans and many others.  Inside is decorated with everything you would expect if you were vacationing in GB. They also have a nice market with items that you may not find in your typical grocery store.  We have had the Cod, Haddock, Jalapeno Poppers (LOL) and looking forward to possibly trying the Walleye in a future lifetime.  The food is somewhat bland tasting to my palate. Maybe that is how they like it over there. The fish seems a little more greasy than we would prefer and a napkin is needed to soak up the excess. Hmmm?  Service is friendly and the dining experience and menu are worth checking out. Would have to say that there are better places for Fish in my opinion. But then again ... this is how they do it over in the Queen's backyard. TALLY HO!  3 STARS"}
{"text":"This place rocks.  My visit was identical to my experience eating in the U.K..   The food was great I particularly was fond of the fish and chips, the people were very nice and prompt and the place was super clean what more can you say about it. If you want to experience the British cuisine in the United States this is the place to go The Codfather ROCKS..."}
{"text":"I was born & raised in New England, Moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, visited the UK  and later lived on Maui ,Hawaii so I know good fish & chips. I can speak with some authority when I say here in Phoenix good fish & chips is hard to find.   The good news is The Codfather Fish and chips is the way it was meant to be made.  A large crispy coating, and fries deep fried to perfection.  If you are looking for this classic dish, you will not find a better place than the Codfather. GIANT piece of fried fish and it was delicious. Crispy, soft, juicy, flavourful, perfect with a little vinegar. Amazingly delicious. the chips were golden, fluffy, crispy on the outside but not so much that they can't absorb a generous amount of malt vinegar. For the price, could you really ask for more  My wife & I ordered the cod, which was a HUGE portion and a side of large chips.  The cod was breaded and cooked to a perfectly crispy and crunchy consistency, while still maintaining the moist fish.     FOOD: I ordered the cod, which was a HUGE portion and a side of large chips.  The cod was breaded and cooked to a perfectly crispy and crunchy consistency, while still maintaining the moist fish. I can say that the fish was fresh and the oil that it was cooked in was clean. The fish was fresh as it didn't taste fishy. The fries were lightly fried and it didn't taste too oily which was a good thing. The The chips were delicious ! PRICE: For the price, could you really ask for more.CONCLUSION:  Grab that malt vinegar and pour it on, because this fish and chip stop is the one to enjoy."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times in silent protest as my friends love it.  First time few times I have gone there was during the summer and there was no air conditioning on.   Last few times they had a swamp cooler which is not cool when you are trying to eat. and it did not make the crackers and cookies I purchased there at a premium very crunchy either.  I since seen that some of the items they sell are on sale all the time either at Safeway's, Cost Plus and WholeFoods.    They do seem to have slightly better air now and a bunch of wobbly old ceiling fans just ready to cool your meal down quick.   I find this place extremely expensive for what it is and what you get.   Considering you are likely to spend $10 at least on any main entree you get a surprisingly small amount of chips or is it just me???   I say that because I have recently discovered something quite shocking about the CF.   As I have already state I go here under pressure as I do have friends who like this place, US and UK friends.  For the couple of games England was playing in the Euro this year I went and had lunch at CF with my US friends.  First off even though England was playing right then... no one working was wearing anything patriotic.   3 of us in our party was from the US, and one person for the UK. We all ordered at the same time and had the same thing.  Large fish n chips.   The UK guy's meal came out 10 minutes after everyone and was a noticeably smaller.  This was not the first time I have experienced this?  I questioned the other UK people back at my company to find that the British people in my office really do not like the CF as they feel they do not get treated the same way as the Americans!   Really???   That is something I just don't get from English owned store.  I thought it was just me but it isn't.   Four people in my company are from England and we feel the same.  My American friends that go love the staff and the food.   Go figure."}
{"text":"We waited over  10 minutes just us have somebody say hello to us when we changed our beer our waitress right in front of us rolled her eyes.  We waited an additional half hour for our food and there was only three of the table in the restaurant we only ordered a crabcake some clam chowder soup and a meet pocket. That was it.. The meat pocket can out over done.. When I said something she replied that how they alway come out.. Saying all this the food was ok.. She also sweep the whole restaurant as we eat.. Even under our table and chairs... I've been here a few time a the food descent to good the service & ambience not so much.. Needs management."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the cod father many many times, I love the food the Ambiance is  average . Today I ate there for lunch and had fresh cod and chips with tartar sauce, I asked for more tartar sauce and the waitress said that will be 25 cents , I could not believe what she said the fish and chips are in themselves on the expensive side and to add $.25 for more tartar sauce is ridiculous and an insult , I asked for the manager and even though he did not agree there was nothing he could do because that was the word from the lady and gentlemen that own it, the British couple, so I checked on the menu and nowhere on the menu does it say extra tartar sauce 25cents , it's not the money it's the principle, I find that very cheap and unacceptable at the  prices they charge you should get as many tartar sauces as your need . I personally will never go back, that did it for me"}
{"text":"I think John's 10/25/11 review is the most helpful, and so I can only share some of my observations. I think this place would be really cool if it were retro-60's British fish & chips, the sort of place Austin Powers would have gone to. *Contemporary* British is a huge problem for me if it means huge banners of Prince William or Harry or Whoever It Is & What's-Her-Name and God Save The Queen coffee mugs with the queen on it. Huge turn-off for me. I'm just glad they (England) got the 2012 Olympics because that will inevitably make for a more pleasant dining experience.   I don't like LJS's fast-food \"fish\" at all. I did like The Codfather's fish & chips here, tastes much better. I also liked that their silverware (even at lunch) is some damn fine china - especially for a \"fish and chips\" place.   I do think The Codfather would work better as a \"bar\" bar ONLY, or a fish & chips place ONLY, because there does seem to be a weird disconnect depending upon where you sit. The whole Sports-Game-on-TV-That-Doesn't-Match-The-Sound-(Music)-You-Hear thing that's common in a lot of places.   Based upon my experience and observations, I don't think The Codfather deserves so many negative reviews. Just doesn't describe The Codfather I went to.     Service: Acceptable/Good  Prices: Reasonable Environment: Will be better once the Olympics happen"}
{"text":"I just had the fish and chips to go.  Both tasted like they'd been fried in month-old grease.  Maybe I shouldn't have gotten it to go because by the time I got it home the fish was soggy.  The chips were obviously of the frozen Ore-Ida' prepackaged, card board type.  The smell was very unpleasant. This was actually two step below Long John's."}
{"text":"I was super stoked to find out that they had swordfish & chips!! great little restaurant!  Lots of English ales and pub favorites!"}
{"text":"Unlike other fish 'n chips places in the city, this one offers other British fare as well: bangers and mash, bubble and squeak, and more (see the menu board pic I posted). I ordered the small cod and small order of fries, plus a crab cake. The fries were cut a bit thicker than you would find at most fast food places (this does have the look of a fast food joint, except for the bar area). I had anticipated mediocre fries at most, having previously read some of the reviews here, but  the batch I got was quite good; crispy outside, moist and tender within. The same description could be applied to the fish - except that the battered cod was swimming in oil, and the fries were not. The crab cake was a good size - about the size of the palm of a hand - and just as thick, had lots of crab meat but also quite a bit of surimi (imitation crab) as an extender. That was OK, it still tasted good and I like surimi. Like the fish, though, it was drenched in oil. I'm thinking of coming back to try the other fare, or even the fish and crab cake again - they're tasty and not expensive. I just need to take the precaution of letting a paper napkin soak up much of the oil first."}
{"text":"This place has ruined french fries & basically anything fried for me. I had oil sitting in my mouth for hours after I left & I felt absolutely terrible. Food was not worth it. You can get the same kind of oily deep fried fish & better french fries from long john silvers for half of the price"}
{"text":"Customer service is very poor, they gave us our appetizer at the very end of our meal and I was a little concerned about the environment as well as the quality of staff I'm not too meticulous but I do like good customer service I give it one star."}
{"text":"Exceptional service from Amy and highly enjoyed every single bite.  Kudos to her homemade cheesecake and made us homemade whipped cream for our Irish coffee ! Chefs were awesome and every bite was delicious !Had half BAKED and half fried fish with multiple sides!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family on Friday. I had read the previous reviews and I was a bit apprehensive but my MIL really wanted wanted us all to have dinner here.   The area isn't great and the shopping center is older but tidy and orderly. They have two sections inside the restaurant, one for the bar (on the left) which was quite crowded and one for the restaurant (on the right) which was even more crowded :-P  We primarily came for the fish and chips. They have assorted fish (like haddock, cod, cat fish, shrimp, etc) for the fish and chips and you can either get two large pcs of fish with chips for about 10 bucks or the unlimited fish and chips for about 13 bucks (they obviously have other menu items than fish and chips, we just came for the fish). Two of us got the cod, one got the haddock and one got the shrimp, all with a side of chips.   I'm one of those weird people that has to eat each dish one by one so being a carboholic, I started on the fries. I speared two random fries on my plate, put it in my mouth and was immediately regretful. :-/ The two fries were soaked in grease/oil. It was nauseating and I almost called it quits with that bite but I didn't want to offend anybody by not eating so I kept on nibbling.  I'm so glad I kept going because the dish was AMAZING after that initial bite. The fish was light and not too greasy and the fries tasted fresh (they were slightly on the soft side but I'm weird and prefer them a little soft.) My husband had the same issue with his first bite of fries being soggy and the rest being great so all we can think is that maybe they were from the bottom of the fryer or something?   The place was PACKED by the time we got our entrees but the service was spot on. Our waiter was attentive and was knowledgeable on the menu and he even brought out some homemade sriracha sauce for us. My family members were all pretty happy with their dishes too :) (husband LOVED the shrimp!)  After dinner, we went shopping in their British \"mini mart\" (they have a small store in the restaurant, the size of a smallish closet) which was pretty fun, got to see a fun assortment of British food products and candy.   Fun experience, we will be back! But watch out for that first bite of fries ;-)"}
{"text":"great food great service great atmosphere.  Best Fish and chips out side of the UK. you cant go wrong eating here..."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times before they had full-service & now with the friendly service staff. Each time we've been there, food has always been the best.  I can also get my Horlicks malted milk from the little but well stocked UK products corner.  Our favorite is the Haddock and Cod fish & chips. Mushroom appetizer and the Clam Chowder."}
{"text":"First time and love it.  I lived in Europe for 6 years and this place reminded me of being back there.  If you would expect some high snotty joint then don't come here.  Cod was large and meaty, the fries crispy and you can taste the oil (and that's a good thing) but not greasy.  It's hard to explain,  especially if you've never been in England.  Judy was very attentive and knowledge of the menu. Will defiantly be back to try something else."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Cod Father for many years. At first it was just for the beer, but I ventured out and started trying the fish and chips combos. When they have it, I get the tilapia and chips. The breading is never too much and the fish is fresh-- it doesn't have that firm texture from being frozen. Plus, the tartar sauce is made daily or every other day, so it doesn't have that overly preserved flavor like some seafood chains. I don't care for the shepherd's pie, but the English Breakfast is filling and always delicious! It was a weekend entree that made its way into the weekdays. They have a small bodega that is stocked with novelties from across the pond. My favorite thing about this place is the atmosphere. The staff is personable and the restaurant doesn't ask too much from their guests. Show up hungry and leave happy."}
{"text":"The fish n chips where bloody lovely, the curry sauce and mushy peas are also just like from ole Blighty. If you want authentic British fish n chips I would highly recommend this place. They do all you can eat fish n chips on a Friday and Saturday if you are really hungry."}
{"text":"I tried, I really did. I tried to like this place. I've never been to England, and I'm afraid to go if the food is like this.   My sixth (or so ) visit to the Codfather was on Saturday for lunch. I had the large cod plate. As always, the food was way too oily. It really tastes the fish and chips were coeked in too old oil, at too low of a temperature. The breading on the fish is too thick and should use something, maybe even salt, to give some flavor."}
{"text":"Fish is very good and the chips are good if you don't get them to go. The bar area has a good selection of beers on tap (Kronenbourg being my favorite) The staff are friendly and the prices reasonable. As other reviewers have said - the decor is simple, and does remind me of Fish and Chip Shops back in England (I am an ex-pat) The grocery section has a decent selection and you can find some decent imported English foods"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in town by far. They have many other English/Scottish/Irish food options as well. Their beer selection is by far the best in Phoenix. Service is always good. If you don't like greasy food, don't order fried food, derr!"}
{"text":"This was my Foodie Friday stop with a friend yesterday. I was so excited to try this place. I haven't had good fish & chips since I visited England years ago and this place was recommended and I must say it's the best fish & chips I've had since I visited England. The batter was light, crispy and flaky. Delicious! I tried the scotch egg and it was ok. Kind of bland. Also tried the sausage roll. It wasn't what I expected and it wasn't bad but tasted more like stuffing than sausage. So I guess like a sausage stuffing. Lol!! All in all it was good and if return for the fish & chips alone but there are other British meals I'd love to try there."}
{"text":"Terrible. Had fish and chips all you can eat and it was dry and bland. When I didn't eat it and told the waitress she just shrugged and said that was too bad. So I went to another person who appeared to be the owner and she said it wasn't their fault I didn't like it and they wouldn't charge for the me regular price for the meal and continues charged me more for the all you can eat anyway. Rude service they don't give a sh"}
{"text":"I'm not even sure this establishment deserved one star. We went in for a late lunch and there were us and another table and after waiting an hour and watching others get food we asked where our food was and their explanation was that everything is made to order I guess my thought is unless the flew all the way to Boston and back to get the fish it's not even acceptable to wait that long. I'd hate to see what it looks like when it's full. And although we didn't get to try the food we were glad at the end because the people handling the food and the servers were dirty and they had  very little customer service. Highly recommend avoiding this place."}
{"text":"Divey kind of place for authentic standard English pub fare. Has my favorite English ciders and ales, which are hard to find in the desert. Fries are the homemade type, but not overly greasy. Fish is good, we had a fish and chips plate for $8.90 and were offered a couple of shrimp for a $1 more.. THAT didnt impress. The shrimps were ''shrimpy'', as in tiny and not tasty. Also shared the standard pub bangers and mash. Very good and like I had in London. The ambience, umm , not pubby. The bar, not great.. BUT its what you want when you want it. Staff was awesome, maybe a bit slow, (the lady ordered after us got the same thing and got her order about 10 min before we did).. Again, its a place for your yang for English fare and brew.."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes to have someone come over and get drinks and take our order. Once that was done did not see our waitress for 40 minutes until she brought the food out and at that time we got refill on water.   Got the haddock with chips and was a huge disappointment. There is absolutely no flavor in the fish and the vinegar is really light and no flavor and the chips are just the worst.   Really would not recommend if your looking for English food there are a lot of better places out there."}
{"text":"I want to thank Cassie,  for the first time in 10 yrs I came to the cod father and I really enjoyed the curry turkey pie. U must try it"}
{"text":"Take a trip to GB without leaving AZ!  If you are looking for the ambience of an English pub, you won't find it here. If you are looking for authentic English pub food, you WILL find it at Codfather's! (We've traveled to the UK many times and enjoyed traditional pub food a lot. I don't consider myself an authority, but I do feel comfortable making the claim that Codfather's is authentic). They even have a little area set aside selling authentic British candy, sauces, teas, biscuits, and more!   Of course, fish and chips is the first thing that comes to min when thinking pub food, and Codfather's does not disappoint. Cod, catfish, Mahi Mahi, salmon, haddock, halibut... grilled or fried? Small or large? One doesn't get that many options in the UK!! Plus, you get a side dish - how about mushy peas or baked beans? So British! Or perhaps you fancy meat: they offer pies, pasties, sausage, etc. And of course, you can get bangers and mash, or bubble and squeak,  or a ploughman's platter or even an English breakfast.   The portions sizes are very generous. The small fish and chips is big, the large order is bigger! But the ultimate deciding factor is taste. Again, no disappointment. The fish was fried perfectly, not greasy at all and the batter is delicious. The Cornish pasty was huge (half went home to enjoy the next day.)  The beer selection is awesome, too (some bottled, some on tap.) I've never found John Smith's Extra Smooth anywhere else in town!! In addition to the other UK beers (Boddington's Guinness, Fullers), they offer domestics such as Bud & Coors (why, I have no idea!!) as well as small selection of wine.  Service was great, prices are very reasonable and friendly/welcoming staff. Don't be deterred by the location - make your way to 16th & Bell, and enjoy great pub food at this family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"With a name like the cod father your cod fish and chips should be transcendent. Alas the batter was lacking flavor.  This place seems to be much more than just fish & Chips, it also doubles as a small English grocery and had many other brittish favourites.   For the price and bland flavor I would not give this a high reccomendation."}
{"text":"Love this place. The fish and chips are crispy and good. Love the Cornish pasty too. The bangers and mash really fill one up--I had to try the mushy peas and LOVED 'em!! The little grocery in the restaurant has lots of Brit staples too. Good beer selection. I'm glad they recently remodeled. The owners are very nice too.Next time I will try the Scotch eggs..."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar here last night.  The food is great, beer selection is awesome, and the staff is friendly. I met a couple of regulars too and even they were nice! I couldn't help but notice the whiskey selection wasn't bad either! I will return here the next time I want fish and chips for sure!"}
{"text":"Yes Yes yes Yes Yea Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes!!! Everything is just awesome! Staff, clientele, owner, food, drink, prices! Wish it were closer to my house but so good I make the twenty minute drive without complaint"}
{"text":"After running a few errands, decided to stop by on my way home. It's just a few blocks down, and was hoping to find a neat \"British Style\" pub. When I walked in, the bartender was very nice, and filled my Guinness order (nothing like a good pour!) I ordered the haddock per his recommendation.  As I was waiting, a very loud man was talking around the side of the bar. I was not really paying attention until he kept getting louder and louder, then said some disparaging comments about certain people in the current election. Now- I know tempers are running high this year, but I don't want to be sitting in a place listening to loud people make ignorant comments. I voiced my objections, and he told me to shut up and mind my own business. (I guess he goes there often)  He and the bartender then proceeded to talk about a certain gift store, and other places where you can get sex paraphernalia. My lunch arrived, and I ate as quickly as I could. It was hot, fresh and tasty.   I will probably not have any compelling reason to go back if this is the type of conversations that people feel are acceptable when there are female customers sitting by.  But hey- It's just \"Locker Room Talk\" right?"}
{"text":"Of all the places that I've eaten Fish and Chip in the USA this is by far the best.   The building and actual restaurant was disappointingly American looking despite the picture of the Queen and other UK inspired decoration. I wasn't that hopeful for the quality of the Fish and Chips.  Order was taken by an obvious Brit so my exceptions raised a bit. When the food came it looked just like you'd get in good old blighty. Portion size was good.   The fish came as it should in one piece with the batter lovely and crispy and the fish wonderfully moist and flaky. Chips were proper chunky chips not those horrible 'fries'   If I had one criticism of the place I'd say it was the decoration... its too 'Rule Britannia' maybe thats what Americans want/like but I think it would look better if they made it a bit more like a UK chippy i.e 'Cool Britannia'  Anyway this place is now in my address book for future visits!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try, this is very average to us but you might think different fish left an Itch in both our mouths....and we thought we might get sick but didn't, It was OK but not great from what we had,..I think if you are looking for British groceries this is fine...maybe the other foods they offer are better?....I don't know...we just wanted to try....but they were crowded....maybe they are normally better   As a slight update I think we had itchy throats from all the oil in the air....we aren't used to that...the air was itchy and we kept coughing.   The fried fish was tasty...we had cod and Maui Maui (the Maui Maui was sort of fishy tasting the cod was better) his fries were hot and fresh mine were old and cold. Thankx Guys!"}
{"text":"I see many mixed reviews for The Codfather but must say that for the dozen or so times that I've been in for lunch or dinner or both my wife and I have been in for dinner, we've truly enjoyed the food and service (usually served by Jordan since we eat at the bar).  We've tried pretty much everything on the menu and have found the fish and chips (especially haddock) to be moist, flaky and delicious every time ordered...which is every time for my wife. Sheppard's pie is large, juicy, piping hot with plenty of meat and mashed potatoes to satisfy and the pasties (meat pies) are always spot on.   The best part of the establishment is the selection of Irish and English beers on draft and/or bottles. They serve beers I've never seen on draught before anywhere, not even New York or the Princeton, NJ area which has numerous British Pubs and frequented in the past. I won't go into detail as to selection but if you're a fan of a nitro draft which is as smooth as silk when poured and enjoyed, this is the place to enjoy! Trust me on this one!  There's usually a game on one of the 3 TV's in the pub area and usually a few locals @ the bar to share a story or two but always seem to find new people to meet and enjoy a pint whenever stopping in. This is not an authentic English Pub but certainly has atmosphere and the food, drink and service to make you feel welcome. Mark and his family have done a great job bringing a slice of England to Phoenix with The Codfather. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic fish, shrimp, chicken strips. A little grease never hurt anyone, right ?  I go once a month. It's always a great experience."}
{"text":"Go for the food, not so much the service. Also, try not to go on a Friday or Saturday night. Seems to be understaffed. Fish and Chips were good."}
{"text":"We eat here a lot, and love the food!  No matter how busy the place is, the service is good and the staff is friendly.  Try the all you can eat cod on the weekends...you'll be busting at the seams when you leave!"}
{"text":"Talk about the most expensive uninspiring place! Apparently seasoning is not practiced in food preparation here and soggy fries constitute \"chips\". I thought the waitress was considering suicide and if I had to collect money from poor souls that I fed that to, I guess I would consider it as well. If you don't like your money and hate flavor, it's time to pack up the family and head to Codfathers."}
{"text":"Fish was pretty good. Fries were soggy, not sure if that is the \"English\" style. One of  my kids didn't like the chicken and fries on the kids meal, the other one liked the fish, not the chips. It was also hot in the restaurant, no A/C on. Cool atmosphere though. Server was friendly."}
{"text":"Just had some very tasty haddock with chips and mushy peas. Soul food for an ex pat Brit! Washed down with draft Union Jack IPA from California."}
{"text":"Fish and Chips.  Today, I was in the mood for seafood. A work associated  suggested I try \"The Codfather\". The reviews online for \"The Codfather\" are mixed however, I thought it was worth giving it a shot.  The Codfather is unpolished, and unpretentious.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and welcoming.  As I  sat muling over the menu I enjoyed listening to the random music being played.   The customer service at \"The Codfather\" is really good.  My  server was accommodating without being intrusive and  took the time to explain the menu.  I decided to try the fried cod and it was very good. The cod was fresh, crispy, and not greasy. The Cod combo comes in two sizes small and large. The small has one piece of cod for $7.50 with chips ( fries). The tarter sauce was amazing and I'm usually not a big fan of tater sauce  The service and food were all good. It might not be the best fish and chips I've had however I'm looking forward to.going back again."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar to grab a quick fish & chips and a draft. It's good. For fried food that's quick what can really go wrong? Have the right expectations when you walk in and enjoy a variety of fish and chips they have there."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with a couple of friends.  They seem to be big fans of this place.  2 of us ordered cod and chips and one ordered tilapia (he was not very pleased with the tilapia and vowed to stay with cod in the future)  They brought a bowl of complimentary potato chips to the table. I didn't time it but it seemed to me that it took a little too long for our order to come out.  I didn't think the food was particularly tasty, but the tartar sauce made it better, I also asked for some lemon I also think the food needed some salt, which may be good for those limiting their salt intake.  We asked for split checks and that was OK (nice of places suitable for lunch to be flexible with split checks), and  I almost missed to notice our server charged me for a drink when I had only water. They fixed it but it took a little while (probably over 5 minutes)  I won't probably come here on my own but if I the guys want to come over for lunch again, I will be back.  Oh, for beer fans, they seem to have a very good variety (about 60)"}
{"text":"This is a quaint little place for fish that gets super busy! It is adjacent to the N.Y. Barber shop in case you need a cut (It is the only place I go to for a buzz). The Codfather is all British based fare.   I had my first Cornish Pastry. They are like fat Pop Tarts loaded with your favorite goodies. They also call them Meat Pies. The menu is loaded with all of your favorite Fish and Chip conceptions and much, much more.  Being old school, you won't find Coke or Pepsi here. This is a throw back to the days of RC Cola. I hate to say this but every once in a while you have too. If you are pretentious, only eat in certain areas of town that qualify, you carry a dog in your purse or have a heated toilet seat, PLEASE stay away. We do not want you ruining the vibe...  The staff here are awesome and you feel like mom is getting ready to yank chow out from the oven at home. It is very comfortable and I had heard nothing but good reviews prior to my visit. Fish fans, give them a shot.   #irishcatv2 #vino2 #vino2ultimate #scottsdale #vinosquared #rebelfoodandwine #codfather"}
{"text":"I've lived near this place for almost 8 years and finally decided to give it a shot.  My husband and I both like fish and chips but he prefers super thick batter and I prefer mine to be thin so we never both like fish and chips from the same place.  This was a great compromise between both of our styles.  He liked the batter and I didn't find it overwhelming like I usually do when he likes it.  It was crisp and (shockingly) flavorful.  What I usually run into with fish batter is it tastes like nothing or it tastes like beer.  This stuff was good.  I got mashed potatoes with mine, my husband got fries.  Both were good.  I did not like the gravy that came with the mashed potatoes - it tasted like salt soup.  But the mashed potatoes didn't need gravy at all - they were great!  Service was friendly.  We were there at 2:30 in the afternoon and I was surprised by how busy it was at that time.  They do all you can eat fish and chips on Fridays and Saturdays - I might look into that next time. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Yuck. Grease infested grossness.  Really bad."}
{"text":"Just ate there for lunch today and it was... decent. The Cod was pretty good, but the fries were awful. I had better Fish & Chips at TGI Friday's last week. Truth."}
{"text":"This is a terrible restaurant. Over priced for what u get. Beans and slaw straight out of a container. Fish greasy. Not worth the money. Will not go back. Left hungry."}
{"text":"Cod bland--NO seasoning, and portion not generous (for the large cod--which means two small pieces). Ask for extra-crispy. Chips are just American fries, not the thick chunky hand-cut pieces you get in the UK.  Please, Codfather, consider salt!  Many imports they carrry are out of stock, no matter when you come. Pleasant atmosphere, nothing special."}
{"text":"I always found the cod to be greasy. Good but greasy.   Maybe I should try something else?"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for fish & chips in Phoenix. I wasn't sure what to expect my first visit, but their food is great! The fish is tasty and the service is friendly. I recommend this place to anyone looking for good English style fish & chips!"}
{"text":"This review is for the British grocery/snack section.  It's just a small assortment of candies, chips, condiments, etc, tucked into a corner near the register, but I was happy to find some favorites.  I got some Tango apple soda, which I love.  I also picked up a bottle of HP sauce for cheaper than it costs at my local grocery store's international section.  They have a few frozen items supplied by Cameron's British Foods like sausages and meat pies.  It was slightly cheaper for me to purchase those from the Codfather than directly from the mail order company, so that was nice too.  I'll be back now and then whenever I'm craving another Tango or other British snack.  Haven't eaten in the restaurant, so can't comment on that."}
{"text":"Have driven by this place a thousand times and recently had a customer tell me how good it was so we have been looking forward to trying it.  Unfortunately we are one and done.  It gets a star for having nice cold beer and a tremendous selection.  Like everything though it is a little pricey.  We got a jalapeno popper / fried zucchini  appetizer that was OK.  We also got two orders of the Cod and chips and were greatly disappointed.  The cod was greasy and not that flavorful.  I have had my share of bland meals in the UK on many trips but its usually fresh.  This was not.  After we ordered, I saw the chips on another customer's plate and knew we were in trouble.  They may have been the worst \"chips\" or fries I have ever had.  They were cold and must have been cooked hours before.  I have always said I would eat anything that is fried and that is no longer true.  Its sad when a tiny amount of effort isn't expended to make something worthwhile.  Is it really that hard to make some fresh fries when people order them?  There were only 3 tables of people in the place so it wasn't like they were overwhelmed.  The people were very nice but the food could not be eaten.  We both felt sick the rest of the night over the little bit we actually did force down.  The bill ended up being $50 before tip for one appetizer, 4 beers and two cod and chips.  Painful if its good.  Brutal when its not."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good fish and chips. The cod is prepared just the way it is in England. The chips (French fries) could be better, but this place is worth a stop for the fish."}
{"text":"My sister and brother I laws' favorite hang out - and now one of our favorite places! The Fish N Chips are amazing, the atmosphere is great a truly friendly staff. Looking for a simple and friendly pub with great food? Put this on your list to check out. You'll be glad you did! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Being from the UK it is not easy to find good English food here in Arizona. The Codfather got it right. The fish & chips and the steak & kidney pudding are really good. Great selection of beers & ciders. Very friendly staff. Reasonable prices. (If you don't believe me try Gordon Ramsey's pub in Vegas) Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Decent fish and chips- the all you can eat version was a pretty good deal.  My biggest issue is that I like for the breading to stay ON my fish. It was a bit on the bland and oily side even after I doused it in malt vinegar. Is British malt vinegar less potent than the US version? The tartar sauce did taste homemade though. Overall this is probably the second or third best fish and chips I've had in the valley. Love the Lego table for the kids to play at!"}
{"text":"Ordered the fish and chips and half of my order was just the shell of fried batter without any fish in it and the other half the fish just sat on top of some batter. Who ever is putting the flour on the fish is not doing it correctly. The fries had no salt although they were cooked well and the side of shrimp was very good though."}
{"text":"Looks really cool from the outside, but once you're inside it looks kind of run down and doesn't really live up to be 'hype'.   Was looking forward to a nice dinner sitting on some booths, but the only place to sit was just the regular chair and table, no \"comfortable dining\".   After a few minutes and drinks being served to us shortly(we were the only ones there) we weren't sure if we were suppose to order our food up front or wait until the waitress comes back.. We got there at 5:50pm which was perfect; 10 minutes before their special $5 fish n' chips were done. Unfortunately, the waitress didn't come back until we went and got her to make sure we made it in time for he special. At 6pm we gave her our order but she came back saying at 6pm on the dot the system shut her out of the fish n' ship special...   So I come all the way there for a special, I order at within the last minute because she took to long to come back over... And when push comes to shove they couldn't even override the price. So instead of paying $5.50 each for fish n' chips, I paid $10 EACH for my gf and I to eat. The waitress was slow and didn't even offer to edit the price..just simply stated... \"Sorry the system locked me out and we can't do the $5 special any more\".  I call that HORRIBLE customer service and a pathetic excuse for a business. I was there before 6pm and was not honored the $5 special. Luckily, i just wanted to eat and didn't want to stress over a huge confrontation.... but yes...I was PISSED.   THAT BEING SAID, the food was good. Atmosphere is not so good. Maybe if you want to go hit up the bar that's connected around the wall. That is if drinking alcohol with the stench of fish is more appealing than a real bar with a pool table and darts..."}
{"text":"Went for the first time and month ago. We didn't wait to long before the server took our order and then 15 minutes later discovered she had not turned in the order. Then piece of cod I was served was terrible, you could not cut it with a fork or knife. Never going back and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Love fish and chips - just not here.  The fish was cooked nicely but totally under seasoned.  My biggest complaint is the watered down vinegar.  If you are going to serve Sarsons in a Sarson container then it should be authentic and original."}
{"text":"Will make this short and sweet - nice peeps, ok food.  I have been on a seafood kick and I really wanted fish and chips. I happened to be on that side of town and saw this as I was driving past, remembering reading a review on  yelp a while back...tires screeching, I did my infamous U-Turn that's made hubcaps on my old '67 Mustang roll off onto the side of the road...luckily I now drive a car that doesn't lose hubcaps so easily. ;)  Stopped in and got fish & chips and some water. The water was good. :D  The fish and chips were ok. People have complained about the greasiness, but I'll be honest...if the fish and chips aren't greasy, I get worried. When I lived in the UK, fish and chips were always greasy.  The fish was nice - I got cod...I'd love to give their other stuff a shot when I am on that side of town again. I'd also like to bring along hubby since he's a discerning Brit. He can drink the beer and tell me if it's good or not. ;)"}

How this dump stays in business is beyond me  we paid our bill and left ....don't go !!!! NEVER ORDER CHOWDER THERE IT'S NOT"}
{"text":"Friday night dinner with family, had no expectations or idea it was a British bar and grill. I just expected to eat fish, but made the right choice to select the Sheppard pie! I did pick at the kids fish and chips, so fresh and not bready( goog thing)"}
{"text":"Horrible soggy batter and chips which taste nothing like the real thing.  For anybody who has not been to England this is not what real fish and chips taste like.  They are an embarrassment to us ex-pats who know they as passing this off as authentic English food.  They used to be much better but do not seem to care anymore."}
{"text":"Cod n fries. Looked great but after we were done we felt like we drank a pint of grease. Felt sick all night."}
{"text":"I went here thinking that this would be a wonderful place for fish and chips the fish was so soggy it was awful the only reason that I can think anyone would come here as for the beer"}
{"text":"We hit this place on a Saturday night around 8p. There is a restaurant side and a bar side that is divided in a very awkward way. Plus in the restaurant, it looks like it is counter service, but it was sit down service. I actually don't have a preference between the two  as long as the food is good. We have all had subpar food from a sit down place and great food for a counter place. My only point in bringing this up is that the whole layout of the place is just weird. It could really use a makeover.  Now getting to the food-I went with a small fried haddock, chips (i.e. Fries), and mushy peas. It has been a few years since I have been to England or Ireland so I can't make a good comparison as to what you would get over there. But I can say that I really enjoyed the food I got. The fish was nice and meaty, the batter was tasty, and the malt vinegar at the table had a nice zing to it that seems to be missing from the regular grocery store malt vinegar you can get here. My old lady had the beef sheppards pie.  Ironically, I thought the sheppards pie looked very nice, but tasted average, while the presentation on my fish and chips was not good but it tasted very nice. I would have liked for the fish to come in a basket, lined with paper, that sort of thing. Just to make it look like something they are proud to serve (which they absolutely should be-again, it was very good). With it being on a plate, it just kind of comes off as \"look-here's your damn fish\".  One other thing-the small portion is really a perfect size as the large is huge. Even though it was all fried food, I didn't feel like I was overloaded and would have my stomach angry at me.  They scored big points with me by having Murphy's on tap here, and it tasted great. For those of you not in the know, Murphy's is to the city of Cork, Ireland what Guinness is to the rest of Ireland. No, I can't say which is better because I have never tasted them side by side. But you can get Guinness on tap in a million places, and I have never seen Murphy's on tap outside of Ireland.  They do have the area of items you can buy. Many of them you could probably find in World Market, but I imagine not everything.  To sum up, I think they have the main things correct in the fish, chips and Murphy's. It would be great if they made some cosmetic changes to the restaurant and the presentation of the food. This place is nowhere close to where we live, but I am sure we will be back."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero star I would.   Ordered some crab cakes. They taste like salmon. I took 1 bite and sent them back to kitchen. Manager insisted that I pay half something I sent back.  He didn't care about the customer service of the horrible representation of food. He said there's nothing wrong with it. I had to pay. He surely didn't give half the dish back. Get a better cook and more friendly staff."}
{"text":"OMG, simple (wish it had any level of ambiance) But fantastic Fish and Chips.  Great neighborhood quality ole brit style.  Just roll in newspaper and I'm across the pond."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  It is a little pricey, but sometimes they have an all-you-can-eat fish and chips special for about $10 which is totally worth it.  The food is authentic, I haven't had fish and chips this good anywhere else in Phoenix (especially not at Pete's) the chips are cut thick, the fish is fresh and tastes hand battered, the fillets are whole. Plenty of tartar sauce and malt vinegar too.  If you're into beer, the place has a great selection of Euro brews. There's Soccer on the TVs, they sell all kinds of awesome Irish and Scottish and British foods, and they have some of the wildest flavors of Potato Crisps from England also.  The place is absolutely packed on Fridays, so expect a wait. They also close a bit early, like around 8pm typically. So plan your trip. It's worth the trouble."}
{"text":"The food was suprising delicious, I'd previously heard that British food was terrible. Anything that they fry has the best batter and the Scotch Egg w ordered was fantastic. We definitely plan on going again and trying more of the food."}
{"text":"My mother was British, so we always had to get Fish 'n Chips when I was growing up.  I wish we would have had this place around back then.    It's pretty decent Pub-style Fish and chips.  They have lots of good brews to go with it as well!  It's not close to my home, so I have to go out of my way to eat there...which is actually funny, since Oscar's Pier 83 is almost right across the street from me (they just aren't quite as good!)."}
{"text":"The chicken wings and haddock where so bland!! The waitress gave us poor service and messed my order up, I hate cod and she brought that out; and then took forever to give my husband his refund! We won't be recommending anyone here!!The best yeah right if you know flavor and your a fish lover like my husband and I!! If I could give The Codfather a half star I would.....For service and lack of flavor!!!!"}
{"text":"So I've gone here a few times in the past, but after my last experience...NEVER AGAIN!  What a jerk the owner is!  Since I would go in once in a while for the haddock and chips I figured I'd get their restaurants.com coupon where it is $10 off.  I go in with my girlfriend and show the coupon.  Immediately there is a problem.  I have used restaurant.com coupons dozens of times and there has never been an issue.  The manager talks to me and explains they don't allow the coupn on any items on the specials list and a bunch of other things they won't accept it on, limiting my selection to about three items.  None of which I like/want.  It doesn't say anything on the coupon about this and then the owner (the British dude) comes over and angrily expresses that they never wanted to be on that site and they are not honoring the coupon anymore.  I made the point in a calm manner that I've been a loyal customer and he says he doesn't care and won't accept the coupon.  Why not?  It is out there.  I purchased it.  Nothing on there says it is limited to certain items.  $10 is $10.  If he accepted it I would have spent plenty of money on that visit, plus future visits.  Never again will I give them my money.  I don't support jerks whose food is just average at best anyway.  Might be the only place to get haddock, but it isn't worth it.  PS-It isn't the only place to get Haddock in Phoenix.  Wanna know where?  Message me and I'll tell you."}
{"text":"To be fair, I have no other experience with most of the items on their menu to compare with. That aside, I have yet to taste something here I didn't love. The Cornish Pasty Co. may have more variety and an edge on pasties, but still no North valley location..."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get authentic English style fish and chips. They have other English specialties as well like bangers and mash, etc. They also have an English style pub so you can get a beer or cider to wash it all down."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal when it comes to authentic  fish and chips. The owners Mark and Ruth are wonderful.  If you come on the weekends they have all you can eat fish and chips for about $12.95..  the atmosphere  is casual dining with a built in bar attached. Try the scotch eggs as an appetizer. .so good. They also have a mini store featuring  English  goods."}
{"text":"A great food find my boyfriend and I stumbled upon  This place has the best fish n chips, very thick fish fillets, choice of fish for entree i felt so stuffed after just one fish. it was too good to deny myself another."}
{"text":"I have traveled the world, including UK.  It's rare to find a great fish and chips place stateside, but this qualifies.  The cod is fresh (I believe) and the batter crispy...douse with vinegar and salt...delish...I'll be back"}
{"text":"Good small English pub/dive bar. My hubby and I went there out of curiosity, and we had a good time there. Wasn't sure what we were expecting, and it wasn't a disappointment. So that's good news! Fish and chips are really good, and they have a good selection of beer. Most of the beer are irish...which I'm not complaining one bit :)"}
{"text":"Food is from England. Love the sausage rolls and you can buy em frozen to take home too!"}
{"text":"I swear, he looked a lot like Walter. Only the people there will know what I am talking about.  Popped my Codfather cherry last night.   Friendly staff and good service.  Enjoyed the Bangers and Mashed.  Well prepared, hot, and tasty. I will be back."}
{"text":"If you crave English pub style fish and chips, You will find it here.... Plenty of it, and in many varieties. They fry up cod, haddock, catfish, mahi mahi, and salmon as well as salmon or crab cakes.  I've tried the haddock.  It's very good fish, but hard to escape the gallons of oil.    They serve sausages of many types.  Saveloy and Bangers, Battered sausage on a stick.....   They have traditional side dishes, like mushy peas, bubble, cole slaw, pickled eggs and mashers.  They make scotch eggs, chicken curry, and several combination plate dinners as well.   They have pies, but not the kind of pies one would find in England.  These are the packaged \"fast food\" version from Australia.  They are good for mass produced pies, but not better than one would expect to pop out of the freezer.  Don't go to the Codfather for the pies.  Go for the fish and chips.   On Saturday and Sunday from 8am to noon, they serve a Full English Breakfast for $8.99.  This consists of eggs, both bacon AND sausage, either beans or a thick slice of fried tomato, bubble (the sort of veggies leftover from a roast dinner with cabbage fried up with potatoes), mushrooms, black pudding, and fried bread.  It isn't fancy...  The place is in a small strip mall and has large windows, fast food booths and tables, a TV on the side, and lots of magic market or painted posters hawking new treats or specials. If your comfort food is something British, you will find it here.... if not, go for the fish."}
{"text":"Saw this place referenced on my friend's FB wall.  We been searching for a place to get Fish n Chips, so we thought we would check it out.  Well, this is place is a very British inspired.  We ordered several items to try/share:  Sausage Roll, Scottish Egg, Fish n Chips and Shepherd's Pie and bread pudding w/custard.  Now, this was my first time trying Shepherd's pie, seen it a thousand times on TV food shows...this was not your ordinary creamed mash potatoes on top of the \"stew (sorry don't know how better to describe the ground meat and brown sauce)\".  The mashed potatoes were baked with a little crust of cheese and actually had small diced potatoes too, which gave a nice texture contrast.  The stew was well seasoned and very flavorful.  Also, the sausage roll had minced meat and seasoned well.  That, I would come back for...However, the Scottish egg was not as crispy as I would have liked but it was good.  Also, the Fish n Chips were a little on the greasy side and the chips (French fries) were very soggy, not fresh nor crispy.  Personally, I've never had bread pudding before and I'm not a big dessert person, but the bread pudding w/custard was good and tasty.  The dining area was clean and the service/waitress was good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here.  It does have a bar, that appears to be frequented by locals/regulars, which could be fun."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner last night, the fish and chips are awesome. Friday nights it's all you can eat for $10.95. My wife liked the small British store for treats and goodies. We definitely plan on being back."}
{"text":"OI!   This is great food. I have had several types of fish here, the cornish pastie, the bangers and mash ( excellent!), Scotch Eggs, and the English Breakfast, which is sadly, no longer with us.  The owners are Brits, and they explained that there were no fish n chip shops in Phoenix, so I, for one, am very glad they opened this place.  A fine selection of beers and british treats rounds out an awesome restaurant, in fact, the only reason they don't get a 5 is the lack of English Breakfast. I want my Blood Sausage, damnit!"}
{"text":"Never in this area. Used yelp and couldn't be more disappointed.  Has no one ever had real fresh food before? The crab was imitation crab and the fish and chips where just blah. Service was good but the food was horrible. Will not be back"}
{"text":"I have to start with an old UK Joke.   \"How did you find the steak and kidney pie? \"     \"I moved a chip...    The plusses. They have hard cider:) The chips are not those evil stringy jokes  that  pass for fast food places \"or the  crisp and crunchy variants they are pretty  close to decent home made chips  but  having grown up in the uk and eating this for  3-4 years during college   ( and they wonder why Scots have the most heart disease  outside of  New Orleans:))   this is  not just like home.       This is still very much  fish and chips at the \"sit down\"   rather than take out level. E.g   They are adequate but  didn't kick me back  nostalgia wise and  so far in the US I've not found decent ( aka bad:)  UK food that didn't come out of one or two suppliers  in the states and was lovingly heated to the same directions.   The steak and kidney pie, holy heck it was lame. I'm eating offal here so you have to give me some credit for knowing when the piss is being taken.   It's not an fully enclosed pie like they would serve in the UK which is finger food meant to be consumed on the move which doesn't describe this 80% crust to filling ratio at all.  This needs a fork, and  not that big a one cos three  trawls of the pieplate was all I  got out of it.  So far the only place that has gotten remotely  close to UK pastry  is the  Cornish pastie co in Tempe. Seriously this alone took it from 3 to 2 stars.If it cost $2 more but actually contained the advertised ingredients in identifiable lumps I'd be happier as it is less insulting  in the long run.   Nearly everyone else fakes it  and cooks a filling, then crust and marries them later  to heat. Having ketchup in packets is just bloody annoying, not having brown sauce out  likewise.       Hint  Cross the road. Go to the Indian grocery , to their freezer  section and get their steak and kidney pie /  steak pie /  any pie   , Go to Codfather for chips,  stick the two together."}
{"text":"so sadly mediocre i had to just take one star off. The food left me feeling disgusting afterwards.  Most fried foods do, but you know when there is more batter than fish, and oil than batter that your food isn't going to be good.   If i could go back in time i would have walked next door and gone to Spinatos nuff said.  there really isnt any type of PR at all going on. Infact you have to initiate everything. Go up to the counter and say what you want. Don't wait to be asked, don't ask what they like cause they wont really respond...but maybe they were giving me an honest answer cause i certainly didn't like anything here."}
{"text":"Honestly, this review is tricky to write, because I'm not really a big fan of British cuisine. I don't like fried fish, kidney pie, bangers, or much of anything beyond a good sausage roll (which they do quite well here). It's just not really my thing.  My Mom, however, who is about as British as tea and crumpets, gave her seal of approval after eating some of their shepherd's pie during a recent visit. Bangers and mash? Only so-so. Their custard-based desserts are also worth mentioning, as we've tried both the banana bread and more traditional pudding. Both are decent if that's your thing.  I can't speak for the pub-side, as I don't really like beer. What I can vouch for, however, is their selection of imported British goods. This is where my review gets more positive. There are various baking goods, cookies, and drinks. But the real gem is the vast selection of British chocolates. Anyone who knows chocolate will tell you that British chocolate, with its milk-base, is vastly superior to the sugar-based crap they sell here in the States. Since the recent Cadbury ban, finding some of our favorites isn't as easy as it once was. Thankfully, they keep an extensive selection of all of the good stuff - although I'm reluctant to reveal just what, for fear that everyone will go deplete their inventory.  If you like British food, it's definitely worth checking out. If you like English candy and your timing is right with their imported shipments, you've stumbled upon a chocolate lover's gold mine!  Recommended for the British goods and I suppose at least trying out the food."}
{"text":"Overpriced but really good fish! I had the cod sandwich. Service was so so. I will be back at some point in the future when I get a craving but it's too expensive but what you get to come regularly."}
{"text":"Great mini grocery for imported English canned and jarred goods, but the food is bland, tasteless MEH!  --great selection of beers on tap --happy hour drink specials until 7pm --fun little mini grocery for your english junk food favorites and jarred Hayward and Coleman's products. --no-frills, drop-ceiling triple-wide strip-mall joint. No apologies, just solid English food...  But the food is BLAND. Tasteless, flavorless, boring MEH. There is a gigantic salt shaker nearby and you're going to need it!!  ## shepherd's pie arrives in black rectangular plastic bin, straight from the microwave. Sent straight back. Come on!  Is English food supposed to be so uninteresting? Give me a seasoned and panko-dusted piece of any fish, any day of the week over this meh crap.  What a shame."}
{"text":"I myself don't like the food much but that's because I'm not a British food kind of person.My boyfriend on the other hand loves the cod fish and chips.He lived in London and this place reminds him of the food he ate in London and he says it's good.Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Before I say anything, I want to give the proprietors of this business mad props on the name.   Although they don't make an offer that I can't refuse, the name alone is tempting enough to give the place a try even though fried fish isn't really my thing.  It's fish and chips.  Greasy, oily, fried fish and french fries.   If that's what you're looking for, then this is the place for you.  If you're looking for some sort of classy cuisine because it's british, then Codfather is the wrong joint for you.  My girlfriend and her parents are from across the pond, and they love this little strip mall fast-food spot.  They say its the closet fish and chips in the valley to England.  I've never been to Europe, so I wouldn't know.  They're also big fans of the minimart Codfather has set up by the register.  It has a bunch of foods imported from the UK that you can't find anywhere else.  Codfather has a nice little variety of fish to bread and fry.  There's also a decent menu of british meals and fast-food meats.  A good selection of imported beer also makes for a nice dining experience.  On the night we dined at Codfather, they were hosting some sort of poker tournament.  I didn't ask what the deal was, but it looked like a lot of fun.  And if you didn't know it was a british restaurant just based on the menu, there's plenty of flags and soccer (oh, sorry, I guess that's football in here) on the TV."}
{"text":"Companion and I had lunch at this restaurant. This was our second visit, with our first having been about a year ago.   We were promptly seated and offered drinks. Unfortunately, their selection of non-sugared drinks is rather sparse and I ended up having tea with no lemon. Fortunately, being a \"British\" restaurant they have an idea of what tea should taste like and no harm done.  Companion and I started of with a Scotch egg. It was cooked nicely, and served cut into quarters to make our sharing easier. The egg is served with what I surmised to be Coleman's English Mustard, which I really enjoyed. Most Scotch eggs served in the U.S. are made with regular seasoned pork sausage, which is highly seasoned compared to English sausage, however this sausage was perfectly seasoned in the true English tradition.  Next came the main dishes. Companion ordered the Steak and Kidney Pie and I ordered Bangers and Mash.  While the Steak and Kidney Pie was but a shadow of the real thing one would get in any pub (even at a roadside on the M5) the flavor was acceptable, however the kidney was nothing but mince. The pie was more like a Cornish Pasty than a true baked small pie. The pie came with no accompaniments whereas in the U.K. it usually comes with a side of mash and some mushy peas.  My Bangers and Mash arrived and was nicely plated. Unfortunately, that was the only good thing about the dish. The Bangers, while nicely cooked were loaded with salt. I thought that perhaps one of them had received some extra seasoning during the creation process, but alas, taking a bite from the second one revealed the same extreme amount of salt. The mash was acceptable, and was made from Yukon Gold potatoes, but the peas, which we were told were brought in from Boston were shriveled and lacking flavor. This plate was inedible. Companion, who the doctor had just prescribe a much higher amount of salt in her diet ate some of the Bangers to comply with her doctor's wishes. Speaking for myself, I finished three large glasses of Iced Tea and later stopped at a local McDonald's for a large soft drink.  The bathroom was nice and clean and it appeared that the restaurant was also clean. Tables were bussed regularly and wiped down.  2 stars for cleanliness and pleasant service."}
{"text":"Aaaaah The worst! Our stomachs are sick !!! Had the worst fish & chips ever!!! It was so Disgustingly Greasy!!! The vinegar was watered down or something and did nothing help it!!! It was all you eat but I couldn't eat much! I did not even want their fries!!  My husband got the calamari which was all batter!!! And beef and onion pie which was mostly pastry with very little meat inside!! We almost tried the whole menu ! No happy! The staff was so nice that we did not have the heart to complain to her!! Will not go back!"}

{"text":"Literally the best fish and chips you will ever eat! And that the fish is all organic is just the cherry on top! Also they have a good selection of English beers that you can get a flight of"}
{"text":"Why are there two listings on Yelp for this place?  Ever since my trip to Europe last March 2008, I get a hankering for real beer-battered fish and chips now and then. This pairing is not complete in my mind until you serve it with a steaming hot side of mushy peas. As it would turn out, mushy peas are hard to come by here in the desert, but I am not one to give up so easily. (Rosie's, by the way, doesn't have this buttery little delicacy, reminiscent of Linda Blair on a particularly possessed and angry day.) To my sheer delight, The Codfather did not disappoint! Though just a bit mushier than I remember them being across the ocean, these mushy peas are seasoned well and have a nice buttery flavor.  There are a variety of fish on the menu for your liking. I had the 4 oz. portion of the traditional cod and found it to be more than enough, good flavor and good texture. It sat atop a modest portion of soggy chips in a plastic basket lined with wax paper and was served with a small serving of tartar sauce in a clear plastic bucket with a lid (cocktail sauce was an option too). My husband had the 7 oz. portion of sea bass served on a plate and I did not like it as much - it was a bit too soggy throughout. After tasting my cod, he said he wished he had ordered the same instead.  SAVING GRACES: Fun mementos throughout! The Union Flag, a photo of the Queen, Charles and Diana, a double decker bus, a sign for Picadilly Circus...The menu! Everything British, from Scottish Eggs to Cornish Pasties, Even the dessert is fried, so go elsewhere if you're recovering from your bypass surgery.  GRIPES: Greasy fish & chips difficult to eat in the small plastic basket - a plate would have been helpful. Need patience to squeeze out enough ketchup from the little packets on the tables. Being environmentally minded and too hungry to waste time tearing open 10 little ketchups, a refillable squeeze bottle would have been great. They use them for the hot sauce instead...a little misleading. Stingy serving of tartar sauce served with all portion sizes of fish. Extra sauces will cost you .25 cents each. More like a diner and less like a pub.  Imagine! A little taste of nostalgia only 5 minutes from my house. And at under $10, my husband is thrilled at the money we're saving now that I don't have to buy an international plane ticket in this economy.  If it's mushy peas you're looking for, you've come to the right place! If  you can do without, hit Rosie McCaffrey's for the best fish and chips in town with the ambience of an international pub."}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips. The plus is that they have a full bar so you can have a beer or whatever with your meal. TV in the bar also. Very authentic food. A must try if you like fish and chips."}

{"text":"Homey atmosphere, very good selection of beers with European selections. Okay customer service but high turnover but terrible food hygiene. Worst yet, denial by the owner that it couldn't possibly be theirs even when you see a young gentleman in the back with long hair (in his defense he was wearing a hairnet but the hair was in the batter). Absolutely zero address to the hair that was fried in with the fish to us. They did ask if I wanted another serving as I declined with a grimace but they still had the audacity to charge me full price. After I told them \"c'mon at least take off the fish, the owners disputed amongst themselves again of what to do, really loud so I can hear them as they look at me. Then the wife comes up to the register rings up a new check and leaves, again not a word, no apology. The new guy that's only been there two weeks tells me the new amount is 20% off excitedly yet NO APOLOGY! This place cannot afford to compensate fish much worse any apologies whatever happened to good ole customer service?   PS. My husband and I initially believed their denial \"it's not us we don't have long hair\" till the long hair dude came out he said he didn't have a hairnets at all at that time!"}

{"text":"Delicious!! Service was friendly and food was great. I had cod and chips! Superb!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Delicious. We got the mahi mahi fish & chips & can I just say wow! Super natural sweet fish taste where you could eat it without anything added. The potato crisps are delicious & so are there are chips!"}
{"text":"Why doesn't this place have a higher rating?? The fish and chips here are so delicious. This is how fish and chips is supposed to taste like. This place delivers consistently on quality and flavor. Sure, it's probably not great for you but who the eff cares when it tastes this good. I am from Seattle originally and this is the only place in the valley that satisfies that greasy delicious fish craving I get. Don't forget to try their other english food (the bangers and mash are also bomb) and look through some of their english food and treats that you can buy for home. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I ordered cod fish and chips to go and a scotch egg. I ate it pretty quickly from curbside though. Fries and egg were soggy and the fish breading was too. Cod was nice quality though, the egg was alright but I had never had such a thing before. Cute pub and what looks like a nice selection of brews."}
{"text":"Stopped in Saturday around 3, it wasn't busy at that time of day.  My husband and I both had fish & chip meal and ordered extra sides so we could try the slaw too.  The fish itself was good but the batter was a bit soggy and so there was a lot of grease between it and the fish.  It wasn't cooked quite long enough to get crispy but it was thoroughly cooked.  Slaw was good but watery, fries weren't salted.   Our waitress said it was her second day whenever we asked her menu questions, and wasn't very talkative or overly friendly.  I will probably try it again sometime.  $34 for two meals, two sides of slaw, and coke and one beer so reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Has always been fabulous and worthy for expat evaluations.. am hoping that tonight is not a norm snd that they get back to great fish n chips soon.  Service as always-exceptional."}
{"text":"Truly authentic English fish and chips - I was back in England two weeks ago, had Fish N Chips three times and The Codfather was better than two of them...  I LOVE the English breakfast they do at the weekend (but don't open until 10:00) as well as the homemade pies, pasties and sausage rolls... they also have an English store section in there for various English goodies and frozen food as well as a great bar section with a wide range of English / European beers both draft and bottled. Well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Being a Brit I know these are the real deal ,the haddock is my fave but everything I've tried there is good. Plenty of Brit foods well stocked bar and nice little Brit goodies shop inside. Saturdays is all you can eat cod & chips."}
{"text":"Newly decorated, awesome beer and cider line up and Fish and Chips. How can you go wrong?  This is by far some of the best fish and chips I have had in the valley, hands down. I am exposed to every fish fry and pizza joint in the valley as my husband is working through them all and I really like The CodFather.  I have tried the Fish and Chips and the onion rings here. I was not disappointed, the tarter sauce is tangy, the fish is hot and fresh. The batter is awesome. Have a pint of strongbow cider. Do it. It goes great with the meal.  I also think its really cool that they have a little store with all sorts of items from across the pond. Stuff you really wouldn't be exposed to here in America. I dig it.  Protip: They are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Everything was greasy and saturated with oil. They also charge $2 extra if you don't want your fish fried!!"}
{"text":"Cozy place with amazing food . Love the cod with mashed potatoes and gravy . They are to die for . We also had the rice and chicken curry and to our pleasant surprise they were delicious . We are going to be there every week !"}
{"text":"Great value.  Excellent cod.  Pretty good mahimahi."}
{"text":"Wow, I came on here to send a link about this place to a friend and was surprised to see so many neg reviews.  My family moved over here from Yorkshire, in the UK, when I was a kid and has been on the look out for good fish and chips ever since!  The Codfather is the first place in 25 years that passed muster.  My folks drive miles all the way from the East Valley to go to this place and I drive up from central Phoenix to join them.  Yorkshire could be considered the epicenter of the fish and chip addicted Brit and even gets riffed on for it.    The couple that own this place imported their fryer equipment and alot of their ingredients from the UK - they even have haddock on the menu which you NEVER see anywhere out here (haddock is a flaky north atlantic white fish that is superior to cod - do not get cod if you can have haddock instead).  As I read the neg reviews I realize most of them appear to be reviewing the type of food vs. the restaurant. Its like giving a bad review to an Indian restaurant if you don't like Indian food - not cool.  Yes, its a hole in the wall and the owner is a no-nonsense Londoner, and yes, NEWSFLASH: fried food is greasy!  But these are the best authentic British fish and chips you will get.  If you don't like that type of food, don't slam a (small, hard working, family run) restaurant thats doing a really good job at it.  Some educational tidbits for the uninitiated:  1.They serve chips not fries - chips are soft not crisp 2. Ask for/try HP sauce with it - thats what many Brits prefer over ketchup 3. Don't get it to go if you can avoid it- the heat of the food in the container continues to steam the food and its not as good (or the batter as crisp) when you get it home 4. In the Northern UK you primarily get haddock, in the south its mostly cod, which is greasier - try haddock if you've never had it. 5. The reason vinegar is typically applied to fish and chips is to cut the grease - give it a whirl"}
{"text":"My friend drove 30 miles one way to here she had fish & chips but she picked up sausage rolls chocolate for me as I am org from Scotland the chocolate was so stale she tried to get my money back which was 25.00 for the candy we sent them photos they gave her a hard time wanted the chocolate back she then drove 60 miles round trip I would not buy anything here there customer service is so bad"}
{"text":"The Codfather is my new neighborhood spot. I love this little place, and for many good reasons.  I'm huge on service, and am not afraid to indulge in food and beverage alone and therefore, I usually elect to sit at the bar most places. The Codfather is no exception.   Meet Jordan. He is always quick to greet me with a smile, and after my first visit he has remembered my drink order each time. Never an empty drink, and not just mine. This guy knows what he's doing behind his small, but always busy bar. Not long after my first sip, I'm greeted by Mark. Mark, owns the joint. You can usually find him chatting with, and greeting guests near the bar.   Great fish and chips. The jalapeno poppers are my favorite to snack on here, made in house, huge and cheesy! Killer happy hour with includes $2 domestic bottles and $1 off pints, which is a nice selection to choose from.   Great atmosphere, awesome service, good food, and nice price points. Not to mention a pretty cool eclectic group of regular guests. Overall, just a good spot. Keep it up Mark and Jordon!"}
{"text":"Yes I expected better because I've eaten here before.I actually predicted the outcome of the product based on the actions that occurred in the minutes that followed . A dark- haired lad, handsome with a chiseled face damn near broke his neck getting to the counter. He shoved a menu into my hands not saying a word. It made me feel awkward, like hurry up, order, and get out is how I took the vibe. For sure the end justified the means because the fish was soggy,the coating did not envelope the fish and a shake of salt would have been not just nice but required.I don't wish to hurt the young man's feelings but ,\"homeboy needs to put some love into his cooking\" I know I fry fish on a regular basis and the reason the coating didn't stay on is because of improper cooking oil temperature or varying the temperature of the cooking oil. This mistake is widely experienced by many amateur or part time cooks, but just the same I don't appreciate this blunder at 12.95 a plate. Normally when using my Visa after signing the restaurant's copy of the receipt the clerk offers me what is already mine, my copy of the receipt. Instead he threw mine in the circular file, was he making a prediction or did he know something I did not ? It helps to have a receipt when you have a complaint, does it not ? He didn't even ask me if I wanted the copy he just threw it away promptly. Hmmmm?  In addition I would add that the Codfather is a fish and chips restaurant, that's the specialty. Therefore chips should be a part of every regular order, instead you must choose between slaw, chips, etc. If the powers that be read my review the most important point I must stress to you all is put a competent cook behind that fryer, you can produce a good product you have for me in the past. Don't be freakin stingy with the chips, give them generously with every order then charge for other items on the side. Not trying to tell you how to run your business but we are the public , we are not stupid , we shop and we know how inexpensive potatoes are, you all \"feel me\". Your going to generate more revenue by word of mouth from people bragging on your quality and large helpings then omitting what you know we as customers are entitled to, for the purpose of saving money(overhead). This visit I did not get what I expected and I spent close to 60.00 at your establishment. I BELIEVE you need to make an adjustment you may not think so, in any case, to solve any differences, simply ask yourselves do you want my business or do you not want my business. Yelp submits this review to your restaurant and you have an opportunity to let me know where you stand on this issue, if and when you respond, but I'm not holding my breath."}
{"text":"we have been driving by this place for years but just stopped in for the first time.  Wow we really should have come sooner.  This place is great.  everything we ordered exceeded my expectations.  The menu is much bigger then I expected too.  Come here you will like it."}
{"text":"Great fish! It would be better if the chips were not fries but with it so hard to find a place that does good haddock and cod, I can't complain. Worth the drive from south Phoenix, a small taste of home in the middle of the desert. They even have a Brit shop too!"}
{"text":"One of the few places to get British style food in Phoenix. But don't count on it being that great."}
{"text":"Really liked it. Good place to eat. English style food. Bangers and mash were really good and the the onion rings are really good too!"}
{"text":"They no longer carry Guinness Draught. It has been replaced with Murphy's Irish Stout ($3/pint by the way). If ordering on the restaurant side, the cashiers are always underage, so they can never advise you on specialty beers available. Not a huge deal - but if you are stopping in for a pint, it's probably easier to sit on the bar side.   I also wish this place offered table service rather than ordering at the counter. Again, another reason to sit at the bar, I suppose.  Fish n chips still good!"}
{"text":"The crab bites appetizer is just the best!  Real king crab.  Some of the best draft beers too. And oh, fish and chips that are the best around and reasonable.  Nice friendly atmosphere.  We head there first when family come in from the east coast.  Their favorite too."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife and daughter for a late lunch on the 6th.   We have been itching to get some good fish and chips and this place fit the bill. I had been here before ages ago and remembered it as being very good. Luckily, my memory was good. This place was awesome!  My wife ordered the small fish and chips and I had the large, although I was tempted by the all you can eat deal they had at the time. Our daughter had chicken strips off the kids menu.  What we learned was that the small fish and chips is not enough! The food leaves you wanting more. The cod was well prepared and the batter was delicious. The fries were even good!  The chicken also looked very good. I didn't try any but my wife ate a piece the next day when we were snacking on leftovers. She said it was still incredibly delicious and would love to try it fresh next time.  Service was very good as well and the restrooms were the cleanest I've seen.   We can't wait to return."}
{"text":"We stopped because we loved the name ...really surprisingly good food and great service from Brianna we will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I have been dining at this restaurant for the last 3 years and keep going back.  Mark and Ruth are the owners and from England. 90% of their menu is homemade and authentic. They are personally involved in the day-to-day operations and work hard to take care of everyone.  I enjoy their hospitality and the way they try to engage with everyone and receive feedback to keep improving their restaurant.   I love and recommend their pies, my favorite being Steak and Kidney and Cheese and Onion. The pastry and filling is to die for. They have awesome Fish and Chips with the lightest and tastiest batter ever. There fries are homemade, but I would recommend you ask for them to be freshly cooked so you can appreciate the true flavor and taste, which really can be appreciated if you put salt and vinegar on them : ) They do specials all the time which is great so you can eat great homemade food from England. There is English breakfast on weekends and they just started serving Saveloy Sausage, which was so tasty.  Try their garlic onion rings and sauce as well, they are addictive.  They have a full bar with English beers and have a happy hour and a drink card to get a free drink after 9 paid (I think).  The décor is basic but does have English influence.  They have a gift shop corner where you can buy English supplies i.e. HP sauce, P.G. Tips, Walker crisps and lots of sweets.  There is a bit of staff turnover but Asia (Manager) has been there since they opened and is a sweetheart.  It really has become my local and I enjoy my time there every time I go."}
{"text":"I really want to give more than three stars, because my family loves this place.  However, the food is so greasy that I got ill once.  Great British beer selection and I love the football on the telly.  Owners are very friendly.  Even took me behind the bar to show the Guinness stout dispensing apparatus.    Not suggesting the food wasn't fresh and good.  It was.  And I have eaten here four or five times so it can be only so bad.  Just watch how much you consume if  a lot of grease doesn't sit well with you.  I believe they will broil your selection and that would resolve the problem."}
{"text":"I've always had mixed feeling about Codfather. It's an odd place. I've been coming here long before the quasi-pub went in, when it was more similar to a mom & pop version of Long John Silvers. Off the top of my head the absolute #1 thing to like Codfather is that they are NOT a me-too chain like Silvers.  Codfather never impressed me enough to rank them high on anything ... quality, price, atmosphere or service. Now after a couple of years I chose to return on one Friday night and despite the weirdly arranged \"new\" bar and dining area they still fail to wow me.  We ordered fish & chips to go. If you like your fish and fries mega-greasy (and some people love it that way) this is your nirvana. I wanted to tell my auto mechanic about this place as a major source of axle grease.  I grew up where Friday fish fries were a religion, always something dad would bring home on Fridays from some dingy little bar (he just stopped in just to get the food, honest) because in that part of the world no bar could exist unless they offered immense dirt-cheap all-you-can-eat and fantastically good fish fries to lure in the blue collar workers on payday. As a youth and traveling many places since then I know good fried fish.  I tried to verify the following but can't because Codfather's website menu isn't anything like the one in the restaurant, but (and I may have read it wrong) I thought I was ordering a FISH DINNER, you know with coleslaw and maybe another side but what is printed on my receipt is two orders of two cod fish at $10.20 each (just the fish, nothing else) and two orders of small chips at $2.75 each.  That's not what I expected.  I don't have much of a problem with each piece of fish costing about five bucks each, they were large pieces but $2.75 for soggy, undercooked, greasy fries is outrageous.  It's like they are purposely trying to piss their customers off.  The little service we had was okay. As mentioned above the ambience was weird, and at the height of dinner hour on a Friday night the place was half empty.  That's not a good sign.  The best I can muster for Codfather is that I still have mixed feeling about them but they certainly don't earn more than an average 3-stars."}
{"text":"As an Englishman who lives part time in the Valley, I was very impressed with the freshness and quality of the food. I had the large cod and chips with a side of curry sauce (Recommended) The batter was tender and crunchy and not too greasy and showed the chef had taken some care in the preparation. I visited with my wife and kids and they all commented on the food quality and cleaned there plates and commented it was like our chippy we used to use!  My only disappointment is that I have lived in Phoenix for the last 9 months and it has taken me this long to discover this place. I travel back to the UK every 6 weeks for work and it's nice I can find some food that reminds me of home when I come back."}
{"text":"I came here a while back with some friends to watch a game and even though it was decently filled w customers you could have sworn that they only had one server working. It took me an hour to get my food which was the wrong order. By the time I got my food my stomach was eating itself and I didn't have the energy to tell them it was wrong. Good food but I wish they hired more staff."}
{"text":"Way more greasy and less flavor than Long John Silver... $50 for 2 large orders of Cod and a kids meal. The fries are so greasy they are like eating mashed potatoes! We sat for 20min and received no drinks, and the kids meal that is supposed to come with a drink we had to remind the staff. Will not be coming back!! Greasy! Bland!! Over Priced!!!"}
{"text":"I am really stuck in the middle here with Codfathers.  Part of me loves this place.  They have football on the telly, marmite, and tons of good beers.  The other part of me hates it because of the greasy food and the STRANGE clam chowder.  I just don't know what to do.  I order the mahi and chips.  The fries were really boring and cold.  The fish was decent but really wasn't cooked all the way through.  I also ordered a bowl of clam chowder.  I was expecting something like Ivars and got some runny cioppino-like stew.  It was really bad until I salted the hell out of it.  Then, it got strangely addictive and I couldn't stop eating it.    Really weird.  I'd like to come back here but I don't think it's going to happen.  I'm sure my wife hated it."}
{"text":"Been here several times. Love the fish, tonight there was a little drama. Since when do you put bacon in a \"British\" authentic clam chowder.  My vegetarian friend asked to have a new dish which they did. But they would not comp it from his menu because it was listed in the menu. However it was not on the menu board where it was listed as a special. All they did was 10% off. My friend even asked if it has any meat base."}
{"text":"Our experience while ordering take out at The Codfather was very nice!  We had very good customer service.  Although our food did take awhile, we didn't mind because it was made fresh and was very tasty.  I recommend the Cod and Chips...with vinegar, salt, and lemon juice!  Very good!    The ambiance is balanced and this place has an amazing beer list...something that i'll definitely take advantage of the next time we pop in.    I enjoyed the little \"British\" shop near the register and while looking around the staff told us that if we didn't see what we wanted we could place an order and they would order it for us.  I thought that was very nice of her to do.  My boyfriend ended up placing an order for Jaffa Cakes, which aren't available in the USA.    Very cool place right near us and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent way to travel to Europe without leaving the states!  I love the beer selection and the fish is superb. The tartar sauce is definitely homemade ( I know because I asked) and the atmosphere is always friendly.  My UK friends love the food and now I know why.  Bangers and Mash? Squishy Peas? Mmmm. Sign me up."}
{"text":"The best fish and chips I've had so far! The fish is perfectly flaky, and the batter fried to a nice golden crisp. There's even a little store in the back where you can buy various imported English goods. Every time I step into Codfather's I feel as if I've been transported to England!"}
{"text":"Decent fish and chips that tasted much better once I dipped them in the tartar sauce.  This is where the real British and New Zealand people go so if you want a genuine fish and chips type experience this probably the place to go.  They also have a little mini grocery aisle with overseas stuff like Veggiemite and stuff.  I'm not a fan of the decor here- it looks like a fast food place inside.  Would be cool if they had more of an old time English/Irish pub thing going on.  Maybe for the Codfather Too."}
{"text":"As good as it gets. If you want REAL fish and chips this is the only place in the Valley that will get the job done. It was like being back in England ... First Class Sir!"}
{"text":"Again, I'm a sucker for a cute name. And thank God that this one paid off with also having amazing food. We stumbled upon this place by accident, but I seeing it on the side of the road as we are driving past. Like I said I could not pass up on a name like this. Staff was relatively friendly but kind of hands off. Batter on the fish could not have been crispier and later and did not leave a greasy feel around your mouth. My boyfriend basically inhaled his meal to where he got a second one to go that's kind of our true test of The place is worth returning"}
{"text":"My husband is British and was craving fish n' chips.  There are English/Irish fish n' chips (battered)  and American (breaded) fish n' chips.  Codfathers has battered, and my husband was SO happy.    The venue is kinda funky in a strip mall with the foam tiled ceiling like a doctor's/ business office, and just 'conference or cafeteria style' chairs,  but the service was fine.  We just really wanted to like it.   There is a bar area to the side which we will likely dine in the next time to avoid families with babies etc.   There was no dripping grease others have spoke of.  Bland?  Um, it is ENGLISH/ UK food- and is expected to be doused with vinegar and salt.  White fish and batter is not by itself a super flavorful meal.  It's the texture you are going for and then the salt and vinegar on top adds the flavor.    If you want American/breaded fish- go elsewhere.  This is the real deal for people who like European Fish n' chips.    I had the mushroom/chicken pie which was actually more of a pastie.  I expected a dish with a pastry top (shepard's pie edition-ish)  and instead got a 'hot pocket' style pastie.  It was tasty, but too much pastry and not enough filling for me.  George and Dragon's is better and more to my liking as it's in a dish with the pastry only on top.     Overall, a positive experience.  My husband so often complains about fish 'n chips he orders being done in 'old oil' or 'over done' or 'under done'... tonight he just kept saying, \"This is SO GOOD\".  :)  We will go back."}
{"text":"Best fish in town, reminds me of the old pubs back east. Ice cold beer with great service. Good location for the older crowd very, peaceful setting and very quaint."}
{"text":"Great fish & chips... Very very pricey for what u get!  Unless you go on friday... but the Halibut is crazy expensive... One piece for 11 bucks... ??? Yeah...."}
{"text":"My first trip I would've given it a 3. The fish and chips were good but the batter kept falling off. But we went two more times and each time it was better.  There are plenty of types of fish to have. The drinks were fair and tasty. And the atmosphere is nice. A few more trips and I may change my review to a 5. I'm not sure if the place is just getting that much better. Or if our first visit was a bit of an off day."}
{"text":"English is ironically an inadequate language to describe how wonderful this British pub is. I have eaten almost everything this chippie offers and it has always been great. The fish is outstandingly fresh, crispy, and perfectly cooked. Even the Steak and Kidney Pie, though humble, should not be missed.  Apparently there is some kind of \"football\" tournament going on now that has people excited and they all rather fancy watching it here. If kicking back a cold one while watching men kick a ball sounds like fun, then this is definitely your place.  Also, don't forget to visit their \"expat shop\" as I like to call it -- a section devoted to all of the tasty treats from across the pond.  I never knew the joy of a dolly mix until I found all of their sweets."}
{"text":"We go here once every few months.  The beer is great and they have a good selection.  The decor seems to struggle to find itself, but if the food is really good, who cares what it looks like.  They have added table service, which was not so great, but the beer was good, so......  Always get the cod fish and chips.  It all seems to cost more than it should, but I don't mind if I am supporting a local business.  The only thing I will remember is to face away from the kitchen space, because you can see everything they are doing in there, it's a bit unnerving and I don't care for having to ask for a key to the restroom."}
{"text":"Enjoyable experience on the pub side with a few pints of Fuller's London Pride.  Several British ales to choose from, and plenty of friendly smiles from the staff.  Many patrons from other countries here, and I found myself in the minority as far as accents go - to my ears at least.  May try food on next visit.  Unlike so many places these days, the pub here has some character and it is ideal for making it one's regular spot for a pint."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Love the chicken curry.  A bot slow on take out but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The service was very good and clean place the cod was delicious not over done or grazing which is good I would definitely go back again"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend for lunch on a weekday on a whim after driving by. When we walked in the place was totally empty and we almost turned around but decided to try it. Service was ok, but pretty slow considering we were the only people in the place for over half of our stay. We both ordered fish and chips and were very disappointed. The fish was extremely greasy and the chips tasted raw. Maybe it would have been passable if it was a 3 dollar meal, but it was very expensive.  The entire experience was very awkward as well considering the place was empty for lunch on a weekday. On top of that, the owners (I think?) of the place came out about halfway through our lunch and started discussing business between themselves at one of the dining tables. Is there no better place for that?"}
{"text":"Food was a 4 Decor was a 3 Music on Tuesday 4.5  Hey, I stopped by this authentic British Fish N Chips joint last night and was surprised that I could not find a spot near the restaurant  entrance to park at the parking lot was full and this was a small strip center on Bell road with retail and service stores that were all closed. The place was relatively full for a Tuesday night at 7PM...more on that.  Since I felt like having authentic \"Fish and Chips\" the very nice lady behind the counter says \"What kind of fish\"? They have traditional Cod and Halibut and Salmon and Corvina. Plus Shrimp and Scallops and a lot more.Well in as much as I have been trying to minimize the fried foods in my life, I felt that I was down a Quart of Oil....so what the heck. Hey I just ran the 1/2 marathon last week, so go for it.   Had a piece of cod and the scallops as well and an order of onion rings. I must say, I was impressed with the fish and scallops. Very crispy cod and a nice portion as well. I had 10 scallops ($6.00) which are scallops and nothing else but for $6.00. Pretty good.  Was not impressed with the miniscule serving of tartar sauce and it's $.25 extra per serving (about a tablespoon). Well I must admit I like a little fish with my Tartar sauce. Don't get me wrong, I was impressed with the flavor of the food. I guess I just had too much oil. Maybe that's why I did not like the onion rings as much. They were good but by now, I reached my limit of oil.Again, fish is expensive and these portions were very nice.  Here's the biggest surprise and would have given The Codfather another 1/2 star if Yelp allowed half stars which I guess they don't. It's open mike Tuesday and there was a pretty decent band playing. 4 pieces; Banjo, bass, 2 guitars. After a few sets, a duet with a gal and guitar and a guy playing a mandolin were next. Pretty good, gave the place a nice buzz, people were listening and it was an added bonus to my Tuesday meal.   Finally....Thursday night these Brits open it up to an Irish Band (Raic) and I'm going to go...for some food and music. A very nice surprise in N. Phoenix. They might get to 4 stars soon.   all the best"}
{"text":"We visited this place when it first opened. We love fish and we're expecting a fabulous meal. All we smelled was grease when we walked in, and everything was greasy. So disappointed. We waited five years, noticed it was still open, must be good, so we went back. We had the same exact experience. I don't know why people continue to go here to eat. It's a shame because we could really use a good fish house in town."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed that I have to write such a poor review for this place.  I'm not a big fan of fish, but I love it when it's all fried up and served with fries, so I wasn't worried about coming here.  When we walked in, I was a little confused at the setup, but it kind of grew on me.  It was very clearly a mom and pop style place, and I can definitely appreciate that.  The decor was pretty awful, but endearing at the same time.  I'm not sure why they were trying to cover up their wood tabletops with awful cheap tablecloths, but to each their own.  I also liked their impressive selection of British foodstuffs.  I wasn't too hungry, so I ordered the smaller portion of the cod and chips.  I really liked that they gave you the option to order a little less.  Maybe I was under the wrong impression that this should be a faster service restaurant because you order at a counter and pay at the counter, but our food took forever to get out to us.  The unfortunate things was seeing the cook put our fries onto our plate well before the fish made it.  That left us with lukewarm fries.  The fries, well, they sucked.  They weren't the crispy kind and they weren't salted at all.  The fish, I hate to say it, was disgusting.  It was over-battered and wasn't cooked long enough.  That left me with a nasty mess of mush all over my fish.  I had to scrape it all of to be edible.  Since this place calls themselves the Codfather, and I wasn't pleased with what is supposedly their specialty, I certainly don't see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Ugh, I hate having to write this review because I've followed this family run business for 14 years. I've been a loyal customer since they were in Fountain Hills and as a fellow ex-pat it was a lovely reminder of home. Wow has it deteriorated. We went for take out tonight, drove approx 15 miles round trip, ordered 2 points of lager as we waited and bought from the British store in the back. Total bill was $86 and for that we got some bags of chips/crisps, black pudding, hot cross buns ($39!!!!) and then 2 large(!) portions of haddock and chips... when we got them home the portion of chips was yet again TINY and way overcooked, if not re-cooked. Awful.  Dark brown. As for the staff... We have been coming here for years and every time they act like they don't know us, no welcome from Mark, the owner, who's always sitting and drinking at the bar and complaining how much he hates it and wants to be on a beach in Mexico. I've watched Jordan, their son, grow up and he used to be a friendly face behind the bar but I never see him anymore. Judy is simply awesome, works her ass off every time we see her and unending smiles and friendliness. A few weeks ago I saw the Bar Rescue team in there filming some initial shots and I thought, wow... it's just as bad as it can get. Maybe Jon Taffer can improve the standards, ambience, owners attitude, portions and prices but I'm not sure. We're sick of giving our loyalty and money to an ungrateful owner with no standards or consistency."}
{"text":"They don't care about customer satisfaction one bit! The atmosphere is very unsavory. Brightly lit, hot inside. The seats and tables look like lunchroom seating. There is a good old boys bar on the side, it's just weird. My whole family went there and the wait is longer than usual for food and the crab cakes are very gross. This was when I developed a problem with this place. I took a bite of the crab cake and it tasted like corn bread mixed with canned cat food, not a speck of crab to be found. I'm not sure how they can call it a crab cake and charge $8 for it. I told the waitress I wasn't happy with it and she was nice and said ok. We received the bill and  the uneaten crab cake charge was on it. I requested that the charge be removed and overheard her conversation with the owner. He said, \"That's the way we make 'em and that's her problem if she doesn't like 'em!\" They offered 10% off. I can't imagine anyone liking them as they were not even crab cakes which taste like they have crab in them. The cod was okay and I might have come back here if they had done the right thing. The management needs a lesson on customer service. We spent 50 dollars here and I left upset."}
