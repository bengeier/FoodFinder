{"text":"Quaint little local cafe! I had the Dirty London latte (earl grey + espresso latte) and it was fragrant and good! The boyfriend had the espresso ice blended drink, and it was delicious! They also have sweets (eg. Cookies and cakes) and even quiche and empanadas! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband came here shortly after they opened up. Nicely designed signs and packaging usually sell me. The contents could be utter horsecrap, but I'm mesmerized by good looks. Fortunately, this place doesn't sell horse dung in a cup. Rather, they serve quite the opposite and we became regulars.   I'm a self-professed coffee expert. Self-professed, meaning I probably don't know much but, without sounding too pretentious, I've tasted coffee in Italy and France. Alright, that was pretentious. Name dropping countries is shameful and has nothing to do with what I'm going to say because really I'm not about to compare European coffee to a coffee shop in Ontario.  Anyway, the coffee was great. I get the French-press coffee, empanada and quinoa salad if I'm staying in. Its nice to have such a quaint, hip, coffee/espresso place in Stouffville. And the owner and employees are so disgustingly friendly that I want to take them home with me."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere to hang out, read a book, pop onto your mobile phone, computer, tablet kick back and have one of their hot drinks and a Dufflets (Excellent by the way) pastries. Friendly service, quality coffee, overall not bad.  Jim"}
{"text":"One of the best coffee places I've tried. If you want real coffee and geniune coffee art, this is probably the cafe to go. I would reccommended the americano for the coffee lovers. Also, it doesn't hurt that the place is stunning. I highly recommend this place.  P.s. the boss is super friendly and his daughter is adorable"}
{"text":"A good judge for latte art is when the art stays at the bottom of the cup when the coffee is finished.  This place did that while having one of the best tasting cappuccino in GTA, rich body and full of aroma.  Worth the drive to Stouffville, just make sure give yourself enough time to enjoy one here AND get one to go!"}
{"text":"A hip, friendly, charming little cafe, located on the Main St. of Stouffville.  Who knew such a gem would exist north of the downtown core of Toronto?  Simple, red and white urban decor, with big windows, perfectly warmed by the Spring sunshine.  The place is not big at all, with only two handfuls of chairs/tables but its cozy.  Their menu is written on chalkboards, with lots of good looking sweets in the pastry fridge.  You know you're at an awesome cafe when they have \"French Press\" coffee on the menu--not a lot of places have that.  We ordered 1 French Press coffee and 1 latte, for here.  Stunningly poured latte art, in shape of a leaf, it was one damn good latte.  Strong espresso with hints of nuttiness (no bitterness at all) and frothed milk at the perfect temperature.  Beauty in a cup!    The Medium roast coffee took its plunge and it was DELICIOUS and velvety smooth.  You can even slightly see the coffee oil, the magic of the French Press, that's where all the flavours are!  A perfect morning at the Red Bulb accompanied by extremely friendly staff.  I'm sure when the weather gets better, the hustle and bustle is going to kick in at the already busy cafe.  I'm sure it'll be my most frequently visited spot."}
{"text":"Adore the Red Bulb. Excellent coffee, stylish decor, and terrific ownership. Love this local business and what they stand for."}
{"text":"First time visiting here. Ordered a white mocha latte which was beautifully designed. Latte was very good. Also ordered a ginger cookie and a oatmeal cranberry cookie. Both cookies were very hard and cold. I even hurt my finger trying to break a piece of cookie off. Wish they would warm up the cookies."}
{"text":"And here I was thinking Markham was really getting hip. Where is my espresso bar, Markham? This place could have a magic wormhole and be in both King West  and in Stouffville at the same time, that's how hip it is.   We came here just after horseback riding at an equestrian centre for the first time since our girlhoods (which, let me say, are certainly not over). We were frozen solid and slightly saddlesore. I heroically balked at the idea of going to a Tim Horton's, since I had heard that Stouffville might be giving Markham a run for its independent coffeeshop money.   Just like in Markham, driving down 'the Happenin Strip' takes about 5 minutes so we circled back like disbelieving bird watchers having laid eyes on a rare and unexpected specimen. Did that sign say Espresso Bar? C'est impossible!   ATMOSPHERE  How it curdles my hometown Markham insides to say that in look and feel it is just like Toronto, just as hip, indie and slick. Rectangular and narrow, sunny, mismatched furniture, hip text art mixed in with historic photo prints on the walls. Random amusing hip items for sale. Buddha salt and pepper shaker? Check. Lunchbox shaped ironically like a sandwich? Check. Curse you, Stouffville.  FOOD  Having just paid out to sit on a bored horse for nearly two hours, the Cat wallet was feeling light, but what? Empenadas? Macerons? Cleverly wrapped homemade muffins? Couldn't resist. This may sound snotty but I haven't had a maceron since Paris (shut up) and gosh darn it they were pretty darn delicious. Four minis to share and we all agreed on the supremacy of the pistachio and strawberry. My cappucino was delish with lots of flavour and not too much milk.   The selection of food varied from sandwiches and empenadas to tasty treats like biscotti and cookies, which was a pleasant surprise. And the prices were not atrocious!  SERVICE  Absolutely nothing to complain about here. They were very nice and everything was made to order.  LOCATION  Stouffville's main drag, east of the Lion and the new hockey rink, on the North side. Parking in the rear and a back entrance.  OVERALL  Come with your friends for a triple A rated coffee and to get a taste of what life could be like living on King while living in your parent's basement i.e.  the housing situation in Toronto continues to be horrible.   Great food, great vibe, independent business, come out and show em some love.   Then come back to Markham. Because we still have Paintlounge and Rawlicious, Stouffville! We're watching you."}
{"text":"This place has been my favourite coffee shop since the first time I tried it in 2015. Brought my parent from overseas here and they also love it, more than the regular chain coffee shop. We always go for caramel latte. Tried the Cafe Bombon, but love the Caramel Latte more."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Great atmosphere, great coffee and food selection. You can really tell that the owners have a true passion for real coffee. It is the kind of place that feels really quaint and charming and adds to the ambiance of a town that has no Starbucks.   The only problem is the place is very small but that is really only going to be a problem if you are planning on trying to find a place to sit during peak hours.   Overall its the perfect addition to Main Street."}
{"text":"I'm not a coffee drinker myself, but I simply love their hot chocolate, pastries, and salty empanada.  Until my next visit!"}
{"text":"Place is average, bikers occupy it 24/7  I really wanted to like it but the service is as bland as their coffee, no personal touch, just another Starbucks"}
{"text":"I loved this place, great lattes with cute latte art, cosy. It is hard to find an amazing independent coffee shop in these regions. However, their customer service is sub par, actually it is atrocious.  After buying a latte, and bag of espresso beans, I sat down to drink my latte, and get a bit of studying done. I was asked to leave after being there only a short while (45 mins). I was just getting ready to order another drink, and hadn't been there for an hour yet, but was told they were too busy and needed my table. I am appauled at their customer service, and was deeply embarrased by the way I was treated. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Red bulb skinny vanilla lattes and the banana chocolate chip loaf are my fav ! Great service everyone who works there is super friendly and learns your order quickly and makes you feel at home :)"}
{"text":"Best beans/Americano I've ever had...seriously. I wish it was open later in the day but they are open super early 7 days a week so you can't ask for too much from a privately owned coffee shop.   I never take my coffee black, but I can drink it black here because of how amazing the quality is. I haven't tried their speciality drinks but they look bomb, and the kids hot chocolate has marshmallows in it which I thought was really cute. Starbucks tastes like toxic sludge in comparison to Red Bulb. But seriously.....   If it is a bit out of your way, it is well worth the drive. I'm going to buy their bagged espresso beans so I can have it anytime of day. Unreal."}
{"text":"I have only had coffee and espresso from this place, so I can only comment on that, and not the food, but if you live in the east Markham/Stouffville area and like coffee you want to come here.  I will be honest, I regularly drink timmies/McDs/Starbucks without complaining... it is what it is, but I only use pour over or French press at home. Red Bulb is a great alternative to the usual uptown coffee shops that you find, and they carry (and serve) Social Responsibility beans, which is a local coffee roasting place operating out of Richmond Hill. I would dare to say that they are the Intelligentsia of Toronto (Social Coffee and Tea, not Red Bulb - I'm just giving Red Bulb major props for serving and carrying their product :)"}
{"text":"It's an indie cafe that's well thought through. There is a variety of snacks and drinks to choose from. Their service is excellent. I felt right at home the moment I step in. The owner is a friendly chap. You can read his story in the website.  I have tried their tea, french press coffee and their espresso. Although I am not a coffee drinker, I can tell their espresso and coffee is much better than the Starbuck's."}
{"text":"Great relaxing place for morning coffee run. Very neat designs and the coffee is Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great to see independent coffee shops in the suburbs, however the offerings were not as impressive as the idea itself. Food options were limited  and did not seem fresh. The coffee itself was good, however. They need some more space; take advantage of the space in the suburbs and expand."}
{"text":"Here is to outstanding local cappuccino that I don't have to make myself. The \"downtown\" Stouffville food scene has gotten dramatically better in the last couple of years and the Red Bulb is a big part of it. I'm a stick to the basics coffee guy so cannot comment on the flavored coffees that come and go but if you are looking for the best cappuccino not whipped up in your own kitchen, just drop by here for your local fill of java. If only they had a drive through..."}
{"text":"Who cares that Stouffville doesn't have a Starbucks... you're better off at Red Bulb instead. Delicious lattes, very friendly chatty staff. Had a chocolate oatmeal cookie and it was great - not too sweet. Not a lot of tables so you may need to take it to go if you go when it's busy."}
{"text":"This cafe is pretty amazing. Its away from the busy Toronto area and its quite quiet to have a chat with friends, and enjoy a relaxing evening. I would go back again and again..."}
{"text":"easily the best espresso i've tried north of toronto. That includes thornhill, vaughan, markham, and anything above. I sometimes drive south to get my te aros, darkhorses, and sam jameses but red bulb is around the same level and its a much more pleasant drive from richmond hill.  got this recommendation from a stouffville email I got from Yelp. The majority of excellent reviews are spot on."}
{"text":"The extremely convincing reviews written by other yelp coffee aficionado's encouraged me to make the trek here last week after an early breakfast. Unfortunately and totally unplanned my breakfast spot plied me with about 5 cups of Joe before I could say uncle, so trying the 'bean' at Red Bulb is still on my to do list.  That being said I still wanted to go for a visit and the promise of free Wifi and a hip HIP coffee spot semi-close to home had me excited. Arriving on Main street in Stouffville I quickly found street parking (which was silly because RB has a parking lot around back - I know for next time).   Walking in I was warmly greeted by the staff and the decor of this spot impressed me right off the bat. A trendy sophisticated looking counter, back splash and display of pearl white and fire engine red was bright and beautiful and provided an amazing contrast with the more traditional older looking furniture (and the older building the cafe is situated within).  Being 5 cups of Joe deep I decided on a cup of their loose leaf green tea to calm myself before I began working. On the counter as you order they have small jars of the tea for you to smell and pick you fav - I love it when shops do this.  I had the pleasure of speaking to both of the owners during my stay and I learned quite a lot about this place that I found amazing.   Did you know ...  ...the espresso blend they use is unique only to them, no one else has this exact flavor! ...they work exclusively with a local (Richmond Hill) award winning roaster and pick up freshly roasted beans weekly ...the Roaster is named Social Coffee and Tea Co (2012 SCAA Roasters Choice 1st place winner)  If these stats were not enough to entice me to come back (repeatedly) I learned that they have a house specialty drink called Café Bombon. It is an Asian inspired espresso based drink flavoured with condensed milk.  I am more than a little excited to venture back to work my way through their coffee menu. Good things are certainly brewing in Whitchurch-Stouffville."}
{"text":"Best coffee shop in Stouffville and they have the awards to prove it."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee! Nice staff! Only complaint would be I wish they accepted visa. Some sort of stamp reward card would also be an incentive to continue going back. So happy to have this coffee shop in Stouffville."}
{"text":"best  caramel coffee frozen iced drink evaaaaaaaaaahh!! :)    the barista guy or owner idk.. if he was the owner but the asian guy was suppppppppppppeer nice!! he offered me a different choice of drink that's not on the menu just to try it and mix it up  anddddddd oh my god ! i'm in love with it! it taste better than starbucks frappuccino!!  yuuuuummyy! :) i am coming back for sure !! thank you for the tastyy drink"}
{"text":"I love going to Red Bulb! it's always so friendly and such a light atmosphere. the drinks are well made and the food as well. The portions are a bit small, but for the price it makes sense. Great for a small lunch or big snack :)"}
{"text":"A great local establishment for either a quick coffee on the run, or a leisurely Americano on a sunny day.  Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"My favourite coffee shop in Stouffville. It's a little local coffee shop with super friendly staff and drinks. I've tried a lot of different drinks but my favorite is still their matcha ginger latte. I don't like any sweet drinks (I usually have my coffee black) so I asked them to put less syrup in there. My sister had their cold drinks as well and she said it's even better than the Starbucks frap.   Always my favorite place to go in the morning (since it's so close to the Go-Train station) :)"}
{"text":"5:30 am?!?  Red Bulb Espresso has found a 5:30 am!!   I'm sure most of you Red Bulbs are just getting to sleep by that time.  Maybe there is a need for such EARLY hours in Stouffville only locals know about.  This Espresso Bar is such a rare spectacle it can even make neighbouring hoods jealous that it doesn't have an Indie Coffee Shop.  The closest one I'm aware of is next door to Richmond Hill Performing Arts Centre.   Red Bulb 3.5'd.  Stepping inside it has an aura that makes it more noticeably Downtown Toronto Indie Coffee Shops. The Flashy Design, the Indie style Floor Plan, the Branding, the Outside Sourced Bakery Goods, the Social brand Espresso/Coffee Beans, the Friendly Baristas, etc...  Holiday Season obviously brings on the likes of Gingerbread and Eggnog flavours.  The Cappuccino I had was enjoyable while not too bold however it doesn't have much aftertaste if any.  I'm sure I'll be back sometime soon.   Btw, it's located nearby the GO Train stop and Moksha Yoga Stouffville."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee. Rivals the best spots in Toronto heck Paris and London (I have been). My usual drink is a large Americano done with 4 shots always fantastic with perfect crema.  They only buy small batches of coffee from a local roaster called Social to ensure freshness. Free WiFi and seating. They have food but I have never tried."}
{"text":"Delicious Americano with no bitter after taste.  For the sweet tooth definitely try the cafe bon bon"}
{"text":"Came in after a long Saturday morning walk, looking for an iced coffee of some sort on an abnormally warm fall day.  The interior is fairly narrow with limited tables, but clean and welcoming.  The guy taking my order I'm guessing was the owner and was very friendly and offered some shortbread samples.  Their only cold option was an Americano, which was excellent.  I'd like to come back and try some of their hot coffees - this place has the potential to be a 5 star if I like their coffee - I tried it once at an event and was quite impressed, so I'll be back and update when I get a chance!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Jennifer K. for her awesome 4* reviews which brings me to trying out this hidden gem in stouffville. This small little shop is on Main St. Stouffville with limited parking spaces available in the back. It was tough trying to get my coffee.   I ordered the French Roast & Americano... smells so fragrant and strong, taste so delicious with an after taste. After drinking coffee from here, u don't ever wanna go back to Tim Horton's and/or Starbucks... total different level...  Love the interior design. Its small and feels homey...there are a few tables inside and 1-2 outside..  I also ordered the almond biscotti which fitted very well with my French Roast coffeee...its like a perfect marriage =)  I'm definitely coming back as soon as I'm in the hood... thankfully I live less than 10 mins away so its quality coffee at my fingertips... woohoo..!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee! Sandwiches so-so. Chai banana smoothie is wonderful. Will be back !"}
{"text":"My friend knows the best spots...... I wanted a coffee shop that wasn't Starbucks and Tim Hortons and she drove me up to the Red Bulb... she said that they have the best coffee.. and I was about to order a speciality christmas latte when.....  **JUGS OF APPLE CIDER ALONG THE TOP SHELF!!!!*  SOLD!  Everywhere I search for apple cider, I am given apple juice with cinnamon or spices of some sort.. I was told this was the authentic stuff. Yes I was super excited and maybe I over hyped myself up for this because in fact - this cup of \"apple cider\" really did not taste much different than apple juice, which left me sadly surprised and scratching my head in my mind.  THe decor was cute and they had some nice baked goods from dufflets, along with some savoury selections. There are a few chairs closer to the front where you can enjoy direct sunlight on a nice day or in the back with wooden banquettes, chairs and home decor magazines for your leisure.   Definitely would come back for the coffee if I had the time to drive up here... good little gem :)"}
{"text":"Just moved in to stouffville. Discover the local shop in town. The coffee and the place is not bad. Hopefully can try the food next time."}
{"text":"I came here on my way to visit my friend's new baby on a Saturday morning. this little cafe totally reminds me of the local coffee shops i used to frequent in downtown Toronto back in the days before I moved out to the suburbs... i love this little gem!! It's not a very big space, but it's cosy, with some tables and chairs for small groups to meet.   They do have a vareity of options for breakfast and lunch. The espresso and coffee menu is also quite diverse. I ordered a caffe latte and a scone and muffin. the green tea white chocolate scone was delish! it had hints of those flavours and the scone was soft and fluffy. the bluberry bran muffin was also another great item to try on the menu. They have sandwiches, yogurts and cookies available as well.  The latte was really well done. I enjoyed every sip of that cup! I also like how they do a bit of latte art on their drinks (yes even for take out ones) and i'ts just a nice little touch. They also have a variety of milk options for those who can't drink regular milk (lactose free, almond, coconut,soy) - their prices are also quite reasonable and not super expensive. I bought their espresso coffee home - 1 bag is 15 dollars, again cost is quite reasonable and they do roast their own coffee (another perk coz i love buying local coffees to use at home).  This place is not too far from home, so def. expect me to be back on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"So we were driving past and I needed something (not Star***ks, not Tim H****n's, not a chain) but we were in the sticks..hmm...then I remembered seeing the cute, funky signage and we stopped there. The very patient barista waited while I babbled (incoherently, half asleep) and I ended up w a tasty Earl Grey Almond milk Latte and a FANTASTIC matcha, white chocolate scone (trust me, totally not a white or milk chocolate fan). Almost didn't get the scone, but am all about anything matcha. SO glad I did. Not too sweet, tastes like it's made with quality ingredients. Latte I added a tiny bit of cinnamon and it was great. Quite pleased, would go back."}
{"text":"Red Bulb is the best coffee experience I've found North of Toronto. They serve beans from local Toronto roaster, Social Coffee Company. I had their Espresso and enjoyed it.  I think that they could have dialled it a little better, but it was a holiday so I'll cut the baristas a little slack.  Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop. Nice to get a cool refreshing drink while walking down Main Street Stouffville. Patio tables available outside. Service was quick and friendly. One thing that really turned me off though were the bunches of flies that were making themselves at home inside the coffee shop."}
{"text":"Having become a recent Stouffvillian, I was really quite sad that I was going to be lacking in any sort of great coffee companies - until I discovered both Social Coffee Company and Red Bulb Espresso Bar.  Turns out, they work closely together - as in they work with Social Coffee (I think Kris might have mentioned that already).    ANYWAY, it's absolutely music to my ears when I can be a \"OMG girl\" and order a great latte and curl up in a corner and read for a couple hours in somewhere near home.  I've so far tried their Americano, which is rich in flavour just straight up, their matcha latte which is essentially a guilty pleasure I have b/c it's like drinking a green tea ice cream, and finally, their mocha latte - another guilty pleasure of mine.  While the matcha latte was a bit too creamy for my liking, I've been happy so far with this place.  I did try a butter tart and a cookie and I must say that their pastries are...lacking.  However, I've a huge critic of butter tarts and so far, nothing has beaten Sweet Oven in Barrie.  But hey...that's like, an hour away.     I will definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"very cute! and right around the corner. Wish it was ever so slightly roomier for a stroller and maybe more varieties of sandwiches. But great coffee and service!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit here at this small dainty coffee shop. There's few street parking at the front of the shop and some at the back. The menu wasn't very big but it still provides a variety of selections to choose from including the special drinks where you can't find it elsewhere.   I ordered a small size of Dirty Earl Grey latte on their Spring menu and the flourless Blondie from the pastries selections.  The Dirty Earl Grey Latte was very aromatic. I never had earl Grey with expresso before so it was interesting to see what it taste like.   I was skeptical about getting the flourless blondie but that's the only pastry that really caught my eyes on. I took the recommendations by one of the staff and I was glad I tried it. It was definitely not as chocolatey than a normal brownie is but there were still huge chunks of chocolate pairing with some pecan bites. It seems like a small piece size but the pastry was fairly dense and it's just right for a quick morning munch and snack.   I definitely will be coming back again to try out more of their specialty drinks!"}
{"text":"Second time going. Definitely try their regular latte or espresso first to taste the flavour of their bean. I tried their regular latte and its flavourful; made perfectly. Second time I tried the autumn spice latte, and OMG it taste even better. I enjoy the mix of the chai, cinnamon and ginger bread syrup with its espresso shot! Very good!"}
{"text":"My 1st visit.  Small cozy cafe.  Friendly service.  Love their Autumn Pumpkin latte!!  Banana chocolate coffee cake was a bit too sweet for my taste.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was cute.  I really enjoyed the snacks that they offered.  Latte was good milk wasn't too frothy either :)  just wish the espresso was a bit more prominent.  Great latte art and excellent service."}
{"text":"Some days when I get on the train to work, I'm seated across a lady who is always holding a paper cup with the words \"Red Bulb\" on it. On those days, I would think to myself, \"Huh. Somewhere along this train line north of Mount Joy there is probably a nice coffee shop I should go find that serves this coffee.\"  For a quick coffee to catch up with a friend, Red Bulb is a clean, bright and sunny cafe. We had 2 cappuccinos and sat down inside on an upcycled church pew and wooden chairs. They have a small display of local artisan goods for sale, as well as a large community board for people to post up local events, services, and workshops.  *Not baby-stroller friendly, not wheelchair accessible*"}
{"text":"A must go very cute little coffee/tea/hot chocolate chilled out place."}
{"text":"I have been searching for independent Espresso bar or Coffeehouse in the Markham area and with no success.... All Markham has are Starbucks and Second Cup.. oh and God forbidden those Tim Hortons popping up everywhere!   Red Bulb Espresso Bar though not in Markham but only 10 minutes or so drive North... and it is a lovely addition to the Stouffville neighbourhood.   The interior of Red Bulb is nicely decorated... bright and airy with a lot of little decorations on the wall (needlepoint crafts, wondering if the owners got them from garage sales!)   The Seasonal Gingerbread Latte is delicious! :) Just like drinking my dessert which my friend probably thinks it is just so not right for a real espresso bar experience.   OK! I am green with envy!! I want one of this espresso bar in Markham!! I want to be able to get a good latte at 5:30 AM (damn this people are hardworking)! I want to able to chill out and surf the Internet with a good cup of Joe!   For now on, I guess the only option is to hop in my car with my laptop and drive myself up to Red Bulb!"}
{"text":"Looooove this coffee shop. This place has been in Stouffville for a long time. They have very unique coffee beans. Coffees and lattes are delish. Staff are friendly"}
