{"text":"Excellent customer service! The guy served with a smile the entire time and didn't rush. Love the food! Great job on the fresh orange juice"}
{"text":"The bad: Seated for about 15 -20 minutes without asking for our drink order.  Finally take our order and another 15 min goes by without getting any of our drinks.  The waiter proceeded to say that he was busy when 3/4 of the restaurant was empty and we could see that 3 waiters were just standing around.  The food finally came and although the portions were big the food was not good.  I had eggs Benedict, the hollandaise sauce was terrible. Overall the service was horrendous which was the biggest turn off, if the service was better this review might be slightly different.   The good: The meat lovers platter had good bacon and sausage. The homes fries for all meals were good.   Would not return."}

{"text":"Today my husband and I decided to try a new breakfast spot. Every time we drive by I'm like I really want to go to this spot. We already have two breakfast spots that we love, so today was the day to see if the restaurant compare. Cute little cozy spot when you walk in, servers and management was nice and very attentive. We ordered hazelnut coffee which was delicious. Thinking we are putting cream in our coffee, it was actually milk. So when you go to Exalta, they will give you a bowl with 1% (which is a blue/white cup) and 10% (which is a brown/white cup). Just remember 1% is the milk and 10% is the cream. If you're a coffee drinker like us, trust me it makes a different. So we finally got to opening our menus. The first thing we see is chicken and waffles. Now being from the south, I love some chicken and waffles. The picture in the menu was the classic chicken wings and a waffle. So my husband and I excited, decided to order the same dish with a side of scrambled eggs, mines with cheddar cheese of course and my husband plain eggs.   Now after we ordered our food, not before we ordered the manager mentioned that the chicken isn't the same but didn't go into too much detail.  Man oh man, once our plates came out was he right. Our chicken definitely wasn't the classic chicken wings, it was more like chicken tenders. Honestly not even close chicken tenders. We had syrup and sour cream with an orange on top of the sour cream (yuck. I first want to know who eats sour cream with chicken and waffles? Anybody?  That was weird to me but whatever. So we dig in as I went for the eggs first and my husband C/W. My eggs were delicious as my husband was stating the C/W wasn't good. I was like are you sure thinking he was exaggerating, as I finished my eggs and proceeded to the C/W. Ummm well my husband was definitely right. The chicken tasted more like steak fries than chicken, the waffle was dry and coming apart. I don't think they put egg or flour in their waffle. Probably just a waffle mix you where you just add water.   I tried my best to eat what was suppose to taste like chicken, even tried it with ketchup. Now pause  who puts ketchup on their chicken and waffle? Exactly! Proves, my point that it just wasn't good. My husband eggs were dry and for some reason his didn't taste like mines. Maybe he needed cheese. Cheese makes everything better (yum) We ended up not eating the rest of our food and just asked for the check.   Now even though the C/W wasn't good we did say we would try it one more time. Exalta does have a good variety of food and maybe it was just that order. After paying for our food the manager came over and asked how did we like the C/W. He wanted honest answers and if anyone knows me that's all I can do is be honest. I had to let him know that the chicken taste more like steak fries, waffle dry and not what I'm use too. He mentioned that they had the chicken wings in the back (which is what I prefer) and was trying different chicken. He said they use to order the chicken wings more but customers didn't like the bone (who are these customers) so next week they are going for the chicken breast which to me would be even better. He was very nice and gave myself and husband 20% discount cards which add up to 40%. Thanks! We will give it one more try."}
{"text":"Came here looking for breakfast knowing that they replaced giggling tomatoes so we gave it a shot.  The decor of the restaurant is nice and clean and looks like it has gone from a a major upgrade from the restaurant before.  The food is reasonably priced and portions are pretty reasonable to. I got the meat lovers platter and a pancake for $2 more. It tasted very well but the home fries were actually really good. Sad to say they didn't have any hash browns but the home fries made up for it.   The pancake itself got me kinda of skeptical due to just being 1 pancake but i liked it very much. There was a kinda of a chew when you bite into it but I really liked that kind of texture.  Overall I enjoyed my meal. There are many different options available that I may try next visit"}
{"text":"This place is Amazing! for Breakfast or Lunch! Clean, Stylish Decor, and the Newspaper is at the counter if you want to read while you eat. Great selection, and Very Good Quality food. I got the Pancakes which had fresh strawberries and blueberries with whipped cream. Each table comes with a sealed decanter of water,and the service was prompt and friendly with cool jazz playing on the speakers.  This is the CLASSY type of place you would find on Queen Street in Downtown Toronto!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is my usual spot for breakfast before work. Great deal on the early bird special. Food is decent as well."}
{"text":"Went for my first time and last time for lunch. Restaurant needs to rebrand their menu. Misleading meal titles with disappointing food. Box rice and pan seared chicken does not scream chicken souvlaki for me. Over priced for terrible food. Stick to breakfast I mentioned my dissatisfaction to the waitress and was left with a sorry and full bill No thanks!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the previous great reviews people have given to this place. Tried this for the first time and let's just say, I'll never come back! Understaffed, even though friendly not very attentive to our needs. That the only reason for 2 stars.   Here's a brief description of our experience. Got seated quickly. Took roughly 10-15min before a server acknowledged us for anything. Took a good 10min just for drinks to be received. A little longer for a cup of coffee because the milk sitting at our table (now room temperature) was bad. A good 30min for our meals to arrive. The hollandaise sauce on my eggs Benedict was more mayo than hollandaise. Gawd awful. No more details are needed I don't think. If this doesn't convince you, then I'll let you be disappointed for yourself. I think you'll have better breakfast at A&W! Lol"}
{"text":"I went to exalta in brampton for a typical sunday breakfast; the food and service were excellent. Our server was Pauline and she truly deserves a 5-stars alone as her service and attention are superb, she was on top of her tables and she knew the menu from top to bottom. The food was overall good and as expected for a breakfast joint but the service made the experience worth it. Keep up the good job and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place on a whim instead of getting a boring fast food breakfast.  The service was good and there are a lot of menu items to pick from. I got the meat lover's breakfast and it was a lot of food. It did take a bit longer to come out, but it was fine.  Price is reasonable compared to other places like this such as Eggsmart."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast on a chilly and rainy day and I felt very warm and welcomed the moment I walked in greeted by their friendly waiting staff. The ambience is modern, with pleasant music in the background that makes you feel you are in a 5 star coffee shop. I had eggs with some chicken  and fries which was just the kind of breakfast that whet my appetite on this Saturday morning and it was paired with an excellent cup of coffee. Vinayak, the restaurant manager and his staff took good care of me and ensured I had a memorable breakfast. I shall definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"First time trying this place..terrible service! We were seated quickly and the waitress was friendly but that was where the good experience ended.."}
{"text":"The place looks OK, but I could not try the food as service was so slow, we were seated for 20mins and no one came to our table to take the order or to even offer drinks (sunday breakfast at 9am), when i approached the staff I was told that they were too busy!!!, so we had to leave without eating."}
{"text":"Oce we were seated, we were basically ignored by the whole wait staff for half an hour - no water no anything. Finally, someone started to come over, but a waitress waved her away. When the waitress came over, she said she would help us even though we weren't in her section (thanks, i guess?) When the food came, it was mediocre. The eggs were strangely crumbly, the watermellon flaccid, but the home fries were tasty. Meanwhile, the table next to us, which ordered soon after we ordered, waited 30 minutes for food, only to be told the waffles would take an additional 20 minutes. I was never offered a refill on coffee and we had to get up to ask for the cheque. When we got it, the waitress told us to ask for her by name! As if she had done us tremendous favours when she had only given us the most basic of service. We will not be back (and no I don't know if the table next to us ever actually got to eat)"}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated.... great breakfast portions... dinners are now open and menu looks good.  PRICES ARE AMAZING HERE"}
{"text":"Went today with my sister for breakfast. The food was okay.. French toast was bland tasting, toast was overdone. The restaurant itself is very nice & the price was great for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"My sister and I went here on a spontaneous brunch. The food was pretty decent, nothing outstanding, but for the price point it's a good, quick eat. Service was friendly and the interior was lovely. It's a nice little spot to go to for a quiet lunch or breakfast. It wasn't too busy, and the food gets to your table relatively quick after ordering."}
{"text":"Decided to try a breakfast place and came here. Honestly the place is so elegant to start with and the service is amazing. Our waitress' name was Paulina and she was amazing. Also, the food was amazing I ordered a classic burger and my girlfriend ordered avocado breakfast plate and both were delicious. Definitely coming again. Had an amazing time!"}
