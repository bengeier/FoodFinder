{"text":"Zero service. The staff appeared to have collapsed under a small rush at lunch. After a while they took our orders, however the wait staff never returned with food or even water for the table.  Perhaps the food would have been good, but the front of the house totally flopped."}
{"text":"Perfect lunch place! Lunch specials, starts with soup and finish with desserts & coffee.  Very well located, resonnable portions, traditional Indian delicious food and very welcoming staff."}
{"text":"Twice I have been here, and twice everything was good. I ordered their plates for one and two people. It was good and spicy. I will return to this place"}
{"text":"Les plats sont bons, mais le service le midi était assez long et les portions n'étaient pas très copieuses. Il y a un autre indien en face au même prix qui sert des portions plus généreuses... La dame ne parle que anglais (et hindi) il me semble Déco un peu quétaine ms qui fait assez typique Bref, j'aurai bien mis 3,5, mais je trouve que 4 serait top.."}
{"text":"Came in for a lunch time special - menu run with 6.5-10$ options. The restaurant was quite empty with 2-3 customers the whole time I was there. The special includes soup, desert and coffee (but I was never offered or served coffee). The small soup portion was lemony and refreshing. My lamb curry was great (served with rice). The Gulab Jamun for desert was ok. Service was not very lively, but was pretty quick. A good bargain for 10$ (tip included)."}
{"text":"The food here was great!  A lot of options on the menu (some might even say overwhelming) but everything we got was delicious.  Went with the Chicken Curry, Bombay Aloo, and Dall.  Their Naan is delicious!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I was kept waiting in an empty restaurant for over 10 minutes while the only server on the floor was on the phone. He kept motioning that he would just be a minute. So I waited and waited and waited and waited while he mumbled a conversation into the phone. Then he couldn't figure out how to use the credit card machine. Then he handed me my take out order which had been sitting on the counter for more longer than the eternity I'd been waiting for him to get off the phone. Taste = mediocre. Portions = small. Nothing as depressing as opening up a takeout container and it looking half empty. Butter chicken had 8 small chunks. Rice very small. Rice people! Rice! Fill the take out container, God damn it! It's RICE! You cheap b@#&*@&s! Will not be back again."}
{"text":"A quick prawn patia delicously spicy and fragrant and a lamb malabar, orange and almondy and saucy.  Not bad, we forsook the rice and just took the protein with a cheetah beer and a glass of red.  Dark, quiet and A-OK with pleasant service.  I wish the lamb had been more cooked, like for a few days, tasty but not melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"I'm not sure when this restaurant was established but I have seen only a handful of reviews on this location. This restaurant is little bit more farther from the city's busiest area but the location is much more peaceful and calm.  I have been craving for the South Indian food from quite a long time and I wanted to check this place out to see if they have any. I walked in at 11:00 am and as expected the restaurant was completely empty. I saw the menu at the door and went ahead. Though there was no South Indian food, I made my mind to try out the biryani.   I asked the lady owner how the biryani was made, she told me it's made the authentic way (cooking it using steam) but once I have been served, I clearly see that it's not made the authentic way, it's merely just a mixture of chicken curry into the rice with some dry fruits. Such dish is called as a pulav, not biryani. No wonder she is not Indian, the restaurant is ran by the Bangladeshi's.   But, I surely did had some delightful conversation with the woman. I enjoyed whatever food was served. The restaurant was beautifully decorated with several art pieces and collectibles, aquarium and chandeliers.   No doubt, This place would look absolutely stunning at night. I recommend this place if you would like to try out the North Indian food, but I don't guarantee the authenticity.   Whatever they served, the so called biryani was not bad. It was good. So, I wouldn't doubt the other dishes if you were able to get this dish right. -SH"}
