{"text":"Zaytoon is dope! Love havin this in the area now."}
{"text":"They have changed the Pita bread and I don't think it is good. They used to make it fresh on the grill, but now they use store bought already made. 
To bad."}
{"text":"When you first walk in, the place is clean.  The customer service is 5 Star.  I was craving Gyros and some kabobs.  I have been eating Kronos Gyros since I was 5 years old.  The meat was dry, very dry and it did NOT taste like Kronos.  It seams the gyros was on the cone for a while before it was cut.  I tried the ground beef kabob and there was no flavor and the texture was nothing to write home about.  I will give them another chance and go back at lunch time.  I will update if any changes."}
{"text":"First time there and I will be back! Food was excellent. Had the hummus, gyro and fries. Must go to restaurant. Prices were great as well, not over inflated."}
{"text":"Gone way down recently. Sunday night 6:30, tried to order takeout on the phone, they said machine down cant order, call back in a few minutes. So I called 5 more times while I drove there. On the 5th call I finally got through, same response machine broke. So I show up and order ( only 3 workers two cooks and a very young cashier). So he writes order on scrap of paper (why couldn't he do this over the phone) and asks if I can pay in cash ( cause the machine is down) so now I am waiting, what do I do, write this review. 

My 3rd visit here in 2014 the other 2 would have been rated only 3 of 5.  Like I said they have gone way down recently."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Everytime I eat here my stomach says THANK YOU!  The food is fresh, tasty and affordable.  All the people a very nice.   Ali is the best."}
{"text":"I worry this place won't stay alive. The tables had dried rice on them and the floor was sticky. Only a total of 6 people in the restaurant during peak lunch hour and 2 of the customers waited so long for their food that they were forced to ask for it to go. Serious! How could you not keep up with 6 customers??"}
{"text":"Had their Thursday special with lamb shank. So good! I really liked the decor and how clean the place was. The counter help was very friendly and knew customers by name. Nice! Will go back!"}
{"text":"My daughter and son-in-law went there around 15 minutes before closing to have dinner last night. They said the food was really good, BUT at 8:20PM the girl came to their table and said we closed at 8:00PM here's a \"To-Go\" box, I'll take care of your plate.  Strangest thing I've ever heard.  I guess customer service isn't what they're known for!"}
{"text":"The lamb kabobs were off and the restaurant smelled like the restrooms.  The rice ran out and we had to change our order to half salad half rice.  The grilled tomato was not grilled, the pita was cold and worst of all, the rice was not completely cooked and I almost chipped my tooth on hard rice.  Probably one of the worst experiences I have had in the recent years.  The staff was friendly.  I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food but the counter service sucks!!! Such a shame. I'm not coming back because of the counter girl with neck tattoos and bag attitude"}
{"text":"Inexpensive and good service.  Will go back and try different menu items."}
{"text":"I am sure this restaurant's food appeals to many, but not us.  Fortunately, we had a Groupon.  Had their chicken shawarma, and it you like curry, then this is for you.  I do not like curry.  The curry this dish was so overwhelming that I could not eat it.  My husbands had a gyro with a side salad.  The gyro meat had no seasoning.  Tasted more like boiled meat that had been subsequently grilled.  His salad was no more than mere tail ends of head lettuce with a couple of cucumbers.  The Taziki (?) sauce had such a strong taste of yogurt, which was not pleasant tasting.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"We went there Saturday 6/30/2012, we got there around 6pm and it got real busy since they just had a groupon,which we used as well. Kayvan(hope I m spelling name correctly) handled the crowd with a great smile, amazing customer service, he brought each person's food out and came back to ask how was everything.We loved how he didn't panic with all the customers,great employee.We will go back since we love the food and now the service:)"}
{"text":"Reasonable prices.  Some Mediteranian restaurants will charge you $3 extra if you don't want all rice and want to do half a salad, But at the ZK, half and half is the standard, and for about $10.  I did a lamb and all rice dinner.  The lamb was \"buttery\" which hopefully was ghee and not seasoned with herbs the way most do it.  The rice is awesome although I have been there a couple of times and once got a little bit of saffron rice on top, and the second time got a lot. Definitely had a good experience, and worth the money.
Not much for ambiance, but hey, I was there for the food."}
{"text":"Great quality , fresh Persian food , great kababs!  The chef here knows how to make every dish on their menu perfect."}
{"text":"The chicken and rice was very good. I really loved the pita bread and hummus. The employees were super friendly and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love greek food, just love it. Was excited to try ZK. Placed a to go order on the phone and the lady was rude. Got my order which was a chicken greek salad and chicken \"entree\". There was about 8 tiny chunks of chicken between the two, almost no feta cheese on the salad, the side salad that came with the chicken meal was iceberg lettuce and that was it. I wasn't impressed at all. For the price it was a total rip, I'd rather go to Z's greek and get way more food for the money. Won't be back"}
{"text":"This place is a classic, if your in the mood for Mediterranean or if you are hosting a dinner party last minute. The food tastes great, moist and juicy meats, great sizes and they have this yummy I've cream my daughter loves. I think it's made from safron, anyways it's a great little spot for home cooking."}
{"text":"I have now had their filet, gyro and lamb. All done very nicely. Charred outside and juicy inside. Rice is always fluffy and hot. My salad had a few ice chips, this detail tells me they care about fresh!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. The Sharma wrap was amazing.  The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Very yummy!  I had the lamb kabob entree which came with a salad, rice, a grilled tomato, the kabob and a pita!  Everything was very good.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"At one point in time this would have been 5 stars! We loved this place and would come here quite often. The best part about it was their delicious homemade pita bread. We would often get catering from here for small events and order extra pita because everyone would rave about it. So, we went in a couple weeks ago, ordered dinner and pita and were served this cardboard, store bought frisbees! According to the helpful young man at the counter, the owners are doing away with the homemade pita and these are what we are left with. He said he had been getting a lot of complaints since the change. This change really made this place lose its specialness. Now it just seems really generic. Too bad! Unfortunately we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Very good with reasonable prices. I would definitely check them out! They often have groupings which makes for a great deal! The staff have always been polite and attentive."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place.
 Since we've been in Phoenix we've tried a number of middle eastern restaurants. None so far are up to the standard we are acostomb to.
The counter woman was very nice and helpful.
The restaurant is very basic but clean.
The food however was the disappointment..
We ordered a gyro & fries, a chicken Sharma & fries, and a beef pita & fries, humus and bread .
The shwarma tasted pretty good, but it was on the thick bread usually reserved for gyros. The beef pita, was also on the gyro bread, but was kinda nasty. We tried giving the meat to the dogs but they wouldn't touch it.
Oddly enough, the gyro was delicious and overflowing with meat.
All the fries were soggy, but that is probably because they are shoestring fries in to-go boxes.
The humus was watery and had a thick covering of vegetable oil instead of a drizzle of olive oil.
The pita bread, at extra cost, was 1 piece of gyro bread.

So.. if you're looking for a quick, inexpensive meal, this place will do. If you're looking for an authentic middle East meal, keep looking.. I am.."}
{"text":"I can't understand why anyone would like this place.  I saw the comparisons to Crazy Jim's and Pita Jungle so I thought I knew what type of food to expect.  Oh, but how I was wrong!.  I wasn't expecting the Persian Room.  However, I wasn't expecting them to run out of rice!!!!!!!!!!!!! Nor was I expecting the \"grilled tomato\" to be a giant, flavorless roma that had just been boiled and put on the plate.  I wasn't expecting the salad to be a chopped mess of iceberg with a couple of pieces of red onion.  And I wasn't expecting to wait over 15 minutes in an almost empty restaurant for all of this.  Oh Zaytoon, the pictures your post on your website are nothing like the food we got."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat out a lot and when we find a place that we like their food and service, we stick to it. ZK Grill (formerly Zaytoon) is one of those places with really great tasting food and wonderful service at a reasonable price. We have been going there ever since they opened. We have always enjoyed their food, I usualy order chicken kabob but last night, I added a filet kabob and kobideh to my order. We  loved it, it was very tender and juicy. I think I have a new favorite dish at ZK Grill now. This place offers the best persian food that you can find in Arizona and I highly recommend you trying it"}
{"text":"Yum!  I really enjoy this place.  Especially when you can find it on Groupons makes it even better.  

It is what it is... fast casual type of food so don't go there thinking your going to some fancy restaurant.  The prices are good, the amount of food you get is good and they are consistently... Good."}
{"text":"Yummy :) we got Thursday special and number 19 which is the chicken plate , very delicious :) I always enjoy ZK food :) thank for the good costumer service"}
{"text":"There's truly nothing like ZK Grill in the valley.  If you're looking for authentic, simply delicious Persian cuisine, look no further than ZK Grill.  Their food and service are second to none."}
{"text":"Horrible service, they messed up my order, and the meat was dried out. Very overpriced. I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Clean place. Friendly staff! As rookies of a kabob place we each got a wrap with a side salad. My hubs got a Chicken wrap and gave it two thumbs up!  I got the Filet wrap which I would also give two thumbs up for. They have a great selection and a menu with weekday specials that we can not wait to return to try!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken entree and the falafal wrap. Food is great, but I felt the meat portion was a bit less. Didn't like the ambience of the place though. If you are looking for some good Mediterranean food and don't want to spend much then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I have always liked Persian/Middle Eastern food. Zaytoon Kabob has a variety of meals including specials for each day of the week. Also the food is inexpensive. The bistro is a comfortable setting.  It looks like a cozy cafe or deli.There are plenty of options on the menu to choose from. Nice large pieces of homemade baklava are displayed in a cold container and they look sweet and juicy. The first thing I ever ordered there was the Barberry Rice & Chicken. It tasted sweet and juicy, yet not greasy. When I talked to the owners, they said that they made their food with fresh nonfattening ingredients. To top it all off, I ordered their homemade Persian Saffron Ice Cream. The ice cream was not too sweet and a had a nice aroma too it."}
{"text":"I was excited to see this place open by my house.  It's always good to have a place nearby to get quick take-out.  I was impressed that it was clean, and had a decent menu.  I had the chicken kabob wrap.  It was delicious.  We also started with the hummus, which was just okay.  I will be back for another wrap for sure.  Very friendly people working there.   They say hello before you even get through the door."}
{"text":"The service makes this place, so friendly and kind...makes for a great experience. Gyro is one of the best in Phoenix and the salads are great too."}
{"text":"Prices have gone up about a dollar each. My favorite, Greek salad with chicken is now $9.99. Still well worth it for great fresh food."}
{"text":"We were looking to cater to a party, and were testing and tasting various middle eastern / persian restaurants and my husband found this one.
We are very glad to find this here, because all the other mid east/persian restaurants were fail.
The catering was perfect, and we have been there several times since."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this place, dont let the name fool you. Its Mediterranean food and its delicious,  they have a wide variety including lamb. I had the chicken shawarma and it was very tasty and the portions were rather large. The prices are kinda large also but well worth it. Try the different dressings they have for the salads they are very flavorful.  No waiters but they did bring the food over once we made our order at the counter. Highly recommend this place if you are hungry and have a little extra dough."}
{"text":"Amazing! Monster portions and monster quality! Seasoned and grilled to perfection. Had the chicken and filet."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for lunch with my girlfriend. It took a good 15 minutes to make one gyro plate and one Caesar salad.The lettuce for both meals was going bad and pink on the edges. The chicken in the Caesar salad and that gyro meat itself and the hummus were good. The Gyro plate did not come with a pita. This meal cost $23 with tax. A total rip off. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. It is sooo hot in the restaurant that after asking woman behind the register how she handled the heat in there she said she was fine with the heat. My friend and I sat there waiting for our food literally sweating. My butt was sticking to the seat due to the heat. There was no one in the restaurant. Not one person except the cook and the cashier. We started eating and asked for boxes moments later because the heat was unbearable. If I wanted to sweat, I would have gone to the gym. The woman told us to move to a different corner of the restuarant cause it was cooler there. Ummm ok? When I asked her if we could have silver ware she pointed to a table with forks and kept playing on her phone. Never again. Ohhh yeah.. The Food was average."}
{"text":"Great food and good service. The chicken swharma wrap with fries is really good. When I want to go a little healthier I get the chicken plate. You get a choice of salad or rice or you can get half and half. The grape leaf wraps are good and hummus is too. Basically everything I've had is good! If you get a to go order it can take awhile, but that's because they cook everything fresh to order. It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Brittany is awesome! This was my first time eating Persian food, and it was a great experience. I love the fish tank and friendly staff. I hope to enjoy coming here many more times!"}
{"text":"Had the lamb shank special on Thursday and honestly it is orgasmic. My fiance and I are big fans of lamb and it was falling off the bone tender and moist with this tomato type gravy sauce that was perfect for it. Rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned. We'll go back for sure! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Come for the food. It's always consistently great. The Saffron ice cream is phenomenal. The first bite is an explosion of flavor and by the last bite you cannot get enough."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! And a ton of food. Will definitely go back. I had the Greek salad with chicken and ordered a side of hummus and the hummus lasted a week!"}
{"text":"It's alright. I have had better Mediterranean in Phoenix. I might come back if I'm here by. 

There fries are really good. My wife ordered beef Gyro, she really liked it. I ordered Lamb Gyro, it was ok."}
{"text":"The food has been consistently good at this location.  The prices are very reasonable.  We typically order the beef kebab and the gyros.  The grilled tomatoes are good too.  It is good but not amazing.  The food is on par with Persian Room, but at a much affordable price point."}
{"text":"Food was good, but nothing huge to write home about. Its a nice alternative to Crazy Jims or the ever crap-tastic Pita Jungle, but its nothing amazing. 

I would have given it 4 stars, but for the service. I don't like to stand for 10 minutes while the two counter girls sort out what it is they're doing. Further, if they're just sitting around, really they need to deliver the food.

Add some more spice, up the amount of fries, and fire the two girls that were working on Sunday September 18 and you'll be a 4!"}
{"text":"I have been buying food at this place over the past 2 years. I am not sure whether owner has been changed or they want to save cost. I noticed that they had cut their meat portion significantly 2 weeks ago. I always ordered ghormeh sabzi and gyros wrap. I thought maybe the chef has done some kind of mistakes and gave only a few pieces of meat for each dish. Therefore, I have gone back again this week. Same thing had happened. 
For Ghormeh Sabzi, 3 pieces of small beef cube And rice which cost $9.99 before tax. 
For gyros wrap, 5 small pieces of gyro meat which cost $7.99 before tax.


We will stop going to this place from now onwards as it is not value for the money that we paid.

I just found out that this place was name Zaytoon Kabob Bistro. And previously ghormeh sabzi only price at $8.99 with more meat served. Now meat portion has been cut down and price has been increased."}
{"text":"Local recommendation, we loved the food and reasonable!  Plenty to eat.  Order at counter then take a seat.  Clean and very friendly.  Lamb was delicious and so was the ground beef kabob.  Will be back"}
{"text":"I know Persian food. I love Persian food. I live and breathe Persian food. Oh, and yes, I'm Persian. Take my word......this place is AWESOME. Very fresh, authentic and TASTY!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, you won't regret trying it.
If you love Iranian (Persian) food its the place to be.

I like the \"Ground beef\" and \"Falafel Wrap\" 
the prices are great comparing to other Iranian restaurants."}
{"text":"We love this awesome little restaurant! The food is so fresh and flavorful. Ali is so accommodating and friendly as well. He goes out of his way to consider my food allergies and substitutes where he can. It is a diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"We've been on the fence with this place until the other day I called in for a to go order, gave them 20 mins, and when I showed up they said the Gyro machine is broken... was it working when I called in? No apology was the kicker and the guy acted like I was bothering him. Aside from that, if this was a rating for just the food I'd give 3, maybe even 4 stars. The gyro meat, the lamb, and chicken are good but the portion sizes have been different each time, Bland french fries are bland, they only give you HALF a pita (really? do you actually cut it in half?) for a dinner entree, good rice, but haven't yet had one of their \"grilled tomatoes\" on ANY entree... mytserious...

They are a little over priced, true, but that's not the big problem, if everything else was good we'd be here twice a week, but you'll notice they nickel and dime you on extras, and not good customer service that we've seen so far, and those two together can ruin a restaurant!"}
{"text":"The hummus and pita I ordered were decent but the service was very poor. The first cashier completely ignored me and the second cashier eventually strolled up to the cash register with her phone in hand and treated me as though I were an inconvenience. They had an overall poor attitude and I don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"The skewers at ZK Grill are so good that you'll keep eating them even when you're full. The rice that comes with the meals is light and fluffy with a very nice flavor. And their french fries are pretty addicting too. The Greek salad is ... eh... just like all the others, not great but not bad.

The restaurant is always clean and so are the restrooms. 

I give ZK's 4 stars because it is a bit pricey for the this type of restaurant, counter order/pick up."}
{"text":"Zk grill is do delicious and fresh tasting! It'sy favorite restaurant in Ahwatukee!!!  The chicken and beef skewer kabob combo is to die for!"}
{"text":"I go almost every week.   Great addition to the neighborhood.  The meat kabobs are all great.  Definitely try the chicken specials on Thursday and Saturday.  Good hummus as well"}
{"text":"Good is great here. It's not close to my house but anytime we are in the area we stop by here. The chicken kabobs are great."}
{"text":"I don't know if they have changed hands or not but this is not the same place anymore.  The pita bread appears and tastes like the kind you buy in the store...no longer homemade.  Also, the service is no longer as great as it used to be. It is just meh now.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"i accidentally bought two groupons--and now i want to sell my other one!

if you have had middle eastern food--this place would probably disappoint.

i ordered many things (gyro, lamb, groundbeef kabob, hummus, salad, vegetarian quiche)... and the only one that was \"ok\" was the gyro meat with rice (but really, you can't really mess up gyro meat).  the groundbeef kabob, which is an \"add on\" side order (so they probably make a bunch) tastes rubbery and doesn't really taste or feel like food.  hummus was \"meh\" as well as the pitas they use to serve it with.  the salad, i couldn't even finish.  it's a shame when places make salads an afterthought--as if it's some cheap filler, when if they really were about food service--they'd see it as an opportunity to make vegetables yummy and appetizing!  i actually do like greek salads, but this one was just not worth it. i'm sure they have great desserts--maybe i'll spend my other groupon on ordering those.  again, im pretty sure desserts are VERY hard to mess up.

the service at this place was also not that great.  the teenager-ish girl working the register seemed flustered.  after ordering over $20 worth of food--she wanted me to buy more so that the $2 difference i'd have to pay via my debit card would be over their $8 minimum.  uhh, yeah... i already ordered over $20--im not going to order more because i obviously already went over $20.  in the end, she \"let it slide\" but still made it feel like she was doing me the favor--wtf?  i understand the charges for cards are expensive, but if a customer obviously already paid  you via groupon--then don't make it out to be that you're doing me a favor.  that should've been addressed when you made the vouchers in the first place!  otherwise, my stupid groupon would be useless if i actually had to spend $28 to use a $20 groupon.

also, as with many stupid restaurants in phoenix--why do they close at 8pm?!  is this a city we live in or not?!  if the place was located in sun city, then i'd understand.. but really eating dinner at 8pm is not unreasonable!"}
{"text":"Finally after extensive searching I have found my favorite Mediterranean place! It has a very local feel and the staff is friendly. The food has ALWAYS come out fresh, sometimes I can't believe how amazing their fruits and vegetables are. I would come here just to get some of their perfectly ripe tomatoes, something I am very particular about. The gyro wrap and the beef entree are my go to choices, however everything else I have tried has been incredible. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Since the day Zaytoon opened, I've been a regular customer. If I happened to be in the neighborhood I would stop there every time. Many times I'd driven across town specifically to go to the restaurant... it was that good.
There was one thing that separated them from all the rest... The bread. Much to my dismay, after driving across town one evening last week to have dinner, I was given their \"new\" pita. When I asked where the regular bread was, I was told the new owners/manager didn't want to be bothered making that bread any longer. Here is a perfect example of shortsightedness. In order to not be bothered with what I guess is an extra step or two in making a superior product, the customer base will now begin to disappear. When I said to the girl that that was the main reason I come across town for their restaurant, she told me that many people were upset and complaining and said they would no longer be coming to the restaurant. I told her she could add me to that list. Their hummus recipe also appears to have changed. And not for the better. They are now simply a mediocre Mediterranean restaurant like all the others."}
{"text":"They are a little on the expensive side. I like their chicken dish. The lamb was disappointing. The rice is a bit dry. The staff are very nice though."}
{"text":"Best Persian food in Phoenix! Great service. Owner was there and greeted us personally. Even gave amazing saffron ice cream because it was our sons birthday! Will go back for sure and recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my son's favorites.  We usually order the filet and chicken combo with rice and salad for $13.99.  Delicious meal, plenty of food for the two of us and a great value.  Cannot prepare something this healthy for the price.  We frequent this restaurant often."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Food was generous fresh and delicious service was great. Pricing is great. I ordered a gyro with lamb. Yummy :)"}
{"text":"It was OK. Service was friendly, but slow. Food was OK, but I don't think it was a good value."}
{"text":"Delicious meals to be had with fresh ingredients. Recommend the greek salad and kebabs.  Great taste and presentation.  Service was helpful and friendly. This could easily be a regular check in place."}
{"text":"My Mom and I went there for dinner yesterday with a Groupon coupon.  We weren't expecting much, but it turned out to be a delightful experience.  Mom had a gyro plate and I the eggplant stew.  The portions were enormous and the seasonings perfect.  The young lady at the counter who took our order and then served the meal was charming.  We will definitely be going back -- coupon or no!"}
{"text":"Jk grill is an amazing Persian restaurant to go to in enjoy good food. It's like the Persian room but cheaper."}
{"text":"Food and service was great!!  Insanely friendly staff, seemingly authentic food, but very tasty food! Beware of the carbonated yogurt; for the brave only!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were on our way to Subway and decided to try Zaytoon instead. Sorry Subway this is now my go to place for a quick meal that happens to be right by my house.

We both had  the Gyro's which were HUGE we probably could have shared one. Our son had the chicken kabob. Both items were delicious. Our items also came with fries that didn't even get touched. 

Prices were fair. Looking forward to going back to try the daily specials!"}
{"text":"I'm going to warn you now, the portions here are well sized! The service was good, I didn't sit down to eat myself, but the other two tables that were being waited on seemed quite content. The chef in the back makes great food! I don't know how he does it, but my meat was juicy, and looked like it had the most heavenly glaze on it! I liked the option of being able to choose all salad with my entree instead of rice and salad, because the pomegranate dressing was great! Definitely coming back! But buisiness for this place seems so slow... I can't imagine why."}
{"text":"Finally used my Groupons before they expired.  I wish I had used them 
earlier because I could have been eating here for months!

The food here is excellent. My first trip, I ordered a Chicken kabob entree with a Ground Beef kabob added.  Both were amazing.  The chicken was moist and delicious.  As for the ground beef, I haven't had Koobideh that good since I was dating a Persian girl.  I had a salad as the side on that entree and it was, well, standard side salad.  The grilled tomato though was the final touch.  I love them!  the bread was perfect.  Little black charred spots around the edges with soft, doughy centers.  So good!

My lady got Fish.  I thought it was OK but she was pleased and that's what counts.

On the second visit, I had the Gyro entree.  It was good.  The gyro was standard Kronos but I got some crusty and some moist shavings, which is always nice.  The yogurt sauce was great.  The rice wasn't too bad, either.  What did make this special was the quantity.  I thought they shaved the whole spit on my plate!  I couldn't finish it and I can chow down with the best of em!

I can't wait to try the Falafel and the Tabbouleh and the Ghomeh Sabzi and the list goes on.

Bummer is they don't have fresh brewed iced tea.  During the summer months I only get water cups anyway so I'm not going to dock any points for this, today.  ;)

Prices are very reasonable (cheap) and the staff and owner are incredibly friendly even though I showed up twice in one week with Groupons.  This isn't a full service joint and I was asked how my food was twice with big smiles, each visit.  I even got 'goodbyes' upon exit.

This place is on the short list of where I'll be eating, from now on."}
{"text":"Generally I'm always 100% satisfied with my take out orders but tonight it was awful.  I ordered a #14 and there was no side dressing with a minimum amount of dressing already on it. I also ordered a hummus appetizer which came with 1 pita bread. Dropped the ball tonight and disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Greek food! Our faves are the chicken kabob plate with rice, and gyro wrap. The rice is so flavorful. The taztziki sauce goes so well with everything Greek. This place has a mom n pop feel to it. They have a small variety of desserts too. Value for $ is ok."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!!!! Service was a joke. As soon as she found out I had a groupon she could care less to help. She flat out lied about the \"homemade\" bottled italian dressing and never once came over and asked if we needed anything, wanted anything or anything else. HELLO!!!! arent you the one who needs business???? And beside all of that, the food was marginal. I've had better. I will never go back, not even for FREE food."}
{"text":"One of the best and freshest Mediterranean inspired restaurants in the valley. 

I've had a number of the dishes and love them all. My favorite is the lamb kabob. Perfectly seasoned meat accompanied by a soft warm pita and a generous salad. The salad dressing -served on the side - is always wonderfully balanced."}
{"text":"FAST FOOD & PERSIAN FOOD ARE USUALLY NOT SYNONOMYS! 
As A Persian Food Aficionado, I have had Kabob all over the world... 
I love Persian Food! \"No!\" I love good Persian food! 
Well the first few times I was walking into The Subway restaurant next door to this place I peeked, but was very hesitant to walk in! Well thanks to my buddy I finally tried it. I must say I was pleasantly surprised! The Kabobs: Kubiedeh, Barg (the cuts of fillet), and Chicken Kabob are all tasty, and the daily dishes are all very authentic & tasty.  The ambiance is standard fast food restaurant, the staff is very friendly & greets you when you walk in, and answer any questions you may have.
So if you want to skip McDonalds and Subway and go Mediterranean,  Zaytoon Kabob is a great choice for the real Middle Eastern dining experience!"}
{"text":"The newest location of Zaytoon Kabob Bistro has just opened, and I, for one, am a happy guy. Quick, casual Persian kabobs? Sign me up.

BACKGROUND
----------------------
Apparently Zaytoon's first 2 locations, in north Phoenix and Chandler, opened while I'd been away on the East Coast, and as such had no idea they even existed until I got back. Given I live so close by, I'd seen the sign for the 16th & Camelback St location since moving back to Phoenix last month but had not seen any progress in it opening, so I'd been hoofing it up to north Phoenix instead to grab some eats.

Why go through such trouble? I'm a huge fan of Persian food, undoubtedly helped by being stuffed to the gills by my Persian friends' moms whenever I'm visiting LA (\"I wish you were my son - you love to eat my food so much! Unlike my own children, you know how to appreciate my cooking and not worry about the fitting into tight shirts from Armani Exchange!\").

VENUE
----------
Like the other locations, the 16th Street Zaytoon (sandwiched between a Subway and a nail salon, around the corner from Sports Authority) is fast casual: order at the counter and then bring the food to your table.  

There isn't a whole lot happening here in terms of atmosphere, apart from a few printed photographs of food on the walls and some soft Persian music lilting from the speakers.   

MENU
--------- 
* A limited number of Persian kabobs (beef, lamb, chicken, fish, shrimp), as well as gyros for those craving as such, and can come in a wrap or as an entree (with either rice or salad). For carb conscious folk, you can also order just the skewers of meat/chicken by themselves.
* Vegetarians have the option of having a Persian-style veggie quiche instead or falafel instead.
* A good selection of appetizers, including kashk e bademjan (a tasty warm Persian eggplant dip) and \"Zaytoon hummus\" (hummus mixed with kalamata olives), and a number of salads
* A rotating daily special featuring a traditional dish popular in Iran, including chicken, lamb, beef, and rice dishes
* Desserts include saffron ice cream and a sweet, sticky fried dough dessert called zoolbia bamiyeh

MY TAKE ON THE FOOD
----------------------------------
I've been to Zaytoon a good number of times now and am pleased with the grub for the price I'm paying for it. Zaytoon isn't a full-scale sit down Persian restaurant where they take their sweet time to cook dishes authentically to bring out the best and most complex flavors. It's a fast-casual joint after all, and they have to make sure they get their dishes out as fast as possible. It's not the Persian Room (or any number of amazing Persian restaurants in LA), but its dishes are also 1/3 of the price of any of those places.

While most customers I've seen come in stick to ordering what they're most familiar with (gyros, falafel, hummus, tabouleh, etc.), I'd definitely recommend giving their selection of Persian dishes a shot:
* Their chicken kabobs are lightly flavored with saffron and are always well-grilled and never dry.   
* Their eggplant appetizer is tasty, and a great dish to enjoy while waiting for your entree  
* Their weekly specials include a number of my favorite Persian dishes: 
-- Zereshk Polo (saffron-flavored barberry rice and chicken) on Mondays
-- Baghali Polo (rice with dill and lima beans, served with chicken or beef kabobs or a lamb shank) on Thursdays
-- and Khoresht Fesenjan (chicken in a tart yet savory pomegranate-walnut stew) on Saturdays

I've had the barberry rice and pomegranate chicken specials and, given the short amount of time they have to put these out (and therefore taking a few unauthentic shortcuts), they're not the most complex dishes, but they still manage to be tasty and enjoyable over a quick meal. 

MY TAKE ON THE SERVICE
--------------------------------------
The staff has always been friendly, personable and fast. I've seen the owner drop by this location and ask the patrons how they're all enjoying their food. He's even offered me hot tea after seeing me engrossed in long conversation with a friend (which, of course, calls for tea). 

OVERALL
--------------
The 16th St & Camelback location has been open just recently but I'm such a repeat customer already that they all know me by now. I like the grub and the fact it's so conveniently close to me. An order of a skewer of chicken kabobs and a side of shirazi salad (kind of a Persian pico de gallo) is a sure-fire healthy meal and not nearly as mundane as the Subway next door. 

It's not blow-your-mind Persian cuisine, but it's great value for the money and still tasty and will get you out in and out the door fast (especially convenient for those who work nearby and are on their lunch hour).  I haven't done too many of their more \"Mediterranean\" dishes so I can't really remark on those, but folks I've talked to who have enjoyed their dishes.

A welcome new flavor amidst the 16th & Camelback chain hell.  Hope these guys make it for the long haul.

{"text":"We've been dining here on a regular basis. the food is terrific and the portion sizes are quite large. remember to take home extra skewers of grilled meats. the service has always been good and the servers are very pleasant."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food and the portions are HUGE! I'm a 6'4\" 250lb man and I can't finish a plate by myself. Great place to eat if you like to get full and NOT spend an arm and a leg. My wife even shares a plate with our 3 kids and still has a hard time finishing it. These guys do an amazing job!"}
{"text":"I went today but with my disappointment the doors were locked and nobody was there it was during the middle of the day at about 1 o'clock on April 18TH 2016. My favorite food there was the chicken shawarma has such good flavor and was very very sad that they were not open. Not sure if they've closed this location but they do have good food."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Gilbert CK Grill and the food was always fresh and yummy and delicious the one in Ahwatukee not so much. and the chicken shawarma wrap was dry and overcooked the french fries were stale and just wasn't the best. Very disappointed after driving from Gilbert. I was really looking forward to this meal too :("}
{"text":"delish!!! get the kobedeh kabob and rice!! yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent.  I have eaten here several times.  Looks like they re-modeled it recently.  The menu has changed as well.  Overall, pretty solid food and decent portions.  We like the Persian room better, but obviously the prices are a lot higher over there.  For a good Persian or Mediterranean fix, hit this place up.  It's worth it.  Get a combo and double rice, and you'll easily have two meals.  You'll have lunch for tomorrow.  Prices are pretty reasonable.  My favorite is the Gyro plate combo.  They give you a good amount of meat with a lot of rice and a pita on the side.  They have good yogurt dip and hummus.

My only knock or complain is the smell outside of the building.  It's like a sewage leak or busted pipe.  There might be a drain hole around in the area, but when you walk up to the place, you always smell it.  Then you walk in the restaurant and you are greeted with another powerful smell.  Regardless, if you go there, you'll see what I'm talking about.

Sorry no pics, I ordered it to go and forgot."}
{"text":"Yum! I got the gyro. Husband got the sirloin kabobs. My kids got chicken kabobs and rice. We loved everything. Tzaziki was tasty. We misunderstood that our chicken didn't come with rice so they were kind enough to give us a plate of rice for no extra charge. 

Friendly staff. Very affordable. Great place!"}
{"text":"Glad I found this place. Easy walk from the hotels near the I-10 freeway. A couple vegetarian and vegan options. The falafel wrap was excellent. The four offered salad dressings were interesting. Make that three. One was ranch. Meh. I felt the price was about 25% too high for this simple lunch option, but not unreasonably so."}
{"text":"possibly the best gyro I've ever had. Tabouli was great. And you need to try the saffron ice cream. Hummus was a"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm Persian and i just had a best beef kabob of my life   :D
I really recommend this place, u must try it"}
{"text":"The only downside is that I didn't find this place sooner. No joke, that's exactly what my husband said when we finished our meals. Bottom line is that this place delivers fresh tasting flavorful food in generous portions for decent prices. Worth going back to try more menu items and when I'm craving gyros (which is quite often) - yum!"}
{"text":"Great food and the lady taking our order was very cheery and enthusiastic. It brought a smile to my face as if she was inviting me to her home."}
{"text":"ZK Grill is affordable and offers some decent value for the price.  I ventured out and more or less got a pita with a kebab in it called the \"Ground Beef Wrap\".  As a sandwich it didn't make the most sense because the kebab was basically cut in half and was awkward to attempt to eat as part of a sandwich, almost falling out with every bite.

Overall though I have no complaints about the food, just not quite hitting that next level that would earn them a 5 star review."}
{"text":"I make Middle Eastern food and have been to a lot of M.E. restaurants and this place is at the top of my list for awesome food! It is incredibly fresh which is key when eating this type of food. I got a Gyro and Tabouleh and you definitely get a bang for your buck too! I can't wait to go back and try everything else! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Chicken kabobs are good. Kind of wish more options for sides. Service is eh. But healthy food so I may try again."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant a few days ago for dinner while my husband and son were at the mall.  I had the chicken with half rice and half salad. I have lived in Ahwatukee for 15 years,  and am so bummed I haven't tried this place earlier!! I liked it so much I brought my husband and son back the next day.  

The food tasted very fresh and they were huge portions  (we each had our own meal and we all had enough left overs for the next nights meal). 

I am a big fan of kabobs,  tziki and salads... It just feels like a healthier eating option than fast food.  There are a few other places like this that are close by,  but they are a little more franchise'ish with smaller portions.  

The staff here was also very nice.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant,  I'm sure it will be a new constant for me."}
{"text":"I visited Zaytoon with a friend today upon her suggestion.  I work in the area and saw that it had gone into this particular strip mall but had not had a chance to eat there yet.

I read the reviews on Yelp prior to going and was prepared to have a long wait.  There were no lines when we arrived and we ordered promptly.  She and I waited only about 5-10 minutes before our food was brought to us.

I ordered the chicken kabob entree which came with rice and pita.  The chicken was quite flavorful and cooked well.  The rice and pita were nice additions to the plate.  The price was $7 + change which is fairly reasonable.

There was a slow stream of customers while we were there, many of whom ordered take out.

I would return to this place."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Everything is fresh and perfectly grilled and friendly service too. We come here pretty much every Sunday."}
{"text":"Name of the place is a bit confusing. It's in a strip mall and signage shows ZK Grill out front.   Had the beef kabobs which were tasty.  Falafel was a little bland.  Also there tahini was a little strange.  It had a tone of Parsley in it, so you tasted that mainly, and not the sesame seed flavor.  Rice that it came with was tasty though."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is almost as good as my grandma's home-made Persian food. The service & prices are on point. I dine in or take out weekly & have never been disappointed. Support your local small businesses & try it!"}
{"text":"The only thing I can say omg food is great . Customer service was great I love chicken + beef plate it's really good  ..."}
{"text":"While I really love the food here, I called in a to go order as I was on my way to work and when I got there the cook had been chatting with someone at a table and my order was not made. I was in a rush to get to work and found this unacceptable. They made my order quickly but I was very disappointed. Apparently socializing is more important to the cook than working."}
{"text":"Filet Kabob is super tasty. If you get it over salad its also healthy. Highly recommend. I agree though, the prices could come down a little bit. Overall the food is very good."}
{"text":"WORST food I have ever had. Ordered through Uber Eats-food arrived cold, gyro meat was bland, cold and full of hard gristle. Baklava was soggy mush, couldn't even eat it and threw it away. Forgot silverware with to go order. Worst geek I've ever had."}
{"text":"'Thank you Yelpers for giving me Zaytoon as a recommended restaurant.
We had lunch there today to give it a try.  I had the falafel sandwich with a side order of Tabouleah salad and my friend had the lamb kabob wrap.
The falafel was moist and well garnished with lettuce, tomatoes and onions. The tandoori bread was awesome.  It came with a side of what seems to be avocado mixed with humus (at least that's what my taste buds said).  The lamb kabobs were perfectly cooked and generous.  
I checked out the bathroom and it was very clean.  The whole atmosphere is clean and tidy and the owner/ staff were very welcoming.  I will be back 'to try something different.  and... the prices are very reasonable ($4.99 for falafel and 8.99 for the lamb.) Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"One of the best in metro Phoenix!

Seriously, you need to go here. The portions are just enough that will surely leave you full for the next couple of hours.

Also, whatever you do; don't try the soda yogurt. You've been warned! Do not!"}
{"text":"It's OK. There are far better places. I guess the best thing I can say is this: I didn't get sick from the food, so there is that. Service is not that good either."}
{"text":"This place is so fresh and so green green!!! :) 
  I loved my chicken wrap, to bad their so close to my official work place or else I would eat this over Jimmy John's and Subway any day!! This time I was luckily around the area getting training done at another work location nearby this little bad boy!! 
 How lucky was I, I had heard of this place from an old classmate from Tempe, he used to work here and also had invited me over to try some of their goodness, plus the prices are affordable and understandable to their selections!! 
I truly loved the flavors in my wrap, so full and bold, I was satisfied and still feeling healthy in the end!! 
Way to go ZK Bistro!!!!!! You rock!!! :) I look forward to coming here more often!!"}
{"text":"Good choice if you want Persian or Mediterranean food fast. They have a good variety of kabobs and other Persian food. The pomegranate chicken was tasty. For me it's more of a take out than eat in kind of place but a great addition to the area's food options."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food, and reasonably priced. It's not often you find this kind ofquality together under the same roof."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've ordered delivery from this place. I wanted to like it because I'm about small businesses blah blah blah but it's incredibly disappointing. I ordered some beef stew thing which was $10, and it literally had one single 1\" cube of beef in it. That cube was floating in a sea of mystery greens and OIL. Hella nasty. The tzatziki was pretty yummy, but came with no pita. In fact, both times I've ordered my entree has come with 1/2 a pita. That's it. 

It's definitely over priced, under portioned, and lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"You will not find any Persian Kabob entree's for cheaper in the Valley. I've been coming to Zaytoon since it first opened and have yet found a reason to stop going.  I felt very welcomed by the friendly owner & staff at Zaytoon. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing mediterranean food, being Vegan, it's hard to find places that have veg-friendly food, but this place delivers, The Falafel is The Best!!!"}
{"text":"I blame my fellow Yelpers for this one. 

After reading all the great reviews on ZK Grill I knew I had to try it out. Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon and there was only 1 other couple ordering food to go. I didn't blame them the place was a hole in the wall I took my food to go also. 

Service:  I hope the lady at the counter was having a bad day and that was not her personality bc she didn't have any.

Food: I ordered the shawarma sandwhich & the kabob + beef combo. The chicken tastes like rubber and lacked all flavor. The beef was chewy, not tender  and I didn't taste much flavor. The kabob was alright, needed some seasoning added to it to make it good but the was it was served it wasn't. The fries... they were so white the blended in with the styraphome, tasted like card board and had NO salt on them. Fries should be golden and crispy and salted. That's a French fry. 

I do NOT recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've eaten (technically got take out) at Zaytoon Kabob twice and was delighted both times.  The second time they were especially accommodating in letting me substitute 2 different specialty salads (half and half Taboule and Shirazi) instead of the rice or garden salad choice that comes standard with their kabobs, for a very small extra surcharge.  That speaks to how they operate - very friendly (and swift) service with a desire to please.  I've had the lamb kabob both times, and others in my party tried the shrimp kabob and fish kabob, and two of us got the ground beef kabob that's an available add-on to our entrees - all were delicious.  The Zaytoon hummus is wonderful.  Don't miss the saffron ice cream!"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good.  Drove by and saw this place so decided to try it out. 
 Prices are reasonable and offered traditional Mediterranean meals that tasted amazing.  

this should expand and overtake the larger chains that are crap.  The food did take a while to come out but there was about 8 people in line in front and considering the small operation and made to order food, I understand."}
{"text":"Left hungry. Disappointed in the amount of meat you get. Service was very friendly. Not worth going here unless you have a groupon."}
{"text":"I came in tonight, my second visit and this time I just had to write a review! I arrived just 10 minutes before closing the waitress could not of been any sweeter, and helpful!  I'm wanted a vegetarian meal. She was so patient and  created a delicious meal for me! I do wish there was more veggies on the menu but what I had was delightful!!! A delicious salad with grilled peppers and cucumber and a side of the most amazing eggplant dip!!! She let me know the secret they do update the menu annually so hopefully my wishes will come true! I love to support the local restaurants in my neighborhood and I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Hands down best gyro/chicken wrap for the value in the area - it's filling, it's fresh, and each order comes with a generous serving of tzatziki. $6.55 including tax at the time of this writing. I'll have to reserve the extra star due to the price of \"fancier\" entrees that are not as filling, but I've been thoroughly pleased every time I've been there. Take cash, and call ahead - you can grab and go for convenience's sake."}
{"text":"We ordered from here by mistake thinking it was our favorite place (Mika's).  When we got the food it looked very different.  

* The tzaziki sauce was sweet and we like it sour (preference)
* the salad dressings were the typical Italian (?????) champaign, things that don't seem to fit the menu.
* the meat was so dry we could not even chew most of it.
* the rice has about 2% of it mixed with basmati and most was simple plain white basmati.

10 minutes after eating my son started feeling really sick and started throwing up. My husband and I quit after a few bites and we found it to be over cooked, not seasoned and seemed old.

I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with not only food but service we got.

My boyfriend picked us food from this place few times but this was my first time going in. 

Our cashier girl was extremely nice! She explained and answered any questions we had. Her beautiful smile and kindness will for sure take us back for more of great Persian food. 

Also, the portions per my opinion are pretty big. I always have leftovers next day. 

I also like that they have Groupon deals often."}
{"text":"Awesome Persian food....great prices. If you love sumac, basmati rice, meat skewers, roasted tomatoes....this is a great lunch place. Casual dining, not upscale for a formal dinner but your taste buds will leave happy."}
{"text":"This ZK grill is the best of all the ZK locations I have been to so far. The owner or whatever guy behind the counter is always super nice and happy to be there and seems to care a lot about the place. The food is always prepared fresh and tastes great."}
{"text":"Love this place for gyro wraps and tzaziki (sp?) sauce.  Sooood elicious and they pile the meat on.  The place is not fancy but it is always clean with pleasant service.  So glad I found this place!!"}
{"text":"Very good food, friendly staff, clean establishment... better then the big chain resturants"}
{"text":"we tried fillet and chicken kabobs. the food was good and the service was great. it is not a high-end Persian restaurant/food, but considering price it's a great experience . we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was good, but basic...I did only order the chicken entree plate so I did not expect more than basic. Portion was huge and cashier was very pleasant but service was quite slow for having only 2 people having lunch here at 11:30 AM. I all have to come back to try some other entree items."}
{"text":"Yummy! Been coming here since they opened. I have tried several items on the menu and they are all good. They make most everything in house including the pita bread for the wraps. The Saturday Special which is a pomegranate walnut chicken is an interesting combination of flavors and spices and worth a try. The hummus and eggplant are a good and tasty starter with the fresh pita bread. Normally we get the #8 gyro wrap with extra tzatziki sauce and red onions on the side ... a grilled stick of anything else is an additional treat. Nice portions. Some dishes come with basmati rice which are full of flavors and are really good as well. Have not tried the salads but they always look great as they are delivered to a table next to me. Fresh ingredients and healthy cooking. Sign on outside now says \"ZK GRILL\" for marketing reasons but it is still the same friendly owner and menu. See ya there next time."}
{"text":"My God, you better come hungry to this place-not only is the food good but the portions were absolutely enormous when I visited.  
I had the gyro plate and it came with about a pound of gyro meat, three cups of Basmati rice and a unique bread underneath.  Not soft and poofy like a pita or naan bread, it was thinner with a crispness to the crust.  I like to consider myself a world bread conniseur (SP??) but I've not had anything like this before.
All in all, a good visit and I'd happily come back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious food for great value. Service is prompt and would recommend it if you like Mediterranean."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  16 bucks for a sandwich and hummous is too much.  The lamb wrap was very light on lamb (maybe I'd get a bite every 3 bites).  The meat lacked flavor.  And when she delivers the hummus all surprised (as in you got the hummus too?) I later realized its because the sandwich came with fries.  Not exactly \"healthy\" as their healthy grill mantra states, nor was it on the big picture menu (showed it surrounded by grilled tomatoes).  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"ZK Grill is one of my favorite Persian food around.  The food is great.  My favorite is the filet.  My kids love it also.  The staff is always very nice.  We love going here."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food and prices are great. The staff is always friendly. Can't speak to the dine-in experience-we always take it to go. Definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Good food. Nothing spectacular.  We had the shrimp plate and the chicken plate. Rice is really good. Salad dressings were OK and not very Greek."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places in the 'tuke.   High quality chicken.  Freshest salads.  Huge portions.  We pick up take out from here at least one a week."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Their koftas are amazing. They give you huge portions on everything except the hummus but their hummus is probably the smoothest I have tasted it's very tasted and the texture is super smooth. You can go half salad and half rice which most places give you one or the other. This seems home made to me."}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal. I usually stick with just eating the kabobs, but I recently got the chicken shwarma sandwich and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I previously gave this place 4 stars (see original post below from when the restaurant was called Zaytoon) but there now seems to be new ownership, new name, new menu and a new indifference to the quality and flavor of food being served. What happened to this place???

ORIGINAL POST: Bravo for any and all authentic, independent Middle Eastern / Mediterranean restaurants in this area! This one just happens to be delicious, use high quality ingredients, be family owned and operated, and reasonably priced. There is a common theme (maybe the saffron or another spice) that makes the dishes distinctive and consistent... but also a tad uniform. Still well worth a try!"}

{"text":"This Persian eatery  is yummy! Not only do they have certain persian favorites on various days of the week, they also make their pita's from scratch!  It's tough to find quality middle-eastern food thats fast and this place impressed me.  Their hummus is also very good! I love the barberries and chicken (zereschk pollo) but they also have great pomegranate chicken.  Great for a quick bite to eat, you won't be disappointed if you appreciate middle-eastern food and especially Persian!"}
{"text":"Love the food! Have been here many times and am always impressed for how delicious the food is for the price. The meat is so tender and the rice is buttery perfection. The service is also amazing. Waiters are always kind and seem to really care about customers."}
{"text":"The food was good, and the wrap was huge, not the best I've ever had but good. The gyro tasted amazing, but the side salad looked like a leaf with a tamato."}
{"text":"I love this place. Very friendly, good food, and good price!!! Very healthy if u live the style. Highly recommend the specials too"}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all. I ended up ordering the special Deezee and getting sick from it. Nice atmosphere but the food was horrible."}
{"text":"Although I've been coming here for years, this is my first review of ZK Grill. Food is great, service is equally great. The lamb entree is cooked to perfection. Always expect a healthy serving of food with any order. I'm 6'3, 245lbs and eat more than most and I'm stuffed! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I truly enjoy this place! Everything I've tried so far was very very good. My favorite is provably the Eggplant starter which is done in olive oil (however way they do it) and comes with their (grilled?) lavash style bread for dipping. Sooo tasty! Will come back over and over!"}
{"text":"Saw Zaytoon driving home one day and put it on the list of things to try.  My only regret is I didn't try this place sooner!  I had the Lamb Kabob Wrap and my girlfriend had the Beef Kabob plate.  The lamb was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and complimented by the fresh cucumber sauce.  The rice that came with the Beef plate was fragrent and fresh.  Much better than the crunchy crappy rice I've recieved at similar joints around the valley.  

The owner was probably the most polite person I've met working at a restaurant.  You could really tell he loved what he was doing and it shows in his food and business."}
{"text":"Best chicken kabob I have had ! Even better than persian room ! Also prices are better and portions are good! cashier Setareh was very nice and helpful! The food got ready really quick too."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our visit to the ZK Grill. The service was great.  There was only one young man serving both the take out and restaurant customers. He started by explaining the various dishes to us, as we had never been to a Persian restaurant. His great service continue throughout the meal.
We started with the hummus, pita and cucumbers. The hummus was very smooth and tasty. The chicken was very flavorful and the rice was good as well. The portions were very generous and we brought home leftovers. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Tasty and timely, best to call ahead with your order. Be patient, the phone is always ringing there with orders!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I decided to go back after the first visit. Please dont support a restaurant that upcharges you $2 to substitute rice instead of fries. Cmon now.  Ridiculous. Also go check out Kyhber halal up the street insetad,"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is really good!  It compares BETTER than our other regular spot in Tempe, Haji Baba.  Nice friendly service and great food.  It's a small casual place, nothing too fancy."}
{"text":"I have previously eaten at ZK Grill but last week was horrible. The service by the counter help was atrocious. We were charged $2 more than the calculated total and were not given a receipt or explanation. The salad was old and wilted. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"We shared a chicken and filet mignon combo. The meat was very flavorful and tender. The rice was ample and the yogurt cucumber dip was a perfect compliment to the meal. 

Usually when you order a kabob meal at a restaurant it automatically comes with yogurt dip, bread and a roasted tomato. Here each item is separate. I dislike that type of nickel and dime tactic. Otherwise, it was very good. 

Ambiance is meh. Just a room with tables and chairs."}
{"text":"I have always like this place and now this location is finally open.  It opened a week ago and I still love the food!  While the combo plates might be priced a little high for some people, I think it is worth the quality and the quantity of the food.  I had the filet and lamb kabob combo with rice and greek salad.  My GF had the chicken kabob and filet combo with \"all salad\" as her side.  These combos are $13.99 each, but I think worth the price.  If you like this type of food, I think you will like this place."}
{"text":"Got the groupon deal $10 for $20 worth of food and was craving Middle Eastern/Meditteranean cuisine.  Came in and was warmly greeted by Fatima? at the counter who seemed to be very friendly with all the customers and was a great hostess.  I got the falafel appetizer which came with 3 falafels and a pita along with onions, tomatoes, etc. and the gyro plate combo which was a big portion that came with rice and was seasoned right along with some delicious french fries.  Got a baklava for dessert as well, but it wasn't that great and tasted pre-packaged with huge chucks of sugar cubes at the bottom of the box which ruined the flavor.

*Only drawback is they play classical music...as stereotypical as it is, I was NOT expecting this and was hoping for the typical belly dancer, yalla habibi type music which they did not play :(

Lots of delicious food, got half packed for home and made for great leftovers too, will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and tasty. I like their chicken wraps. The baklava is also tasty. The restaurant is clean and personal."}
{"text":"I was looking for something different for dinner and the \"fresh grill\" sign caught my attention. I absolutely love middle eastern cooking so was excited to see this place. This is a fast food restaurant however the food is cooked fresh to order. I decided to go with the gyro plate with rice and salad. In about 10 minutes, I was served this very generous plate of tons of gyro meat, tzatziki sauce, hot seasoned fluffy white rice and salad. Everything was absolutely delicious. Service was warm and friendly. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Below Average was our first and last experience. Monthly we got take out from My Big Fat Greek before it closed.  The last 2 years it had very spotty quality control but it's the bar we use to rate our attempts to replace it.  Family of 4 with take out all had same opinion. It felt like a McDonalds knock-off compared to In-N-Out.  It's a cheap to-go interior but who cares if it has great food, right? I'd never complain about Carolina's Mexican...  We like greek food for the Gyro meat and were disappointed. Our two $11 each Gyro greek salads (an entree) were ruined by canned black olives instead of kalamata and soggy-ish soft gyro meat. One of our diners threw it away and ate something else from our fridge. Same almost-mushy gyro in the gyro wrap, and not much of it either. The chicken wrap was ok. We've driven by this place for years and wondered.  Now we know. So sad since we don't have many great average-priced food options around here."}
{"text":"Best Persian food in the valley, We ordered Beef Kabob for 25 people, we were extremely pleased and our guests were delighted. The food was tasteful and perfect with great presentation."}
{"text":"I placed an order 2 hours before I come. When got there the girl told me we ran out of ground beef!!! Why would you take my order and say ok then??? She didnt even apologize! Horrible staff"}
{"text":"Subpar greeting and service first time they're terrible first impression we attempted to order 3 different items on the menu each time being told that they were out of that item basically leaving us with ground beef and chicken which i could go to any restaurant and gekeep in mind this was only 6pm on a Friday.  I came here because I wanted quality Mediterranean food which they could not provide I keep my business in Gilbert AZ that is my community and like to support local small business this place will not be getting any of my business nor recommendations we did happen to go 1 mile away and find a wonderful place called flaming kabob with the most incredible service and even better food I HIGHLY do not recommend going here as it is a complete waste of time"}
{"text":"The service is always pleasant and the food is always fresh. Not my favorite tabbouleh or hummus but the kabobs and rice are tasty as is the gormeh sabzi. Anytime you need a quick kabob fix this place does it."}
{"text":"Barely a two star experience. I was in the neighborhood with my girlfriend on a Thursday night and wanted to give it a try. 

On first impression, I thought that the place had potential. The menu looked good and seemed priced right. The place has all the ambiance of a Little Caesars take-out lobby, though. I had a chicken kabob plate, while she had a ground beef plate. We started with hummus. The food was just OK. Actually, pretty bland. 

Here's the problem: they nickle and dime for everything everything. A big think of hummus come with ONE pita. The plates didn't come with sauce. Portions were damn small. What looked like an  under $10 per person meal ended up almost forty bucks."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after getting my iPhone fixed next door. It is counter service and not a full service sit down. I ordered the Greek salad with chicken. Friendly service and the salad came out quickly and it was huge! I could eat the other half for dinner. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Zaytoon, but I agree with some of the negative posters who say they \"nickel and dime\" you to death. I believe that when you pay that much for hummus, you ought to get two pieces of bread (c'mon, who can eat a tub of hummus with only one pita?). Also, substitute rice and there should be no up-charge and so on. One day I went in and ordered and I was in a hurry, and the counter girl said the cook had some personal errands and would be back in awhile. I couldn't wait, so I left.

Outside of these strange aspects of their business, the food they serve is quite good. I like the ground beef Kabob, which is $2.50 a skewer, a fair price and it tastes good. Once they told me \"only Iranians like that dish\" and asked me if I was Persian! Anyway, no matter who likes it, I do -- it has a delicious spice in it. Also, the chicken skewers are spiced just right. Personally, I like their hummus, the one with Olives in it. Really, really good hummus."}
{"text":"ZK Grill was a find for me. 

I started off next door at WhereUBean Coffee, thinking I was done and decided to stop in here for something to take back to the office for later. I'm very glad I did 

Whenever I see the word Halal, I know I'm in for a tasty, well prepared Middle Eastern/ Mediterranean treat. 

You see the word Hal?l (Arabic:  al?l) means \"permissible\". Sort of like \"Circle K\" for kosher. So you know some extra effort has been made in its preparation. Nice!

ZK Grill's menu is extensive, see photo. Since I wasn't starving, with Mocha in hand, I ordered the #4 Gyro Wrap for $7.99, while skipping the Greek Salad that came with it. It was tasty, fresh, moist and very good. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yummy food...check out the ground beef kabob with half rice and half salad with a tomato, but the service is actually pretty rude...not sure why!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff.Very friendly. If someone knows anything about Persian food would say this is below average quality. sub standard service and very overprice. If you ate at the Persian Rooms or Pars, you are not going to like this. If those two are Mercedes, Zaytoon Kabob is a KIA. I will be generous and give it a 2 out of 5."}
{"text":"I'm baffled at the outstanding reviews.  Had delivery and thought I received something other than chicken.  The supposed kabobs were disgusting, did not recognize them as chicken kabobs.   Rice was fluffy, inviting and absolutely tasteless.   Greek salad was good.  My $40 meal will be a feast for my dogs.  Is this Mediterranean or Persian?   Maybe that's my issue.  Thought I ordered Mediterranean.....   Wow!"}
{"text":"This place was really reasonable and very good!  I so wish a Zaytoon was in my neighborhood.  The ground beef kabob platter was delicious - the meat was flavorful, the rice was just right and the tomato and pita were the perfect compliment to the meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place for dinner a few nights ago.  I wasn't expecting anything great but I was pleasantly surprised.  The staff was friendly, helpful and our order was ready pretty quickly.  Everything I tried was fresh and flavorful.  I would highly recommend this place to any Mediterranean food fan.

*Greek Salad = this was really just ok and nothing special.  Big Fat Greek has them on this one.

*Pitas = these were simply excellent!  Freshly made and delicious.

*Eggplant = very unique and flavorful.  Perfect with the pitas.

*Hummus = fresh and excellent.  Also perfect with the pitas.

We also tried 4 kabobs.  Lamb, chicken, filet and ground beef.  While they were all perfectly cooked, very juicy and flavorful; we enjoyed the ground beef one the best.

While the prices aren't wildly crazy for what you get, I do think the kabobs are a buck or 2 too high if you want to order them by themselves without the rice n' stuff.

Anyway, I really really enjoyed my dinner and would come back here anytime."}
{"text":"Interesting that this is a small chain.  This location has a 4 star rating and the Chandler Blvd. and 16th St. locations have only 3 1/2 stars.

I wanted to hate this place after ordering.  I thought the prices were quite high for a counter service middle eastern style restaurant.  It took FOREVER to get our food and I was so hungry.  I was close to asking for my money back and leaving.

Then the food came.  My girls loved the stuffed grape leaves.  The falafel wasn't the best ever but it was pretty good.  My husband ate all of his chicken and rice and salad.  The eggplant dip was what really shocked me.  I wasn't sure I liked it with the cream sauce on top but the more I ate the more I loved it.  The flatbread was good also.

I likely won't go back as I just adore Haji Baba (Tempe) when I am in the mood for this type of food but it wasn't bad if you are in the area."}
{"text":"After the 2nd time, we know it's for real. Excellent Persian food and excellent service. Don't let the strip mall, casual environment fool you, the food is good."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre! I ordered the lamb and it was dry and not a lot of flavor. I was disappointed. 

My husbands dish was ok. The gyro meat he ordered was also dry and not a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"Amazing! Portions are enough to share, everything is super fresh and the meat was tender and juicy."}
{"text":"Vegetarians can usually get a good meal at Middle Eastern restaruants.  Not at ZKB.  The hummus and falafel were just awful."}
{"text":"We just had dinner at Zaytoon and it was wonderful. 

We sampled the chicken, lamb, and filet kabobs. All of which were perfectly cooked and delicious. You can tell that the meats and produce used are top notch. The tandoori bread was fresh, light, and scrumptious. We also tried the baklava which was a perfect ending to our meal. 

I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is an update to my former review - and long overdue.  My initial review was on 2/2/2015 following our first visit to ZK Grill (also known as Zaytoon Kabob Bistro) and I only gave it 2-stars, not because the food was bad but the place was really dirty.

Several weeks following my review I received a direct email from their management through Yelp with a very generous offer for us to return and give them another try.  They explained that during that time period they were in the process of remodeling their entire restaurant, with the work taking place during the evenings, but still trying to stay open during business hours.  While it was a gracious offer, and one that showed a lot of class - not only in the offer but what was said in the email - my wife still wasn't enthusiastic about returning.  But we did several months later.

When we walked in it didn't look like the same place.  It was still in the same strip mall, but it had undergone a \"significant\" remodel.  I've included several photos so you can see for yourself.  Compare these photos to all the previous photos posted on Yelp (not only their location, but their food).  It was a slightly different layout, but with new floors, tables, counter, menu display, and now food was served on white plates with silverware, no more plastic stuff.  We still ordered from the counter and our food was delivered to us after we sat down.

The food, while good during our first visit, was even better.  I've been back at least a dozen times since, occasionally I took photos when I remembered to take my camera.  While we've tried \"most\" of their offerings, we've never tried any of their desserts because their portions are so large we can never finish them.  I've never gotten through more than half of any of their plates; always taking the rest home.  [Note: Their Combination Platter is excellent.]

Despite good food and the remodel, what my wife and I have constantly been impressed with is their service.  They usually only have one person working the counter, who also delivers the food to the tables and walks around to help customers, but they are all very good.  We particularly like three of the young lady's that work there, all three are sisters.

I am very appreciative to their management for making such a generous offer.  We've eaten at much higher scale places that haven't shown this amount of class.  As a result of this offer, and our experience, ZK Grill has become one of our \"go-to\" places, which is good for us because it's located very close to where we live.

I won't go into describing the various menu offerings we've had; I'll let the photos do the talking."}
{"text":"Best chicken I ever try ... I had chicken with half rice and half salad omg amazing  . They have the best ice cream you you should try it I will go back fo sure"}
{"text":"Best food ever I love the chicken with rice and salad I usually eat here every other day . Ground beef kebab is very good and flavorful ."}
{"text":"This place is amazing I eat here at least 3 to 4 times a week everything is great my favorite is ground beff and filet combo its amazing Champagne dressing is the best"}
{"text":"It's got all the personality of a subway restaurant, and the staff seems clueless, but they do grill them some mean kabobs.

The meat is the central item here.  Everything else is just fair.  The rice is fair, the pitta is like you tore into a package of pita bread from trader joes.  

I had stuffed grape leaves too which were seved hot, and tasted off as a result.  I've never had hot grape leaves.

Anyway, back to the meat.  Had the lamp, perfectly grilled medium, tasted outstanding.  

BUT, the star of the show was the chicken.  It's perfectly marinated in some yellow curry, which you can barely taste when cooked, but it's lean, juicy... just good.

I think if I was going back I would just get either the chicken entree or the lamb sandwich.  I think the entree lacks sauce... which would make it much better.

Anyway, I'll be back for a cheap, good pile of grilled meat.  I'll just skip all the sides."}
{"text":"The humus was delicious! As was the lamb/chicken meal!  Such a large helping,  I will have leftovers for tomorrow!  So yummy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area for an appointment so when we finished, we decided to grab a bite somewhere close because we were super hungry. When I checked Yelp, ZK was very close and it had excellent reviews do we decided to try it. 

It was about 2:30pm when we showed up. The restaurant was empty. We placed our order at the cashier and picked a table. We ordered the combo dishes, the beef and lamb combo and the lamb and chicken combo. In about 10 min, the food was out. The dishes looked great and they were hot and fresh and the portion size was huge! 

Everything tastes very good. I say very good bcz I have tried other Persian places in the valley and I have my favorite and it remains my favorite because the seasoning in the other restaurant is just spot on! The food here was also pretty good but to me, it was lacking a little bit more seasoning. This said however, the portion is huge in comparison to the price so that's the advantage here. 

I may be visiting the restaurant again if I am in the area. Good food, good prices and service overall. Worth trying for sure."}
{"text":"I love this place 
There are so many mediterranean restaurants but this one is the best 
First they are never to busy ( I hope for them they will be one day ) so everything come out fast 
The service is nice and the food is the BEST 
They don't charge much for such a big portion
Every single item is good ( maybe the falafel is not ) so no meter what you will order I think it's a win 
Enjoy"}
{"text":"Being a Persian, it is difficult to find good Persian food in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area unless I am eating a home-cooked meal or at the nearby Persian Room. 

We had heard some of our family friends (who are also Persian) raving about this new almost \"fast food\" type of Persian food restaurant where you can get good and affordable Persian classics like ghormeh sabzi (vegetable and meat stew)  and khashke-badamjan (eggplant side dish) , so we decided to give it a try. 

When we walked in the place was completely empty. We went up to order, and god the standard kabob and rice plate, with some most-au-moussir (shallot and yogurt dip), pitas, and drinks. 

upon ordering we took a seat, in a pant ,with the cheap laminate booths and tacky fans on overhead.  But hey, who knows, some of the best places to eat are in dive-y looking places so, we werent that turned away. 

Then we got the food. The Kabob was so overcooked that it was chewy and charred, which in Persian cuisine is the least from appetizing. The most-au-moussir was literally just liked sour cream. I didnt taste one shallot in it, the consistency was overly thick and it tasted like it was made from a sour cream base instead of a plain yogurt base-- lucky for me i like sour cream so i ate it. . The rice was okay. It wasnt salted or seasoned at all, but it was fluffly and tasted alright when salt was added to it. 

Service was below par, and the only interaction we had with any employee as when they took our order and our money. One member of our group got food poisoning the same night. Probably from Zaytoon, but I'm not one of those snooty restaruant goers that blames every bodily episode on bad food. 

Overall, i wont be returning to zaytoon unless it is absolutely necessary. Which, will probably be never"}
{"text":"Wife and I always enjoy the food and have visited their restaurant often.  Today, however, we were extremely disappointed with their service.  A young man appeared to be in charge and was more concerned with chatting with young women rather than attending to the line of customers.  Felt like a high school cafeteria.   After a long wait we left and went next door to Streets of NY.   I hope they improve their customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Thursday night for a quick bite to eat in my car while my kid is at soccer practice. It's your basic local business restaurant, 2 man operation and working for themselves......respect.
I just ordered a chicken Caesar salad to go.  It's always a guess what it's going to look like when you open it.
Is there enough chicken..........YES
Is the to go box completely filled.......YES
Will there be enough dressing.......YES
Did they give me free baklava.........No (maybe next time)

My salad was a A+, maybe next Thursday I'll try some gyro meat and salad!!"}
{"text":"The service is good but the food quality has gone bad, way bad! The kebab was brought to my table raw and it wasnt done well! When i asked for replacement they brought a new one almost the same! I guess that they just have them all made frozen and they just microwave them"}
{"text":"Was excited to go back... Not sure if ownership changed w name... But tried camelback location and original since 1st review... Just NOT the same.  Sad was so amazing... Disappointing when not consistent"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Persian takeout.  The eggplant dip is awesome and I love their beef and chicken kubideh.  Everything is made fresh here, and its an ideal place to call in an order for a movie night at home.  Don't forget to ask for some sumac powder to add that sour salty flavor to the meat!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Certainly on par with some of the better \"kebob\" places in town. I only say four stars because there is a place I like better. If this is close to you, I'd recommend it - and check groupon! Seemed a little empty when we stopped in, but I eat later than most."}
{"text":"They have Best food, good customer service, and good price. My favorite food is beef combo, it's so juicy and testy. It's best Persian food in Arizona."}
{"text":"Well I can say I am a frequent diner and very happy to say I will continue to eat here again. For a while I had been passing by now wishing i would have taken a chance on dropping in sooner. Groupon is what sold me. I got a killer meal deal which drove me to come in. I am surprised by the reviews as I have not had anything but great experience every time I have visit this location along with quality food. I don't eat Shrimp or Lamb so my reviews are on everything else. The meat is seasoned very well. The salad is amazing. It is not your typical mixed green salad they actually make it pretty loading it with the color veggies that make a mixed green salad taste well. I typically just eat there Champagne Vinegarate but they offer many other salad dressings. Along with the grilled tomato and pita bread make the meal even more enjoyable. 

My last order was #19 the Chicken Kaboob Meal. This was Grilled Chicken, Rice, Salad, Pita Bread and a Grilled Tomato. Everything was perfect. Fresh flavorful and hot. They cook everything to order so be prepared to wait at least 15 mins but it is worth it for good food.

All the staff on deck are welcoming. It is a small little place with plenty of seating. Stop on in grab a drink and be prepared to enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is the Best Home made Persian Food in Arizona. My favorite dish is the mix grill Chicken koobideh \"Ground beef\"combo with Rice and salad. Everything on the menu is so delicious. I would eat this everyday if this place opened up down the street from my house.
It's a good 25 min drive to get some awesome Persian food from where I live but it's so worth it. The staff is very nice and the service is Fantastic. If your ever in the neighborhood  show some support and Please stop by and Try this Great Restaurant . I would highly recommend it to all my Friends and Family."}
{"text":"This place is a well kept secret. The food is always made fresh, with fresh ingredients. The staff are very friendly and polite. And it's great value for the money. I highly recommend this place for Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Seemed to have changed hands, food was dynamite before for a little small restaurant in a strip mall.  Now just okay...something has changed for sure.  If I'm in the area I'll stop in but will not go out of my way like before."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times. It's by my work and convenient to pick up a gyro (which is actually really good) I called ahead to pick up my order and they made the wrong food for me. Instead of the gyro wrap they gave me a beef wrap which is ground beef and honestly doesn't compare to there gyro meat. They wouldn't make my correct order or accommodate me in any way. Very poor service"}
{"text":"If you have ever eaten Mediterranean food you would not be impressed. Chicken shawarma was dry and the seasonings were awful. It was empty on a Saturday night. Never again"}
{"text":"My wife and I both ordered the #12, beef/chicken dinner. We've both had a lot of Persian food over the years, and I have to say this is as good as any I've ever had. The chicken was moist and full of flavor and the beef, the beef! Just wow! Champagne vinaigrette finished off the salad and the saffron rice was saffron rice. 

The restaurant is located in a strip mall, but don't let the location deceive you, the food is great."}
{"text":"I gave them 5 stars before, but it kind of bothers me that they give you a little Dixie cup if you ask for water while dining in. Their food  is still good, but if we are trying to eat healthy, why would we want soda?"}
{"text":"Mike & Parissa, co-owners of ZK Grill, catered our wedding party for 35 people in late December 2014.  We ordered Chicken Kabobs, Dolmas, Beef Filet Kabobs, Eggplant, Saffron Rice, Broiled Tomato, Mixed Salad & Pitas.  Nearly every guest commented to my wife and I on the delicious food and wonderful presentation.  We were very particular about the catering details and Mike & Parrisa could not have been more cordial and accommodative.  We could not have been more pleased with the outcome.  Do not be put off by the meager storefront appearance; this food is some of the best Persian food in town and the catering was magnificent.  Highly-recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! The Best AMAZING salads!!! Also The was they do the chicken is SO good. Best salad I have had here in AZ since we moved here 18 mos ago. You get a huge salad for a really great price. The people that work here are really nice as well. We excited to try other stuff off the menu. (Terra)"}
{"text":"Really good food. Sometimes it takes a while if you order. And it's kind of pricey but very good nothing take the ice cream is outstanding"}
{"text":"The grilled chicken and gyro meat is delicious.  The eggplant was not at all to my liking, very oily, do not recommend.  It sometimes takes a while to get the food, we've had to wait....."}
{"text":"Best Kabob Kobideh ever..Food was amazing!!! I was really surprised with the food quality and price. I used to go to places like Persian Room which is pretty good but this place' kabobs are way better. The guy who was serving us was very welcoming and supportive. I was really looking for a place with a good Kabob Kobideh and wasn't able to find it in Arizona until I found this place. Totally recommendable...."}
{"text":"Although they have changed their name they havent changed the qualityof the food. One of my fav places to eat..."}
{"text":"The food is always good here, their chicken is the best. The way they marinate it it's so good you won't find it else where. Also recently the place looks cleaner and I see more ambience which is I think because of new management. Ali is always nice to us whenever we go there and feed us with their yummy food. definitely recommend zk grill."}
{"text":"Don't miss the saffron ice cream!

OK, now that dessert has been covered, I'll finish my review.

I went to Zaytoon this afternoon with my 10year old.  I've tried to talk my family into going here on a couple occasions, but get the usual resistance you might expect from a couple teenagers. With only one person to convince/coerce, I got my way.

We kept it very simple- we shared a gyros, side of tabbouleh, and that amazing ice cream.

As it was around noon on Sunday, place was a little quiet.  Pleasant and clean, order taken at counter and ready very fast.   The bread was more tandoori/naan like than pita, and the gyro had good fresh veggies on it.  The tsatsiki was very good and fresh, and their tabbouleh was also excellent.  The bread was awesome, somewhat chewy, crisp.

There was plenty of food there, and the two of us shared no problem.  

The owner of the establishment checked on us to ensure we were enjoying our meal.  

They held our ice cream until we were almost finished, and then the girl brought it to us, with two spoons, two more napkins, etc.  

Aaahh, the Saffron Ice Cream!  Bright yellow, with a hint of rosewater, and pistachios throughout.  Sublime.

My daughter enjoyed all of the foods, including the cracked olives and tabbouleh.   We talked about making an ice cream birthday cake with Saffron Ice Cream.  Warms my heart to see a kid try the unfamiliar!  Good times.

The potential for excellent Middle Eastern food is definitely here.  I am heading back to try their daily dinner specials!"}
{"text":"In the mood for Mediterranean food?  Look no further, Zaytoon Kabob Bistro is what you are looking for!  Upon entering, you are greeted immediately by their cashier.  At the cashier area, one can select from their abundant menu and then have your food brought to your table.  Their restaurant has open and ample seating for dining.

Zaytoon uses the freshest of ingredients.  Their menu boasts starters dishes (i.e. hummus), salad, entrees of gyros and/or kabobs, and their Zaytoon Wraps.  On this particular day, I tried their chicken kabob entree ($6.99) which includes one skewer of chicken over pita, side salad, and rice.

Their chicken kabob brings forth a juicy and delicious meal.  Their taste is evidence of Zaytoon's practice of marinating and skewering their kabobs on a daily basis.  To go a step further, Zaytoon uses stainless steel skewers that holds the juices, which make for a moist and juicy kabob.  The side salad evens the meal out, along with a healthy portion of their basmati rice.

Filling, delicious and most health conscious, one can eat like a king at Zaytoon.  Food created with attention to detail and reasonable prices, check out Zaytoon Kabob Bistro today!"}
{"text":"A solid and hearty Mediterranean lunch  that is slightly lighter, different, and tastier than its typical Kronos cousins."}
{"text":"There have been complaints about cleanliness and food quality from people I trust, which leads me to believe that ZK can be inconsistent. However, I have only had positive experiences here. It is good quality Persian food for a fast casual restaurant. I usually order the beef combo. For those saying that the rice is dry, you are supposed to add the butter that they provide. The portions are pretty good--not for two people as some suggest--but for one of me."}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting 

I really dislike giving a restaurant a less then favorable review when the reviews are mostly positive.  So let's start this review on a positive note. The service at ZK Grill is great.  The staff is accomadating, friendly, without being intrusive.  However, for me the food was below average.

Today my lunch companion and I had the Chicken Entrée for lunch.  Our entrée consisted of Chicken, salad, rice, and a roasted tomato. If you like rice this dish has plenty of it.  In fact, you will  receive a very generous portion  of rice with your meal, even when choosing the 1/2 rice, 1/2 salad option however, if it's protein you're yearning for, you will be disappointed.

Our entrée had five chunks of chicken that were extremely challenging to cut.  The chicken was over cooked, dry, and lacked flavor. The chicken was difficult to eat and to be honest after two pieces I had enough.

The roasted tomato had an odd taste that is hard to describe.  It really was very bland and seemed to be over cooked. The salad consisted soley of iceberg lettuce and onions with a small cup of salad dressing. However, I did finish my salad because I did not like the rice, as it lacked any flavor.

The overall meal just wasn't very good and not what I expected."}
{"text":"Excellent food ...
Try the Yogurt with shallot dip
The tabbouleh was great though the quantity was less..
The chicken kabob was fantastic and so was the gyro
They also give you sumac powder on the table (besides the salt shaker) incase you want to zest up your food a lil more.


Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite places to eat in the east valley. ZK is a family ran hole-in-the-wall that serves up some of the best Persian/Middle Eastern food I've ever had. I have been coming here for almost a year now, and every time I come in, it's the same friendly faces greeting us at the register. I always get a combo, usually the beef and lamb or beef and filet- they are always cooked perfectly and so delicious. I've also had the chicken, and it's also always amazing. They also seem to back the blue community, which is another plus in my book. I'll be coming back for years to come."}
{"text":"Just tried to place a pick up order and I had a few questions, the gal on the phone (Ella) told me I was wasting her time. So I decided to go to Saba's instead. Heard Eden's was really good too! Bad customer service = no business."}
{"text":"Zaytoon is as good as it gets.  A buddy and I have Thursday night where we get takeout and watch a bad movie.  Zaytoon has made Thursday my favorite night of the week.

The fillet and beef kabobs are on a whole other level.

The staff is great too.  Our orders are always taken down just right and the food never takes too long.  Extremely friendly.

Can not recommend them enough."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely fabulous! I had the chicken entree. It's just slightly priced over what I really would want to pay for the size of a dish but the chicken was extremely flavorful and juicy so that makes it completely worth it. I really enjoyed the yogurt cucumber dip but I can see how someone might not. It's pretty heavy on the dill so if you don't like that favor stay away from it. 

The restaurant is set up a little odd. Apparently, it is table service but reads much more like counter service at a fast food place. Mainly, because there is a menu billboard above the counter which is in the center of the restaurant instead of the entrance. 

The cashier/waitress who was there when I stopped by definitely tries super hard to \"sweet\" talk customers for tips. It can be a bit much. Personally, I prefer a much more sincere and tailored to each customer approach for tips instead nice, repetitive, robot but whatever works.  

There isn't much atmosphere to the restaurant so I'll definitely be back but for take out and not dine in in the future."}
{"text":"Great food and lots of it, you can occasionally get groupons for cheap, and the prices are excellent."}
{"text":"Walked here for early dinner while our car was at the dealer. 
Sahar made us feel at home, she was really nice and friendly (patient too as we took a while to decide). 
Hubby had the gyro wrap with fries and a drink. I had the Greek salad plus a ground beef skewer.  Everything was very tasty and the salad was crisp and fresh. Actually the salad was massive. The fries portion was very generous too. 
The sumac was really good (red spice for the meat). We will make this our mandatory stop every time our car needs service!"}
{"text":"We like the food at this place, everything seems so fresh.
We had wraps (gyro and beef skewer). They come with fries or salad, we chose fries and ordered a shirazi salad side. We also got the stuffed grape leaves and they were delicious! They come in a plate with a pita, cucumbers, and yogurt dip. They were warm... I think I never had warm dolmeh but it was really good.

My beef skewer was not as tasty as usual, I do not know if it needed salt, spices or something, but it was not as good.

Everything else was great. Doogh was good but we still miss the home made one : ("}
{"text":"LOVED IT. 

I got the Beef and Lamb combo. It was #13 I believe?

They give you so much food and more than just the quantity and fairness of the price, more importantly, it was very delicious! 

The beef wasn't what I was expecting because it was ground beef but was still good. However, the lamb was perfectly cooked and it was amazing.

The service was great as well!

I will definitely go back to try the other dishes. :)"}
{"text":"Great, fresh food.  Spotless environment.  Friendly staff.  The hummus rocks."}
{"text":"Yum! The chicken and rice is delicious! Chicken had good spices and wasn't over cooked. Classic Kabobs at a good price. The owner came over and chatted with us for a little bit too. Nice people."}
{"text":"The Falafel wrap,Gyro and Hummus were excellent! We'll definitely be going again soon."}
{"text":"Tasty $7.99 Lunch Wraps With Big Salad

Good sized menu with pictures to choose your nourishment...

The chicken shawarma wrap was good and it was packed with food. 

The Salad was pretty large and when I was done I was nicely filed and my hunger had abandoned me.

The service was professional, no extra chatting, just business... When we left we were giving a polite have nice day...

PS: I didn't know where to put the plates after I cleaned them off since there was a flower on top of the garbage can where trays and plates would normally go. So we left them on the table."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat ZK quite often - in fact, we just ordered from here last night and it reminded me to leave a review that is long overdue. I wish I could give a rundown of all their entrees and appetizers, but sadly, we both only order the same two items EVERY time (I know, how boring) but we just love how good it tastes! Chicken kabob and lamb combination plate with a mix of rice and salad (and two orders of baklava with a yogurt drink) and MMMMMM we are in heaven! That order comes out to $40, so it's not really cheap but the quality is fantastic AND they serve you A LOT of food (6 pieces of each meat, a big bowl of salad and most likely 2 cups of rice.) 

The only thing that irritates us is how they charge for the tzatziki sauce... 75 cents for a small serving. You have to pay for this because they don't serve any sauce with the entree, so it's a minor annoyance but we just suck it up because the food is great.

Also, if you're ordering in, your food is finished very quickly - 15 minutes tops. It doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but when you're hungry and you're rushing home to watch your new favorite show... you seriously appreciate it."}
{"text":"Simple food done very well!  The chicken kabobs and rice are delicious!  I order from here at least once a week.  Everything tastes very fresh and delicious, and the service is friendly.

The chicken kebabs w/ half rice and half salad is delicious.  They give you TONS of rice, and the chicken is perfectly seasoned.

I do not recommend the Pomegranate chicken - sounds good but was highly disappointed.  

Huge portions, great prices, and customer service very friendly."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good.  Lackluster in ambiance.  I think the food is pricey... $27 for hummus, water, Greek chicken salad and gyro.  The person working was attentive but not friendly.  Probably won't be returning.  There's a place in Chandler which I prefer."}
{"text":"I had their beef kabob platter tonight for dinner. I must say I was very pleasantly surprised!  It rivaled food you get in most Persian restaurants. My wife had the lamb and beef combo and it was very good. It's an unassuming place where a lot of people get take out although you could also eat there if you wanted to. Friendly staff. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Persian food and having this place close to home is awesome.

The owners are very friendly and they have a lot of seating. Yes it's more self service place but it's very clean and he food is done very well."}
{"text":"It was my first time there. I ordered by phone on Yelp on my way home from work as I pass it every day. I've been trying different Mediterranean restaurants to see which ones are ones I'd like to go to and take others. ZK is going to be one of my Med restaurants I will be going to more regularly.You can't beat the price for the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Was a little skepitcal when we first arrived due to no other customers in the restaurant, and there was a bit of a wait for the food. It was worth the wait as the food was fantastic! Much more authentic than other greek places that we've tried. Hubby said the gyro meat was the best he's ever had, and the rice was tasty too. Portion was huge. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING WARNING ... DO NOT EAT HERE! Just ate here yesterday and all three of us got food poisoning. I will be reporting this to the health department as well but wanted to warn anyone considering this establishment. All three of us ordered different items yet we all had the same outcome. Most likely the oil they cook with went bad or the meats were all compromised."}
{"text":"Very satisfied. I had beef and chicken with half rice and salad plus roasted tomato. It was delicious and the portions were gigantic.  Used a Groupon but I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times, but this time was terrible. I believe they are under new management. So, I walk in and say hello to the cook who is looking directly at me. He says nothing. I repeat myself and the same thing. He spoke English, because he proceeded to converse with the girl who was taking the orders. I believe his intention was to be rude. Also they have heightened the counters which block the view of what's going on when they're preparing your food. Needless to say I didn't feel comfortable with this especially with a sketchy individual cooking. From now on I'll go to Z's Greek on Indian School. They are courteous and the food is better... Try this place at your own risk..."}
{"text":"Fantastic Persian food and fantastic service! There were some pros and cons of ZK, but I'm glad that I gave it a try. It is kind of in a random location, in a little area you can see from the street, easy to find! There weren't many people when we went on a Friday night which was nice, I think a lot of people were getting takeout.
Major props to the guy behind the counter, he was rockin it. He had takeout orders, was answering calls, serving people, and cleaning the tables. He still made time to talk to us and tell us about the menu! Answer our questions about the menu items we were unsure about, and apologized for being so busy. Poor guy had to do everything by himself!
I decided on the falafel wrap and got hummus to start as well. My mom got a chicken platter. The hummus was really smooth and tasty! I had some of my moms rice too and loved it. This is obscure, but my favorite thing was the tzatziki sauce haha, it was a little lemony and tasted great with the falafel. The falafel was moist and flavorful. Only thing I did not like was the side salad, I think that is just because I'm not huge on romaine lettuce though. I wish I would've had the fries instead..this is what happens when you try to make healthier choices haha. But the champagne dressing was tasty. My mom liked her chicken too. We had food to bring home and left satisfied!"}
{"text":"Nice location. Worker was pleasant. I would give 3.5 if I could versus 4. Food was good. We both had wraps which came with plenty of meat. I had fries...coworker had salad,we were both happy with our selection."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, staff is great and friendly.  Lamb is outstanding, beef sublime, rice extra special, and desserts were much better than expected.  Gives Persian Room a rival that they will struggle to beat for the price.  Possible new hang out."}
{"text":"Food is great but no sauce for the meat, I don't know what's the right way to eat it but every time I order uber eats for this type of food I expected the sauce to come with it. It's OK if it's extra charge but plz put into the sides option with all the combo. When I see the menu I thought that's like extra sauce so I didn't buy it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Mediterranean food. 

I have been here a few times and have yet to be disappointed 

The chicken entree is very good and they give a large portion. 

My favorite is the chicken shwarma wrap, which has so much flavor that I could not put down.

I wish they would give more pita bread with the hummus

The employees are always very nice, can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"It is a small joint but the food was good.
You go in and order at the counter and if you dine in they will bring you your food.
The cashier was really nice and polite.
I had the chicken entree which was a large portion as I couldn't finish it. It tasted really well. 
Will go back"}
{"text":"There is nothing quite like Persian food;  it is complex, delicious and sometimes like nothing you've ever tasted.   Apart from dad's kitchen and sit-down places in Tempe and Scottsdale, there are limited places to find it in the Valley.  Do yourself a favor and don't order a gyro;  you can find one anywhere.  Order one of the daily specials at their crazy cheap prices for Persian food and enjoy!  I've had nearly all of them and they rock!  These dishes take all day to make; believe me I know and you can taste why.  And do not miss the saffron ice cream with rose water and pistachios."}
{"text":"Second day in a row for gyro place! Whoo! This place seems to have less variety than the place I went to yesterday (George's Famous Gyros), and the prices were a little more pricier as well. But the gyro wasn't bad at all. I also ordered the ground meat skewer which was pretty long. It was tasty as well. Good place for a quick bite in the Chandler area if you are looking for Mediterranean. My friend is a vegetarian so we came here but it looked like they only had 1 vegetarian dish unfortunately."}
{"text":"Happened to stop by ZK by chance. Glad I did. When I walked in I was gonna grab a menu and come back another time, but the young lady and man behind the counter were very friendly and talkative. They recommended the gyro. Wow. Seasoned perfectly and was packed so full of meat. I will def be returning soon. Thank you for the great experience."}
{"text":"Solid kabob fare, but holy $@%& does it smell unappealing in there.  It's kinda musty and stale. Did I mention the food is okay?"}
{"text":"Delicious, healthy food served quickly. Greek, Lebanese, and Persian classics. Fresh, nutritious, and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great Food.  Quick Service.  Fair Pricing.

also....  the owner (and staff) actually appear that they are happy you are there.

Good folks operating a nice lil' eatery."}
{"text":"I won't return. When I walked in the place lookgldepressing. I came because 2 new friends recommended it, so we ordered and waited. When she placed the eggplant starter on the table I cringed because it looked like dog food. I tasted a tiny and I didn't like it. I told the women but she didn't replace it or give my money back. My ice cream was awful and after we both tasted it I left it behind. The lamb wrap was okay."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The location is good, staffs are polite and the food is great. Ask for their Sultani Kabob. It is great"}
{"text":"Love the food here, I usually get the beef and chicken combo since I love both ! And I definitely go there every Thursday to get their Thursday special which is lamb shank with green rice."}
{"text":"First time at ZK grill tonight, went there on a recommendation of a co-worker and gotta say the food is very good! We stopped in around 7:30pm and they were out of lamb for the day so we ordered 2 beef combos... Like I said the food was good but not sure if they were having an off night (hey it happens) our order was to-go and we didn't think to check while still there (our bad) when we got home we realized we were missing the salad dressings and the grilled tomatoes, so bummed because I LOVE them. Also I wanted to try their saffron ice cream but they were also out... All in all we will definitely be going back but maybe just earlier in the day so they don't run out of stuff and will make sure to check our order before leaving."}
{"text":"Food is awesome very healthy and my husband loves it  great protein dish  the lady that works the front is very nice always greets you with a smile. But prepare to wait about 10 to 15 mins for your order.  Which is a good thing since you know it's fresh.  So order in advance if you don't have much time"}
{"text":"Cardioloogists might as well co brand with them to offer discounts. The grease in the grilled items is extreme! I think maybe I have been spolied by oter Persian Restaurants.

I think the spices are a little weak, and they are really not using the most quality ingrediients. Its not horrible by any means. I have a 2 year old that coming home one night said: \"Daddy, kababs please for yummy!\" So we decided to try it.

He had a few bites, and looked at me and said \"Other kababs\" referring to our other Persian resturant in town, and then asked for his milk. The rice wasnt bad. Nice and fluffy but instead of adding butter to the rice we got they simply provided us a packet of butter on top of the rice.

For the same price as a lunch at a full service restaurant,. you can get a full dinner but its a far cry from their Persian competitiion. Its basically a no frillls fast casual place. OK meal but not really one I am going to crave too often."}
{"text":"Really tasty food and pleasant service! Would definitely come back here for another meal. I got the mix lamb and beef combo. Was very delicious!"}
{"text":"Very yummy food, great service, the owner really cares about his customers and their wants/needs. Highly recommend for quality Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"Came to this place for lunch while visiting from California.  The place was full for 2:00 on a Saturday.  The cashier was very friendly and nice, explained the menu to us.  I got the chicken plate and my friend got the chicken and beef combo plate.  The portions are large, food was good.  The chicken didn't really have a lot of flavor but the rice more then made up for it.  The rice was cooked perfect not too soft not too hard, not sticky, just yum.  The only bad thing i can say about the place was when they cleaned our table they just wiped the food onto the floor and left it there.  Oh and the iced tea I got tasted spoiled.  It's an ok spot if you're looking for a quick bite with big portions."}
{"text":"Date of Visit:  11.29.16      See the review from Hector below - wish I had read that beforehand as I would not have visited.  Agree with his overall impression about the cleanliness - at first, it appears okay but when you start looking around, there are red flags - especially the fountain drink machine (gross)!  I ordered the #4 Gyro Wrap and was not impressed.  The gyro meat was very thick and had not taste - not sure how it was warmed as there was not a vertical spit being used like you see at most places that serve gyro's.  I opted for french fries instead of the salad - the fries were fresh/hot and the best part of the meal.  I should have known something was askew as it was lunch time and there were only one other customer.   The ceiling vents were very dirty, light fixtures had burnt bulbs, etc.  Brittanie was the cashier and she was very friendly which was a plus.  I would not recommend and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Newly remodeled!  So clean and nice!  And the food is splendid as usual!  We have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Best shawarma chicken I've ever had, chicken is full of flavor and very tender. Served on a salad or with a side salad and rice or in a Pita.  Salad and salad dressing is very excellent, I highly recommend the chicken salad rice combo. The inside of the place is definitely not assuring, but I've eaten here several times and I've always had a good experience."}
{"text":"If for no other reason, the service provided by the lady at lunch was enough. She could not have been nicer or more friendly to everyone.  I went on a recommendation to try the LAMB special.  It was very good, but I would have liked it better if it was 2 shanks instead of 1 and less rice and vegetables. But that's just me! The salad's at the next table looked excellent and I might just go again to try one."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! 
Started off with Dolma and Hummus. Both were absolutely delicious. Portions were large for appetizers and easy to share. 
Dinner was a falafel with side salad and chicken and rice with a side salad. Once again, large portions and great flavor. 
I was disappointed that the restaurant was not packed with people considering the great prices, flavorful food and exceptional service. 
This place is definitely deserving of multiple visits."}
{"text":"We wanted something quick, cheap, easy and relaxed practically like you don't have to be done up to dine there. ZK's grill is the perfect place for that! I came with my family with my gym clothes on and we ordered at the counter. My hubby and I ordered the beef and chicken platter with rice and a salad. The portions were perfect for the two of us. 

The flavor is really really good especially the chicken and rice. We also ordered baklava and it was delicious!!! The prices are inexpensive and I definitely see myself coming back when I'm craving Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"We walked from the nearby Holiday Inn Express to find this amazing gem of a restaurant. We ordered two combo meals (each of which includes a nice salad, a very well-prepared rice, and a wonderfully roasted tomato with perfectly/slightly crispy skin), one with chicken and one with lamb. The chicken is not to be dismissed as routine, as it was perfectly seasoned, moist and perfectly cooked: fantastic. The lamb was exceptional, such that the meat's flavor shined and the spices remained in a supporting role in the background (where they should be). The freshness and \"homemade\" quality of the meal cannot be overstated. It was truly amazing. Definitely order the \"Deezee\" (as written phonetically on the menu, but actually 'Dizi'), an elegant combination of lamb, garbanzos, potatoes, onion, and other amazing goodness that is stewed and served with pita and a subtle tomato-based sauce on the side. The Deezee is a meal in and of itself. I am a 210 lb 6'2\" tall man and I had trouble finishing my half of the Deezee and my lamb combo meal. The portions are large. As most food people know, the best places are often lacking on ambiance. This place is in a strip mall but it is a gem. All in all a fantastic meal. Obviously highly recommended."}
{"text":"We made another trip to ZK (formerly Zaytoon's).  The staff greeted us warmly and even remembered us from our last visit.  We ordered the chicken entree and the chicken/beef combo plates.  They will either give you rice with the meal or 1/2 rice and 1/2 salad.  We got the second choice and even then got a ton and rice with the order.  The chicken is cooked nicely as was the beef.  The salad greens are fresh and crisp.  We order our meal to go knowing that we can't eat the entire plate.  We highly recommend this place.  Nothing too fancy, prices are great and staff are nice.  We have tried the baklava in the past and that is good?  Crispy filo dough that is oh so flaky."}
{"text":"I'm a white girl that loves her Persian food!! Yummmmmm... And ZK Grill (formerly Zaytoon) has got it down!

The Food:
Let's start with the most important thing about a restaurant, the food. The food at ZK Grill is very fresh. The meat is always tender and delicious ( I particularly like the lamb). They have traditional Persian food like Koobideh, Hummus, and various Kabobs, They also have daily specials like Zereshk Polo with Chicken, Baghali Polo with Lamb Shank, and Ghormeh Sabzy. If you have never tried Persian food, then I would advise to start here. For first timers I usually suggest the Koobideh plate. It is a ground beef kabob with various spices with saffron basmati rice and a grilled tomato. You can also trade out the rice for a salad. If you also want dessert, you can never go wrong with the Saffron Ice Cream. With hints of saffron and rose water, this ice cream is a true treat.

Atmosphere:
They recently updated the décor and it looks nice. It's not too cramped, and it's always very clean. I have zero complaints about it's appearance.

Service:
The service here is always amazing. I have never once had an issue. No one is rude, ever. This is a place where you order your food at the counter, If you are dining in, they will happily bring the food to your table. I usually take my food to go, which is also very prompt. 

Conclusion:
I am giving ZK Grill 5 stars because the food is excellent, the service is wonderful, and the place is clean and spacious. I hope you enjoy ZK Grill as much as I have. :)"}
{"text":"We love Zaytoons and eat there often.  The food is good and consistent. Not a huge fan of the set up style of the place (order at the counter) but it's always clean and the staff is friendly. Our favorite is what we call Pomegranite Chicken Saturday which is the special of the day on saturdays.  It's delicious!  The food is authentic middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Did you always wonder what Persian food is all about and wanted to try this colorful and flavorful cuisine? Look no further, because at ZK grill you can try this, in the US rather exotic cuisine, without having to go to an actual \"fancy\" restaurant and pay a ton of money. 

ZK grill is more or less a fast food joint for Persian food but it is so much more than just fast food. They pretty much have a variety of national foods of Iran, and please don't hesitate to ask the manager for a recommendation or an explanation of the items. They will be more than happy to help you out. Also, if you are there, and you have never had basmati rice cooked Persian style, then don't leave this place until you tried it. It is the best. 

If you are a boring person and don't feel too brave, then they also have traditional gyros. But why go there to have gyros, right? P.S. Ask for saffron ice cream! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Best persian food in the valley so far. Fair prices and perfect quality. Delicious kabobs and stews."}
{"text":"Customer service was % on point! The food was tasty & satisfied my soul. An excellent post workout meal! Food was properly cooked and prepared. Healthy choice. The presentation of the dish, set the mood. Very clean."}
{"text":"Just placed an order for the barberry rice and chicken- picked up the food and found beef and plain rice. Not only did they give me the wrong food, bit charged me too & I can't even eat this. Totally disappointed. Called the lady and told her, she just said I have your number I will call you tomorrow. Wow, quite unprofessional. Not ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Gr8 place for lunch! I had the #17 (chicken Sharma ) delish!  Nice to have the food brought to the table."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. The chicken was succulent, the staff was friendly, and the price was right. I had the chicken entree with no expectation. I was very impressed. I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"This food was amazing their Gyro and jasmine rice hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I love this place the chicken is fresh the salads are fresh and crispy, you truly feel good after eating their meals. 
Been here 3 times. First two times had chicken shawarma and lives it both times. Third time decided to try a gyro. To my disappointment the gyro meat was not tasteful, some of the slices were dry must've been shaved from the end our outer part. The taste was somewhat similar to liver which I like but not in my gyro meat. The pita bread was not fresh and I had better tzaziki sauce before. 
I will come to this place again but will stick to only chicken dishes and no gyro meat. 

I came back today to order shwarma chicken using a Groupon. To my disappointment they have changed the way they serve the chicken. They do not serve nice chunks of grilled chicken but you get these strips of chicken that do not taste as good as they did before."}
{"text":"Kabob's are as good or better than other full service restaurants but much less expensive. The staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing place food is tasty. Portions are huge got number 23 beef and tikka man good stuff. Great friendly staff and fast service. Food is made fresh on grill. Rice and salad come with your plate."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this place. Friendly staff. Excellent menu. Always consistently perfect. Fresh and healthy! As good if not better than the Persian Room, but a more casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I can't believe I live a couple miles from here and didn't get around to trying it for 6 years.  The food here is fantastic and a remarkable value.  Any entrée here can easily feed two people.  The gyros are a great lunch option too.  The ground beef kebabs sound weird but they're awesome.  They take the beef, mix in spices and basically create a long meatball that's grilled up. 

They're available through Uber Eats and you can also order online for pickup with Yelp as well."}
{"text":"Sorry was not impressed - the food was bland and they were unwilling to make a kids portion meal without us ordering everything ala cart.  Was super excited to try the food here based off of the other good reviews, but unfortunately we will not be back."}
{"text":"I was visiting my parent and decided to get some kabob for my dad's birthday.  We got the lamb, chicken & both kind beef kabob. The food was fresh & delicious. I will definitely order food there the next time I'm in Gilbert."}
{"text":"I had chicken here it was really tender and delicious! My friends had chicken/ beef they were pretty happy with their choices too! And staff were really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I got the combo it was a great portion and had so much flavor! My son got The chicken shawarma wrap and he really enjoyed it! Best middle eastern restaurant in all of Arizona for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food! Love the lamb but my favorite is ghormeh Sabzi it taste just like my grandmas"}
{"text":"Omg this place is disgusting. The salad was hot and the cucumber wasn't even cut it was in chunks on plate. I feared I was getting e.coli"}
{"text":"Followed a friend's recommendation and have thanked them for it. I really enjoy the grilled chicken and recently tried the delicious pomegranate vinaigrette on the side salad. Prompt, friendly service with healthy portions"}
{"text":"I only have 3 words to describe the quality of Fillet and Lamb Kabob I regret ordering from this smoke filled establishment. 

DRY / TOUGH and TASTELESS!!!!! 

OK, I lied. Plus 2 Words 

NEVER, AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"I bought a groupon for $16 for $30 worth of food at this place. I got to the register and ordered $22 worth of food and was told I cannot use my groupon for anything under $30. She told me it had to be $31 or more. That kind of urked me because it didn't state that on my groupon. I don't get what's wrong with allowing me to use my groupon for less than $30. I didn't mind taking my $8 loss since I only paid $16 anyways. So I ended up having to buy another meal to go. I would have rather bought baklava but they were all out. So I came out of pocket $2 extra. The food was ok but I doubt I'll come back. Id rather go to Good Fellas on greenway & 19th ave. Their food taste better and they always have baklava."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the beef kabob from this place! The food is flavorful & filling.  I have not had a bad experience yet, with take-out or dine in!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week.  The portions are very generous and the food is outstanding.  I usually get the beef and chicken combo and it is always great. Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"ZK grill is such a hidden gem! I love the food and the portions are great for about $10-$13 a plate. They are a little take out place with minimal seating but their food comes out fast so there doesn't ever seem to be a huge line. I really like the shrimp platter. It comes with some seasoned tiger shrimp, a large portion of saffron rice and a salad. Their salad dressing is ok, but everything else is amazing! The shrimp is fresh and cooked well to where it is bouncy but not tough. The rice has some flavor and if you add the spice at the table, there is a tart and salty flavor. Besides my usual dish, I have heard their gyros are great too!
This place is a friendlier and cheaper version of a place in Tucson called Alibaba. The baklava here is just as sweet and delightful. It is still missing something since I'm still looking for the perfect baklava, but they tried. I highly recommend the food here and signing up for their discount texts."}
{"text":"Great healthy place!
This is a small, quiet place. I think most people order take out, but it's clean and the owners care about the place. 
We all ordered combo plates that were VERY generous portions with good prices.
The chicken kabobs are really flavorful.
My kiddo LOVED their French fries, except for the ones I stole (there were quite a few, because they were GOOD)."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best gyros in town and for a great price. The proportions are really big and I am always full once done. The place is clean and the staff is nice too."}
{"text":"Food was great.  No issues.  Wished there were more people coming here as it was a Friday night we came.  Food was perfect and I'm glad my husband and I came here this evening.  We used a Groupon for $30, which was no issue either.  

I think it was 35 minutes from the time we walked in, ordered, got our food, ate, and left.  Quick.  Works for us."}
{"text":"The food is soooo good here.  It's a bit far from where we live, but not too far from our church.  I had an Amazon voucher I had purchased awhile back and forgot, so we had to use it before October.  Today was a great day to use it.

It's in a little strip mall with other eateries near it.  Not a very big restaurant, but pretty clean.  The portions are pretty big and if you come, you can share with someone or you'll most likely have leftovers.

My husband ordered the Beef & Chicken combo - which came with salad, a rice that you put butter in it, a skewer each of tasty chicken and meat kabobs, as well as a roasted roma tomato.  I wanted my husband's salad, which I had a champagne dressing (like Italian) and my husband took my fries.  I ate his roma tomato, which was very delish.  This was about $13, I think.

My daughter ordered a gryo wrap with fries (you can get fries or a salad).  The gyro was loaded with A LOT of meat.  She was stuffed.  There was a large portion of tzatziki sauce.  I think this was either $7 or $8.

My son ordered a falafel wrap with fries.  The falafels were huge.  I think his wrap came with 3-4 falafels.  He loved this.  His came with tzatziki sauce, too.  I think this was $7.

I ordered the lamb wrap and this had the least meat of all the dishes, but still was plenty for me.  I exchanged my fries for a salad, as my husband didn't have the choice of getting fries or not.  He could either have all rice, all salad or half rice and half salad and there was a lot of rice and salad on his plate.  My lamb wrap also came with a healthy portion of tzatziki sauce.  Mine was $9.

The soda fountain drinks were a little bit overpriced at $2.49 for what is considered maybe at medium soda at McDonald's or Wendy's.  But, today we didn't care.

We took leftovers home (we probably should have had more, but we made pigs of ourselves.  We did not have to wait long for our food.  The meats were all tasty, not dry rather moist with great flavors as all were marinated in delicious spices.

I didn't know there was a ZK in Gilbert, so next time we can go to that one.

We also saw other Middle Eastern families there, so this must mean to us that it's food good enough for them and authentic enough.  Very glad I chose to get an Amazon voucher.

Also, service was excellent.  No complaints.  They were perfect in every manner.  The restaurant wasn't packed, maybe 1/4 filled.  We'll be back either here or one of the other restaurants and hope they are just as good.  

Thank you!!"}

Would I got back here again? Probably Not. For a place that does advertise \"healthy living\" as part of their title a lot of the stuff was pre-prepared, heated up or came from a bag. Looking at their inspection score it also makes me question a restaurant that does not participate in the grading scale. If you were proud of your business, you would let them grade it as be to show you are doing the best you can for your customers. 
The Restaurant: 
The store itself was only somewhat clean which did worry me at first. The biggest culprit had to be the drink machine. As you could see the side of the drink machine by the way it was placed, you could tell this had not been cleaned in a very long time. It had stains and streaks all down the right side on something you would expect from a run down convienient store. Quite a bit of silverware they had for customers had stains on them. 
What was nice: 
The Staff. The staff was very friendly which was one reason we did end up staying. 
What I did not like: 
My wife working at many different restaurants noticed the Gyro meat seemed the same as she has seen ordered refrigerated. There was a spit there but was not being utilized at all as you would expect a true Greek restaurant to have/utilize. The salad was completely unimpressive as it was just a bagged, iceberg lettuce salad with some premade Greek dressing. The rice was also dry and made a majority of the plate for the lack of Gyro meat they placed on it. 
Should you go: 
I would say no. With as many \"Greek\" restaurants there are around town, you could find better. The Staff themselves were great and I hate to do this kind of review but spending my hard earned money at this establishment in the future is something that will not be happening. 
My Kids Review: I should have ordered french fries instead"}
{"text":"We had the best lunch today. the chelo kabab from Zeytoon Bistro brightened our rainy cloud day. The quality, portion size, and the price of  the take out were awesome.
Thank you Thank you Thank you Zaytoon Kabab Bistro. We wish you lots of success. We hope you will open one close to us in Thompson Peak and Pima soon."}
{"text":"11/19/15

Had a Groupon that was to expire last night, so took Mom for dinner.  I've been enticing her to go since buying the coupon in July, but she could not remember ever dining here, so she kept saying no.  She certainly remembered after taking one bite of her lamb entree!  All she kept saying was \"Oh, wow\" and \"So good!,\" over and over, and soon I began to chime in canon.  But I am getting ahead of my updated review...

When we entered the restaurant, I almost did not recognize the place, since the atmosphere has certainly changed.  The kitchen window is still there, but it's now fronted by two tables, in the shape of an L, upon which the register is on one end, and styrofoam food containers and baklava and other pastries in to-go containers are on the other end.  Three walls have pretty mural photo wallpapers of lush green scenery and ruins on them, and there are lovely new plum/burgundy cushioned booths installed.  Perhaps the owners will open up the kitchen a bit more, to let us see more of the kitchen action.  Being able to only see the kitchen staff's faces gives me the willies, for some reason... Hehe!  :)

After Mom had a few bites of her lamb entree, with half-saffron rice and half-salad, she asked me to find more ZK Grill Groupons to use in the future. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zk-grill-phoenix-2?select=OKlzf5ZnGDgzy53noOlAzQ  I already knew that she loved the food here (so did I), so I am always looking out for ZK Grill deals.  Have I told you yet about the Chicken and Filet entree I ordered? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zk-grill-phoenix-2?select=XTjf8HfYHfWdU0OYLWBWhw  I also went with half-saffron rice (yes, I still am allergic to rice, but I can't say no to saffron rice, especially buttered saffron rice!) and half-salad-- you MUST try the champagne vinaigrette here, oh my goodness!  Great portions, and even better still, great flavors and textures (meat, salad, and rice).  I'll forgo the chicken next time (nice color and slight grill flavor, but the texture was ALMOST on the tad-dry side) and just go full-on filet, but now that I think about it, I don't think that's even an option here (??).  There's lamb, lamb with ground beef (a la koubideh style), chicken shawarma, chicken and filet, but I don't think there's lamb and filet nor just filet.  Hmm...

We ended our meal with Saffron ice cream, but instead of a scoop of ice cream and a cookie wafer placed on top, it's now made into an ice cream sandwich between two wafers and pre-packaged. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zk-grill-phoenix-2?select=849LmOk-UwUvmTvx3is6jg  Same great ice cream flavors (rosewater, saffron, and pistachio) and little bits of pistachio bits for texture, but the wafers aren't crispy anymore-- the refrigeration has caused them to lose their crispiness.  I hope the owners/staff revert back to serving this dessert item like they used to, a scoop of ice cream with one wafer on top, and perhaps a second one upon request!"}
{"text":"The lamb and chicken is on point. The chicken being so moist and flavorful, no dressing needed.  The lamb carved nicely with good flavor, not overly saturated in salt or oil. The salad being served  with nice green romaine lettuce, sliced tomato and crisp Cumber drizzle with light feta!  Why haven't I found this place sooner."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, quality, portions, friendliness the whole 9! Would recommend this Persian restaurant to anyone looking for an incredible meal at a great value! Support local small businesses!"}
{"text":"So the signage above the restaurant clearly states \"Healthy Cooking\". It's not. It's just typical gyro/Greek food. No one behind the counter understood \"no carbs\" because it is not a healthy cooking place. It's gyros. I ordered the lamb and it was fatty, flavorless and just not that good. The side salad was 90% lettuce and boring. There is a weird smell  here and the decor is non-existent. There is much better gyro places out there. The false advertising bothers me more than the mediocre food. Won't come back."}
{"text":"It's not bad but it's not authentic.. I usually get the gyro plate. Meat is good . Rice is totally plain . They add a container of butter so you can flavor it lol not very middle eastern at all  pita is not bad. Kinda pricey but what middle eastern food isn't lol (in the U.S.) I would recommend it ."}
{"text":"I gave it one star last year but thought it was time to try it again. Unfortunately I wish I could give it 1/2 a star. It has got more expensive..which is a mistake. It is a sparsely furnished, uninviting place with formica topped tables and a take out counter. This is NOT a restaurant. First...they had run out of Falafel! A Mediterranean restaurant without Falafel is like a burger joint without fries! Second the Gyro meat was dried out, burnt and inedible. And about 1/2 the amount they used to serve. No, no, no. Don't waste your money or your taste buds."}
{"text":"I love having this option for healthy, delicious food nearby. It's like what Pita Jungle wishes it could be. On my last visit, I had the chicken and beef skewer combo, plus a side of large hummus. The meat was all delectable and the long grain rice is mamazing.  The included salad was better than an included salad. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Our server, Zach, was great...very helpful and attentive.  He answered all of our questions, and we had quite a few as this was our first visit. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Delicious food. I order the Greek salad which was a good portion size and the ground beef combo. The beef was juice and had lots of flavor. Great place to eat and affordable prices for the amount of food served."}
{"text":"Food is always so tasty and fresh no matter what you order. The baklava changed my life. And the front counter girl is super sweet!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is spacious, with a pleasant atmosphere. I ordered a falafel wrap to go with fries. The wrap was a sizable portion with falafel, veggies, and sauce on the side. Unfortunately it was more of an open faced pita since it didn't close all the way which made it awkward to eat with round falafel patties in it. Quite a few times the falafel rolled out of my pita and onto my table, with or without sauce on it! The sauce itself was creamy but didn't have a lot of flavor. 

The fries were a huge amount which I appreciated. Service was friendly and it didn't take too long for my wrap to be made. If I'm in the area I'd probably stop by to try something else if I'm in the mood for Middle Eastern cuisine."}
{"text":"Food is always awesome. My coworkers and I go here often for lunch, food has never let us down. Sassy african american women is sassy though"}
{"text":"I just gotta say, serving fresh hot flatbreads from a tandoor makes all the difference in the world!!  Helps that the meats placed on top are just as good!"}
{"text":"I came here for the koobideh but am giving 5 stars for the saffron ice cream. So unique and yummy! Great affordable place for a quick meal to go. The food is very fresh and authentic Persian."}
{"text":"Yummy Gyros! Skip McDonalds and Subway and go Mediterranean!   Very friendly staff greets you when you come and answers any questions you may have.  The brochure, it's a nice print out however, it has the wrong prices for wraps.  A little pricey for what you receive, however, I like the gyros and some how if I have to choose Subway or Zaytoon, I like having a falafel gyro instead of a BLT."}
{"text":"So....if I had gotten the gyro like my husband, I would have given this 5 stars. However, I got the chicken kabob, and it was only so-so. I should have gotten the hummus and dolmas like I wanted, then maybe I could have given it more stars. Oh well."}
{"text":"I love this place! My first time here tonight, the girl that took my order (Satareh) was SO helpful and welcoming, and she recommended a super yummy dish (Barberry rice and chicken) AND it feels like clean, healthy food... I will definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Having seen all the positive reviews I decided to give this place a try for takeout. I saw a few reviews mentioning groupon so I searched groupon for a deal, sure enough I was able to snag a deal. Score!

We ordered a chicken plate and a chicken/filet combo. It was ready within minutes, service was good. Facilities were clean. Price was $8.99 for the chicken plate and $14.99 for the chicken/filet combo. Groupon was a godsend. I saved $9. 

On to the food... Maybe it was an off night and the B Team was cooking? Sorry guys... Chicken, salad and rice were good but my issue was with the \"filet\". More like an overcooked sirloin. Should've known when I placed my order over the phone, the gal never asked how I would like my filet to be cooked... So. The \"filet\" had a good flavor but was so tough and overcooked, it was not pleasurable at all. 

Their champagne salad dressing was wonderful though!I'll have to give this place another try next time. Fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"friendly service and great food. Looking forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! I thoroughly enjoyed the take out. The kalamata hummus and daily special (Tuesday) were the highlights. Anyone who slams this restaurant has no taste and doesn't deserve to patronize small businesses. Stick to the chains and leave the neighborhood gems alone!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time last night and really enjoyed it. We tried the chicken and filet combo with rice, the Gyro entree with half rice and half salad and one hummus appetizer. The beef filets were cooked perfectly, the meat was tender and very flavorful. I'm picky about my gyro meat, I hate biting into a lot of grizzle or ground bone, but I found very few pieces like that in their lamb. The flavor on this one was also very good. I was not impressed at all with their chicken. It had ok flavor, but you could tell it stayed on the grill WAY too long, the charring from the grill over powered any seasoning on the chicken and it was very dry on top of that. Their hummus is a little bland to me as well. I do think they need to train the person taking phone orders a little better. When we called we asked if all of the entrees we ordered came with tzatziki and they said yes they do. However only one meal came with it, which was the gyro plate, had we known it only came with one we would have ordered extra sauce. All in all we enjoyed our food and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Am kind of new to Mediterranian and happened to check this place randomly. Loved the food here. I usually have the chicken and shwarma wraps !"}
{"text":"I was in there today. Greeter was rude said there were no more \"to go menus\".  I asked the special she rudely said \" there\" and pointed without even looking at me ! I will not be back customer service was awful"}
{"text":"Great little Greek restaurant. Food was fresh and plentiful. Recommend the red pepper hummus and chicken shawarma Greek salad. Service was excellent too."}
{"text":"Wow what a find.  This was a last minute decision on a Friday night when we did not want to wait for hours to get into some other over-hyped restaurant.    Let me tell ya, this place does not look like much, but the food is amazing.  Fresh, clean, and done as well as I have had in places for three times the price.  
The kid behind the counter could not have been better.  Friendly, fun and suggesting the specials with a smile.
We will be back, and for the Saffron Ice Cream.  ;-)"}
{"text":"Very good chicken entree. They marinate the chicken and it is very flavorful and very moist. 

You can have rice or salad with your order. Champagne dressing is very delicious. They offer a free fried tomato but I nerves get it because it is not my favorite."}
{"text":"Went in on a weeknight for take out.  The place was about half full with happy looking people, and my food tasted good.  But while waiting for the food,  the dining area and parts behind the counter I could see didn't look very clean, so I won't be back.  Table was sticky, dirty utensils sitting on and behind the counter, and the cook looked more like he belonged at an under age nightclub than a kitchen.  They didn't earn my trust."}
{"text":"The worst I have ever tasted among Mediterranean food. Horrible taste. We ordered combo platter and falafel wrap. As they were about to close we were requested to take To-go. So we took the food home and tasted horrible food ever. Fries has no salt and tasted like crap. The worst part is we were given filet wrap instead of falafel wrap. We don't even eat meat and I clearly mentioned that to \"Elahe\". Yet our food got meat in combo as well as the wrap. We drove 30mins and they messed it up."}
{"text":"Everything we tried so far was really good. One combo is more than enough for two people. Lamb and beef combo with half salad and rice. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Nice place, nice people. Big portions of food. We had the Gyro entree and Chicken entree, both were excellent with plenty to go home with :) can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place and very friendly staff. The lamb kabob wrap was very filling and so tasty. The lamb was seasoned with saffron and served with a generous side of cucumber yogurt sauce.  I also indulged in the homemade rum cake. It was lemony, sweetened with a sugar glaze and moist. Go here!!"}
{"text":"This was strictly for the gyro. I'll have to try some of the other dishes. The problem I had with the gyro is that is had a sauce similar to a gravy on it. It kinda hide the flavor of the gyro meat. They also offer lettuce on a gyro which is popular for some reason in Phoenix but I think is a bad idea since it goes from zero to soggy in 4.5 seconds. Let me say this though, the tzatziki sauce was outstanding. Super fresh and tasty. I'll be back just not for the gyro."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for ZK Grill. I've been coming here for quiet sometime. 

When I first came here I always wanted to try this place cause I love mediterranean food. So I walk in and i don't know how to explain. There's lots of booths and tables in the middle but hardly no one sits at the tables. I do see a few people but this is really a take-out type of place. We ordered our food and had to wait 30 minutes for our food cause of so many people calling in orders. So you got to be patient. 

You order at the counter and there is usually one person taking your order, packing up the take-out, serving the food to the tables and cleaning up the tables. So the person taking the order is really busy. 

I usually order the lamb wrap. Love the lamb. It's grilled and always cooked perfectly. Nice and juicy with good flavor. The wrap has about four to five large pieces of lamb with lettuce, tomatoes, and red onions in a pita bread. When you put the yogurt sauce on the wrap, oh my goodness. So good. I'm in love with the lamb. It also comes with salad or fries. I get the salad. It's a normal iceberg lettuce with tomatoes and cucumbers and you get your choice of your dressing. Not a real fan of the dressing but it's ok. 

My wife really likes the chicken entree where she gets about 5-6 grilled chicken pieces with rice, salad, a grilled tomato and pita bread. One thing is the chicken seems a little dry but my wife uses my yogurt sauce from my wrap and it makes a ton of difference. So she really like that. The rice is really good and really enjoys the grilled tomato. 

I've also had their beef skews. It's basically ground beef with lots of spices. Pretty good but like the lamb the best. 

So overall I love the food here. Really good. When I call in it usually takes between 15-30 minutes for your order to be ready so it's best if you call in. I really don't think there is any ambience at all. Very bland atmosphere. That's why I've never eaten here. So I love the food for a semi-quick Mediterranean fix. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Found a Groupon for this place. The gyros were good... Just need to ask for them to be put on the grill otherwise they are served soft which I'm totally not down with. The rice was really good but the hummus was bland. Service was ok... More disruptive was the fact that the young people working here seem to care more about joking and planning the making of smoothies than their customers. Super loud and disruptive. Other than that, the portion sizes were good and we got a good deal. I'd come back."}
{"text":"I like this place quite a bit, and have been frequenting it often. I am bit worried as it is always pretty empty when I go in (maybe just my timing) but the quality of the food never ceases to impress me. A few things have changed recently, last time I went they didn't offer me my choice of dressing on the salad (used to be pomegranate or champagne) and they didn't include a piece of pita ( but last visit they had downgraded from what seemed like homemade bread to store pita so the omission didn't bother me) and they also didn't included the grilled tomato which I love. I was a little bummed. Not sure if this was purposeful or just an oversight. On the flip side the quality and taste of the meats, rice, and salads hasn't changed and is awesome."}
{"text":"I got a groupon and I was not disappointed, I had the combination of a chicken shawarma and beef and it was delicious, the portions are huge and I had left over for the next day. The place is not very inviting needs a facelift abut food is delicious, the staff is friendly, will be back.
I had a baklava as a dessert it was heaven"}
{"text":"Fabulous portions ! Enough for two for sure on one entree! Fast service... attentive girl at register . Not the most friendly... but who cares ... it's the food that matters !"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times already. If you love the Persian Room then I think you'll love this place. I normally get the chicken with half salad and half rice with a grilled tomato. They have a pomegranate vinegarette and a champagne vinegarette. I usually prefer the champagne. The tomato is just really outstanding and the chicken is moist, tender, and flavorful on a bed of fluffy rice. They also serve yogurt soda, which I've yet to try. The first time i tried it was at the Persian room which is very unique. They're really friendly here and very quick to make your meal. They only problem is get here fast, because they close at 8."}
{"text":"I USED to go here frequently.  However, after last night I will NEVER return!!!
I went in at 8:50 pm.  My boyfriend and I were starting to place our order when the lady told us if we placed an order it would have to be to go because they were closing.  The open sign was still illuminated, but it was obvious they didn't want to be bothered with our order.  My boyfriend and I looked at each other bad said let's go somewhere else. The gal said thank you... I've eaten here at least a dozen times.  Apparently they didn't want our business.  
Crappy customer service makes me NEVER want to return!!! No matter how much I like the place."}
{"text":"I've been there more than enough to find out that place is one of the cleanest places in the town.
Their foods are delicious and is coming in huge portions.
Chicken,lamb,filet and all the vegetarian options.
I recommend it for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome! Large portions, friendly people, and clean! I'm so full! Really great persian food at a great price!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here several times, we always receive friendly service. We usually get the gyro's with fries, and you definitely get more than enough food. Plus they have the best fries in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Fooood was Amazing.. I ordered a number 14 yesterday with a side of hummus and pita.. Sooo yummy You get alot of food and you dont have to stand on the corner to make up for the bill I am definitely going back.. Oh and one last thing its nice and cozy and authentic.. Yeah Keep up the great food guys"}
{"text":"It's only been open for 4 days, but we ventured out to try it tonight.  I had been waiting for the opening, as ethnic food is not so readily available on this side of town.  Verdict......it was worth waiting for.  Some Persian delights, better than the Persian Room and a fraction of the price.

Very fresh.  Very clean.  Simple place.  Order at the cash.  No service.  Very reasonable.  

Great kabobs.  Great sharazi salad.  Great eggplant starter.  The meats were very well seasoned and marinated and were very juicy.   The lamb was excellent.

Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"A really good neighborhood place for middle eastern foods. Not real fancy decor, but clean and tasteful.  I had the chicken swarma salad, and it was delicious, not to mention huge.  Very fair price for the portions you get.  A huge menu as well, so it should be be able to satisfy your cravings.  Plus, check the sites like Groupon, etc, you can occasionally find a deal that makes it even more worth dining here !"}
{"text":"Always great service, clean restaurant, and of course GREAT food. It has quickly become my new favorite lunch to eat when Im at work. Ive even ordered through DoorDash. 
I havent tried much besides their beef and rice plate. Im not a fan of salad or roasted tomatoes so I just leave it out. 
Not sure how they season their meat but it has me coming back at least once/week!"}
{"text":"What a treat!     We have sort of outgrown the more costly 90-minute restaurant 'experience' and we often find ourselves at places like Chipotle, where we can focus on good quality healthful food, get in and out quickly and eat out twice as often for the same amount of money, and not worry about how we are dressed.    So Zaytoon is perfect for us!
  
We visited with two other families for the first time, so we got to try more items than if we had gone on our own.  The appetizers were superb:    Hummus with Olives (no pits, thank you!), Eggplant and Yogurt were all amazing, very different and I could have made a meal of these!   I did try the homemade Tandoori bread, perfect!  Worth spending all my carbs on!

I had the filet kabob with salad instead of rice and my husband had the Gyro plate with rice.  My filet was excellent!  I tried the Gyro meat and it was nicely seasoned.  I wish I had tried the rice, it looked so fluffy and everyone was raving.  Someone tried the homemade Saffron Ice Cream,  it looked delicious!   I snagged a bite, loved the saffron flavor, pistachios  and creamy texture but not so much the rosewater flavor, an acquired taste, methinks!

This was a fun, new ethnic experience for me, worth the drive, but  I sure hope they open one on the west side....  soon!"}
{"text":"Our second visit was a complete flop.  They got the order wrong... only one plate instead of two.  Chicken was absolutely terrible and had no seasoning.  Should have had the saffron and seasoning from before.  The rice was bland and there were NO veggies at all.  Not going back again... very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, but not great; however the shirazi salad and gyros were good. I tried the DeeZee and thought it was bland. 

Air conditioning was non-existent and food delivery took forever.  I arrived at 6:25 and it was nearly 20 minutes before I had my food."}
{"text":"Went here for the great groupon offering that I found - well worth it!  First of all, this is not Afghan food - this is Mediterranean and Persian.  (hopefully you true foodies out there know the difference).

We went on a Tuesday evening and I had the Tuesday special - a delicious Persian stew that I would order again and again.  

This is not a fancy place to go, but the food is tasty.  It's like the McD's equivalent of the nearby Persian Room!  

Definitely go if you are in the area.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"Great Gyro Wrap and Tabulie.  The Humus was a bit pasty but had good flavor."}
{"text":"I go here every so often for lunch when I feel like I'm going to be eating something healthy (even though it's really not) the food is simple but it's good. They have your basic meats chicken steak ground beef shrimp that you can get as entrees with rice and veg and they also have those same meats you can get in pita wraps with tziki sauce which is very good. The only thing I wish is they had more sides for wraps like rice or veg. They only give you the option of fries or salad but overall good spot for some quick good food. Don't expect to get great customer service though, the staff isn't rude but they aren't outgoing and friendly either"}
{"text":"I went here since it was near my hotel. I am so happy I came! This is some of the best Persian food I've ever had! The gyro with beef and lamb was HUGE! The salad I had was ginormous! I had to get a take out container to finish it later.

The people are friendly, and very helpful in describing food (unless you are like me and know Persian food). They have a great selection of various Persian food and drinks.
Prices are great for the amount of food you get. 

I will be coming here every time I come to Phoenix. Shoot, maybe I'll take the 2 hour drive from Tucson when I'm hungry for lunch or dinner :)"}
{"text":"Looove this place!! Best Kabobs in the valley. Chicken, beef and steak skewers all good. My favorite is #11 with just rice. The team is very friendly and the girl that works there is amazingly nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I have been to Zaytoon twice and both times have been wonderful. The food is pretty typical persian food.  Kabobs, couscous, taboule and gyros. The hummus is very good and I always a side of Gyro meat with my Chicken Kabob. The ingredients are fresh and the service is good."}
{"text":"I was here once several months ago and wasn't impressed with the look of it, but was pretty happy with my meal. I believe I had gotten the gyro (sans pita). Went the other day and was pleasantly surprised with the remodel, a huge improvement. I got the gyro again and it came with some yummy white and yellow (saffron?) rice that I really enjoyed. The service was good, the food was delivered very timely, and my friend and I did enjoy our food. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I will never come back. There is much better food around. I ordered the Chicken schwarma wrap with fries. Store bought everything. Fries were skinny, a little soggy, and bland. Pita was filled a curry sauce that was overpowering. I have had good mediteranean food, and this is far from anything close of that quality. I gave two stars because I was still able to stomach the food, although there is a weird aftertaste."}
{"text":"We enjoyed 2 great dinners today at ZK Grill.  Setareh, our server, was friendly, helpful, and provided excellent service.  The chicken/filet combo dinners were cooked to perfection and came in generous portions.  We ended up taking half of our meals home in to-go boxes. This place is super !!"}
{"text":"This was our first time and we used a Groupon. The front counter person was patient and helpful. She took phone orders, walk in, delivered and cleaned tables. She was the best at customer service. The food was fresh and delicious. The portions are very nice for the price. I had the chicken with 1/2 salad & champagne vinegarette with 1/2 rice and the grilled tomato. Dear husband has the same with filet. We will be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in today 2/11/17 around 3:30 P to get a take out dinner. My client cannot walk easily so I went in to get a menu to bring back to the car for her. The girl looked annoyed when I entered as she had to get up from a table where she was on her cell phone. She didn't like the fact I wasn't ready to order and told me the menu was not updated. I explained my client in the car could not walk and she gave me the menu. My client decided not to order anything so I took the menu back in. Once again the girl was annoyed that I interrupted her.  I said \"look\" and before I could finish she got up and waved me off saying \"no no\". I finished saying \" Look it doesn't cost anything to smile\". She just walked away. \"I added \"What a b$&ch\"!!!
I plan on calling the manager."}
{"text":"I live close to this location, and was glad to see a restaurant that serves my favorite  food, open. I was surprised at the selection of vegetarian, chicken and beef dishes on the menu. I've eaten there 7 or 8 times, and enjoyed every meal that I've had. I had a chicken entree for lunch today and loved every bite. I even like the yoghurt soda, which reminds me of the buttermilk that I enjoyed growing up. 
I like the staff, those I have met are really great. I will continue to eat here a couple of times a week, and tell others about this great restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the bagali polo with lamb shank to go recently. It was also a very great experience. The lamb was falling-off-the-bone-tender. The rice was fluffy and delicious."}
{"text":"I have been sick of the food in this area for a couple years, so the sight of a Kabob Bistro opening up a quarter mile from my office gave me a semi. I grew up eating Persian/Middle Eastern food, and think I know what a good kabob tastes like. Zaytoon's kabobs were mediocre. What I ordered had: Lots of meat (a little on the bland side), some lettuce, tomato, and onion..all wrapped in store bought pita bread. I watched my fries get reheated, and my order took 10 minutes to make. The little decor I saw was bad. The guy who took my order was friendly, but could easily be the next Green River Killer. If I could give 2.5 stars, I would. I got back to the office fully flaccid-"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and tastes great. The service is quick and the owner/cook is friendly. Next time I want to try the kabobs since they looked delicious. Dessert was perfect and I'm glad I stopped by.  The prices are reasonable and it's in a convenient location. 
It's a quick and fun place to stop for a Friday night."}
{"text":"As always, these guys are awesome. The guys are very friendly, the lamb wrap is awesome, the French fries are better than the fair and the cucumber dressing, well, you gotta try it."}
{"text":"I am giving this place a 4 start for the following reasons:

The price for what you get is very reasonable.  The food is good (not exceptional, but this is a fast food place) and I have tried 3-4 different thing.  Secondly my wife, who always eats Kabob Kubideh, thought it was excellent.  Again for the price, you can't ask for much more.  They have always been, at least at this location, very friendly and willing to accommodate changes to their set plats.  This is usually very difficult to accomplish in a Persian restaurant.  In once occasion, when the soda fountain was flat, the cashier was very apologetic and made sure we got soda in the bottle.

The best food item I have had was the Joojeh, and I have to agree with my wife that the Kubideh is also very good and seems to be all meet (very little or no fillers)

We will visit again this week and I should be able to post some photos."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and both times, they were super friendly and the food is delicious!!! I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Got the special of the day some lamb shank. I'm glad I did! Supporting small businesses in the community always. #delicious #healthy #sabor #baghalipolo #Ahwatukee #Az"}
{"text":"I tried to eat lunch there - wait was ridiculous, salad lettuce dirty, tables dirty and the staff argued the entire time I ate.  Wont ever go back.  Too bad, I like to support local places."}
{"text":"Loving this little spot!  The cooks are friendly, the filet kabob and basmati rice are great, and the prices are reasonable.  I hesitate to give 5 stars to a place with ambiance like a fast food type restaraunt but this place is exactly what you expect of it.  Clean, quick, and remarkably tasty!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed this time around :( I walked in and there was one person in front of me they ordered .I placed my order chicken wrap. After waiting a long 25 min an 3 ordered a that walked in after me I asked what's going on  & had noticed the guy in back making food was not wearing gloves and touching the food ! So I asked girl at front counter if they normally don't wear gloves to protect food aka health code she said it was only her first few days here and she did not know she said I think so ? I said well he's not now and now he's making my good gross. so I just asked for a refund . The staff was nice and the owner came out & was able to issue refund an apologized. The food coming out for others looked really good but I guess I won't be finding out."}
{"text":"We've eaten here now a few times and each time I have asked the person taking orders what is good (different person each time) and I have ordered their recommendation.  3 for 3 so far!  Each item I have ordered has been delicious.  Today I tried the Barberry Rice with Chicken.  Super flavor, tender rice, loved the dried berries sprinkled on top.  Definitely a do-again!  This place is a small spot in a strip mall off Tatum and Greenway and isn't anything fancy but the prices are reasonable and the quality is high and the food is quite healthy."}
{"text":"A hidden gem for authentic Persian food - these folks know how to marinate their skewers! Prices are absolutely right, the quality and taste are amazing, and there are Middle Eastern sweets for those that enjoy some sugar after dinner. Come eat here! They're a wonderful local business."}
{"text":"Great gyro's.  I had the lamb and hubby had the steak.  Found this on Yelp as we are in town for the FMCA International rally at the Rawhide Center."}
{"text":"This place is a GEM!! I had the chicken kabob and my friend had a the gyro. Can I say my chicken was seasoned well and so tender. Plus the gyro was humongous! I tried the eggplant appetizer. Not my favorite a little to much oil. However, I took another bite of the Kabob and then my tummy did a smile. The guy behind the counter was really nice and gave great suggestions and was knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"Great menu, lots to choose from. Very reasonable prices & delicious food. The meats were very amazing and they give you a generous side of sauce. Will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  This was the best kabob I've had in my life.  I got the chicken and lamb.  So tender and juicy.  Perfectly cooked.  Wonderful atmosphere and the host couldn't have been more professional!  We loved it."}
{"text":"Love this local restaurant! This is a regular place we go to for a casual, quick, dine-in or dine-out restaurant with amazing food!"}
{"text":"Very tasty Mediterranean spot excellent meat, made fresh to order fantastic service fast and friendly. Well be coming back and using groupon."}
{"text":"Very delicious chicken pita. The chicken was marinated very well, as well as tender! The hummus was good and all of the prices were quite fair. The girl working there was friendly and made you feel very comfortable with just enjoying the food and not worrying about cleaning up after yourself. Will definitely be visiting the location closer to home!"}
{"text":"I ate here several times through Groupon, which I buy when Groupon has 20% off sales.  Groupon told me that the 16h Street location has closed, but i could still use my Groupon at the Greenwway location, which is too far and I will not go there.  The staff at the 16h Street location knows nothing about any \"closure\" and they insist that i can use my Groupon that says Greenway, at the 16th Street location, because it is the same owner.  So i eat here on the way to my square dance on Weds.  

The food is fresh and reasonable, especially with the Groupons.  I like the lamb shank, as pictured, but with extra juice in that round container, otherwise anylamb shank is too dry to me.  They listed the lamb shank as a special price on a certain day, but the employee said she will make it for me at that same price any day.  

Anything I have ordered here is tasty and I make another meal from leftovers (I am trying to eat less, only eat half of dinner when I eat out).  No compaints about service, as you order from a counter.  Place is really small and informal, most people get take-out."}
{"text":"have definitely had better middle eastern food. I got a greek salad and falafel appetizer, husband had the falafel sandwich. Greek salad is just like any greek salad you would find anywhere else, with olives, feta, onion, romaine and a salad dressing that probably came from Costco. Nothing unique about it. Falafels were bland - crispy on the outside but dry and brown on the inside. Falafels should be flavorful and the inside should be green from including parsley and green onions in the recipe. nothing special."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. Their filet mignon is delicious. Fortunate to have them close to home to satisfy my ethnic cravings."}
{"text":"Really great food. I'd say the gyro meat is the best I've tasted in Phoenix. Kalamata hummus rocks. Falafel is super good- not too strong. Gyros are by far the best thing.  Lamb kabobs are good, too - can be a little over-done if taking food to go.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service, clean. Will come back. Very big portions. I had the chicken and steak meal which was delicious, my husband had the lamb which was also delicious. We found it with Groupon. Decor leaves something to be desired, but again, it was clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Very tasty Mediterranean style food. Their gyro meat is excellent and their pitas with the gyros are wonderful. The yogurt sauce was nothing to write home about, but the gyro was excellent even without wonderful sauce. The Saffron ice cream is tasty as well."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's a close by and inexpensive venue for Persian food. Love their gyros, koobideh ( which is like a ground beef patties - delicious- only shaped as a kabob ), their eggplant dip, all have been great. 

This place is so much better than the Pita Jungle where their pitas are horrific ! Only problem is that in the summer the place heats up because they grill right in front of you. Poor cooks. They are very friendly and super hot too ! My boyfriend loves the Persian Ice Cream, I love the Persian men. It's all good !
I enjoy the entrees- the rice it comes with is delicious, the pita warm and they give you a grilled tomato that compliment it all. 

I have to try their daily specials. Persian cuisine is wonderful and for a little more than McDonald's of KFC, you get healthy, totally delicious meal. Give this place a chance. Modern decor, casual and right off of Camelback."}
{"text":"Food is good, not great. Service a bit off and cooks hang at front door smoking until customers come, then prepare food without washing hands."}
{"text":"It was wonderful experience. Great customer service, best quality and I love their beef kebab."}
{"text":"Was craving something healthy and decided to try this place out. Tried the chicken wrap and omg! It was amazing came with a salad with pomegranate dressing. Very friendly And really good food. I recommend the chicken it's delicious."}
{"text":"Really a great place to grab lunch, take out, or get a quick bite. I work right down the street and the value here is tremendous. If you want to eat healthy you don't have to loose overall flavor. These guys do it the right way and the food represents that. They are an authentic Persian family that know how to make a great meal. I'm a foodie. I have high expectations with food and this place exceeds them. Also, the beautiful lady I believe her name is Naas is very welcoming and makes you feel at home every time. Highly recommend a visit to this place."}
{"text":"Great price for the amount of delightful dishes they have. Enjoy coming here with a great hospitality!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best ZK Grill of the few left. We drive out of the way to come here. The one that was close to our area closed due to bad management. This location is clean, friendly service and tasty food. We have a few small  mideastern places near us that are over rated by people who have no experience with authentic middle eastern food. We are French Lebanese and have lived throughout the middle east and grew up eating authentic styles from different regions. This is the better of most all of the others here in AZ. I won't mention names of a few up north that have gone down hill and are over priced and tacky inside. We will be here a few times a month to eat."}
