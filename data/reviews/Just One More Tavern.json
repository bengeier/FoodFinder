{"text":"Giday, to all you Wonderful Staff and Patrons @ Just One More Tavern, my good Mate Bomba and Myself road in to Kirtland in 2008 to get fuel for our Scoots, We asked the bloke at the Service Station,  where we could get a beer, Just down the road on the right, he said!!! We pulled up, and went in, being the BEST  Tavern EVER.  The Hospitality of People/Patrons, Owners,and Sevice was just incredible, \"Just one of a kind\" Yes l know there are heaps of places that are like this, and l've been to Many throughout AMERICA, and the World, over many years of travel, but this Tavern just did it for Bomba and Myself, Just One More Tavern and the People are a CREDIT to \"KIRTLAND\", which l believe is a town set in just a Beautiful Location a place, l believe should not be missed if you're over that way.By Luck if we didn't need fuel,,,? We could have missed it!!! How Sad that would have been.  I wish you all good health, Go Well Deni Down Under MELBOURNE OZ"}
{"text":"Thursday night is wing night all you can eat wings $4 each they are the full size Wing they have 10 different sauces all pretty good very tasty however they are served on a small appetizer plate and it gets very sloppy"}

{"text":"Tried out this old school divey little bar on the Kirtland strip. The place was an obvious home for regulars, but we were welcomed by them. They were cheerful and fun. Some were a bit foul mouthed, so it's not a place to bring young children. The staff also allowed vaping in doors and multiple smokers were in the enclosed front entrance porch. I just mention that so you can be aware.   The food was a little slow to come out, but the service was friendly and engaging of patrons. The menu was typical pub fare. The burgers were large for the price but cheese was extra. The menu advertised fresh cut fries that are no longer offered here. That was a disappointment once the food arrived. The fries ended up being a crinkle cut frozen variety. The wings were uncut. There were multiple sauce options. They were messy and tasty.   Three Miller lite beers, one vodka drink and a Pepsi, two burgers with added cheese, one with upgraded sweet potato fries, Mac and cheese bites and five wings came to $48.50 before tip.   There were TVs around the room, but none within view of my seat. If you want to watch, you'll have to seek out a good seat I guess. The prices are reasonable. There's not much variety on tap but a couple domestics. If you're just looking to hang out , grab a bite and aren't choosy about your beer, this would be the place for you!"}
{"text":"The best wings -- they are the whole wing (3 parts) -- with the mixed sauce. A place for the town regulars, but it is very laid back and welcoming."}
