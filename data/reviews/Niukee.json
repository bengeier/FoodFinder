{"text":"Now, I'll be honest, this restaurant is absolutely not what one would expect aesthetically from a restaurant of this calibre; it's a second-story, hole in the wall located on a derelict side street. In fact, this is exactly the type of place that one might see on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. That is, NiuKee leaves much to be desired on the outside, but more than makes up for it with the calibre of its service and the authenticity of its food. 

I came here after reading some glowing Yelp reviews and was not at all disappointed! The food was authentic, savoury, and fresh. Not to mention the HUGE portion sizes!

Try the hot and spicy peanut chicken - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This appears to be the ONLY Szechuan Chinese restaurant in the area, and we need our mala fix no matter where we travel: so off we march for Sunday lunch, determined to get the heat on...  I've never been here; my husband went on a mission to find a good Szechuan in Montreal, before I headed North.  

The appearance and décor is very different from what we typically encounter in Chinese restaurants in US: first, you climb up a set of very steep and long steps to the second floor.  The dining area is quite small, with numerous tables squeezed in, primarily large 10-person family ones, so moving around is a challenge.  The tables are covered with plastic tablecloths, so the whole feel is a bit dingy. 

We sat down, and studied the menu: the spicier, the better! We settled on spicy green beans, mapo tofu {always!} and mini-wantons in spicy Szechuan sauce.  Beans arrived first - and they were simply amazing! I've never had them so good: they were lightly fried with plenty of chili and mala, sprinkled with garlic and salt - we could not stop eating them!  Then the wantons were delivered: they looked pale, slightly drizzled with what appeared to be duck sauce. We asked for them to be \"fixed\" with more zest and heat, and set them back.  In the meantime, mapo tofu arrived: for me, it was just \"incomplete\": they used ground mala instead of whole kernels, which minimized the infusion of flavor into tofu; there were no scallions, no chili peppers, no chili oil [we're ok with no ground beef, as we eat vegetarian].  The fixed wantons returned: so much more flavor, but luke-warm!  How unfortunate...

Well, it IS the only Szechuan in the area, so beggars can't be choosers.  But I chose to find other dining options the next time I'm in the mood for Chinese in Montreal."}
{"text":"This was a surprise stop on our Montreal vacation. We were looking for an affordable dinner in Chinatown.  This fit that bill.  The food was tasty and reasonable but I do feel that we were slightly hoodwinked.  I choose this restaurant because it took reservations, I wrongly assumed that reservations = popular!  WRONG.  7pm on a Thursday night before a national holiday AND WE WERE THE ONLY ONES THERE!  This place is on the corner of an alley with a small sign leading you to the 2nd floor; we NEVER would have gone in without the YELP reviews.  I only gave it 4 stars because it is totally missing any type of Chinatown vibe."}
{"text":"Wow!  

La soupe aigre piquante etait succulente.  L'agneau tendre a souhait et la salade de tripes incroyable.  On y retourne pour le menu n'importe quand."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!  I went there 3 times.  1st time, no one.  2nd time, a couple tables were taken.  Last time, it was almost packed.

Great variety of Szechuan and spicy food.  It's cheap and delicious.  The staff (lady) is super friendly and she speaks French, English and Mandarin.

One of the best Chinese place in Montreal in my opinion.

A must try."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at this place. Every dish was full of flavour and served really warm. The place truly lives upto its hype. A small, hidden unimpressive looking restaurant run by a chinese family but the food is so delicious! We ordered spicy chicken which tasted fantastic. You can adjust your spicy level according to your taste and I would recommend ordering without bones. We also had sesame beef which was amazing. The beef was crispy yet super glazed with sweet sesame sauce. The dishes don't come with a side of rice so we ordered fried rice which was mediocre. But the chicken and beef truly won our heart and there's no doubt that we are coming here again! Also left a large tip for the only waitress (the daughter of the owner) who was waiting on ALL the tables on her own, can't imagine how stressful it must be for her. Strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Other reviews are accurate, the restaurant doesn't look like much, but is wonderful and if you decide to eat here you'll be very pleased with the quality and friendliness of the staff.

Menu in French, English and some form of Chinese."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant si vous voulez connaitre la nourriture chinoise authentique. 

Malgré un décor modeste, ce petit restaurant cuisine ce qu'on peut appeler une excellente cuisine chinoise ( pas du tout  apprêté de façon américaine) ou tous commande un plat et le partage avec la tablée ! Ce qui permets à tous de goûter chaque plat commandé. Les crevettes et l'agneau étaient excellents ainsi que le riz. 

Malgré un décor moche ce petit restaurant situé de l'autre côté de René Lévesque donc juste en dehors du quartier chinois, est quelque chose de bien à découvrir si vous soucier plus de la qualité du repas que du décor. 

Ce restaurant est plus approprié pour un lunch qu'un souper, quoique pour un souper simple et rapide c'est parfait ! 

À découvrir !       


This is a good restaurant if you really want to taste genuine chinese food. Despite a more than simple setting this restaurant offer an excellent chinese cuisine ( not american style cooking). 

Anybody order a plate and share it with the table, so everybody can taste everything. Shrimp and lamb were excellent and i recommend it to anybody, rice was as good as you can expect from a chinese restaurant.

In spite of humble looks this restaurant just beside chinatown is really a good little restaurant if you look more for good meal than nice decor. 

More appropriate for a quick lunch than big dinner this tiny restaurant is a real discovery !

something to discover !"}
{"text":"Délicieux plats végé à un prix très raisonnable. Je vais y retourner avec mes amis c'est sûr!!!"}
{"text":"Owners are super super friendly and welcoming.  This is why I'm giving this 5-stars.  If you're looking for ultra-authentic Chinese food, well... you shouldn't be in Montreal :D Food itself is between 3-4 stars (my reference point: I grew up in Vancouver, Honger-central).

At dinner, the owner and a friend were dining at a table beside our group of 16 and they had brought most of their own food to eat in Tupperware and had it re-heated by the kitchen.  We were kinda curious at what stuff they had so they they kept giving us samples of their food to try and explaining what it was.  

The last stragglers who were chatting with them and sampling their home-cooking also got a round of St-Ambroise apricot beers on the house.  This has never happened in all my years of eating in Chinese restos.

So, super nice owners, in a quiet restaurant tucked away on Clark, just north outside of Chinatown."}
{"text":"It looks unimpressive from the outside but this is the beat Chinese food I have ever had in Montreal! I tried the mango chicken, general Tao chicken, don-don noodles, sweet and sour soup, and the spicy sour potatoes. All excellent. Friendly service too!"}
{"text":"You REALLY can't judge a book by its cover here! On the seedier side of Clark, with a grungy exterior, grungy narrow staircase, grungier looking washroom door on the first landing, you'll find yourself wondering if this is really a good idea? Don't be put off! Here is where you'll find some of the best Chinese food off the  beaten path of tourist infested Chinatown.Tom yum soup was delicious and spicy, the hot & sour was just as good.The fish in orange sauce was super,as was the fish in garlic sauce, though there was no perceptible garlic flavour, the lemon chicken was great, spiced eggplant came to the table whole, and was excellent. The sesame beef was good, but not as good as the fish and chicken dishes, which included the kang pau & chicken with cashews. The lamb with shallots was stringy and fatty, the spiced green beans I found to be better elsewhere. Overall though we (a group of 16) were very pleasantly rewarded and happy to discover this previously secret little gem."}
{"text":"I won't beat around the bush here, NiuKee is a hole in the wall. Down a darkened side street with an abandoned lot on one side and something forgettable on the other side, the customer entrance looks more like a service entrance.  Proceed up the decrepit looking stairs and on the second floor amongst the yellowing Chinese kitsch used as decor is the dining area.  Crowded with assorted tables and chairs that saw better days a decade ago take a seat and grab a menu. Be sure to glance at the aging dumbwaiter which just seems so out of place to me, but undeniably useful.

If you've made it this far(into my review and the restaurant), it's fair to conclude the NiuKee isn't about the decor.  You're here for the food and NiuKee serves up some of the most authentic Mainland Chinese food you'll be able to find in Montreal.  The first thing to note is that they do serve cold beer, which is always welcome. I'd recommend eating with friends on a Friday or Saturday night before heading to a more serious watering hole.

The food is exactly as you would find if you were in a similar establishment in China.  The spicy chicken is actually spicy and has bones, they serve classics like julienned potatoes with peppers, spicy green beans with pork, and the always popular cucumbers and garlic appetizer.  Having soup with dinner is the norm in China and here at NiuKee we usually choose the fish with pickled vegetables since the broth makes a delicious soup.

Not fine dining, but good food at decent prices and very authentically Chinese.  It's probably worth bringing a Chinese friend with you if you aren't familiar with real Chinese food. Though, if you are feeling adventurous, go without and play food roulette, because remember they have beer and everything is better with beer."}
{"text":"We give three stars and want to put some context to giving this rating. My husband and I decided to go to Chinatown after 8pm on a Friday, rainy day. Most of the places we wanted to try were closed or full. So we decided to check this hole in the wall out because we were close by. 

The atmosphere is nothing spectacular. At 9pm, there was us and 2 other guys. The woman waiting us was nice. The menu has pictures of the food, and immediately we realized the food was more American/Canadian Chinese food (fried, lots of sauce, etc). We had the shallot pancakes, which were fried and okay, to start. 

We ordered the garlic eggplant, which was okay with light spicy peppers and lots of sauce. Next, we got the fried slice beef. It was greasy but good for westernized Chinese food. The rice was a saving grace for balancing the dish. 

FYI- when ordering rice for two...get the two small bowls. Do not get a medium rice bowl because it feeds six people. 

I gave three stars because though the food was okay; it is not authentic Chinese. Everyone saying it is, doesn't know authentic Chinese. If you have a craving for greasy and saucy westernized Chinese food, this is the place for you. We'll likely pass on this place the next time we come to Montréal."}
{"text":"Don't be turned away because it looks like a hole in the wall. Walk up the stairs - the kitchen is on the first floor to your right - and you are greeted by the friendly owner in a small restaurant. My wife and I ordered the tofu dishes with extra spice and we got what we asked. Almost too hot but after 15 minutes I realized half the heat was from the temperature. Everything cooked to order and served immediately. 
Our friend ordered lemon chicken and he said it was the best he ever had and was still talking about it the next day. 
Great food full of flavour."}
{"text":"The experience was horrible. The worst I've ever had. The waitress was new and didn't know their own menu. I went here with my family and we left just a few minutes ago. We ordered beef with broccoli and Chinese broccoli among others. We got those 2 first. The beef tasted funny and weird. The Chinese broccoli still maggots in them. When my sister saw it we cancelled everything and left right away. 

If I can give a zero. I would."}
{"text":"Excellent, unpretentious Pan-Asian (mainly Mandarin) restaurant near the heart of Montreal. We arrived by train from NY on Monday evening (Aug. 15, 2011) and ate there with my close friend in Montreal and his two teenage kids (his wife had to attend her friend's birthday party and couldn't join us). Tons of excellent food, friendly and good-humored trilingual (Mandarin, French, English) service, and very reasonable prices. A little hard to find if you're not a local, but well worth it."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to a delicious meal, and were prepared to overlook the lack of ambiance. Truth is, the food lacked as much as the ambiance. We had hot and sour soup, it was much more sour than hot. On recommemdations of a previous comment we ordered the lemon chicken ...seemed like every bite I took was just batter...didn't even taste chicken. The eggplant with garlic was tasty but a bit too oily, and the lo mein was tasty but certainly wasn't a memorable experience. Overall we were dissapointed with our meal...and I wouldn't make it a point to return."}
