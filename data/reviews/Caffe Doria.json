{"text":"Nice but expensive and busy. Upper class treat for your taste. Hopefully the worst waiter ever left the place and now people are nicer even when they are busy."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and service. High prices and small portions!  9 Bucks for a small sandwich is pretty much. But the sandwich was great. Coffee was good as well..."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what to say about this place. Part of me wants to rant about the miserable service and warn people to avoid coming here at all costs. But the fact of the matter is that I come here for brunch almost every weekend. So it can't be that bad.  The good: The ambiance is really nice. Every table has fresh cut flowers and the patio certainly beats the tables Starbucks put in the parking lot across the street. The coffee is also top notch.  The bad: The menu largely consists of pre-made sandwiches and salads. The brunch menu only has about four options and for some reason the kitchen refuses to make any of them after 12PM.  The ugly: I honestly think that the waitress with the curly black hair goes out of her way to piss me off. She acts as though her customers don't even exist. She makes you wait forever to get your food and even longer to pay. Other times I feel like she tries to create an uncomfortable atmosphere just to make people leave. One time that I was there she made so much noise clanging dishes and cleaning up that I honestly couldn't hear the person sitting next to me. Other times she just completely ignores me. I don't know why she does this. Maybe she just thinks that since I'm a regular I'll keep coming regardless of the service... But after giving her many chances I've made the decision to have my coffee elsewhere - even if it's not as good."}
{"text":"The food was alright, but the service was slow and the staff were cold."}
{"text":"Went for coffee on a lovely Monday morning to the Cafe. I have to say that the coffee was delicious. I ordered the Morning Glory panini. Big mistake... I got a sandwich consisting of two multigrain slices of bread, toasted, no butter or any sort of spread, 4 slices of under ripe avocado and 3 slices of tomato. A small bowl of run of the mill fruit. All this for 9$. REALLY? I feel like they were making fun of the customer. I would recommend this place for a coffee but DEFINITELY not the food (well the 9 dollar breakfast 'panini', anyways)."}
{"text":"This cafe is a winner for me in the summers because I love the patio.   It makes for a great lazy weekday afternoon or morning, if you can spare it.    I've ordered ham and cheese panini, which was ok, although a bit bland.  Their arugula salad was nice and fresh.  The cappuccino was actually quite good, better than most places can make them."}
{"text":"Totally the worst first impression of a restaurant in Toronto I've ever had. I was waiting at the door for almost ten minutes and nobody greeted or asked if I needed anything. I wasn't the only one either. Another guy was standing behind me and kind of gave me a look like \"what the heck is going on, what are we supposed to be doing? Do we sit down? Are we supposed to wait here?\"  I've been to numerous busy restaurants in Toronto and New York, and none of them have made wait at the door for ten minutes without at least acknowledging the wait or taking my name down.  I ended up leaving, walking north along Yonge with my friend and found Avant Gout. Unlike this establishment, someone had greeted us at the door and made sure to sit us down promptly with a fantastic brunch menu. Thank you Caffe Doria. Without you, I wouldn't have found such a gem. For that, I gave you one extra star."}
{"text":"Nice spot for a light lunch indoors or having a summer drink on their patio. Had a grilled turkey panino with some extra avocado (they make them at the start of the day, so not fresh to order - but still can make slight changes) which came with a side salad. Mixed greens, not much else - but the right mix of oil and vinegar. The sandwich was light, flavorful, and as satisfying as turkey with cranberry mayo can get (pretty satisfying).  The pizzas looked uninspiring and were around the 15$ range. Saw an impressive sized calzone being served - the fat fuck inside of me regretted not getting one of those.   I think for the lunch crowd- this is a good alternative if the Terroni up the street is busy."}
{"text":"A very nice and charming local caffe with good espresso, and latte bowl and internet. A very nice patio where you can enjoy your coffee and read a book. I was hoping for a bigger selection of sweets, but overall it was a very nice spot."}
{"text":"It's a nice little place to hang. But food and coffee are nothing too special. I like the atmosphere and lovely patio."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast there this morning. This is my first review on Yelp and unfortunately it's a bad one. I'll keep this brief:  Cons 1. Dead fly in my chickpea salad (clearly they dont wash their greens - watch out if you dont care for e-coli) 2. Uninspired / bland food 3. No apology or acknolwedgement or discount for the dead fly  Pro 1. Beautiful patio and location to admire well-heeled 50 something Rosedale baby boomers plus a few trust fund babies (if that's your scene) - which maybe explains the uninspried blandness of the food 2. Server was working as fast as he could and was friendly and nice (for this reason we still left a tip - but he neglected to escalate the matter of the fly to his manager - or maybe he did, but she chose to disregard)  So likely never going back. But such a shame to waste such a prime and beautiful location on sub-standard service and food."}
{"text":"Just came back from lunch to celebrate my coworkers birthday - her pick for bday lunch spot.  We hit the lunch rush, but luckily we only had to wait 5 minutes for a table for 3. It's on the corner of Roxborough and Yonge St., about a 15 minute walk from work, tight space but they sure packed it with enough tables. They have a nice patio area for more seating in the summer. The kitchen is right in the space and desserts were displayed in the glass shelves - they looked real good!  Food (standard, nothing mind blowing - choices of salads, pizzas and paninis) Lasagna $10 - surprisingly good, pasta was cooked well, not over sauced. It was somewhat hidden in the menu (at the very bottom of the salad category), glad I saw 2 guys order it. Caesar salad $8 - mediocre, chopped up lettuce, under dressed, barely any parmesan with 3 pcs of small toasted flat pita bread. Very basic for the price. Coworkers had their paninis ($10), a fair size with a small side of salad.  They both enjoyed their food and their salads although small looked way better than mine.  Service I'm on the fence when it comes to their service... they were nice, but had an air of snobbery.  There were only 2 ladies looking after seating, taking orders, bussing and serving. They should consider adding another person for the lunch rush, but then again, the space is tight as it is. Service was also be a bit slow for North American standards, but since I came back from Europe, I learned to be patient with so-called slow service.  It's a nice place to eat and people watch if you're in the area and have spare time. Wouldn't mind going back during the summer and enjoy their patio. It is slightly overpriced, but you have to consider the location and regular clientele."}
{"text":"I used to Love Cafe Doria but now under the new ownership and renamed Doria it just doesn't have it right. The salads are very small for a meal sized and when I asked to add Chicken they gave fewer greens. The menu is extremely limited and the dessert selection too is much smaller. I am sad to see this ownership change. I was hoping for better."}
{"text":"I like this place for its patio, and it beats the Starbucks patio. The food is good and I am always pleased with the selection.  However, the service is always a turn off."}
{"text":"Cozy and cute resto with very affordable prices! I had the most delish pizza ever. Of course, i can not remember the name....but, I can NOT forget the taste. Thin crust pizza layered with caramelized onions, gorgonzola cheese, prosciutto, and honey. It sounds really sweet, so I was kind of afraid to try it. But, it was well worth the risk. All of the flavors complimented each other wonderfully. Seriously - a must for anyone who loves creatively made pizzas!  Yummmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Cute little local \"cafe\" with some seriously good food. The thin crust Margherita pizzas are divine. As are the soups like the lentil puree. The lasagna is so good my wife had me pick it up every night for a week straight.   We don't live around it anymore but go back often. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is perfect. I don't know how it got only 3stars. It's a 5star all the way. Either i go there for a coffee (i mean a bowl of latte:) or for a little sandwich, pizza or even breakfast, i am always always satisfied. The place is cozy and staff are nice. You feel that the owners love this place and you will love it too.  The only low point is the short working hours. They close really early:("}
{"text":"Cappuccino was nice.  No wow factor here.  We had fun hanging out in the caffee and said that this would definitely be a place to come back to with our laptops when we are doing our trip planning to the Balkans.  http://stellarperspectives.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/spectacularly-simple-birthday/"}
{"text":"The friend and I went to Caffe Doria for lunch.  I absolutely loved the sandwich I ordered.   Turkey + Brie + Cranberry Mayonnaise + Apple Slices = Love   The salad that accompanied the sandwich was excellent as well.   Next, I'll have to try their pizza!"}
{"text":"Well, this place tasted as good as it looked when I walked by it. Cute little outdoor seating around the corner and on the side street instead of Yonge, great menu with sandwiches, thin crust pizza, and salads. My friend and I shared the mixed green, apple, walnut salad with Goat Cheese instead of gorgonzola and a pizza. More than enough to split. I took a peak at the table next to us and saw a very healthy looking bean salad....mmmmm...beany.   All that for table service and you can also grab it to go. They also have the typical stand with coffee and pastries. Really great ambiance...however...looking at the wall trinkets, my friend realized it wasn't so much french/european cafe as swedish/american chochkees from IKEA and Target. Either way, it worked and music was great and on a nice day and a cool breeze it's a perfect leisurely lunch."}
{"text":"Doria is my \"go to\" place in Rosedale for pizza or coffee and a dessert. There are fancier places nearby but Doria is very comfortable, always cheerful and has a nice selection of thin crust pizzas and sandwiches , salads etc. Coffee is the best in Rosedale. Nice patio on the Roxborough West side. Small but well thought out wine list. I live across the street and I come here often alone or with friends. Always satisfies."}
{"text":"I stopped by Caffe Doria to try their latte and I was underwhelmed by the quality of it. There  was nothing special about it, it was flat and bitter even after 3 sugars. My Nespresso makes better coffee at home. The pasty I had was quite good though. Perhaps, other items on the menu are worth returning for, but I for sure would not go there if I'm craving a cup of latte."}
{"text":"This is a charming little spot with a fantastic patio. It has the feel of a cool Brooklyn cafe. They offer an assortment of pizzas, sandwiches, soups and salads on top of a small breakfast menu. Their espressos are decent and possess a great aroma and flavour. The food and service is lacking. There was a lady who kept coming around asking whether I had been helped but did nothing to fix things. Their prices are too high and portions are tiny. I will say that their red velvet cake is pretty awesome. Frankly, I think this is a much better cafe than restaurant."}
