{"text":"Tried this place today for the first time. Really awesome! I haven't been to another place in Arizona with fish as fresh tasting as this. They have a ton of topping options and sauces which is great. I tried the salmon and Hawaiian tuna and both were incredible. The staff were friendly and helpful with suggestions. This is a great healthy option is scottsdale and will definitely be coming back, probably this week."}
{"text":"As a lover of Poke (and part-time Hawaii resident), I have been unimpressed with the majority of Poke places going up in the valley....until I met Koi Poke Bar. 

The Good:
1. Prices are quite reasonable especially considering the quality of the ingredients.  The medium bowl was a ton of food and around $12 for more than enough food for lunch. 
2. They let you sample ingredients (sauces, fish, etc.) to make sure you get what you want.
3. They have genuine Japanese touches in the fish and side ingredients that other places don't (Poke Style Tuna, Seaweed Mixes, Masago, Octopus, REAL crab meat, etc.) 
4. They have some interesting beverage choices (I loved the options of fresh brewed teas) plus a BAR (not that I went to the bar during lunch, but heck, I might sometime want a beer or some wine with my Poke and nice to know I can get it). 
5. The Staff!  There was not one person who was not helpful, friendly, outgoing, etc.  They were there to make sure you had a good experience and I was super impressed.    

The Bad: (ok, actually nothing but a couple things to know):
1. The location I would have never found had a co-worker not told me about it.  Tucked away in a D.C. Ranch shopping mall behind a McDonalds not visible from the street but if you see the McDonalds, you are in the right place.
2. It's in DC Ranch in N. Scottsdale (darn, I live too far South to get here often).  BUT super convenient if you live or work in the area and a quick hop off the 101 as well.  

Check it out, I am glad I did."}
{"text":"Great experience trying poke for the first time at KOI Poke!  The place is very hip with friendly staff and the fish is fresh. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Awesome !! Great food , Great service and I love the fresh energizing look. The Hawaiian Tuna with rice and Spicy Shoyu Sauce is my favorite so far, but I still have many more choices to try. For desert you simply must have the Boba Berries and Cream Hawaiian Ice. The flavor of the berries will cause your taste buds to go crazy with excitement, it is like nothing I have ever tasted before and now, well now I'm hooked. Thanks for bringing this simple enjoyment to our community."}
{"text":"A great concept and take on Poke. Good ambience and a convenient location. I had the Hawaiian tuna with the Wasabi Aioli with a mix of toppings which made an excellent bowl. 

Just felt a little shortchanged on the helping. The 3 scoop of Hawaiian tuna I ordered was compromised to a 2 scoop as the bowl was nearly empty and because they wanted to keep the line moving and didn't get a refill.

Would definitely visit again and try endless permutations and combinations. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Koi Poke is my first time experiencing this new hip trend dining deliciously. The food is fresh and he highest quality. The customer service is sweet and fun and generous. Cool vibe. Perfection!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a pleasant surprise. Fresh Fish & delicious Poke in the main bonus. Add the exceptional service & chef prepared sauces & you would think you were in Hawaii! Relaxed & chill atmosphere. Food is made to order exactly how you want it. Delicious. Will absolutely make this place one of my go to lunches/dinner options."}
{"text":"Super fresh ingredients and very nice staff. Good portions. Definitively a new favorite of ours in the area."}
{"text":"Really great Poke place, especially for Arizona. My friend had been raving about Koi for months so I finally got around to trying it, and now I understand her obsession. 

First off, the staff was great. So friendly & helpful! My bowl consisted of: half spring mix, half brown rice, spicy and regular tuna, a bunch of toppings (get the seaweed salad!), and the house dressing mixed with the chipotle aioli (a recommendation from the staff). 

I was very pleased with the portion and taste. Will be back soon- most likely tomorrow!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place! Super friendly staff and high quality food. Build your bowl the way you like it. Lots of choices and unlimited toppings. It's both healthy and a great price point. How could you go wrong. One of my new favorite places."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get some amazing food. Really high quality, super friendly staff and keeps me coming back for more. The prices can get a little high, but the quality and taste makes the prices feel like a bargain for the food you are getting. It is a nice change of pace to Poke style places with the way they have it set up inside. Will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"If you've never had poke bowl, it's essentially a mix between a Chipotle bowl and sushi.  I was a little skeptical at first, but just tried this place out today, and BAM, what a hit.  These bowls are out of this world awesome.  The staff was friendly, the place is uber clean, and my bowl was amazing.  I love the fact that you can get seafood-rice bowl at about the same price as Chipotle. I'm trying to steer away from barn animal proteins, and so happy this place opened up so close to my house.

The seafood was very fresh (I tried the shrimp, lobster, and the crab).  The top fixings were amazing, and I'm definitely going back to try different combinations.  My kids (who are a little picky), thought their bowls were great and my daughter said, \"this is our new go-to place.\"  

This place gets a very high recommendation from me.  I will be back, again and again."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place on accident via yelp. I was searching for ramen and this popped up. Determined to try it out. Appearance is trendy and super clean. Staff was really friendly. Owner was awesome as well. Now to the best part, the \"fish\".  Fresh as fresh can get. I got the ahi, yellowtail and salmon with the spicy shoyu sauce. NAILED IT...! Fish is fresh and all ingredients were light and refreshing.  Better than some of the fish markets back home in Hawaii...! Yup, I said it. Who knew that a poke bowl place in the middle of the dessert could top fresh fish markets in Hawaii.  Will I be back, no questions asked, HELL YAH...!  Hope I dont crave it when I get back home."}
{"text":"Fresh, nice selection of add ins, alot of food for the price. Indoor and outdoor seating. Sit up bar or tables. One of the best Poke bowls around."}
{"text":"This place is the best!! This is the first time I remember ever writing a yelp review, but I just had to say two things. 1.) This is the best and freshest tasting poke place I've been too 2.) The owners are awesome. Not only is the food here great but I am always greeted with a smile. If my daughter is with me they always offer her a little cup of boba berries on the house. The owners are always checking in to make sure their customers are happy. Most impressive to me, however, was the fact that I provided feedback to the owner and he took it seriously enough to invest the time and resources to make it happen. I had asked for a nutritional calculator on the website and he actually had his website developers create one. When I was there today, he brought it to my attention and remembered that I was the one who had suggested it. I am so impressed with his professionalism and friendly demander. Way to go Koi Poke!!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious. It was my first time having a poke bowl and the staff was very informative as to what I was getting into and what recipes they suggest. Clean restaurant as well. The value was great and I'll be stopping by again"}
{"text":"Just had my 2nd experience at Koi and was just as amazing as before!  The salmon just melted in my mouth!  So glad Koi is in my neighborhood as I do love poke and this is one of the best I've been too!"}
{"text":"I couldn't be more impressed. Super clean, NO fishy smells, fair prices, great quality, good quantity, and super friendly service. I brought a client here based on all of the positive Yelp reviews and I wasn't steered wrong. I'll be back for sure! Delicious! -- I had a small with 3/4 spring mix and 1/4 brown rice, 1/2 spicy shoku 1/2 House sauces, Hawaiian tuna, salmon, avocado, crab salad, seaweed salad, fresh cucumbers, and sesame seeds. AMAZING. I wanted to, but couldn't finish it. Great portion. Seriously delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great food, the service is fantastic, and the pricing is very reasonable. It's going to be my go to place moving forward."}
{"text":"This was my first poke experience and I'm in love! The employee making my bowl was extremely polite and explained how it worked, he detailed each sauce and knew allergen information about each one. I got a small (2 scoops) with salmon, Hawaiian tuna, brown rice, and the sweet chili lime sauce. Both of the fishes were absolutely delicious, the salmon however was exceptional, I got it tossed in sesame oil, which mated well with the sauce. The sweet chili sauce was very good, I didn't think it had any heat to it but heat is subjective. I would definitely go back and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Best Poke Bowls in the valley. The food is great and surprisingly affordable. Cool atmosphere. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh sushi or veg bowls. Cane with 6 friends for the first time and everyone was excited and had only amazing things to say about the quality of the ingredients and the location itself. If you like the best fresh shipping grade fish without the high price.... This is your place. This coming from a vegetarian. Lol (peer review) 

Great deserts (Hawaiian snow ice)"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Poke and wanted to try out this nearby spot.  I immediately was impressed with the atmosphere - very clean and professional.  There's also a bar on the other side but it was unclear wherever it was functional or not since it was dark and nobody was there.  This poke spot is unique in the sense that it also has yellowtail and lobster as options and while I didn't get them this time, would try them in the future.  The staff was really attentive to sauces - do you want this in the rice, on the fish, or on top?  They also provide a full half of an avocado for the $2 which is a lot of avocado!  The downsides would be the cilantro and jalapeños could use a dice - the bigger pieces made it hard to mix in the bowl and eat.  Overall, it was a good experience and I will return.  I hope to use the bar, try new fish and sauces, and will hope for no cilantro stems!"}
{"text":"Wow the most delicious Poke restaurant I have ever been to in AZ and CA!   Way to go I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"This is the best poke in Scottsdale, hands down. We live in LA but travel to Scottsdale often. We eat poke in LA twice a week and to date Scottsdale has not had a decent option in our opinion. We tried this place right when it opened and.. wow!! What a surprise. I can honestly say it's better than our favorite poke spots here in LA. I'm looking forward to our next trip to AZ so we can come back. 

What's different: Concept. Split plan with a fast casual side to grab a poke bowl and go or eat in. Other side has a full bar. I've never seen this before but we loved it. How cool to have an elevated poke experience with a real plate, silverware and some cocktails. Brilliant.

What's yummy: OMG the lobster. It's a bit pricy but WORTH IT. The champagne sauce is straight up crack. The spicy tuna is to die for and the rice is perfectly sticky. My husband had yellowtail and salmon and went crazy. Their sauce menu is better than any poke place I've been. The crab was great. Everything was great. Haven't tried the octopus yet. Dying to go back for that. 

What's cool: the atmosphere. Vibey and sexy on one side, friendly, accessible and convenient on the other. Run in for lunch and grab a bowl to go or hang out and have drinks on a Friday night. Love this. 

What's bad: there is no koi poke in LA. That's it. I have nothing negative to say. This place is bomb. 

**Also, Koi management: please hurry up and get the Hawaiian shaved ice going! That's going to be awesome!"}
{"text":"Listen... this place is incredible! If anyone is reading this, you need to go try this poke! Everything about it screams excellence. They've recently changed the interior and layout and it makes ordering very \"user friendly.\" Most of the time in these kinds of places I don't have a good range of knowledge when it comes to knowing about what goes well with what. I didn't have to worry about that here. The fish here is very fresh. The sauces are outstanding. And I had no problem ordering because of how everything was placed. The staff answered all questions and were knowledgeable on the product. There are unique teas at the end of the line if you aren't wanting a standard fountain drink, along with some local rad juices in a fridge. I love how they support local businesses. My husband and I got a rewards card at the end of the line saying we can get a poke bowl for free after getting 10. The music was quality over the speakers, and at a good volume. Looking around, all of the other customers seemed relaxed and happy. I enjoyed my time and I am absolutely coming back!

To be honest, I kept looking out the window and felt bad for everyone going to McDonald's! I was eating quality healthy food for a similar cost and I didn't feel like crap after eating it haha  I mean, I'm a mother of a four year old and if anyone understands going to McDonald's because it's fast and cheap, it's me. But can I just say, I saw a total of 5 toddlers in 3 different families while I was eating here. And all of them liked the food just fine. I'm taking my kid here next time. 

Five stars all the way! This restaurant is going places I hope you guys open up more shops! 

Thanks for a great lunch and many more to come!"}
{"text":"I feel bad giving this place a three star rating since other reviews seem to rave about it, but I just did not have the best experience here. I would give it two stars, but I feel like that's not entirely fair.

I want to say it's due to user error, but I got a medium bowl with tuna and salmon, white sushi rice, crab meat, cilantro, and spicy mayo. It's been a while since I was there, so I'm not sure if I had anything else in the mix, but I know what stood out to me. There was an overwhelming amount of spicy mayo AND cilantro, it felt like that was all I was eating. I also had a lemonade for a beverage, and it literally tasted like water with a lemon slice in it, and that's it. I spent around $15, and it felt like a complete waste of money.

I love sushi, and it was my first time here after my best friend had such a great review. My boyfriend loved it, too, so again, I think it has more to do with me personally rather than the actual establishment. The ambiance was great and the staff was friendly, but I just could not get into the food at all. I will return, however, because I do feel like I owe myself AND Koi Poke a second chance."}
{"text":"A Top 10 in the World Amazing!!  The food is clean, fresh, delicious, and perfectly created. The staff is knowledgeable and gracious in every interaction - from ordering, to paying, to stopping by and checking in. A favorite in my top 10 in the world places to eat! The variety of sauces and additions are plentiful and quality.  Thank you and please go National."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing lunch here.  Place is quite new and clean.  Had a bowl with Hawaiian tuna, salmon, and spicy tuna.  The fish was incredibly fresh and flavorful!  Rivals some of the sashimi I've had at good sushi restaurants.  Walked away feeling very fulfilled and will probably make this a weekly tradition after the gym.

Overall, great value, excellent flavors, good service and ambiance.  Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite poke place. The ingredients are always fresh and you can taste the quality. The service is always great as well. Definitely becoming a regular spot for me!"}
{"text":"I'm a local living in DC Ranch. I'm a poke fanatic and have ate at almost all poke spots in Arizona. This will be my new home base. The owners are very attentive and if you have never tried poke you are in for a treat. The quality of the fish is superb and the crab mix is made out of real crab. Very impressed by quality and presentation. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Kind of an expensive poke place. They also charge extra for some extra toppings :(

However, did enjoy my poke bowl very much. Did half and half with two scoops of protein. Overall enjoyed and the rice was very quality."}
{"text":"Best Poke I have had!  Chris made our bowls, explained our options, let my son try the different sauces and sides. Great decor and location! Will definitely be a regular spot for us:)"}
{"text":"Fish has always been fresh.  Portions are good and they have most toppings.  Hoping they add dried seaweed.  Nice frequent buyers club also is a nice bonus if you go often."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious. Absolutely love this place. Fish is fresh and they have a huge selection of wonderful trimmings to make it amazing."}
{"text":"I love a great poke bowl and I was excited to see that this was \"coming soon\" into the neighborhood.....Well Koi finally opened today and OMG....this new place has BY FAR the freshest seafood of any of the local poke bars.  I chose the medium bowl (3 scoops) where I got the Hawaiian Tuna, Tuna and Spicy Tuna.  Yes, so i like tuna!  Every ingredient was fresh and the best quality.  I will defiantly be a regular at my new neighborhood poke bar.  BUT what I love also about this place is that they will be having a full Sake bar!!  I highly recommend going to Koi Poke Bar!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Such fresh fish and great topping options! I live in LA and no joke this is the best poke I have had and I have had a lot! I work sometimes in AZ and always come here when in town. The customer service and personal attention is so refreshing, immediately welcomed and they walk you through the process if you are new to it. Please come to CA! We need you Koi Poke!"}
{"text":"This poke place is tucked away in North Scottsdale shopping mall, and it was worth the drive.  All the ingredients were good quality including all the sides and presented well behind The counter. We enjoyed our poke bowls!

The restaurant including the drink & utensil sections were clean as week, but it would be tight to maneuver during busy + rush hour.  Luckily, we went for late lunch, so there were only 3-5 groups of diners there."}
{"text":"After researching various poke establishments this new Poke spot is probably one of the best in Scottsdale. All the fish is sushi grade and very fresh from sea to  table. Very clean and nice staff, especially Bridgette whom was very helpful explaining the menu. It just opened in May 2017, but it Poke is not short lived, with so many options. Ask for the spicy sauce. Marinated tuna and spicy tuna is awesome...Vegan options as well."}
{"text":"I ventured to Koi Poke after reading all of the high reviews on Yelp. And let me tell you it did not disappoint! The set up was similar to all the other poke places in the area, but you could taste the difference in the freshness of the ingredients. Definitely my go to poke place now!"}
{"text":"Incredible selection of sashimi & Poke - ready to go atop rice or greens, excellent teas too! Yum!"}
{"text":"Super good poke. I grew up in Southern California and am really picky about any sort of raw fish one may consume in the desert due to availability and location. They fly in their fish a few times a week and the quality of it is just incredible. Generous portions too for the money and the owner is a total sweetheart. I'm so impressed I actually came back the very next day for lunch again. That should be reason enough for you to come here and try it by now. If I could give more stars I would."}
{"text":"This is my favorite poke spot! Everything is always really fresh and they give good portion sizes. Also, the workers are always super friendly and attentive and let you sample the different proteins, sauces, etc. This is my go to spot when I'm hungry and need something quick. I come here often and have never been disappointed in anything."}
{"text":"Great place if you like Poke or sushi/Sashimi!  It's like Bi Bim Bop with sushi ingredients.  Super clean and staff are happy to give recommendations on getting started!  

5 of 5 and strongly recommended!  Try it out!"}
{"text":"Walked in here yesterday- this is what my mom requested for Mother's Day, that's how good this place is...and they were so patient and sweet with my husband and I while we were figuring out what we wanted as first-timers! The food is AMAZING! The service was OUTSTANDING! Needless to say, we will become the new regulars. The salmon and the Hawaiian Tuna were a huge hit in our house! We mixed the House sauce and the Spicy Shozu sauce- both total winners. Thanks Abbey, Troy, and Olivia for a great first experience! See you guys next time!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Ive been 3 times now. I've been to a handful of places that serve poke bowls in the valley and this one puts them all to shame!
The fish and ingredients taste very fresh and for the very decent price you get a really good amount of food! They offer different sizes in bowls which I think is really nice, and they have a large selection of toppings. I haven't been able to try their shaved ice yet, but I hear good things! Plus they have a nice bar. They also have a rewards program that gets you a free bowl after your 10th bowl which is a nice perk.
The place was very clean and the staff has been nothing but extremely friendly and professional every time I have come in!
I will definitely be making this place a regular stop for me! :)"}
{"text":"The best Poke bowl you can get. We really enjoyed the freshness and customer service. Going to visit Koi Poke again here very soon."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The fish tastes great and really fresh and there are a lot of different options and toppings that you can choose from. They also give you really generous portions"}
{"text":"I really like this place! The staff was super friendly and they give you a ton of options on toppings and flavored sauces. This was my first \"poke bowl\" experience.  I am visiting for works so I will definitely check out this spot again."}
{"text":"Best poke place I've found. I drive past many to come here every week. They offer a rice and veggie bowl for vegetarians, which is such a nice touch. Mix the house, spicy shoyu, and sriracha aioli. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Glad I trusted Yelp as always. Super fresh fish, very yummy toppings and sides and very helpful service. We're thinking about going back tomorrow."}
{"text":"With such a reasonable price at $10 for a small bowl, I wasn't sure how good this really was going to be but not only was it very delicious and fresh, you get a lot for your money. I would say a small bowl is more like two meals. The dressing was yummy and I love how there are so many toppings to select from at no additional cost including crab. We had the snow desert after which was light and refreshing. I think I'm going to have to go here once a week at least. It's so good!"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious poke.  Totally impressed with the quality of the fish here and the service is amazing.  They are kind enough to let you try the fish and other toppings if you're unsure what you want.  Very generous servings of all the toppings."}
{"text":"Really huge fan of this place. Pleasant wait staff and really fresh options. We were driving down to a popular Ahi Poke place in S Scottsdale but so glad to find something so yummy up north!!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch yet again at Koi Poke. You have to try it. It is absolutely worth it. I love how fresh all their seafood is."}
{"text":"excellent service, food is very good, plenty of options. good price. I recommend, And I'll be back in this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Best poke bar in Arizona. The food is so amazing and so tasty and fresh. If you love sushi this is the place to go. Love the concept of how you can build  your own bowl. My first time trying this place was Tuesday September 5th and loved it so much I went back on Friday September 8th twice in one week. That's how tasty and fresh the food is. And most importantly the staff are so professional and nice always helpful and smiling,  this restaurant is top notch in customer service.That is what I look for because you can have amazing food but if the staff is not professional people will look elsewhere however this place tops of many restaurants in customer service. Plus the food is amazing and inside is so clean. The staff should be so proud of themselves and the owners should be so proud of their staff. Next time I am in I will ask if I am able to email the owners just to let them know how happy i am with the service and food. This place has gained a loyal customer."}
{"text":"This place is great!! It's deconstructed sushi made to order like Chipotle. I went there around 8ish and they were super friendly and funny. The guy behind the counter recommended some sauce for me which was just delicious and when I got home and ate the whole thing I could not have been more satisfied.

To be clear I am writing a review of the bowl half, there is also a bar section with more seating that was closed when I went."}
{"text":"Think Chipotle mated with Sushi and had a baby! That's what this place is like! You get to choose Brown or White rice then build your bowl from there. You get to choose your protein and how many scoops depending on the size of your bowl. 

With many amazing proteins and toppings you can create many different bowls. The best part is choosing the sauce. I must say it was hard to decide on which one to choose so, I'll be back to try them all. 

I purchased the Large Bowl and added avocado ($2.00). My bill came to $17 which is a bit high but the bowl was filling and tasty. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I'll be able to go anywhere else for poke now...  it's so good.  Staff was super friendly and the comfy booths made it a great spot to relax while eating lunch.  

The layout is a tad confusing.  I walked in and saw a bunch of tables and bar that looked closed.  I thought I might have walked into the wrong place but I hadn't.  Walk over to the right and you'll find the poke.   

I'm already scheming about my next visit..."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, great choices, awesome service...healthy, clean, fabulous eating!!! I've had poke in Hawaii...and this was BETTER.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is decent but not my favorite.  

I think the poke is outstanding, fresh, and high quality. My issue is that they put this great poke on top of steaming hot brown rice (my selected option as you can get white rice or greens) which seems really odd to have raw cold fish on top of very hot rice.  Other poke places serve it over cold rice.

The toppings are decent but not outstanding, though there is an unique variety.  The last time, I also had the crab. I asked if it was real crab and was assured it was but I can't believe that it is - it's seems like the fake Krab - and the amount of mayo in it is way too much."}
{"text":"So fresh and delicious! Friendly staff and lots of GF sauce options as well. I'll definitely be returning (probably tomorrow!)"}
{"text":"Seafood has always been my favorite type of food. Growing up in Seattle I had no shortage of fresh fish, Arizona however can be a little more tricky to find. I've tried lots of Poke places around the Valley and this is by far the best! I work at a high end sushi restaurant and know quality, this place has very good quality. The bowl I got was half brown rice, half spring mix, 3 scoops (Hawaiian Tuna, Yellowtail, and Salmon) , citrus ponzu and spicy shoyu sauces, with a very of toppings! Super delicious."}
{"text":"Holy cows! This place is great! So fast, so fresh, so friendly. Go here.  the salad and rice was excellent and the fish was perfect. Unlimited toppings and perfect service."}
{"text":"Beautiful modern interior. Customer service was very helpful since this is only my third time having a poke Bowl. She explained everything very patiently. It was nice to see that it was very clean in there the food was very presentable filled neatly. I was also offered to a sample of the spicy tuna which is so nice and also delicious! 
Can't wait to try more of their choice. 
I do wish they could have given me a little bit of ice to take home to help preserve my poke Bowl .
I also have to add when I got it home my poke Bowl was amazing everything was  so fresh and I loved everything. she even put the rice in a separate bowl for me to take to work the next day. I can't go back  to try the lobster!!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and welcoming! Poki bowl was delicious. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best poke in Scottsdale hand down plus they have fresh iced tea! The rice is much more moist then other places I have tried. Favorite poke spot for sure! The service is also excellent! Very friendly and clean!"}
{"text":"Awesome concept.  Fresh ingredients and awesome fish. Like a Chipotle but with Poke...and 100x better!!!  Will come back every time I am in PHX area."}
{"text":"As far as poké places go this one is in the middle of the road. They didn't have a \"special\" or \"unique\" topping or sauce that differentiates them from other places. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because the fish was very fresh (I got the tuna and salmon), I liked how they put the toppings on top of the rice (Some places put it off to the side), and the restaurant was very clean with a lot of bathrooms. I wouldn't go out of my way for koi poké. However, the staff were very nice and always checking to see how we were doing!"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale and had a hankering for sashimi. Found this place on Yelp and absolutely LOVE it! I had a small bowl with field greens, salmon & yellowtail, krab salad, smelt eggs and seaweed salad. A lot of food! Delicious and affordable! I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I love Koi! It's the best poke place in the valley! Everything tastes really fresh and they give you large portions of the proteins and sides. I don't feel I'm being cheated out when I eat there. I respect the fact the owner is there often and works behind the counter. You don't always see that and he makes sure all the customers are happy! I recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal!"}
{"text":"This place continues to deliver. Two months in and I've been here 97878 times. Okay that might be a bit of an exaggeration. The quality continues to be second to none. A lot of places will start to go downhill or give you smaller portions. Not Koi.  The staff is always friendly and happy to have you here.  Come here. Eat here. Still 5 stars. 

Update: the fish here rivals that of the best sushi places in the valley. I was curious how a fast casual place could successfully merge with a full bar and Koi figured it out. Come with friends for a chill night out or come to watch a game. This place will only to continue to gain traction here in the lacking N. Scottsdale scene. 

Absolutely love this place. Have had my share of Poke and this one takes the cake. The fish taste so insanely fresh. I have been here a handful of times and it has been on point each and every time. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly which is a breath of fresh air these days. Now that the bar is open, it adds an entire different element. Do not overlook this gem.  

Update 8/4 so this place continues to deliver. Did you know the drinks are half off all summer? Yea. All day, all summer. The portions are plentiful and fresh beyond explanation. Do not pass this place up. Yes, I have an issue. I've checked in 20 times here and it's just as good as the first day I had it."}
{"text":"First time here the other night. Was awesome! Food was delicious, fish was fresh, and the staff were extremely courteous and professional. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Had a coworker pick some up for me before they closed and got crab and salmon and it's amazing!! I'll have to actually go inside next time :)! 

5/19/17- just tried their Hawaiian shaved ice and it was so yummy! Glad to have a place close to home like this"}
{"text":"OMG this place is the BEST!! I've never tasted anything SO fresh and delicious! Healthy, tasty and quick, It doesn't get any better than this! I love the decor, the cleanliness and the staff was awesome! I rarely give 5 stars but I would give more if I could to Koi!"}
{"text":"So yummy! Fresh, delicious food reasonably priced. Many different options on how to create your bowl. New favorite place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!

They took a very basic concept and made it something unique and special!

The staff are super friendly and the food in SUPER fresh!! 

I loved their bathroom layout and how simple they kept everything. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best poke places I have been. We just came from Hawaii where we had poke there. This place tops it. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing. The service was awesome and very friendly. They had freshly brewed iced teas that tasted great. Highly recommend. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"My favorite poke spot in the valley. 
The quality and taste of the food is amazing!! The option and selection are great."}
{"text":"Happy. Happy. Joy. Joy. My poke BFF and I visited Koi Poke for the very first time today and we were super excited to have found this gem. Poke heaven. There are two doors to the establishment. One is the Poke Bar where you'll find sit down service and a full bar. The other door is The Poke Bowl entrance where you get to stand in line and choose your base, protein, and toppings. *They will let you sample the protein but don't get all sample crazy and ruin it for everyone else people!*  The tuna and salmon is what I chose and it was so FRESH and melted like buttttta in my mouth. They have a nice selection of toppings and everything is super fresh. Edamame, seaweed salad, cucumbers/cucumber salad, red and green onion, ginger, shaved brussel sprouts, kale - the list goes on.  The crab salad is wonderful and they do not use imitation crab so that second scoop for $1.  is well worth the extra coin. They also have dry toppings, such as sesame seeds and  crispy garlic (TRY IT, its amazing.) 

They also have Hawaiian shaved ice for the kids or the kid found in all adults. Nice selection of freshly brewed ice tea as well. 

If you love Poke like my partner in crime and I do, you've gotta stop by Koi Poke. Great food, great vibe and awesome customer service."}
{"text":"Seriously Amazing!  Highly recommend and can't wait to go back!  One of the best places to eat.  The place was super clean! They are gluten free friendly!!!  So healthy too!  Deconstructed sushi and the coolest place!"}
{"text":"i've had quite a bit of poke in my time and this is definitely up there.  great selection and good sauces too.  Pretty fairly priced and the lady was proud to say that the crab meat was REAL crab and only a $1 for an extra scoop of it!"}
{"text":"Okay guys. Really love your place.  Love the food. But who is in charge. Monday the 11th of December walked in and walked right out. Immediately the very very strong smell of bleach was wofting. So strong immediately my eyes stung. I have asthma. It also set off an attack. Who had any brains to do that while you are open."}
{"text":"I'm motivated by Koi. This place is amazing. Some of the best poke in Arizona. The staff is super nice. The owners are involved on the front lines (I know this because I asked) and by the way they took pride in serving I could tell it was different. The restaurant is clean, contemporary, simple, and the food is phenomenal. 

The options for the price are a great value. The fish is always fresh and I haven't had one bad experience here. This specific location is a little out of the way for me personally but definitely worth it. I know they are building more around the valley and popping up everywhere. So I'm excited to have more experiences closer to me. 

The Hawaiian Ahi which is already seasoned is moneeeeeyyyy!!! The other proteins are just as fresh and they have multiple options. I love all the choices they have as far as sauces go. I mix almost all of them for a crazy concoction of sauce madness. The additional sides like seaweed salad and crab mix is included and wow what a great mix on the palette. I usually get a 3 or 4 scoop size and I'm full every time. 

If you like poke, you have to try this place for real. Great experience all the way around."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Some of the best seafood I've ever had at any level of restaurant. Great variety of toppings and sauces to choose from. For being so new the secret is already out the place was packed on Thursday at noon. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Had dinner, with wine, tonight.  Nice vibe and decor. Amazing quality of fish and fresh ingredients. This place is fantastic.  Having just bought home in N Scottsdale, happy to have it nearby. (I lived in NY and Tokyo!)"}
{"text":"I'm back again and this time we got one of the karma juices blonde with another great poki Bowl"}
{"text":"Super solid poke place and they give generous portions of the toppings-including masago-practically an ice cream scoop of it  the house sauce was kind of lackluster but would go back to try a different sauce!"}
{"text":"First time dining here.  Food was fantastic and the service was great.   The counter help was very friendly and helpful.   The poke varieties were excellent, and we would return to dine here again"}
{"text":"Came here solo for lunch. Been looking forward to this place opening. Overall very good, but a few misses for me. 

The prices are higher since this is north Scottsdale. The poke bar which is on 2 miles away on shea and Scottsdale is 2 bucks cheaper and has better offerings for addins, but this place could be as good with some additional addins and fixing the things I suggest below. 

I had the medium bowl $12.95: 3 scoops of protein. The protein offerings are solid. Same as every other good place. They have lobster as an add on for 4 dollars, but not sure if that is worth it. 

The other addins could use corn, and I would recomend that the crab be free for 2 scoops and not $1 dollar extra. Also I prefer sushi rice. They seem to be using long grain which is not as favorable. Also please use a bowl that does does not melt when the rice is put in it. That releases nasty chemicals into my food that I don't need.
Mangement: I suggest you check out poke bar on shea. That place does it the best at this time imo. Also really pack in the protein by smashing the scoop on the side of the bowl. It probably doesn't add that much protein, but the places that do this make me feel they are really trying to give me the max or slightly more. This can help especially with you higher prices. :)

The bathrooms were spotless. They also have a full alcohol bar which will be great for the evenings. 

It is these little things  that keep me from giving it a 5/5. 

Service was 5/5. Overall 3/5."}
{"text":"Holy cow this place was great. Really fresh fish. Vegetarian options. Delicious sauces. Helpful staff. Fair prices. The small was more than enough for me. 
I had the Hawaiian style tuna with spring mix and citrus ponzu. It was fantastic. Highly rec."}
{"text":"Best poke in North Scottsdale!! Fresh ingredients, friendly staff, and they even have a reward program. Buy 10 poke bowls and get a small bowl for free! From now on, I will only come to Koi poke instead of Poke Spot at Grayhawk plaza, Koi is simply better."}
{"text":"Will definitely go back here. 10$ for a small bowl but it comes with two scoops of finish and unlimited toppings. Nice environment and really good customer service. You can dine in or go on the faster side. Really good poke, get the spicy shoyu sauce it's soooo good."}
{"text":"Just pounded some serious poke. I was a 1st timer today. Best poke bowl I've ever had. Staff was super nice, pleasant and hospitable even at the end of a hot summer day when I could understand being a little poke'd out. But they weren't. They were great, the vibe was great and the food was wonderful. See you soon and thank you."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how terrific this place is! There poke is so fresh and the owners Tommy & Sara are so wonderful. Super friendly team (Chris is so nice!) The restaurant is sparkling clean, beautifully designed & the super fresh food is amazing. Go!!!"}
{"text":"First off, 2 thumbs up to the staff for being patient and extremely knowledgeable about the different tastes of each option!!

Second, amazing fresh fish and really plentiful options to add! I got a small bowl that was overflowing at the end and it was simply delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of fish in general but I tried the food here and loved it! It's very flavorful and the portions are very generous!"}
{"text":"Very clean,fresh comfortable energetic atmosphere coupled with great tasting food and extremely friendly service!
I've eaten at other poke restaurants but the food at\" Koi Poke\" is extremely fresh and flavorful which has caused a problem because I Can't seem to get enough. Each time I visit the staff is very pleasant, attentive and treat me as though I'm the only customer there. Good food ! Good service ! Good price ! I'm hooked ! Thanks for making the dining experience pleasant again."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place! Fresh delicious food, clean environment and friendly staff. I wish they would open one near me in the Desert Ridge area."}
{"text":"So Ono! So good.. location is ok but the place pretty awesome. Great staff to take care of you especially for the first timers. The bowl was small for a medium but that didn't stop me from eating everything out of that bowl."}
{"text":"Fresh. On the costly side for the portions they give. The bowl is not big enough compared to other poke places in Phoenix and in USA. Overall very clean. No foul smell from tuna, salmon or sea weed."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in a mini mall!  The food is amazing & fresh.  The staff are sooooo nice!!!  The ambience is great too & they make it so easy to take your leftovers home with you.  However, so far, I have yet to not eat all of it, the food is so brilliant!  And as for the mini mall, there are several great destinations there like MD Skin The Lounge, Luster Nail Spa & a place to have all your waxing needs taken care of, you really must visit this place! Off the charts GREAT!"}
{"text":"This was my first time having Poke and it was great. I love all the choices to make it how you like and everything tastes very fresh and tasty. I'm sure it takes some sampling to figure out the right combination. I wish I had the name of the gentleman who waited on us - he was very friendly, patient and helpful - explaining things and letting us sample. My daughter wasn't as thrilled but I think she would have liked it better if she'd gotten a different sauce. And it's the kind of set up where you may feel a little pressure to make quick decisions if there is a line. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for healthy, creative sushi bowls.  The Hawaiian tuna and spicy tuna are delicious.  After selecting your fish you can chose from white or brown rice to rest it on followed by garnishings from ginger to seaweed salad.  Then, top it off with toasted garlic and a spicy shoyu sauce.  Absolutely, delightful!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with some friends for the first time and I will definitely be back!  Everything was so fresh and delicious. I'm very particular about fish but their Hawaiian Tuna and yellowtail with spicy sauce were amazing."}
{"text":"Came for a return visit after a not so wonderful service experience a short few days ago. 
I had provided feedback to the owners thru Yelp and heard back from Sarah (she and her husband own the place. First time restaurateurs).
So impressed this time with the service. Tommy behind the bar is a beast: superlative service and all about customer satisfaction. 
It warms my heart as a foodie that folks like Sarah and her spouse are making a difference in the culinary experience in this neighborhood. 
Of course, the food is fantastic. 
Bravo!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The fish is always fresh. The sauces are amazing. The bowl sizes for th money are very good. I love the set up. You go in, select your bowl size, select your fish, select your sauces, then toppings and you're done. Very easy!"}
{"text":"Five star quality of fish! 

Came here on day 2 of their Grand Opening, and pleasantly surprised with quality of fish they use here. I tried Hawaiian tune, Yellowtail and Salmon. My favorite was yellowtail. Yellowtail quality was so good, melt in my mouth quality good.

It was Day 2 on Grand Opening, perhaps staff is still being trained or decor is still needs to be finished up. (Booth chairs with no tables???)

Hawaiian tuna is already marinated and should be served as is but she started mixing up with other fish. 

It was so new friends came over and started chatting about their family. While it was nice to see their friends came to support newly opened business but I had to wait while they chatted.  All the staff was very friendly with nice smiles.

Koi here means love. I really liked the way they decorated two of their walls with heart. Prior to my visit, I thought koi meant koi fish (carp). 

They use gluten free soy. If you are not sure what you like, they let you sample fish and/or sauce to make sure you really like the food.

Since their food was very good, I would like to come back but will wait a month or so until initial grand opening hiccups are all smooth out."}
{"text":"I love the place. The seafood servings are generous and so are the toppings. I like this place way better than ahi poki but this place is only close to my apartment not work."}
{"text":"I tried this place last night and was very impressed. I live in DC Ranch and eat Pok? a lot. No more trekking 16 miles back and forth to Shea and Scottsdale Road!

Koi Pok? has the most fresh fish I have ever had other than being in Hawaii. I had the yellowtail and regular tuna and it was insane good! They gave me a sample of the yellowtail on a little tasting skewer before I ordered with no sauce or seasoning on it and it melted in my mouth and tasted amazing. You know it's fresh when you can eat a piece of raw, plain fish and it tastes great.

They also gave me samples of whatever sauces they have before I ordered and I have to say it was a difficult decision because they were all great! But the Spicy Shoyu and the House were incredible

I went with the House and will try the Spicy Shoyu next time.Super friendly staff and very cool atmosphere too. By far the best Pok? place in town and I've tried them all!

OK I've now been here a few times and just tried the Hawaiian Snow Ice - Pina Colava (not a typo, but a play on words being Hawaiian and all), get it...volcano? Anyway sorry for the rant, it was delicious! Coconut flavored snow ice with coconut flakes, fresh pineapple and caramel. So so tasty.

Also, I just read  a couple of these reviews that are complaining about the rice. With all due respect to my fellow yelpers, Pok? is not supposed to be served with sushi rice and every single one of the other Pok? places I have frequented for more than a decade around the world, including more recently the other places here in town do not use sushi rice. Personally I've never seen brown sushi (or sticky) rice which in and of itself proves the point. Most if not all Pok? places serve brown rice in addition to white. 

To Koi management, just keep on truckin, you guys rock in my book!

The bowl I just ate before dessert which was my third here had perfect rice in terms of texture and temperature."}
{"text":"Really good.  Got Hawaiian tuna and yellowtail, both were quality and mixed well with the various sauces on hand.  The crispy onions and garlic were nice garnish.  Portion size is a bit skimpy compared to what I remember from Hawaii, but this is Phoenix so should I be surprised?  A bit bummed they didn't have the sno machine.  The way the kid at the counter responded, he acted like I should have known - maybe put up a sign?"}
{"text":"Koi poke bowl just opened near my house in windgate ranch. The bowls are amazing and the tuna is very fresh I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Best Poke in town!!! I can't get enough of this place! 
I used to live in Japan so I've being spoiled with some of the  best sushi you could ever have and I have to say this place has the best quality sushi I've had since coming back from Japan. 

I'm so happy I found it. I usually get the bowl with tuna, Salmon and load it up with all the sides that can fit the crab is extra but it's REAL and amazing. 
The bowl looks small but it is actually pretty big. I can't never seem to finished it. Its price perfectly. You can't get this high quality sushi for this cheap any where else in town. I would highly recommend to anyone I know!!"}
{"text":"I love having sushi in a bowl. It's such a treat to go to places like this. This place was great for the service and their fresh choices. I always prefer to get the spicier sauces and the spicy fish when I go to sushi places or poke places and their spicy tuna was delicious. It is kind of expensive if you want more proteins and my fiancé decided to get an $8 drink and the guy at the cashier told her they were that much and my eyes got wide and she looked at me and said \"Please!\" And I gave in and bought it for her, she said it was worth it even though it was only a couple of gulps. This place is very cool inside, they have a bar, and the food is delicious. The service is just as good as the store. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Hands down this place is amazing. The selection is huge the portions are good and the variety of options are amazing. The staff were extremely welcoming and helped us make our selections, I give them six stars. This is a must-try restaurant."}
{"text":"Thanks Chris and crew for an amazing and consistently tasty Poke' experience.   Your staff and your food are deserving of Best of the Valley honors.   Ultra fresh and flavor-rich sushi, rice and toppings."}
{"text":"Amazing food! First time trying this restaurant and it was so good. Definitely will eat here often. I got the small. Good size portion almost too much protein if that is possible! Fresh toppings, great friendly service!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Brand new. Clean, well kept, food was fresh and flavorful. One of the best poke bowls I've ever had, the options for toppings are great and you can choose whatever you want for toppings which is awesome!. A little pricey but worth it. The small bowl was very filling. They could have explained how to make a bowl in person but I
Figured it out using the directions on the wall. Also some other reviews mentioned there rice needed to be stickier, I am happy to report it is perfectly sticky amazing actually which means they are reading reviews and listening and making changes as needed, that is a great sign of good business practices! If this place maintains its high food quality standards, and cleanliness I believe it will be a great success. Shaved ice was awesome!

Update: second time here 6/4/17
Even better the second time. The staff is so kind and so patient. The place is so clean, and the food is amazing. Love it here. Love love love it. My dad came with me this time, he's allergic to garlic and onions and one staff member even went in the back and got the ingredient list for every sauce to make sure my dad was safe to consume it. This staff member did so with  a smile on his face. There kindness is one of the reasons to come back! Great staff amazing food I hope this place sticks around"}
{"text":"I liked the food but there are other poke bars that have the same quality sushi and give you a lot more for your money. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time yesterday.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Poke bowl was very fresh and a good serving size.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is a great poke place in Scottsdale. Location is convenient. The restaurant is clean and modern. Service is very good. I ordered a medium size with greens and brown rice. I was quite full after. My proteins were yellowtail Hawaiian tuna and spicy tuna. The portions were fair.  They have a number of sides to choose from. The crab salad is w real crab meat. Avocados are extra. They were generous with the sides this time. Last time I was here they were a little skimpy. They also have many sauces to choose from. The proteins were fresh the flavors were good.  The bathroom was spacious well designed and clean. I have been coming here for a while and enjoy coming here.  The price is reasonable considering the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and I was very happy with my experience.  My friend and I sat at the bar and ordered a drink as we perused the menu.  We asked questions and tried a couple samples.  The we ordered our bowls and enjoyed every bite.  The fish was very fresh and buttery.  We tried a few sauces before deciding.  The house is everything you'd expect and want for an Asian marinade.  Delish!  
The owner introduced himself and gave us a little background.  Great sourcing of ingredients and nice atmosphere?.  Can't wait to come back.  Amazing meal for the money.  Will return often."}
{"text":"Lots of Poke places popping up locally and they are going to need to step up their game to compete. Service and ingredients are good, but nothing about this place stands out. Some of the other more established powerhouses like the ones in chandler and on Scottsdale road and Thomas are going to have a much better experience, as they have perfected the process, and have better topping choices, and better sauces. This place isn't a failure, but it can do better. Also, you need Thai iced tea. I know Poke is Hawaiian, but the flavors go so well with Poke and it's super cheap to make."}
{"text":"Koi Poke has my heart and my pallet. When you first walk in the atmosphere is inviting and the staff is very friendly. If you're new they help you with suggestions and samples without making you feel like a nuisance. Unlike other poke places, it doesn't wreak in here of old fish which I appreciate. 

The portions are better than any place I've visited and they actually fill up the whole scoop. Candice was very helpful in recommending flavors that pair well together. 

I got a medium sized bowl (3 scoops) with spicy tuna, Hawaiian tuna and shrimp in sesame oil. I topped it off with spicy ponzu sauce, avocado, edamame, cucumbers, crab, masago and sesame seeds. My bowl was overflowing! 

Is your mouth watering yet? 

Will definitely be back, you go Koi Poke!"}
{"text":"This is the best poke in town. However, it is expensive. I'm assuming it's because it's in the DC Ranch area / they never get a chance to really utilize their bar. Great selection and very clean. Recommend to anyone who hasn't tried them out before!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to have dinner at the Decantur which was the previous restaurant at this location with same ownership.  Decantur offered healthy delicious food. I was bummed when I found out that Decantur closed.  However much to my delight, a few months later, Koi Poke replaced Decantur.  Both fish and condiments were fresh and well prepared.  The restaurant is bright, hip and cheery.  The staff is highly attentive and the prices are reasonable.  I know a few reviewers felt the prices are high.  I personally don't feel Koi Poke is overpriced, let's face it...commercial spaces north of 101 are expensive, especially in DC Ranch area.  I'd much rather stay around DC Ranch than drive to Shea where traffic can be dicey and congested."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! A lot of food for your money. Never buy sushi rolls again just come here and get s bowl with anything you want on it. I wish they had these in St. Pete Fl"}
{"text":"The best poke in town! You've gotta get the lobster with champagne butter sauce. Also, great selection of iced tea. I had the pineapple green tea; it was delicious and refreshing. Service was good and fast. 

I literally had no complaints. My new poke spot!"}
{"text":"It was very nice dealing with staff......they were very helpful .......I brought one home for her with LOBSTER as we just moved her from Boston"}
{"text":"Excellent! Fresh fresh fresh. Tasty tasty tasty. The staff is consistently happy and helpful. Yes, it's pricier but the quality of food, amount of ingredients, and consistency is worth the extra dollar or 2."}
{"text":"The poke is great. The staff is friendly BUT they are using plastic bowls! Hundreds of them that can not be recycled .
Not environmentally friendly which is odd for a new trendy restaurant. There are others that use recyclable cardboard which makes ya feel better than stuffing a plastic container into the garbage.  I won't be back because of this. Hopefully they will change at some point."}
{"text":"We've been here twice; great experience here. Food was fresh and tasty and the service was friendly, patient and attentive. Jamie patiently walked us through the process of assembling our bowls. After we started eating our food she heard me say to my husband that we should have added seaweed. She graciously came over and offered us the seaweed in a little container. That was great customer service, to go the extra mile. 
One thing that sets this place apart from the numerous other poke bowl places is that they use real crab meat. This alone will keep me coming back. I think the prices are very reasonable for all that you get. 
If I had to make suggestions for improvement, it would be to use sushi rice instead of long grain rice like another reviewer said. I liked the cut of yellowtail better than the cut of tuna; both were very fresh but the tuna was a tad stringy. I also got confused by the \"sides\" on the menu board. I now know it is just more stuff they put in your bowl and that the crab scoop is in addition to the proteins you pick in the beginning. 
Anyhow, glad we found this place and we look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. The Hawaiian tuna is my new go to. Portion size is right and the fish is cold and delicious. Looking forward to going back and trying the different sauce selections. This is my new favorite North Scottsdale spot."}
{"text":"They have great food and great quality. It's a very upscale casual hangout place. I will definitely recommend this place. The owners were very friendly and awesome"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat! I've had poke at other places but koi's is always the best. Also the staff is always super friendly which I appreciate!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is very nice. You get such a cool refreshing feel upon entering the establishment. The presentation at the bar is easy to understand.  I enjoyed everything personally! Give it it a try."}
{"text":"I just recently tried Koi Poke after it was recommended to me. Absolutely delicious. Fresh fish, flavorful. Unique options- the only poke place I have been offered shaved brussel sprouts! 

The bowls are beautiful, and presentation is much nicer than other poke places I have been. The staff is extremely nice! 

Yes, the crab is a must have when visiting!"}
{"text":"We made our first (and so far only) visit to Koi Poke last week.  We are both avid sushi fans and poke fans and were excited to have a place so close to us to get our fill of poke.  The place itself is very nice, modern design and and interesting set-up of a half sit down/bar, half quick to-go style service.  I don't think the restaurant/bar part was open yet, or at least it didn't appear that it was.  We went for a couple poke bowls to go.

We were met with a smile and greeting from the staff behind the service counter.  There was one couple in front of us so I figured we would be in and out of there quickly.  That wasn't the case.  I'm sure much of this was due to the newness of the business, but I think it was problematic that the staff offered and encouraged the customer to try/sample everything.  That's nice in terms of customer service, but it slowed down the process to a snail-crawl, especially when they are sampling 3 or 4 sauces, each being poured individually.  If we were the only people there, it wouldn't be a big deal.  But as we waited in line, a line began to form behind us and continued to grow.  In the era of places like chipotle, people expect quick service from a place set up like Koi Poke.  

The ordering process is fairly easy and straight forward, but you could tell the staff was still getting comfortable with the process.  It all felt a bit awkward.  There was a teenage male working along with who I assume were the owners.  He had mixed the Hawaiian tuna with another sauce, to which the guy working the registered told him \"next time don't mix this with other sauces\" right in front of the ordering customer.  It wasn't a big deal, but it certainly was awkward to hear and watch.  

The food itself was good, the fish was fresh and they offer a decent variety of toppings and sauces.  Their prices do seem a bit high for what you get.  The only issue with the food was the rice.  It wasn't bad at all, but it wasn't sushi rice.  It didn't hold together well like sushi rice normally does, which made it hard to eat with chopsticks.  We both agreed that the rice didn't really work and were not what we expected from a poke place.  I think another reviewer commented on the same issue with the rice.  It wasn't bad, just don't think it was the right rice.

I think many of the issues discussed above with be fixed with time and experience.  We will probably be back at some point, but our first experience didn't leave us craving another bowl."}
{"text":"AH! This place is to die for! Everything is super fresh. I eat here almost every single week and I have never once been disappointed. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food !! I enjoy Poke food anytime I can get it . I have yet to experience poke fish with sushi quality until I came to Koi Poke ! Game changer can't wait to return for more Sushi Poke ! Back for more and more"}
{"text":"Great service by the guys working tonight !! ( Sunday October 1st). They were super kind and welcoming! The food on top of that was BOMB. The whole restaurant is basically gluten free- they have so many tasty options that are still healthy! When they found out that one of the few things was not gluten free they remade our bowl. We live next door and can't wait to come back. They definitely won us over here with the great food, service and prices!!!"}
{"text":"Soooo good! I wish all poke places had a few more selection for sides and that they cut their cucumbers slightly smaller, but other than that, it's fairly priced and great quality! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! So glad I was able to stop here on my recent trip back to Scottsdale! This is such a gem of a spot! The ingredients are so fresh and the portions are great! The staff were very helpful and nice! I've had poke before but my friend had never been before. Stephen helped her make a yummy bowl and even offered a sample of some of the sauces as to make the best decision. We both loved our bowls and can't wait to go back! Thank you for opening such a great place! 
Oh! They also have a bar which is awesome!! We sipped on our wine and had a great time!"}
{"text":"Amazing fish very fresh and Mikes customer service was 5 star all the way. Stop by for poke you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! If you love sushi but want it made your way in a bowl with unlimited healthy toppings, this is your place! I had lunch there for the first time with a friend this week, we both absolutely loved it! The owner came up and introduced himself with a proud smile. I really wish them a great success as they've done a great job launching this new beautiful concept!"}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations! My wife and my family have bounced around to a few Poke bar/ Chipotle  style poke restaurants around the valley and Koi Poke stands out and above the rest. One side is for the on the run , pick your stuff and go. On the other  half  of the restaurant you can sit down, relax and they will take your order and serve you that wine or four peaks beer at the bar. I also love the sauces to choose from for the bowl, my favorite was the spicy shoyu. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious sushi grade fish. Lots of fresh topping choices. Friendly staff. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great create your own poke bowl concept. Fish and veggies are fresh. Sizes come in small $10, medium $12 and large $14. You get 2 scoops of protien on a small, 3 on a med and 4 on a large. I got a small bowl and this portion size was very filling, defitintely not a size to share though. You can choose white/ brown rice or salad for your base. I tried their Hawaiian ahi tuna. Not like traditional Hawaiian ahi poke because it doesn't have the Maui red onions. This was actually perfect for me since I can't have the red onions. Overall my bowl consisted of white rice, hawaiian ahi tuna, regular ahi tuna, cucumber, sesame oil, siracha aioli and avacodo ($2 up charge). Everything tasted really good. 

Pricing is really high compared to other poke places in AZ and even HI! Understandably so since the restuarant is located in the DC ranch crossing shopping plaza in North Scottsdale. I was also informed by the owner that they air in fish from Japan to CA and then have it sent directly to their kitchen. From her knowledge there is no other Poke place in the valley that does this.

During my poke bowl creation I noticed that they have unique snow bowls. I decided to stop back by later to try out one of their snow bowls. They have 3 different bowls to choose from. Some come with bobas, coconut and banana flavored snow, different types of syrups/sauces and fruit. My friend and I decided to share a banana cream dream with banana flavored snow, cookie crumble, coconut flakes, caramel syrup, white chocolate and then we added pineapple. Snow bowls run $6 a bowl with no options on bowl size. Portions are very large and shareable. Defitinely wish you could create your own bowl like you can with the poke bowls. I found out later from the business owner that you can create your own snow ice bowl with the ingredients they have if you simply just ask. Snow is a little sweeter than I like but not too sweet that we couldn't finish the whole bowl. The snow tasted like it was made with real bananas.

Both times we were there we only saw 1 or 2 couples in the restuarant. It was not busy at all and seemed odd for a saturday afternoon but then I remembered it was a holiday weekend and I am sure most people are out of town. Great for us, we got our food super fast. Defitinely will try this place again but wish they did lunch or happy hour poke deals. A little pricey spending $14 on lunch. They do give you points towards future bowls if you text a specific code you get on your receipt to a particular number. Not sure how many points get you what but I guess I will just have to find out...."}
{"text":"I wish they had scallops and the avocado was cut up in the salad. Other than my first world problems, this place is making it on my list regular lunch places. 

I got a small bowl with salad, tuna, shrimp, crispy garlic (which is fantastic), sriracha aioli, avocado, and a nice mix of the toppings. The fish was fresh and the portion was more than enough."}
{"text":"The service here was excellent and quick, and the food was delicious. Every time I have come in I am greeted with a smile and the food is always fresh and prepared to my liking. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes a healthy and tasty meal."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've tried \"poke bowl\" and I'm so glad this is the firstbplace I tried. The staff were friendly, very understanding about my first time and explaining in depth the menu and had awesome recommendations. I tried the brown rice, Hawaii tuna, shrimp and a few recommended sauces and it was AMAZING. I walked away so satisfied! We also tried the boba berry desert! It was absolutely delicious! Five stars!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! All of the seafood is fresh and not frozen on site. All the seafood was actually in the ocean in Japan 3 days before, I was blown away by that. Super fresh ingredients, nice open space, good price, modern looking. I scarfed mine down and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great portions.  Awesome fresh fish and great service.  Too bad it was lunch or I would of paired it with Bubbles!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best poke bar in the city. I drove 30 minutes today (past many other poke places) to come here because it is THAT good. I've never liked crab bc it's usually fake and this isn't. They said every fish came out of the ocean 72 hours ago or less. This is the holy grail. I get the Hawaiian tuna & all their sauce options make it so yummy so you can make it taste different every time. And they're fast! No bad things to say about this place - I will never to anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Best new poke place in Scottsdale  Everything was fresh and there were a lot of variety toppings."}
{"text":"Came in with a friend for the first time and was throughly impressed! Back in for the 8th time and still impressed! The quality and presentation is amazing! The vibe, ambiance and decor on point. The freshness and choices are amazing. I'm a fan and love tis location. 
Staff is friendly helpful and ready to help with any questions or needs. 
In a world full of poke places, this one is TOPS!"}
{"text":"I can't help but tell the truth most of the time. And, I must say this place is fantastic!! The sushi is 2-days from catch to delivery. The crab and lobster are real, not imitation. The brown rice is chewy and nutty. All of the ingredients are their absolute freshest. Can't wait to try the Hawaiian Ice and a new light, fresh and skinny cocktail from the full bar which will be open \"any day\" now. Keep up the awesome work! And see you real soon."}
{"text":"Hard to put into words just how amazing this Poke spot is. Upon walking in I was greeted by the staff behind the bar and was asked if I wanted to sample any of the fresh fish. I loved that I got to taste the different proteins, this way I knew which one  I wanted! I have dined at SEVERAL poke spots before but this place is unreal!!! You get SO much food, no skimping here! Also, it is bright, clean, modern and chic! I will probably only dine at Koi Poke from here on out... I was SO impressed!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating poke and it's was delicious.  The owner informed me it's flown in fresh every day. Loved all the choices for the toppings!   Everyone was very friendly too. The owner did say starting at 3pm is a service at your table with glass bowls/silverware.  I think it would be nice to combine the service together.  Offer glass/silverware for orders for eating in.  Offer plastic bowls and plastic ware for to go.  3pm and later could change to service at table with the bar.  Salad taste better in glass and real silverware.  Other then that, it was great.   Tasted Very Fresh and it's was flown in that day."}
{"text":"Best poke place we've tried in the Phoenix area.   I had the Hawaiian tuna and salmon and both were fresh and well prepared.  The adds were very good and there were a lot of options. Portions were very good.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is the best poke place in town! The food is really fresh and a great value. The only thing that hurts the digestion is the overly upbeat edm music constantly playing."}
{"text":"This is the best Poke restaurant in the Scottsdale area hands down. The Hawaiian tuna with the sriracha aioli is the perfect combination! Although there are more and more of these places opening up, I can tell you that you won't find fresher fish than this place. Try it once, you'll see!"}
{"text":"1st Timer. This place opened in May, driven by a few times thinking I needed to check it out even though I had no clue what it is. A sushi bar? A fast food kind of thing? A wanna be Pew Wei (which I hate) or something else. Yup, something else. Sushi yes. Super fresh, served in a bowl, small medium or large. You pick the guts, over rice. The sauces are off the charts, they are all good. I tried the spicy tuna, Hawaiian tuna & yellowtail for my first visit. Whew! All three meats served in a bowl with rice, and whatever else you want. I recommend the cucumber salad, edamame, and avocado for starters. Any sauce will do depending on how spicy you like it. The staff here is very accommodating so ask to get some sauces on the side so you can try several.

The ONLY negative which I will not grade them down for is the fact that if your not a sushi fan, or your date is not, don't come. It's al sushi based. I make my thoughts known and highly recommended they have at least one chicken dish. We'll see.

Gotta say, the taste of the food was a joy, one of those times where food really makes you happy. The beer could be colder, and more of a selection.... but hey these guys have only been open 3 months! Highly recommend! Dutch~"}
{"text":"Love this place, food is fresh and restaurant is clean. The staff is always friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The salmon is my favorite and it's great for people that have celiac! Real crab meat not IMITATION! So good and I have had plenty of poke in my day! Hands down best in Arizona! Seriously no wonder why they have 5 yelp stars!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love everything about this place.  From the cleanliness of the restaurant, to the friendliness of the staff, to the quality of the food, it ALL is top notch. I drove from Central Phoenix to check this place out and am so glad I did. There are places close to me but personally, I choose quality over location any day of the week and this place has it."}
{"text":"Me and my bf came in there. We heard about it from a ton of people. We are huge fans of ahi Poke Bowl and AJ's poke bar. When we got there it was really busy but the employees were making sure to let us know that they will be right with us. It's funny because me and my bf thought that these 4 boys were the owners because they seem so upbeat  &  caring. The poke was amazing. Only thing I recommend is brighter lights and instead of using the ice cream scooper to scoop the fish and pressing it up against the bowl to smoosh it , I would recommend getting a regular scooper so that way the fish stays firm and doesn't look like the left over fish has extra water in the bottom of the bowl for the next Customer. We will be coming here from now on due to the environment and the delicious Poke."}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Everyone was so friendly and the food was great. Love that they get all their fish from the pacific and it's delivered to them within 72 hours of being caught. Also, all the soy sauce they use is gluten free. I had a 2 scoop poke bowl with spicy tuna and all the toppings. Yum!"}
{"text":"Really good and really fresh, and the staff is helpful and provides great guidance for your selections."}
{"text":"Really nice restaurant- friendly servers. The poke is excellent . Live the sauces and combos. My fave was the salmon w/ traditional sauce- with a kick"}
{"text":"Absolutely FRESH and amazing food and friendly service! This place is by far the best poke spot in North Scottsdale conveniently located off the 101 and Pima. Too many great things to list and the ingredient combos are perfect.. check it out and you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. The place has a simple menu. I love the lobster even though it cost $4 more it was worth it! I was in and out in 20 minutes tops. Thank you guys we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service and surprisingly good food quality as well. Happy it's in my hood! Highly recommend this place if you're craving something healthy, delicious and different from the norm. There are only a handful of places in Scottsdale and Phoenix where I would eat poke or sashimi style fish. This is one of them."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Expensive!  My husband and son love poke so when we saw Koi we had to stop for lunch.  I was surprised by the price.  We spent $15 per bowl but the quality of the seafood was worth it.  They have a selection of different sauces to put on your bowl which you build with rice or mixed greens.  We did both and both tasted delicious."}
{"text":"I finally gave Koi Poke a second chance and I'm so glad that I did. Not only were the sushi scoops generous but the bowl was delicious! My favorite thing is that they have more veggie type options to go on the bowl. All the crunch made the bowl especially delicious and not heavy feeling. I'm so glad to add Koi Poke to one of my go to spots!"}
{"text":"I love Koi Poke Bar. Their seafood and all the extra are consistently fresh and there are so many toppings from which to choose. I feel satisfied with the portion and even with a small it is a generous meal."}
{"text":"This place is 2 for 2 for excellence. I would recommend the Hawaiian tuna in their house sauce"}
{"text":"Love this poke spot! I try to come once a week. All the poki is super fresh and that gives you a lot for your money. It super fast service and a very clean place."}
{"text":"Quality of food and service was great. Too pricey for me. $10 for a really small bowl..."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Staff is the friendliest around. I have eaten here almost everyday since they opened. The fish is so fresh and such great quality!! I love they have so many options and affordable!!! I'm telling everyone about this place. 

This is a must go to spot!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after work craving some sushi. They don't serve sushi, but what they do serve is amazingly fresh seafood poke bowls. I haven't had any seafood this good and fresh since moving to Scottsdale from Seattle. I'm a new fan!! Do yourself a favor and check this place out."}
{"text":"After reading the good reviews of Koi here on Yelp, I decided to go a bit out of my way and visit for lunch. As a native Seattle girl, I'm always a bit gun-shy of sushi and fresh fish in general in Arizona (don't be mad!!). For a quick, informal poke bowl lunch, Koi was one of the best I've tried - anywhere. The fish was super fresh, a good basic selection, together with tasty sauces and toppings. The servings - scoops - were actually larger than I was expecting, so it was overall a good value. Clean space and nice, helpful staff made it quick, easy, and delicious. When I'm in the area, I will return for sure."}
{"text":"This place is very good.  Been here a few times for a quick lunch or dinner.  Every time I've had a very good experience.  The fish is high quality.  The sides are fresh and the service friendly.  What's more... the place is clean as a whistle... something I highly value.  I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"This place is BY FAR the best poke spot in existence!!! My tastebuds are still celebrating the feast of happiness that I just devoured. Glorious Awesomeness!!! My family lived in Japan for a while and we got use to the abundance of fantastic sushi places, since moving to AZ it's been hard to find quality sushi grade fish, this place just won my heart!! As good as anywhere I've ever been on earth can't wait to go back for more!! Oh and they also have shaved ice!!! I wish I could give this place more stars!"}
{"text":"CraZy fresh! Best poke bowl I've ever had. My taste buds are still dancing. I have a poke spot right next to my house and would drive to this one instead."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood! The food is great. Appeals to everyone in the family, even if they have different tastes. Service was impeccable. All of the staff was friendly and knowledgeable. They offer lots of suggestions and tastes and are helpful and totally aware of dietary issues and modifications"}
{"text":"Nowhere on menu or website does it talk about sustainably caught or responsibly harvested fish. All comes packed from a Japanese supplier. More transparency please."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Yum. Yum. Yum. I can't saw how much we love this place!!! It's always yummy, with super friendly service."}
{"text":"Koi Poke Bar and Bowl is one of the places that does everything  very well. The staff is super welcoming, friendly and helpful. The presentation of the actual poke fish and other ingredients is very pleasing to the eyes and last but not least, the decor is simple and pleasant. 

I chose a medium bowl with a base of brown rice, topped with three scoops of various fresh fish which included Hawaiian tuna, yellowtail, and spicy tuna. I then chose the house sauce and sesame oil to go with the yellow tail and salmon, topped with the final ingredients of my choice which were edaname, cucumber, red onion and fish roe.

I thought the combination of flavors were outstanding, and the fish tasted very fresh although not as cool that I would have expected and would have enjoyed even more so if it had been cooler.

Overall a very good experience and I am very likely to return. The prices are in line with the high quality of the ingredients. My bill was $ 15.50 for a medium bowl with regular soda and I was very satisfied with the quantity of the food given."}
{"text":"Good clean seafood with reliable and consistent quality and over the top friendly experienced staff."}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi guy so this is based on their shrimp bowl. The toppings are fresh, the staff is friendly and they have good sauces. Prices are fair. The only thing that I would complain about is their shaved ice (aka sno) dessert - I'm used to eating shaved ice that is flavorful, but unfortunately this was not. It tasted more like ice with a hint of flavor. Other than that I would say this place is good and very filling even with the veggie and shrimp bowl I get."}
{"text":"I loved watching Koi Poke come to life.  The decor, the staff.  And then they opened!  Wow - the food is wonderful, the portions are filling and taste is beyond words.  I lived in Hawaii for a couple of years and this brought the islands here a bit.  Here's what you get in a medium - a healthy portion of brown rice, 3 scoops of protein (I had scoop of ahi, 2 scoops of marinated hawaiian tuna, spicy shoyu sauce, cucumber, edamame, masago, wasabi, and on and on.  I added avocado for $2 extra.  I was stuffed.  The bar opened this past week and so we made a date night out of it!  Koi Poke is still finding its true identity since it is sparkling new but before you get there you need a great brand, friendly staff, and wonderful food and Koi Poke has all of these!"}
{"text":"Wow - this poke is great! Love the way all the ingredients are arranged to make it easy to figure out what you want to put in your bowl. Easily up there for some of the best Poke I've ever had."}
{"text":"It's was my first time at Koi Poke Bar and Bowl, and I think my first time having Poke, and oh my gosh soooooo good. The food was delicious, the bar was amazing and the people were so nice and friendly. This is a must do!"}
{"text":"Went in today with a group of friends who love eating poke bowls just as much as I do.  Wanted to give this a try since its closer than the other poke bowl places.  The exterior and interior is nice and clean.  Just like the other poke bowl places, the concept is the same.  Order your base, your proteins and add-ons.  I'll agree with some of the previous reviews about the rice.  Its not your typical sushi rice.  The rice was steaming hot and countered the coldness of my fish and add-ons which I did not find appetizing.  The fish got warm.  I had 2 scoops of Hawaiian tuna and 1 scoop of salmon.  The salmon seemed fresh, but some of the Hawaiian tuna was mushy.  I had them put on the shoyu sauce which didn't really give it any taste.  Being from hawaii, when I think of shoyu, I think \"aloha\" brand shoyu...not soy sauce like kikkoman.  I don't usually go for a lot of add-ons.  I stick with seaweed and crab.  Those were ok.  The price, as already noted is a bit higher than the other poke places ($2 higher for my medium).  I'm ok with the plastic bowls the food is in.  I just don't get the metal trays though...really not needed.  I'll probably stick to poke bar and ahi poke bowl for now until I can find something more authentic like I'm used to in hawaii."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Best poke place in the valley.  Staff is overly friendly and the choices go on and on! I went to a poke place in Scottsdale ranch near my house and it didn't even compare. There are lots of gluten free options for sauces which I really appreciated."}
{"text":"The quality of the ingredients really set this Poké place apart from all the others I've frequented. They are apparently opening new locations soon. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Man... wow! Holy crap this place is good!

I have become addicted to Poke, like, it's bad; I need to see a specialist or something. 

This place is amazing! Super friendly staff, the menu is off the charts good! I have brought many people from work here that have never had Poke and they leave happy and customers for life. 

What you get for your money is beyond a good deal. I get the 4 scoops and I am stuffed and happy, but I don't feel tired or sluggish after. The food is healthy and packed full of nutrients. It's all so fresh and tasty. 

If you love seafood and/or sushi, you will love the Poke at Koi Poke. It's a no-brainer. 

Thanks for opening my palate to a completely new world filled with amazing flavors. Keep kickin butt and offering such great service and value and I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful and modern inside. Very impressive and clean. Very friendly staff! Go in and see Taylor, she's cute, knowledgeable, and has a great attitude! Excellent customer service! Must-try the shrimp with the champagne butter! Yes champagne butter! And their Hawaiian poke spot on! Totally worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Poke.   Great Service and so many options.   Ive been there at least once a week since they opened.    Dining in or quick take out is equally great.   Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Very nice and helpful staff, and good poke. My one big challenge with the spot was that if I'm paying $15+ for a fish lunch I don't want to eat it with a plastic fork .  Would be great if they added some actual silverware as an option. But for sure give it a try for a nice, fresh alternative to typical lunch fare."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and helpful.  The tuna was delicious and the accompaniments were all fresh and tasty as well.  The only improvement I hope for is in the bar area, i think the bartender could use a bit more training on what the bar has to offer.  I'll be back regardless!"}
{"text":"Great new spot hitting the nail on the head with the poke trend. 
What puts this place above the rest is they serve beer wine and sake! 
Thru August they have some amazing summer specials on booze too. 
Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I want to be successful, but I don't want to be so overly successful that I can't sneak in for a quick poke or hawaiian ice bowl without there being a line out the door. Everything I have tried has been perfectly fresh, quickly and carefully prepared, and created with friendly smiles and neighborly chit chat. I love the options for both fish and toppings. The REAL CRAB salad is sooo good. I'm dreaming about the seaweed salad, the different sauce options, the endless possible combinations all over again just writing this...must be time for another poke bowl!"}
{"text":"What a great concept!!  Read about this place in Phoenix Magazine. It's like going to a yogurt bar, but instead of yogurt and toppings, it is fish, sauce and toppings.  Fish was very fresh.  You choose a base (rice or greens), then a protein, toppings, and sauce.  Definitely a place I would return to and recommend."}
{"text":"Another awesome spot for poke. Their ingredients are fresh and they give general portions of each toppings. The restaurant is very clean and staff very friendly. The dining room is very large, much more spacious than the competitors. One other difference I noticed is that they offer yellowtail as one of their protein choice which I haven't seen anywhere else. However, the prices are slightly higher here. I'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! I am not from Scottsdale but I have eaten here twice in 3 days and both time it was excellent. It is very good value also. The staff are also very friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow. !  What a great place .  The neatest concept to eat healthy fresh sushi the way you like it, and without the wait !   This is first class food and service all the way.   A very clean environment with fresh ingredients.  I'll be back !!!!!!  Love this place"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying any poke and I'm so glad I went to Koi! The fish was so fresh and the variety of sauces were great. I was offered samples of all the sauces so I tried the house sauce and it was super unique and flavorful. I will definitely be back! New favorite place!"}
{"text":"Fresh & delicious!  Yummy sauces. Really impressed with the staff too. Don't change a thing!!"}
{"text":"This place is a refreshing change for the area. Both times I have walked in I was greeted immediately.  The service is very friendly and helpful. Maybe one of the friendliest places around. They have quite a few options for the bowls so you can have a different experience each time you come in.  The food is fresh and delicious. Pay the extra $2 and go for the avocado- it is worth it. My only teeny tiny complaint is the noise level. Because it is concrete it is hard to hear the person behind the counter. They can likely add some things to absorb the noise. Overall this is a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"A MUST!  As the other reviews say...everything fresh. Very pleasant environment. While they are opening other locations, this is the only with a full bar. I love that you get to essentially make your dish custom to order. Think Subway only high class freshest possible poke. Go!"}
{"text":"Didn't get a chance to try to poke bowls but had the Hawaiian ice! The coconut flavor shaved ice is FABULOUS! Can't wait to try the food this week! The bar looks so fresh!"}
