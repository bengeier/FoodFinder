{"text":"I had a fish sandwich and the fish was so old it could have voted... Yuck ... Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Really like the wings. They usually have specials on Tue and Thursday for them too."}
{"text":"A mixed bag for me at the Hofbrau. The wings are very good; perfectly cooked and nice and crunchy on the outside. We ordered the mild, which is a relative thing where wings are concerned...these were plenty spicy. The fried fish sandwich was just OK. I liked the batter they use, but the fish was overdone. I also think it's high time they change the oil in the fryer...I can tell when oil has broken down, and there's was past that point. With such a brief menu and so much of it consisting of fried food, it's imperative to stay on top of that, so they lost a star from me today. Go for the sports bar atmosphere and the wings."}
{"text":"Best damn wings around! My fav are the lemon pepper. Every Tuesday and Thursday is wing night. Great fresh cut fries too!"}
{"text":"Dive bar with amazing wings! They also offer pizza by the slice which is great too! Can't say I've tried anything else on the menu, but if the rest of their food is as good as their wings, then you can't lose."}
{"text":"The BEST WINGS in PITTSBURGH are in Canonsburg. I've spent many a Tuesday and Thursday eating these spectacular wings. No matter where I've lived around the burgh, it's been worth the trip. They also have a H-U-G-E fish sandwich. The Hofbrau is a great neighborhood bar, where more than likely you will know someone. It's family owned and they make you feel like family. There's 2 pool tables and the typical SWPA jukebox."}
{"text":"I had the pepper steak and it was absolute amazing.   Great bun. Excellently seasoned.   I'd have that 10 times over!   Try it and enjoy!"}
