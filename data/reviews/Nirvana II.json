{"text":"So happy I found this place.  Great portions at a great value.  Really friendly staff.  I often have half left over, which makes for a great lunch the next day for me or my husband.

They have punch cards too!

There's no place to sit here, FYI.  You have to take your food to-go.  But it's perfect for the downtown worker."}
{"text":"The first time I heard about Nirvana 2 was from a colleague of mine who loves Indian cuisine. Now growing up in a family of Indian chefs and doing my own Indian cooking there was only one restaurant that I like to visit and that was the Rajbhoj in the university area. When  I first went to check out Nirvana 2 I was pleasantly surprised to see that the owner was also a chef at Lolas making the lolas beef tips. If anyone has ever tasted the Lolas beef tips it is also close as you get to original Portuguese cuisine.

Now about Nirvana 2;- it is more about carrying out than dining in. Once you set that expectation you would be fine. Another thing to keep in mind is that not all Indian food is spicy. Anything that involves cream will be bland for the most part. What the reader Avi A said about the food being bland;- any lentils or korma will always have some blandness associated for it. If you want something with a flavor and a kick here are some options;-

Chilli chicken
Pepper Chicken
Any south Indian chicken
Curry fish - Yes this is really good

For you non vegetarians;-

Chama masalla
Any peas and mushroom combinations
Any kadai combinations

The coconut chicken is also good but dont expect it to be spicy.

The staff is very friendly and they do take feedback. So if you have to say something tell them. It will only help improve their cusine. My mama always told me that if you dont have something nie to say dont say it all. And if someone doesnt like the food they can always cook at home =(^-^)=!"}
{"text":"Quick place for a quick Indian Lunch. Chai was good too."}
{"text":"I did not like the food. I see a lot of oil in curries. I don't recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Nirvana II is the perfect place for a quick lunch uptown. The portions are always generous and priced reasonably. The food is good, could use a touch more heat but they give you spice containers to add if you ask. No seating inside, but a great option to take and eat on a nice table out and about somewhere."}
{"text":"new management, and new food.  I can deal with a learning staff.  This was nothing like the old nirvava 2 food.  Chili chicken bland and saag paneer looked just weird.  They dont make yogurt chicken anymore.  Also went up on prices.  1* and no more visits until old food is back.  I have talked with numerous regulars that wont be returning as well after similar experiences."}
{"text":"\"Nirvana\" understates the case. The food is heavenly, and an outstanding value considering the fantastic flavors, variety and ample quantity. The curries are each uniquely flavored and they don't taste too salty. The staff is friendly and the customers lined up waiting to be served always seem to be in a pleasant mood for some reason. (Nirvana II is take-out only.)

I've been eating Indian food regularly since the first Indira Gandhi administration. I've gotten to be a pretty good Indian chef myself -- like when I boil a pouch of Haldiram's yellow dal for 5 minutes and pour the contents over made-from-scratch basmati rice. But when I want to raise the bar a few notches, I head over to Nirvana II."}
{"text":"This used to be the place to get Indian food Uptown.  However, since new owners took it over, the food quality has greatly diminished.  You can tell because the line at lunch time would be out the door... now you are the only one in this place.  Was a 5 star, now a 1 star."}
{"text":"The restaurant is only open during lunch. I believe the hand-written sign said it was open between 11:00 and 2:15 but I would think that is subject to change. Strange hours, but great food. You can get 1 to 3 moderately priced entrees with rice and naan. The food is enough to fill you for half a day and it is fairly tasty with the right amount of spice. The staff is extremely friendly and the line is relatively long compared to other lunch places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The best way to describe the food at Nirvana II is that it tastes like disappointment.

Located in the bottom of 3 Wells Fargo, there's a line out the door to this carry-out only restaurant most days. I love Indian food, so I've attempted lunch from this location twice. The second time was only after I suitably convinced myself the first meal wasn't as big of a disaster as I remembered. I was wrong.

They don't serve authentic naan, you just get flimsy pita bread wedges. Their version of Chicken Tikka Masala is a gritty, brownish curry mixture that doesn't resemble a quality version of the dish in any way. The chicken may have bones, or it may not, it's really a surprise by the day.

I've tried another dish -  chana masala from here, and it tasted the same. (Fortunately no bones!) Flavors are just muddy.

Both times I've eaten here, I've tossed my lunch out half-eaten before finishing it. I don't understand why this restaurant is popular. How hard can it be to do Indian carryout right?"}
{"text":"I'm no expert on Indian, but I can say this is definitely my one and only stop for Indian during a work day in Uptown.  You get a ton of food and everyone inside is pleasant.  Line can look long and intimidating at times, but it goes relatively quick so give it a shot."}
{"text":"i had been dying for an indian joint in uptown across the street from me where the prices and food was good. yea a pipe dream up until now. basmati rice, nice and flavorful and so far the entrees were great.

chicken tikka- the base was very tastey and flavorful. the chicken was dry but thats ok im happy there is chicken tikka in my mouth

kadahi chicken- not too heavy which is a first but still good. chicken was juicy and thick enough base where it stuck to the rice and chicken

aloo gobi- which is a potato, cauliflower spice dish was very tastey and flavorful. a bit spicey for me cuz im weak sauzze but i didnt care. 

what i noticed about this place is that their food was not heavy...usually when i have indian its like im prego and can skip a meal or two afterwards. prices are great 5.99 for 1 meat entree or 1 veggie entree for 4.99...i will be back to lick the pans they said i can if i wanted to."}
{"text":"For what it was, it was good. Nice flavors, quick and easy. It was also fresh, which is more than I can say for its Uptown competitors."}
{"text":"I love indian food and this is gooood indian food. Love that you dont have to go to a formal restaurant to get it."}
{"text":"I was in and out of the restaurant pretty quickly (they have meals prepared and you just check out what you want). Since it was my first time there I had a few questions about the dishes, but the employees were helpful in explaining the contents of them. The food was great and they do give you a lot!"}
{"text":"Nirvana is a solid lunch option for the working stiffs uptown.  I eat here 2-3 times a month and it helps get me through the morning grind when I know I'm heading here for lunch.  It's pretty much a \"to-go\" type of establishment, but they do have a few tables out front.  I usually try to eat this stuff outside as the aroma is way too strong for the office.  I don't want to make my co-workers too jealous!

I usually stick to the vegetarian options (it's cheaper and you can get a lot more food for the price), but everything I've had has been delicious.  Indian food just has that 'POP', and Nirvana delivers it at a good value.  Yes, the naan is just pita bread as others have mentioned, but it's still good.  Make sure you also know your limit when it comes to spicy food because they usually have 1-2 entrees that deliver a big kick.  They'll let you know if you ask.

Bottom line, it's a tasty, cheap, and quick lunch Uptown.  I just have to watch it because sometimes I want to curl up under my desk and take a nap after chowing down!"}
{"text":"Really good Indian food. Horrible location unless you work or live uptown. I wish they would extend their hours too. It's a pain to find and pay for parking,  but the food is really good and sometimes worth it."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the newest addition to the Indian scene uptown,  mainly because the food lacks flavor which is just not a good look.  The servers were very friendly and allow you to sample what they have before you order.  I sampled a few items that were just ok, so I decided to stick with the tikki masala since this was my first visit.  Perhaps it was me but as I stated before the food simply lacked flavor and how shameful is it to serve store bought naan?"}
{"text":"I am not sure what happened to this place.  Based on other reviews I guess the change is due to new management - but the food I just had there was not the food I have been enjoying for the last couple of years... the second you walk in you can even smell the difference - the spice smells don't entice you like they used to.  The food is completely bland, the tikka masala is a weird dark brown color versus the delicious tomato sauce color that I had come to expect from this place, it tasted canned, the potatoes in the potato and okra curry tasted frozen - not fresh at all... overall, just SO disappointing.  

I used to go to this restaurant at least once a week... now I don't know if I will ever be back.  Tears have been shed over this... and based on the fact that I used to have to wait 10 minutes to order at this place and this time I just walked right up to the counter - it is pretty clear that I am not the only uptown worker who shares this disappointment.

BRING THE OLD FOOD BACK PLEASE!!"}
{"text":"I guess today it's their first new ownership crew, they seem a little confused and unorganized. I had the spicy chicken and tiki masala.  Great food, right amount of spice and not overwhelming. 
However the naan was pretty flat and not hot enough. It's been a while since I had Indian food ,but their yogurt sauce was too watery for me. I think it's supposed to be thicker like tzatziki sauce."}
{"text":"About a week ago I ate at this place with a buddy of mine. I got the chicken biryani, coconut chicken and tikka masala with naan. Like one of the reviewers said earlier; the naan is not authentic. The coconut chicken was something that I had never tried before and I think since I was starving before coming here, it tasted really good. Biryani was like any other you'd find in Charlotte.

Do not expect great customer service. My Moroccan friend wanted to know what raita was made up of and asked the cashier what it was and what's in it. Without even looking at him the cashier just picks up a little tin of raita and put it in the bag, assuming he wanted it."}
{"text":"BEST INDIAN IN CHARLOTTE! Convenient, fast, delicious and affordable!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for lunch time -- the price is definitely right (like $8 for one meat, rice and naan). I just never feel super great after eating it. The foods pretty greasy, even for Indian food, and the cafeteria style presentation isn't them doing any favors. Sometimes it's been really good though, so I think time has a lot to do with it. Try going closer to when they open -- especially if you want a non gravy item like Chicken 65, or else it'll be too soggy. 

They also serve chai tea later in the afternoon (cash only if recall correctly)."}
{"text":"The food was average at the cost i got. Not bad for a regular goer. Decent service and very quick, i came out in 2 minutes. Options are not too much, but for an Indian food lover, it will be enough."}
{"text":"Sigh...I used to eat here 3 times a week. It is no longer great food; it's not even good anymore. The flavors are different. The food doesn't seem freshly cooked, just reheated. The food is more grey/brown in color.  I'm not sure if it went downhill do to the Persis competition a block over from here or if it's new management. They don't even bother to give you diced onions anymore; they are just huge wedges now. I'd pass on the naan. The other reviewer also mentioned the sweet korma. It's quite off putting. The mango lassi is bright orange, clearly not fresh and the samosa was so unappealing as to be inedible. RIP."}
{"text":"This place is always packed at lunch! The menu is minimalistic, allowing you to spend less time thinking about what food to order and more time eating! I ordered the chicken tikka masala and one samosa, Both were scrumptious and relatively inexpensive. Service was quick and friendly, I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Money in the bank for takeout-only Indian lunch. The food is delicious, and the service is quick. Try this place out if you don't have many afternoon meetings (because you'll eat yourself sleepy)."}
{"text":"In short, the food is unspectacular but they give you a ton of it. I wish they had some more spice in their food, but they do have some sauces you can grab at the end - the green one (mint chutney?) is good"}
{"text":"Was my second time there. No A/C this time and the beverage cooler was broken. Felt like I was really in India!  Good was fair but they seem to pile on the rice and skimp on the chicken. Maybe just a bad day for them. Will go back but seriously hope they get back to Nirvana standards."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place appears to have changed owners. Food's slightly different, perhaps a bit worse than before. Prices have gone up. Still your best choice to get an Indian fix uptown for lunch, but not much competition."}
{"text":"Good design for workday lunch - in and out in a few minutes. Food is okay.

No place to sit inside. Don't take American Express. Menu online is not 100% accurate to what they serve (maybe they rotate dishes)."}
{"text":"This take-out Indian place has become one of my go-to lunch spots. It's fast enough that I can easily grab lunch and either eat it outside or at my desk without it becoming lunch hour-and-a-half. 

The menu rotates, but it seems that chicken tikka masala is always available for those who are spice averse. Today, they had fish curry, aloo channa, dal tarka, chicken biryani, malai veggies,and coconut chicken. If they have rice pilaf available that day instead of just rice, pay the extra quarter and get it. If you are unsure whether you will like a dish, ask for a taste before you order it. They are happy to accommodate. 

Chai is sporadically available and my coworkers swear by it, though I find it too sweet. Occasionally, they will have a dessert available - get it! I have seen some seemingly strange combinations of foods in their desserts that I thought would absolutely not work flavor-wise and they turned out to be surprisingly delicious!"}
{"text":"The service was prompt and the food was tasty. It was my first time ever eating Indian food so I can't say I knew what to expect. I will certainly eat here again if the opportunity presents itself. 

I went in July 2013. Amex was not accepted at that time. Perhaps things have changed?"}
{"text":"YUM!  I was here for the first time yesterday.  It is located at the Wells Fargo 3 building right on 2nd street next to the former Ono's.  

They cleaned up the place a bit - the former tenant of this location was famous for his unhygienic ways and sour attitude.  The FIRST thing I asked upon entering was if the new owner was affiliated with the previous one and the nice man said no!  Phew!!

This is a takeout Indian spot - they have several different dishes to choose from (I think they are only open for lunch?  I am not sure....).  

I had the Chicken Tikka Masala yesterday and it was mild - perfect for this inexperienced Indian-Food-Loving palette.  The beautiful rice was plentiful and the nice chef also gave us free tastes of anything we wanted to try.  

The nan was the only letdown.  It seemed prepackaged, as in not freshly made.  But the rest of the food and yogurt sauce was delicious.  I got my food plus a bottle of water for $7 bucks.

Can't wait to get back here!  So glad it is convenient for us uptown workers!!!  :-D"}
{"text":"I have been on quite the Indian binge lately, making it myself at home, trying everything pre packaged from Trader Joes and then a Groupon came out for Nirvana II. I only bought two meals worth knowing I should have purchased more and I really should have. 

I never go Uptown so my first trip to Nirvana was anything but \"Nirvana\". I wasted most my lunch break roaming around uptown, now on foot looking for the restaurant. It is neatly tucked away in some building on MLK blvd, not really S Tryon, which is probably what caused all my confusion. 

But alas I made it! For my first trip I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala with a side of curried potatoes and eggplant. The Chicken was awesome, the tikka masala was very mild which was nice since the potatoes and egg plant was quite spicy. 

I went again today ordering the Chicken Tikka Masala again, the chili chicken or pepper chicken looked great but my stomach has been sensitive to spicy lately, hope that passes.The sides were Aloo Bhindi (potato/okra), Navratan Korma and I got a mango lassi. This all came out to ten dollars, I swear it was pushing five pounds of food. I should have weighed it once I got back to the office. The chicken once again was great, korma was mildly spiced and the pineapple really made it stand out. But the aloo bhindi is what I was excited about the most. I had no idea Okra was a big deal out of the south east, probably because my mid western GF had never heard of it. It was very good, almost tasted like the same spices from the eggplant/potato curry but not as spicy.

For someone who has recently discovered a love for Indian food and by recently I mean six months, I enjoyed Nirvana II. Sure it's the first Indian restaurant I have ever dined at (Woodlands I am looking at you next) but I think eight dollars, ten with the Mango Lassi for more food than I can eat in one sitting is a great deal. I will definitely return with or without a Groupon."}
{"text":"I'm gonna go ahead and disagree with the prior review on this one.

I was initially excited to hear about the opening of this new Indian Fusion restaurant as it's right next to where I work and I love South Asian food. The concept was new, interesting, and unique. The prices were incredibly low and the pictures on the outside looked pretty good. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed when a bunch of buddies and I went to finally try it out (we all happen to be brown by the way). 

I can appreciate the fact that the food isn't supposed to taste exactly like Indian cuisine as it has culinary influence from several different areas of the world. But what I personally found was that the flavors and textures of the dishes they offered were as uninviting and bland as the yellow interiors of the actual establishment. We tried the red beans, the chicken korma, a couple of wraps, eggplant, and another chicken dish and somehow I couldn't even finish my food. Maybe it's just my bias since I grew up with this type of cuisine, but I'm not gonna pretend that I would even consider coming here again.

To put it briefly, you get exactly what you pay for. For $5 at lunch time, you're going to get $2 quality chicken, $1 quality rice, $2 quality taste. It's like waiting in line at the school cafeteria. In the back of your mind, you're hoping for something good today, but ultimately you end up wishing you hadn't even made the effort to get in line.

You can tell that some of the flavors are there in terms of identifying it as coming from a certain part of Asia, but you won't find the boldness or adequate seasoning in any of the dishes. The wraps were of course leaking everywhere because they put the actual chicken IN it's gravy into the tortilla. Not a clever move.

I was also charged $76 because she \"pressed the numbers too quickly.\" Hopefully the void shows up in my statements, otherwise I had an unbearably overpriced lunch....

I suppose if you've never had Indian food in your life, this might pass as edible.

2/5"}
{"text":"I'm a newly acquired regular at this take-away Indian joint. It's delicious food with a rotating menu and ginormous portions for a meager 7 bucks. Add a veggie samosa for 75 cents, don't miss the bone-in chicken spinach dish they have on Tuesdays and grab a lunch card if you go often... after 9 visits your 10th is free!"}
{"text":"I have visited this place at least twice a week since I started working in downtown Charlotte. 

The spicy dishes are legitimately spicy and wonderful, but there is plenty to choose from if you want to stray away from the spice. 
Their naan isn't the best, but the rest of the food more than makes up for it. Even when the line is out the door during lunch, it moves quickly and the staff is amazingly friendly. Two vegetarian dishes with rice and naan are enough to have me near stuffed for less than $8. 

I only wish they took AMEX. Other than that, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Good Indian food for a good price. Liked it! Simple concept - pick and go.  Dine in option not available."}
{"text":"Variety is the spice of life, and is this spice of life that is missing from Nirvana II.  There are plenty of delicious spices in the food, but I went here for lunch and there were two vegetarian choices (paneer chunks or chana) and three meat choices (not three choices of meat, all the meats were chicken, but three choices of sauce for meat).  I don't consider the biryani as a separate choice, because flavor wise you are getting biryani or rice.

The value is similar to other places in the area, your Mexican or American places have a similar amount of food.  I was a bit over stuffed from getting the 3 entree option - I recommend the 2 entree option as being the right amount of food.

I enjoyed the flavors of the food but without being cheaper or having more variety they aren't going to break into the upper stratosphere of stars.  I also thought the raita (yogurt) was a bit bland plus even asking for two containers I hardly got enough.  The naan isn't worth the trouble.  It lacks that light fluffiness and felt like it had been stacked under something heavy and absorbed extra moisture.

They have the cooking skills, but they didn't make four star choices with the menu.  They are another reasonably fast buffet that you can only carry out and they pack the container for you (they are generous enough).

Conclusion: if you are nearby then go here, but don't travel out of your way.  Find your local supplier.  For me that is a place down the street from my home (see my other reviews and you will find it)."}
{"text":"I'm a frequenter of Nirvana II for my lunches (perhaps once every other week).  The selling point here is the magnitude of the portions; if you get the combo they will seemingly give you enough food for a family of nine.  Service is always excellent, and you can be in-and-out in under three minutes on most days.  I generally will just point to whatever looks appealing among the eight-or-so dishes that are served daily, and have always been satisfied.  My only major complaint is the lack of spice in the food; my taste buds want to go on a rodeo, but sadly this is but a mere pony ride."}
{"text":"Maybe 5 stars is a bit of a exaggeration because it's not like their food is perfect, for instance the naan isn't particularly good but overall their food is great. Fast, affordable, a block from my office and with enough spice to actually taste interesting. 

The spice thing is a big peccadillo of mine because most of these lunch spots really turn down not just the heat but overall flavor to suit the typical business lunch crowd. Nirvana II don't compromise as nearly as much and their food is adequately flavorful. 

The menu also rotates regularly so you never get too bored of what's available. Still i mostly go there on Fridays when they have their fish curry which i'm rather partial to."}
{"text":"Aromas were great. Staff was friendly. Food was tasty and plentiful. However, the 2 chicken dishes I had were too bland - not spicy at all. I mean zero. \"Indian food\" and \"spicy\" go hand in hand, and it doesn't have to be overpowering; even very mild spice makes for more flavorful food.  Nirvana II could use a little of that. 

Take out only. A couple of cleanish tables outside the front door.

I will say most of the clientele was Indian, and they are likely better judges of the food than I."}
{"text":"Looks like a drab shady place to get food from, but the food is quite good. One of the few places I actually enjoyed Indian food at. They had a black bean curry on the menu and it was yummy yummy! Wish I had the appetite to try the biryani too coz it looked (and smelled ) great. I should also mention that this place gives you good value for money coz their portions are quite generous."}
{"text":"Friends took me for lunch last week. It is expensive for the portion and the food taste pretty bland.
Server kind of dirty too"}
{"text":"This place is busy like no other during lunch time! Decent Indian food in uptown, ESP on Thursdays for goat curry! It's a hit or miss though bc sometimes u get mostly bones. But the flavors are there!

The menu is confusing to read, I still don't know what the pricing is but I usually get biriyani (mixed rice dish) with a meat (either goat curry or chicken tikka masala) and a vegetarian side like paneer. This is actually more than enough food that you can split into two meals. Either that or just get the rice and meat dish for around $8. 

Make sure to get here before 1pm bc they run out of food quick. And it's all to go dishes, no dine in option!"}
{"text":"Uptown Indian selections are limited for me.  The place in Latta Arcade is meh. And I don't know where any other places are.  This little joint opened up right across from the entrance of my parking garage, and I had to try it out.  MmMMMMMmMMmmmm!  So great, super friendly staff, and hearty portions.  And they didn't give me beef (ha!) about not wanting rice with my combo.  Super tasty and flavorful food that doesn't taste like it had been sitting there for ages.  So glad to have another awesome option in uptown!  Yay!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite eateries however they change pricing without warning so I paid double what I normally pay and then when they gave me receipt it did not itemize what I was being charged for. Won't eat there again because I feel like I got scammed."}
{"text":"As the stars say...this is as good as it gets. The food is wonderful, the blend of flavors are beautifully done and if you haven't done so try some of the pastries in the case near the register."}
{"text":"About 6 months ago this place started to noticeably, but subtly, evolve.  Gone were the friendly owners, replaced by a new crop of much younger, less interested employees.  I can recall on not once, but at least 2 to 3 occassions going here shortly after 11am for an early lunch and the place was closed.  I've walked in at 11:30 am and they're still setting up? 

Prices went up, small changes to the menu items started showing up and the coma-inducing, extra scoops of food that really defined the value of their offering started to wane.  In other words, now you're getting too much food (instead of WAYYY too much food) for $9, instead of $8.  Subtle - but impactful to the discerning lunch goer.  

One correctable, subtle issue that popped up, and still persists today as I pull another one out of my mouth while chewing and writing this review, is exhibited by the fact that they cook with in-tact, full-sized Cardamom pods and cloves.  Now in and of itself, this is not at all an issue, and in fact encouraged as the subtle flavors are a terrific layer of flavor.  The problem exists when the pods and cloves are not removed prior to serving the dish and so you'll occassinally get a mouthfull of surprise when you bite into an entire Cardamom pod which can simply destroy your pallette for the next several minutes.  It's a rookie mistake, that can be easily changed and make a subtle improvement to their quality.  

Unfortunately, after some serious evaluation of this place for several weeks, if not months (yea I still come here pretty much weekly because it's the closest place to my office) I can no longer recommend this place to folks who may have an Indian food itch burning in their appetites.   The subtle changes that the Aroma management team has made have deteriorated the overall offering beyond my comfort zone.  In fact, the line out the door that used to exist for Nirvana II is gone - the people have spoken!!  

The other factor here is that Persis Biriyani opened up a place across the street in the Latta Arcade.  In another month or so, after they work out the kinks, I would expect Persis to crush this place on every facet of their offering.  DING DING DING - LETTTS GET READDDY TO RUMMMBBBLLLLEEEE!!!!!

And oh yea, the naan is still awful."}
{"text":"A new indian option uptown. The way I see it, anything's better than the place in the Latta Arcade. I welcome you with open arms. Cheap prices, friendly service with a smile and decent food. 

Minimalist interior, I mean seriously. No decor, it just a straight up take out restaurant. No decor = low overhead. Yay for me."}
{"text":"I'm pretty much a newbie when it comes to Indian food but I very much enjoyed the lunch I had this week. Wanted to try as much as I could at once so went with 3 meats. Chicken Tikka, Pepper Chicken and Chili Chicken. All meals come with basmati rice and naan, which here means warmed up pita I guess. 

Each dish had nice flavor and varying degrees of heat with the Tikka being the most tame, but also the most deeply flavored. 

The line was long but moved at a decent pace and the service was very friendly."}
