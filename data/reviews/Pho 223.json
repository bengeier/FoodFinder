{"text":"Had dinner here. There was a dead winged insect on the imperial roll. I eventually caught the attention of the server. She said \"want [a] change\"? New dish of food arrived from the kitchen. Food was all right. My partner ordered beef-- he says it was over-cookea. Poor customer service on their part-- most times a reataurant would at least give the meal for free. Was charged full price on our bill. Bug in food + bad customer service = not going back."}
{"text":"The best soup and spring roll in Montreal. Rated 4 stars because the wasrooms are disgusting."}
{"text":"Background: I visited Montreal for a week and really just needed something to eat that was close enough to my air BNB location upon arrival. This gem was it! 

Pros
1. Quick service
2. Affordable 
3. Friendly staff 
4. Yummmy 

Cons
1. Utensils did not look clean

Overall: The quality of food was great! I don't remember the name of the dish I ordered but it had chicken, shrimp, and onions on rice noodles. The food was well seasoned and came with a spring roll and salad, which were both amazing. I would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I know my Vietnamese food. So many other good restaurants, save your stomach for a better restaurant.

The front staff included a middle aged woman (looks like the mother) and a younger pretty girl (probably the daughter). The woman was not rude, but in no way friendly when she took our order. The girl was soft spoken and nice and had a friendly face. We ordered and waited for while. Finally our entrees came out, all 5 except 1. After 5 minutes, we reminded them, and they said it takes a bit longer for his meal, so another 5 minutes. OK, so we waited.. While waiting, here's my take on the other aspect of the restaurant: 

Ambiance: Neon signs, fake flowers, old dirty chairs and tables - basically, a typical run down Vietnamese restaurant. There were many tables here, and the restaurant can hold a lot of customers. When we came in for dinner, there were about 5 or 6 other groups in there.
Cleanliness: dirty and smelly
Staff: owner was not so friendly, the younger girl is nice
Price: seems lower cost than other places, but i'd rather pay $2 more for a better meal.

ALL of our entrees finally showed up. Thinking of the food we had makes me kind of mad right now.. but here is our food:

Com ga gung xa: this was good. chicken was soft. this was the only decent plate from our group.

Pho tai: lots of liquid and not much to actually eat. the broth itself was not good either. it's just weird, not the normal pho taste. My dad always orders Pho Tai everywhere he goes, and he couldn't even eat this. 

Pho ThaiLand style: this sucks. Basically the broth taste of bo kho. it has carrots and tomatoes, a bunch of vegies that you normally don't find in pho, and then they add a little spice in it, and call it pho ThaiLan. 

Bun Thit (heo) Nuong Cha Gio: Normal. Nothing special. Nothing good. Didn't finish my meal. they didn't' have peanuts, the shred lettuce they put in there was minimal. I don't remember having bean sprouts in it, which it should. There were no mints.

Bun Thit Bo Cha Gio: This was the entree that they had pictured on the table. 2 people saw this picture and ordered it. This was better than their disgusting soup dishes, but the worst of the dry dishes. The beef was dry, the cucumber was soggy and almost gone bad, tomatoes are overly ripe, basically.. I feel VERY bad for everyone at the table, especially my parents, who had Pho Tai and this Bun Thit Bo Cha Gio. 

Final Verdict: I wouldn't come back if you paid me."}
{"text":"Everyone has their special spot for this type of dish.  But work with me here:  Let's say you find yourself walking around a city labeled as the \"second largest in Canada\" and after around an hour you have passed about 20 closed (!) restaurants on a Saturday afternoon, and it's really cold out, your hunger will always outweigh your standard rational thinking.

Pho2000 is one of those places.  It was open! (+1), there were people eating in it (+1), the portions looked good (+1), the prices seemed reasonable.  So the restaurant itself is pretty dingy, and the staff is your classic Asian mom+pop who are a little grumpy, but i like that.  we tried the Imperial rolls, and i had the Spicy Thai Beef Pho.  The food didn't come out in 30 seconds, so they must have been prepping something, and when it did come out, it was super tasty, full of nice veggies and slices of beef which cooked some more in the broth, and was especially fiery with some added hot sauce.

Check it out once, at least."}
{"text":"The pho is really good here. The broth has those layers of richness and subtle flavors that make a great soup base. I have been several times and have tried all the various varieties. The satay beef (spicy) is my favorite. Imperial rolls were so-so. I haven't tried any of the other dishes, and really, why bother?

For the life of me, I don't know why they couldn't put a tiny bit more effort into cleaning and updating the interior. But, it doesn't bother me that the place feels like you are actually IN Vietnam. I think that is charming. Prices aren't bad. An extra large pho is about $10, and you will be stuffed if you can manage to finish all the broth. 

Montreal is cold in the winter time, and this pho hits the spot, leaving you warm and satiated for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Pho 2000 is on a not especially appealing block on St Catherine St.I liked it.We had dinner on a weekday after 8:30.It wasn't crowded.We both had Beef Pho .I went for the works - the tendon , stomach , gizzards - whatever.I followed it with a dish of chicken and noodles.Had a couple of Chinese beers.It was quick.It was close to the hotel and we were tired.The prices were sane and everything was flavorful and pleasing."}
{"text":"It's Pho-tastic and a good $9 deal on a freeezing cold day!"}
{"text":"What a gem!! Never knew this hole in thenwall mom and pop pho place made such good pho. 

Portions were plentiful...ordered a small but size did not fail. Beef was tender and had right amount of mest and fat ratio.

Best part...the broth! On a cold snowy day...this is exactly what the doctor ordered. So flavorful and tasty..not heavy on msg..( didnt feel thirsty after). 

Lots of onions and and cilantro....perfectly ending to a day of sightseeing in the cold. 

Husband and wife team were very attentive and quick on the service. Amazing pho in dt montreal!!

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"tried goi guon and phô today.
apparently all the prices and foods is more valuable in chinatown. i would say go to pho bang ny"}
{"text":"Pas super la place, plutôt sale même. La soupe tom yom épicée était trop salé mais vraiment trop, le général tao était pleins de morceaux d'os et de nerf de poulet??...si quelqu'un m'invite la bas gratuitement je dit non c'est sur."}
{"text":"Mediocre pho. Not much I can say - if you want viet food, this is an option."}
{"text":"Oh god, no more poutine.  I feel so heavy, but I'm really hungry.  Why is everything closed on Sunday?  WHY why?  It's s... s... so cold, can't feel my feet.  Oh!? It's open!  One large bowl with everything on it please.  (eating pause)  Let's go to the top of Mount Royal guys!

A bowl of pho can really lift your mood, even after pounding your body into submission with beer and poutine for three straight days.  It is right on par with almost every other pho restaurant I've been to.  This one just happened to be open on Sunday and in the direction we were walking.  For that, I am a fan."}
{"text":"I found out later that there are way better options just one block west of here.  had a raw beef soup and the beef was hard and chewy.  not fresh ingredients.  the place was empty and depressing."}
{"text":"Having been away for a month, I miss pho the most. However, my favourite one in Chinatown is closed for an unspecified period of time. So one day on the way home, I feel the need to quench my thirst for Pho. This one only disappointed me. 
There are plenty of choices on the menu. We only had two pho. I ordered Number 5, small for 6.99$, fair price. However, the soup was too salty. I can't drink much of the soup. Also other herbal flavour was covered by the salt. Such a shame. I think they probably can make a decent rice plate but the pho is the best way to tell its capabilities. 
Below average food aside, the staff wasn't friendly either. Won't come back."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food and I love pho soup. I was on a look out for a quick bite to eat when I've came across this place. The decor is very outdated inside, but overall looked clean. The service is just okay, polite but not overly friendly. My soup was not as I anticipated it to be, the broth just didn't taste as rich as I've tried in other places. However, my friend's soup (it wasn't not pho) was delicious. I may come here again but probably order something different on the menu."}
{"text":"One of the best spring rolls in Montreal!

This my go to place when I am craving two things: spring rolls (not the fried type) and soup. 

Every time I go I order the #2 Spring rolls with shrimp and the #5 spicy Thai soup. You get two freshly made spring rolls, along with an amazing peanut sauce. I usually add some spicy sauce to it and it makes for a perfect kick. I've been to many places around Montreal and I haven't found a place that makes better spring rolls.

For the soup again lots of fresh vegetables, noodles and a very tasty broth. I've had many different soups here, and they are all good. Unfortunately I have not tried much of the other food, mostly because the soup and springs rolls are that good.

If you are in the area and you are hungry, this is definitely the place. Don't worry about the looks of the place, you will get food that will make you want to come back again, and again!"}
{"text":"Il faisait vraiment, vraiment, vraiment froid (genre moins 30 avec le vent) et j'avais à la fois faim et besoin de me dégeler les bout des orteils et des doigts. En fait, j'étais en route pour prendre une bière au Sainte Élizabeth quand je suis passée devant ce restaurant avec une collègue de travail et on s'est dit que ça vaudrait la peine d'y arrêter pour se remplir l'estomac avant de boire! On a toutes les deux commandé des plats différents qui étaient parfaits pour nos besoins. Les portions sont très généreuses et la viande est bien cuite. Ça n'est rien de trop \"fancy\" mais quand je veux un bon bol de pho, c'est plutôt la simplicité que je recherche, donc cet endroit est parfait. Probablement pas le restaurant pho le mieux décoré ou bien rénové le plus récemment, mais quand la bouffe est bonne et pas chère, est-ce que ça dérange vraiment? Je ne pense pas. J'y retournerai définitivement si une envie de pho, ou le besoin de me réchauffer en plein hiver me prend!"}
{"text":"saw the pictures of their combo dishes posted by the window; attracted inside.

had the jazz 2 combo which includes a clear broth soup, grilled beef and shrimps on skewer over vermicelli, and a soda, at $11.99. bf had a seafood fried noodle ($9-10?) that didn't look half as good as mine. \"should have tried to pho (under $10) like everybody else\", he said. i agree.

service is good; waiter (boss?) was polite and pleasant. they have a bar w/a good amount of liquors on the shelves, but we didn't have any drink from it. as many asian eateries, they prefer cash. seems like they either have a surcharge for using credit card, or was it debit only? have to ask the person who took care of the bill to verify that."}
{"text":"My friend and I were walking on St. Catherine Street looking for a place to stop by for a bite before we head out to the club and we saw this place. The food pictured looked awesome and it was getting late, so we decided to just give it a try. OMG. I was sooo happy we came here! Their was a picture on the menu of a heaping plate of vermicelli, a huge portion of beef, a long piece of fried goodness (aka an imperial roll) and a skewer of grilled shrimp! And it also came with soup, salad, and tea (or soda) for only CAD$12!!! I knew I wouldn't be able to eat it all, but it just looked so good! The fatty in me totally took over and I ordered it. 

I can't even tell you how amazing it was. After one bite I went straight to fatty heaven. Everything was delicious and I would totally come back if I had more time to spend in Montreal!"}
