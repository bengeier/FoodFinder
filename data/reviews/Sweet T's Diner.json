{"text":"I wanted to like this place - really!  I sat at the counter so that I could get a look at all of the restaurant.  Boy did I get an eyeful and earful.  Besides the very slow service, the management of the restaurant is awful.  There is a person that stands with their back to the counter that coordinates the food as it comes up.  Between his stink eye looks around the restaurant, his berating the cooking staff, slamming dishes and throwing silverware, it was hard to enjoy my meal.  His actions were very disturbing.  They need someone who can \"manage\" people, not an ogre.  We had a nice waitress who apologized for the slow service and the food was ok.  I hope this makes it but with Cheese Mo's and Cosmos right there, it is not looking too good!"}
{"text":"I have only eaten here once and  need to go a couple more times to get a really good feel for the place.  For our first visit,  the food was good, but not outstanding. We went for brunch on a Saturday - it was sort of late for the breakfast crowd but too early for the lunch crowd, so there was no wait. My initial impression was that the place was rather empty and devoid of any warmth or authentic \"personality\".  It just seemed bare.  While we were eating, more patrons came in so it didn't seem quite as empty- but overall the place still lacked personality.  It almost has the feel of a chain restaurant... not a \"quaint\" little home-grown diner. Our waitress was very accomodating for special requests, which we always appreciate because we are picky eaters. I had the breakfast burrito which was good, but  just a little on the bland side.  I was happy that they give you the option to have Turkey Sausage instead of pork.  I got hash browns instead of grits and they were fine - again, nothing to get excited about but they were hot and fresh which is half the battle!  The coffee was a little weak for my tastes, but serviceable. The prices are very reasonable.  Overall, I would say this is a good place to go if you are looking for a decent meal at a decent price.  I'll definitely give it another try to see if it gets any more exciting."}
