{"text":"A slice of pizza and a soda cost $12!  Crust was hard, pizza was ok.  Reminded me of frozen Totinos pizza.  I would suggest trying Sirrocos on the first floor, closer to NY style pizza."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for YEARS and not once did I have horrible service like today BOTH employee named Megan and her supervisor had the worse attitude with myself and my friends when we asked the dark haired supervisor if they sold ranch she stated \"NO I don't sell ranch, BUT we have it\" nice customer service. Definitely looking for a new pizza place."}
{"text":"There is nothing special about this pizza place. I had ordered the garlic knots and a slice of cheese pizza. 

The garlic knots was very heavy and with little to no garlic flavor. They were heavily buttered in some spots but the garlic flavor was left to be desired.

The cheese pizza  was a greasy mess. There were puddles of grease on the slice of pizza. After soaking up all the extra grease with napkins, the cheese pizza was just a little plain.

If you just want something to fill you up then it's ok. If you want great pizza, skip this place."}
{"text":"We found NYP at about 2am after wandering around the Strip and finding ourselves inside New York, New York. The atmosphere around the restaurants in New York is charming and makes every dining experience that much more fun.

NYP had a great special when we stopped in: Any slice of pizza plus a cold draft of beer for just $7.77. Pizza was good, a little underdone and greasy but very tasty. The draft beer was Rolling Rock and was ice cold and delicious."}
{"text":"Very good pizza! Seriously this was one of my favorite stops while visiting New York New York Casino. Pizza was fresh, had crispy crust, loads of mozzarella cheese, and tasted perfect! Get the Caesar Salad: it comes with freshly grated Parmesan cheese....and they don't skimp on the cheese!! The price was incredibly reasonable especially for Las Vegas and they even accepted a competitor's coupon!"}
{"text":"Vegas has the best pie west of the Mississippi???    Who knew :)"}
{"text":"I ended up here purely by accident.  But luckily for me, it turned out much better than I was expecting.  I assumed that this would be like the other pizza place in NY-NY and overcharge for a mediocre slice.  Now, while it was more than I'd pay anywhere except the Strip (which everything on the Strip is) the pizza itself was surprisingly good.  

Also, totally get some of the garlic knots. They're only 99 cents a piece and they were great."}
{"text":"Had to try the pizza to see how close to real NY it is after our disappointing visit at Sirricos. This will be a must on every visit. Excellent flavor and hopefully will stay this way as long as health conscious do gooders don't ruin it looking for healthy  pizza as they have done at Sirricos forcing them to change to low and no fat cheese. Eat salad and not pizza if you want healthful pizza."}
{"text":"The staff is nice and the food is great for a quick bite to eat. It does have a bit of a new york pizzeria feel to it minus the dim lights and rats in the alley way. You can get a slice under $5. 

Overall good place to take a break from gambling or shopping."}
{"text":"Ordered a family size pepperoni pizza with dour guys. The crust was very soft and the cheese and pepperoni were fat. Wouldnt recommend it for good pizza, but ok for a midnight snack."}
{"text":"Recommended by HRH Staff and specifically Cab Driver to munch on some very good pizza. Slice is large per piece and flavor is phenomenal.  Visit late night when the buzz is killing you too bc it's delish! Staff is friendly and very attentive.  Kudos!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me - \"Best Pizza in Las Vegas...\" I was told.   So I stopped by around 11:30 at night cause I was HUN-GRY.  Making my way past the kid trying to convince me to go to Coyote Ugly I saw the pizza and it looked and smelled delicious.  Simple order of one slice of pepperoni and a garlic knot, plus a soft drink.  The person I was with ordered a piece of stuffed pizza, a salad, and a soft drink as well.  I can confirm the food is par-baked.  They grabbed it from the tray in the display and popped it in the oven.  Couldn't wait....

Well imagine my surprise when that par baked pizza came out of the oven.  The bottom was completely black (the same for the other slice) and the slice tasted like cardboard.  It wasn't the worst pizza I've had, but it certainly wasn't the best.  The knot was exactly as described.  A twisted piece of dough, with a buttery garlic coating.  In fact it tasted just like a knot!

So good job New York Pizzeria!  You've eliminated another restaurant for me to eat at in Las Vegas.  I appreciate it and will be happy to not recommend you to others as well."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza for the late night craving!! It was about 2am and we had just left O'sheas, went through New York New York as we were staying at Excalibur. We were starving and thought we would have to settle for McDonald's because of the time. Saw this place and they made us a fresh pizza to go. So good!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here twice and were quite satisfied. Tried pepperoni, cheese, and a cheese with white sauce. All were very good and by the slice. Service was fast and staff friendly. Nothing for us to complain about. Very good pizza but not quite 5 star."}
{"text":"I am very picky about New York style pizza & this was delicious! I had the spinach, mushroom, ricotta. The mushrooms melt in your mouth & it was just the right amount of ricotta. So yummy. I'm surprised they have 3.5 stars. They should definitely be 5 stars for the type of place it is. It's casual, order, pay & eat. But it's so bomb!"}
{"text":"I honestly can say that all the day crew cashiers  are rude ! this attitude girl Claribel pisses me off with her rude behavior!!! Something needs to be done . The food is really good by they way !:)"}
{"text":"This is not that good. The reviews seem all over the place but we tried it out anyway. The pizza was just ok. Definitely not worth the $7 a slice though! Oh the waitress did not recommend the strombolli and I do not recommend the garlic nots. The sauce that comes with them has a funky taste as well."}
{"text":"This pizza is OK. The Stromboli was a little raw. The price was $$$$ being in the NYNY hotel. Hence my 3 stars. The staff is awesome and they deserve 5 stars. 

I ordered a meat lover slice, pepperoni Stromboli and a soda. This all came up to about $23 bucks! 

For these prices I want my pizza to be amazing and my Stromboli to be cooked! Anywho, check them out for yourself as my taste buds could be off."}
{"text":"Although we had a 30 minute wait for our Pizza, the pizza was pretty good and not at all unreasonably priced. It isn't the best pizza by far, but it is tasty and good value. 
It is conveniently located on the second floor of New York, N.Y. near the escalators."}
{"text":"The \"supervisor\" Claribel is the worst kind of manager I've ever seen !! She's so rude and slow !"}
{"text":"Went to get coffee and sat in front of NYP so got a little hungry. Went in and I noticed they make fresh caesars salad so got one then noticed they had an assortment of different slices. Giovani, who is from Sicily, said he sells the meat lovers the most. I'm not a meat lover so he said to try the stuffed  broccoli , spinach , ricotta and mozzarella cheese. It was delicious. Salad was excellent! Had to split all with hubby and daughter even though they first said they weren't hungry! It is a fast good place to eat. I thought it was reasonable got the thick, stuffed slice with salad and it was 10.98. Can't go wrong. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First place I went to here in the hotel. I mean, it is the New York New York Hotel, so it's only right to enjoy some za... That's pizza folks.

The pizza here is fair. Nothing that made me say I'll come back for a late night slice.

Customer service here is... Not that good. Very uninterested. I was waiting in line with no one around, and it seemed like the guy working there and me were having a staring contest. He said nothing to me! Kind of weird, so I just said what I wanted and it got done."}
{"text":"After a night out with friends, I'm pretty sure you could have put dog food in front of me and it would have looked good.  Fortunately for us, we found NY Pizzeria and not Petco!!

Located in NY/NY, NY Pizzeria is conveniently located in a major thoroughfare while walking to our next destination.  Lines are long but move along quickly.  Just sharing the lines with all the clubbers was an experience in itself.  Definitely a lot of interesting people out at that time of night.

The slices are reasonably priced for Vegas, portions are large and the service is good.  There are quite a few tables located just outside the restaurant but if you're with a big group, expect to eat on the run.

Eating pizza after the stroke of midnight is more than likely not a good thing however if you've got those munchies, NY Pizzeria will take care of those for you."}
{"text":"We came here after we saw Zumanity and we were starving. It was closing time, so I know the picks were probably a tad less than if we came in prime dinner time but I still really enjoyed it. Great deals. You can get a giant slice of pizza and a rolling rock beer for $7.77. That's a steal in Vegas."}
{"text":"I had the meat lovers pizza it was ok was not even in my top 10 pizza places at least the service was fast but not the best in vegas"}
{"text":"Well, not sure how to describe, so I'll be blunt.....
The best freakin pizza I've ever had !!!!!  Cheese, sauce, crust, all awesome !"}
{"text":"Overpriced, but what else do you expect in Vegas?

We got a specialty buffalo chicken pizza and side Caesar salad for about $10. I think the slice by itself would have been almost $7, so you might as well get the salad if you're splitting the slice.

The salad was over-dressinged, but the pizza itself was good. You can probably ask the guy to put less dressing in the salad.

Recommended over the pretzel stand across from it, where you see sad, wilted little pretzel pieces (but which smells heavenly). Also, much MUCH better than the pizza place downstairs."}
{"text":"We found the pizza very good but too pricey for what they serve. Service was ok but not spectacular. It was convenient because we spent the day at the New York-New York Casino. But there are better and less expensive alternatives for good New York Style Pizza in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The best pizza we enjoyed in Vegas. The white pizza was a beautiful blend of cheeses & had wonderful balance. Much better than the pizza joint downstairs in the casino or in the shopping center across the street down the block. It doesn't compare to what we've had in New York or where we live in Chicago (we're partial) but it was good enough to inhale on an empty, growling stomach."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza! We got a large veggie pizza and soda. It was reasonably priced. The crust is not too thick or thin it was just right for my taste and the crust was tasty enough that you wanted to eat it.

It is a small place located in the New York New York. We sad outside the little cafe itself and it was fun to watch the crowd go by.

Definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had the Garlic Knots and the tossed-in-front-of-you-by-Tonio Caesar Salad.  I would return just for the caesar salad - it was that good!  The garlic knots were warmed before they were served to me so the butter glistened atop the warm bread."}
{"text":"I dont see why people are complaining? The pizza was great. I liked it.  It was 2:30am. I was tired as hell. The cheese pizza was good. The cheese was extra fresh and aromatic. After each bite the taste just waffed up into the roof my mouth. The cheese was extra fresh. I also burned the roof of my mouth with the pizza. lol"}
{"text":"Roaming around, hungry and sort of buzzed in Vegas. I wanted something hot, fast and cheesy. Somehow ended up here and hey, it did the job. NYP  provided me a cheese pizza
fast, easy, and hot. Lots of cheese on a thin crust. Unfortunately it wasn't crispy like I thought it would be but not bad for a slice of pizza on a late night. The staff is alright, I did have to repeat my order a few times to the worker. Maybe he couldn't hear me?? The person at the register was a bit slow too. We were charging our pizza to the room and for some reason she couldnt figure out how to do it. We ended up just paying for it and took our receipt later to get our points."}
{"text":"$5 for a slice of pizza. When it's 2 am and you've been drinking all day, it's heaven. Centrally located in New York, New York. It's not worth seeking out but if you happen to be near in the area, it's a good cheap choice."}
{"text":"I am originally from the NYC area, it is very hard to fine the quality of pizza I am use to when I am away from my hometown. This place really made me feel like I was back home."}
{"text":"That supervisor Claribel really needs to get disciplined !! She's so rude !!! Everything they do they act like if They want to punch me ."}
{"text":"Not a local. But this was one of the best Pizza I have tried. That will be one of my stops every time I visit LV.  I had a pepperoni and mushroom. The pizaa slice was big center was soft and it had a great crisp on the bottom to top it off. veggie stramboli was cheesy and delicious."}
{"text":"Being from NY, I was going to Grimaldis (outside of Las Vegas) for the best pizza I have had since moving to the west coast. However, I went to this place VERY late at night and ordered a vegetable stromboli. It was absolutely FANTASTIC. Probably the best stromboli I have ever eaten in my life. I haven't tested the pizza so I can't say anything about that but if you are there, give the stromboli a shot! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza for a high price, one slice of mushroom pizza and a side salad $11+ - I used the age-old trick of asking for a cup of water (free).  So I dont think a \"$\" is right for this place, if you get one item and a regular drink you're easily over $10.

They take your item out of the display you ordered it from, put it in the oven to warm it up before handing it to you.

The seating area is a fun spot to people-watch.  Open late, which is why we wound up here."}
{"text":"This place is located New York New York hotel in Las Vegas. Upon my time here for an Arbonne convention at the MGM....this place was very convenient. 

The pizza was pretty good, tastewise. Lots of varieties to choose from. The only thing is that much of it looked like it had been sitting out for a while and didn't look very fresh. Could be that it was mid-afternoon.....but whatever. 

Ultimately, it was good. Not the best ever, but it was convenient and I'd definitely stop again if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Not bad pizza but not the best. It's pretty expensive which is understandable since this is the Las Vegas strip but if you need a late night slice of pie it will do the trick. If your looking for something to stand out or taste like a top notch pizza joint you may want to search around a little bit more."}
{"text":"I love this place! The pizza is delicious. The slices are around $4-$5 a slice but the slices are pretty big. (If you want a bottle of water do not buy it here! They sell aquafina for $3.45!) Other than that its awesome. There are times when it does get busy and you will have to wait in line but its worth it! The best pizzza :)"}
{"text":"Pizza tastes delicious 
I love how thick the layer of topping are and the pizza is thin crust 
A little price my per slice but tastes delicious"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0...I would. My fiancé and I went there to grab something small to eat after a long night of gambling. When my fiancé approached the server to ask for a slice of pizza, the server coughed in his left hand and continued to grab the plate and pizza. We didn't want the slice but didn't want to be rude but the server was very rude to us and asked why we didn't want it. We said 'you just coughed in your hand and served us pizza'. His response was 'I coughed in my left hand but handed you the food with my other hand.' He THEN placed the pizza under the warmer. I feel bad for whoever got that piece of pizza. Everyone behind us saw what happened.

Can't review the food - we didn't eat it."}
{"text":"We were here last trip and it was excellent! I was craving for pepperoni pizza when I got back home in CA.

This time around, it's still good for it's crisp bottom and pepperoni but wasn't as excellent as I remembered. I came by again the next day just in case it was just a bad pizza day, but nope, it was the same. quality wasn't as excellent as it was a few months ago.

Don't get me wrong, I will still eat here if I'm in NYNY but I won't come here just for it.

I don't think this place is cheap, so I can't give it 1 $ sign, I gave it 2 $ signs as a size is about $7."}
{"text":"Dough is better than the stuffs I had in New York City,

Topping and sauce is ok.  My cousin bought by slices, so I know it is pricy.  It is in a Vegas casino.  It is expected.

Ok pizza for high prices.  It is a Vegas casino."}
{"text":"Pizza is pizza right? Wrong!!! This place has amazing Brooklyn style pizza, after a nice walk around the strip we walked to New York New York and you can immediately smell pizza. I was kind of hesitant about the place but my wife really wanted to try it. There was 10 min wait for pizza since they get pretty busy. We had Hawaiian slice which was amazing! They had different types and they all looked good. Definitely should check out"}
{"text":"I decided to eat here before I  left.
I tried the pepperoni which was excellent and I tried a tropical pizza with pineapple ham and veggies which was descent. 
Surprisingly it was better than expected especially the pepperoni!"}
{"text":"I would honestly never ever come back here! sure the food is good but that employee Claribel has the worst attitude ever ! Something needs to be done ."}
{"text":"How can anyone give this disgusting place more than 2 stars?!?!?
To start with the place is a mess and the employees look like they can't stand their job and treat everyone the same...badly!
The pizza is sitting all over the counter tops.  As you order it, they take the cold, old pizza and put it in the over to reheat it.  So, we ordered a calzone and bread knot instead.  BIG mistake! The calzone was probably even worse, a strip of mozzarella, a couple pieces of pepperoni, rolled up and sitting on the counter (hiding) waiting for some sucker to Order it.  Then they burn it to a crisp.
The tables and chairs are disgusting!  We asked for a rag and some cleaning spray and they said they didn't have any????  Ummmmm  how do you clean the back area?  Oh they don't!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a slice of the meat lovers. The ham was better than I expected."}
{"text":"I loved the crust and it was very New York to me.  Slices were thrown in the deck oven and served after a good minute or so.  I thought it was a pretty good slice and the garlic knots were good.  For a Vegas joint, the price on the 6 piece garlic knots were phenomenal.  Want a cheap eat while on the strip?  Get the 6 piece garlic knots that will fill a person up, you can't go wrong there.  Probably the cheapest fill on the strip."}
{"text":"Stopped by after seeing Zumanity - glad it stays open late! Pizza slices were a good size and had a good flavor. There was a bar across the way and it sounded like they were having tons of fun in there - so some entertainment was also included for free ;) Would stop in again if I found myself needing a late night snack in the area."}
{"text":"This place had a pretty tasty pepperoni Stromboli. My only complaints are that it was left in the oven for quite some time, so the bottom had a burnt taste and the prices were insane.. But I guess that's Vegas for ya."}
{"text":"Ordered a cheese slice - it was oily and appearance wasn't the best, but it satisfied my craving. Expensive for $6 for just a slice of plain cheese pizza though. Line moved slow at midnight on a Friday."}
{"text":"Tried this place while having a beer at Pour 24! Had a stuffed slice with Ricotta, Spinach, and Broccoli! I thought it a bit pricey, however the stuffed slices are quite large, and mine was delicious!
There are regularNY Style slices as well, but they are only $1.00 les than a stuffed slice and rather small for the cost! I think the SS is the way to go!
The marina was tasty as well!
They have salads, rather small Strombolis, and Garlic Knots as well!
Definitely worth a stop if your in NYNY!"}
{"text":"I really felt like I was in New York! Came here for a late night snack after the Zumanity show. Pizza is my favorite and the pizza here was so good! It was thinly crust just how I like it and so tasty. Will def come again!"}
{"text":"Number one the lady at the register was on her phone and charged us for the incorrect items. Number two the food was awful and way over priced for the quality."}
{"text":"Late night pizza , hit the spot delicious, decent price for vegas.  I enjoyed the supreme slice ...1 slice will do trust me."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by here after catching the Zumanity show, and I wasnt sure how good the pizza was going to be.  But, I ordered a slice anyways it was $8.50 for a slice and bottle of water or $6.50 for a slice and a beer.  I ordered the pepperoni, delicious, perfect flavor and consistency.  Unfortunately after consuming this perfect example of what pizza should be, I spent the rest of the trip trying to relive that feeling at different pizza places with much worse results"}
{"text":"The pizza here is great! Lots of flavor! They warm it up for you in the oven because it's served by the slice so the bottom gets crispy. But it's really expensive for 1 piece for like $8. However, it's on the strip so it's not that bad.

For some reason they only have huge fountain sodas which could be a plus for some. 

There's a heavy set older man who is extremely rude. Idk what his deal is but if he doesn't like working there then he should quit or not have interaction with the customers."}
{"text":"I have never been to New York, so I have no idea what a pizza from there should taste like. With that being said, the slice of pie I had from NYP was pretty dam tasty.

Thin crust, zesty sauce, tasty toppings, and herbs -- what more could you want?! I was also glad that I ordered some garlic knots, because of the spicy kick, and the delicious dipping sauce they came with.

Next time I'm in Vegas, I will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Waited in line way to long for the girl to not even know what pizza I got. Pathetic. If this was New York, they'd definitely be out of business"}
{"text":"I got a slice of pepperoni and it was really good. Was a little to greasy, But if you don't mind that, it's worth it for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"This place would've gotten 5 stars, but the customer service skills here suck. 

This isn't Dick's.

You line up and let the person behind the counter know what kind of pizza you want. We had choices in front of us like meat lovers, cheese, veggie... we didn't see pepperoni, so when I asked, the guy was snooty and said yea.... like of course, it's a pizza place... but it was not in the window, so I asked. I also ordered a garlic knot. 6 for $3.95 was too many, so we got the 1 for $.95
It only took a few minutes, but it was the longest few minutes in the world because it was so uncomfortable. They didn't talk to you or welcome you. They had sad looks on their faces and it felt like asking them for ranch was like pulling teeth. We sat just outside of the establishment and the pizza was great. Thin sliced New York style, of course. Sauce was good, not too sweet. The crust was not bland. It was a good slice. The garlic knot was good, too. Fluffy bread, not much garlic, just enough and it is served with hot marinara."}
{"text":"The food was GREAT. The only reason why I am leaving 3 stars is because of the a very nasty and unpleasant employee named Maria. She was very unprofessional and extremely rude. If it wasn't for her this place would have gotten 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"We were in line & we order pizza that had to be made Ricky told his manger in a rude manner way that he wasn't going to make that pizza ! I understand he has other task to do but don't be rude to the manager in front of customers ! Manger was nice though"}
{"text":"I love pizza. any pizza. Don't take my opinion on it.

$5 for slice, and $5 for a draft beer."}
{"text":"Not worth. Got a thin, okay tasting slice of pizza and a mediocre tasting garlic knot for $8.98. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The service was awful. Mixed up orders in front of me, behind me and mine too. The girl was so rude on top of that. Won't go back and casts an unpleasant shadow on New York New York."}
{"text":"Needed to get up from playing Black Jack and grab a bite while in the New York Casino.
Got the stuffed pizza once and a regular slice my second time there.
Food was good, crust was that NY style of crunchy and chewy together.
$5 for a regular slice, and $7 for the stuffed. For the amount of food, go with the stuffed- just a better deal. Flavorful sauce. Good selection. Once you order, they put your slice back in the oven for a few minutes, and boy is that yummy! A definite do-over if I go back to Vegas.
They give a military discount. Just happened to find that out when I showed my military ID when using my credit card there. Very nice!! Surprised to find THAT in Vegas.
If you want something quick, and are tired of being 'taken' by all those pricey places, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Good pizza nice big slice gentleman serving was polite rapid service but location is too small pizza was dank"}
{"text":"Antonio is awesome! He made our whole experience tonight, he was happy, friendly and gave me a fist bump. He's a  friendly guy serving the best pizza I have honestly had!!! Wow! Great service and pizza here from a friendly funny cool staff!!  

You guys rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Hey Antonio stay away from my gf, you stud! 
She can't stop smiling at you!"}
{"text":"The pepperoni and garlic knots tasted absolutely AWESOME at 3 am after a night of partying and drinking :) 

they had a long line and of course it might be because they're one of the few open places at this time, BUT it might also be because its pretty decent food for a fast food joint inside the NYNY hotel.
They had your typical pizza by the slice and regular side options you could chose from and it was reasonably priced.
So next time if you're tired of all the other fast food places and are around here, try it out ;)"}
{"text":"You have a wonderful Italian place there at nyny and yet this little place is great too. A fraction of the cost and yet same great quality for a slice"}
{"text":"NYP's pizza and stromboli are very tasty and fresh. The price is a bit much, but it's more or less what you would expect from a casino.  The seating is specific to the pizzeria, but the overall atmosphere is reminiscent of a food court."}
{"text":"I loved this place. It was about the only place where you could get a slice of pizza for $5 and feel full when you didn't want to spend the high prices on food in Vegas. I would definitely recommend coming here if you want something quick and cheap."}
{"text":"This is the real deal if you're looking for authentic NY style pizza! No joke, I moved to LA and this is the one food I can't find anywhere so whenever I come to Vegas I come here at least a few times. If you've never been to NY and want your foo foo west coast pizza don't come here! Stay away and keep your hate with you."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I had while visiting Vegas! Hubby and I stopped for a drink at the bar across from this place and grabbed a few slices from NYP. Pizza slices are big and we especially loved how there was an immediate crunch after your first bite! Some places make their crust a little too dough-y and I thought NYP perfected it according to my personal liking! Will definitely be back if I'm ever on the strip!"}
{"text":"La pizza es riquisima y es barato, que mas se puede pedir."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a greasy pizza place, but it fits in perfectly on a late night.

I admit that I had low expectations going in, but the pizza was way better than I expected. I would happily eat this pizza sober, which makes it 5-star drunk pizza in my book."}
{"text":"Right at the entrance from MGM into NYNY at the Mezzanine level

We got Ian a 4 cheese Pizza slice, and the Mrs. got a Stuffed Slice.
Total with tax came to $16.18

Pros:
None.

Cons:
Weird set up to pay at the counter. I am used to the Metal tag at Blaze pizza etc. so the heat up process on the ready made pizza was a little bit confusing.
Tasted nothing like a New York Pizza. Mrs. threw the Stuffed Slice away after taking a couple of bites. (-2)"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick bite to eat, this is your place. Pizza is always good, and can't beat the price point for being on the strip. I always make it a point to stop by here when in town."}
{"text":"Pretty much the greatest dough and perfectly sweet tomato sauce I've ever had. I'm absolutely a fan of NY style pizza, and I look forward to having it whenever I go back to vegas!"}
{"text":"Vegas Pizza Crawl 2016: Being from NY I normally would never bother trying \"NY style\" pizza in Vegas but after how daunted we'd been by the multi-hour line at Oyster Bar in Palace Station we wanted something relatively fast and cheap, and that devolved into deciding to try ALL the pizza at NY, NY.

This was surprisingly not as bad as I was expecting considering all the awful \"NY style\" pizza I've been subjected to in LA, but it was not as good as the pizza at the Nathan's by the arcade (not at New York Pretzel which serves Nathan's hot dogs, but the standalone Nathan's by the arcade). The sauce here was sweet and had a weird aftertaste. Had to cover it with chili flakes and oregano. The crust wasn't bad but it had the wrong kind of crunch. Skip this one and go to Nathan's by the arcade and get a slice, a hot dog, and cheese fries."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to this place about 5 days ago..the pizza was good BUT that Caesar Salad has not left our minds since leaving there. It was honestly the best Caesar Salad we have ever had and I'm not one to normally crave Salad! This will be our first stop on our next trip to Vegas. Seriously, tho...get the Caesar Salad!!!!"}
{"text":"Huh?  What's with all the four star reviews?

Wife and I needed a quick snack, and since we were in NYNY, she wondered whether there was any NY style pizza available.  Will this new restaurant shining from the corner of eye, we went in to give it a whirl.

Cheese Pizza:  Tasty, but only slightly better than what you get at the local Sbarro's in the malls across America.  Decent support on the crust with a mostly forgettable sauce, covered in a respectable quality cheese that wasn't overly greasy or dripping.

Personally, I think the pizza here is okay.  It may get some hard core business for two reasons:  1.  being surrounded by ridiculously priced food in Vegas.  2.  It's open late enough to catch the club crowd post hours looking for a quick bite.

Verdict:  This is not worth going out of your way for to try.  It's an okay made pizza that doesn't bust your wallet when you're in Vegas, but can't compare to the $4 slices that are more flavorful and larger that you can in NY proper or Chicago.  I won't be back, solely because I'd rather save my money for another few slot pulls or a higher end meal."}
{"text":"The food is solid, but the service is bad.  There was not much of a line, but yet it took sometime just to place our order.  There were plenty of employees working they just seemed to be in no hurry to do anything.  After repeating our order a few times we were confident enough to move on.

The person at the register was friendly, but also lacking motivation.  Once again after repeating our order a few times we paid.  The cashier does think to ask if you need a drink, but does nothing after that.  Every person we saw go through had to ask for their drink when they got their food.

The wait for your food to heat up is fine.  Once again we repeated our order a few times before eventually leaving with everything we ordered.

The food was tasty.  It is not great, but good for its price point.  While the prices are higher, you do get a decent amount for your money.  I had a sausage stromboli.  It had solid flavor.  It seemed quite similar to Sabarro.  I also had a garlic knot.  It was ok."}
{"text":"Hands down, best pizza in vegas. Not sure  if it's  because me and my boyfriend  come here when  we are drunk, or simply  due to the fact they have the best tasting pizza. doesn't matter.  They always give us exceptional customer service and great tasting pizza.  This place is our GO TO place for pizza whenever we come to Vegas EVERY TIME"}
{"text":"Good pizza but a little overpriced. Slices were big thankfully but I don't agree paying $24.54 for two people and that includes water, soda and a roll. Maybe $18-20 is reasonable but almost $25? Come on."}
{"text":"I had high expectations but it turned out to be just an OK experience. 

Now mind you I only had the ham and cheese Stromboli and did not go with the pizza option so maybe a slice is what I should of gotten. 

What I didn't realize is that they have pre-made cold slices and Stromboli and you pick which kind you want and they heat it up in their oven. 

I am assuming everything is hand-tossed and made there earlier but I just wasn't expecting cold pizza to be reheated. 

The Stromboli was very cheesy and had good taste, although it turned out to be just too much cheese for me so I did not finish all the way. 

I think I may of built this place up too much in my head before stopping in since I was expecting a more authentic NYC pizza/Stromboli experience."}
{"text":"I eat here 2 times.. one of those times on new years eve after the party on the new york bridge bash... the cuatro estaciones (four cheeses) pizza.. yammie.. i love the pizzas like this.. thin crost, nicely filled up with 4 cheeses, little greasy thats how i personally like it... they had a special.. a slice of pizza with a beer 10 bugs.. also one older italian guy working behind the counter was real funny and reminded me of a waiter is little italy new york... with the new yorker accent... i really enjoyed this place for a quick snack when your hungry and its nice to sit in the \"new york Streets\" with the rollercoaster coming up above you!!"}
{"text":"Over priced for a whole pie. If your looking for a single slice it's ok, but have had much better."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try New York style pizza but if I'm being honest it was just okay. However the customer service was great.  They were pretty busy when I ordered but the food came out quickly.  My biggest complaint was that both mine and my friends dough seemed a little undercooked. I did still enjoy the pizza and the size of the slice was awesome."}
{"text":"One of the few decent pies on the strip.  All the employees were friendly and eager to wait on us.  This was a good crispy, thin crust pizza.  Would visit again."}
{"text":"The pizza here was decent. The hubby and I shared a slice of cheese pizza. He also got two garlic knots with marinara sauce. We washed everything down with a  Dr. Brown's root beer.

For $5.45, the slice wasn't that huge and it was thin crust. Since it was thin crust, I was hoping that it would be crispy, but it wasn't. The pizza wasn't overly salty. The sauce had a nice seasoning to it. The garlic knots were awesome. They were just buttery, garlicky, and soft. I dipped it into the marinara sauce and stuffed it into my mouth. It made my tastebuds happy. 

The guy working there was cool. They were having this promotion with this mug. It was $10 but you could get free refills at any of their restaurants with a purchase. Without a purchase, it was $1 or something like that. He wasn't trying to sell it to me or anything. I noticed it and asked him about it. He took his time explaining it to me."}
{"text":"Ordered a ham Stromboli only to find it full of raw dough. It was fully uncooked and totally disgusting!"}
{"text":"The pizza here was surprisingly good for a no-frills cafe tucked in New York New York. Our group had been to Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan the night before, and there was a 5 minute discussion about whether this pizza was possibly better than the wildly popular Secret Pizza. My opinion is that Secret Pizza won out on flavor, but New York Pizzeria had better crust, cheese/sauce/bread balance, and faster service.

If you're at the casino and have a hankering for some serious carbs, come to New York Pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Good old fashion pizza. Located in the New York New York Hotel. Can't get any better than a NY slice of pizza.  

After the clubs, we wanted to get a quick bite. And NY Pizzeria was open. 

Walk in cafeteria style, tell which pizza you want, grab a drink, pay and go!
Find a place to sit outside, which there is plenty of.

Pizza tastes so good, so late at night. And it was a nice big slice. The pizza hit the spot.  Check it out when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The pizza was 'ok', i got the bacon cheese one... the 'pizza sandwich thing' with the cheese and broccoli, was a lot better!"}
{"text":"Great location to grab a quick slice. Price was a little higher then what I would have expected. Pizza was good and the garlic knot could have used more butter."}
{"text":"We walked through NY NY to get to the Luxor and as soon as we walked in all we could smell was pizza. We live in Florida now and it is hard to come by good pizza. Glad we stopped in. It was excellent."}
{"text":"Deeeeeeeeeeeelicious pizza :)

Very yummy, even ate the crust which I normally don't hehe

The only thing I didn't like is their customer service.  The ladies that helped me, were a bit rude.......

Other then that, a must try place in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Good pizza, nice and fresh but a little skimpy with the meat. More meat would've made it GREAT!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big eater which qualifies me as a restaurant critic. This place is great. Pizza was delicious and the garlic knots make me want to do a cartwheel. I won't do a cartwheel because I'm fat and have a bad ankle,  and I'm stuffed with awesome pizza, but I really want to do a cartwheel. I'm performing across the street at the Laugh Factory and I'll be doing a bit about how good the garlic knots are. You should come by. About 830 or 1030pm. Bye."}
{"text":"First of all we weren't even greeted walking in. They all looked like they hated their jobs. Then I was asking what a certain pizza was and just got an unmotivated answer. Then asked how big a side salad was and the girl almost mugged me and pulled out the plate and just pointed at it. We got 2 slices anyways because it looked good. Slices were big. But cold so they reheat to order and heated it so much I burnt my mouth then had to wait 5mins to take another bite. Pizza was soggy and flimsy, not crispy at all! The garlic knot was so plain. and when our food was ready they just said \"here's ur food\" in a rude way. We had to walk through people in line to grab our food. And 2 slices and one drink side salad and one boring garlic knot was $25, pretty pricey but that's vegas regardless. Next time I would just go get little Cesar's!!!!"}
{"text":"Quick, greasy, doughy but cheap and filling. Ok in a pinch but stick with pizza not salad.
Antipasto was not antipasto. It was lettuce, shredded cheese, olives, pepperinchinis, and stuck together icky pepperoni."}
{"text":"Decent pizza. The price is high for the quality pizza. You can find better slices at the pizza place on the first floor of the casino. I like a side salad with my pizza and they only have Caesar, which I do not like. My favorite item was the garlic knots."}
{"text":"Not sure how we spent $70 on 5 slices of pizza, 3 strombolis and 2 sodas. Pizza was good, but the strombolis were pouring grease."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. Had a fresh slice of the meat lovers. However the customer was awful. Dealt with 3 employees and strangely all 3 seemed like they couldn't have cared less. Slightly rude too.

That said. The food is solid. Better than other pizza places in New York New York."}
{"text":"Honestly wasn't expecting much from this place. I was hungry and this place was the closest pizza place. I was actually surprised by how good the pizza was. Never been to New York but if some small Vegas pizza joint can serve this good of a pie, I'm expecting a lot in NYC."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza on The Strip!

Located inside of New York New York, they are also open really late and situated right next to a bar. So its not that tragic they don't sell beer hear. I ordered 2 slices of cheese, grabbed a beer at the bar, and hit the casino, and as I left New York New York, I stopped by and grabbed another slice of the Hawaiian for the walk back to my hotel. Too bad they don't deliver...

There are rumors that this place imports water from New York to put into the dough- and if you know anything about pizza, the dough is the foundation for an awesome pie. Who knows if this is true, but its pretty damn good pizza."}
{"text":"This is the place to go to if you've had a bit too many and need to absorb some of your liquid libations. I think I was too sober to enjoy it like it's meant to be consumed. I ordered a slice of veggie....it was the last one....it was that or pepperoni and sausage if I didn't want to wait. Unfortunately it was basically cold when I paid and tasted like it had been sitting out for awhile. I didn't see cheese or peppers anywhere which was surprising. For almost seven dollars I wish I would have gone somewhere else but I can cross pizza off my list for this trip."}
{"text":"Anyone who doesn't think this pizza is good is insane! Not the best pizza I've ever had mind u, but fucking great all the same!!!

-BBQ chicken slice: needed more BBQ sauce, got a side for dipping. Great pizza though

-mushroom: was very good

-stuffed everything: my fav. The sesame seeds on the top are what make this sublime. Careful though. The insides are scorching hot and will remain so for at least 20 min because no air gets inside. 

-pepperoni: sucked. Nothing special

-garlic knot: was good. Had better, but also had worse

-meat lovers: very greasy but delicious

7$ a slice but worth it. Slices are huge!!!"}
{"text":"hard to find tasty and reasonal priced food. This one is one of them. i ordered stuffed. Taste great,quick, free water, and friendly people."}
{"text":"Loved it! I figured since it was inside New york, new york hotel/casino that we couldn't go wrong with this place being new york style. This is the first stromboli i've ever and it was so amazing. It was ham stomboli. My boyfriend got the calzone and liked it too. It was hard to get a table but that's cause it's obviously popular. Especially when you do not want a restaurant and prefer something faster but yet you can still sit down and eat. Would come back if ever in Vegas again."}
{"text":"The pizza downstairs was way better. Very greasy and not worth the price that I paid. (3/6/12)"}
{"text":"We are here vacationing in Las Vegas for the first time. As we walked past this restaurant, we couldn't help but stop because the food smelled amazing! We were able to choose from multiple pizza toppings. After you select it they heat up the slice and check you out (quick and easy)! I will definitely be eating here again during my stay."}
