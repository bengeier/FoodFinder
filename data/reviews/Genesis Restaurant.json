{"text":"2 stars because the convenience of being so near the strip is definitely a plus. 
However we were there when it was hardly busy at all. There was one waitress struggling to serve everyone. We waited 15 minutes for our orders to be taken, 20 minutes for food and another 15 minutes for her to find change for our payment! 
The food was nothing special for the price. 
Falafel came 6 on a small plate with no pitta bread. The meat plate was ok. Chicken skewer was the best part with the BBQ outside."}
{"text":"Excellent experience at Genesis.  I have been coming to Vegas for many years and watching mediocre restaurants come and go.  This place is the real deal.  The food was excellent (and I mean really really good), the service was great, and the ambiance was very nice.  It is pretty close to the strip which is a nice bonus.  I hope this plays does well and stays around a long time.  I will be back for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Food.  Insanely clean.  Not a single speck on the utensils.  Great protection too to protect the Jewish family."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef skewers ( with a side of Israeli salad) and the crunchy salmon roll. 

The crunchy salmon roll was bland, although the fish tasted fresh. I would have liked more flavor in the roll, considering it was one of the more expensive rolls from the menu. 

The beef skewers were not well marinated and slightly overcooked; the pieces were lacking that delicious \"juiciness\" I usually expect from beef skewers.  Perhaps I should have told the waiter too keep it \" medium rare\" on the grill. My biggest discontent with the beef skewers was the presence of many fat pieces accompanying the meat within the beef. My jaw couldn't handle the back and forth of such pieces, and I was forced to discard them : (

The interior designing seems inviting, although I didn't understand the wall paper selection. The seating on the periphery of the dining hall was set up with booth seating. The center of the hall had used tables and chair pieces as seating options. This sitting combination was confusing.

The service was 4/5. I was slightly confused when we had several waiters approach us at different times to ask us what we would like to order. I, like most customers, would appreciate a more seamless ( and non-redudant) service.

Overall, I wish I had tried their Chinese menu selections. Perhaps they cook their Chinese dishes better.

One thing I did really enjoy: Their huge advertising sign in the parking lot. You could see it at least half a mile ahead of you if you are on the street. 

I don't think I will be coming back as the prices are too high for me."}
{"text":"Food was very mediocre and not properly prepared.Some food was greasy, some was cold in the center... And others undercooked.

many menu items I asked for they didn't have at all, The service was absolutely horrible and could not find the waitress or even pay when we were done for a good 25 minutes.

I went here because some family members eat kosher, but they were very disappointed as well.

A few items are decent, but definitely not worth returning to this place."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant  i ever went to in my life and in las vegas so expensive  with small  portions  that we had to go home and have dinner again . The  salad  was saggy  and dessert  was so bad.  The customer   service  was very bad rude employees. 
Do not  recommend  this  restaurant  to anyone . 
Bad food and horrible customer  service , save your time and money don't  go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and there was excellent customer service. I would definitely eat there again. Very classy and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a total of three times. I first of all love the ambiance. It has a very warm feeling, cherrywood with touches of silver and a soft baby blue. The tables are covered in linen and polished glasses and fine silverware.
So you are seated and your waiter will bring to your table five different delicious before the meal middle eastern delicacies, accompanied by warm pita.
I had a roasted half chicken with couscous. The chicken was classic juicy tender very high quality seasoned and cooked just right. The couscous was paired with special Flavors that perfected that classic dish. My server was there with a smile and friendly accommodating attitude. This was a fabulous fine dining experience, that I am looking forward to doing again as soon as possible."}
{"text":"My friend Jeff Salc took me here..I am in love it is the best restaurant around  that area. And has a very wonderful vibe!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple days ago . Very over priced and horrible tasting food. I will not return ."}
{"text":"We love eating here, very quit and pleasant place to dine in, the serve severals dishes from Israeli style food to Asian and even Moroccan traditional delicious food!
And its strictly kosher which makes the whole thing perfect ! Must visit here if you in vegas or the area!"}
{"text":"Over price 
You will come hungry and leave starving!
Soda can 2.99 plus tax.  Yes 3 bucks for soda can 
No refill 

Tip will get added on you bill for party of 2 or more 
Very sad and expensive place 
Forget it 
Never again will return !!"}
{"text":"I went there their first day. We had a great dinner. The shnitzel was very generous in size . i would go there again"}
{"text":"When we went we got a burger and chicken. Both were well made and delicious. Fries were standard, nothing out of the ordinary and the kids meal was also kind of OK but they nailed the main courses. Staff was prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with Genesis. Those of you that have gone will understand what I'm talking about. They have two restaurants next door to each other - one meat and one dairy. It sounds convenient but..."}
{"text":"Great food, very friendly, reasonable prices.  Ask for Shlomo. Terrific experience overall."}
{"text":"Holy overpriced mediocrity, Batman! This place is horrendously overpriced- just like Panini Cafe, this restaurant tries to take advantage of the lack of Kosher restaurants in town by jacking up the prices and putting out mediocrity. 

$8 Matzo ball soup is the size most places call a CUP of soup, except it's also twice the price here. Bagel Cafe's version is easily three times the size, more flavor, better quality. Portion was bland broth, matzo, two pieces of carrots and a bite of overcooked noodles. BF enjoys the light flavors of Kosher food, but even he can't justify the outrageous pricing- this should be half the price that it is.
$11 house shwarma wrap was also okay, but the meat was underseasoned- wrap on pita contained a bland smear of hummus, a few pieces of cucumber and tomato, and a generous amount of the chicken. Too bad only the bottom half of the wrap had any flavor, where the ingredients all mixed together. 

If you aren't required to keep Kosher, I can think of no reason you'd come here. Entrees sound halfway decent, but they are nearly all a flat $25 with some going as high as $38. I'm aware that Kosher restaurants are limited, but when you're considered overpriced in a city FULL of overpriced restaurants, you at least need to have the quality to back it up."}
{"text":"I was less than happy. The guy seemed friendly at first. Showed me how ro eat the appetizer, which I thought would be a bowl of salad. Said free refill, but didn't come back. I ordered salad because it was all I could afford. Mutually unfriendly exit."}
{"text":"As a frequent traveler to las Vegas as well as I only eat kosher I tend to hit all the kosher restaurants around the strip 
When I came across Genesis I came across the most decent kosher place to eat at in Las Vegas 
The food is very good 
I had a shawarma plate as well as kebab and a Yemenite soup 
Everything was good but not WOW 
Service is slightly not that good but for Las Vegas you won't be able to find better then that"}
{"text":"New owners! The food and service are amazing. This is truly a place you can feel proud to bring your friends and business associates to. There's no need to compromise standards just because you are Kosher. It's the only place in Vegas with Kosher Chinese food and if you are vegetarian just let them know and they will make you a dish that's not even on the menu yet. There is a party room available for your own private gatherings which is perfect size for a sheva brachot for example. There's a small children's menus and nice clean high chairs for the little ones. Some of the booths are arranged in round circles just nice for a family. Very convenient for guests staying near the strip but also for the locals as well. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"What a great selection for Kosher food! The Chinese I got was flavorful and authentic, with just the right amount of spice. My friend got the combo plate with Shawarma, a kebab, chicken skewer, rice, and salad. So good! You can trust it's safe, the mashgiach is always nearby. They also do meals for Shabbat, we ordered ours with Schlomo while we were there for dinner. Very easy and they even delivered! I'll definitely bring more friends and family here, even though most of them don't eat Kosher!"}
{"text":"They are working the kinks out of the service but the food was worth the wait! Had the avocado roll, egg roll, orange chicken, sesame chicken. So happy for a good restaurant, pretty, pleasant service, and amazing, made to order food that is obviously made with a caring hand.  Keep it up and we will be back a bunch! KOL Ha KAVODE!"}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place. We started on a positive note--the salad. It was a number of small bowls featuring things like hummus, slaw, pickles, corn relish. Enough for the 3 of us to try a little of everything. The problem was the entrees.  One of our party and I got the shwarma. The small pieces of turkey and lamb were overlooked and chewy, like they had been warmed up. It was also dry. The other member got the chicken cutlet, which she said was tasteless.   Service was ok. In fact, meals were served when we were only half way thru the salads."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and very good !!  The service is awesome is fast and very good !! The price is very affordable and the place look very fancy and very clean , I will definitely come to this place again"}
{"text":"I can't imagine what could have been better during our visit to Genesis.  The service was warm and welcoming, and infant, we were treated like old friends or even family!

The food itself was absolutely delicious!  I took my mother, visiting from Pasadena, and it became the highlight of the visit.

I think the best thing one could say of a restaurant is that they can't wait to go back, and that certainly applies here.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The best Israeli restaurant in Vegas...
The best Chinese food in Vegas...
And the owner is very nice and give you the felling that you home(Shlomei) so go and have fun...."}
{"text":"This place pissed me off so badly.  I have no kosher 
schwarma in phoenix.   I stayed up all night Saturday to get some food Sunday morning.   Their site says  open at 10 am.  I called at 10 am and they told me not open for 1.5 hours.  Are you kidding  ?  I hope this place goes out of business asap. So rude on phone"}
{"text":"This is our 1st time to this Israeli restaurant. The food is ok but I'm sorry to say that the service really made us inconvenient. It took 10 mins to order food and the waitress mistook the order. Hope they would do it better."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the owners are wonderful.  Hummus steak skewers and Asian food were all phenomenal"}
{"text":"This restaurant is under new management. They are re naming it King Solomon's Table. The owners were extremely nice. The service was very quick and the waitresses were warm and gracious.  The morrocan cigars and kibbe were delicious.  The decor is classy and has an elegant feel. We ordered schnitzel and it was nice, hot and crispy.  Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a kosher place not far from the strip."}
{"text":"Its ok. Ok service. Portions too small and food not very hot. But tastes nothing special. Prices way too high. Salad was the size of a mirco muffin. May be because of lack of kosher resturants its like that. My recommendation is pls make better food and lower prices and bigger portions . May be you will have more customers . Thanks"}
{"text":"A delicious kosher restaurant.. We came here with our friends for a business dinner and we really had a good time.. Restaurant is not to noisy and the tables are not closed.. The staff is very kindfull and they are allways smailing.. We really liked this place and we'll come whenever we come to Las Vegas ever after.. Thanks.."}

{"text":"Went for dinner with two business associates who do not observe kosher laws. The seevice was quick and efficient. Our soda's were refilled. The place was clean and well lit. We were greeted immediately and served timely. There were other patrons in the restaurant. The food was cooked well and the portions were a nice size."}
{"text":"For a long time I didn't had such a great home made food as I had in genesis !
The owner is such a nice and kind person they have such a great customer service .
Honestly if you visiting Las Vegas and not stoping here for a lunch/dinner you losing !!!
Thank you so much !"}
{"text":"I'll
Give this place a 2 stars because I believe the place will get better as they expand. I came here after l being open for only 9 days. 
However, the prices are extremely over priced. Morracan cigars shouldnt cost the amount they do. Neither should the main entrees. They are waaaaaaaaay to over priced.

But the food I did eat was good. I can't deny that. Try the shwarma. I did want matzah ball soup and they were out of it and it was only 9pm.

This place can be great. But they need to not charge $23 for a frickin stuffed bell pepper. I mean come on. That's just robbery. Kosher fraud at its finest!"}
{"text":"I'm just going to flat out say it. This place would have received a much better rating had the food come out hot. I'm going to break this out into Pros and Cons to make this easier to understand why I went this way in my rating.

Pros:

They had kibbeh - It's already hard to find this on most menus but this was a must order for me when I saw it on the menu.

The sides were great - We had our whole table ranting and raving about how good the sides were and it got us really excited for the meal ahead of us.

Service - It was great and the staff were really attentive.

Cons

Heat Issues - Some of our food came out cold (this was the case for some of the aforementioned kibbeh) and I heard ssimilar comments from other tables while we were there. I'm going to go ahead and suspecct that a lot of our meals were reheated.

Butchering - They either butcher in house or they have a terrible butcher (for chicken at least). I had pieces of cartilage on my skewer of chicken which I found annoying to eat.

Pricing - I found the pricing a bit higher than what I'm accustomed to, even for a kosher restaurant.

Hamburgers misplaced? - This is more me nitpicking on the menu. But I found it a little surprising that the Hamburger was put under \"Mediterranean Classic\". I would have assumed that it would have bee under sandwiches.

Chinese/Israeli? - It's not even fusion. It's just 2 different food offerings that I'm not 100% certain why there are 2 different cuisines available. But if it works, who am I to judge?

The food is good here. but the heating concerns alone are a larger enough to be wary of this place. I'll definitely give it another try because the food did taste good and the staff were so friendly and accommodating. I just can't give it a higher one until a few things are changed."}

{"text":"I ate at this place last night.
When I was trying to figure out why I go out to restaurants, I decided that the service alone can sometimes be the difference between a good and bad review. 
I mean, if the type of food, quality of food, potion size, and prices are roughly the same between two restaurants, then you're left with atmosphere and service.
Well, the service in this place was very poor. 
Conservatively, I would say that it took 7 requests (to multiple waiters), before we could place our order.
And the hostess ended up taking it.
The place was virtually empty (customers at 4 tables out of 25.)
The ratio of servers to tables was basically 1:1.
At one point the servers were playing with the lights, clicking them on and off, oblivious to how annoying that was.
The only reason I gave 2 stars was because of the hostess and the food (which was fine but not great.)
If this place looks at their Yelp reviews, I want them to know that this review is not personal, it's objective.
I know that they are a new restaurant (and one block away from a serious competitor).
I am merely suggesting what they should consider changing in order for them to be more successful."}
{"text":"Favorite kosher dining option in Las Vegas. Was there during Nine Days, so I stuck to the fish. Ordered a grilled Tilapia filet. It was nicely seasoned and grilled, cooked perfectly. Came with great french fries (crispy and golden brown on outside, tender inside), and nice side salad of greens. It was filling, very tasty, and service was very accommodating. I would gladly eat here again. Ambiance was a white table-cloth sit-down restaurant. But the menu was basically the same as all the other kosher meat restaurants in Vegas... not much creativity, nothing unique. What they do make, they make well. Traveling in the US for work and keeping kosher, one can't be too picky outside of NYC and LA, but this place is worthwhile as the the best Vegas option in my opinion."}
{"text":"Me and my husband come to Vegas every other month and always visit one of the Kosher restaurants. No offense to the previous owner but the food was not good before. The new owner was great, very friendly, he even let us in after it was closed already! The food was GREAT too! Was more than happy we made it here!"}
{"text":"We travel and eat out at a lot of kosher restaurants, and with that in mind I have to say this was the worst dining experience that I've ever had. 
When we arrived, we were the only ones in the restaurant, we ordered the number of things were not available even though they were on the menu. We ordered the Moroccan soup which was great, but the mains which were primarily Chinese food and hummus platters were so salty they were nearly inedible. Upon getting our bill we realized that every price was different than it was on the menu, when asking for clarification the owner explained that he up charged for all of the things which are listed on the menu but have no prices. The result was a bill nearly 30% above sticker price without a single caveat or price listed anywhere on their menu or from the server.
My wife grabbed a menu to compare prices at which point the owner got combative and forced her to give back the menus. The owner at that point took away our bill not allowing us to pay while screaming across the restaurant in front of the few tables which had come in at this point.
We remembered the inflated belt price and simply pay that in cash just to get out of there, but in many years of eating at kosher restaurants this was by far the most inappropriate, uncomfortable and ridiculously negative experience I have ever seen. Comparing that to how wonderful some of the other restaurants in town are make me question why anybody would ever go here"}
{"text":"went there  for dinner.  The service was fast and easy.  Place is clean and upscale.  Food was amazing.  A little on the pricy side but worth it when you see the portion.
we will for  sure be going back."}
{"text":"A friend dragged me there (Yesterday) to grab a quick bite to eat, nice place, nice decor.
Top notch so far.
The greeter (owner? manger?) was cool enough yet the rest of the greet staff needs help.
But lets start from the top, we were a party of 3 in the afternoon, the place is nearly empty, other then us there are only 2 other occupied tables, we were seated and the waitress came over to take our order, skimming thru the menu was followed by a sticker shock, holy moly...just about %40 more then any other \"equivalent\". joint around town.
Ow well, lets order, we ordered one Humus plate, assorted salad plate and a \"schnitzel\", came with pita bread., we also ordered water.
First problem: the food arrived before the drinks, fail #1 
The Humus was ok, the salads were mainly ok, (the eggplant salad had a weird taste and was  left in the plate, the schnitzel was liked ($20)
As we were done with our food we set....(fail #2).and set until I got up and asked the greeter where the waitress was/is, we discovered that she left but there is a waiter (haven't seen him so far), any way, the greeter brought us the check, we paid and took off.
Conclusion:
1. Nice place and the fanciest Kosher joint in Vegas
2. The food is OK, I tasted nothing out of the ordinary (other then the eggplant)
3  service needs improvement, pronto. What is the norm in Tel Aviv does not work in the western world folks! get with the program.
4. The prices are out of sight.

But of coerce.....and with my experience with different Kosher joints around the nation, non of my revue matters, nothing will be changes and the norm will remain, with captured audience you don't need excellence, you can afford to be mediocre and expensive, its not like they have anywhere else to go in a 5 mile radius.

PS, The booths are extremely tight, if you are over size 32(pants) ask for a table of suffer."}
{"text":"Bad Service!!!!
We were asking for 4 schnitzel (milanesa) baguettes ,one of the schnitzel baguette we ask without spicy in it , and one of the other schnitzel baguette we ask to remove the vegetables that supposed to come with it and serve it separate in a plastic container or something .

We wore asking for 2 chicken thigh baguettes , 
And chicken nuggets for the kids..

We were asking for ketchup mayonnaise and mustard and also to add some side salads and we will pay for it occurs .

The representative on the line  Took all the  orders and said that the delivery would cost $20.

We agreed  and double confirm the order when the delivery guy arrive to the MGM Hotel he gave us the bags with the food inside and left..
I took the order upstairs to the room and was surprised to find out that there is no ketchup no mayonnaise no mustard no salads no vegetables that was supposed to be separated from the schnitzel  baguette.
We called again in order to receive the rest of the order but instead of getting it we were surprised to find out that one of the owners I believe was talking to us in a very rude way saying: 
\"if you want the ketchup mayonnaise and mustard you need to pay another $20 for the delivery that they forgot to put in, and regarding the baguette with the vegetables that supposed to be separated he said that there is no vegetables (salad) supposed to be added to it...\"

It's so nervous that you're trying to keep kosher and the options are limited and you finding that people like them taking advantage on those people...

I know for sure that Genesis is out of the question of where we going to eat at....
The food was average
The fries was wet, nothing was hot actually not even warm.. One of the begets that we asked not to have spicy came with spicy...

Strongly not recommended!!!!!

P.s
One of the workers said that the owner doesn't really care about the yelp page."}
