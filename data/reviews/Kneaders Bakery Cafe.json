{"text":"Normally this place is good, but NOT tonight!! The side salads were brown and slimy on the bottom. Took it back up there they had no more lettuce?? So we got soups. Then we got our sandwiches one was supposed to be a chicken pesto, there was no pesto on it, the other was a french dip and the au jus looked more like motor oil, and my husband said it tasted like sea water!. I asked to speak to the manager and she came to our table, I told her we didn't get the right sandwich as there was no pesto on it, and said yes that is the pesto chicken and the pesto must have melted?? No green anywhere on the sandwhich. The au jus she said was the last bit of it and so it is thicker?? She said \"sorry\" and walked away. This was my husbands first and last time there!! It looked like they were all too busy cleaning up for the night. Mind you it was about 7:15, and they don't close till 9pm.  Yuck! Yuck!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the positive. Amazing desserts and very tasty sandwiches.  Reason for 2 stars? The sandwich may be good, however the amount of meat and veggies they give you are VERY small. I've been a few times and the first two times it was plentiful. Now it's getting more scarce. 2 tiny pieces of turkey one micro piece of lettuce. Plenty of tomatoes and onion though!"}
{"text":"I love Kneaders, just not this one. Kneaders should fire the owner of this franchise immediately and save their good name. I was so excited when I saw that they were going to build this place!  We don't go anymore because we are tired of battling the staff to get all our order ( they forget something EVERY time). When the food is done right, it is Awesome! But, it's hit and miss..."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here, but I was pheening for my favorite salad!   I put in a lunch order for a group of 6 . We had 2 famous Clubs, 3 avocado bacon sandwiches and a chicken ala mondo salad. parmesan chips, loaded baked potato soup, pickle, broccoli salad, deli salad, éclair, and 4 different drinks. And our order was exactly correct and everyone's food was amazing.  Although I have been here before and understand the lunch rush, I pick up about 10 minutes late and everything is ready ;)  The staff is so exceptionally nice as always! The parmesan chips are really delicious and homemade and the éclair is ridiculous! I wish I would have ordered more of them to take home!!"}
{"text":"This was not a good experience.  The menu on the wall was very sparse (ie: no descriptions of what any of the food was), and when I asked the woman at the register what was in a sandwich, she had trouble telling me.  I also inquired about what kind of cheese was in a soup and whether or not it was pasteurized (I'm pregnant) and was told that it was not, even though I've literally never heard of Jack and cheddar cheese being unpasteurized unless it's right off the farm.  Furthermore, we waited in line forever (I think due to the fact that the menu didn't offer much help and there being only one register open during lunch (and the slow service at the register).  I ordered a panini and a soup and it took longer than you'd think to get my food.  The soup was fine, but the panini was a huge disappointment.  It had hardly any flavor and although I had asked for a different kind of bread, the sandwich came out with the bread it was originally on.  For nearly $9, the sandwich left much to be desired.  Lastly, the ambiance was poor.  You can see into the kitchen and, while clean looking, was messy.  The food came out w/o untensils (even though we were dining in and I ordered soup), which was surprising to me.  Overall, I would not recommend Kneaders and certainly will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I just had a change of heart about Kneaders this morning. This is the second time I had an issue with customer service. I've been ignored once again by a staff. I just need a take out box for my pastry. I said \"excuse me\" many times and I am totally being ignore on the counter. The lady keeps on walking in front of me. Then when she finally got into me, she gave the nasty look: \"do not disturb me\" look. That was a turn-off for me. I will never go back to Kneaders anymore.  Will just order take out next time again i guess or I will try a different location. All staff looks so tired early in the morning here."}
{"text":"So good, had a breakfast sandwich and a chai tea latte, it hit the spot!! These places are so cozy and cute inside!"}
{"text":"Do not go on Veterans Day! They do not recognize the holiday !!! Rude !"}
{"text":"Went in at lunch time to order some bread and brownies to go and maybe some lunch. Its so confusing and helter skeltered that we only ordered the bread and brownies. Customers were getting very upset that it is taking 35 minutes to get their order. I can just imagine if we ordered some sandwiches. It took 22 minutes just to get to put order in. Great concept but kneads some consultation and direction. Very disappointing everytime we go in or order food to go. Something is always wrong with our order."}
{"text":"I took the citrus chicken salad to go. The salad was huge. I had half for dinner and the other half for lunch the next day. I thought the wait time was just right for my freshly made meal. The line of customers was steady and everyone seemed happy. The interior is clean and bright."}
{"text":"I'm really big on Customer Service & it's horrible at this location. Plus it takes forever to get your food. I do agree with others about price vs quality of food  a lil high priced for what you get."}
{"text":"If you appreciate prompt service then avoid this restaurant!! Order placed @ 1058 for carry out. Yes, it was very busy since it was Saturday morning. My Mother and I didn't understand why there were so many rude and irritated customers. Well, 30 after waiting, order was inquired about and was told 10 min. 20 min extra of waiting puts ticket time at 45 min. (2 sandwiches and French toast). Told the manager to cancel the order but was assured was coming right up.  While observing others, our order was given to another table. The staff is made of teenagers with no real leadership. Plenty of laughing, poking, pushing and joking happening while customers are watching and becoming angry.  Food was good but didn't really care after all that"}
{"text":"The Turkey Bacon Avocado on Hazelnut bread is my family's go-to. It NEVER seems to get old. We've only been disappointed a couple times when we were given what seemed like the ends of a small loaf. 9/10 times the sandwiches are quite substantial (with lots of turkey chunks and thick crunchy bacon).  Desserts are pretty great - the cannoli's are amazing and so are their cheesecakes. I have to admit there HAS been a couple of times the slices tasted freezer-burnt, but that's just been 2 times out of 20 or so visits in the past year. That can happen anywhere.   Overall, I give this Kneaders 4 stars. 5-stars the day they make their drive through system more efficient. In our experience, if there are 2 cars ahead of you, it can take a solid 20-30 minutes."}
{"text":"We were curious to check out this new restaurant, but it was disappointing from the start. From the doorway in, everything was dirty. Rugs were misplaced across the floor at angles. Including us, the restaurant was about 90% empty, yet the staff just meandered around the kitchen. We ordered bakery items, and then realized every table was dirty. This is not professionally operated! They will need a good manager to turn things around."}
{"text":"Heard so many good things about this place. So my husband and I decided to try it out. We both got the turkey, bacon, avocado sandwich. Asked the girl what was on it and she gave my husband the worst attitude when we asked her! So we proceed our order and she told us our total, when she handed our card back she literally almost threw it at him!   Just for that we will not be returning! On the other note the sandwiches were okay, maybe it was just the experience that ruined it.   Will visit other locations next time!"}
{"text":"First time going to kneaders today and decided to go with the turkey bacon avocado on focaccia. Super bomb. Turkey wasn't dry and the kneaders sauce was really tasty! Definitely will be going back to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"This is an AMAZING place...I love love love the food...best sandwich for the money I've ever had.  My favorite is the Turkey Bacon Avocado on whole wheat, which is TWICE THE SIZE of Paradise Bakery's! Fresh, FREE BREAD SAMPLES while you wait, what more could you ask for?  I will say that the staff is not that polished, BUT--they fix anything they messed up quickly (like taking off tomato when I asked for no tomato).  I will not go back to Paradise or Corner Bakery ever again unless a gun is put to my head, lol.  Seriously, the most food for your money, people!"}
{"text":"This place is very consistently tasty and fresh. Sandwiches, salads, soup or baked goods: it's all been quality. It doesn't seem to matter whether I visit at brunch or in the evening, the pastries are never stale. Staff is polite and effective. Glad to have something so fresh, delicious and (relatively) cheap so close to home."}
{"text":"We waited forever for a tiny cup of Oatmeal that was outrageously expensive.   Why is this place busy, I don't get it"}
{"text":"Roasted Pepper Gouda Soup is the BEST! So far I have like every soup I have had from that but that soup was the only one that left me sad when the bowl was empty lol. I always get the Turkey Cranberry Croissant sandwich. I haven't ventured out into other sandwiches because I'm afraid I won't like it and end up kicking myself for not getting what I know I like."}
{"text":"This location is superb! Very clean and the employees are super friendly. I love the assortment of baked goods and handcrafted things there are to buy in the shop. While I was here I ordered a chicken and artichoke panini on focaccia bread. It was AMAZING! Not only are they amazing at lunch and dinner items, I've sampled their breakfast and you can't go wrong! Everything here is delectable."}
{"text":"dissapointed  16 bucks for a Greek scramble and pecan pancakes,  2 coffees  Scramble was over cooked, portion was probably a cup?  Customer service failed to tell me about \"all you can eat French toast and pancakes\" Also failed to inform me of loyalty card  I had to read these things on signs they had hanging"}
{"text":"First time here with my coworkers, and OH MY! we love it.  Their costumer service is awesome, and Gino the owner was very nice, and made us feel like home.  I'm definitely coming back, and bringing more people. Hopefully they open another location in the east side closer to home."}
{"text":"I loved this Kneaders when we first came to try it out. They had huge portions of meat on their sandwiches, and their fresh bread is delicious.  I got the turkey, bacon, and avocado on focaccia and my boyfriend got the French dip on a baguette.   They were absolutely delicious, with crunchy lettuce on mine, and a huge portion of roast beef on his. We liked it so much we went the next weekend, as well.  We have not had a similar experience since. I have not ever had an order made correctly since our first visit, and their meat portions seem to be shrinking. Whether it is chicken noodle instead of cream of broccoli soup, missing the au jus for a French dip, or putting extra sauce when we asked for none... the inconsistency is endless. It takes ten minutes to go through the drive thru.   I'd like to say I'll be back, but I probably will cross this Kneaders off the list and go to Jimmy John's across the parking lot."}
{"text":"The French toast was delicious, but the omelette was pathetic. It was more of a breakfast scramble. First of all the Mexican omelette doesn't even have meat, so I ordered the American and it was basically scrambled eggs with a few small pieces of broccoli and 4 small pieces of ham and shredded cheese sprinkle on it. No taste, had to add ketchup. It was seriously the saddest omelette ever and I didn't even finish it. Waste of money, but like I said the French toast was delicious. I don't think we will be back unless we have a serious French toast craving."}
{"text":"I can't get enough kneaders! Their salads are amazing, I generally don't like turkey but the turkey on their avocado turkey salad is always moist and amazing. And the side of bread they put on the side... Amazeballs! Nom nom noms"}
{"text":"Service was very good and quick. The food was amazing especially there breakfast! The inside was very clean and put together. They had children's highchair and special kids ups and it comes with a toy! Very family friend place to eat. My boyfriend had a sandwich which he said was very good and my son had a grilled cheese which was very good. The staff were very friendly and nice and helped with any questions we had."}
{"text":"Hello, I read all the bad experience with the Cust Serv or Cashier, so far I didn't get any smack from any of them LOL. Well, I got me a Chicken Panini Artichoke something sandwich that was really good and the Chicken Enchilada soup. I was my first time there ,I like the atmosphere and just less than 7 min from my home. I just hope to keep the good Cashier service."}
{"text":"This will be my last time coming here...I've been here a handful of times and each time the service is always slow. I came here for a sandwich so I ordered the Cafe Sandwich on Croissant with no onions. When I got my order 10 minutes later I was standing in line to buy a Mother's Day cake on sale. I looked at my sandwich and realized it was on sourdough bread. I then asked the lady \"isn't this supposed to he on a cross isn't, considering it says that on the menu\". She then proceeds to say \"ya, did you want a croissant\". Not a sorry, nothing. I said \"can you just give me a croissant because I don't have time to wait for you guys\". Then I waited another 7 minutes just to get my cake boxed. The service was slow, the employees looked miserable and weren't friendly at all, and the customer service here sucks! If you're going to get an order wrong, the least you can do is apologize. Not worth it."}
{"text":"YUMMMM for delicious salads available in a DRIVE THROUGH! Seriously, this is my dream -- I absolutely loved their Thai Chicken Salad. It was super fresh, made to order, packaged appropriately, and absolutely delicious. Super bonus points for not making me unpack my kids and go inside to get it - healthy dinner for the win!"}
{"text":"This place is the cutest! Love their little basket boutique shop and everything on the Menu. This was my first time here and the manager made sure I felt welcomed, the staff described some menu options and even offered me some samples. I had the Avocado Bacon Sandwich and Tomato Basil soup and the sandwich was huge! Overflowing of fresh pulled turkey and lots of avocado! This place also has a boutique set up to make gift baskets with fresh baked goods, home décor, jewelry and lots of other goodies. Great to come with a group or to stop and grab a quick gift for someone special. I loved my experience here and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"OMG! The cinnamon french toast is amazing! This cafe is super cute on the inside and all of the pastries, drinks, sandwiches, etc. have all been delicious!"}
{"text":"The bread here is out of this world and so are the pastries, this is not fast food so it takes a few minutes.  The staff is young but helpful  Ok all the food here is fresh and yummy  But the bread is king here."}
{"text":"I have never had a need to use yelp before, but I decided to create an account today so I could write this specific review. My husband and I decided to try this restaurant tonight for the first time. We noticed they had a drive thru, which was convenient since we had our two little ones in the car. After ordering, we had to wait 15 minutes for our food, having multiple employees come to the window asking \"what we were waiting for.\" One even tried to give us our drink again. Upon receiving our food, we were very disappointed. I ordered the portobello panini. I was upset to find that it LITERALLY had 6 tiny pieces of vegetables on it, most of which were onions(I took pictures). They also forgot the chips that were supposed to come with the meal. My husband ordered a turkey bacon avocado salad. It had two small bites of turkey and a chip of bacon. Not even a full piece of bacon. We do not plan to eat at this restaurant again, but I just wanted them to be aware of our experience so that maybe it can be better for someone else in the future. Also, considering the food alone, the price is a bit steep."}
{"text":"First time at Kneaders.  I don't know their background or history but walking in is like a mixture of Cracker Barrel (for all the random items that they sell) and Panera.  It wasn't busy when we arrived to have breakfast so it gave us time to look at the menu.  I decided on getting the Chunky Cinnamon French Toast.  It's good but really thick so if you like that then this is for you!  I also ordered an oatmeal with fruit which was OK.  Nothing special.  The items are a bit overpriced for the amount of food that you receive.  I may come back to try some of their bakery items but will go through the drive-thru next time.  Giving it 3-stars for the drive-thru option and great customer service.  Oh!  And they're closed on Sundays, if anyone was wondering!"}
{"text":"My work ordered this for our month end dinner, and it's amazing. The sandwiches are huge and worth the price. I got a turkey bacon on focaccia bread. Literally the best sandwich I've ever had."}
{"text":"The French dip here taste pretty damn goods and it of a decent size just wish they would put a little more meat"}
{"text":"We went with another family who got their order and we were still waiting 10 minutes later.  It seemed like they just forgot about us or something but they were quick to apologize and even gave us a couple of free cookies, which were delicious.  The sandwiches are pretty big portions in my opinion.  Next time the hubs and I will probably share one.  I wish they had half orders.  Decent service, yummy food and cute décor inside."}
{"text":"Healthy delicious sandwich. Gino (Eugene) worked super hard and had a smile on his face the whole time. Take cash to tip the staff as the credit card payment doesn't offer to add tip."}
{"text":"Had the Roasted Pepper Gouda Soup and it was very good!  I will buy that again!  Their bread is also great. We also ate the mini fruit tart and raspberry cheesecake.  They were both good, but I'd stick to Albertsons 13' fruit tart for $13.  I like the place, but won't go out of my way to get here. Could use an amp in customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped for my first time with friends.  There where 7 employees no coffee was ready.  What was in machine was cold.  They where out of coffee beans.  The employees where oblivious to customer service."}
{"text":"Awesome food- great service- home-y environment! My BLT was delicious and came or quickly. I did wish the bread was toasted- but I'll ask for it that way next time! I love the cute little shopping portion of the restaurant and how it really feels like home."}
{"text":"Just OK. Average prices, average customer service,  average portion. Ordered a pastrami sandwich, which looked, tasted like deli meat from the grocery store. On a brighter side, the key lime tart was delicious.  This may be a once-a-year destination."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Friendly service, as always. The food was good. I was glad to see other options for kids meal besides fries."}
{"text":"Been trying to give this place the benefit of doubt, but I cant lose my Integrity. 1 Star is too much. Since day one, my wife and I have tried to like this place. Love the bread. The operations is confusing. Where to order food and where to get just bakery items. Service is supposed to be the main factor,   its not. You could have better service if had a line for food and line for bakery. Since you don't, you upset the customer. Place is confusing. I have gone to drive thru several times and funny thing is, at around noon, which should be a very busy time, there were no cars in line. I placed my order and they were out of Cinnamon Rolls at 11:54 am. I then ordered the Country White bread which I really enjoy. I made sure I said Country White bread again since my order was screwed up last time I was there. When I got home, Surprise, it was Sourdough, again incorrect.  I could go on forever. It was a Manager who served me. Never will I buy anything from this restaurant again. So disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Girl at the register was sweet and was welcoming when we walked in, we spent a little time figuring out what we wanted and she was very nice about it. We ended up getting sandwiches, pastries, and a couple loafs of their pumpkin bread. I'm not exaggerating when I say they were all fresh and incredible tasting. I didnt get a chance to try a coffee drink but I will definitely be back in to do so. Also they had holiday decorations up and it just felt very warm and welcome."}
{"text":"The food portions are quite large so it's nice to have leftovers or order a half sandwich and soup. I had a turkey sandwich on their fresh baked bread and it was great! The only suggestion I have is that they put more jam on it or extra on the side as it was a bit dry. The dessert case was incredibly delicious looking so I had to order a cheesecake brownie and it was worth the calories! Absolutely incredible tasting! The ambiance reminded me of a country store in Wisconsin. It was really cute and cozy!"}
{"text":"It has become apparent that this chain uses refrigerated bagged chicken from some company (Shamrock?) that is just nasty, fatty and slimy. The chicken on the full size Chicken Chop salad was approaching miserable at best today. At 9 bucks, this place should be grilling their own chicken and then using that throughout the day on the salads. You can;t expect much from a chain, so I suppose my other good meals here have now been wiped out. The chicken wasn't fit for human consumption today and how can a chopped salad be ready in 30 seconds at the drive through? McDonald;s does that, this place should be ashamed."}
{"text":"I buy my bread here and it has really good prices for loaves.. I love that this cafe has a drive thru, so if I am in a hurry but still want something that is fresh and has good quality ingredients this is the place that I go too... one time I got a cheesecake and the berries on it were squished a little which is not a big deal at all, but the lady who made my order said that the owner put a free cheesecake in there, just because the other one didn't look as nice, they both tasted great and what great customer service!"}
{"text":"Over priced. I had the turkey bacon avocado salad. It had about 2 oz of dry turkey, about a tablespoon of bacon, 3 maybe 4 very small slices of avocado 3 cherry tomatoes, 3 cucumber slices and a pile of straight from the bag lettuce. $8 for this???? On a positive note , the cashier was pleasant  to everyone in the rather long line. Paradise Bakery is a better choice for this kind of food."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Kneaders, but came away very disappointed.  I ordered the Large  Green Avocado salad- the salad was incredibly small and skimpy on the lettuce. The focaccia bread I ordered alongside was bland. My husband ordered the French Dip- it was lots of bread and very little meat. My son got the kids PB&J sandwich- which apparently is served on sourdough bread. We sent that back as it was disgusting. My daughter ordered the kids chicken noodle soup, which was not bad.   The service was mediocre but they did remake my sons sandwich on honey wheat bread which was a little better.   We did not try the pastries and I doubt we will come back to do so."}
{"text":"Not bad! Clean atmosphere, ordered the chicken pesto sandwich and it was delicious! Their coffee is ok and red velvet cupcake was ok as well, didn't impress me but it was still edible. But it's a nice place to sit down, relax, and talk to a friend."}
{"text":"Food was great. Customer service has declined since Geno & Michael  left or moved to other locations.Today my family had breakfast at Avondale location,and saw poor display of management/customer service you could witness. Manager made cashier cry. I don't really think the issue was significant enough to display, so customers can witness. Manager brought out food and never even acknowledged us. Don't think he's a bad guy just needs training. If you can't take heat stay out of kitchen."}
{"text":"I had breakfast at Kneaders the other day for the first time and I was completely amazed! When I first walked in, I was greeted by a warm and welcoming environment. Not only did they allow me to try samples (all were very delicious), but I was also educated on what they had to offer. I chose the French toast (which is unlimited by the way!) and it was absolutely great. I definitely will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Picked up dinner to go. Order 2 bacon avocado turkey salad full size on both. As I began to eat the salad I noticed there NO avocado anywhere on the salad. Very disappointed. The turkey and bacon had a great taste but what was missing was the avocado to hit the spot. Loved the inside set up and the cashier was very nice and polite. Will def return nd next time order half the size as it was too much to finish and make sure my avocado is in the salad.... Sad.."}
{"text":"You definitely get a feel of \"grandma's house\" upon entering, which is on purpose. The staff was polite. Although it's a little disorienting at first because the menu is pretty long. We went for some pie, but they didn't have any pie out because something was wrong with the cooler. Anyways, it took a little bit to figure out what kind of pies they had.....there wasn't really a menu; just some signs that were left in the cooler.   Pies tasted good. They were so rich, we couldn't finish them and brought them home. Coffee was not hot, but barely warm. To be fair, it was at dinner time so the coffee was probably sitting out for a while.....maybe all day.   If you're wondering if this is a good place to study or use your computer, it probably is if you have a full battery. I scoped out the place and they didn't have one outlet next to any of the tables. Places like Panera Bread has outlets everywhere, but this place did not.  Overall, it was a pretty good experience. Might return for some more pie!"}
{"text":"First time here person taking the order not helpful at all. No personality.  Ordered Rubin sandwich (tasted good) it came with chips that were stale. Tables were dirty. Don't know if I'll give it another chance."}
{"text":"What a way to start my day!!  I wish I would have gotten the name of the gentleman who helped me on July 6th at 7:00 AM. He was so kind and pleasant.  He made amazing suggestions (I was feeding an office breakfast).  He carried everything to my car and even opened my car door for me.  It was a perfect start to my day and I will think of them again when it is time to treat my offices."}
{"text":"Tried for first time. Guy in the drive through had a filthy apron on and his hands were also dirty. I got the Mexican omelette. It's was disgusting. Instead of Pico De Gallo it had raw bell peppers and it was supposed to come with crema and had none. Wheat toast tasted funky and was not toasted at all. Fresh orange slices were gross and had been soaked in the omelette water. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"This is a bakery/sandwich and soup salad place. The food is okay, I wouldn't run here just for a sandwich but I gave the 3 stars for the delicious cauliflower cheese soup! That was my favorite part of the whole experience. I didn't even care for the ice tea it wasn't like Panera where you have lots of choices of different teas. Happy Eats!!!"}
{"text":"Younger tall man with Braces was very nice and very polite. We came for the French toast and after 11 a.m I asked to get another one which I thought I had to pay and he said it was free and spoke with the chef to get it out fast. He has great service skills and great people skills."}
{"text":"Kneaders is SO good! We recently visited some family in Phoenix and ended up eating here twice!   I can't comment on their lunch items, but the cinnamon french toast is absolutely amazing! It is all you can eat from 7-11am but no one in our group could eat more than the 2 huge slices that they give you. The syrup is very buttery and good. It was a little less than $6 for the french toast.   The restaurant is new and set up very cute. They also have outdoor seating available.  They are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"I RAVED about this place to everyone who was within ear-shot when it opened.  I typically would go about once a week and get a sandwich combo and a kid's meal for my little one who was always with me (and why I always choose the drive through).  Pros: The turkey.  The tuna is also good (which I got via an incorrect order...see cons below)  Cons:  This place cannot get an order correct to save their lives.  I order a plain PLAIN turkey sandwich on a croissant and I get a salad, smoothie, incorrect sandwich, kids meal... it has literally been incorrect or unacceptable in some way the last 5 out of 7 times I've been there.  The staff seem like they would rather be ANYWHERE but there most of the time.  The drive through window attendant took my order once (I was the only car in line, ordered plain turkey sandwich).  I watched him take out the trash and have a smoke while I sat...starting to fume...in the drive through line.  He walked back in and apologized profusely for the delay (which was not his fault) but after all that, they handed me a salad.  Literally 20 minutes in line by myself at the drive through for a plain sandwich and they hand me a pre-packaged SALAD?!  I would call each time my order was incorrect (or correct it at the window) but it's not worth it to have this happen nearly every time I eat there.  Panera is right across the street and MUCH better overall.  I've tried again and again to give them more chances.  Last visit was last week. I ordered a $9 plain turkey sandwich and drink combo.  I got home to find my order was correct but placed on a nearly inedible croissant that was about the size of my palm.  My 3 year old at the entire contents of the sandwich and was still hungry, so totally unacceptable product.  Horrible service.  On the off chance they get an order correct, you may be eating a small bread brick.  I just give up and suggest that others don't bother...at least with the drive through."}
{"text":"Sasha has an attitude with customers. She is actually flat out disrespectful. While ordering a ham and cheese sandwich I asked if I could get it hot and she rolled her eyes at me. When I was getting the coffee they were out of regular so I had to ask for them to make more and she was slamming doors and huffing and puffing the whole time. My other relative had the decaf which was available but cold. There was no creamer out so we had to ask for half and half. Thats when she started snickering and rolling her eyes looking over at us while chatting with a fellow employee chrissy, christine or something similar to that name. After waiting for about 15 min I actually had to ask the other woman christine if the coffee was ever going to come out. She then brought it out but they were out of half and half and put a carton of milk out near the station. I then realized that they never gave a fork for my relatives strawberry cake. Had to go get one and again was treated like a piece of crap and that they didnt value their job, in fact acted like it was the worst place to be. The ham sandwich I got was so drenched in the sauce that I took only a few bites and brought it home for my dogs. They both were hunched over, dragging their feet, sighing, rolling their eyes and talking about customers then staring. When we got there we were only the second people there. The place was empty . After a while more people came in but the service was the worst I have ever experienced. None of my other reviews on yelp even come close to this one. I will be emailing corporate. Oh. P.s. wanted to mention that a few boys came in and the girls perked right up, smiled and treated them great. I guess they wanted to look good for the boys."}
{"text":"First I will say that we will never go back. We orderd Rueben sandwiches.  The only good thing was the bread.  I think that they forgot to use pastrami.  It was clearly roast beef.  There is NO mistaking the diffeernce between the two.  In a whole sandwich, there was one very thin layer of meat that did not even cover the whole sandwich.  They forgot to bring out the \"parmesan\" chips.  They finally brought out soggy, tasteless chips  There was absolutely no trace of parmesan anywhere.  ALL of the tables were dirty.  I went and asked if someone could come and clean some tables.  The guy was washing tables and chairs using the same filthy rag.  nasty nasty   As I said, NEVER again going to Kneaders.  There are too many other good sandwich shops."}
{"text":"After a night out in Old Town Scottsdale, I needed to start the Recovery process. Instead of the location on Indian School Rd by 41st Street, I opted to go to one a little closer to home in Avondale. For those whom may not know, Kneaders does serve breakfast - including All-You-Can-Eat Sourdough pancakes as well as Cinnamon French Toast (dine-in only). They serve them hot & fresh every time, with each serving tastier than the next! The staff here are cheerful and quick when it comes to serving you, if dining in. They also have delish looking sandwiches and the best eclairs in Avondale!  I had the pancakes, which had a slight crust on it, but still fluffy & tender on the inside. They serve the first plate with strawberries & creme, as well as warm syrup. This isn't Aunt Jemima nuked in the microwave, neither. The syrup I had was a lovely butter-centric flavoured syrup, which ribbons across your pancakes or French Toast..  This would be a great place for a quiet neighbourhood brunch on Saturdays (Closed on Sundays, as is all their locations =( ), or getting fresh bread, pastries, etc."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and for the most part, everything is really great. Except for the online ordering.   It is a very busy restaurant at lunchtime so I order ahead online -- and usually all I'm having is a bowl of soup with a roll, but it never fails that when I get there, either at or past my pickup time, no one has even looked at my order yet. I have had to wait a half hour past my pickup time for a couple of salads and in turn missed my entire lunch break. We had to just put them in the fridge at work and eat it a few hours later.   The poor woman ahead of me had given them 2 hours notice for about 8 meals for her higher-ups who were having an all-day meeting, but she had to stand there and wait 30 min for them to finish her order. She was freaking out, and rightfully so. It was pretty obvious to me they had never even seen her ticket until she showed up!  A half hour notice is plenty of time to spoon soup into a bowl... Why am I waiting 10-15 min past that time when I get there?"}
{"text":"This place has terrible service and it takes them forever to push orders out . This was the second time I struck out here and the last . The first time we waited  15 minutes  for pastries  that are already made all they had to do is put them in boxes  , it seems that the back staff does all the order pulling so after I ordered I waited and waited while the cashier just stood there . The second time  was the same but this time I said something  but I still managed to get out around the same time 16 minutes  . I haven't tried anything they cook to order  just the pastries which are ok except the connoli's which were  soggy."}
{"text":"Had a club sandwich and it was $7.99, no sides or chips or anything.  Thought it was expensive.  Made my stomach upset."}
{"text":"Visited this Kneaders this morning for a quick bite before a long day. I got the French toast with a cup of coffee to go and it was delicious ! It was ready so fast and the employees were super friendly. Love Kneaders"}
{"text":"I usually only use their drive thru since it's convenient with an infant and a kindergartener, but last Saturday I decided to dine in for the first time; That the worst choice I could have made that day.  Took 15 minutes to even place an order at the register. The Line only had 3 parties ahead of me... What gives? Then I place my order and sit down. The woman running the food was very difficult to hear as she paced the dining room calling a name on the order, most people looked puzzled at her.  I waited another 15 minutes for a Caesar salad, a muffin top, and a side of fruit.  Then I received my salad with RANCH dressing. So, I advised the front and they took my salad claiming they'd get me a new one quickly... NOT! 20 minutes later I have a new salad with the correct dressing.  In all, I waited 50-60 minutes just to start eating A SALAD!!! Not an \"I'm sorry\" or even a reimbursement was offered by the kids running the place.   I will NEVER dine at this establishment again and I will be sure to take back all my positive stories I have shared with others!"}
{"text":"Nice little place to have a tasty dinne. Chicken noodle soup is really good 5 stars Potato soup was not very good it taste like spoiled milk with cheese. It has a funny smell too."}
{"text":"What a Disappointment! I came in after the morning rush, at about 9:30, and on a Wednesday. Brittany is by far the worst cashier I've ever witnessed. It would have been like pulling teeth to get a good morning greeting or even a smile. Every question was an inconvenience to answer. She moved at a snails pace and yet made it seem as though you taking a minute to glance at the menu was keeping her standing next to her register too long. Another women had made a big order to go and as she waited she must have had the same experience. As she waited she called the manager and gave some advice on customer service and examples of her unsatisfactory service she just received.  The same girl Brittany had given the lady her to-go order and the women asked if the bread was in the bag. Brittany didn't answer nor did she look or assist to find out. The lady said nevermind I'll grab it myself. As soon as the woman left all the staff including the manager were laughing at the phone call. All of the staff look too young to take the job seriously, including the manager. They need to fire everyone and hire new people who understand the value of a job. I'll never come back. Save yourself the bad customer service and go to Paradise Bakery across the street."}
{"text":"Horrible service today. The cashier did not know what she was doing. I ordered a Thai salad that is made with cashews, it had slivered almonds on it, when I asked why they first asked if I wanted something different then told me they were out of cashews since last week. So I ordered a different salad that is supposed to come with bread, another 5 minute wait. Then we go to throw away our trash, low and behold the trash can is literally over flowing. And it wasn't even that packed. Today wasn't about the food or the place but the lack of management and workers that actually care about their job. What a horrible first experience"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this new place but have been here twice and that was once too many!  Service is horrible.  Both times they messed up the order and never got it fixed until we got irritated and asked when they were bringing the right part of the order.  The sandwiches are pathetic.  No filling and nothing to even make them tasty.  If you want a good lunch, go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Nice Breakfast  As you walk in to Kneaders Bakery and Cafe you can't help but notice the glass cases of delicious looking desserts immediately upon entering the restaurant.  This was my first visit to Kneaders but it won't be my last.  The restaurant is clean, comfortable and has many tasty options to choose from. On this visit I ordered the Chunky Cinnamon Bread French Toast for breakfast; what could be more delicious and satisfying?    The cinnamon bread french toast is served with  warm caramel sauce, whipped butter, and sliced strawberries.  I have to admit my breakfasts perfectly delicious, very filling, however I ate it all.  Come to Kneaders hungry, and leave happy!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Fast to get my yummy breakfast and I love all the options they have!  And a drive thru is a must when I bring my gang."}
{"text":"I had a craving for something sweet so I looked up bakeries and Kneaders came up so I decided to give it a shot. I ordered a cannoli and a fruit tart (I'm a college student studying, I need brain food hahahaha). I used the online ordering and stated my pick up time would be 7:45 pm. When I got there it was pretty quiet and my order was ready, I picked it up in the drive thru window which was really convenient. The fruit tart had really fresh fruit on top and a delicious cream cheese type of filling, just delicious and it was pretty too!! The cannoli I bought was some type of orange-lemon citrus cannoli and was delicious as well, sweet but also refreshing without being overdone. I believe the tart was $2 and the cannoli was about $2.50, making my total $5.38. Both treats were a pretty good size without being too much and I thought it was a great price for something so delicious, pretty, and nicely sized. I'll have to make Kneaders my go to spot for my sweet tooth cravings, I will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Had no idea they also had breakfast entrees. The croissant was good, staff are friendly and service was quick."}
{"text":"Really cute place! Friendly staff. The line moved very quick for being busy. The cashier was friendly and knowledgeable about ordering cakes. He was very patient. The cake we order was the smallest 3 tiered  pineapple coconut with whipped cream frosting instead of regular frosting. So delicious."}
{"text":"Came by for a morning snack. This place is so cute. They have a lot of cute items for sale and they also have baskets !!! Real cute!!  I got a coconut scone and it was delicious. . My grandson got. Kids meal with grilled cheese, grapes, chocolate milk and a delicious shamrock sugar cookie. . Everything is reasonably priced too!!     I think what was the cherry on top was the cashier he was super nice and took the time and patience to answer all our questions and give us suggestions on what to get. Kudos to Anthony for his excellent customer service. I will definitely be back again and hope Anthony is here to answer my questions.  Oh I almost forgot, they give military discount too !!"}
{"text":"They ran out of the Harvest Ingredients for the Panini, they were slow, and the portions are small, not impressed.  The restaurant was clean so that is a plus, but the staff doesn't understand the menu.  I ended up ordering the cranberry turkey which is good, but the size doesnt match the price."}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere. Great service and cute aprons to purchase. Son loves the chicken soup. I like the croissant chicken salad sandwich. The turkey croissant wasn't bad either. Plenty of seats and the place was clean. Yes it obviously takes a piece of the whole paradise bakery and Panera bread and wildflower genre. But it's nice to have another place to go to. The cheesecake is to die for."}
{"text":"Okay, I have seen this place for so long and never wanted to stop by. From the outside during the day, I just did not think it appeared inviting and had no idea what kind of food they served. Today though I was getting new tires on at Discount Tire and figure oh what the heck. Boy was I glad I did. As soon as I walked in and saw the large glass case of desserts I knew I should have visited this place a long time ago and I should not have judged a book by the cover. So I being a new customer, walked up to the counter as the friendly staff what I should order and she mentioned the chunk French toast. She then proceeded to tell me that it was all I could eat. I thought for sure I heard her wrong, as the price was only $6.00. Nope, I heard her right and she brought me two slices of warm thick French toast with caramel sauce and strawberries with whip cream. Yep, all for six bucks. I sat back and devoured it and was stuffed. But again, it was all you can eat and felt required to have one more slice, which I did. The meal was great and the price point amazing. I highly recommend the meal but be aware it is only Monday-Friday I believe.  I enjoyed the meal so much that ai brought my wife back for dinner the next day. Our dinner meals were tasty but packed in comparison the breakfast. I will add though that after dinner we had what I believe was a raspberry cheesecake and it was great. Overall, will visit again for sure and my next business meeting will be at Kneaders for breakfast:)"}
{"text":"This location was not near as good as the food I've had at Kneaders off of Bell.  My Turkey and Avacado sandwich was very dry and the soup sample was boiling hot and I totally burnt my tongue even after blowing on it for quite some time.  I will never go back to this location :/  I actually crave their food, I love their food but this just goes to show the locations vary on taste!"}
{"text":"I am giving them 2 stars because our office orders online several days a week. We place 3 to 8 orders at a time. Most days 75% of the orders show up wrong. The orders are missing items we paid for or they don't have time correct items as ordered. They could use some work on there attention to details on take out orders.  The food I would give then 5 stars. Always fresh and well prepared, that is the only reason we keep ordering from them."}
{"text":"I ordered a tuna salad on hazelnut bread sandwich to go and added a cup of cream of broccoli soup.  The tuna salad was good and the bread was delicious but the sandwich was a mess.  They used very little tuna salad, a piece of lettuce with a large spine and bread that was so thinly sliced  when I picked half up it fell apart.  I had to eat the sandwich with a fork.  The sandwich appeared to be a nice size sandwich for $7.00 but when you consider the thinness of the bread and the lack of much filling, it was overpriced.  The soup was good enough."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Ate here 3 days in a row for breakfast because of work meetings. By day 2 they knew my name and were so welcoming and friendly. I highly recommend the French Toast. I will be here every time I visit Phoenix from now on! Thank you Kneaders!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner the staff was friendly the place was very nice and cozy. I had ordered the turkey avacado sandwich. Chicken noodle soup and a red velvet small bundt cake. I must say everything was really good and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The pastries are delicious but the customer service isn't very good. They weren't very friendly and they kept us waiting so long for our order, to discover they actually forgot about us. When we asked, they handed us the bag. They weren't busy either."}
{"text":"The store is really nice inside, they got all kinds go cute stuff to buy and also sell all of these cute pastries. I ordered an omelet for breakfast it was delicious, maybe too much butter on the bread. Love the orange slices. I had a friendly person at the registry. I will definitely come back !"}
{"text":"When i first went to the location i fell in love. The food is great and the prices are okay. I do have to say, with a heavy heart, the service is getting worst and worst. Im a huge fan of their soup in a sour dough bun.   So bottom line if you dont care much about service and want a yummy sandwich this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go and have lunch, the environment is great. I always get the chicken ala mondo salad. I don't know if they changed the chicken they were using, because, it definitely tastes different and I'm not really a fan of it.  Other than that I really like this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the things I read, I didn't come across anything but wonderful customer service. The food is great and fresh nice cute little place  Will be back soon. I got the turkey bacon avocado sandwich"}
{"text":"The idea of this place is great. The actual experience is not. Nice place, decor is pleasant, clean enough and good food. The problem is they seem to be greatly understaffed every time I visit. I have had decent people in terms of services, and a few that I felt could use more training. I always experience a long wait and sometimes a little frustration due to what seems to be a lack of training. The folks that seem to be the managers are always working, which I appreciate, there's just not enough people for what needs to be done. I don't know if this place will make it with their slow service and the competing, similar restaurants nearby.  Stopped in again a few times since my last review because I like a certain salad - last 3 times I've been here they are out of croutons. Appears \"they keep selling out\" - really? of croutons? Is there a mad dash for croutons that I don't know about? They were also out of chicken soup today - seems like an ordering problem and not so much \"sudden crouton popularity\". Oh and they were out of bags for carry out. Who is running this place and more importantly, who owns this place? Get off your butt and get in there to salvage the customer experience before it's too late."}
{"text":"I love their breakfast!! The french toast is my favorite but they have lots of options. I love the decorative items for sale, too. Inventory is always in season and rotated often. Whenever I think of eating breakfast out, Kneader's is the first place I think of.  Do breakfast at Kneader's!"}
{"text":"Saw a story on the news a couple nights ago about this chain and thought I'd give it a try. Ordered some sort of fruit danish for me and cinnamon roll for my husband. He liked the cinnamon roll. I found the danish to be production line bland and the dough extremely spongy. They're going for a target demographic here. I'm upper middle class Caucasian. It's not me.   For price and quality you're better off going to Daily Donut on Indian School."}
{"text":"I needed a quick bite to eat and I knew Kneaders would not let me down. I ordered their chunky cinnamon French toast and they were so good! Perfect amount of strawberries and their delicious caramel syrup. I ordered my food and as soon as I was going to sit down, my food was ready! If you're looking for a quick bite to eat, this is the spot."}
{"text":"I love this place or chain. I don't have the complaints like the other yelpers because I just come for the good coffee and pastry. Occasionally I will get a bread loaf. Service is always warm and friendly along with the manager saying hello."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time seeing this restaurant and gave it a shot because it was a healthier quick (even drive through) option in the west valley. We ordered the Citrus Salad, Veggie Avocado Sandwich, Asiago Soup, and Three Cheese Cauliflower Soup. The salad was ordered with no chicken, but when we got home noticed they did not leave the chicken off. The salad was offered with bread or croutons, and neither was in the bag when we took our food out. The sandwich was salty, but we were unable to determine where that came from. The Asiago had too strong of a distinct flavor. The cauliflower soup was probably the best item. For to-go orders, it's got to be right the first time. By the time people get home, it's too late to try and make it right. We'll most likely to continue eating at Paradise Bakery right across the street."}
{"text":"Love this place!Food is always fresh with lots of healthy options. Every time I visit I'm always get great customer service. The location is always clean and friendly."}
{"text":"While standing in line to order, my husband noticed the top of the bakery case was filthy. I reached up and dragged a finger across the top and greasy dust was all over. The line hadn't moved in several minutes - we walked out.   I tried This location last year and the line/order process was really slow back then. We were underwhelmed to ur it honestly."}
{"text":"Love their bread and bakery, reminds me of back home.  I have to also state Michael is so nice and helpful.   I will admit I have never had a meal there yet, but plan to very soon. The only thing I do not like is the long line when you go at peak times.  They could use another person taking orders, but the wait is not enough to lower my review to 4 stars"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Manager on duty didn't give a shit about what was going on. New service that takes your orders for them is a joke. Your telling me the store can't take to go orders. There that busy and can't do what every other place does. If your going to have a 3rd party take orders for you make sure they know what you have. Very disappointing and I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast all you can eat French toast! Came with my mom and daughter. Love they little nick nacks ans cute novelty items"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It almost feels hidden in plain sight. I've lived here for quite some time now and finally made my way into here. The food is great, service is great, adorable inside, and I was pleased to realize they have a drive-thru! Such a great place and they have lighter options too! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My co-worker and I just tried this place for the first time yesterday and were blown away by how amazing everything was. We told Michael that  we have never been there before and he gave us information on everything on the menu, ways to order to save money, their specials on their bread every Sunday, and about the ingredients they use. We were informed that everything is made fresh every morning, no preservatives!!! Our food tasted amazing, obviously the customer service was out of this world, and our office now has another location other than Chipotle to get fresh, healthy lunch options. I cannot say enough how pleased we were. HIGHLY recommend!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I hate this kneaders, I've been there on multiple occasions and I always swear I'll never come back. I drew the line yesterday when I ordered a cappuccino and a slice of cheesecake. It's a bakery so you would think they could do a decent job on these two items, the cappuccino tasted like sugar free creamer with no coffee in it while the cheesecake was nothing special, I could get something better frozen. I will never ever come back."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT eat here. I decided to go through the drive through at about 730 at night. The restaurant was slow inside so I figured I would get my food pretty quick. IT TOOK 30 MINUTES TO GET MY FOOD... AT A DRIVE THROUGH!!!!! The panini sandwich combo cost me $12.50 and it was so small it took me 2 minutes, if that, to eat. $12.50 and 30 minutes of my life gone to eat a mediocre sandwich that didn't even fill me up in the slightest. I'm making an omelet as I right this, infuriated. Oh and the teenagers that work there have ZERO customer service skills. \"You can leave, the straws in the bag.\""}
{"text":"I am so disappointed at Kneaders that I doubt I would ever go back.  We walked in late one night, only about 2 couples waiting for their food. We only ordered some pastries to go.  they said it would only take a minute. we sat down and 10 min went by.  being an understanding person I decided to give them another few minutes.  there 5 workerz, no sign of a manager and I could hear them laughing and talking behind the line.  I asked the kid on the register for our pastries (its been approx 20 min by now).  keep in mind this pastries are already made! all they gotta do is put it in a box and hand it over. well, no. after 20 min we told the kid on the register how much longer, and he said it was coming right up. wrong again, took another 5 minutes before they were ready. the only reason we didnt leave is that we had already paid, and i feared never getting refund if we asked for one. we have decided that no matter how good the pastries are, the service has been horrible the last three visits and we WILL NOT be going back."}
{"text":"Pros: The Restaurant is clean. As long as they don't keep the gloves on after touching the money then my food.  I remind them from time to time don't worry. (It happens often) they also have great Turkey!    Cons: My order is seldom correct and I usually spend $40 a visit. No Onion and cheddar instead of Swiss should be a lot easier to consistently execute. Panera is across the street and I will be trying it today. Hoping they execute No Onions."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience with my family, the cashier was absolutely the worst!!! Rude, and lazy!! Good food deserves good quality employees so get some please!!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. I will definitlely go back here. Super nice employees. Not a very long wait. I've been there quite a bit and I really like it. If you like cannolis, these cannolis are pretty fantastic, not gonna lie. So try the cannoli!"}
{"text":"Came in to get a quick bite to eat in my lunch break from night school. I waited 10 minutes in line just to order because they only had one cashier open. I ordered a chicken Caesar. Salad with the chicken noodle soup it looked fresh but when I got it back to class and began to eat it I noticed that there wasn't very much chicken. I ignored it being that I was starving as I began to eat I noticed there was a piece of hard plastic in my salad. I could have cut my mouth or something on it. The scary part is that the plastic was clear and blended in with my salad so if I wasn't paying attention I could have been injured. I couldn't eat any more being that I was scared of what other pieces were in there! Overall this place clearly is too new and doesn't know how to operate safely if something was broken near the salad that entire batch should have been thrown away! For the 12$ I spent I won't  be coming back"}
{"text":"So first of all!!! Shout out to the cashier Payton who made my experience here so great!!! I appreciate people like you and you made me feel normal when I walked into an establishment dressed like a hillbilly.   Anyway...  I always come here for the chocolate chip cookies. Best cookies. Crispy on the edges and chewy on the inside. I tried to go through the drive thru and it was down so I had to go in (hence the hillbilly statement).  Miss Payton comes along and welcomes me and when I ask what something is... she offers me a piece!!! Omg yes please. Well I didn't like it so I tried something else and so on. Point being... I was being an annoying customer who couldn't make up my mind and was wasting this poor girls time. She was so patient and happy to help me. She offered a bunch of suggestions on things I might like.   I ended up leaving with a turkey sandwich, which was amazing. Broccoli cheddar soup and 4 cookies (on accident)!   The food was great. The service was great. I always enjoy coming here and think you should give it a try."}
{"text":"I ordered the turkey on white bread and this was one nasty sandwich. The bread was gummy and falling apart and the turkey was huge hunks (not sliced) and even the tomato was the end piece. All & all this was a big disappointment!! Even their Dr Pepper on fountain wasn't working. Think the store is very cute and really like the merchandise they sell, but food not so much!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had breakfast there at this location yesterday morning. We had the same thing the French Toast. One word --- FAIL...Mine was cold.. I was like WTH???  The French Toast was way tooo bready and weird tasting, my eggs were werider and bacon just filled of grease, who likes that ??? Not I ... It was not was I was expecting.. I will stick to the sandwiches, I prefer wayyyyyyy better than their so called breakfasts.  They are a little toooo $$ for my personal taste.. but it's still a nice place to hang but again a little too $$.. Just saying"}
{"text":"Their desserts are the best!! I recommended the chocolate mousse if you consider yourself a choco-holic!!  It's so rich and yummy."}
{"text":"I had a sandwich brought to me yesterday while I was working in the yard. the food was good and they taste and quantity great.   But can only give them the 2 stars cause they are one of these places that are not open when I want to go.   What is this closed on Sunday that is just just right stupid in this day and age,  they wont be getting my business in the future."}
{"text":"I had the bacon, egg and cheese croissant sandwich. It was delicious. The croissant was so buttery and fluffy. The service was great and the atmosphere was peaceful and inviting. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of kneaders. I have loved everything I've tried from here. My favorites are the french dip, the french toast, and the cinnamon rolls. Just walking in the door, my mouth starts watering with the delicious smells. This is frequently my go to for Saturday breakfast with my family."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times.  I usually get the Turkey, Bacon, Avocado sandwich (served on Focaccia) for $8.  It's a fresh, very tasty sandwich, and I've enjoyed it each time. My boyfriend typically gets the same or the Franch Dip.  I've also had a Caramel Macchiato, which was as good or better than a Starbucks.  And, the chocolate dipped strawberries are awesome!!!  One is large enough to be a whole dessert.  I also like the fact that unlike some of their competition, Kneaders has a drive thru.    I found it interesting that they are part restaurant, part boutique store.  At least, that's what I call it.  We've never had an issue with the food or service, and I would definitely eat here again.  Regarding the question of bringing kids, if you can keep them away from the boutique store area, then there should be no issue.  They have some breakables and fabric things that could get broken or messed up if a child (or anyone, really) is not careful."}
{"text":"Soooo delicious that we came back an hour after our lunch for dessert!  Place is a bit slow,  but with the food.  I had the French dip,  then carrot cake.  Not a ton of meat,  but the flavor was so good I didn't miss it at all."}
{"text":"Besides not being able to find the portobella on my portobella grill sandwich, it was very good."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to get a Sandwich (the Grilled Cheese specifically, it has a super buttery soft crunch) and a treat (The lemon Muffin top thing is AMAZING) I can order a meal for everyone in my family (Omni & Vegetarian/Vegan - not a ton of options but still plenty) plus their kids meals have everything (fruit, a toy, chips, cookies, organic juice and milks) I would say it's similar to a modern home farm house meets Panera but 5x better.  Plus the store itself sells adorable modern home-farm house kitchen/decor pieces. ..I'm not going to lie I come for the food but always pick up a cute item to add to my home.   I wish they would more of those Lemon Kulous Muffin Top daily, they always run out by lunch...  Only thing I can complain about is the warm drinks because the ice machine was broken"}
{"text":"Well we kept going because the food is so good. Well there is a new man in charge. His name is Geno and what a difference he has made. Food and service...excellent.  Geno works his butt off, so if you have not been there give Kneaders a try. Tell Geno hi!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time time omg I loved it so good  I got a turkey bacon avocado salad & turkey cranberry sandwich on a croissant"}
{"text":"This was the second time here,  so giving it another chance. They were very slow getting my food to me.  The orders all around us kept coming out wrong, which also slowed things down.  Considering they were not busy, it was quite a long wait and they got mine wrong as well. The server also called out my name wrong and when I corrected her, she actually said \"whatever\". I was only trying to confirm that it was my order!!!!!  Not someone with a similar, but very different name. And to top it all of the place was filthy and my food was so blah that I will not be returning, EVER."}
{"text":"I was there on Tuesday morning at 745am and even though it said it open at 7 the dine in was close. drive thru was open. The food was excellent as always! Love the breakfast croissant"}
{"text":"Better get here before 10:30am if you want breakfast!!  Ordering process very slow!!  Food still great."}
{"text":"This morning I decided to try something I've never heard of before, Sourdough Pancakes and it was phenomenal! When my plate was delivered to my table, I could immediately smell the sourdough - it smelled so fresh! A puff of steam emitted as I cut through through the 3 stacks. Their homemade caramel - oh my, my sweet tooth loves it! It also comes with whipped cream and slices of strawberries. Lastly, I would like to also add that the staff were very friendly and patience as I watched them serve and help other customers - always a plus in my book!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Slow service. Chicken Caesar salad hardly had any chicken in it. Overpriced.  Better value and quality across the parking lot in the Costco food court.    Tries to be like a Paradise Bakery, only with a more limited and less impressive selection. I won't return."}
{"text":"Our family love their croissants! Soft and light, even my picky toddler love it! Also theres a variety of pastries and desserts to choose from. I personally love their key lime tarts.   They have a drive through too, which I didn't expected for a breakfast/ brunch place, as compared to other chains. So if you are in a rush and in need of breakfast fixed, do consider Kneaders!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here at least once a week for their breakfast! I love that the French toast is all you can eat!"}
{"text":"Four stars due to the food and the ambiance of the place. It's a charming little restaurant. I was taken back by how rude the staff was. After eating I went to make a purchase from the gift area and the associate made no effort at all to be even moderately polite. Bummer because I really liked the food! This restaurant has potential if they can staff it properly!"}
{"text":"It's okay. Not bad not great. Need to work on service. Could have sold more to us but would not come back to the counter or look up to say be right with you."}
{"text":"Good food. Very similar to Panera or Wildflower, downfall is they don't offer a half and half combo. You can add soup or salad to a sandwich but then you are dealing with a ton of food and cost close to $15 or more. The sandwich I got (Rueben) was good except for the fact that they put raw red onions on the sandwich that should not be on a Rueben. I had to pull them off. I have. Feeling it was a mistake because it was only on half. The free chips with my sandwich was nice but it lacked a sweet after lunch pick me up that other places include free. Nice place I may or may not be back."}
{"text":"Omg where do I start?! Came it to try for the first time, ordered a few bakery items. It was only 2:30pm and yet they had only one cheesecake that was almost gone, and a choc cream pie. The ladies cut the cake and pie with plastic butter knives  rather than pie servers. HEALTH WARNING: they were touching the cakes etc with the same flimsy plastic gloved hands as the ones they use to work the register. Yep- no changing of gloves!!  I got the smallest piece of cheesecake I've ever seen for $3.99!?! See pics. The choc cream pie slice was deflated like a pile of runny dog crap- how unappetizing looking and it tasted like a sugary mess. The mint brownie was DRY and toooo sweet. Lemon meringue tart was so sugary it was like a pixie stick. Choc mousse dome was disgusting, dry choc cake on the bottom.  They had only raspberry cream cheese croissants when I went in. It was NOT a croissant, no flaky layers. The raspberry was gelatinous and gross and what little cream Cheese and raspberry jam was in it was on the edges. The whole thing was dry and bready.  Overall, disgusting. This is NOT a bakery. This is a gross chain with obviously frozen disgusting items trying to say they're a bakery.   Only those who don't know real bakery quality could like this place. I hope it shuts down."}
{"text":"This place is a nice little cafe, they have lots of cool little knick knacks, awesome sweets and great bread bowls. I always get great customer service as well."}
{"text":"Definitely a favorite bakery! The Cinnamon French Toast with Caramel Syrup is the perfect breakfast. The staff is super friendly and helpful and the store always has interesting merchandise for sale. #lfthx #kneaders #kneadersbakery #organicad #kneadersonmcdowell"}
{"text":"Very unprofessional customer service a bunch of kids never seen a manager or an adult around ..while I was ordering some young boys were hitting on the cashier pretty empty this place for a evening rush ..foid is not all that either just good pastries"}
{"text":"All you can eat french toast was hard. Took forever to get a refill order and coffee and creamer was out everytime had to tell them it was out and heard multiple other customers had the same complaint."}
{"text":"Last minute,  when no one else had carrot cake,  I called and the employee happily said they had a whole carrot cake available.  The cake was ready when I picked it up.  It was delicious.  The cream cheese frosting had a little too much powdered sugar (just a personal preference)  but the cake was fresh,  moist,  and had lots of walnuts.  Definitely the best store-bought carrot cake I've had."}
