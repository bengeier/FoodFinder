{"text":"Picked out because it was off the beaten path. It was SO worth it.  Everything is home made and it shows. We just let the owner pick our dinner and had a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Used to be a good place now a disaster. Slow. Consistently slow. Were sitting thirsty awaiting drinks and food. Even the complimentary bread was brought after the main meal."}
{"text":"This USED to be the place....until maybe just over a year ago. Now nothing tastes the same. I know the kitchen staff is all new and the management so that might be it. The quality is so not nearly as good as it was. No more free palacinke to end your meal."}
{"text":"Came here the first time for a Serbian friends' baby shower and became instantly addicted to the cream cheese filling (which I later Googled online and found to actually likely be a mixture of cream cheese whipped with butter - no wonder it's so good).  I went back again recently and though I found it less impressive the second time around, it's still a heavy treat that I might go back for once or twice a year.    Even the salad is awesomely served under a huge pile of white shaved cheese, totally obliterating any green in sight until you dig underneath it.  The mixed grill platter for two ($25) might be the best pick, with about 3-4 different types of grilled meats including sausage and a small portion of pork, cheese-filled schnitzel included split into two to share.  It really does give you a sampling of a bit of everything without filling you up with just one main item, and it comes complete with a coleslaw and potatoes.  The portions here are pretty large, and if you're getting takeout you might be able to get away with feeding 3 adults with the two person platter.  The large mixed grill, in case you were wondering, is about $43.  Although it's located in a middle of nowhere/in an industrial area, it gets very busy at night so it's best to make reservations.  There are regulars here, and they will get priority over non-regulars. Without a reservation, you may not get in at all for the evening."}
{"text":"Went here with a coworker for lunch, price is ok, food is acceptable, standard food, a bit too much salt. We ordered platter for two and the bread. The bread was good and platter was enough for two guys, we didn't finish it."}
{"text":"Since a colleague took me to this place to try food from his country, McAdam became a mandatory place every time that I have the opportunity to go to Toronto. The food is really, really good and the service is SUPERIOR! Live music on weekends and outdoor tables for summer.  I have been there 4 times and every time a discover a new dish that is better than the previous one, I always finish my meals with a couple of Uzos just to make sure I complete my Balkan's experience.  The first time my colleague ordered a sample plate (sort type of degustation) and it was full of delicious meal that included all specialties form the grill served with freshly chopped onions, coleslaw and beans (called prebranac)  Next time I ordered the Pork Medallions on a Skewer (Raznici) and a Minced Meat Rolls (Cevapi) plus 3 Uzos because this was a lot of food.  Last time I tried the following: Karadjordjeva Schnitzel, the bread and the Serbian salad and was awesome.  Give a try, because the food is good, high quality, excellent service and very reasonable price"}
{"text":"This place was very good. Great food, great service and the price is extremely reasonable. Got a little smokey from the grill but otherwise it was great.   Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My family ate here, and each of us enjoyed our meal very much. The food was tasty and our waitress was excellent. We didn't have too wait too long for our food, which is great when you have two hungry kids with you. The staff are warm, and welcoming - we will definitely eat here again!"}
