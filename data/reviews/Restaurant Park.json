Price: $$$

We didn't make any reservations this time because we visited on an early Monday evening. It seems like a good idea to make a reservation whenever you plan to visit because it was packed by the time we left, surprising on a Monday night! It definitely tells you how popular and well-loved the restaurant is by us local Montrealers.

There were two types of omakase: 5-course for $95 or 6-course for $115. We didn't know there were two types prior to arrival, but we decided to go all out because it was our anniversary and all :). The full 6-course omakase gives you all the types of sushi in the house (compared to the 5-course) and you also get maki as well. I'm not 100% sure on the differences on the omakase, so ask your server.

Our dinner that evening started off with their Surf and turf noodle soup. I personally didn't fully understand as to why it was surf and turf (perhaps I missed out on what our server had said) which led me to flavour confusion: what was surf and what was turf about it? Overall the soup was delicious but I think I would've enjoyed it a little more had I not know that it was surf and turf. My husband on the other hand enjoyed it very much no matter what the soup was called as the flavours were well balanced and the lemongrass was a great choice to enhance flavours.

Our second course was brought out short after our soup and it was so beautifully plated! Tasting toro with caviar was certainly a first for us, but it will definitely not be our last! The textures, flavours, and everything else was quite mind blowing. The citrusy sauce suited the dish very well and overall the dried carrots and whole mustard seeds balanced the soft toro textures. I especially liked the edible flowers!

What we really liked about our third course was that each sushi was not only seasoned with soy sauce but also garnished with various toppings for each unique characteristics of the fish used. Everything from sweet unagi sauce (I think) to jalapeños, Korean gochujang sauce, pickles, salsa, and much more. The different garnishes definitely not only added an extra kick to the nigiri but it also represented Chef Antonio Park's three cultures, Korean, Japanese and South American, very well. I also think the different garnishes are the prime reason why you wouldn't need extra soy sauce. Each nigiri was so flavourful and it really did just melt in your mouth. This course was my favourite out of the 6 that we had (my husband's was the fifth), and I know that I'm going to come back here for more of their nigiri sushi!

We were next presented with a maki as our fourth course. To be honest this was our least favourite but we really enjoyed the condensed scallop topping. The maki itself was average, nothing extraordinary and it was futomaki style (seaweed on the outside). What topped each piece of maki was the condensed scallop \"sponge\". The texture of it was very similar to that of a soft sponge, and we were surprised that we were able to taste the scallop flavours very strongly! It really did feel like you were eating a whole scallop. We didn't fully like the scallop with the maki, and I found it impossible to put both in my mouth at the same time :P. I don't think we'd order it à la carte because we much prefer nigiri and sashimi, but we'd like to try other makis because we've seen some pretty exciting ones at nearby tables. 

Our anniversary dinner at Park was definitely a memorable one. The service we received was top notch and we enjoyed each and every course from our omakase. Between the two tasting menus, I highly recommend the 6-course because I think it's well worth the extra $20. The sheer quality of each carefully crafted dish was amazing and as a big lover of Japanese cuisine, Restaurant Park deserves a high rating! Hubby and I've enjoyed fine Japanese cuisine in many places (see here) throughout our time together, and Park's omakase is definitely on our top list. However, we've visited the restaurant for lunch before and our experience wasn't as enjoyable as our omakase was. Maybe it was because the restaurant was packed therefore our food was rushed, perhaps because the lunch menu isn't as Japanese (more Korean inspired), or maybe we visited on a bad day. Our lunch experience definitely affects the overall rating of Park even though we've had a fantastic dinner. Perhaps we'd go back for lunch on another occasion!"}
{"text":"It is not worth the price at all. We found bones in our salmon dish, a piece of shell in the urchin. I was wondering if it is normal for a $90+ tasting menu?

The service was unprofessional. Our waitress obviously did not have a clue how many courses were in the tasting menu. She kept telling us this would be the final course, and bummm, five minute later we got another one. The most ridiculous thing was when she was presenting one of the dishes, she mistaken an olive for a pear. And yes, PEAR. How the hell was that even remotely possible????????

And more about the food, since I know their fish supplier. There is nothing new/surprising to me on the raw ingredients they use. All it left here is the chef's skill, and how well mr.park put they together. The strongly sour sauce definitely ruined my urchin. And my salad was like someone pours 1 ton of sea salt on top of it.

The only reason I gave it a 2 star is for freshness of the raw ingredients, that's all, not the skills."}
{"text":"Over priced and mediocre service. The cooked items were overcooked. The makis were unimpressive. The nigiri was the only good thing. Wouldn't recommended to come here."}
{"text":"It's hard to find words to describe the food & sushi of Antonio Park: SUBLIME, GORGEOUS, DIVINE all come to mind. It's very expensive at dinner (worth every penny) but lunch is way more affordable and no less incredible, try the bim bop!
Treat yourself to Omakase dinner selected by Park himself and you'll be talking about this place for weeks."}
{"text":"No it is too expensive. Much better food in Japan. This chef is too California and not Japanese for me."}
{"text":"Irish organic salmon toro, maple syrup top torched, with kabayaki sauce. If you've never had salmon belly before, then I highly encourage you shave the soul patch off your chin unfriend Pauly Shore on Facebook and join us in 2012. Arguably the best cut of fish, the belly is unctuous, fatty, delicious and parallels the sweet warmth of a loving bosom of your significant other who's in debt to you for one reason or another and owes you a favour. Prepared by singeing the top with a torch, a caramelized crust is formed and some of the fat melts, leaving each bite close to a religious experience."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had!! You must sit at the sushi bar and order the omakase (tasting) menu. The tasting menu includes 5 - 7 courses that the chef selects. I can't remember the exact number because after the fourth course I was so happy and satisfied the rest of the evening is a blur :-) .... And towards the end of the meal, the chef surprised me with an extra course as a gift :-) 

I sat at the sushi bar, so I could watch the chef work.  It was amazing.  The chef is pleasant (we had a delightful conversation) and his food is a work of art! I was in awe. Some of the courses were so beautiful it almost felt wrong to disturb them.  

I also loved the ambiance. It's trendy without being pretentious. It's in a delightful neighborhood. And the music is great: old-school R&B! 

This was more than a great meal, it was an experience! This place makes me wish I lived in Montreal!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I reserved a table for two at Park for their omakatse menu (it means \"I'll leave it to you\" in japanese) and we were really excited about it. We were pretty damn disappointed though as our dinner definitely didn't live up to our experience. 

While the ingredients at Parks are fresh, the chef just ruined the whole omakatse experience by overdoing his dishes. We ordered the sushi omakatse menu (there are two options - one with sushi and the other without) and we were served with sushi embellished with truffle oil and different kind of sauce. The sashimi were served bathing in a pool of \"homemade sauce\".... the sauce was just too overwhelming and overpowered the taste of the sashimi. I've had much better omakatse in Toronto and other places, so sadly I'd have to say Park definitely let us down. 

The bill came up to 300 bucks for two people (including a cocktail per person). If the quality of the food was good, it would have been worth it. But Park tried too hard. You might see lots of photos on Instagram and people saying how good the dishes look, but trust me, it's not worth that much money. This place is so overhyped and we won't return again."}
{"text":"food was very good.  service was attentive, but obviously adapted to montrealers' expectations. it doesn't take you to japan.  only complaint was that the makis were large and rice was not seasoned enough to my taste, leaving the sauce as the strongest flavour.  sashimi was a winner.  no soy sauce served, none needed.  Jalapeno slices were served, but definitely un-needed."}
{"text":"Désapointant.  A 105$ par personne pour le menu dégustation vraiment beaucoup trop cher pour ce qu'on nous a servi.  Menu de 6 services au choix de chef, sans créativité des saveurs. Des goûts relativement simples et fades. En plus l'atmosphère et le décor sont franchement sans intérêt.  Si vous avez le budget pour ce genre de resto, vous trouverez dans la ville plusieurs autres excellentes options, sans avoir l'impression de vous être fait prendre pour une valise.  

Les sushis et sashimis étaient bons, mais pas extraordinaires.  

Le service était mauvais.  Nous avons demandé conseil pour agencer le vin, car comme il s'agissait d'un menu ou le chef décide, nous souhaitions être guidé pour le vin. Nous ne savions pas à l'avance ce que nous allions manger.   La réponse que nous avons obtenu m'a jeté par terre: \" madame, nous avons du vin rouge, du blanc et du saké\"... merci pour le renseignement. 

Le dessert était honteux.  Un pouding chômeur avec du bacon, très mal exécuté.  En gros, un goût et une texture d'un beigne du type Tim Horton avec trop de bacon et un tout petit peu de sirop sucré.  Je ne pourrais même pas confirmer si c'était à l'érable.  

Désolée, mais je ne recommande pas ce retaurant."}
{"text":"Interesting place. Tried the Omakase menu and I must say it was pretty impressive.
The staff are incredibly friendly and the decor is very classic and cozy"}
{"text":"Born in Argentina and raised in Brazil, and with his Korean roots and culinary training in Japan, chef Park does an outstanding job at coming up with one-of-a-kind combinations of top quality fish with unique and exotic ingredients. I sat at the sushi counter where Park personally prepared and served me each course in my omakase. Not only is the \"star\" of each dish phenomenal, the accompaniments all serves to elevate, enrich and enhance the entire plate. Park is a class of his own."}
{"text":"Overrated,over priced & most pretentious restaurant I've ever been to.

Rice was hard as stone and wrongly seasoned.fish was somewhat fresh, but that's a basic requirement for any sushi restaurant.nothing to be praised of.

too much weird sauce in sashimi for 3 possible reasons: 1. Fish was not fresh, so he has to cover them with strong sauce. 2. He's trying too hard to be different and creative. 3. Lack of confidence so he believes more is better. 

If you are going to charge $8 for a miso soup, at least put in two clams or a shrimp or something ..a plain soup out of an instant soup package is just morally wrong to ask 8 bucks. Any Asian super market will have organic miso pack for 5.99 and u can make hundreds bowls of soup out of it. Your soup worths 5 cents the most.

Been to Japan many times and have dined in numerous world renowned top rated restaurants, Park is a joke. Who is he trying to fool?!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is pleasant, waiters are pretentious for no reason, prices are WAY WAY out of touch with reality
I give them points for presentation efforts however it is not authentic sushi
Everything is covered and masked in sauces
Nigiri is all about the rice, anyone who went to Japan and ate at fine sushi establishments will know that. The rice was under seasoned (no hint of saki) was not steamed and rolled enough, the proportion of rice/fish is not right and the Achilles heal was the bottom of the rice was wet with sweet/tiryaki like sauce
Sea urchin: when the waiter mentioned that they receive fresh i was super excited to order it. However it was presented in a bowl (what??) and covered in mayo/sauces where the flavor of the urchin is gone.
The Sashimi cut was wrong, and again presented in a bowl (very strange choice for a plate since you want to display the cut, the colors, the fat/meat content of the fish when dealing sashimi)

on a side note, Fresh is not a good indicator for sushi restaurants, most Japanese chefs age their fatty fish (Tuna) for a few days before serving it to their customer."}
{"text":"Our group of four had an amazing, unforgettable  dinner at Park Restaurant during Formula1 weekend. We sat at the chefs table (highly recommend) and everyone from Gabriel, our server, to the hostess, manager, bus boys and even Chef Owner Park, made sure we were well taken care of. We ordered the tasting menu and had the joy of watching the kitchen prepare each dish and hope it was for us. The skill and attention to detail put into each dish made the experience even better. Most important, everything we ate was delicious - especially loved the nigiri platter that my husband and I shared with the tasting menu. I would not hesitate to come back to Park Restaurant for a special meal. I'm still thinking about what a great overall experience it was. The uber from downtown to this neighborhood gem was totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Writing a quick review to add my 2 cents. The food at this restaurant is top-notch. It blends traditional styles with inventiveness, arriving at creations that tickle the taste buds and make you want to eat really slowly to savor each bite. Chef Antonio Park pays close attention to ingredients, coming up with new menu items based on what's seasonal and fresh. The ambiance is a bit too upscale for my taste and the prices are steep (2 omakase dinners, 2 chardonnays, 2 beers, 1 cocktail +tip/tax = $380). If the prices were more reasonable I'd eat here every week, the food is that scrumptious."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to get a spot for two during lunch time. The decor and ambiance is chic yet relaxed and the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu items, and ingredients used. The presentation was impeccable, even though their lunch menu is about 10$-15$ cheaper than what they offer at dinner time. A word of advice, it gets busy very quickly during lunch so try to get there before noon (they open at 11:30).  I haven't experienced their evening menu yet but I've heard nothing but wonderful things, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had the sushi tasting menu. Everything was delicious especially the sashimi course. The waitress was not very knowledgeable despite the menu being small. She described all the drinks and food as just being \"very good\". Very good doesn't tell me very much about what is in it and what to expect."}
{"text":"If you are willing to spend your money on all you can eat quality sushi, then ignore this comment. Just forget about fancy sushi when you are in Montreal. The place is beautiful and the ambiance was good, but food???I had the tasting menu and I was disappointed to be honest. It's just not worth it cuz the only dish that I could remember was a piece of tuna sushi. Other plates were just not good enough and other sushi (beside the last one) taste like the fish has been left out in the room for a really long time, soft and bland. You could have a much better experience at the same price in Toronto or Vancouver."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get sushi in town, we went here for my birthday as you probably would not go to a place as upscale as Park unless for a special occassion.
We started out with the white tuna sashimi that was heavenly - tiny slices of BC tuna that was  grilled on one side and was tender and pink on the inside, marinated with a sauce that was very pleasantly unusual and distinctive.
If I do not remember wrong what I got was the sashimi plate, which had a variety of sashimi of top notch quality fish - they obviously do not shy from any expenses to make sure that the base of the food you get is the best and on top of that they are very successful in accompanying their food with sauces/sides/cooking that makes it literally 'the' excellent dish.
My mother got something like a bibimbap, which was too mucu for her, so I finished it and it was really filling. That might be a dish you can get if you want a full tummy here on a lower budget.
Since it was my birthday, we got a slice of a cake that had coconut in it, and it tasted more remarkable than any birthday cake I could have gotten. If I do not remember wrong, it also had rhubard in it and the consistency had just the perfect crunchiness that was soft enough for me to chew it comfortable and sill carry the top of the cake that was rigourously worked to infuse the flavours."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent experience!!! I am a long time Instagram follower of chef park and I am so glad that I got a chance to try his creations while I was in Montreal! Everything looks just as amazing as it tastes!!! Two of us came here for lunch and we ordered the 6-course omakase lunch for both of us ($190 including 20% tips). It started with a bowl of miso soup with slowly poached egg, followed by a bowl of homemade soba noodles with crunchy and light tempura... Then the 3 mains came as chef's nigiri, a giant chef's maki to share which is probably the best maki that I have had in my life, and a bowl of super fresh sashimi in ponzu sauce. Finally we ended everything with a delicious banana mousse cake and mango/passion fruit sorbet. We have done omakase tasting menus before and sometimes we walked away still hungry. But here you get quantity and quality. We were very content after all the dishes. The waiters here are extremely welcoming and attentive. They actually took the time to explain each course. Amazing dining experience!"}
{"text":"Just dined here for our anniversary. It was out of this world! The fish was delicate, tasty and filling. I'm a novice at best when it comes to sushi but I now love sashimi and nigiri! Service was top notch and it doesn't hurt to see a few famous Montreal Canadian players while you eat!"}
{"text":"Bon, on va se le dire mais lorsqu'on va une fois au restaurant Park, on y va une deuxième puis une troisième fois et ainsi de suite. Ça c'est le résultat de la fraicheur et qualité des ingrédients combinées à un menu qui varie aux saveurs choisies par le chef tout au long de votre soirée. Effectivement au restaurant Park, commander les nigiris du chef et ils seront préparés selon l'inspiration immédiate de l'équipe de chefs savamment dirigée par Antonio Park. Le menu évolue et ces mêmes nigiris seront différents tout au long de la soirée !  

Les petites attentions du personnel de service vont aussi venir compléter cette bonne table.  Que vous ayez une table, la table du chef ou vous soyez au bar, chaque expérience sera bien sympathique à sa manière et vous ferez danser vos papilles! :) 

Je recommande vivement!

{"text":"I went to Park restaurant in mid December of 2016 for my birthday with three friends. It was the worst fine dining experience I've ever had.

We waited an hour before being seated. We took the tasting menu which felt more like a 5-course meal rather than an actual discovery of dishes and flavours. 

Each course was spaced about 20-30 minutes apart (in terms of wait time). Our sashimi was half frozen due to this, since it was on ice - the bottom was inedible. Soup wasn't hot. The kitchen was just scrambling. 

Worst part was we were told the main was scallop and we were served duck without any explanation. 

The pros were that the cocktails we had at the bar were good, our waiter was extremely nice and understanding, and we were given a 25% discount. However, the amount we paid was not worth the disappointment and mistakes, and sending them an email returned no response. 

Maybe we got unlucky since we've heard great things about this place, but I will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I came here last summer with my boyfriend and was excited to taste some of the \"best sushi and sahimi in town.\" The sashimi was delicious, however a little too thickly cut for my liking and the sushi was great. For the main meal I ordered the jap chae with salmon. It is very rare I order fish at a restaurant but I figured he does such great things with fish, it must be good. The jap chae was so bland, I could not finish it and the salmon was so overcooked and dry, it felt as though it had been sitting in a steamer all day long. This dish really put a kink in my opinion of the night. I would try this place again but I would stick to the raw dishes."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time at Park. Excellent service, beautiful, tasty food. Tried the omakase tasting menu. Nigiri, sashimi, maki, and everything was uniquely pitched, but still totally sushi - nice touches all over the place. Went for a wedding anniversary, and was thought this was ideal for the occasion. Can't wait to go back - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Bel endroit, beaucoup de staff, très très bon, mais très très très cher! En conclusion on a passé une belle soirée, très bien mangé mais je doute qu'on retourne principalement à cause des prix."}
{"text":"OK I admit I'm very picky.  Especially regarding service.  Especially when it's going to be expensive.  Very expensive.  

Service was very good.  Our waiter made us feel very at ease and spent as much time as needed explaining menu, provenance, cooking, making suggestions- as professional as I expected.  I would say most of the staff seemed very qualified, however, and I'm only stating this because of the very high expectation this restaurant sets, the sommelier or who ever brought us our wine really was a grouch- and you know what I don't need that especially here.  

Food was amazing, I won't go into explaining the flavours, really that's for you to discover- but will say the tasting menu was brilliant- hit the mark.  The rice for the sushi was by far the best sushi rice I have ever tasted- right texture, right taste, perfect- mastering this rice is a sign of great talent.

Enjoyed ourselves.  Well worth it."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Park for 5 years. Montreal was never a great sushi city. Having lived in New York and LA, my standard was/is higher. Montreal's glut of spots featuring mayo-heavy 'specialty' rolls, then and less so now, never appealed. Until Park, that is. High quality fish, refined technique and pure in its presentation - a step change in Montreal sushi. Enough for a New Yorker to make the trek out to Westmount.

5 years is a long time, though, and eventually, all restaurants slip. Minus the institution that is L'Express, Montreal restaurants in general do not last this long. Eventually, service or the food goes down the drain. My last visit to Park was my worst ever. Not even close. A waste of money. When it rains, it pours.

Hints of bad service presented itself before.  But, on the whole, the experiences previously were always pleasant enough that the minor nuisances were brushed aside.  Not this time.

Right off the bat, the blonde hostess, not Rachel.  Every time it's as if she's doing me a favor seating me. She forgets I'm the customer. Most nights the attitude is there, I just usually choose to ignore it. This time I'm seated at the bar. WORST SEAT EVER. Not the bar facing the sushi chefs, but the bar where they store all the chopsticks and other random prepware. For the price you're paying at a restaurant like Park, every single seat should be great. Unless you're giving me a discount, don't seat me in a crappy spot. That bar is an awful location to seat any customer. Waitstaff and customer are bumping into your back all the time. You need someone to push you in, once seated, so your elbows can actually rest on the bar. You stare at a wall, and a bartender making drinks. The whole entertainment factor of a sushi bar - gone. No view out the window. It just killed the whole mood right off the bat. And the hostess knew I'd rather sit at the sushi bar. 4 seats opened up in the main sushi bar about 15 minutes after I was seated. Tell me that. I would've waited.

My typical order is the full omakase for $150, plus a few more sashimi orders. This night I was limited in time and wasn't that hungry. The seating had already reduced my appetite. So I asked the bartender for the other omakase option. I ask only because Park NEVER clearly publishes that pricing in the menu. It only says a vague \"from $85 per person.\" The blonde bartender says $150 for the full omakase with hot entrees, and $95 without hot entrees. OK, I'll go with the smaller $95 option, trusting her word, since, again, the menu doesn't outline the omakase pricing clearly. And I've come here enough, they shouldn't screw a regular, right? Bill comes due at the end of dinner (no bartender in sight), and the omakase is $115. I question the brunette waitress (more on her later) on this, and she looks at me like I'm crazy. Fine. Whatever. Less tip for you.  In hindsight, I wish I gave $0 tip - so subpar was the service. Don't have your bartender provide service, quote an incorrect price, and then expect the guest to pay for that mistake!

Lastly the service. Brunette waitress touched my nigiri. Her hand touched the fish. I don't need to say anymore. Shame on me for not calling her out immediately and sending the course back. Ick! I also had to flag someone down 3 times for water. 3 times! Pay attention.

Hope this was just a one-time slip. And not a trend. For this kind of money, the entire experience has to be top-notch. This last meal unfortunately and disappointingly was a complete waste of money and time."}
{"text":"ThIs restaurant is OVERRATED.  Don't be fooled by the hype. First, as many reviewers mentioned, the wait is VERY long between servings. I waited easily 45 mins for  the appetizer. Second, the rice is not cooked well. As any sushi eater knows, rice is the most basic and the most important thing they must master. I don't know if it's the chef's fault.....but the rice was not consistent. It was sometimes too vinegary, sometimes too sweet and fell apart.  It's really easy to have the freshest fish and have the greatest quality of fish. You just have to have to buy or order the best fish possible. People think the sushi is great because the fish is \"fresh\" and melting in their mouth. I'll repeat myself, the most important and the first thing they have to master is making a good rice. That's no way you can call yourself a sushi chef if you cannot make the rice right. You might have a great knife and the freshest fish, chef Park did not impress me. 

I was sitting at the sushi bar in front of chef Park. I was truly disappointed that he was telling me all about the numbers of restaurants and the tv shows he was going to appear on. I have sat at many sushi bar. What an experience it is to see the humble sushi chef who has worked all his life to master the art of sushi. 

I do not care about the cost of my meal, as long as it worth it.  I am sorry, but the price I paid for my meal did not correspond to the quality and the details of other sushi restaurants. 

I wanted to mentioned that I didn't try the other Korean plates on the menu. Therefore cannot comment on them, Unfortunately, I have no intention on coming back."}
{"text":"It's good, the tasting menu is worth trying but next time we will try smth else."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! I really enjoyed eating every bite. Great combination of flavours.That's really all the matters. With a glass of wine my wife and I spent $110 a person tip included. 
It looses a star because it was so crowded. I was pretty much having dinner with the table next to me."}
{"text":"Wow! Great sushi. Latina's influenced. Loved it. Nice small terrace. Seats are not  very comfortable (narrow and low). Superb food, but pricey."}
{"text":"Greeted and seated swiftly. You are coming for the food, not the atmosphere, which was plain. We ordered from the two tasting menus, one had duck the other had nigiri. It was shared. The fish was delicious, though I think it's unfair that some of the fish had received acupuncture and not us! The descriptions were sometimes too quick and we couldn't remember which fish had been served to us by the time the server walked away. The banquet seating wasn't upholstered enough to not feel the wood beneath and the table too long to make it comfortable for the waiter to pour our water."}
{"text":"Good sushi but over priced and over hyped, I would recommend you try it at least once as the chef special sushi has never disappointed (it is around 35$ for 8 pieces of sushi though..) but most of their other dishes are pretty average. The deconstructed salad is pretty good but really expensive for the ingredients that are given (you could make it yourself at home for like 10$..). Staff is usually not super nice or very attentive but they aren't the worst either."}
{"text":"This place definitely serve the best sashimi I had in Montreal, by a long shot. The fishes are so fresh. You get 4 good sauces to dip your sashimi as an alternative to soy sauce. Their nigiri are very good as well. There is no sushi menu, instead you just get the Chef's choice of sushi, but you can probably ask for specifics.

I will definitely return whenever I need a real sushi-fix; for anything else, go elsewhere. Their soup was underwhelming, even the scallop appetizer. Don't bother with the tasting menu. Just get sushi dishes.

The dessert, well though it may look nice, is way overpriced for tiny bite size cakes. Do yourself a favor, and have your dessert at a nearby bakery or even coffee shop.

The ambiance is typical casual restaurant. Just don't sit near the door during winter..."}
{"text":"OK so a short and sweet review because sometime simplicity is key. Especially in this case, when the food is so precise, so thoughtful and so exquisite that you should sit back and relax and enjoy one of life ultimate pleasure : eating. 

However your credit card better have room since it can get pricey. But a truly happy and satisfied stomach is priceless.

So go and take the omakase and trust chef park skills, he knows what he's doing. And he does it amazingly well."}
{"text":"My main complain about Park is not that it is over-priced, but that it is over-rated. 

Ok, the soups were very delicious. We had the miso soup and the soup of the day (zucchini and shiso). Both very tasty and full of character. But that was the main highlight for me. 

We had the Park sashimi, Park bowl (bibimbap) and chef's maki (their seasonal roll topped with oyster mushrooms). The quality of the fish was good but the sashimi was otherwise unremarkable. The maki was mediocre: the flavors didn't go well together and the size was huge, definitely not a bite. The oyster mushrooms were ok, but too salty to have them separately from the roll. The vegetarian bowl was alright, but again, not remarkable. If anything, the stone was not hot enough to make the rice crispy. 

We got le chocolat for dessert. It was a chocolate bavarois with peanut-flavored cream and caramel drops. No complaints there. 

Hats off to our server who was very personable and accommodating, and had a good sense of humor."}
{"text":"We had dinner at RP twice so far and are ready to say that RP seems to foster the opportunities for Montrealers to have a high-end sushi & sashimi experience with reasonable prices. 
That said, we don't feel that the whole dinner was too expensive for what we got when coming out of the restaurant (remember that some pricey restaurant used braised cabbage and carrot for half an entire dish. Boo..) : it is totally worth of every dollar we pay at RP! Every dish was a surprise and what we needed from start to end of the meal - especially, we LOVED the pan-seared fish in the course since having been craving grilled fish alike! It feels like Chef Park creates meals depending on the customer  psychic Chef Park!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable sushi, easily the most creative and high quality in the city. The Omakase menu is outrageously huge with each course seemingly more over the top than the last. Great sake list too. This is the kind of restaurant one expects to find in NY not our sleepy little borough, Park is one of the current greats in town..."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The waiting staff his friendly and very professional. Loved my experience at Park. Will be going back very soon"}
{"text":"My wife and I went out of our way to find this restaurant based on an excellent feature newspaper review we read recently.  The major disappointment was, when we arrived this Saturday afternoon, they did not offer their usual sushi fare...only a sparse weekend brunch menu. Nothing on their web site mentioned this fact. We ordered a sashimi platter over a brown mixed rice ball (for an extra $5 each) totaling $34 per person. The cost was not the issue. We wanted to splurge more on the creative delicacies they advertise.  After all, we spent over $25 round trip via taxi from Olde Montreal. The sashimi was fresh but the issue was we didn't get what we expected--a varied selection and sushi experience.  We will never go out of our way to return."}
{"text":"The food is good, but not so amazing that I absolutely need to come here and spend a ton of cash to eat all the time because I can't get enough of it, and at these prices, that's what I should be feelin'.

THE GOOD

Sashimi is ridiculously fresh. The appetizer of sashimi is to die for, and the reason why I came back here numerous times to try a wide range of their menu (at the expense of my wallet) to see what else they offered.

The chirashi however, was okay. I mean.. I like the caviar, I like that little herby cilantro thing that they put in the sashimi as well as in the bowl, but there wasn't enough rice by far, and I left hungry even after having an appetizer.

The service is fantastic. They're really nice here, fast, and very friendly. 5 stars for the waitstaff.

THE BAD

Their other offerings are not so amazing. I mean I feel like this is slightly amped up regular ol' street food, with its retail cost multiplied by a factor of .5 to make up for them being in Westmount and calling themselves 'haute cuisine'.

I could eat sushi and equally delicious Japanese-fusion (ish) food for a quarter of the price elsewhere.

This place is really for rich Westmounties who need a nice, classy, upscale-y place to go on an expense account because to come here on your own dime is just silly (yeah I'm an idiot).

Would I come back?

Sure, if someone else was paying. The food is not terrible, it's good. I just think it's overpriced by at least 50%."}
{"text":"One of my last meals as a native Montrealer and couldn't have picked a better place. Chef Park is a wizard of underwater deliciousness and every course of the omakase was divine. He asked me if I was still hungry and topped it off with a bowl of sashimi and gave me recommendations for his fav NY sushi places consisting mostly of chefs he trained with in Japan. Maybe it's all the white Burgundy talking; but when he fist bumped me after I paid for my cheque, I must say  I'm not sure what were brighter...the fireworks upon my tastebuds during the meal, or the fireworks in my mind from the amazing experience that was Restaurant Park overall."}
{"text":"Turning down Victoria from Sherbrooke Street, you'll wonder whether you've mistakenly walked all the way to NYC's West Village. Small boutiques, well-dressed people, a new rustic-chic resto... Then you'll realize you didn't - you're in Westmount, and you've found Park restaurant, the newest and most exciting addition to Montreal's dining scene.

At first, you'll notice the restaurant because of its relaxed vibe, cool \"woodsy\" décor, tall plants and airy space, but you'll remember it because of the food. Every dish has a gluten-free possibility, white rice is replaced by brown rice, the beef is hormone-free and the sushi vinegar is made with local honey instead of refined sugar. That's top quality I'm willing to pay for.

Although there was a delicious-sounding tasting menu, my friend and I decided to go à la carte. First we split the Asian salad ($9) - a beautiful veggie and fruit medley sprinkled with black and while sesame seeds that was so deliciously fresh that we could have ordered at least three more.

Decisions, decisions... They were especially hard to make when it came to choosing mains. We finally chose to share the Chef's Choice Sushi ($22) and Beef Teriaki Don ($29). Both were f-l-a-w-l-e-s-s.

The sushi was - like everything else - ridiculously fresh. It combined wonderfully unexpected tastes and melted like butter in our mouths. The beef pieces were beyond flavourful, juicy and tender, accompanied by perfectly roasted vegetables and rice.

For dessert, we chose something that resembles a sponge cake with vanilla and fruit coulis. It was good, but certainly not as exceptional as the meal. Hey, no one's perfect.

Park made a major splash on Montreal's dining scene when it first opened in February, and with good reason. The service isn't stellar or particularly warm, but the food is really, really good. Simple dishes come alive due to slight creative twists and luscious, fresh, organic ingredients. Some might say that portions run a little small, but really, it feels nice to finish a meal without feeling overly full.

Expect a nice low-key dining experience. Park doesn't try to be a go-out resto - instead of hearing the latest Flo Rida song (the one feat. Sia is actually really good!?), you'll hear what your dining partners are saying. And sometimes, that's even better.

Food 9.5/10, Atmosphere 8.5/10, Pretty people 8.5/10, Music 8.5/10, Service 7/10.

{"text":"High end sushi with the freshest fish available. It's sourced directly from Japan which is why the rolls are very up there nj price. That being said you go here accepting the price and prepared to consume art. Chef Antonio Park is a Montreal treasure. My advice for ordering: leave it up to your server. Every time I've gone I've had the nigiri tasting menu and a selection of super creative rolls that blew my mind one after another."}
{"text":"Okay, my review may be biased because he is my friend's friend BUT I am also a Japanese food snob so I may also be tough.

We drove all the way from Toronto to try his sushi (not really just for him but yeah...) because we heard great things about his food/creation and well because he's on Chopped Canada. The place is a modern restaurant with high ceilings, nice tables, sushi bar and highlight of it all was the HUGE wine display. There was some confusion with our reservation but Antonio made it happen (thank you) and we were on our merry way.

Service: The hostess and one of the waitress had a serious RBF (resting btch face) could it hurt to smile a little? But our server was nice and thorough with explaining everything (désolé, j'oublié son nom).

Drinks: I got the hot sake (medium), my sister got the Yuzu tonic (super yum) and our friend got the litchi cocktail (meh). Drinks are decently priced (11-15) but I wish they had more cold sake selection. They tried convincing me to order a bottle of sake knowing that I will be the only person drinking it even though I told them I was driving (in a unfamiliar foreign city in which lanes do not exist and the road is like a free-for-all but that's for another story).

Food: Their omakase starts at $85/person (which is decent) and goes up to $115 (I think). We ordered the fish omakase ($115/person). Our first dish was a carrot, taro root soup (I was about to lick the bowl) then we had two pieces of smoked bonito (was very underwhelming), then a platter of nigiri, tuna make (I don't understand why their maki was so big - like you can't even fit it into your mouth without choking and dying big. Isn't it supposed to actually fit in one bite?), followed by a bowl of sashimi, a julienne seared fish bowl (on the house) and finally dessert. Of all the dishes, we only enjoyed the soup and the o-toro nigiri. We ordered more o-toro nigiri (4 pieces = $50) but it wasn't as good as the one served from our platter (definitely looked like a lower grade o-toro if that actually exist?). We didn't particularly enjoy our sashmi bowl even though our favourite uni was there. We were hoping to get uni from Boston or Hokkaido but we were serve uni from Quebec - still good but mine had a foul taste unfortunately. Finally, there was dessert. Maybe I can't appreciate the finer things like plating tiny desserts in a GINORMOUS plate.. the dessert was... meh. It looked like the made 5 tiny dessert, unsure of what to do with them then some genius thought it would be a masterpiece to stick all five tiny things that didn't even go well together on to a huge plate.

Overall, I would not return because I can get even better omakase in Toronto with less than that and their rice was so lacking it didn't have the mirin taste. Our bill came up to almost $600 with tax and tips. I had super high expectations of this place because of the hype for the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is lovely. Very attentive, knowledgeable staff. Fabulous food. Great environment. Yes it is expensive and bougie, but delicious. Best miso I've had in Montreal and incredibly fresh sushi/sashimi with expert preparation. 

1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  
2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?
3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.
4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.
5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"You know, if you're going to pay this much for a meal, it needs to be outstanding and out of this world. 

Unfortunately, the food is good but not outstanding. I've had much better sushi both in and out of Montreal for far less money, so I'm not sure what the hype is about. Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad. It just isn't great. Had the tasting menu  at dinner and found it to be just ok...nothing to write home about.."}
{"text":"Located in quiet strip of Sherbrooke, on Victoria St in Westmount, Park is in a pretty dead location. There are a couple restaurants near but if you want to grab a drink before/after or walk around to people watch, you'd be out of luck. 


That said, the food is worth the drive to Westmount.   I've had sushi in upscale Japanese restaurants in Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver,Banff, San Fran, LA, San Diego, Maui and Santa Barbara and this is the best sashimi & sushi I've ever had. 

The atmosphere is modern and urban. The service impeccable. Great place! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Thought my wife and I were ordering the $85 tasting menu, was charged $95 and $115 instead.  If the $95 is the hot version and $115 is the cold, what is the $85 on the menu?  Food was average at best.  Best part of the meal was the walnut ice cream at the end."}
{"text":"Hello Sushi is it me your looking for? 

Let's focus on my two favorite things, food and service. 

The choices at Park move beyond the realm of sushi into a whole new world of Japanese fusion. For example who wouldn't love aged black angus served on a giant slab of Himalayan rock salt? I did. It was great. I want more. 

You want to order sushi which you can. You will not be disappointed. Mouth watering scrumptious, flavorful morsels of rice and other goodies. Simply, angelically awesome. Best sushi I have had to date. 

So let's talk about service. Service is the only reason I didn't give Park 5 stars. That and the really really dark decor which makes it impossible to see what your ordering or eating and which plays into the service aspect. 

Let me explain. When the menu is written on a black chalkboard in a dark room there is not other option but to ask your server what is on the menu. If the server is nervous and does not know the menu well or cannot explain to you what things are made with, there is a problem. 

As my server you are meant to be my guide into an unchartered world. If you are visibly fumbling when questions are asked I will not be able to trust you as my guide on my culinary foodie adventure and may not feel comfortable with your suggestions. 

Apart from our visibly nervous server the food was off the hook awesome with a capital A. 

Go, eat and feel bad about the bill later."}
{"text":"Normally on point in every facet, today was a big disappointment. Bento had a cucumber and tomato salad??!? And a green salad. Felt like I was at a run of the mill sandwich place. There was this beef burger with spicy mayo on iceberg lettuce (fail) and the rolls were really heavy and mushy. Fish was also not the freshest. I am writing this primarily because this place is normally on. Today, they were off. By the way, my date had the chef special maki plate and it was also just subpar. Odd. The point of writing this is not simply to be negative but rather to let the business owner know they fell well short of expectations on this occasion."}
{"text":"You know when you look at food pics and you're like, OMG, I need to eat there?  Well that's what happened.  We felt like we needed to eat here.  

You know when you eat something and you're like, damn, it's not as good as I thought it would be?  Yeah, well that happened here too.  

The Omakase at $105, consisted of 6 courses. 

It started off with a very mild chicken broth with some kimchi.  

The second dish was bone marrow with some shrimp and a heavy dill sauce. 

Next came the nigiri.  What happened to the sushi rice?  It was undercooked and not properly seasoned.  The nigiri fish was pretty good, just not mind blowing good.  Each had its own unique topping, like jalapeño, or shishito pepper, peppercorns, caviar, etc. 

Then we got some maki rolls.  I can't remember what was in them... They were alright.  

My dining companions opted for the sashimi bowl course.  The sashimi pieces were actually much better than the nigiri fish.  Albacore, Hamachi, and Chinook Salmon.  However, the pieces just sat in some watered down sauce in a big bowl.  Was there supposed to be wasabi?  

Dessert was something along the lines of a marzipan cake with some citrus garnishes.  

I think our expectations were set way too high and Park just didn't deliver.  So many accolades!  Sure, you have all these big names coming in and out of your establishment too, but c'mon... Sushi isn't just about the fish, or who you know...  your rice was a disappointment.  

Oh yeah, and what's with the bathroom situation?  Using the bathrooms in the common area of a commercial building?  You need your own bathrooms!"}
{"text":"I just remember the size of the beef short rib that came out and it was massive. It was a delicious piece of meat. I didn't enjoy one of the purée but the meal itself was very good."}
{"text":"I was such a sucker! I have been following this restaurant on instagram for months! Their mouth watering pictures made me book a table and go give them a try! 

Wow, what a disappointment! Their menu is super small, their choices are basically 1-5 items! Not to mention nothing is described, you need to ask the waiter everything because the menus have names that mean nothing. 

The food was underwhelming. We spent $100 for 3 people, we left hungry and the sushi was MEH! I've had amazing sushi for the same price! 

Do NOT waste your time!!!

For the record: I've been eating sushi for 16 years and I've eaten at the best NYC sushi restaurants. I know my sushi!"}
{"text":"We had the amazing tasting menu- Park is among the best restaurants where the fish is sourced and the freshest possible. Eating at the Sushi bar, where you can enjoy conversation while watching the masters at work in the kitchen is most fun! 

If you're visiting Montreal, or local, you can't miss dinner at Park!"}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0

Came here for lunch last summer and it was apparently their first opening day since their renovation work. 

I found their maki rolls a bit too saucey and was overly intrusive with their toppings which ended up overpowering the freshness of the fish and the actual maki. As well, parts of the sauce separated into this watery consistency. 

Their sashimi and sushi was much better compared to their maki rolls. Though the sushi rice could have a been softer in all fronts.

All in all, I feel this place tried too hard to push the envelope on their dishes and fell short on execution."}
{"text":"This is, as far as I know, the best sushi restaurant in Montreal. The quality of the fish is excellent and the rice is perfectly prepared. I have been to Japan and eaten at well-known establishments there (including Sukiyabashi Jiro), and I would place Park up there with the best of them. The tasting menu is the way to go here. It is  inventive---this is not a strictly traditional take on sushi, and there will be surprises, particularly in the condiment department. 

My only feedback would be to make the desserts more Asian-inspired. The tasting menu used to end with an interesting dessert that I seem to remember featured bean paste and granité, but on our last visit we had an intense chocolate-mousse confection that was sort of overpowering...almost like eating a massive truffle (there is a reason they are small: we could not finish it). I would love to see more fruit/bean paste/mochi flavours on the dessert menu.

Overall though, the food is excellent, as is the service. 

One tip: we reserved online and they wanted to seat us at the cocktail bar when we got there (which is a pretty questionable move, in my books). Luckily there was a spot available outside, but if you want to ensure that you get a table, it might be better to call and specify as much."}
{"text":"C'est un excellent restaurant japonais , une expérience culinaire !! Je recommande le plateau de nigiri Moriawase et le plateau de sashimi Moriawase! Les huîtres de Colombie britannique et de l'île-du-prince-Édouard sont vraiment excellentes.Je recommande ce restaurant , les sushis avec UNI sont à essayer"}
{"text":"After a wonderful walk through Westmount, my mom and I decided to have an early lunch at Restaurant Park. The experience was delightful, and the ambiance was cool and relaxed. We sat outside on their sidewalk patio and shared two lunch specials, the bibimbap with salmon and a plate with 16 or so pieces of sushi. 

Everything came fresh and perfectly put together. 

Their bibimbap was plentiful and wholesome, made with wild rice and quinoa, yummy vegetables, and a perfectly pink-flakey salmon, topped by a savory sweet-spicy dressing.

The sushi was delicious, from their smoked salmon to their tuna, along with the amazing roll that came lightly drizzled by some holy-mouthwatering dressing.

You can truly taste the difference at this restaurant -- great quality condiments, great quality fish, great quality EVERYTHING.

Thank you, Antonio Park!"}
{"text":"\"Park restaurant, you try too hard.  Keep it simple, stupid.\"

I'm somewhat amazed at what passes for a good Asian (ahem, fusion?) restaurant in Canada.  I feel very sorry for everyone there. Park is one of the most pretentious, unauthentic, and uninspired places I've been to.  Let me count his/their ill-conceived ideas...

1.  Under NO circumstances should one serve Jap Chae for $19 Canadian or US.  This is a major f'n culinary faux pas for a cheap ass Korean dish to be passed off as something else.  BTW, that's $19 WITHOUT meat, cuz that will cost you an additional $7 and $9 for chicken and salmon, respectively.  I don't care if it's 'organic.'

2.  Crazy stupid sauces that come with the sashimi dish.  No Japanese (or Korean, based on the guy's last name)  person in their right mind would serve sashimi with anything other than some good quality wasabi and soy sauce.  The sashimi plate ($38) had some pretty good quality fish; probably above average in this area. 

3.  Charging $3 for an extra side of ginger!!!  This confirms my impression that the chef is out of touch with reality.  We were told that it was a 'special' type of ginger.  Bullshit...tastes no different than the ginger I get in NYC, which is free, btw.

4.  Maki (in season).  Abalone and fluke.  Delicate fish, only to be ruined by what was added.  Truffle oil?!  Spicy mayo?!  Way to mask any flavor coming from the fish.

5.  $8 for a bowl of miso soup.  Never told how big the bowl would be, which is big.  Miso is not a soup to be consumed in mass quantities.  The cost is ridiculous if you really think about what the hell is in this simple broth.

This place needs to be closed down out of principle alone or shuttered until the chef understands the history behind some of the items they offer."}
{"text":"Great fresh and sustainable sushi. I had the Blue Fin tuna toro and it was just awsome. A lot of hockey players and celebrities rubbing shoulders if you are into those thinga."}
{"text":"Omakase on point. The flavors, fusions, a long with traditional aspects are perfection. Highly recommend going this route."}
{"text":"In the foodie wasteland of Westmount, Park is a beacon of hope.  Food here is amazing especially the sushi, probably the best in Montreal (at least in my experience).  Food is 5 star all the way.  A minor deduction for the service which can be slow and inattentive at times."}
{"text":"The best sushi, period. Had the chance to get served by Chef Park at the bar. Incredible experience and a total gentleman and such a proud Montreal talent!"}
{"text":"Spent a week in Montreal and this has been a place I've been following for awhile on social media. I had to give it a try bc his food was really like artwork. We were on bachlorette trip and it was too late to accommodate a big party so we split up and go separate days. My husband has tried them last year while I was pregnant and just told me to request each different kind of fish bc apparently this place is the only place to be able to ship in all sorts of fishes internationally. 

The Reatauranr is very upscale modern which seems to be in a nice part of town. I'm not from the area but from the looks of surrounding place it was pretty nice. It's just kind of small but it's fine it's intimate and it has a large open kitchen and wine cellar which was really well kept as it should given that it's an upscale restaurant.

I did just what my husbdan said and it was the best 150 bucks I've ever spent. Sac just downs thsve sushi like this. It was all in his pairing of fish and garnishing on top. Every bite was worth it it didn't even need soy Ans ginger! It was so delightful and melt in your mouth goodness. I'm so excited to have tried this place and I can't wait to go to Japan to get the real stuff. I have a feeling this was pretty close! Will be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Two years of going to Park and these guys are rockin' and winning it harder than ever. Every trip to MTL now must contain a trip to Park, or as I call it, the Holy Church of the Immacuate Sushi. But, I asked myself as I rolled up on a beautiful Thursday lunch at open, can they rock it as hard at lunch? 

Yes. YES. YESSSSSS THEY CAN. 

I'd never sat on their small terrace before, and it was great for soaking up the sun on a simply gorgeous day. The service was impeccable, and the friendly server had a great smile and a relaxed attitude. I went straight for the lunch tasting and a glass of very nice Greuner. Miso soup with poached egg, hamachi app, their so famous and fucking phenomenal nigiri sampler, the best grilled fish (black cod) and root veg I've ever had In. My. Life. and a nice seasonal strawberry cheesecake and basil ice cream to finish. 

I can't rave about Park enough other than to say, keep bringing it, guys. You know how we do. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"This is a Asian fusion restaurant that just recently opened in February of this year. It's located in cool ol' Westmount. Came here twice for brunch & dinner and both times? AWESOME. It's on the pricier end, but you get what you pay for. For dinner I tried the tasting menu (60$) and turns out they change their tasting menu quite often. Every week I think. Anyway it was 6 course meal and boy was I full and satisfied. Some of my courses included a panna cotta (sp?) for dessert, tofu pocket, 1865 beef, salmon tuna ceviche, cauliflower soup etc Honestly, you won't be disappointed with the tasting menu, but prepare to spend at least 70-80 for that. I highly recommend ordering the sushi, I find it's their signature. So don't expect Kanda/Tokyo/Odaki kind of sushi. I'm talking high-end quality sushi here. For brunch I tried a more regular menu. I ordered a bibimbap and my friend ordered a kim chi B.L.T. I wished I ordered the kim chi B.L.T but I have a soft spot for bibimbap. I tried the other dish as well as my own and both were spectacular. The bibimbap was sweet and spicy, tasted really healthy. I believe the rice was brown and the portion size was just right.  The B.L.T was the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had in my life. Great combination with egg kimchi bacon, lettuce and tomatoes. I had a mediocre smoothie though. But that's fine, they dont specialize in smoothies anyways. I am definitely a fan and will be a regular. Highly recommend the tasting menu. Oh and make sure to reserve!

PS My only complaint is the waiters/waitresses need to improve their service more for example being more knowledgeable with their food, less redundant when explaining the menu, and being more natural. I found that one of the waiters that was serving me the third time I came, to be a very unnatural and came off a bit fake."}
{"text":"Wow, just an amazing experience. My boyfriend and I sat by the bar and watched the chefs work, which is an experience in itself. Food was fantastic and worth every bite. The seafood is so fresh. We got the sashimi bowl and some of the sushi rolls which were to die for. Each sushi roll had a unique flavour that you seriously can't find anywhere else. Gotta try it to believe it! Although slightly out of the way from the closest subway station, it's worth the trek! Made our trip to Montreal a very pleasant one. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Much of the food was very good but the space is uncomfortable, too brightly lit, the music was too loud, and the service was kind of invasively pretentious.  The waitstaff  tried to grab my partners plate while she was eating and when she told him she wasn't done, stood next to her waiting for her to finish.  $350 was too much for the overall experience."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of meeting Antonio Park when I used to work at Kaizen Sushi Bar in my college years. I guess I've upped my sushi standards since then. 

Good : A nice intimate environment, we had to book a week in advance for a table...on a Tuesday night. Our waitress, Rachel (and former colleague from Kaizen!) was very knowledgeable and courteous. I had the Omakase menu and every dish was beautifully plated.The sashimi was fresh and quality was top notch.

Bad : my date. 

Bottom line : Food was great. Just [secretly] glad I didn't have to foot the bill on the first date. I'm not about that life."}
{"text":"Unlike some others, my expectations were more than met after months of following Antonio Park on IG. My companion and I had wonderful service from start to finish, which was never intrusive but very attentive. I started with a mellow glass of Chardonnary and we shared the Asian salad. It was fresh, had crispy shredded vegetables with almonds and fried garlic - perfect palate opener. We then shared the Nigiri Sushi Moriawase and the Sashimi Moriawase, with an added order of Toro sashimi. I loved the different toppings on the nigiri sushi which accented each type of fish, I would have never been able to imagine some of them myself but I enjoyed every morsel. The sashimi came with soy, a chimichurri sauce, a basil-based sauce, and a butternut squash based sauce (if memory serves me correctly). We focused on keeping it simple with plain soy and the chimichurri sauce to add a little variation. The toro was melt-in-your mouth delicious, and the various other slices were excellent. They all tasted extremely fresh, which is what impressed me the most. For dessert we also shared the chocolate/peanut butter plate which had an interesting texture and wasn't overly sweet - a wonderful ending to a much anticipated meal."}
{"text":"Third time here!
- 1st time (maybe 2-3 years ago) : had a miso soup, a selection of sashimis, a grilled fish etc. Everything was good, but... I didnt feel the \"Antonio Park\" vibe with our selection. 

- 2nd time: for lunch! Not so expensive, korean-esque plates! Had sweet potatoe noodles and bibimbap! Everything was good, would totally go back for lunch!

-3rd time: That time was the BOMB. We had the OMAKASE menu during the easter week-end. That was truly the experience we were looking for. Yes it is more expensive, but well worth it if you have tried a lot of sushi places in Montreal and you're looking for something extra special. Everything is balanced and calculated in those plates. The only thing you have to do is take your time to eat. 

For the omakase, each of of us had: 
-The soup (which was already quite big)
- The sustainable blue fin tuna sashimi
- A selection of 7 various sushis with distinctive tastes  (You can actually taste the fish and the little add ons that are not overpowering) 
- 4-5 pieces of a glorious and chubby maki roll
- 9 piece plate of sashimi
- A decadent carrot cake (with a basil/citrus espuma) all of that in a white chocolate egg shell

Truly memorable experience."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday, for the wait the food was just meh. The service also was a little lacking. But when you factor in the price it's a real disappointment, $7 for miso soup? Really? And 20 for a Bi bim bap. I mean if it was that good I wouldn't mind."}
{"text":"After seeing countless photos of beautifully prepared sushi platters, we decided to check out Park during a weekend trip to Montreal. I wish we took the time to read reviews prior to booking our reservations. 

Service was terrible. I would have expected better service from a Swiss Chalet, let alone a \"high end restaurant\". I understand preparing aesthetically pleasing dishes take some time but we waited 30-45min between every dish. I looked around the restaurant and noticed that everyone was also waiting around for their food so it certainly wasn't a one-off. When the server was clearing our table he accidentally spilled sauce all over the table and dripping onto my designer handbag. I couldn't blame him as mistakes happen. He promptly cleaned the table with a cloth and when I asked for another to try to wipe off my bag, he handed to me same dirty rag!!! I could only stare at him in shock. How dense can someone be that they offer up a wet, dirty, stained rag to clean an expensive handbag?!?! 

The food was pricey and underwhelming. The fish on the sushi was thinly sliced and overall inferior to that of Toronto restaurants. The one redeeming quality was that I was full (after spending $200 for 2 people). I read that other diners left hungry...the key is to order the bibimbap which was very filling ;) 

After the poor service and disappointing meal, I am really nervous to visit any other Antonio Park establishments.  

PS. Check out the \"menu\" section of the photos to read a response from Chef Park to one diner.....it really demonstrates how Park does not understand customer service at all."}
{"text":"Have eaten here multiple times and come away happy each time. On my most recent visit I brought two Japanese friends who were visiting Montreal.  They thoroughly enjoyed the food and felt that the miso soup was better than they often have back home!"}
{"text":"calm down people, this is not good sushi - although good service and gorgeous dining area.  wasn't worth the hike over to Westmont"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best meals I have eaten in Montreal. Usually I don't eat high end sushi because I don't feel like there would be that much of a difference, but Park Restaurant just blew my mind.

First off, the restaurant is smaller than expected, really cosy but also gives a fancy and luxurious vibe. The waitress is super welcoming and friendly. They answered all my questions patiently and presented each piece of sashimi and nigiri with detail which really helps since I am not a pro in sushi (some sashimi really look alike, don't they?).
Since I wanted to try a little bit of everything, I ordered the moriawase sashimi, the moriawase nigiri and the chef's maki. 

- moriawase sashimi: It blew my mind because of how fresh it was. Each type of fish has its own texture and flavour (I never noticed that before when I ate sashimi in sushi buffet). Even the salmon one tasted different. I love love love the white tuna, it melts in your mouth. The three sauce they offer you are great as well. My favourite is the basil one.

- moriawase nigiri: The presentation is so on point. All the nigiri tasted different since all of them has their individual complementary sauce and topping. You don't need to dip it in anything since I was told that the rice was already seasoned, which is great because when I try to dip nigiri in soy sauce it often becomes super messy and soaked...

- chef's maki: super expensive, it comes to 5$ per piece of maki, but it is definitely a new maki experience that I have never had before. The maki we had had tempura inside and was topped with shrimp. The maki were huge, couldn't put a whole one into my mouth. The shrimp on top alone was super tasty, the shrimp was juicy and flavourful, but at the same time you could still taste the natural flavour of the shrimp. The sauce is really tasty but it does not cover the natural flavour of the ingredients.

It was a pretty expensive meal, but I think it was worth every penny. I'll come back for sure but I'll probably come at lunch or brunch since the prices are more affordable."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday for lunch. Note that weekends they do not have the usual week lunch menu. It is a brunch menu that has a few traditional breakfast items with a twist.  There are also some healthy lunch options such as bibimbap.   I had the deconstructed salad for 2 which consisted of iceberg, mixed greens, lentil and quinoa salads. A nice light lunch. The green tea is unique in Montreal which is a private import. A must try for green tea lovers!"}
{"text":"Chef Park touched my mom's shoulder and I told her to never shower again. LOL. Chef caught me staring at him when sitting at the sushi bar and the first thing that came out of my mouth was \"Hi, Im a big fan\". I've never felt like such a groupie in my life but honestly he gives me every reason to. I had the omakase and all I have to say is ...beautiful. Every dish and bite was well thought out, from the miso soup with pouched egg to the nigiris to the light and airy raspberry merengue dessert. Chef Antonio Park knows what he's doing and I'm so happy Montreal has a culinary legend. By far the best sushi in Montreal! You will never look at sushi the same way after trying Park Restaurant."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Japanese restaurant in Montreal. Fresh, delicious and never disappoints. The staff is great at helping pick from the menu, will keep going back!"}
{"text":"Even though there were some slight problems, this place gets a 5star because the problems weren't food or service based... I'll explain later. First of all, I want to say that if your only sushi experience is Kanda or other all you can eat buffets, this isn't the place for you. The food is prepared different and the price point is a bit different too. LOL

I called for a reservation and was told we could only sit at the bar. No problem, my fault for waiting last minute to make a reservation.  The only problem with sitting at the bar is that the plates they serve the food on are far too large for the small area at the bar. Meaning, my plate was interfering with the lady to my left's personal space. 

I ordered the tasting menu (Omakase) for 105$ which replaces a seafood dish with actual sushi. My husband got the braised beef ribs and a 6 piece sushi starter. Everything was incredible. The seafood was so fresh you could actually taste the ocean on them.  What made me even more happy was the way the food was presented. Everything was nice on wooden planks, nicely decorated, and perfect pops of color.

Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and explained each piece of sushi to me as she set the plate down in front of me. She was quick to offer my husband suggestions on what to eat since he isn't a big fan of sushi (he took me there for my birthday dinner).

As someone in the restaurant business I have to say that it was amazing to see such a knowledgeable staff, a staff that goes above and beyond to help each other out, and most importantly, a CLEAN kitchen! You can see directly into Park's kitchen and that kitchen is spotless!

The only thing I disliked (besides my food invading the personal space of someone else) is that a few times I saw the waiters carrying the food improperly. Basically, a waiter was holding a plank of sushi from the top so his hand is practically touching a piece of sushi. Food should never be handled like that. The same waiter served two bowls of soup with his thumbs in the soup bowl.  To me that isn't enough to change the rating froma  5 star to a 4 star because it had nothing to do with the food or my personal service. Just a little something that Chef Antonio can talk to his staff about.

Will I be back, yes for sure. Will I order the same thing? Probably not. Next time I'll just order sushi (maki and nigri) instead of the full tasting menu. I don't like ALL types of sashimi."}
{"text":"My favorite bite of food along my trip in Montreal came from Park. There is something so beautifully simple yet insurmountably complex about fantastic sushi and Park nails it on ever level. 

A friend of mine had been a regular here during a 3 month work trip and gave me the advice that I will pass to you now - get the Maki and the Nigiri, everything else is just good. The Maki and Nigiri were amazing and as for my favorite aforementioned bite, that goes to the mackerel nigiri special, pictures top right below. 

Service was great as expected but the food and the value (as we were shocked at how low our bill was for what we ordered) stand out."}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi I have had north of the border. Fresh and delicious! We started with the Asian salad that our server recommended. What a great recommendation! We then had the 9 piece sashimi and then the specialty roll - which changes daily. This restaurant had it going on. Excellent service. Excellent food. Excellent drinks - try the kimchi Caesar! Just divine!"}
{"text":"There has been a lot of mixed critics for Park, either preaching it or dismissing it and I think this variation is due to the different definition of a good sushi that people have. Park serves traditional japansese/south american fusion sushi a large selection of fresh fishes and delicate seasoning. Therefore, the odds of ingredients such as tempura shrimp or mayo are very slim. 

The flavours are a lot more on the delicate side, bringing out the taste of the different fishes. During my visit, we ordered a deconstructed salad for 2, a selection of nigiri and a selection of sashimi. I was pleasantly surprised by the salad, which consisted of a large selection of vegetables and toppings as well as different sauces, each with their speciality - a definite must try! 

I don't know enough about fishes to judge the sashimi slices, but the pairing of the different flavours with the different fishes on the nigiri was very good and interesting (it makes use of south american ingredients such as hot peppers).

Overall, I had a great experience here. The food is not cheap but you are paying for the quality and selection of fish (and the ambience of the place)."}
{"text":"I liked this place.  The decor is up there with my favourite restaurants.  This is the style of place I love...not too fancy but still classy and cool.

The food was awesome.  I tried a few different dishes but loved the sashimi I had.  And the desert was killer!   I'm not usually a dessert guy but this sandwich type thing with amazing.

Next time I wil llikely have the sampler because everything looked great on it!  The chef here obviously takes pride in his work."}
{"text":"Amazing. Hands down the best sushi I have tasted yet. No lie. Went there for dinner on a Friday evening in May and was not disappointed. Can't you tell by now I was very satisfied? Let me tell you more.

After hyping it for many months now, I finally got to taste it. At first, I was scared that all the hype that I have built over the months will end up disappointing me. I was not let down. OK, time to stop talking about my hype and delve into the actual food and experience. 

Located in Westmount, this restaurant serves, you guessed it, sushi, among other things of course. The decor was nice and cozy. The staff was also welcoming and knowledgeable about their menu. As for the menu, they offer different plates and dishes, which also includes tasting menus - one more \"table d'hote\" style and another one which is a sushi tasting menu. We went for the latter. The tasting platter comes with about 25 pieces per person, which is sufficient to be full but not sick from the amount. It includes different pieces like various kinds of sashimi, nigiri and maki. The sashimi were really good, with great texture for every kind of fish. The nigiris were also great, but what was really really good were the makis. They were so tasty, with great mix of flavors in your mouth. To be noted, the sashimis were also accompanied by different sauces, which were all good.

Overall, this was a great experience, albeit expensive. For a guy who is used to crappy AYCE sushi, I am not sure if I can get back after tasting such high standard food. Recommended 100%!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are some negative reviews for Park Restaurant, I had an amazing time while I was there.

The atmosphere was pleasant, it's an great place for an intimate dinner with a significant other or with friends. It had a modern look with an open kitchen. The staff were extremely nice, professional and welcoming. Since I was dining alone, I opted to sit that sushi bar. Watching these chefs prepare the individual sushi pieces was quite amazing and it shows the care that is required when making sushi.

Since I sat at the sushi bar, I had the Omakase menu for $105, which consisted of a 6 course meal, which had some of the best Nigiri I've ever had in my entire life.

it started off with a organic miso soup with kimchi, seaweed and a 2 hour poached egg. The richness from the soup was cut from the pickled kimchi flavor. The poached egg added an additional texture to the soup, the yolk had slightly been cooked but still had its liquid form.

Then came the Smoked arctic char with squash cream spaghetti , brown buttered pumpernickel croutons and a lemon rind puree. the idea of lemon rind puree was unexpected but delicious! The Arctic char had a slight crunch and the squash spaghetti was incredible.

The Nigiri rolls were amazing, it was a great blend of Japanese cuisine with Canadian and Argentinian flavours. Each Nigiri had its own unique toppings and the each piece consisted of a different fish, i.e. There was an acupunctured Red Snapper which just melted in your mouth. Thanks to my server Tudor for taking the time to tell me what each piece was.

The 4th dish was a braised lamb shank with a raisin vinaigrette, curried hummus and baked chickpeas.The lamb didn't even need the knife, I was pulling it apart with my fork. it was amazingly tender and melt in your mouth. The Vinaigrette added a great sour flavor and the chickpeas was an excellent crunch.

The next course was a sashimi bowl, that had some unique pieces. Japanese Flounder, Chinook Salmon and hamachi.

The last course was a black forest cake. After the incredible meal I had, the black forest cake was underwhelming. It wasn't really anything special and I was a bit disappointed.

Overall, I had a great time at the restaurant and I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Park Restaurant Montreal is a sushi restaurant located in Westmount, 378 Av Victoria. The flavors at Park includes traditional Japanese cuisine with Korean and South American roots from Chef Antonio Park. Seafood is sustainable focused. Park has a private import seafood license that allows the freshest, line caught fish along with daily fish flown directly from Japan. The flavors are clean and includes a fusion flare.

Celebrity Chef Antonio Park's restaurants Lavanderia Restaurant and new restaurant Jatoba were recently nominated in Air Canada's enRoute magazine Best New Restaurants in 2015.

Option for the sushi bar. This is the most entertaining seat in the house. Watch the chef at work deconstructing a blue fin tuna. It is usually challenging to get a table reservation; so call ahead of time. 

We highly suggest the omakase tasting menu for $115 per person. Table service is $105. If you are still hungry, add a few addition off the menu.

You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very friendly and personal services. The food is very imaginative, presentable, quick and of course delicious! It's still very authentic Japanese but with a twist of western touch. E.g. Miso soup slightly spicy and chef's maki added mushroom and herb on top. The 2 of us had a 6-course set for 1 person and added a maki roll, portion just right. Will come again. Not giving it 5-star cause I'm a picky eater and has tasted better food."}
{"text":"The floral decorations are my fav thing about this restaurant, then the service and, sadly, last is the food. My partner and i got dinner here tonight(march 2018). For appetizers we got a miso soup, a soup of the day(cream based zucchini and shiso) and sashimi. Both soups came in generously large bowls and were  excellent (perhaps my fav miso soup in town). The sashimi appetzer was good. 3 fish types is an appropriately mild citrusy sauce. It was nice, but not at the level expected from a high end sushi place. We then got the vegetarian park bowl and the special maki (tuna and salmon, mushrooms on top). There was nothing outstanding or particularly satisfying about the vegetarian park bowl: you can get the same/better bibimbap at jumak on queen mary or kinka izakaya in downtown; definitely overpriced and not worth coming back for. The maki was the most disappointing for various reasons: it was a struggle to \"fit\" each piece in our mouths which is reminscent of cheaper sushi places that attract customers with quantity vs quality. The mushrooms were tasty but completely overpowered the fish. I'd say you could barely taste the fish which is a huge disappointment for a sushi lover. We got the \"le chocolate\" for desert and luckily it didn't totally disappoint. It mainly included chocolate bavarois and peanut epsuma. The chocolate bavarois was great: nice soft chocolate with the perfect level os switness. We could barely feel the peanut flavor in the epsuma; but it was creamy and tasty. So not a HUGE deal... I should confess that we saw some nigiris on other tables and they were served in a pefect size and shape and the fish looked very nice. So there's a chance that we missed the best item on the menu. But even if that was true, it wouldn't raise my overall opinion of this place to anything above 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"The Good: 

* Much of the food is very good, best quality sushi / sashimi I've had in Montreal thus far. A bit fresher and better than Jun-I's. Some of the fish tasted, pardon the imagery, as if the chef had just killed it. 

* Nice ambiance. Particularly on the inside. The small terrace is okay, but occasionally punctuated by loud sounds of cars along the main streets.  

* Excellent selection of uncommon sakes and beers. The Joe Beef lager (made locally at Joe Beef, presumably) was excellent

The Bad: 

* Somewhat overpriced. The posh location in Westmount caters to wealthy residents for whom money isn't an object, and hence price inflation. For instance, glasses of wine run $14-16-- and wine portions are small. 

* The menu situation and waitering service were absurd, almost on the level of a Monty Python sketch. . . There is no print menu, everything is written on three large chalkboards within the restaurant in medium-sized letters. This is all well and good, and works in certain pubs and restaurants. But given the layout of this restaurant and the size the text was printed in, this method is not particularly helpful to those who don't have great vision, or those sitting on the terrace, where we were. 

From the terrace, the menu inside the restaurant is either completely or partially obstructed, but in any case too far away to see. The waiter then attempts to recount verbally all the items on the relatively long menu, sans prices. (Who needs to know the prices of what they're ordering, right?) Our waitress had selective memory: she would recount only random drinks and items. 

After ordering appetizers based on the choices she listed, and thinking that they sounded strangely sparse, out of curiosity I got up and walked inside the restaurant to look at the menu boards (awkward, considering one is in the way of the people dining therein). Thereupon I realized that there was not just one salad, as the waitress had said, but a choice of 4 salads, not 2 sushi appetizers, as she had said, but actually 5, not 1 X, but actually 3, and so on. 

She had ordered my friend \"the\" salad, and when it arrived, he found out it was one of the more fancy salads on the menu. He had wanted a plain salad. When he asked why she'd put an order in for this one, and not mentioned all the available choices, she said 'That's the one most people get.'

Anyway, long story short, this menu situation and selective memory on the waitress' part led to all sorts of zany mishaps. Additionally, she did not really explain any of the sauces and so on that were paired with the sushi dishes, leaving us wondering how we should eat what with what, and would disappear for long stretches at a time. 

In conclusion to this epic tale: Good food, decent ambiance, questionable prices, absurd service. To become the fine establishment this place aspires to be, they definitely need to work at least on the latter aspect."}
{"text":"We got the tasting menu. They bring out one course at a time so if you are going to go, make sure you slot out a couple of hours. We got there at 12:15, ordered by 12:30, and didn't get our last course until 2pm. The food was definitely good."}
{"text":"I was in town from Connecticut which is my current address.  Now, I've eaten in my fair share of upscale Manhattan restaurants.  As a Vegetarian I am pretty particular about my food choices and have no problem dropping serious coin for fresh, delicious food.  I was shopping in the area and decided to drop in and have a relaxing lunch.  I was impressed by the space and the vibe of the place so looked forward to a memorable meal.  Upon entering the space I was asked if I was waiting for someone to join me.  I said I would be dining alone.  I was shown a lovely table in the middle of the room and given a menu. I proceeded to wait and .............wait.  I watched as others  who were seated after me had their orders taken and were served.  I was completely ignored by every single member of the wait staff.   After 25 minutes I got up and asked a server who my server was as I would be writing a review and wanted to mention him or her by name.  At that point I was asked if I was waiting for someone. I left to go spend my money elsewhere.  I will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Visited Park for the first time after hearing good things. This place has a nice vibe with a direct view into the kitchen. We started with their soup of the day, a beef consommé with tofu. The soup was not bad, better than the usual miso. We then ordered the asian salad and scallops which were both very fresh. The waiter then brought out a platter of different sushi and nigiri all of which was presented elegantly. The sushi was very creative and as fresh as good sushi places in MTL. 

For dessert i had the date pudding which was not overly impressive for the price. I had a chance to try the lychee cocktail which was one of the better ones i have tried. Overall the meal came to $280 for 2. The sushi was not as fresh as i expected. We also came on an evening where the entire restaurant was forced to hear the inane rants of one extremely rude group of ppl to which people around us complained on many occasions, with no action from the staff. Not sure this place is worth the price there are many creative sushi joints in MTL which charge a more reasonable amount."}
{"text":"Delicious tasting menu, and chill decor for Westmount. It's odd to trek out there for a meal like that and feel like there's nowhere really to go after, but really the dodgy neighborhoods with the good bars are just on the other sides of tracks or underpasses. This ex-Kaizen chef is stretching out, having fun, enjoying the freedom and space and you can tell. The sushi is exceptional for Montreal (we are freaking far from an ocean, don't get your hopes too high up.) The sweet salmon was the best, and in general the sushi were original, with flowers and herbs and perfect seasoning. Well worth the trip if you are craving some of the best sushi in town."}
{"text":"PARK richly deserves all the notoriety it gets. Chef Antonio Park knows how to keep customers coming back. The service is great and the food is always unique, fresh and delicious. Whereas a pricey dinner option, in this case you get what you pay for......it's worth it. The lunch option is a good choice as well, very reasonably priced with good portions. It's no surprise it's a favorite among local and visiting celebs."}
{"text":"WOW !! Que dire de plus!!! J'ai adoré mon expérience du premier plat jusqu'au dessert! Nous avons pris le menu dégustation de 6 services (possibilité d'avoir 5 services pour 95$ chaque ou encore 7 services pour 125$ chaque), pour 115$ par personne et nous n'avons pas été déçus du tout! Tous les services étaient exceptionnels!

D'abord, il y a la soupe miso, délicieuse! On enchaîne avec une portion de tataki de boeuf! C'était trop trop bon!! Ensuite, il y a une assiette de 8 nigiris. Le poisson était tellement frais qu'il se coupait tout seul à l'aide de la baguette! C'était fou ! Vient l'assiette de 6 géants (oui oui géants) Makis au tartare de thon avec tempura sur le dessus, tout simplement formidable! Finalement est venue l'assiette de sashimis, délectable!!! Je capote sur le restaurant !!

Le prix est très bien justifié par la qualité, saveur, fraîcheur des aliments, le service impeccable, la beauté du restaurant, well, on paie pour l'expérience!!"}
{"text":"I ordered salmon and rice my first time there. I miss out on the sushis they offered next to my table and I couldn't keep my eyes off that table. My meal was a mixture of salmon and rice with seaweeds, the food is amazing. I am still bum out for not ordering sushis because I heard Park, the owner, have the freshest sushis in town. The docoration is superb with an elegant touch. I also remembered my boyfriend told me that the two persons next to us have a tab of 400$.  it is quite expensive there and I recommend to bring minimum 100$ if you want choices. Overall, most of the dishes range from 20$ to 90$. 

I shall be back!"}
{"text":"The best sushi I tried in Montreal. 
This restaurant is a bit pricy, but food is worth it. The fish is of the best quality, service is top notch. Great place to celebrate something or anything, anytime!

Love love love their maki rolls!!!


Gluten free soy sauce available."}

{"text":"I wanted to try this sushi place for awhile and heard alot buzz about it as a huge sushi foodie, i went there with my wife this month.

Unfortunately I was really disappointed about the food, yes the fish quality is amazing but the seasoning and \"sauce\" for each nigiri was mostly flavourless...i mean for the price of the plate i was expecting more. 
We had the nigiri plate 12 pcs and the chef maki. 
The maki was salmon, albacore, mushroom, truffle oil and \"teriyaki sauce\". The salty sauce was overpowering the fish and rice so we couldn't taste the blend of every ingredient (what i am expecting when i eat maki)... The sauce left a after taste in the throat...:(

Service: fast and polite

Conclusion: fish quality is there but too expensive to pay for only the fish...i mean for that price we can expect a explosion of flavour at each bit, it didn't happen unfortunately. Check the box, i won't be back."}
{"text":"Over-rated - don't bother trying for the price.

In my dictionary, a restaurant at this price range shouldn't be worth trying if it is rated under 4*.

Went there with a friend to try their tasting menu at $55...what a disappointment!

Below are what we got:
1. Miso soup with with a soft boiled egg - OK but nothing special
2. 2 pieces if hamachi with a mango sauce - fish was tasteless and the mango sauce didn't pair well with the fish
3. Assortment of niggiri - they all tasted the same although different fishes were used. Fish was flavor less and the rice was poorly seasoned 
4. Fried fish filet with some vegetables - fish was OK but vegetables were salty as hell. I came to a sushi restaurant  so why are you serving me a fried fish filet?!?
4. Basil ice cream with crumble - this was the only dish that game me a hint of surprise. The basil flavor is very pronounced and interesting. Not to say that I would buy it at a ice cream shop but it was interesting.

I only took a coke and the bill came up to $75 including tip. For that price, I would have expected a much better quality and flavor of the food.

Don't let my pictures fool you. This place is definitely not worth trying. If you want good sushi, message me and I will recommend much better restaurants. Almost feel like I would have been more satisfied going to Sushi Shop!"}
{"text":"Since we haven't seen our waitress in 30 minutes,  I might as well write this now, while still waiting for her to come back.

As lovely and nice as she is, it doesn't make up for the fact that we're averaging 30 minutes between courses for an omakase menu, that would more aptly be named a 'table d'hôte'. 

We started with a soup (read: broth with a few noodles dropped in for good measure). Taste was nice, but not memorable enough to describe it (2.5 hrs after eating it). 

Next came a lobster entree, sitting on some sort of mashed potato bed with corn over it. The mix of textures was fun, and it tasted above ok (say 7 on 10). 

Then came the nigiri. 7 types. Maybe it's a Montreal thing, but I prefer when they bring each piece on its own. Alas we got a platter of nigiri and had to pick our own order (glad we left the one with the jalapeño for last). The fish were fresh and the seasonings were unexpected. Unfortunately, the rice was undercooked: hard and dry. The rice made the entire nigiri selection drop to 6/10. 

The rice was so disappointing that when our waitress came to ask how the food was I had to say something. I believe my comment went along the lines of \"the fish is great but the rice is dry and hard\", to which she answered \"oh no! I will let the chef know\". That was 1.5 hrs ago, she never mentioned the rice again. She also didn't ask again how the rest of the food was.

The nigiri platter was followed by a maki roll. This is most of my reason for calling this a table d'hôtel instead of an omakase... Our table of 2 got 8 pieces of one type of roll. Not exactly a 'tasting'. At least the rice was better cooked.

We eventually got a dish of sashimi. It was fresh -- not special enough to stand out, in a good way or a bad way. 

We were then asked if we wanted to try the Uni. Hoping for a highlight of the night we went for it. The Uni was fine, the real star of the show was the truffled dwarf peach. Apparently you can find jars of this stuff for $22.

We wrapped up our 2h40 meal with dessert. A cake-y thing that I can't remember 10 minutes after eating. I don't really want to remember, I just want to go home now. 

Oh there's the bill. $300+ for 2 people. 

I can't waste more time or mental effort on this place. Go to Mikado. Or drive out to Katoreya. Seriously."}
{"text":"This place was nice. Food was good. But service could be better. Order a plate of sashimi.. and they didn't even bother coming to check if it was all good.  Drinks were very original. 

Oh ya.. music was too loud here :(


Expensive? Yes! 
Visit Again? Maybe when I have better earnings lol"}
{"text":"It took me quite a while to convince myself to revisit for the 3rd time Park Sushi. My initial experiences had left me wanting more from what was proclaimed as 'the best sushi on the East side.'However, ranked at nb 13 on the canadas100best restaurants list, I figured this place probably had some merit and deserved a closer attention at what made it shine, the sushi.

Located in posh Westmount, just below the trendy shopping west side of Sherbrooke street, Park stands alone in the restaurant scene. Nested on the first floor of an office building, it's warm wood heavy decor welcomes you to a rather untypical but very modern layout for a sushi restaurant where the sushi bar fuses as one with the open kitchen in the back.

We were seated at the bar and greeted warmly by our bartender/waitress who was surprisingly down to earth and had no problem calling for help when our questions on the wine list surpassed her knowings. The wine list itself is heavier on the dry whites as it pairs better with sushi and with the help of our servers we picked a perfect bottle of white from Greece. Great way to start the night as we tchin-tchined onwards to the menu!

Having visited twice already and being disappointed with their omakase tasting menu, we decided to stay away from their hot menu items and focus on their sure beats - the sashimis and nigiris as well as the chef's maki. Needless to stay, this 3rd visit was by far the best. Yes it's pricey, but it's definitely the most mouth watering bite of fresh raw fish you'll find in Montreal. Especially their nigiris which are all individually topped with different little garnishes (jalapeños, black caviar, fresh herbs) and lightly pre dipped in soy sauce. You don't need to do anything to it besides put it in your mouth and let the tenderness of the nigiri melt in your mouth! Yes mouth watering indeed! We were also lucky enough that evening that the chef's maki of the day was topped with blue fin tuna, the most buttery piece of fish you'll ever taste hands down!

The night had been going so well at that point that we decided to be tempted into dessert. Their desserts are not the typical green tea ice cream and fried bananas you'd usually find in a Japanese restaurant. Creativity shone through as classic flavours meet epicureanism. Chocolate moelleux with blood orange creme brûlée and a match chiffon cake anyone? Yes, me please!

Needless to say, we definitely left this time highly satisfied. Excellent service, great wine pairing perfectly with high quality food and to top it off an amazing dessert, what more can you ask for? The saying 'third time's a charm' definitely encompasses how we felt from our visit. We'll be back for a forth! But from now on, only sushi :)"}
{"text":"Shockingly rough around the edges, and not in a charming way.

After being seated, 25 minutes passed before we were able to get the attention of a server to order drinks. The restaurant was half-empty.

It seemed we weren't assigned a server at all. Each person in the restaurant helped us at some point.  This meant that we needed to explain our dietary restrictions numerous times and I never knew who to look for when I had a question or request.

The seared tuna sashimi appetizer was fresh-out-of-the-refrigerator cold and the chimichurri was overpowering. Miso soup and edamame were fine. The noodles were one-dimensional. The nigiri sushi was nice, but I really didn't need to see more chimichurri.

Will I return?  For takeout, maybe."}
{"text":"La qualité de même que la grosseur des morceaux de poissons est sans reproche. L'hamachi fond littéralement dans la bouche. Belle carte des vins et quelques uns d'entre elle sont abordables. Seul ombre au tableau, le service est un peu imparfait... Mais on y retourne c'est certain."}
{"text":"I recently went to RP and I have to say it was an outlier experience...! Let me explain, most sushi and/or Japanese restaurants today are a copy of a copy of a copy (you get the point!); this was not, this was different. The twist of new Asian flavours AND textures (outside of the norm) took me by surprise. The creativity behind each dish was candidly inspiring. And the presentation, each mix of ingredients (whether a fish skin or a seed) was a authentically hand crafted work of art. This place IS different, and yes expensive. In this world we live in, you don't get something (great) for nothing. It's worth the $plurge."}
{"text":"I've stopped using Yelp for sushi. Most reviews are done by people who are happy to get a good spicy tuna roll.
But in this case, the critics and the hype let me down as well.

We went for lunch and the place is beautiful, with a matching beautiful staff as well.

And we asked for the 7-piece Nigiri \"Chefs Choice\" ... when I referred to it as \"Omakase\" he mentioned that there's a $70CAD full Omakase option and if we would like that? We said yes as we were sitting at the Sushi Bar and were really thrilled about this...

The omakase began with a chilled soup, which was great
From there it continued to go downhill
The next course had overcooked shrimp

Then came 7 pieces of Nigiri
It always makes me nervous when the chef pre-cuts and makes all the pieces together, instead of presenting them one-at-a-time for Omakase... but so be it
As long as it tastes good, right?

The fish was rubbery, the rice was dry... and the only time you didn't notice these things is when it was covered with a shishito pepper or maple syrup glaze... etc

Next came the Sashimi... the only tasty piece was the tuna, and that may have been cause it was lightly seared and had (i think) truffle salt on it.

Next, the Maki roll with mushroom and three types of fish. It may have been the best thing I had. I realized this should've been a \"special maki rolls\" type sushi experience instead of some creative Nigiri thing.. but oh well...

That Maki roll had a ton of mushroom on it (reminiscent of Bibimbap mushrooms), my partner had trouble eating it because it was massive with all the stuff on top.

Overall, a big disappointment given the hype and anticipation and positive critical reviews. Definitely wasn't worth the long uber trek from Vieux Montreal and back."}
{"text":"It is hard to find good sushi in Montreal but Chef Antonio Park's food is delicious and definitely falls into the category of delicious sushi. If you can, do the tasting menu and I recommend sitting at the chef's table as you get to see all the activity of the kitchen. Chef Park makes sure his customers are taken care of and they receive the best experience."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere! Had the Omakase 5 course tasting menu and my fiance had the 6 course one. Everything was delicious and the waiters explained everything expertly! I will come back every time I visit Montreal!"}
{"text":"Being one of the most famous restaurants in Montreal, Park is definitely one of the good sushi places. However the prices can be steeper than other sushi joints that offer the same quality of fish. The lunch menu at park is the way to go! Much more affordable than the dinner one, and you still get the choice of omakase as well! The fish is fresh, and the portions very reasonable. Note that it's a fusion type of place so you can get some pretty interesting flavour combos - all of which were delicious!"}
{"text":"Great dinner in a long time. Came all the way from Toronto to have this chance to eat at Parks's restaurant and this did not disappoint. We had the omakase dinner. 
Started of with a fragrant lemon grass soup. Then it was a polenta cake with nordic shrimp, crab and pickled mushroom the dish was amazing which was such a thrill to the upcoming dishes. We then had chef parks signature nigiri topped with an assortment of condiments. It changes the whole perspective of the soy sauce wasabi sushi. Chef gave us a complimentary uni hand roll with ikura, blew my mind on how fresh it was. The tenderloin for the omakase  was too beautiful to eat. A painting on a plate. The steaks flavor was out of this world. 
We then had a bowl of sashimi. The albacore tuna with steak spice was almost like \" meat \". The urchin 2 kinds were amazing & was so fresh. Unfortunately  the tuna wasnt that good. It was an o-toro, but wasnt \"melt in ur mouth\" 
Dessert was the least favourite though it looked nice, a petite pistachio cake with mango mousse and pineapple, ive had better.
Over all a great place to be at. Thank you chef"}
{"text":"VIBE 
Firstly, the restaurant is the ideal size and you can tell it's a real neigbhourhood place. A true medium sized resto. Not too big, not too small but just right - intimate yet with a little space (like we all want in our relationships, restaurants or otherwise). Chef Antonio Park and his manager Helen are rockstars and will cater to your requests. If you're at the chef's table, you are in luck! 

THE FOOD 
I had come from a 7 course tasting meal that night so honestly, I don't remember all of the food. I do know that Antonio imports all of his fish privately from Southern Japan and in the freshness, you can tell! I don't usually eat sashimi because I don't trust where it comes from but here, I'm eating it. Antonio has one of the most spotless kitchens I have ever seen anywhere. 

That said, I do remember the buratta with a bit of an asian take on it. Pheonemnal. Also, I remember the fish he served with truffle oil sauce and a bit of chimichurri (Park grew up in South America so you'll get some of those influences). This was all because he asked what we liked and didn't like. Truly incredible service. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Park yourself here again and again. I really think it's one of the most underrated restaurants in Montreal and worth the trek (or you could just cab it!)."}
{"text":"Hands down the top place for sushi in Montreal. It doesn't come cheap, but with this chef's international experience and creativity, it's a must try."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place and we finally went for pre-Christmas Christmas dinner.
The ambience is nice and classy but not pretentious. The setting is simple, lighting is good, not too bright but not too dark, just enough so you can see your food properly (and snap pics, lol!)
We started off with some cocktails: one had nori, one had litchi and one had watercress, all were delicious! 
We went for the Chef's Choice 6-course menu. Prepare to eat because it may not seem like a lot of food when the 1st course comes out, you might be unbuttoning by the 3rd course (we actually had to take our dessert to go because we couldn't possibly eat more)
Now, I'm certain I do not need to say too much about the quality of the food as chef Antonio Park has quite a reputation but I will say that it was absolutely worth the walk in the -15°C from the metro to get there. Even -30°C I'd still do it. Amazing pairing of different ingredients and the fish were very fresh. Let the pictures show you what the experience was like and go there to judge for yourself. (The ONLY thing I would say was that the crust on the seared halibut was a tad too salty for my taste but it paired incredibly well with the hazelnut butter)"}
{"text":"The bomb. Foodies, add this one to your list !

Park has some of the freshest, most delicious sashimi I have never had. The fish melted in my mouth. Treat yourself to their 5-course tasting menu which will include sashimi, but also great dishes such as an asian noodle soup, poached lobster and seared fish. 

An absolute must."}
{"text":"After having heard so many great things about Park , needless to say I was looking forward to trying it for myself ! It definitely lives up to the hype :) This is a great restaurant for a special occasion or fancy date night , they do have some tables for groups that look to fit approx 6or so people. The decor is very pretty and modern but still inviting and warm. While the prices are little bit elevated the quality of the food and service makes it worth it. I tried the yuzu gin cocktail which was nice and refreshing. For dinner we had the tasting menu and every part of it was awesome ! It started with a seafood soup-delicious broth , fresh seafood and on a cold night it really hit the spot. Next came a wagyu beef appetizer with crispy rice and greens and a poached egg, this tasted almost like a version of a mini bibimbap , very flavourful and the beef melts in your mouth :) then came the sushi (chefs choice pieces) , it was so fresh and beautifully presented  and paired with amazing little sauces and special touches each one tasted unique and delicious .  We also had the blackened cod with house made noodles , while this dish was very tasty I just wish the cod would have had more of a crispness on the blackened portion. Their dessert was also beautiful and yummy without being too heavy (it was a white chocolate and raspberry cake with raspberry sorbet) ,it satisfied our sweet tooth without being overly sweet, a great end to a great meal! I believe they do serve Sunday brunch as well but have not yet tried it for myself (Also useful note , they do take reservations and accept credit&debit cards and cash.)"}

{"text":"If you heard that Park is one of the best restaurant in Montreal, if not in Canada, you are very mistaken. The sushi is not even 25% as good as the sushi at Yasuda in New York. It's fine if you never had great sushi. In the words of Gordon Ramsay, fusion? \"more like confusion\""}
{"text":"Not the best sushi experience in my life, but it's a staple in Montreal and also a must-try! Although it's on the pricier side, the quality of the fish makes up it. 

The service we had was impeccable and the waiters were knowledgeable about the food being served and took their time to explain everything. 

To enjoy the experience, I think you have to like both traditional Japanese sushi and American fusion sushis."}

Unquestionably, when Chef Park himself is behind the counter (and in the kitchen), the restaurant hums. When I consider what makes a successful sushi restaurant (to my amateur eyes), having a chef (or itamae) who is as involved as Park is in his restaurant is key. It doesn't hurt that Park's waza - his technique, his training, his expertise - is impressive, a point I'll touch more on later.???

But when he's not there, service lags, dishes are forgotten, and preparation suffers. My personal favourite was watching one of the chefs yell at an older-but-maybe-junior chef for a dirty station, justtttt loud enough that the entire sushi counter could hear every condescending word.

But even with the warts, Park seems like a cut above the alternatives. And yes, I haven't lived in Montreal long enough to try them all, so send the hate mail to info@thesushilegend.com. While you're doing that, I'll finish this review. 

The Food
??
One of the reasons that Park is so popular is the broad appeal of its menu. To better serve the multitude of tables behind the sushi counter, Park offers both raw and cooked dishes a la carte. The Omakase - which Mrs. Sushi Legend and I both chose - is also on offer, though I'd caution it's not the standard nigiri-by-nigiri progression that some of you might be used to.

Our first two courses - a small piece of Filet Mignon in broth and vegetables and shrimp/spot prawns three ways - were solid, if unremarkable. Serving anything using three different preparations will always appeal to my sense of adventure, and I could literally eat shrimp heads all day (Park's are excellent). But if you aren't as adventurous, a fair warning - it may not be for you (specifically the little guy on the far right).

Next, my personal favourite - six pieces of nigiri that are literally making me hungry as I stand here typing (seriously, try using a standing desk. It will change your life). King salmon, famous for the buttery texture and Yellowtail belly, full of fat and flavor, melt in your mouth. The Chu Toro, garnished with continental sturgeon roe (aka caviar) and a chive, was a small taste of the quality in the sashimi platter to come. I was also impressed with the preparation for the two pieces of nigiri from the whitefish familia. 

Anecdotally, I find that most North American sushiya that serve sashimi as part of their omakase will do so before serving nigiri. Park does the opposite, by taking the highlights from the light snack of nigiri and cranking the dial. Did you like your Chu Toro nigiri? Well here's 4 perfectly cut pieces of Chu Toro sashimi to enjoy. Appreciate the Tuna? Here's a dozen pieces of Albacore, Akami (Lean Tuna) and Katsuo (Bonito) sashimi. Throughout, Park himself stood behind the sushi bar, impressively (and uniformly) cutting the fish. But in a familiar refrain, when Park leaves his spot, the quality seems to suffer; Exhibit A (or is it B?) was the chef who had decided that slicing fish was a race he had to win. I've sat with many great Itamae, all of whom were masters at being deliberate and precise with their cutting movements.

Park's Omakase is priced at $85+ (ours was $95),which is pricy for Montreal but reasonable for many tourists from more expensive sushi locations. If spending $100 on sushi isn't for you, I would focus on ordering Park's strongest offerings - it's raw fish -  assorted a la carte, including the Nigiri Moriawase (12 pieces, $39) or Sashimi Moriawase (18 pieces, $39). 

Park restaurant is an open, expansive, square room buttressed with high ceilings and dim lighting. Regardless of where you sit in the restaurant, you'll have a clear, direct view past the sushi counter into the kitchen. And your ears will have clear contact with that familiar buzz, the one that might be familiar to visitors of any Trendy Restaurant. That said, whether you enjoy sitting at Park - or prefer a more understated room like Shoushin in Toronto - is entirely up to personal preference. Personally, I enjoyed the ambiance of Park.

In the end, it was actually the service that failed to match the food and setting. Far too often we were left alone with finished plates or waiting for upwards of 45 minutes for the next course. Again, you might have a different personal preference, but for us, 2.5 hours for a 5 course tasting menu is far longer than necessary, especially when sushi is involved (you don't exactly need time to preheat the oven). My concerns about service were only magnified when I realized our drink orders had been forgotten and certain meal components were a complete unknown to the staff. Like many larger restaurants - I'm looking at you Zuma - Park's service likely suffers from its scope. But unlike Zuma, Park's food (read: sushi) makes a visit more than recommended, especially if Chef Park himself is onsite."}
{"text":"Raving about trying out the tasting menu at the famously well spoken of Park restaurant in westmount montreal. I was immensely impressed and so was my boyfriend. We are both very big sushi fans and have heard wonders but last night we took it upon ourselves to try it, due to a special occasion.

We had the omakase tasting menu which consisted of a 5 course meal. Entree which was a miso based tofu with crunchy quinoa , octopus and kobe beef bits. Textures and tastes were phenomenal. Then we had the coho salmon with a yuzu and tomato based reduction , the specialty nigiris came after; so we had a chance to try a selection of rare fish, a plate of spicy salmon maki rolls came in next with a ginger shrimp topping and finally a simple elegant sashimi bowl for each of us that consisted of blue fin tuna with caviar, irish salmon and japanese butterfly fish. Amazing food and even greater service. The wait staff truly knows how to operate as a team and their attention to detail really mesmerized us. Completely worth every penny and highly recommend it! 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"My meal here summarizes easily:

Organic hipster asian fusion with poor service. 
$30 chirashi bowls and $7 miso soup at lunch time should come with water refills. 

Food is good quality, but lacks authenticity.

If you want to try, make reservations."}
{"text":"I went for a lunch and surprisingly didn't have pre-information here -as I was really new at Montreal at that time and a friend suggested to hang out. 

My first impression was not bad. The server was really nice and I could definitely feel that I am well treated as I visited a pricey restaurant. :) 
However, I personally thought the food was a bit hyped in a way that the taste itself was somewhat- \"hmm...\" We tried sushi platter and several small plates (chicken rice, yam noodle). The plates were beautiful and all ingredients were fresh and fancy. However, the taste was not what I expected, the combination of the fancy ingredients ruined the taste. I almost felt the chef sacrificed the balance of the texture & taste for including on-trend ingredients (such as super food grains..).

Maybe I'd visit again for dinner and only for sushi (as the freshness is important)  but still, I can't help saying this place is hyped."}
{"text":"The sushi is, for lack of a better word, ordinary. 

I understand the popularity of the place based on the nigiri, which are quite exceptional. The chef really has a way with them. However, the maki I tried were \"meh\". You don't get to choose your maki... It's chef inspired. I had one with unagi and one with salmon and basil mayonnaise... They were nothing special.

The bibimbap was not as good as most places. They make it with brown rice and quinoa, which is great. However, the vegetables they use are steamed instead of marinated, so they fall flat. The dish also becomes very watery since the stone is not hot enough and the egg just stays very liquid even when mixed in. Veggies are watery too. Very disappointing. 

Miso soup was good.

Service is nice, even if a little pretentious. They charge for extra ginger, which is a little surprising for a restaurant of this caliber... But not a big deal."}
{"text":"Excellent food, fantastic experience! We all got the tasting menu (long version) which was well worth it. 

The tasting menu started with a dashi based soba noodle soup with mussels. Then we had horse mackerel tataki, nigiri (including bluefin tuna), sashimi and maki with ceviche. The dishes really combined Japanese with South American flavors which was cool. We finished it off with a chocolate cake dessert. 

I would highly recommend Park!"}
{"text":"The place looked romantic and expensive. However, there's no room for your parkas since they crowd the space with tables. It's hard to get around, especially for waiters. We got lucky and got the last 2 seats along the bar for a Saturday night at 5:35 pm. We were told ahead that we could stay only til 7 pm. The open kitchen was near us to see and observe the chef and all the cooks in the kitchen. I saw my dish ready to go too!! 

The washroom was large and clean. The service was wonderful and the waiter knew what he was talking about. 

Appetizer - butternut squash soup (Jap style). I loved every spoon of it. Would have loved it hotter, in temperature. 

Park bowl - is their version of a Korean bibimbap for $19. The sauce was not overpowering which was great. The Muti-grain rice is healthy which I like. And all the veggies that I got was wonderful. The tofu was hot and soft. Downside, I didn't know that food modification cost $5!!!!! I asked for a well done egg!! And usually a bibimbap does not come with a hard boiled egg. I've had it pan-fried. So that was a disappointment that cost me $5. I know it's not much, but at least tell me. (Waiter already told me that the tofu might cost me an extra $5.) At least the food was hot from beginning to end. 

My partner had a sushi roll. Presentation is spectacular. Taste wise- he said he had it better, especially in Richmond Hill Ontario. 

Overall, it was a nice experience. I would only go back for a celebration and if I was in Montreal."}
{"text":"Freshest fish i've tasted in town for sure, since it's \"acupunctured\". Went for a second time last thursday. Very creative the tasting menu portions are too small so ordered makis and nigris the second time. Loved the asian salade. Seems they are trying to make everything kobe beef, surf and turf in a fusion restaurant that claims to also be a sushi restaurant. Wish they only concentrated on the fish instead having only one maki on the menu. But it was one of the best maki i've had in a long time. Love the japanese herbs in the sashimi great  attention to details. Also had the coconut cream white chocolate cake amazeballs. Didn't get the kimchi touch to be in the oyster dipping sauce. Overall everyone is a bit confused at the menu but hey isn't what fusion really is? Fusion=confusion but as long as my tastesbud is happy and confused..."}
{"text":"T'sé quand tu dis que quelque chose est « intéressant » parce que ça n'est pas tout mauvais mais loin d'être positif ou extraordinaire? C'est un peu comme ça que je décrirai Park.

J'ai aimé...
* L'attention aux détails dans la présentation des plats.
* La simplicité de choisir un menu dégustation.
* La pétoncle. La meilleur pétoncle grillées que j'ai mangé depuis vraiment, vraiment, vraiment longtemps!
* Le Ceaser au kimchi. J'aurais le goût de retourner juste pour le Ceaser. C'était difficile de se retenir pour ne pas le boire d'un seul trait tellement il était bon!

J'ai moins aimé...
* Être interrompue à toutes les 5 minutes pour me demander si je voulais me faire remplis mon verre d'eau. Soit vous pouvez simplement remplir mon verre sans toujours me demander si j'en veux plus, soit vous venez un peu moins souvent, ou bien vous me laisser la bouteille sur la table sans que j'ai à payer pour. On parle quand même de l'eau de robinet!
* Avoir à demander après 15 minutes avec la table complètement vide, zéro drinks pour la facture. Pourquoi ça prend tant de temps à payer quand j'ai fini de manger?

Et j'ai trouvé comique...
* La grosseur des tables et des assiettes! Les serveurs ne peuvent même pas poser l'assiette de ceux qui sont au fond donc il a fallu qu'on passe tout, allant des ustensiles aux assiettes à ceux qui étaient au fond. Les assiettes des plats principaux étaient tellement grandes qu'on aurait du un plateau utilisé par des traiteurs.

C'est très dispendieux alors réservez ça pour des occasion très spéciales. Les prix pour l'heure du lunch ont l'air beaucoup plus raisonnables que ceux du souper, et les options de menu quand même intéressantes."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I am not a huge fan of raw fish but my 2 Asian friends from Vancouver are and they were in awe over the delicious sushi. 

The guys behind the counter kept starring at our table. ..like non stop and whispering to each other.  Not professional so minus 1 star.

You can't go into a restaurant of that calibr pay a $500 bill for 3 girls while having 3 teenage boys employees whispering and starring at ur table.the whole time. 

Get ur little boys in line park! Keep up the amazing Japanese cuisine!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with a group of 7 people. I made the reservation about 2 weeks in advance, and was told over the phone that the entire table had to go with the omakase (tasting) menu; luckily for our crew, that was completely fine.

We all arrived on time and were seated around a horseshoe-shaped booth. The ambiance of this place is a cool elegance and the music was really good and not too loud.

I lived in Vancouver for so many years, that I have always scoffed at the very idea of sushi in Montreal but several people I know (and trust food-wise) told me that Park was off the charts awesome and that I would love it. Perhaps my expectations were set too high and it pains me to only give the place 3 stars, but I have definitely had better sushi before; many times before.

The omakase menu started with a soup, it was quite good. It was followed by the oysters. They were fabulous and the chimichurri sauce was a really tasty, unexpected pairing. The scallop that followed up was incredible: cooked just right, seasoned perfectly...I could have eaten an entire plate of those. Next came the sashimi...although presented beautifully, only 1 of them had a unique taste (the salmon) and the rest were very bland and indistinguishable from the others. The seared ahi tuna which came after arrived on the biggest plate I have ever seen. I normally love seared ahi, but this one was very overcooked, white throughout, salty and chewy; I didn't even eat half of it as it hurt my jaw to chew it. The dessert however was delicious, simple and yummy.

The pros: cool cocktail list, great wine selection, amazing desserts, the oysters and scallops, prices.

The cons: many of the dishes

One more con: being asked every 5 minutes if we would like more water (their policy is to only leave a bottle at your table if you purchase a bottle, but if you are just drinking plain old water, well then too bad, you will be asked for a refill over and over again: felt almost bullied into buying bottled water)

All in all, the reviews are too good to not give this place one more chance...perhaps they had an off night, a late fish delivery...I dunno. I want to love Park, so stay tuned for an updated review once I give it one more go."}
{"text":"We had heard so many great things about chef Antonio Park and we were not disappointed! Everything on the menu sounded amazing but finally we decided on the Omakase Menu. It is a 5 course meal that is different every day. Our meal consisted of a kimchi soup, crab and fennel salad, a plate of nigiri , seared arctic char with vegetables and a cauliflower pure and a green tea tiramsu for dessert. It was a fabulous meal, the presentation was beautiful and service was impeccable. I noticed that other reviews have said that the omakase menu is 75$ per person, it is not, it is actually 65$ per person and a must try!"}
{"text":"Hubs and I ate the chef's tasting menu last night here and it was great. We sat at the chef's table, which felt a bit cramped (it's basically like sitting at a sushi bar) but you do get to see the chefs hard at work. 

We were served four dishes and a dessert, which we polished off with two bottles of sake. Every dish was excellent but the highlight was eating a whole uni still in its shell, swimming in a dashi/ponzu broth. 

The staff was wonderful and friendly. Chef Park even made an appearance at the end of the night to greet us."}
{"text":"I'd been to Lavanderia, chef Antonio Park's other restaurant, and had loved it! See my review. So I'd been looking forward to going to Park for quite some time. Plus he just looks so darn cute on Chopped Canada. Anyway, the sushi is just out of this world! You gotta try the specials. I had a roll that had mushrooms on it! It's not cheap, so save up before you go."}
{"text":"I'm really sorry to break this to you but this place is really not what you'd expected. Through chef Park's Instagram I was literally looking forward to this culinary experience that we forgo to try other MANY prominent restaurants in Montreal and went to try Part restaurant.

Yes, everything looks clean and you got all hyped up. I saw the price and it was really expensive. It was almost as expensive as Las Vegas Wynn hotel mizumi expensive. Really expensive!!! But I thought, it would be worth it for that price so I ordered what I always wanted to try. 

Nigiri moriawase: I felt rice and sashimi on top didn't communicate with each other. They suppose inseparable but I can taste rice (warm, not cold enough to be sushi rice, and mushy.... Probably because it was warm) and sashimi (I can see he tried to do something to not make it boring but it's still not enough) SEPARATELY!! 

Seasonal maki: what was that?!? Lol the only if there's any positiveness about this maki is the crazy big size that you probably have to break your jar for it. Japanese sushi in general, it suppose to be delicate and intricate embodied with elegance... Trust me. When you try to eat this, there is no elegance. Ladies, if you are on a date, don't order this. Apart from gigantic size, the roll was really not worth of close to $30. I rather order steak from Keg than to it this. The inside was all \"tartared\" up and there was literally nothing to chew other than their mushy rice. I couldn't feel any fish in there. Combination of ingredients? You still got a long way to make it better, chef Antonio. 

Sashimi moriawase: I don't know what was I thinking to order this. Oh yes, because I thought Park restaurant would be better than another place!! WRONG!! Nothing is special about it. It's just your typical sashimi platter with so predictable, obvious choice of sashimi. 

With two beers (around $10 each) and tax came about $140.

My verdict? It was nice to finally be there and experienced it but I am definitely not going back there. Really.... Chef Antonio.... You got more studying to do.... Or maybe I have been to too many good restaurants that I don't think you were worthy of $140."}
{"text":"Food is very good but who charges $5 to remove an item from a dish? I asked for extra ginger and they told me it would be an additional $5. Other than that it was good."}
{"text":"Trust in your ingredients. Showcase the product. My enjoyment of the TV show Top Chef Canada has made these statements stick in my head to the point where they just sound like stupid TV buzzwords now. However, there is definitely something to be said for a more restrained approach - one where things are not overdone. The freshness and unique flavours of the ingredients are allowed to shine. Restaurant Park definitely falls into this category of locale. 

Park is the brainchild of chef Antonio Park, formerly of Kaizen and someone I had heard many great things about. Funny enough, I'd had lunch there very shortly after the place opened and before word-of-mouth had actually developed. Fast-forward over a year later and I was back for dinner - very specifically for the Omakase, the chef's tasting menu. When one comes to Park, this was apparently the way to do it. Simply let chef Antonio and his staff work their magic.

The first course was a Heirloom tomato soup with jalapeno and fried plantain chips. Now given this was a warm summer evening, the presence of a warm soup as a entree was a little odd but the flavours worked well enough. Nice sweetness of the tomatoes with the spicy of jalapeno mixed nicely. The consistency of the soup was nice and smooth all the way through. The fried chip added some crunch and the use of plantain added a little extra sweetness.

The second course was a zucchini flower stuffed with veal sweetbreads and tempura fried on a bed of heirloom tomato with 12 yr old Balsamic vinegar and natural yogourt. This looked so good that I forgot to take a picture before digging in so pardon the half-eaten one below. The sweetbreads were cooked perfectly. The tomatoes and the vinegar provided some acidity to balance the fattiness of the veal. The tempura added a nice crunch as well.

The next course was the Nigiri plate. This was the main event of the evening. Chef Antonio has a private fish import license so he brings over fresh, never frozen fish from places like Japan a few times a week. In some cases, the fish has been send over using Kaimin tai technique where the fish has been acupunctured to maintain a high level of freshness compared to traditional methods of killing and shipping fish. we were served 6 different kinds of fish - each on top of sushi rice and a small additional element/seasoning. The extra elements ran the gamut from a tapping leaf to chimichurri to marinated caviar to maple syrup and fresh wasabi. This was pretty much the freshest sushi I have ever eaten. Simple and elegant, there was no need for wasabi or soy sauce hence why there wasn't any of the table anyway. The fish just fell apart in your mouth and the little extra each added a unique element but without overpowering the natural flavours of each fish. This Nigiri has probably destroyed my future enjoyment of Nigiri anywhere else in Montreal so I guess I will need to stick to maki rolls outside of Park.

The fourth course was fresh brown butter BC halibut on a plate of razor clams, radishes and Quebec corn. The overall technique and execution here was flawless. Beautifully fresh and flaky halibut with a wonderfully rich brown butter sauce. The combination of clams, radishes and corn add some lightness to the rich sauce. A very nice main course dish.

The final course was of course dessert. Chef Antonio served us Patbingsu, a Korean dessert of shaved ice and sweetened azuki beans. The flavours of the shaved ice were cantaloup, pineapple and watermelon and that was augmented with fresh fruits and hazelnuts. For me personally, this was the least successful dish of the evening. To be fair, I am not a fan of melons (yeah I know.... let's just move on from here) so 2 of the 3 flavours didn't work for me but the whole combination of everything felt kind of flat. No real punch or \"wow\" moment. A bit of letdown to finish the meal but the rest of the menu will eliminate this dish from my memory.

Omakase means \"I'll leave it to you\" which in the capable hands of chef Antonio is definitely the right call. Everything Chef Antonio presents you shows a level of respect and reverence for the product which can only be described as elegant. Technique just shines through at every level. Restaurant Park is worth a visit if only to try the Nigiri or Sashimi but I suspect you will find other dishes to enjoy as well. Park may just have driven my sushi standards up a notch but if that means I have to come back more often for sushi, that may not necessarily be a bad thing.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi, attentive staff, the waiter walked us through the menu and helped us order.. Love the atmosphere as well.."}
{"text":"I have been 4 times to this restaurant and it never ceases to impress me! 

First, you absolutely have to get the omakase menu which is the tasting menu including 5-6 items that the chef changes accordingly to the new arrivals.  And do get the places right in front of the sushi bar to be able to look at the crazy knife skills of Chef Park.

The most unique feature of this restaurant is how chef Antonio Park goes about to get his fish as fresh as possible.  His efforts to import the fish directly from Japan while keeping it as ecologically as possible are beyond mind blowing.  He uses different techniques such as acupuncture to kill the fish to maximizing its sweetness while minimizing its suffering. His sushi and sashimi dishes are unique such that the garnishes are packed with flavors without hiding the the characteristics of each fish.  The presentation are incredibly visually appealing.

Apart from fish, Park also offers meat and seafood dishes.  The short ribs are absolutely flabbergasting as its flavor is enhanced by its side dishes and oh-so-tender! The 1855 steak is aged for two years and served on himalayan salt block which not only adds to the wow! factor but also gives the surfaces of the meat this salty crust.  His desserts are also creative, colorful and deliver an array of promising flavors and texture!

All in all, restaurant Park is definitely a must-try as you really cannot find any better dish fresher and tastier than his! The chef is there every single day and has such a great passion in every single dish that comes out of his kitchen!  Ah and they also offer lunch and brunch on saturday.

We decided on sharing a 95$ tasting menu and a 115$ tasting menu suggested by our waiter. It was ALL delicious! The soup, the rice, the tataki, the sushis, the sashimis, the chicken, the makis, the rice down to the desserts!!! The wine list is ok. A bit too much American wines (i'm more of a french wine kinda gal). The  cocktails are original and you obviously have sake and beer. The service was excellent! Everything was spot on. 

I thought that the minimalistic design of the restaurant pleasing but my husband would prefer something \"warmer\", more \"decorated\" as he would put it lol!

On the very pricey side: 400$ tax and tips. This place is, for us, a \"very special occasion\" place.

Btw...you get real chopsticks and not those \"pull apart\" ones. Now that's NICE!"}
