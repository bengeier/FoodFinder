{"text":"It's hard to find a delivery pizza joint with buffalo chicken pizza! This place has it and it's REALLY delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"When they first opened I quickly switched from my old pizza place to this one and ordered at least twice a month.  Why after eating there for 2 years do I give them 2 stars?  Due to them making the same mistake multiple other places have made here in Charlotte.  Just because you have one successful place DOES NOT mean you should open 2 more.  You split your good staff among 3 locations and the food and service suffer because you don't have enough good staff.  They may eventually recover but 10 new pizza places will be open by then.  Food - inconsistent Service - friendly Pricing - sometimes makes no sense - $6.99 for Garlic Bread when a Chicken Cutlet Parm Hero is $6.99?  That's either the most expensive garlic in the world or the worst chicken.  Not sure which."}
{"text":"We have given this place so many \"2nd\" chances but they continually fail. Last night was the last straw. Repeat offenses: the bread used for their sandwiches is hard as a rock - I literally could not bite into the one I ordered - and way too much bread for the amount of meat on the sandwich. The regular hand-tossed crust has come to us more than once almost transparent in the middle it was so thin (and limp). And lastly, we ordered the Sicilian thick crust last night and after waiting for an hour, it came to us burnt (the crust was black) and most of the toppings were on the top of the box. We called and complained. After another hour, they showed up with the crust burnt AGAIN (I mean BLACK), and the center was like a huge pile of raw dough - gross! It wasn't worth going through it again so we just threw the $23 pizza away. That's it. We are officially done and have just decided to throw the menu away for good."}
{"text":"Great Sicilian pizza! We ordered take-out and everything was easy. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Great pizza, our favorite intown. Sorta ny style. Just check it before you leave. The staff is not very good, more often than not, our order is messed up. We have ordered pasta dinner combos and got home and things missing, pizzas not right. Called on a Saturday night and they were \"out\" of pepperoni... It's a pizza joint how can you be out of that? And why did no one go to a local store and get more?"}
{"text":"Good pizza, subs and paninis. Was surprised based on location (old gas station) but really enjoyed my fresh panini and husband sub had lots of meat. Will go back on next trip up there."}
{"text":"I have had hit or miss here but the last two times I have order delivery it has been quick, fresh and hot.  The Sicilian pizza is very good.  Also a fan of the Godfather sub."}
{"text":"Wow, I am surprised about all the negativity on here re:  Mama's.  I always have my husband pick it up or get it delivered. The subs are huge and AWESOME, never been a problem with my order.  It's a treat to get pizza from Mama's!  Be your own judge!  WE go to the Huntersville location"}
{"text":"Great food. We have called in for food to go. Many, many times over the last 2 years. We love the food and of course the people who work there.  You rock Nicky. See you tomorrow! !"}
{"text":"Our car broke down and had to be towed. Luckily we had Mama's to feed us while we waited for our ride. Delicious! And the added bonus was the gluten free options - my doctor put me on a gluten free diet two months ago and I thought I'd have to break that. It was delicious, fast and we'll be back when we pick the car up!"}
{"text":"I have never dined in, only delivery so I can't comment on the restaurant building or the dine-in experience.  We absolutely love their subs.  I get the Eggplant Parmesean ($8) and hubby likes the Italian Sausage & Peppers ($7) .  The sandwiches are huge (about a foot long) and a great value.  Their pizza is also great.  You can tell their dough is handmade and they use a high quality mozzarella cheese.    Now why the 3 stars instead of 5.  We hadn't ordered in probably a year so I was excited to call and here the normal, friendly \"Mama's Pizza Express, pickup or delivery?\".  This time a woman answered with just, \"Mama's\" and not so friendly.  I told her our order and was then told that we didn't order enough.  Well it turns out they raised their minimum order to $25.  I asked why and was told that they expanded their delivery range so now they require a higher order price.  Ummm.....Huh?  First, we are only two people so to try to get to that minimum order we have to order extra food that we won't eat.  Second, we only live 3 miles from your restaurant.  We are paying the $2.50 delivery fee and our standard $5 tip for the driver.  So essentially we are happily paying $7.50 for the convenience of delivery.    Now you are telling us that we have to order more food than we want because you decided to deliver further.    On a side note none of their coupons or meal deals are available when you are ordering delivery.  Why not?  Again, we are paying for the delivery."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian delivered to your door!  Try his rice balls.. If you have never eaten them you will find a new food love!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Mama's for a 2 years.  I've never had the pizza, believe it or not, but the subs are very good.  They're big, packed with meat, and feature interesting combinations.    I really like the jars and canned goods on sale there as well, things like cherry peppers, roasted peppers, etc.    They do deliver (but only within 5 miles.)   Service and pricing are about what you'd expect from a carry-out pizza place."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza, great people and the best customer service in the area. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I thought Luigi's is good this place is better.  I also like the fact that they have hard ass NY and NJ Italian  guys working there it reminds me of Weehawken, NJ where I am from. They do not care if you do not like them or their food.  If you do not like it, do not go in there. Toughen up before you go in there.  I get so tired of these soft , pansy ass southern guys.  IF YOU WANT A GOOD SLICE OF PIZZA GO IN HERE AND EAT.  6 bucks- 2 slices and 1 coke.  that is a good deal.  They take cash, only cash, bring cash."}
{"text":"Pizza not very good. Not ready when promised and was like warm and very greasy. This is the third time I have tried this place and is my last."}
{"text":"I called the Huntsville location by accident and I would have to say that the Cornelius store is 100% better. I won't make the mistake of.calling.the wrong store again. And not everyone like the.NY Jerk attitude."}
{"text":"I stayed in Lake Norman/Huntersville for business for a week and the food here (delivered to my hotel) was incredible.   Not only is the pizza my favorite kind - thin and crispy/sicilian style, but they use quality ingredients and it was delivered quickly. I also had a garlic bread with cheese loaf-thing that was TO DIE FOR.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I found this place just cruising from walmart. Tiny joint with great pizza. Some of the best I've had in Charlotte. Quick and nice customer service."}
{"text":"Thank you, Nicky, for the great hospitality today upon my visit for takeout! Pizza was great as always! I've been continuing my exploring for a great authentic pie since I moved here from New Jersey almost 27 years ago. Nice dive! You had me at Frankie's Stromboli! Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Nothing fancy but everyone treats you like family! My family goes at least 3x a week. Everything you order is fabulous!! Customer service is always fabulous!! No need to order from papa johns or dominos anymore and they deliver!!"}
{"text":"NICKY IS THE MAN!!!!!  Being a fellow New Yorker your always on the hunt for a good pie, well hunt no longer !!  The pizza here is very good, the good is delicious and his party subs are awesome. 3 foot hero at a VERY reasonable price and it gets the whole party talking !!  Go see Nick and the boys and enjoy a nice Italian meal !!"}
{"text":"This is the best sauce and meatballs in the world. Nick and the guys are awesome. Subs are unbelievable. A must try for all"}
{"text":"Mmm, the cheese pizza is so good!!  It's just like nyc pizza. Nicky was absolutely wonderful and so welcoming. It's completely worth the drive from wherever your located just to taste this pizza. I am thrilled to find this gem, and will be back.   It's set up more so as a to-go place, but even with that in mind. You can sit outside or there are a couple bar seats. Don't be taken back by the non upscale restaurant appearance. They focus on the quality and taste of the food which is truly upscale.   Cheese pizza- damn good!!! Literally the best in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"New favorite place... pizza hero with meatball salami and pepperoni is awesome.  Cheese steak was good.  Rolls are good they don't sog thru like most rolls.. not sure if they are amoroso.  I am from Philadelphia and miss wawa meatball sandwiches. . This hopefully will fill that gap.  Haven't tried the pizza yet.   Tonight they messed up our order and we got someone else's slightly toasted plain roll instead of a cheesesteak (hope the person that got our cheesesteak enjoys it) but they are making us another.  We will just make sure to check the order next time.  Hope to be a long time customer as long as the food stays good."}
{"text":"Dive pizza at it's finest.  This family knows how to cook a pizza.  I had high expectations as niche mom and pop pizza places are almost gone these days, but this was AMAZING.   And the Garlic Knots are the best I've ever had.  We ordered pizza, garlic knots, and a desert.  All were amazing!  There is a NY style deli with Boar Head supplied deli meats/cheeses adjoining, as well as a few Italian items for sale, such as sauces, pasta noodles (dried) and other items.  My lady can't stop thinking about this place, and mentions it at least once a week as an option, basically, we're hooked.  Drawback: if its cold/rainy you can't really eat there, it's too small/crowded.  I believe there are 1-2 tables inside and there are a few picnic tables outside.   We went hoping for pizza and beer and were disappointed it wasnt a full restaurant; ended up doing take out, but, wow, worth it, no regrets!"}
{"text":"This is LEGIT pizza and garlic knots. Awesome hole in the wall italian fast food spot. They have a ton of sandwhiches and pizzas. Reminded me of pizza back from new jersey. Def going back!!"}
{"text":"I came here because I just moved to the area and it's the closest sub shop I've seen around.  I had Mama's Meatball Parmigiana and it was great!! I feel the meatballs could using more seasoning but they were still great. Good sauce and the bread was nice toasted but neither stiff or soggy. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great pizza...     Would have given it a 5 but occasionally burnt bottoms and a little inconsistent."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here tonight. I got the breaded chicken cutlet hero which was a little dry. Ir needed a little dressing otherwise it was very good. I also got a house salad which I liked the dressing it came with but the salad itself was disappointing. It was just a box of iceberg lettuce with onion and a tomato. For $5 I think they could've thrown in a few cucumber slices or something. My other half got a Stromboli and a cannoli. He was pleased with both. I gave ordered from here in the past and have never had any complaints. This was the first time I ordered a salad from here I will probably need to reconsider ever ordering that again  in the future."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time a few weeks ago.  I have been bragging about the lasagna ever since!!!!  Can't wait to try the mussels."}
{"text":"I don't remember the pizza enough to comment but it was definitely not like NY pizza or that is something I could have recalled.  Lasagna was ok....too much cheese and chicken parm was good!"}
{"text":"The pizza was great. The cannolis were so good, better than I have had in NYC. The pizza crust had an excellent flavor and the sauce they used is fantastic. They also have authentic NYC accents which is cool. We will return to this place."}
{"text":"Moved here 6 months ago - and we Tried this place after a recommendation from others and from the reviews on Yelp - We've been very pleased and the pizza is super close to what we were used to in NJ! I just wish they had a place to eat inside - but take out is perfectly fine for our purposes most times we get pizza anyway!"}
{"text":"Tried Mama's last night and am still glad I did. The pizza was excellent! Thin crust with a great amount of cheese ALL THE WAY TO THE EDGE OF THE PIZZA (its a huge peeve of mine when pizzerias leave an inch or two of bare sauce before the outer edge of the crust starts). Plus, they deliver! Too bad the garlic knots were like dinner rolls with garlic butter baked on top...and completely raw dough in the middle. I'd definitely go again but just stick with the pizza."}
{"text":"I stopped by to get my monthly fix for great NY pizza and met the owner Nicki for the first time.  As always, my pizza was ready and cooked to perfection.  I also always hit their deli shop for my other NY favorite Boar's Head.  I absolutely love this place!!!!  Best pizza in the Charlotte area if you love authentic NYC pizza.  And the staff are always courteous, friendly and make me feel so welcome.  Please stop by for the \"best of NY\" right here in Huntersville.  Keep up the good work Nicki and see you all soon.  Ray C."}
{"text":"Wow. We just waited an hour and 20 minutes for cold pizza and cold chicken wings, which, notably, were dipped in flour and frozen prior to being fried. For the first time in my entire life, I called a restaurant back to voice my disappointment. The man on the phone tried to argue that flour \"does not have wheat gluten\" in it. My husband has celliacs' disease, as do many Americans, which can send one striaght to the hospital. When I told the gentleman that I can't remember a wing (not a chichen strip, a wing!) ever being rolled in flour, he continued to argue with me, loudly, that I didn't know what I was talking about, and that: \"they ALL come from the company that way\". How nice. When Mama's disappoints you, they have no sympathy. We have to go back out for dinner. Please avoid."}
{"text":"I can't describe in words how much my family adores this place. Don't let the small place with a garage in the back keep you from missing some of the best pizza around. I have tried most things on the menu and have been pleased with the quality and amazing taste every time. Their service is great and I am glad to support a small family business."}
{"text":"We Had to work late one night so my boyfriend ordered a pizza, sandwich, and a couple of cannolis  for us. Everything was absolutely excellent. The pizza is just the right amount of everything. The cannoli was perfection. And he said the sandwich was delicious. Will be ordering from here again and definitely recommended it. It is a little pricey but it is worth it."}
{"text":"I LOVE the pizza here! Nick makes me feel like I'm family when I come in to order and pickup my pizza. Real true NY pizza coming from a New Yorker! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! Favorite place now!! The food and service is amazing! I live by uncc but the drive is going to be so worth it! This is literally the spot!"}
{"text":"This was some of the best pizza I've EVER had. My husband thought the same thing   The bruschetta was phenomenal and garlicky  The delivery took longer than estimated but once we ate the food we couldn't care less!"}
{"text":"We think it's the pizza in Huntersville! It's a great location as far as visibility and brief parking for pick up. They are best at delivering. As long as you know ahead of time that it could take 30-40 minutes for delivery.  We like the garlic lovers pizza, incredible! We also like the meat lovers and vegetarian pizza. I'm sure all of the others are just as good but we haven't ordered those pizzas. Mama's offers fried calamari which is really fantastic for a pizza shop but steer clear of the chicken wings, they are breaded, soft and disappointing.  But these guys know pizza."}
{"text":"I am a connoisseur of good Italian food. And I'm here to tell you that if you want REALLY good Italian food at fair prices....look no further. The pasta dishes are served in delicious sauce with ample amounts of cheese with your choice of meat/no meat. The subs? Are you kiddin' me? There's Not a bad bite of food to be had here. I travel 20 miles and pass plenty of other so-called Italian places to enjoy the seating for two here! These guys are personable and they know what they are doing. If you like Italian food...you gotta try Mama's Pizza Express in Huntersville NC!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there to order a philly steak sub and he ordered a Stromboli. After ordering we stayed inside to watch them make our food. We witnessed them answering the phone, collecting money and making food without washing their hands. They were also answering personal cell phone and NOBODY washed their hands. It was DISGUSTING!!!! We left and will NEVER GO BACK TO THAT PLACE EVER AGAIN!!!! FYI people instead of ordering your food over the phone you should go in and see how nasty they are!! I bet you won't be a returning customer!!!! Disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"$5.25 two slices of pizza + can of soda.  Great little quick snack.  I have had their subs too, good eatin'.  I would have given them a 5 star, but some of the employees are just not friendly.  This is classic NY style pizza!"}
{"text":"Prompt and friendly service- yes, the staff is to the point but really friendly. If you want to be catered to and coddled, ehh not so much. But we're talking about take out pizza here.   New York style pizza- Delicious. Thin crust, cheesy goodness, mildly spicy pepperoni, and just a bit of grease. I wouldn't have NY pizza any other way.   Will I I be back? In a word, YES! Thanks for the the awesome pizza."}
{"text":"There calzone are the best.  Cooked perfect and all Fresh indgredents. Crust was perfect too I'll be back soon ."}
{"text":"WOW! Where is the health dept. ? The place has a 93.  Should be a 63, filthy is the word, food was OK at best, the walls , floors are gross. The employees have time to stand and talk and watch videos on the phone, but no time to clean. Stay away there are much better and cleaner places to eat. Mike"}
{"text":"Subs, pizza and cannoli was allllll on point!!! Nick and the crew are all friendly!!! The best Italian spot ever!!! Oh yeah Shaggy rock!!! Best delivery driver in Huntersville. One stop shopping!!!!"}
{"text":"Having already found our favorite authentic Italian restaurant in Huntersville, we decided to explore outside our norm and try Mama's Pizza Express.   I get what \"express\" signifies, but this place is VERY small with zero accommodations! No bathrooms, no inside tables, and no bread with your ENTREES unless you pay extra. Almost every Italian place I've been to includes a soup or salad with your entree and definitely bread! Not at Mama's Pizza Express.   The prices seem fair except of course if you're a police officer in which case the owner will completely fall head over heels for you and nearly give you the meal for FREE! It was a little disturbing watching the strange, obsessive interaction between the owner and two cops that were ordering out.   We had to send our garlic rolls back because they were completely cold in the middle and at no time did anyone including the owner who was extremely occupied with the cops ask us how our meal was which I rate as subpar and most likely frozen. I would say this is solely a pizza joint, which we doubt we'll return to try.   I think you should definitely give the same level of service and attention to ALL customers especially those who pay FULL price. I'm from Chicago and the Mafia image that the owner attempts to portray is unattractive and unacceptable. Customers don't wanna hear about who got \"pinched\" or who got \"wacked\" REAL Mafia don't talk like that."}
{"text":"My guy and I have a thing we like to do just jump in the car and drive around outside charlotte to explore new places and things. We have found some pretty cool places on these adventures and this was one of them for sure. We stopped in for my guy to grab a bite when hunger struck and after trying his sandwich I only wish I hadn't eaten before that so that I could have had my own.  He ordered the big mama which was a hot sandwich with freshly shaved roast beef melted fresh mozzarella with hot peppers and balsamic glaze. Good gawd. It was delicious he had to fight me off of it. I love the fact that the roast beef was so fresh not over done and cooked within an inch of its life. It was tender and juicy and the combination of the cheese peppers and balsamic made for mouthwatering goodness. by the look of it this place focuses more on pizza so I look forward to going back to try it.  Its a take out delivery place and the only table we saw was a picnic table outside as well as a small bar on the inside really just for waiting for your order to ready it seems.   They also had a small store like area attached to it where you could buy pasta olive oil and vinegar and such. The staff was super friendly and the place was clean. they have a few spots out front for parking but with it being a take out place it shouldn't be hard to nab a spot. I definitely look forward to coming back to try more of the food and this time actually get my own."}
{"text":"Can't believe I have been living in Huntersville for almost 5 years and just tried this place today. The best pizza around! And they deliver!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a combination pizza. It was very greasy and I needed to wipe off grease with some paper towels. The Italian sub was tasty but also dripping and soggy from too much oil. Dinner salad was very large and well prepared with assortment of vegetables and meat."}
{"text":"I feel like I got someone else's pizza (no banana peppers but had black olives instead & thin crust) but it was pretty yummy. Fast delivery"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of cheese pizza but theirs is delicious! Huge menu & friendly service. 93 sanitation rating is not good. This location is small- not really a place to eat in. My two kids love their pizza."}
{"text":"My cousin and I can for lunch and it was sooo amazing!!! We got cannolis and garlic knot pizza.. omg to die for!!!"}
{"text":"We order from Mama's all the time but tonight will be the last time! There was a mistake with our order and we called back so we could fix it. We were not calling to complain we simply wanted to fix the order. The guy with the heavy New York accent started yelling at my husband that he repeated the order back to us and it was our fault if we got the wrong thing.  He said if we bring back the wrong food then he would make us something else.  We decided against it because the man was so rude I was scared he would spit in my food. I have NEVER been treated this way by anyone in \"customer service\" industry. I am a restaurant manager and would fire any employee that ever talked to a customer like this guy spoke to us. Your food isn't that good to be treated with such horrible disrespect."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area, true NY-style. I've never ordered delivery, only pickup. Parking isn't always convenient but there's not a lot that can be done about that. Otherwise it's fast service, good price, and the lunch special is a good deal (2 slices of pizza and a can of soda). Definitely my go-to pizza place."}
{"text":"I am an eggplant rollatini fan. It is my go-to Italian meal. I have ordered this dish from many of the other Italian restaurants in Huntersville and other cities.  Mamas has the best eggplant rollatini I have ever had bar none!  If you want ambiance, go to Mama Mia's, if you want good food, go to Mama's Pizzeria."}
{"text":"Since 4.5 stars isn't possible I'm going to round up and give them 5. I have been ordering pizza from there once or twice a month for about 4 years and the pizza is consistently excellent. It's just really well done NY style pizza with real cheese and toppings.   Be prepared to dab some grease which just means you're getting real cheese instead of processed which has much lower fat content as its full of emulsifiers. If you dig NY style you'll like this place."}
{"text":"Delivery and quality of food is always on point. Our favorite and must try is Grandmas pie & the mozzarella sticks!"}
{"text":"The Guys at Mama's Pizza are the Best! As a small business owner in town, I do Catering with Mama's for varying business parties from 10 to 500.  No matter the Party size, Mama's is always able to accommodate our needs with incredible food and service. Whether stopping in for a quick slice or feeding an army, Mama's Pizza and their Team are the BEST! Ask for Nick or Alex - Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Ate here last weekend, pretty good little spot for a quick bite to eat.  They deliver which is convenient as well."}
{"text":"Our order was ready and they didn't even let my husband know. Our fries were not even cooked all the way through. My salad had a whole block of feta cheese on it. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. The pizza bread was soft and chewy. For the price I paid I would've gotten a much better pizza at domino's and have some change. I was hoping for authentic New York style pizza but it didn't happen."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN THE BEST PIZZA SPOT IN CHARLOTTE!! Call ahead because they're busy all the time, which ensures me that the food is fresh! We just found this dime piece recently and have never returned to our old Pizza joint which is much closer to our house. We drive 15 minutes to get our food BC it is that good! The cheese is something I just can't explain and the sauce is sweet...I love it!! I'm from NY, and this Pizza takes the cake!  It's not just the pizza, the calzone are the best!! A must have!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have been pretty happy with my experience overall.  The service is very good.  I ordered delivery once and carryout the other times.  The staff is helpful in recommending food and giving their personal suggestions on what to try.    My favorite thing to order is the stromboli.  They are so delicious.  I have also tried the garlic knots and Sicilian rice balls.  The knots are good-but beware!!! Extremely garlicky!!!  Don't eat them if you want to kiss anyone or get close to anyone for several days!!  I was not a fan of the rice balls.  They were very rich and filling....I could only eat a few bites, but was glad to try them.    This is a tiny shop, not meant for dining in.  It is well organized and service is quick."}
{"text":"Okay. This might be confusing. When Mama's first opened, it was amazing. Then, the owner wasn't there as much and it went downhill. After being disappointed repeatedly, I stopped going for about one year. Then I gave it another shot (right around the corner) and the pizza was awesome again. So, I tried it again. And the pizza was awesome. Again! So, now I keep ordering and the pizza keeps being awesome. I looked at some of the negative reviews and that seemed to be from when they let the place go a little. They must have had a management change or something, because Mama's is great again."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pizza in the Lake Norman area. Other than that we've had the meatballs, lasagne, antipasta, canolis, a few grinders and stromboli. All absolutely delicious. Have been there at least thirty times and have have been happy pretty much every single time."}
{"text":"Best subs around.  Never had a bad sandwich there.  Healthy Italian, pizza hero, mulberry street, are a few of my personal favorites."}
{"text":"I never used to like their pizza but my fiance loves it and it grows on me everytime we get it. Must like greasy pizza to like this place."}
{"text":"This place is defiantly with the drive from Charlotte.  The pizza is awesome.  Nicky has a great personality...I would recommend coming here for anyone that loves NY style pizza."}
{"text":"Best subs in town.  The Nikki's special is loaded with high quality meats.  It's $13, but worth every penny, could easily feed two hungry people.  Service is great, food is great."}
