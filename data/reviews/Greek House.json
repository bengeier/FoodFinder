{"text":"The staff are very friendly and accommodating. The food (chicken souvlaki) was okay. Not the greatest but I'll certainly not hesitate to have it again. The tabouli was excellent. Very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"This is in the corner of a busy Newmarket plaza. My favourite thing here is the Fried Zucchini with the Tziziki  sauce. They're nice if you pre-order as well. 

Customer service is great! Will always greet you with a smile and bring your order to the table as opposed to you getting up to get it from the counter. My only qualm is that their Washroom was a bit dirty - the light switch especially."}
{"text":"The lunch we had was great. Friendly staff, clean washroom, prices ok and we will be back."}
{"text":"All about the greek salad here, add some chicken souvlaki, or some chicken schwarma on top of it.... a bit of extra feta.... you're in greek heaven ! Fair prices, it's not CHEAP which would be nice... but it's fair for what they offer. Great sauces to add to whatever you are getting. I like this place!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. The man behind the counter must have been the owner/manager. He was down right rude! I cannot believe the way he was  talking to another customer. It just totally turned me off, I left. Never giving that place another chance."}
{"text":"I just started working nearby and wanted a healthy bite so thought I would check it out. I ordered a chicken shawarma on Greek salad and it came up to $15 which is way too overpriced compared to other Greek or Mediterranean restaurants.... all I got was a couple pieces of chicken scattered on a bed of lettuce. I was already not planning on returning but halfway into the salad I noticed one of the pieces of lettuce still had it's sticker label on it... is this place trying to kill people??? Will definitely not be returning 

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, nothing fancy! 


Overall the Chicken Souvlaki was good, not the best, but nothing exceptional. 

They have a hot table with many choices and daily specials. 

One of those places that are a little run down but quality of food is still good. 

Good size for a group of friends and in the mood for some Greek food or Falafels Etc...

Hard to see in the plaza, just a small place, close to the Walmart entrance. 

If your looking for a good fast place to grab something this place fits the bill."}
